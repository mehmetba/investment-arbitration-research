Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala_Second Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction,"86. Claimant explains that its claim of breach of fair and equitable treatment is based upon the Lesivo Resolution and not Respondent's failure to remove squatters. According to Claimant, the Memorial on the Merits clearly states that “the Government's action in issuing the Lesivo Resolution, in violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, served to undermine RDC’s investment-backed expectations, one of which was RDC’s_ reasonable expectation that the Government would protect the railway against squatters.”*”"

Bear Creek Mining Corporation v. Republic of Peru_Award-En,"4. In the case of an alleged indirect expropriation, Annex 812.1 provides guidance on how to distinguish between whether an indirect expropriation and bona fide regulation that does not amount to an expropriation. Whether a measure constitutes a nondiscriminatory, regulatory measure designed to protect public welfare — as opposed to an indirect expropriation — requires a case-by-case, fact based inquiry that considers various factors. The Parties have articulated certain of these factors in Annex 812.1 to guide the Tribunal, including the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the measure or series of measures (for example if the measure is general in nature as opposed to targeting a particular investment). None of these factors will be determinative on its own. Together, they must be weighed along with any other relevant factors."

David R Aven and Others v. Republic of Costa Rica_Award of the Tribunal-En,"Claimants summarize the argument of frustration of the foreign investor’s legitimate, investment-backed expectations, and state that customary international law protects the foreign investor who is engaged in making important decisions concerning the establishment, expansion, and/or operation of his investment in the territory of the Host State. Informed by the principle of good faith, customary international law entitles the investor to expect that municipal administrative, regulatory and adjudicative regimes — and the officials responsible for operating them — will function in a transparent, stable and predictable manner’. The foreign investor, they add, is not entitled to expect perfection from these regimes, but he is entitled to expect officials to execute their responsibilities in good faith, with consistency and in a lawful manner. The investor thus enjoys the absolute right to be free from demands for illegal payments by host State officials — on the threat of withholding or revoking the permits required for the investment to succeed, and should a bribe ever be solicited, his complaint to the host State about the crime will be immediately and thoroughly investigated, in good faith, without suffering any retribution for having reported it to the proper authorities.

To the extent that Claimants could make a claim with regard to a fair and equitable treatment violation under the Russian- Mongolian BIT, Claimants would have to show that their investment-backed expectations were reasonable and legitimate on the basis of the authorities cited by them. As set out above, the question of tax-related treatment requires a showing of reasonableness of expectations that is greater than may have been the case with regard to other subject matters.

To ensure their entitlement to such a concession, the Enterprises have complied at all times with the provisions of the Mining Law, the Environmental Law, and all other relevant Salvadoran laws. Their continued investment in El Salvador has been based on the Government's express support for the Enterprises’ mining operations in the country.*!

Silver Ridge Power BV v.

In particular, after these plants were fully constructed and were providing electricity to the grid, the Respondent replaced the Fourth Energy Account with the Fifth Energy Account, thus abandoning the fixed FIT and instead putting into place a price-support mechanism that only paid the difference between the market price for electricity and a specified nominal amount. According to the Claimant, this measure applied retroactively to plants built and entered into service in reliance on the previous incentive regime. As the revenues under the Fifth Energy Account are insufficient to offset the cost of acquiring, constructing and putting into service the Frosinone plants, they cannot generate a positive return for the Claimant. The measures’ retroactive character combined with their interference with distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations thus resulted, in the Claimant’s submission, in the transfer of wealth from PV investors to the Italian administration, thus confirming the expropriatory character of these measures (Cl.
