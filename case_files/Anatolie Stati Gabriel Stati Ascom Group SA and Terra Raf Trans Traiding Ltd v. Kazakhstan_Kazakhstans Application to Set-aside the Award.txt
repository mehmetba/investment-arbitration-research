Acting as counsel for Republic of Kazakhstan (“RoK”), we hereby submit this summons application
against Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group S.A och Terra Raf Trading Ltd. (hereinafter
jointly referred to as “Stati”) as follows.

(2)

RELIEF SOUGHT

RoK requests that the Court of Appeal, in accordance with section 33 of the Swedish
Arbitration Act (“SAA”), declares the arbitral award rendered on 19 December 2013 in
SCC’s case no. V (116/2010), Exhibit 1, invalid.

RoK requests, in the second hand, that the Court of Appeal, in accordance with section 34
of the Swedish Arbitration Act, sets aside the stated arbitral award, alternatively parts
thereof in accordance with what is set out in this summons.

RoK requests that Stati shall be ordered to jointly and severally compensate Rok for its
costs in the proceedings, including costs for counsel, in by an amount that will be
specified later.

SUMMARY OF ROK’S CLAIMS BEFORE THE COURT OF APPEAL

This request for the invalidity and challenge of the award regards arbitral proceedings
under Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) in which Stati alleged that RoK has breached its
obligations according to the ECT. Stati’s claim for damages in the proceedings totalled
more than USD 3 billion. In an award dated 19 December 2013, with a correction 17
January 2014, the Tribunal sustained Stati’s claim with respect to a breach against ECT
and awarded a quantum of almost USD 500 million.

The arbitral proceedings were very extensive and complicated, which is evident from the
Award consisting of 414 pages. The proceedings included questions regarding the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, matters regarding the applicability of the ECT and relevant law,
among them Kazakh law, as well as, questions with respect to liability and causality and
matters regarding quantum. The correspondence was extensive and the Parties invoked
several experts in geology, law, and economy, as well as, many witnesses. Three rounds
of oral hearings were held where these experts and witnesses were examined.

The arbitral proceedings got off to an unfortunate start when the SCC, and later the
Tribunal, incorrectly considered itself to have jurisdiction to try the case and RoK was
deprived of its right to appoint its own arbitrator. This start caused that following
proceedings in its entirety were out of balance, which also is reflected in the Award. In this
invalidity and challenge pleading the errors will be set forth and can be summarized as the
following.

(i) The fact that RoK has been deprived of its right to appoint its own arbitrator is
clearly incompatible with the basic principles of the Swedish legal system,
alternatively a deficiency in the appointment, or otherwise an irregularity in the

course of the proceedings which probably influenced the outcome of the case.
This will be set forth in section 5.1 below.

(ii) The Award is not covered by a valid arbitration agreement between the Parties
because STATI failed to abide by the three Month “Cooling Off” Period in article
26 ect and which constitutes a condition in Rok’s offer. This is set out in section
5.2 below.

(iii) The Award is not covered by a valid arbitration agreement between Rok and
Terra Raf. This is set out in section 5.3 below.

(iv) The Tribunal failed to consider pivotal witness evidence regarding the Quantum
of the LPG Plant. This is set out in section 5.4 below.

(v) The Tribunal has its date and has it several pi
mistakes and by ignoring the submission of expert evidence and other evidence
regarding almost every major disputed issue of the case. This is set out in
section 5.5 below.

(vi) The Tribunal failed to consider the RoK’s objections that certain deductions
would need to be made from an eventual award. This is set out in section 5.6
below.

(vii) The Tribunal has ded its de and has it dural

 

Dp
irregularities by going beyond the submissions of the Parties and by ignoring the
parties’ submissions and the applicable law on multiple occasions. This is set
out in section 5.7 below.

In summary, the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction. Hence the Award, in its entirety, shall
be declared invalid in accordance with Section 33 (1) p. 2 in SAA. In any case, this error
entails that the Award shall be set aside in accordance with Section 34 (1) p. 4 in SAA.
The Tribunal’s handling of the arbitral proceedings has also included several excesses of
mandate and/or procedural irregularities which influenced the outcome of the case. The
arbitral award shall therefore, in any event, be set aside entirely or partially in accordance
with Section 34 (1) p. 2 and 6 in SAA.

INTRODUCTION

The Parties

RoK has been an independent state since 1991. On 17 December 1994, RoK signed the

Anatolie Stati holds passports of Moldova and Romania.
Gabriel Stati holds passports of Moldova and Romania.

Ascom Group S.A. (“Ascom’) is a joint stock company incorporated under the laws of
Moldova, with headquarters in Moldova, and located at 75 A. Mateevici Street, Chisinau,
MD-2009, Republic of Moldova. Anatolie Stati claims to own 100% of Ascom.

Terra Raf Traiding Ltd. (“Terra Raf”) is a limited liability company incorporated under the
laws of Gibraltar, and is located at Don House, Suite 31, 30-38 Main Street, Gibraltar.
Anatolie Stati and Gabriel Stati claim to each own 50% of Terra Raf.

Background

Hydrocarbon in the form of oil and natural gas is RoK’s main natural resource. Since RoK
became an independent state in the early 1990s, RoK has attracted foreign technical and
financial investment to help the country to recover these natural assets in order to develop
the country’s economy and by extension to get its people to benefit from it.

The Government of RoK is the highest authority responsible for managing investments
and exploration of the country’s natural resources. It should also be noted that RoK has
an extensive legislation of subsoil exploration contracts and of those companies operating
in this line of business. The reason to the extensive legislation is the immense importance
of exploitation of RoK’s natural assets and the necessity to ensure safety of such
operations.

During 1999, Stati researched the possibilities to invest in extraction of RoK’s natural
resources. To that end, Stati acquired in several steps 100% of the shares in the
companies Kazpolmunai (“KPM") and Tolynneftegas (“TNG”).’ On 9 December 1999,
Ascom acquired 62 percent of the shares in KPM that owned the subsoil use contract to
the oil field Borankol. On 17 May 2000, Stati acquired the 75 percent of the shares in
TNG, which owned the subsoil use contracts to the natural gas field Tolkyn and also the
prospect rights to the so-called Contract 302 Area (also called the Tabyl Area).

As a result of the transactions, Ascom became the owner of 100% of KPM and Terra Raf
became the owner of 100% of TNG. The transactions were not transparent and the
objective of the complicated corporate structure, which included a number of
intermediaries, was unclear. RoK has questioned the validity of some of these
transactions.

KPM and TNG explored and developed oil and gas fields in the vicinity of Opornaya, in
the Mangystau region. Specifically, KPM explored, developed and later produced from the
Borankol field, which is a predominantly oil bearing field. TNG explored, developed and
later produced from the Tolkyn field, which is predominantly gas bearing. In addition, TNG

explored the so-called Contract 302 Area (also referred to as “Tabyl Block”), an area in
which Stati hoped to find further hydrocarbon reservoirs. Potential leads in the
Contract 302 Area were called “Munaibay Main” (also “Munaibay East”), “Munaibay
North”, “Bahyt”, “Tabyl” and “Interoil Reef’.? Ultimately, Stati never developed any
producing fields from the Contract 302 Area. In 2006, TNG also initiated activities to
construct a Liquefied Petroleum Gas Plant (the “LPG Plant’).° The purpose of an
LPG Plant is to filter hydrocarbons such as propane and butane out a stream of so-called
“wet” or “rich” gas. The LPG Plant was never finished.

The exploration and development of the fields and the Contract 302 Area was approved
by the state under three separate subsoil use contracts, namely Contract No. 305 dated
30 March 1999 (for the Borankol field), Contract No. 210 dated 12 August 1998 (for the
Tolkyn field) and Contract No. 302 dated 31 July 1998 (for the Contract 302 Area).*

The alleged acquisition of KPM and TNG by Stati

Of the various acquisition steps regarding the shares in KPM and TNG, the most disputed
one in the arbitrational proceedings was the acquisition of 100% of the shares in TNG by
Terra Raf from Gheso S.A. In particular, the Parties disputed whether the State's pre-
emptive right to acquire shares in a company holding a subsoil use contract applied to this
transaction.

Financing of Stati’s activities in Kazakhstan

Throughout their activities in Kazakhstan, Stati relied largely on debt financing. At the end
of 2006, Stati refinanced their previous loans by way of a public debt offering of
USD 300 million. To that end, Stati established a company called Tristan Oil Ltd.
(‘Tristan’), incorporated in the British Virgin Islands (“B.V.I.”). Overall, until the summer of
2009, Tristan issued public debt in the form of debt notes in the amount of
USD 531.1 million.® The debt was guaranteed by KPM and TNG. The details of the
Tristan note structure will be discussed in section 5.7 below.

Inspections and audits of KPM and TNG

On 6 October 2008, the Moldovan President Vladimir Voronin sent a letter to
Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, accusing Anatolie Stati of using proceeds
from Kazakhstan's mineral resources to invest in areas subject to UN sanctions, in

particular, in South Sudan.° Further, the letter alleged that Mr. Stati was concealing profits
in offshore territories and that he was bribing officials in Moldova.

As a response to the allegations by President Voronin, President Nazarbayev issued a
letter to Kazakhstan's Deputy Prime Minister and to the Head of Kazakhstan's Financial
Police in which he asked “/ajt the request of the Moldavian party to carry out a thorough
inspection of the company activity and to decide on its further operation in the interests of
the country’.” In the following, in October and November 2008, a phase of inspections of
KPM and TNG by various state authorities took place. Those inspections were instigated
by the Financial Police and were intended to establish whether there was any truth in
President Voronin’s allegations.

The first phase of inspections also resulted in a number of assessments of taxes and
duties by the Kazakh Tax and Customs Committees. As a result of the inspections and
audits, various irregularities in the operations of KPM and TNG were found. /nter alia, a
suspicion arose that KPM was operating a trunk pipeline without the necessary license for
that kind of operation. Moreover, it was found that KPM and TNG had applied incorrect
amortisation rates for certain exploration expenses in their annual tax declarations. What
is more, irregularities with regard to the transfer of the shares in TNG from Gheso S.A. to
Terra Raf were uncovered.

The suspicion regarding KPM’s operation of the trunk pipeline without a license led to a
criminal investigation with the aim of finding out whether there were any individuals who
had committed the crime of Illegal Entrepreneurial Activity (Article 190(2)(b) of the Kazakh
Criminal Code). Illegal Entrepreneurial Activity describes any activity conducted without
the necessary license leading to profits on a large scale. In the course of the criminal
investigation, searches of KPM’s and TNG's premises were conducted.® Ultimately,
Mr. Cornegruta, the General Director of KPM, was charged with the crime. On
18 September 2009, the Aktau City Court found him guilty and convicted him to a four
year prison sentence. At the same time, the court determined that a recovery order
against KPM was necessary in order to collect the illegal income.

In February 2009, the Kazakh Tax Committee determined that because of the application
of the wrong amortization rate, KPM and TNG had to pay back taxes in the amount of
USD 62 million. The companies appealed the decision which was ultimately upheld by the
Kazakh Supreme Court.?

In addition, in December 2008, the Kazakh Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
(‘MEMR’) re-inspected the matter of the pre-emptive rights waiver in connection to the
transfer of shares in TNG from Gheso S.A. to Terra Raf. It was found that the transfer

occurred only in 2005, making the state’s pre-emptive right applicable. Consequentially,
the MEMR asked TNG to submit a new application for the transfer. '°

In 2008 and 2009, KPM and TNG were hit hard by the effects of the financial crisis. Oil
and gas prices as well as demand dropped significantly in that time period, putting
considerable pressure on the companies’ revenues. At the same time, a successful
operation was necessary in order to pay the interest on the Tristan notes. In this time
period, KPM and TNG curtailed their expenses for the development of the Borankol and
Tolkyn fields, thus skipping necessary well work-overs. In addition, the construction of the
LPG Plant was suspended."

In June and July 2010, the General Prosecutor's Office initiated inspections of KPM and
TNG based on allegations that the companies had infringed the rights of their employees
as well as breached a number of contractual and legislative obligations. On 28 June 2010
the General Prosecutor's Office had received a complaint from individuals living in the
Beyneu District of Mangystau Province, where the Tolkyn and Borankol oil deposits as
well as the KPM & TNG oil exploitation infrastructure were situated. The subject of the
complaints were violations in the activities of KPM and TNG related to non-payment of
salaries, mass dismissal of employees, failure to comply with environmental legislation
and legislation on subsoil use. The complainants requested the General Prosecutor's
Office to take measures to prevent the loss of hydrocarbon resources and to establish a
stable social environment. *

In response to the complaints it received, the General Prosecutor's office instructed a
number of agencies to undertake inspections of KPM and TNG (resulting in a so-called
complex or comprehensive audit). These inspections revealed a number of infringements
by KPM and TNG, in particular violations concerning unauthorised emissions, discharge of
sewage water, nonfulfillment of earlier directives toward eliminating violations, non-
performing of environmental monitoring activities, absence of a record on waste, failure to
meet the target rates on drilling, non-fulfillment of exploratory works, failure to keep a
record for flared gas metering, non-fulfillment of obligations regarding accommodation and
training of Kazakh employees, violations concerning personnel not receiving safety
training, absence of orientation, delays in salaries in June 2010 as well as employees
being called back to work from vacation without consent. The obligations regarding
payment toward the decommissioning costs fund and reimbursement of past costs were
not fulfilled either.

Ultimately based on these violations, the Kazakh Ministry of Oil and Gas (“MOG’”, the
successor of the MEMR) terminated KPM’s and TNG’s subsoil use contracts on
21 July 2010." In the following, the fields as well as the facilities on the fields were taken

into trust management by KazMunaiGas National Company (“KMG NC")"*, the Kazakh
state oil company, and by its subsidiary KazMunaiTeniz (“KMT’).'° The operation is not for
profit but in order to maintain and preserve the fields. The unfinished LPG Plant does not
form part of the trust management. It remains unfinished and mothballed.

The Arbitration Procedure

On 26 July 2010, only five days after the termination of the subsoil use contracts, Stati
filed a Request for Arbitration with the SCC, claiming that RoK had violated its obligations
under the ECT. As is set out in further detail in section 5.2 below, by submitting within five
days from the cancellation of the contracts, Stati violated the requirement of
Article 26(2) ECT to go through a three month “cooling off” period.

In the arbitrational procedure, Stati stated that an alleged harassment campaign was
conducted by Rok’s authorities against KPM and TNG. In a “scattergun approach”, Stati
alleged that RoK had violated practically every substantive investment protection standard
contained in the ECT.

In this submission some events of the proceedings will be stated in following:

e On 23 September 2010, the SCC Board decided that the seat of arbitration for the
case is Stockholm.

« The Tribunal consisted of Professor Karl-Heinz Béckstiegel (Chairman, appointed by
the SCC), David R. Haigh QC (Defendants’ appointee) and Professor Sergei
Lebedev (appointed by the SCC). RoK objected against the appointment of
Professor Lebedev by the SCC. This will be further set out below.

The following written submissions were made by the parties:

° — Stati’s Request for Arbitration dated 26 July 2010;

e — Stati’s Statement of Claim dated 18 May 2011;

. Rok’s Statement of Defence dated 21 November 2011;

e — Stati’s Reply on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 8 May 2012;

e — Stati’s Reply on Quantum dated 28 May 2012;

e — Rok’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 13 August 2012;

« — Stati’s and Rok’s First Post-hearing Briefs dated 8 April 2013;
e — Stati’s and RoK’s Second Post-hearing Briefs dated 3 June 2013.
Moreover, three hearings were held, each time in Paris:

e Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability after the submission of RoK’s Rejoinder on
Jurisdiction and Liability from 1 to 8 October 2012;

e Hearing on Quantum after the submission of the RoK’s Rejoinder on Quantum from
28 to 31 January 2013;

e Final Hearing (examination of geological experts and closing submissions) after the
submission of the First Post-hearing Briefs on 2 and 3 May 2013.

Throughout the arbitration, Stati’s claim for damages varied considerably."° Ultimately,
Stati asked for compensation in the amount of USD 478,927,000 for the Tolkyn field,
USD 197,013,000 for the Borankol field, USD 96,808,000 for Munaibay Oil,
USD 329,077,000 for the LPG Plant and USD 1,626,155,000 for the Contract 302 Area,
which totals USD 2,727.980.000 with interest. Further, Stati claimed also compensation
for general damages equivalent to 10 percent of the total damages that Stati has
claimed. '”

Alleged basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

Stati based their arbitration claim on Article 26 ECT." According to Stati, RoK offered
arbitration under the auspices of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (the “SCC”) by
ratifying the ECT including its Article 26, and Stati accepted the offer by initiating
arbitration proceedings with their Request for Arbitration submitted to the SCC on
26 July 2010 and therefore a binding arbitrational agreement was reached.

In the course of the arbitration, RoK rejected the argument that the preconditions for an
offer to arbitrate under Article 26 ECT were fulfilled. RoK continues to reject Stati’s
arguments relating to jurisdiction and denies that jurisdiction existed. The respective
grounds for challenge are set out below.

The Award

On 19 December 2013, the Tribunal rendered the Award finding that RoK had violated its
obligations under the ECT and ordering RoK to pay USD 497,685,101.00 in damages and
USD 8,975,496.40 in costs of legal representation to Stati. The arbitration costs were to
split between the parties, with RoK having to bear % and Stati having to bear 14. Interest

to the damage sum applies as of 30 April 2009 at the rate of 6 months US Treasury Bills,

compounded semi-annually. All other claims were dismissed. °

In substance, the Tribunal rejected all of RoK’s jurisdictional objections.®° Further, the
Tribunal found RoK in breach of its obligations under the standard of fair and equitable
treatment contained in Article 10(1) ECT.*' The Tribunal also found that the actions taken
by Rok’s authorities caused damages and that there was no intervening cause ruling out
the awarding of damages.” Specifically, the Tribunal awarded USD 277.8 million in
combined damages for the Borankol and Tolkyn fields, USD 199 million for the LPG Plant
and USD 31,330,000 for the Contract 302 Area.” Of these amounts, the Tribunal
deducted USD 10,444,899 in debt for which it considered Stati to be no longer liable

following the alleged breach by RoK.”*

Professor Lebedev dissented on jurisdiction and Mr. Haigh dissented on parts of quantum.

None of them provided a separate dissenting opinion.

On 17 January 2014, the Tribunal issued a correction to the Award according to Article 41
of the SCC-Rules and Section 32 of the SAA. In the correction, the Tribunal stated that
after issuing its award, it had discovered that its decision did not sufficiently specify the
costs of arbitration as required by the SAA. It hence corrected the operative part of the
award contained in section N. by adding sections 4.01, 4.02 and 4.03 setting out the
arbitration costs incurred for the arbitrators and in form of the SCC Administrative Fee.

Otherwise, the award remained unchanged.

DOCUMENTS AND TRANSLATIONS IN THE COURT OF APPEAL

The arbitration was conducted in the English language. The arbitral award, which is
attached to this summons application, is drafted in English. We request that the Court of
Appeal accepts the arbitrational award in its original form. If the Court of Appeal suggests
that the parts of the award, which are cited in this summons and is relevant to these
challenge proceedings, we can most certainly provide with such translations. The
documentation relied on in the arbitration and which is invoked in these proceedings will
be submitted in English, and with an in-house translation into Swedish in relevant parts, if

the Court of Appeal so accepts.

CHALLENGE GROUNDS

The fact that RoK has been deprived of its right to appoint its own arbitrator is
clearly incompatible with the basic principles of the Swedish legal system,

alternatively a deficiency in the appointment, or otherwise an irregularity in the
course of the proceedings which probably influenced the outcome of the case

Introduction

One of the most fundamental principles for an arbitral procedure is party autonomy, i.e.
that the parties are in charge of the dispute themselves and have a right to appoint their
own arbitrators. The right for a party to appoint its own arbitrator is a matter of legal
security. If a party is denied the right to appoint an arbitrator, it affects the balance in the
Tribunal and the entire arbitral procedure. Lindskog calls this condition “influence balance”
and emphasizes

‘[t]he fact that the requirement of ‘influence balance’ shall be set high does just
not have a theoretical importance, it also has a practical importance. [...] The
fact that the order for the appointment of the tribunal is such that there is
‘influence balance’ ensures a balance of the parties’ interests with respect to the
composition of the arbitral tribunal.”*°

Even in cases when the Tribunal has been entirely impartial, a tangible violation can be at
hand if the respondent did not have an opportunity to appoint its own arbitrator.”°

Rules which provide for the appointment of an arbitrator on behalf of one party if it defaults
are by themselves not unproblematic as this means that one party has a party appointed
arbitrator, while the other has not and the parties are therefore not treated equally. This
may, however, be considered acceptable or justified if the other party has had a true
opportunity to appoint its arbitrator but deliberately failed to do so. It is not, if deadlines are
so short and the other party is not informed of the other party's requests.

Such a case can rather be compared to an arbitration agreement which from the outset
only grants one party the right to appoint its own arbitrator while the other party would
have an arbitrator imposed on it. There can be no doubt that such an arbitration
agreement would violate the principle of equality of the parties. An award that is the result
of an arbitration based on such an arbitration agreement would therefore clearly violate
public policy and consequently, the award should be considered invalid.

The Tribunal which decided this dispute consisted of one arbitrator appointed by Stati and
two arbitrators appointed by the SCC. The appointment of an arbitrator by the Board of
the SCC was brought about by several violations of fundamental procedural rights of RoK

and the SCC’s own Rules; namely, (i) the SCC failed to conduct a proper prima facie
review of the Request for Arbitration and thus failed to detect that the arbitration was
initiated in breach of the three month cooling-off period, (ii) The SCC incorrectly assumed
that RoK should have appointed an arbitrator with its Answer to the Request for
Arbitration, (iii) the SCC acted in violation of due process and the principle of equality of
the parties by stipulating deadlines that were too short, (iv) the SCC did not afford RoK the
right to be heard when appointing an arbitrator on behalf of RoK, and (v) the SCC did not
afford RoK the right to be heard when appointing the Chairman of the Tribunal.

For these reasons, the Award must be declared invalid in accordance with Section 33 p. 2
SAA. Alternatively, the Award should be set aside in accordance with Section 34, p. 4 and
6 SAA, because the Tribunal thus appointed did not have jurisdiction and because the
SCC committed a procedural mistake that affected the outcome of the case.

Facts

Stati filed its Request for Arbitration on 26 July 2010. Accordingly, Stati filed its Request
for Arbitration merely five days after KPM’s and TNG’s agreements on subsoil use rights
had been terminated. Stati requested arbitration without having adhered to the three
month cooling-off period stipulated in Article 26 of the ECT (see section 5.2 below).

The SCC received the Request for Arbitration on 3 August 2010 and forwarded the
Request to RoK two days later, stipulating a deadline to respond only three weeks later.””
The Request for Arbitration consisted of 40 pages and was accompanied by 42 exhibits.
In the Request for Arbitration, Stati had proposed that the two party appointed arbitrators
jointly should appoint the Chairman. In its letter, the SCC requested RoK to submit its
answer in accordance with Article 5 of the SCC Rules. It did, however, not explicitly inform
Rok that RoK also should appoint an arbitrator in its answer.

The letter was addressed to the Ministry of Justice, the authority referred to in Stati’s
Request for Arbitration as the “governmental authority likely to represent Kazakhstan in
this proceeding.” The Request for Arbitration and the SCC Secretariat's letter were
drafted in English. The official languages in RoK are Kazakh and Russian. None of the
previous communication between the Parties had been in English.

Apparently, the SCC did not take any further measures to ensure that the request for
arbitration was sent to the correct addressee. SCC instead relied on information from Stati
that the Ministry of Justice “probably” was going to represent RoK.

The secretariat of the Ministry of Justice does not formally register letters that are in a
foreign language but rather immediately attempts to deliver them to the Vice Minister
(Executive Secretary) who supervises the assumed competent department. The Ministry
does not have any information as to when the Request for Arbitration was received by the

secretariat of the Ministry. The Ministry's files do however suggest that it received the
Request on 11 August 2010. This means that the three weeks deadline for response in
fact amounted only to a 15 day deadline.

On 27 August 2010, the SCC reminded RoK to submit an answer to the Request for
Arbitration and set a new deadline to 10 September 2010.” This letter was received by
the secretariat of the Ministry of Justice on 31 August 2010 and by the relevant
department on 1 September 2010, thus stipulating effectively a 9 day deadline.

It is stated in the letter of 27 August 2012 that the failure to submit an answer would not
prevent the arbitration from proceeding, but it is not stated that the SCC would appoint an
arbitrator on behalf of Rok.

Stati made a request on 13 September 2010 to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of RoK.
The SCC forwarded this request to RoK on the same day.*° Unlike the prior and the later
communications, this letter was not sent by courier but by registered mail. While this letter
was still travelling to RoK, on 20 September 2010, the SCC — without having informed
RoK about this - wrote to Professor Lebedev to inform him about his appointment as
arbitrator. One day later, Professor Lebedev accepted his appointment*" and on 23
September 2010 the SCC sent a letter to the Parties to inform them about the
appointment. The SCC had thus appointed Professor Lebedev within 40 days from the
Republic’s receipt of the Request for Arbitration.

On the same day - 23 September 2010 - that the SCC sent out the letter informing RoK
about Professor Lebedev’s appointment, RoK received Stati’s request that an arbitrator
should be appointed on its behalf.

Without further communication, the SCC also promptly appointed Professor Béckstiegel
as the Chairman of the Tribunal. On 27 September 2010 he accepted his appointment as
Chairman and on the following day, the SCC dispatched a letter to the Parties, again by
courier, informing them about the appointment. All of this happened while the internal
process in RoK of deciding on the competent authority and then engaging legal counsel
was still ongoing.

On 2 December 2010, subsequent to having engaged legal counsel, RoK challenged the
appointment of Professor Lebedev as arbitrator on behalf of RoK, arguing that the SCC
had appointed Professor Lebedev without Rok’s consent and prior consultation with RoK
and without giving RoK an adequate opportunity to select its own arbitrator.°°

(61) This request was quashed by the SCC by a decision of 15 December 2010 with one
sentence stating that no ground for disqualification of Professor Lebedev had been
found.** RoK reiterated its protest at the Procedural Meeting on 15 December 2010 as
evidenced by Procedural Order (“PO”) No. 1.

(62) In a further letter to the SCC dated 27 December 2010, RoK maintained its objection. In
the same letter, RoK complained that the SCC had not responded to its question whether
Margrete Stevens of King & Spalding, Stati’s attorneys, had participated in the Board
decision. The SCC replied that this had not been the case.

(63) The sequence of events leading to the appointment of the Tribunal can be summarized as
follows:

26 July 2010 — Stati filed its Request for Arbitration

3 August 2010 — The SCC receives the Request for Arbitration

5 August 2010 — The SCC forwards the Request for Arbitration to RoK by courier,
sets a deadline until 26 August 2010 for response (no explicit request to appoint an
arbitrator)

11 August 2010 — Receipt of letter by Ministry of Justice

27 August 2010 — SCC asks RoK to respond until 10 September 2010, sent by
courier, no explicit request to appoint an arbitrator

1 September 2010 — receipt by relevant department of Ministry of Justice

13 September 2010 — Stati requests the SCC to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of
Rok

5.1.3 The SCC has an obligation to safeguard fundamental procedural rights of the
Parties such as a Party’s right to appoint its own arbitrator

(64) The SCC as the administrating institution has a duty to safeguard the Parties’ fundamental
procedural rights, in particular at the time when a Tribunal has not yet been constituted.

(65) In accordance with Article 47 of the SCC Rules, not only the Tribunal but also the SCC
itself in all matters not expressly provided for in these Rules, shall act in the spirit of these
Rules and shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that all awards are legally
enforceable. Time periods, as well as the process when such time periods have expired,
are matters which do not expressly appear from the SCC Rules. Further, in accordance
with Appendix 1, Article 9 SCC Rules, the SCC is under a general obligation to deal with
the arbitration in an impartial, practical and expeditious manner.

(66) Both provisions demonstrate that the SCC is under an obligation to observe certain
fundamental principles such as due process and equality of the parties. If the SCC does
not do so, it undermines the enforceability of an award.

(67) In the present case, the SCC was under an obligation to ensure that RoK was given a
reasonable opportunity to respond to the Request for Arbitration and to appoint its own
arbitrator because the right to appoint an arbitrator is a fundamental right in international
arbitration. This is particularly so when there is the risk that one party can easily appoint
its arbitrator while the other is prevented from doing so.

(68) In an article, Doak Bishop, now partner with King & Spalding, and Lucy Reed have
highlighted the importance of a party's ability to appoint its arbitrator:

“In the common international arbitration scenario of a tripartite panel, with each
party appointing one arbitrator and the party-appointed arbitrators then selecting
the presiding arbitrator, each side's selection of ‘its’ arbitrator is perhaps the
single most inative step in the arbitration. The ability to appoint one of the
decision-makers _is_a defining aspect of the arbitral system _and provides a
powerful instrument when used wisely by a party.”*° (emphasis added)

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 19 of 92

There is agreement among legal scholars that the appointment of a party's arbitrator is
paramount because this arbitrator also has a certain role to play, in particular to see to it
that the case of the nominating party is properly understood:

“The advantage to a party of being able to nominate an arbitrator is that it gives
the party concerned a sense of investment in the arbitral tribunal. Each party will
have at least one judge of its choice’ to listen to its case. This is particularly
important in an international arbitration where, in addition to the matters formally
in issue, there may well be differences of language, tradition, and culture
between the parties and, indeed, between the members of the arbitral tribunal
h Ives. An arbit i by a party will be able to make sure that the
case of the inting party is properly by the arbitral tribunal._In
particular, such an arbitrator should be able to ensure that any
misunderstandings that may arise during the deliberations of the arbitral tribunal
(for instance, because of differences of legal practice, culture, or language) are
resolved before they lead to injustice."** (emphasis added)

 

The possibility and right of a party to appoint an arbitrator is a safeguard to ensure that the
arbitration is conducted in a neutral manner taking into consideration the positions of the
disputing parties.*” Gary Born states that in case an arbitrator is appointed on behalf of
one party,

‘[t]his is the loss of a significant right: a co-arbitrator selected by the arbitral
institution may be competent, but the party's ability to select its preferred co-
arbitrator is a key feature of the arbitral process with substantial practical
importance.”

With direct reference to investment arbitrations, Charles Brower states that

“The right of the parties to appoint the arbitrators has existed for decades, even
centuries. (...) [T]he Germany-Pakistan BIT (1959), provided for party-appointed
arbitrators, as did one of the first BITs providing for investor-State arbitration, the
Netherlands-Tunisia BIT (1963).

Today the right to appoint an arbitrator is included in most BITs, all of the major
international arbitration rules, and many of the world’s domestic arbitration laws,
including the UNCITRAL Model Law. (...) In light of this extensive historical
background, it would seem that the right of the parties to appoint the arbitrators
has become an established principle of law in international arbitration.”*°

(72) In this case, the appointment by the SCC of Professor Lebedev as arbitrator on behalf of
Rok has had unfortunate consequences. Professor Lebedev took a very passive role
during the arbitral proceedings and thus has not been able to ensure that Rok’s
presentation of its case has been correctly perceived by the Tribunal. This deficiency is
evidenced in several grounds that form the basis of this challenge of the Award and that
are presented below in sections 5.2-5.7 below.

(73) Certainly, as most arbitral rules accept, a party forfeits its right to appoint an arbitrator if it
does not use that right. However, this fundamental right must not be taken away lightly
from a party.“° Indeed, if a party is deprived of this right, this is probably incompatible with
the legal system in many countries, including Sweden and therefore a Tribunal thus
appointed does not have jurisdiction, which also means that the arbitral award is invalid, if
the party has not explicitly has refrained from its right to appoint an arbitrator.*’ This is
something that the SCC should avoid at all costs as it is under an obligation to secure the
enforceability of an award.

(74) Safeguarding a party’s right to appoint its arbitrator is a question of due process. Equally,
it is question of equality of the parties. When one party can exercise its right to appoint its
arbitrator and the other party cannot, this is a severe breach of this principle. As for
example the French courts have frequently held, the principle of the equality of the parties
must be observed in international arbitration “as a general principle of procedure founded
in procedural public policy”.“ In the famous Dutco case, the French Cour de cassation
held that the principle of the equality of the parties in the designation of the arbitrators is a
matter which concerns public policy.**

(75) All of this should have been clear to the SCC and it was under an obligation to act
accordingly in order to ensure the enforceability of an eventual award and in order to treat
the parties impartially. It is further under an obligation to act in a practical way, which
should entail that all deadlines need to be realistic for the relevant party in regards to
relevant circumstances in every case.

acceptable, but not the other. A waiver of a procedural right would not only be a threat to the individual's fundamental

democracy and the state governed by law’.

and thus failed to detect that the arbitration was initiated in breach of the three
month cooling-off period that is provisioned in the ECT

 

The SCC should also have noted that Stati submitted the Request for Arbitration without
having adhered to the three month “cooling-off” period prescribed by Art. 26 of the ECT.
Such a three month period would not only allow the Parties to negotiate a potential
settlement, but it also serves the purpose of making RoK aware of the need of seeking
legal advice. Had Stati adhered to this cooling-off period, RoK would indeed have been
able to prepare for a potential arbitration, inter alia by selecting legal counsel that would
then have participated in drafting the Answer to the Request for Arbitration and would

have prepared the appointment of an arbitrator.“*

While Stati in their Request for Arbitration alleged that they had adhered to this cooling-off
period,” the SCC should have reviewed the documents relied on by Stati in this regard as
part of its mandatory prima facie review and would easily have seen that none of them
contained a formal request for amicable settlement. Hence, the SCC should have noted
the shortage in Stati’s Request for Arbitration already in the prima facie assessment of
jurisdiction. If that had been accomplished, the following problems about the appointment
of Professor Lebedev as an arbitrator on behalf of ROK, would therefore have been

avoided.

5.1.5 The SCC incorrectly assumed that RoK should appointed an arbitrator with its

(78)

(79)

Answer to the Request for Arbitration

The letter from the SCC dated 5 August 2010 with the attached Request for Arbitration
contained an order for RoK to, within a specified time frame, submit a response to the
Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 5 of the SCC Rules. The letter contained no
order for RoK in this response to also appoint its arbitrator. The SCC's reminder on 27
August 2010 contained only a notification that RoK's failure to submit an answer would not
hinder the continuing of the arbitration proceedings. Apparently, the SCC assumed that
the Answer should include an appointment of an arbitrator even though the SCC Rules do
not stipulate this under the circumstances of the case at hand as neither an agreement on

the number of arbitrators nor a decision to that effect existed yet.

It should be noted that the SCC Rules on the appointment of arbitrators deviate from what
is stipulated in the mandatory rules of the Swedish Arbitration Act. In short, the SCC Rules
entails an obligation of the board of the SCC to order a respondent to appoint an arbitrator
within a time limit decided by the SCC Board. Only when it has been established that the
respondent has not appointed an arbitrator within this time limit, the SCC Board has a

right to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the respondent.

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 22 of 92

With regards to situations where the Swedish Arbitration Act applies, the respondent is
obliged pursuant to Section 14 of the SAA to notify the claimant in writing of its choice
within 30 days from receipt of the notification. The provision entails, firstly, that that a
definite time limit is set out by law, i.e. 30 days. Secondly, it states the day from which the
time limit is counted, i.e. the day of receipt of the notification (the time limit cannot be
amended by court upon the request of a party). Thirdly, it follows the rule that the
obligation of a respondent to appoint an arbitrator arises only if it received a notice from
the claimant. Thus, the claimant, in its request for arbitration, does not need to request
that the respondent shall appoint an arbitrator within the specified time limit. The
respondent's obligation to appoint an arbitrator instead follows by law. This is evidenced
by the provision in Article 19 of the SAA. However, the claimant must in this document
indicate who he has appointed as arbitrator.

The provisions in the SCC Rules on the appointment of arbitrators differ substantially from
what follows from the SAA. A basic difference is that the number of arbitrators shall not
invariably be three. If the parties have not agreed upon this, the number of arbitrators shall
be decided by the SCC Board pursuant to Article 12 of the SCC Rules. Thus, it is not
possible to, in proceedings administrated by the SCC, build the initial stage of the tenets
of the SAA, i.e. that each party shall appoint one arbitrator. It should be noted in this
regard that Article 2(1) of the SCC Rules states that the request for arbitration shall
contain, inter alia, comments on the number of arbitrators. The connected provision (vi)
shall be understood in light hereof; a request for arbitration shall contain “if applicable, the
name, address, telephone number, facsimile number and e-mail address of the arbitrator
appointed by the Claimant’.* As the number of arbitrators is not decided at this time, the
provision is designed so that the claimant does not have to appoint an arbitrator in its
request for arbitration, as opposed to what follows from Article 19 SAA. It is here important
to notice that Article 26 ECT does not stipulate the number of arbitrators, but only refers to
the SCC Rules.

With regard to the answer to the Request for Arbitration, the SCC shall specify the time
limit within which the respondent shall submit this.“” In this regard, it should be noted that
the obligation to answer, pursuant to Article 5 of the SCC Rules, does not entail an
obligation on the respondent to appoint an arbitrator, but instead merely provides that the
answer should include details of who the respondent has appointed as arbitrator "if
applicable", i.e. corresponding to what is stipulated for the Request for Arbitration
pursuant to Article 2 of the SCC Rules. Thus, a request from the SCC to a respondent to
submit an answer does not entail an obligation to appoint an arbitrator. As appears from
SCC's letter to RoK dated 5 August 2010, the event that the respondent fails to answer
does not hinder the continuing of the arbitration proceedings.*® However, the rules do not

entail a right for SCC to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the respondent if it has failed to
answer the Request for arbitration.

The SCC's mandate to appoint arbitrators follows from Article 13 in conjunction with
Article 9 (3) of the SCC Rules. Article 13 of the SCC Rules provides for a time limit for the
respondent to appoint its arbitrator. In the event any of the parties fails to appoint an
arbitrator within the set time limit, the SCC Board has a right pursuant to Article 13(3) of
the SCC Rules to appoint the arbitrator. The time limit set for a party to appoint an
arbitrator is decided by the Board, and its length may vary.

Before the SCC has decided a time limit pursuant to Article 13(1) SCC Rules, the Board
may not appoint an arbitrator on behalf of the respondent. The same should thus apply if
the respondent has not received a notification on its obligation to appoint an arbitrator
within the stated time limit.“

Stati’s Request for Arbitration indeed contained a request that the arbitration should be
decided by three arbitrators and Stati had further appointed their arbitrator. However, the
SCC is not bound by a party's request in this regard, but must, if the counter party does
not accept the number of arbitrators, make a decision on the matter pursuant to Article 12
of the SCC Rules. SCC’s Board can thereby decide that the arbitration shall be decided
by three arbitrators, which is the main rule, or by a sole arbitrator.

In present case, the SCC has deviated from what follows from the SCC Rules. The letter
from SCC contained no order for RoK to appoint its own arbitrator. The deadline specified
in the letter is only focused on the response to the Request for Arbitration. In any event,
any such decision was never made by the SCC in this case.

The SCC acted in violation of due process and the principle of equality of the
parties by stipulating deadlines that were too short

As has been demonstrated above, the SCC has a duty to ensure that the respondent is
provided with sufficient opportunity to appoint its arbitrator. Art. 5 of the SCC Rules
stipulates that the Secretariat shall set a time period within which the Respondent shall
submit an Answer to the SCC. As the Rules do not provide for a specific time period, this
matter is not specifically regulated by the Rules. The SCC therefore has certain discretion
to set this time period (however, see below). In exercising such discretion, the SCC needs
to ensure that it acts in a practical and impartial way and that it ensures the execution of
an eventual award. The SCC should be aware of the limits of this discretion, which also
means that there can be no general deadlines but rather that every deadline needs to be
carefully considered in view of all relevant circumstances of the case.

“© Cf. NJA 2010 s. 219. It further follows from a statement by Ohrstrém that the provision entails that the respondent shall be
ordered iwithin a certain time limit to appoint an arbitrator: "After the claimant has appointed an arbitrator, the respondent is
requested to appoint an arbitrator and finally the SCC will appoint a chairman’, see Ohrstrém, Stockholms
Handelskammares skiljedomsinstitut, 2009, p .121.

In this case, such consideration should have led the SCC to set significantly longer
deadlines. Therefore, the deadline of first effectively 15 days from receipt of the Request
for Arbitration and then 9 days was a violation of due process and a violation of the

principle of equality of the Parties.

The relevant circumstances that should have been considered by the SCC in this case are
mainly the following: (i) the case was complex, (ii) the respondent was a sovereign state,
(iii) the arbitration was commenced in breach of the three month cooling-off period, (iv)
several days were needed for delivery of documents, (v) the alleged order was unclear (vi)
English was not readily understood by the respondent, and (vii) an arbitrator can only be
chosen after due consideration and communication. The SCC failed to take these facts

into consideration.

(i) The case was complex

In setting the deadlines for RoK to respond, the SCC should have considered that this
was an extremely complex dispute. This should have been obvious from a first review of

the Request for Arbitration with 40 pages and its 42 exhibits.

(ii) The respondent was a sovereign state

In setting the deadlines, the SCC should also have considered that the respondent was a
sovereign state. It should be common knowledge that every state has an administrative
apparatus that requires certain procedures and routines to be followed. The first would be
the identification of the competent governmental authority. The SCC sent the letter to the
authority indicated by Stati as the “likely’ competent authority. The SCC should therefore
have been warned that it may not be a straightforward task which authority would be
acting for RoK. The question regarding the competent authority would be a matter under
Kazakh law in accordance with Article 48, second para. SAA. Under Kazakh law it could
be different governmental authorities, which could be the competent one in different

arbitral proceedings and finally it is the Prime Minister who decides on such issue.

It should also have been obvious to the SCC that the intra-governmental decision making
process further entails retaining legal counsel. This may be a lengthy process given that
an engagement letter in accordance with national legislation has to be drawn up and often
even a tender process may have to be initiated. In addition, documents need to be
translated into Russian or Kazakh so that they can be understood by the decision makers.
Only then can the answer to be provided including the appointment of an arbitrator be

agreed and developed with legal counsel.

The SCC should not be expecting any government authority to communicate with the
SCC until it has retained legal counsel, legal counsel has studied the Request and

counsel and the government authority have deliberated on how to react.

The fact that states as respondents should be treated differently is widely accepted in
international arbitration, including lawyers from the law firm representing Stati in this case.
King & Spalding lawyers Doak Bishop and Margrete Stevens, the latter being a member
of the SCC board, accepted in an article that

“[mJany who have been involved in investment arbitration will recognize
the delays in the procedural schedule that often occur when a state is
the respondent. Postponements attributable to the burden of organizing
the government machinery is accepted to some extent as par for the
course when arbitrating against a state."°°

(iii) The arbitration was initiated in breach of the provisioned three month cooling-off
period

The Arbitration was requested with a direct reference to Article 26 in ECT. As seen by the
circumstances set out in section 5.2 and in the following, the SCC should, in addition to
taking note of that the cooling-off period was not followed by Stati, at least have prolonged
the response time limit for RoK in order to give him the opportunity to take stance on the
conditions for an arbitration according to the ECT.

(iv) Several days needed for delivery of documents

The SCC should also have been aware and taken into consideration that, even by courier,
it takes a certain time to deliver documents between Sweden and Rok. As the evidence
shows even by courier the delivery took at least four days. Further, the SCC should have
noticed that Stati had only provided it with the name of the Ministry but no further
specification of any person. It therefore had to assume that in addition to the time for the
courier, it would take further time within the Ministry for the competent person to receive
the letter.

(v) The alleged order was unclear

Further, the SCC should at least have seen to it that its letters and instructions would be
understandable by a party that does not yet have legal counsel. When sending on a
request for arbitration, the SCC has to assume that the chances are high that this party
has not yet appointed legal counsel. The instructions given should therefore be readily
understandable and clear to someone who is not well versed in international arbitration.
When SCC received the Request for Arbitration, the starting assumption for SCC must be
that RoK most likely did not have a legal counsel.

The letter from the SCC only refers to an answer to the Request for Arbitration with
reference to Article 5 of the SCC Rules. In accordance with what has been discussed

(103)

under section 5.1.5 above, this order can hardly, even with an indulgent interpretation, be
seen as including a request for whom RoK had appointed as it arbitrator. For a party
without legal counsel it would be almost impossible to interpret, into the order of the SCC,
such a request.

(vi) English not readily understood by respondent

The SCC also failed to take into consideration that English is not a language commonly
spoken in Rok, a fact that was or should have been known by the Secretariat of the SCC.
The official languages in RoK are Kazakh and Russian. In the relevant department of the
Ministry of Justice only two people spoke English at the time. From the exhibits sent with
the Request for Arbitration, the SCC could also have seen that English was never a
language in which the Parties had communicated, it was always Russian.

The Russian version of Article 5 (1)(v) in SCC rules has the following wording in relevant
part: "ecnu 3To npegycmoTpeHo u3z6paHHON npoyeAypon”, translated English meaning, "if
it is provided in the chosen procedure". If the Ministry of Justice had opportunity to
analyze the content of SCC’s request, they would most likely have used the Russian
version of the SCC rules. Since Article 26 ECT does not contain a provision about amount
of the arbitrators, but rather refers to the SCC Rules. Therefore, the SCC’s request in the
letter about that RoK should answer to the Request for Arbitration can hardly be
understood as if it also entailed a requirement of appointing an arbitrator.

(vii) An arbitrator can only be chosen after due consideration and communication

In addition, the SCC should have taken into consideration that in particular in an
investment arbitration, the choice of an arbitrator requires specific care and consideration.
It is common to research which stance potential candidates have taken on disputed issues
in other investment arbitrations. Often, some exchange with potential candidates occurs
before an appointment and this is not only admissible but common practice that requires
additional time.

(viii) | SCC failed to take any of these factors into consideration

The SCC, however, failed to take into account any of these circumstances when setting
the time limits for RoK to provide an answer and to appoint an arbitrator. Rather, even a
respondent that is not a state but an entity in a straightforward commercial arbitration may
have struggled with them.

The effectively 15 days from receipt of the Request for Arbitration are too short a time

period even for domestic Swedish arbitrations. Article 14 (1) of the Swedish Arbitration Act
prescribes a period of 30 days from receipt of the notice of the other party's

25

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 27 of 92

appointment.®' In this case, the SCC thus granted a state in an investment arbitration
about half the time that would have needed to be accorded to a party in a domestic
Swedish commercial arbitration according to the SAA. It is obvious that the time frame
granted to the RoK was insufficient and did not accord with generally accepted standards.

(104) The additional 9 days deadline could not help to heal the fact that the deadline was too
short. Even if both deadlines are combined, it was only a deadline of 30 days from receipt
of the Request for Arbitration. This may be just acceptable for domestic arbitration but it is
incompatible with international investment arbitration.

(105) Disputes under the ICSID Convention are a particularly good measure of established
international practice for arbitrations in which states are involved. The ICSID Convention
thus takes into account the particularities of state parties in international arbitration. It
should also be mentioned that the ECT also provides for the possibility to take recourse to
ICSID as an alternative to the SCC and a state’s right should not be curtailed by the fact
that an investor opts for an SCC arbitration rather than ICSID.

(106) According to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention, there is at least a 90 day time period
after dispatch of the notice of registration of the request before an arbitrator can be
appointed on behalf of one party:

“If the Tribunal shall not have been constituted within 90 days after notice of
registration of the request has been dispatched by the Secretary-General in
accordance with paragraph (3) of Article 36, or such other period as the parties
may agree, the Chairman shall, at the request of either party and after consulting
both parties as far as possible, appoint the arbitrator or arbitrators not yet
appointed (...)”

(107) Such a deadline would take sufficiently into consideration that a state is party to the
arbitration. In this case, where further factors, such as the failure to abide by the cooling-
off period and the high complexity of the case (and eventually a claim for more than USD
3 billion) played a role, the SCC should have considered to afford more time to RoK, not
less.

(108) In addition, the SCC aggravated the situation by providing unclear instructions that, at
least to a party which had not yet retained legal counsel. In its letters, instead of pointing
to the necessary actions, in this case the appointment of an arbitrator, the SCC only
requested RoK to submit an answer to the Request for Arbitration in accordance with
Article 5 of the SCC Rules. The SCC never explicitly mentioned that this Answer was to
include the appointment of an arbitrator. The SCC did not mention that failure in this
respect would lead to the SCC appointing an arbitrator on Rok’s behalf.

*' See Hobér, International Commercial Arbitration in Sweden, 2011, s. 151, 4.18, who writes: “/E]ssentially, under the SCC
Rules, the Board has the same role and function as the District Court has under the SAA".

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 28 of 92

(109) By stating certain issues that the Answer should include but omitting the fact that an
arbitrator should be chosen, the SCC rather created the impression that such an
appointment was not necessary. It is obvious that the SCC should explicitly have
requested RoK to appoint an arbitrator. Celeste E. Salinas Quero, legal counsel at the
SCC, describes the procedure with the following words:

“Upon receipt of the request for arbitration, the counsel in charge of the division
will send the request to the respondent for comment. Respondents are invited to
comment on claims raised, on the number of arbitrators, if called for by the
parties’ arbitration agreement, or other circumstances of the case. If needed.
respondents are also invited to appoint their arbitrator.”** (emphasis added)

(110) Due process requires that a party is given sufficient opportunity to appoint its arbitrator. It
entails a right to be heard as well as the equal treatment of the parties.

(111) In the present case, the SCC, after first having set insufficient time limits, then proceeded
with undue haste to appoint Professor Lebedev on behalf of RoK. The SCC’s haste in
dealing with the appointment is also demonstrated by its appointment of the Chairman
within another 7 days, and without suggesting for the Parties to agree on the appointment
of Chairman, or neither informing them about that SCC intended on appointing a
Chairman (see section 5.1.8 below).

(112) Under normal circumstances, even if the deadline for a party to appoint has elapsed, it will
not find out a mere 5 working days later that its arbitrator has already been appointed by
the institution. At the ICC, for example, such an appointment generally does take a certain
time and if, in the interim a party nominates an arbitrator, the Court may nevertheless
accept this nomination, even though technically made out of time.*°

(113) The haste with which the SCC made the appointment thus intensifies the concerns raised
regarding the length of the deadlines for the response.

(114) Ms. Salinas Quero, counsel at the SCC, has written an article on the SCC’s appointment
process. She describes it as a two-step procedure, where the Secretariat firstly decides
on a list consisting usually of at least three potential arbitrators to be handed over to the
Board. This entails a meeting of the Secretariat in which each counsel presents to their
colleagues and to the Secretary General and Deputy Secretary General the cases that are

to be taken to the Board for appointment and the Secretariat then in a collective decision
making process, agrees on a list of candidates.

(115) It seems unlikely that the appointment process described above could have been
completed in the five working days from the SCC’s receipt of Stati’s request to appoint an
arbitrator on behalf of RoK until the appointment of Professor Lebedev.

(116) Further, in this case the constitution of the full Tribunal was communicated to the Parties
on 28 September 2010, i.e. within 54 days of registration of the request for arbitration
(less than two months). Ms. Salinas Quero of the SCC states in the same article that on
average, the constitution of a tribunal takes no more than three months after registration
of a request for arbitration until communication of the Board’s decision to the parties.
This case should not have been one for the Secretariat to attempt beating the average
time frame. The average time frame might apply to the average domestic case which
represents more than half the cases administered by the SCC. Notably, this average
timeframe of three months also appears to include cases that are subject to expedited
proceedings (Sw. férenklade forfaranden) and which account for more than one third of
the cases at the SCC.*°

(117) It should also be added that in the past, the SCC has treated investment arbitration cases
very differently than it did in this case. In the arbitration A/-Bahloul v Tajikistan, the SCC
sent the Request for Arbitration to the Republic of Tajikistan on 3 June 2008 and when not
receiving a reply from Tajikistan, it appointed an arbitrator on its behalf on 13 August
2008, i.e. 71 days after dispatch of the Request for arbitration rather than 46 days as in
this case.*” It should also be mentioned that the SCC rather than only sending one
reminder, sent three reminders to Tajikistan.°°

(118) The SCC’s actions were also in contradiction to generally acknowledged international
standards, in particular when a state is a party to the arbitration. A survey has shown that
on average it takes 180 days or approximately 6 months from registration of a claim for an
ICSID tribunal to be constituted. This is contrasted by little more than 1.5 months in this
case. Indeed, ICSID will only appoint an arbitrator on behalf of a party if at least 90 days
have passed from dispatch of the notice of registration as mentioned above. In this case,
after only half this time, an arbitrator had already been appointed on behalf of RoK.

(119) The SCC is not a novice either in the administration of investment arbitration cases, nor in
handling cases that involve states that do not have English as an official language. The

SCC should therefore have known and respected the complications arising therefrom.
However, the SCC not only ignored that a state was party to the arbitration, it also
disregarded the complexity of the case with claims running into multi-billion amounts in
USD.

The appointment within such a short time is a violation of due process and the principle of
equality of the Parties for the reasons mentioned above. RoK should have been given a
realistic opportunity to appoint its arbitrator.

Right to a due process should at least require that SCC has put the same effort in
appointment of an arbitrator, as a Party would have done. This obligation can be seen in
Article 13 (6) SCC rules. The short time period that applied in this case shows that SCC
has not even followed its own set of rules.

The SCC did not afford RoK the right to be heard when appointing an arbitrator on
behalf of RoK

The SCC’s appointment of Professor Lebedev as arbitrator on behalf of RoK is a violation
of the SAA, of the fundamental procedural rights and of the SCC’s own general
procedure.

As the timeline demonstrates, RoK received Stati’s request for the appointment of an
arbitrator 3 days after the SCC had already appointed the arbitrator. Thus, RoK was not
given any opportunity to respond to Statis’ request. Further, instead of for instance
presenting RoK with the name of the arbitrator or arbitrators considered for appointment,
the SCC immediately appointed Professor Lebedev.

For cases, in which the District Court acts as appointing authority, Section 14, subsection
3 of the SAA provides that the District Court is obliged to serve the respondent with the
application for the appointment of an arbitrator and to give him the opportunity of
expressing his views on it?

Under the SCC Rules, the Board has the same role and function as the District Court
under the SAA.© Therefore, the SCC is under the same obligation to serve the
respondent with such an application and to provide him with an opportunity to comment
and to react.

In fact, it is not only a question of the SAA but also a question of general procedural
principles that it is necessary to provide a party the opportunity to be heard. The request
to appoint an author on behalf of another party is an important procedural act and it
should be treated accordingly. The SCC chose surprisingly send Stati’s request by
registered post instead of by carrier.

Again, the ICSID Rules are a good measure of what should be observed in such a
situation. Rule 4 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules specifies that the request to appoint an
arbitrator on behalf of one party should be sent to the other party, the ICSID Chairman
shall use his best efforts to comply with this request within 30 days of receipt and before
proceeding to make an appointment he shall consult both parties as far as possible. None
of this occurred here when SCC appointed Professor Lebedev.

These considerations are aggravated by the fact that the SCC entirely failed to warn RoK
that failing an appointment of an arbitrator, the SCC Board would make the appointment.
In fact, the SCC letters did mention certain consequences of not responding to the
Request for Arbitration but failed to mention this particular consequence explicitly. Thus,
only the Claimants’ request to appoint an arbitrator would have informed RoK of this
potential consequence. Being heard on this request thus was of particular importance.

Further, the SCC did not comply with its own routines and practice. When Stati requested
the SCC to appoint an arbitrator on behalf of RoK, the SCC did so without even first letting
RoK receive this request. The latter is particularly improper, given former SCC Deputy
Secretary General Marie Ohrstrém’s statement that

“[ijt is a fundamental principle in the SCC case administration that the
parties should take equal note of all briefs, documents and other
material submitted to the SCC or to the arbitral tribunal.”*'

The SCC’s actions in this case undermined this fundamental principle since it is only
relevant to inform a party about a request from the other party when there is still time to
react to such a request.

The SCC did not afford RoK the right to be heard when appointing the Chairman of
the Tribunal

The Chairman of the Tribunal, Professor Béckstiegel, was appointed by SCC on 27
September 2010, i.e. only within 4 working days from Professor Lebedev’s acceptance of
his appointment by the SCC. Again, RoK was not invited to comment on this appointment.
Even though Stati had already in the Request for Arbitration also asked the SCC for the
opportunity for the parties to jointly appoint the Chairman.

Although, the SCC Board under Article 13(3) of the SCC Rules has the power to appoint
the Chairman of the Tribunal, SCC practice shows that the parties should be invited to
comment on such appointment. The parties are even encouraged to agree on the choice
of the Chairman and even Stati itself had acknowledged the importance of the Parties’
influence on the appointment of the Chairman.

In an arbitration of this magnitude and importance — an investment arbitration including a
state as one of the parties — it is of utmost importance to hear the parties regarding the

choice of the Chairman. In particular, since the Chairman has a very important role within
the Tribunal. In investment arbitrations, where awards are frequently published, it is
common practice that the parties scrutinize the standpoints taken in previous arbitrations
by other arbitrators in issues at hand. This further emphasizes the importance of the
parties’ rights to be heard regarding the choice of the Chairman.

In this case, the SCC disregarded both the importance of the appointment of the
Chairman and Stati’s request by its hasty appointment of Professor Béckstiegel.

The SCC’s violations of fundamental procedural rights of RoK and the Tribunal's
management entail that the arbitral award is invalid, alternatively it should be set
aside

As has been demonstrated above, the SCC has violated fundamental principles and rights
as well as its own rules by (i) failing to conduct a proper prima facie review of the Request
for Arbitration and thus failing to detect that the arbitration was initiated in breach of the
three month cooling-off period, (ii) wrongly assuming that RoK should appointed an
arbitrator with its Answer to the Request for Arbitration, (iii) acting in violation of due
process and the principle of equality of the parties by stipulating deadlines that were too
short, (iv) not affording RoK the right to be heard when appointing an arbitrator on behalf
of Rok, and (v) not affording RoK the right to be heard when appointing the Chairman of
the Tribunal. The Tribunal has later, by its own decision determined that they had
jurisdiction, thus accepting the SCC’s wrongful management of this matter and therefore
committed an error themselves.

In summary, the SCC’s initial management of this case — that culminated in the SCC’s
appointment of Professor Lebedev as an arbitrator, which was later ratified by the
Tribunal, must be depicted as tainted by many unfortunate misjudgments. These
misjudgments have further entailed that Rok’s right to due process and the right to have
the arbitration tried in a manner which considered Rok’s requests in a fair and equitable
way, have been violated.

This beginning of the proceedings has entailed that the subsequent proceedings were
unbalanced, which was further evidenced by the arbitrators’ completely varying
commitment and behavior during the proceedings™. Accordingly, the Award must be
declared invalid in accordance with Section 33 p. 2 in SAA, as being clearly incompatible
with the basic principles of the Swedish legal system.” Alternatively, the Award shall be
set aside in accordance with Section 34 p. 4 in SAA, since the Tribunal has been
appointed in violation of the Parties’ agreement, i.e. the SCC Rules. In any event, the
SCC’s and the Tribunal’s management was an irregularity in the course of the

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 34 of 92

The Award is not covered by a valid arbitration agreement between the Parties
because Stati failed to abide by the three month “cooling-off” period in Article 26
ECT and which constitutes a precondition in RoK’s offer

5.2.1 Introduction

(138)

(139)

(140)

The arbitral proceedings and the award are based on the arbitration agreement
provisioned in Article 26 ECT. Contrary to arbitration agreements between commercial
actors, usually established in connection to the commercial agreement, the provision in
Article 26 ECT does not constitute a fulfilled arbitration agreement. This provision should
instead be counted as a standing offer for an arbitration agreement by the State through
the accession to the ECT. A binding arbitration agreement between the investor and the
State is established first when the investor accepts the standing offer by a request for
arbitration. The State’s consent to arbitral proceedings is therefore based entirely on the
provisions of Article 26 ECT.

Article 26 stipulates that arbitral proceedings must be preceded by a “cooling-off” period of
three months. Following this cooling-off period is therefore a mandatory precondition for
State’s consent and the standing offer per se. In this case, Stati requested arbitration only
five days after RoK had terminated the subsoil contracts. It is therefore obvious that Stati
has failed to adhere to the cooling-off period, and the reason why a valid arbitration
agreement never was established between the Parties. Stati’s failure in this respect has
caused an irreparable prejudice to RoK, a damage that consequently could not be healed
by a stay of arbitral proceedings. RoK protested against this condition and as a
consequence, never waived the right to set forth objections against the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.

The State's obligation through ECT or BIT is considered a grant for the investors, that is
being offered the opportunity to on the prerequisites set in ECT and applicable BIT to
have their disputes resolved in an international arbitration. Otherwise, the investor has to
use authorized District Court where the investor is not obligated to follow provisions about
cooling-off periods or other requirements according to the ECT/bit. Hence, the investor
has a choice to have its claim tried. The investor cannot do cherry-picking, i.e. not to
choose whatever parts of the both alternatives. If the investor chooses to request for
arbitration, he then must accept the conditions and requirements in regards to that
alternative, meaning that an arbitration must be preceded by a cool-off period.

5.2.2 The fulfilment of the three month “cooling off” period was a mandatory condition in

(141)

ROK’s offer to consent to arbitration

Rok’s standing offer to arbitration was conditioned on the prior fulfilment of the three
month “cooling off” period foreseen in Article 26(2) ECT. Article 26(2) ECT provides that a
dispute may only be submitted to arbitration if it cannot be settled amicably within a period
of three months from the date on which either party to the dispute “requested amicable
settlement’.

(145)

The parties’ agreement to arbitration under an international investment treaty is usually
established in two steps: First, the state makes an offer to arbitrate in the investment
treaty in question, usually in a specific dispute resolution clause. Second, the investor
impliedly accepts the offer to arbitrate by initiating arbitration proceedings. In that regard, it
is important to note that dispute resolution clauses in treaties typically provide for a
number of prerequisites, such as the existence of a protected “investment” and “investor”
in the meaning of the treaty and, in many cases, the fulfilment of further requirements
such as a “cooling off” period. If such requirements are not fulfilled, the investor's initiation
of arbitration does not constitute the acceptance of the state’s offer but rather a counter-
offer/new offer with new conditions, namely without the requirements established in the
state's offer. In such situation, consent is not existent and cannot be assumed. Pursuant
to Swedish contract law, such counter-offer cannot entail that a party is bound unless the
counter-offer in turn is accepted by the state. That was not the case.

Presently, the clear wording of ECT Article 26(2), its purpose and scholarly opinion as well
as investment arbitration case law lead to the conclusion that the state’s consent to
arbitration was conditioned on the fulfilment of the “cooling off” period.

The relevant parts of Article 26 ECT read as follows:

“(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of
the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the
former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

 

(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which
either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution: [...]

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting
Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a
dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in_accordance with
the provisions of this Article. [...]

(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for
resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further provide
its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to: [...]

(c) an arbitral proceeding under the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.” (emphasis provided)

The wording of Article 26 ECT is clear. ECT Article 26(1) uses mandatory language,
namely the word “shall” to establish an obligation on the parties to pursue amicable

34

settlement. Moreover, Article 26(3) ECT provides that the offer of consent is given in
accordance with all of the provisions of Article 26ECT, including those of
Article 26(2) ECT. This entails that a state’s consent to arbitrate is dependent on the
fruitless exhaustion of the amicable settlement requirement within the three month period.
It follows therefore that an arbitration agreement will not be concluded unless such an
attempt has taken place.®° Where no notification for amicable settlement has been given
and, moreover, no attempts to settle have been made prior to the investor's attempts to
invoke the dispute resolution mechanisms in Article 26(2)(c) ECT, the state’s standing
offer to arbitrate is not met by an acceptance by the investor. Rather, the investor makes a
counter-offer/new offer with different conditions.

(146) The same conclusion follows if one considers the purpose of the “cooling off” period. This
purpose is threefold: For one, the “cooling off” period aims to ensure amicable rather than
adversarial resolution of disputes.®” This purpose is best achieved if the investor is forced
to request amicable settlement prior to initiating arbitration and to actually pursue
settlement talks within the “cooling off’ period. Consequentially, the “cooling off”
requirement must be understood as a necessary and well-motivated condition to the
state’s consent to arbitration.

(147) Secondly, it is procedurally cost effective to have the parties negotiate in order reach an
amicable solution before the parties commence a costly arbitration. There is a manifest
difference between letting amicable settlement negotiations take place before, instead of
after a possible arbitration has been initiated.

(148) Thirdly, the “cooling off” period also has another, maybe even more important purpose:
The “cooling-off” period allows a respondent state time to understand and grapple with the
issues underlying the threatened claim and permits it the time required to put into motion
the machinery of the state, through the proper channels of government communication,
required to prepare itself to engage in the arbitration. Such additional time period is
essential for respondent states because typically, numerous state bodies need to be
involved in order to assess a claim brought by an investor and it may potentially become
necessary to create working groups in order to coordinate the state’s reaction to a claim.
All of this is very time consuming. The “cooling off” period ensures that there is sufficient
time for the state at the beginning of the case in order to e.g. coordinate and assess the
issues, appoint counsel, formulate an initial reaction and, if the claim should continue to
the stage of arbitration, nominate an arbitrator. In order for this purpose of the “cooling off”
period to be fulfilled, it is essential that the “cooling off” requirement is understood as strict
and jurisdictional.

Only if the state is granted the “cooling off” period at the beginning of the dispute is it
ensured that both parties to the eventual arbitration are on an equal footing. That is
because the investor has all the time in the world to prepare its claim. Equality of the
parties can only be ensured if the state is given additional time by means of the “cooling
off” period at the beginning of the case. On the other hand, watering down the “cooling off”
requirement to a negligible requirement of procedure would entail that an investor could
effectively ignore the “cooling off’ period and start into the dispute with an unfair
advantage.

Further, scholarly opinion has also interpreted Article 26(2) ECT in this manner. Professor
Adnan Amkhan Bayno, the Former Head of Legal Affairs Department of the Energy
Charter Secretariat, has stated that ‘[t]he absence of an attempt to settle the dispute
amicably within the prescribed period can be interpreted as the non-existence of the offer
by a contracting party to arbitrate.” and that as a result, the tribunal will be unable to
decide the dispute for lack of jurisdiction. Importantly, Stati themselves presented an
opinion by Professor Bayno in the Arbitration.°° This opinion covered several issues of
international law but sidestepped in a quite apparent manner the question whether the
“cooling off” requirement is jurisdictional in nature. Professor Bayno thus apparently still
continues to hold his original opinion and could not be convinced by Stati’ counsel to
change his view.

While so far, there has been no Swedish case law dealing with the cooling-off period
under the ECT, investment tribunals dealing with the interpretation of other investment
treaties also confirmed that “cooling off” requirements have to be understood as a
precondition for state consent. This proposition was for example recognised by the
tribunal in Murphy v. Ecuador. The Murphy case described the obligation for a cooling-off
period under the BIT between Ecuador and the USA as constituting “a fundamental
requirement that Claimant must comply with, compulsorily, before submitting a request for
arbitration”.”° Further, the Murphy tribunal held that the “cooling off” requirement ‘is not an
inconsequential procedural requirement but rather a key component of the legal
framework established in the BIT and in many other similar treaties, which aims for the
parties to attempt to amicably settle the disputes that might arise resulting of the
investment made by a person or company of the Contracting Party in the territory of the
another State’.”'

Furthermore, the tribunal in Enron v. Argentina also stated in an obiter dictum that the
“cooling off” requirement in the US-Argentina BIT was “very much a jurisdictional one”.

According to the Enron tribunal, “[a] failure to comply with that requirement would result in
a determination of lack of jurisdiction.””*

Christer Sdderlund, a Swedish lawyer with extensive experience from international
arbitration in general and investment arbitration in particular, has voiced strong support for
the finding of the Enron tribunal:

“My own view on this issue corresponds to what the Tribunal in the
Enron-case stated in the aforementioned part. With respect to
procedural issues, which arise in connection with the application of a
dispute resolution clause, it cannot be eligible to let practical views or
general considerations of the purpose to be decisive. Needless to say,
a Tribunal may not deviate from the parties’ agreement as to the rules
for the proceedings, even if — which, in practice, is rather frequently
the case — very strong judicial economy-reasons would speak in favor
of such measures. A Tribunal (or indeed a court), which faces the
objection that a certain described preamp in a dispute resolution
clause has not been fulfilled, must thus adjudicate this issue and, if
this is considered to be the case, dismiss the request for arbitration. 73

Notably, the interpretation of conditions to the state’s consent to arbitrate also plays a
large role in case of so-called “local remedies” requirements in international investment
treaties. Such requirements differ from the “cooling off” requirement in Article 26(2) ECT in
that they require no settlement negotiations but instead an attempt to litigate the dispute in
the local courts of the host state for a certain period of time prior to submitting it to
arbitration (typically between six and eighteen months). Considering the legal relevance,
these “local remedies” requirements are to some extent comparable to the “cooling off”
requirement, given that the “local remedies” requirements also describe the various
necessary steps in the process of settlement of the dispute. With regard to these “local
remedies” requirements, there is a strong precedent establishing that these impose a
precondition on the state’s consent to arbitrate and are jurisdictional in nature. For
example, the tribunal in /CS v. Argentina argued that “local remedies” requirements
imposed conditions on state consent and were therefore jurisdictional in nature. “ The
same view was also taken by arbitrator Christopher Thomas in his opinion in the case of
Hochtief v. Argentina.”> This precedent can be applied to the present case by way of
analogy.

As an example, the Tribunal in ICS v. Argentina, also stated that the requirement of “local
remedies” includes the preconditions for a State's consent to an arbitration proceeding
and therefore affects the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Same opinion was expressed by the
arbitrator Christopher Thomas in the dispute Hochtief v. Argentina. These guiding cases
can be applied in this dispute and further supports the requirement of the cooling-off
period provisioned in Article 26 (2) ECT being applied strictly and that it has a connection
with the Parties consent to an arbitration.

As a point of interest, it should also be mentioned that Stati seem to have acknowledged
that the fulfilment of the “cooling-off” requirement was a precondition for the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal. Otherwise, they would not already in their Request for Arbitration have tried
to argue that they complied with this requirement.”° While their arguments were incorrect,
they are nonetheless telling in that they show that Stati were aware of their problem with
the “cooling off” requirement from early on.

Stati’s commenced arbitral proceedings without going through with the mandatory
three month “cooling-off” period foreseen in Article 26(2) ECT

Contrary to Article 26(2) ECT, Stati failed entirely to request amicable settlement prior to
initiating the arbitration. Instead of requesting amicable settlement and going through with
the three month “cooling-off” period after the contract termination on 21 July 2010, Stati
simply commenced arbitration within a mere five days by way of submitting their Request
for Arbitration on 26 July 2010.

During the arbitration, Stati suggested that they had fulfilled the “cooling-off” requirement
by way of two letters sent already in the spring of 2009.” In fact, however, neither of these
letters could be understood as a request for amicable settlement within the meaning of
Article 26(2) ECT. Hence, these letters are irrelevant.

For one, Stati referred to a letter sent by TNG and Terra Raf to the Kazakh Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources (“MEMR”) on 18 March 2009, i.e. 15 months before the
first relevant agreement had been terminated on 21 July 2010. In this letter, TNG and
Terra Raf complained about the MEMP’s position with regard to the transfer of shares
from Gheso to Terra Raf. The letter concludes with the suggestion that the state should
either give up its position, or pay USD 1.347 billion to Terra Raf, or, if neither of the two
other suggestions was to be accepted, “submit the litigation for examination and
settlement to the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce in Sweden,
without terminating or suspending the subsoil use contracts with ‘Tolkynneftegas’ LLP’.”®

It is beyond clear that this letter does not contain a request for amicable settlement within
the meaning of Article 26(2) ECT. No reference to Article 26 ECT or to any other Article of
the ECT is made. The word “amicable” or any of its synonyms do not appear in the letter.

Moreover, the mere fact that SCC arbitration is mentioned contradicts Stati’s position.
Arbitration is a means of adversarial, not of amicable dispute resolution. Suggesting
arbitration is hence the precise opposite of a request for amicable resolution of the
dispute. In any event, the state could not reasonably understand the reference to SCC
arbitration to mean that Stati were considering investment arbitration under the ECT at the
time (March 2009). That is because TNG’s subsoil use contracts also provided for
arbitration as a means of settlement. Against this background, the state had to understand
the reference to SCC arbitration only to be one to the contractually agreed arbitration
mechanism, not to investment arbitration under the ECT.

(161) Stati's reference to Ascom’s letter to Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev dated
7 May 2009 does not support Stati’s position either. In this letter, Ascom threatened that “if
neither the competent authorities nor the law enforcement or judicial bodies take any
action whatsoever against these misdeeds of the controlling bodies, we will have no other
choice but to apply to the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce,
Sweden, or another international arbitration court.””° Again, this cannot be understood as
a request for amicable settlement within the meaning of Article 26(2) ECT. No reference to
the ECT was made and the word “amicable” or its synonyms were not used. Rather, the
letter contains an announcement that adversarial dispute resolution would be pursued, i.e.
the opposite of a request for amicable resolution of the dispute. The reference to
arbitration could not be understood to be a reference to investment arbitration under the
ECT as, again, arbitration was also foreseen in KPM’s and TNG’s subsoil use contracts.

(162) Rok’s position with regard to these two letters is also vindicated by the Decision on
Jurisdiction rendered in the case of Burlington v. Ecuador. In this case, the tribunal found
that the “cooling off’ provision in the bilateral investment treaty between the USA and
Ecuador (the “US-Ecuador BIT”) “requires the investor to inform the host State that it faces
allegations of Treaty breach which could eventually engage the host State's international
responsibility before an international tribunal.*° This finding demonstrates that a clear
reference to an alleged treaty breach is necessary in order to give notice of a dispute.
Notably, Article 26(2) ECT goes even further than the US-Ecuador BIT, in that it requires a
formal request for amicable settlement, not only a notice of the dispute pointing out the
alleged treaty breach.

(163) What is more, both letters are dated and sent out more than a year and a year and a half,
respectively, before the subsoil use contracts with KPM and TNG was terminated and the
arbitration was commence. In principal, the letters also referred to a majority of the events
which predate the circumstances relied on by Stati in the arbitration. This is a further
reason why they cannot be understood as a request for amicable settlement with regard
to the present dispute.

Finally and in any event, it should be noted that the letters only referred to Terra Raf and
and Ascom, which also is a fact illustrating that the letters did not mean a request of
cooling-off negotiatitons. Furthermore, even though you were to accept Stati’s agreement
that these letters implied a request for an amicable settlement, the letters would only cover
Terra Raf and Ascom, and not Anatoli and Gabriel Stati who were the other two claimants
in the dispute. The Tribunal did then have no jurisdiction regarding Antaoli Stati and
Gabriel Stati since they have not respected the cooling-off period in ECT and there were
no valid arbitration agreement with them.

The failure to abide by the “cooling-off” period caused prejudice to RoK that was
not remedied by a later stay of proceedings

Importantly, Stati’ failure to abide by the “cooling off” period was not “healed” by a later
stay of proceedings. While it is correct that such stay occurred, it did not remedy the initial
failure to abide by the “cooling-off” requirement.

The relevant facts with regard to this later stay are the following: On 22 February 2011,
the Tribunal, in consultation with the Parties, created a revised timetable and moved the
various steps of the proceedings to later dates in order to make room for the three month
“cooling-off’ period. On 10 March 2011, the Parties met in London for settlement
negotiations. On 14 May 2011, Stati informed the Tribunal that no settlement had been
reached during the suspension period. Thereafter, the arbitral proceedings continued, i.e.
written submissions were made and hearings were held.

The stay of proceedings during the arbitration could not heal the failure to abide by the
“cooling-off” requirement both as a matter of logic and with a view to the purpose of the
“cooling-off” requirement. Logically, the later stay was irrelevant because there is no state
consent to arbitration if the “cooling-off” period has not been fulfilled prior to the initiation
to arbitration. State consent to arbitration cannot simply be moved to a later stay in the
proceedings. Rather, ROK’s consent had been lacking from the beginning and continued
to lack after the stay of proceedings, which were executed on the Tribunal’s initiative.

The purpose of the “cooling-off” requirement could not be fulfilled by means of the later
stay of proceedings. As outlined above, the “cooling-off” requirement not only aims to
ensure the amicable settlement of disputes but also serves as an additional timeframe for
the state to understand and grapple with the issues underlying the threatened claim and to
put into motion the machinery of the state. Without such additional timeframe at the
beginning of the dispute, the state is put on an unequal footing, in that it has limited time
to analyse the claim, to appoint counsel and especially to consider its choice of arbitrator.
A later stay of proceedings does not help at all when it comes to these potential
disadvantages, so that it cannot play a role for the issue of state consent.

This argument is in fact well illustrated by the present case. Because of Stati’ conscious

decision to ignore the “cooling-off” requirement, and because of the SCC’s unreasonably
hasty decision to appoint Professor Lebedev as arbitrator, RoK was deprived of its right to

(175)

appoint an arbitrator and to file an answer to Stati’ Request for Arbitration, which entailed
significant negative consequences for RoK, and could not be remedied by the later
“cooling-off” period (see section 5.2.6 below).

Moreover, even if one only takes into account the purpose of providing a timeframe for
settlement, a later stay does not equal a stay at the beginning. As outlined above, an early
stay serves procedural economy in that it can ensure a resolution of the dispute at little
cost (see also sections 1.5.1 and 1.7.1 above). Hence, in order to force investors to allow
such cost effective resolution of the dispute, a later stay cannot be accepted as a means
of fulfilling the “cooling-off” requirement.

RoK has never waived its jurisdictional objection

In the course of the arbitration, Stati suggested that RoK had waived its jurisdictional
objection since it engaged in discussions about the stay of proceedings and ultimately
agreed to the stay of proceedings. This argument is incorrect.

Before addressing the Stati’s argument in detail, the following facts shall serve as a
general background to the issue.

On 18 January 2011, RoK requested a three month stay for amicable settlement
discussions with Stati and asked the Tribunal to order Stati to engage in such
discussions.®*’ On 24 January 2011, Stati informed RoK and the Tribunal that they would
be prepared to agree to a sixty day extension, provided that several conditions are
fulfilled.°* One of these conditions was that RoK formally withdraws and waives its
objection regarding the notice period.** Stati never complied with this condition of Stati
and never formally waived its objection regarding the Tribunal's jurisdiction.

On 2 February 2011, Stati agreed to a 90 day suspension which they proposed should
last from 2 February 2011 to 3 May 2011. They also asked RoK for potential dates for
settlement discussions in Paris or London.**

In the following, the parties negotiated regarding the necessary amendments to the
procedural timetable. On 16 February 2011, a joint proposal for an amended timetable
was submitted to the Tribunal.® Subsequently, and as mentioned above, on
22 February 2011, the Tribunal, in agreement with the parties, issued a revised timetable
which provided for the three month stay of proceedings.**

Stati’s argument that RoK waived its jurisdictional objection is based on the wilful
misconstruction of one statement made by Rok in the above mentioned correspondence.
This statement is contained in Rok’s letter dated 18 January 2011 and reads:

“(W]e propose that the Tribunal order Claimants to engage in amicable
settlement discussions as required by Article 26 of the ECT, and that the
proceedings be suspended during the three- months period in satisfaction
of that jurisdictional requirement. We offer this as a practical solution that
best serves the interests of the parties notwithstanding the fact that this
jurisdictional defect could result in dismissal after full briefing and hearing
on the merits.”

According to Stati, this statement was to mean that RoK considered the belated three
month stay to satisfy the “cooling-off” requirement. However, this understanding is in clear
disregard of the second sentence of the above quote where it is stated that ROK’s
jurisdictional objection remained, even if the proceedings were to continue with a hearing
on the merits, unless the parties reached an amicable settlement.

In fact, at the time, this was also clear to Stati. As is evidenced by their response on
24 January 2011, Stati requested as a precondition for their consent to a stay that RoK
formally withdraws and waives its objection regarding the notice period. If Stati had
already understood the Rok’s letter dated 18 January 2011 to contain such waiver, they
would not have needed to request a further waiver in their response.

In point of fact, the matter is quite simple: RoK requested a stay of proceedings. Stati then
offered a stay of proceedings but also requested RoK to waive its jurisdictional objection.
In the following, RoK did not do so, whereupon Stati agreed to the stay anyway. Against
this background, any argument that RoK waived its jurisdictional objection is based on
wishful thinking rather than the actual facts of the case.

The Tribunal failed to correctly decide the matter

In the Award, the Tribunal failed almost entirely to properly adjudicate the matter of the
“cooling-off” period. In a cursory manner, the Tribunal concluded that the “cooling off”
period was procedural rather than jurisdictional in nature, “at least as long as the Parties
have indeed had such a three months opportunity.” The decision whether the “cooling
off” requirement is regulated by the arbitral agreement between the parties; in this case
Article 26(2) ECT, which clearly states that this is a first step before a subsequent
arbitration and constitute an express condition to the offer made by the state to consent to
arbitration. There can be no doubt that this is a matter of jurisdiction if this condition has
not been satisfied. It can neither depend on later factual circumstances such as whether
the parties had the “three months opportunity” or not, unless the parties have concluded
an express agreement to waive the requirement for a “cooling off” period.

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 44 of 92

(181) The further conclusions of the Tribunal were equally incorrect and underdeveloped.
According to the Tribunal, given the purpose of the “cooling off” period and the fact that
settlement discussions were held during the stay of proceedings, no prejudice to either
party was caused so that there is no reason to deny jurisdiction. This conclusion is in
clear disregard of the massive prejudice caused to RoK because RoK was deprived of its
right to appoint its own arbitrator which in fact was caused in part by the disregarded 3
months cooling-off period. In any event, it is unclear how prejudice would relate to the
question of jurisdiction, i.e. the question of whether the state consented to arbitration.

(182) Considering the SCC’s experience and knowledge about the ECT in general and
Article 26(2) ECT in particular requiring a three month cooling off period prior to the
initiation of arbitration, the SCC and its Secretariat should have had no difficulties to
establish that this mandatory requirement had not been met by Stati when they submitted
their Request for Arbitration. The two letters attached to the request for arbitration rather
confirmed that the requirement had not been satisfied. Hence, the SCC should have
established within the framework of its prima facie consideration (Articles 9 (i), 10 (i) SCC
Rules) that the case should have been. As it would have turned out, this would also have
resolved the problem with the appointment of an arbitrator by ROK.

(183) In light of these clear mistakes committed by the Tribunal, and in light of the above
mentioned legal considerations regarding the “cooling off” period, there can be no other

conclusion than that the Award needs to be set aside according to Section 34 p. 1 of the
SAA because it is not covered by a valid arbitration agreement between the parties.

The Award is not covered by a valid arbitration agreement between RoK and Terra
Raf

The Award needs to be set aside partially under Section 34 No. 1 SAA insofar as it
pertains to Terra Raf. The need to set the Award aside arises from the fact that RoK never
consented to arbitration in this dispute with Terra Raf. Terra Raf is no investor according
the Article 1(7) ECT. This follows from the fact that Terra Raf is incorporated in Gibraltar
that does not fall within the scope of ECT. Terra Raf is hence not “organized in
accordance with the law applicable in [a] Contracting Party” of the ECT, as is required by
Article 1(7) ECT. Consequentially, the preconditions for state consent to arbitration under
Article 26 ECT are not fulfilled.

In the following, we intend to submit background information as to the status of the EU
and of Gibraltar in the framework of the ECT. Thereafter, we will state briefly how the
issue was presented by the parties and decided by the Tribunal. In substance, we will
show that the Gibraltar is not included in the scope of ECT by way of the EU's ratification
of the ECT and even if that was the case, Terra Raf is not an investor according to ECT.
Lastly, we will demonstrate that the ECT also does not apply to Gibraltar by way of the
United Kingdom’s signature of the ECT.

The EU and Gibraltar in the framework of the ECT

The ECT is a so-called “mixed agreement”. This means that the ECT was not only signed
and ratified by the United Kingdom and other EU member states but also by the EU itself.
Mixed agreements by both the EU and its member states are concluded where under the
EU treaties, neither the EU nor the member states have the sole competence for all
matters covered by the treaty. The mixed agreements are necessary where neither the EU
nor the member states may act alone when it comes to ratifying the treaty in question.

Gibraltar is a British Overseas Territory. In 1994, the United Kingdom signed the ECT
without ratifying it yet. According to Article 45(1) ECT, signature of the ECT was to lead to
its provisional application pending ratification. When signing the ECT, the United Kingdom
stated that provisional application of the ECT until ratification would extend to United
Kingdom and Northern Ireland, and in Gibraltar’.°* When the United Kingdom ratified the
ECT in 1996, the ratification expressly covered the United Kingdom, Jersey and the Isle of
Man. No mention was made of Gibraltar.

Procedural history and decision by the Tribunal

During the Arbitration, RoK objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction with regard to Terra Raf
based on the argument that Terra Raf is no investor under Article 1(7) ECT. As Terra Raf
was incorporated in Gibraltar and the ECT did not apply to Gibraltar, Terra Raf was no
“company [...] organized in accordance with the law applicable in [a] Contracting Party” in
the meaning of Article 1(7)(a)(ii) ECT.

Stati replied with two separate arguments, namely that the ECT applied to Gibraltar
provisionally by virtue of the United Kingdom’s declaration upon signature of the ECT and
that the ECT applied by virtue of the EU's ratification of the ECT.

Rok rejected both suggestions. To that end, RoK provided an expert opinion by
Professor Tietje, a renowned German scholar with extensive knowledge about both
matters of international investment law and European law. Professor Tietje explained in
detail why in particular Stati’s reference to the EU’s ratification of the ECT was wrong. In
short, it was Professor Tietje’s view that the ECT was ratified by the EU in the framework
of the so-called Common Commercial Policy (CCP). The CCP, however, does not apply to
Gibraltar, meaning that any EU act in the framework of the CCP, such as the ratification of
the ECT, cannot apply to Gibraltar either.

In the Award, the Tribunal dealt with the matter in an extremely simplified manner without
looking into the detailed arguments provided by RoK and Professor Tietje. The Tribunal
held that it had jurisdiction over the claims made by Terra Raf, arguing that “the ECT
applies to Gibraltar on the basis that Gibraltar is a part of the European Community, which
is itself party to the ECT. According to Art. 52 of the Treaty on the European Union and
Art. 355 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Gibraltar is included in its
territory.”° No further arguments were stated and in particular, no response to RoK’s and
Professor Tietje’s remarks regarding the non-application of the CCP to Gibraltar was
given. The CCP was not even mentioned at all.

Notably, the Tribunal did not determine whether the ECT applies to Gibraltar by means of
the United Kingdom’s signature, with the conclusion that such decision was not
necessary.*"

The ECT does not apply to Gibraltar by way of the EU’s ratification of the ECT

The Tribunal’s decision to rely on the EU's ratification of the ECT was wrong. The ECT
does not apply to Gibraltar by way of the EU’s ratification of the ECT. This follows from the
EU's lack of competence for entering into the ECT with effect for Gibraltar.

In the framework of the EU, Gibraltar has a particular status. On the one hand,
Article 355(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) provides
that the TFEU and the EU Treaty “shall apply to the European territories for whose
external relations a Member State is responsible.” Declaration 55 to the Final Act of the
Lisbon Treaty affirms that Gibraltar is recognised under Article 355(3) TFEU. This is what
the Tribunal relied on.

On the other hand, in the United Kingdom’s act of accession to the European
Communities (EC) in 1972, provisions were included in order to address the special
character of Gibraltar as part of the EC. This was because the specific economic and

(197)

political relations of Gibraltar made the complete application of the EC Treaty to Gibraltar
impossible.* One of the provisions in the United Kingdom's act of accession foresees that
Gibraltar will not take part in the CCP of the EC (now EU).”* The fact that Gibraltar does
not take part in the CCP, but rather, that it has the status of third country in that regard,
was affirmed in the year of 2003 by the ECJ in the case C/30/01 Commission v. United
Kingdom. Therein, the ECJ stated that

‘tlhe exclusion of Gibraltar from the customs territory of the
Community by virtue of the Act of Accession of the Kingdom of
Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland implies that neither the Treaty rules on free
movement of goods nor the rules of secondary Community legislation
intended, as regards free circulation of goods, to ensure
approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of
the Member States pursuant to Articles 94 EC and 95 EC are
applicable to it.’**

Gibraltar’s non-participation in the CCP is entirely decisive in the present case. Because
of the CCP not applying to Gibraltar, the EU did not have the competence to ratify the
ECT for Gibraltar, this because the EU’s competences with regard to the ECT fall squarely
within the framework of the CCP. In particular, the EU’s competence to enter into
investment treaties, as established by the Treaty of Lisbon and now contained in
Article 207(1) TFEU, is part of the EU’s competences under the CCP.

The EU's lack of competence for ratifying the ECT for Gibraltar in turn leads to that the EU
has not validly ratified the ECT for Gibraltar. In that regard, Article 29 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) is of particular significance. This provision
states that ‘fujnless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise
established, a treaty is binding upon each party in respect of its entire territory.” The
concept “territory” in the meaning of this provision shall be determined based on the
constitutional law of the state or international organisation concerned. Hence, the founding
treaties of the EU, but also the acts of accession for the various member states must be
taken into account when it comes to determining the territory of the EU. As set out above,
according to the United Kingdom's accession agreement, the EU's territory does not
encompass Gibraltar in matters regarding the CCP. Hence, the EU's ratification of the

ECT forms no basis for assuming that the ECT applies to Gibraltar and that Terra Raf
therefore is a protected investor under Article 1(7) ECT. Hence, there is no state consent
to arbitration against Terra Raf.

5.3.4 Even if the ECT applied to Gibraltar by way of the EU’s ratification, this would still
not mean that Terra Raf were an investor

(198) Alternatively and at irrespective of the EU’s competences in this matter, the conclusion
would be the same through an application of the Article 1(7)(a)(ii) ECT itself. This
provision provides that investors are companies “organized in accordance with the law
applicable in that Contracting Party”. If one were to consequently rely on the EU's
ratification of the ECT, this would require that Terra Raf were organised in accordance
with the law in force in the EU, i.e. with original EU law. In other words, Terra Raf would
have to be a Societas Europaea (SE) or have another company form originating in EU law
itself. This is however not the case as Terra Raf is organised under Gibraltar law. Hence,
Terra Raf can again not be a protected investor under Article 1(7) ECT.

5.3.5 The ECT does not apply to Gibraltar by way of the United Kingdom’s signature
under the ECT

(199) While the Tribunal refrained from discussing the matter, it should be noted that there is
also no alternative way to construct state consent to arbitration by relying on the United
Kingdom’s signature under the ECT in 1994. This signature no longer entails provisional
application of the ECT to Gibraltar because provisional application for Gibraltar ended with
the United Kingdom’s ratification of the ECT in 1996.

(200) As stated above, the United Kingdom initially signed the ECT on 17 December 1994,
stating on the occasion that provisional application would extend to “United Kingdom and
Northern Ireland, and in Gibraltar’. In December 1996, the United Kingdom ratified the
ECT, stating that the ratification covered the United Kingdom as such as well as Jersey
and the Isle of Man. No mention was made of Gibraltar.°” It was clear that it was the
intention of the United Kingdom upon ratifying the ECT to have the provisional application
for Gibraltar end. This was the reason why Gibraltar was not mentioned in the ratification.
This clear intention is confirmed by a note verbale dated 27 July 2004 filed by the United
Kingdom with the Government of Portugal, which is the depositary for the ECT. This note
verbale stated the following:

"The United Kingdom did apply the Energy Charter Treaty
provisionally to the United Kingdom and Gibraltar at signature.
However, the Government of Gibraltar subsequently informed Her
Majesty's Government that they did not wish to seek ratification of the
Treaty, since at that time the Treaty would not have had any practical
effect for the territory. Gibraltar was therefore not included in the

United Kingdom's instrument of ratification relating to the Treaty,
deposited on 17 December 1997.'*°

(201) Therefore it is clear that at the time, Gibraltar did not want the United Kingdom to ratify the
ECT on Gibraltar’s behalf and that therefore, the United Kingdom deliberately did not
include Gibraltar in the ratification document. Consequentially, provisional application
ended with the United Kingdom's ratification.

(202) Rok is of course aware that a challenge to an arbitral award with view to the application of
the ECT to Gibraltar was brought to the Court before, namely in Case No. T 5208-05
(Republic of Kyrgyzstan v. Petrobart Ltd.). However, the present challenge goes far
beyond the facts and legal arguments pleaded by the Parties in the Petrobart case. In
particular, the EU’s ratification of the ECT was not invoked by the parties in the Petrobart
case and had not been referred to by the tribunal in that case either. Moreover, it appears
that the United Kingdom’s note verbale had equally not been invoked in the Petrobart
case. Hence, the Petrobart case does not serve as useful guidance for deciding on the
challenge brought forward in the present case.

(203) As seen by the stated above, the Tribunal has lacked jurisdiction to try the case between
Terra Raf and RoK. This is because RoK never consented to arbitration with Terra Raf, as

a company seated in Gibraltar. The arbitral award shall therefore be set aside in
accordance with Section 34 (1) in SAA, in parts regarding Terra Raf.

The Tribunal failed to consider pivotal witness evidence regarding the quantum of
the LPG Plant

The Tribunal ignored the submission of material witness evidence regarding the LPG
Plant. In awarding damages for this plant, the Tribunal solely relied on allegations which
Stati had made rather in passing and later dropped and which had clearly been rebutted
by witness evidence submitted by RoK. The Tribunal, however, failed to even notice that
this witness, Mr. Khalelov, had testified at the Hearing on Quantum.

The Parties’ positions

One of the four assets for which the Tribunal granted Stati compensation is an unfinished
LPG Plant. It is a plant for processing natural gas which Stati had started constructing in
2006. Stati halted the construction sometime in the first half of 2009 with the construction
being about 90% finished according to their own statements.

Both Parties submitted differing valuations of the LPG Plant. RoK’s experts had assumed
a negative value for the construction based on the assumption that due to a lack of
secured supply of gas for the next years, even if the construction of the LPG Plant were
finalised, it could only be operated for four years until it would need to be shut down. RoK
further argued that the LPG Plant had been a failed project with costs exceeding the
anticipated budget manifold. It assumed that it would not be commercial to finalise the
construction and that the Plant would therefore only have scrap value, which Stati had
failed to quantify.°°

Stati on the other hand had propagated that the LPG Plant would be completed and
operated as a going concern. They therefore ultimately demanded compensation for the
alleged investment costs of USD 245 million and a portion of the so-called prospective
value of USD 329 million, "° assuming that sufficient amounts of gas would be available,
in particular relying on gas from the Contract No. 302 properties. '"" In one of their 6
submissions, with reference to two hyperlinks to internet pages mentioned by their experts
FTI in a footnote that were not even provided as exhibits or translated, Stati had
supported their position that the LPG Plant was not scrap by alleging that publicly
available information indicated that RoK was "gearing up” to open the LPG Plant in 2012
and that it was clear that RoK had already been in the process of spending additional
capital to complete the LPG Plant since its "seizure”.'°? RoK rebutted this allegation in its

*°° At different phases of the arbitration, these claims fluctuated significantly, the investment value was initially asserted to be

area was disputed but even the Defendants considered it this chance to be less than 10%, not even taking into account
whether it would be economically viable to extract them.

Rejoinder on Quantum and submitted a witness statement by Mr. Taras Khalelov.'° Mr.
Khalelov works for KazMunaiTeniz (KMT), the company which operated most of the
Defendant's assets in trust management after their subsoil use contracts had been
terminated and which had also been given the mandate to protect the unfinished LPG
Plant construction (which was not part of the trust management). In his witness statement,
Mr. Khalelov explicitly stated the following:

“The LPG Plant is not part of the trust management. However, as it has
been abandoned by the owners, we protect the premises and the
equipment by employing guards. Ever since the unfinished LPG Plant
was abandoned, no further work has been conducted on the Plant.

| have been informed that Claimants allege that Kazakhstan is training
specialists for the operation of the LPG plant. However, no such training
has taken place and | have never heard about any programme to this
objective either. In addition, | do not know of any intention to finish the
construction of the plant. As our lawyers told us, we are not entitled to
incur any expenses for the plant or to make investments into the plant in
any form because the plant neither belongs to KMT nor to KMG NC.”

(208) In addition, during his testimony, Mr. Khalelov reiterated that no construction had been
conducted by Rok:

“Q: You state in your witness statement, at paragraph 4.1 to be specific,
that: "Ever since the Claimants abandoned the unfinished LPG Plant, no
further construction on the Plant has been conducted." Is that correct?

A. Absolutely correct.

Q. And has any construction been commenced since you submitted your
witness statement? (...)

A. No. The answer to your question is no. (...)
Q. Thank you. And are you aware of any plans to finish the construction?
04

A. No, officially | am not informed of any. | do not know.

(209) Stati failed to cross-examine Mr. Khalelov on this issue. Importantly, Stati did not repeat
the allegation that RoK had spent any capital to complete the LPG Plant in their further
written submissions. Instead Stati did bring forward some other arguments as to why the
LPG Plant had more than scrap value, because Rok’s cost calculations for the completion
was high, and there were enough gas resources and because the insecurity of the gas

resource in any circumstance were not to the detriment for Stati but for RoK who was the
alleged guilty Party.’

The Tribunal’s failure to recognise the submission of pivotal witness evidence

The Tribunal rejected Rok’s position that the LPG Plant would only have scrap value.
Rather than awarding USD 0, the Tribunal awarded USD 199 million for the unfinished
LPG Plant based on an indicative offer by KMG EP. In arriving at this conclusion, the
Tribunal did not look at whether sufficient amounts of gas would be available, which was
the focus of the Parties’ discussions and which was the crucial question according to the
experts of both sides. Rather, the Tribunal did not address RoK’s arguments assuming
that RoK itself had continued the construction of the LPG Plant after Stati had left the
country. It stated the following:

“The Tribunal is not persuaded by Respondent's and their experts’
conclusion that the LPG Plant is a failed project and must be considered
to have a negative value and no damages at all can be claimed by
Claimants. If that were so, Respondent would not have been ready to
invest further expenses in the completion of the Plant, after Respondent
had taken control of the Plant. However, there were obviously plans to
complete it. Publicly available information indicates that Respondent was
in fact preparing to open the LPG Plant in 2012.""°

The Tribunal based this conclusion on two hyperlinks mentioned in a footnote by Stati’s
experts FTI, namely to the webpage for the Mangystau region of the Kazakh embassy in
Israel, which were never submitted as documents and which were never translated.
Procedural Order No. 1, which was the result of the Parties’ first procedural meeting,
stipulated that “all document (...) considered relevant by the Parties shall be submitted
with their Briefs (...)”. It further stipulated that these would need to be submitted as pdf
and in hardcopy. Stati had done neither of the two and had therefore obviously not
considered these relevant. The Tribunal ignored this.

What is more, in arriving at its conclusion the Tribunal did not refer to the written witness
statement or the oral testimony of a witness which RoK had presented, Mr. Taras
Khalelov, even though he had made statements precisely on the issue cited above.

The Tribunal not only failed to consider this written witness's statement and testimony. As
is obvious from the Award, the Tribunal even failed to note that Mr. Khalelov had testified
at the Hearing on Quantum: When describing the witnesses who testified on Day 2 of the
Hearing on Quantum, the Tribunal mentioned all witnesses who testified on that day
except for one. It mentioned that it heard testimony from Mr. Victor Romanosov, Mr.
Catalin Broscaru, Mr. Alexandru Cojin, Mr. Anatolie Stati, and Mr. Nurlan Rahimgaliev.

However, the Tribunal failed to mention one witness who also testified on that day: Mr.
Taras Khalelov.'°”

The Tribunal thus in one single paragraph decided that the LPG Plant had a positive
value, completely ignoring the relevant arguments advanced by both Parties, namely the
further costs to finalise the plant and the availability of gas to be processed in the LPG
Plant. Instead, the Tribunal chose to rely on an argument that had been clearly rebutted
by Rok’s witness and which even Stati had advanced but then dropped in their further
written submissions once it had been rebutted.

The arbitral award shall be set aside in accordance with 34 (1) item 6 of the Swedish
Arbitration Act

In deciding to award Stati USD 199 million in damages for the unfinished LPG Plant
without considering Mr. Khalelov’s evidence", the Tribunal has committed a procedural
mistake.

The Tribunal decided that the LPG Plant had a positive value with one single argument,
namely that RoK had prepared the opening of the plant.'° It thus ignored all arguments
advanced by the Parties and narrowed a complex and much discussed question of
whether the LPG Plant would have been a going concern down to one issue, namely
whether RoK had had plans to finalise the LPG Plant and had started to realise these
plans. It is RoK’s position that the Tribunal clearly did not at all consider Mr. Khalelov’s
evidence. The Tribunal seems to have forgotten that this evidence was submitted and
presented.

This is evidenced by the fact that the Tribunal failed to consider Mr. Khalelov's written
witness statement and testimony in this context even though it addressed the allegation
that RoK had continued to construct the LPG Plant. This is further evidenced by the fact
that even in its summary of Rok’s position regarding the quantum of the LPG Plant, the
Tribunal failed to mention Mr. Khalelov by name. Finally, in its description of the Hearing
on Quantum, the Tribunal lists all witnesses who testified, except for Mr. Khalelov.

The Tribunal’s failure to take note of Mr. Khalelov’s witness statement and testimony is a
procedural mistake within the meaning of section 34 item 6 of the SAA. The Tribunal's
failure to take note of Mr. Khalelov'’s witness statement and testimony has probably
influenced the outcome of the case.

regarding almost every major disputed issue of the case

 

Introduction

The Tribunal has failed to take note of the expert evidence and other evidence that had
been submitted by RoK regarding almost every disputed issue and it has thus committed
very serious procedural mistakes, each by themselves constituting a reason for setting
aside the award. In some instances, the Tribunal also exceeded its mandate. For each
and every reason stipulated below, and independent of each other, the award shall be set
aside pursuant to section 34 SAA, p.2 and p.6.

The Tribunal failed to recognize (i) the submission of expert reports by Professor Didenko
and Mr. Latifov and witness evidence from Mr. Baymaganbetov regarding the
classification of pipelines, (ii) the submission of an expert report by Professor Ilyassova
regarding the legality of the so called pre-emptive rights waiver, (iii) the submission of an
expert report by Professor Balco and witness evidence by Mr. Rahimgaliev regarding the
legality of the back tax assessment, (iv) crucial parts of the report by Rok’s valuation
experts Deloitte GmbH relating to causation, (v) the submission of an expert report by
Professor Tietje regarding RoK’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and finally (vi)
material parts of RoK’s geological experts Gaffney Cline (6)

This list is by no means exhaustive. RoK, however, is conscious of its duty only to bring
such procedural mistakes to the attention of the Court that had an impact on the outcome
of the case. All of the issues referred to here, relate to questions that were of utmost
importance for the decision in this case. In each case, the Tribunal could not have arrived
at the decisions reached if it had taken into account the expert reports and further
evidence provided by RoK. These mistakes have therefore affected the outcome of the
proceedings.

The fact that the Tribunal ignored virtually all expert evidence, in particular those
pertaining to jurisdiction and liability is particularly troublesome. Shortly before the Hearing
on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal apparently was aware that some expert reports
had been submitted, certainly because both parties initially requested to hear all of the
other Parties’ experts at the Hearing. However, the Tribunal expressed its concerns
regarding the limited amount of time available and stated by letter of 27 August 2012 that
‘fin particular, in view of the extensive reports of most experts, the Tribunal considers that
oral examination of most experts may not be necessary.” |In view of this statement, both
Parties subsequently withdrew their requests to examine the other Parties’ experts,
assuming that the Tribunal would therefore pay specific attention to the written expert
reports. However, as it turned out, the Tribunal later seems to not only disregarded these
“extensive reports”, it would seem that the reports were entirely forgotten or overlooked.

The Tribunal decided on the classification of pipelines under Kazakh law without
considering Kazakh law and related expert evidence

One crucial issue of the dispute was the classification of certain pipelines for
transportation of oil and gas that Stati’ companies KPM and TNG operated. It was a key
pillar of Stati’ allegations of harassment that they were wrongly accused of operating trunk
pipelines rather than field pipelines and were ultimately found guilty of the crime of illegal
entrepreneurship, i.e. the operation of a trunk pipeline without the necessary licence. Even
though RoK submitted reports by legal and technical experts on this issue as well as
witness evidence by the expert who evaluated the pipeline in February 2009, to support its
position that Stati had indeed operated trunk pipelines, the Tribunal completely ignored
these reports in arriving at its decision that Stati had only operated field pipelines and thus
supporting Stati’ claims that the criminal proceedings had been “fabricated”.

(i) The Parties’ claims

It is Rok’s position that during inspections in late 2008, a suspicion arose that KPM and
TNG were operating trunk pipelines without a license, which constitutes a criminal offence
according to Section 190(2)(b) of the Kazakh Criminal Code if the operation generates a
certain amount of income.

Subsequently, criminal proceedings were initiated on the suspicion that a crime was
committed. It was obvious and undisputed that Stati had no license for the operation of
trunk pipeline but they denied the assertion that they were operating trunk pipelines.

Ultimately, the competent court found that Defendants were operating trunk pipelines and
that therefore in lack of a license for this operation a criminal offence had been committed.
KPM'’s director, Mr. Cornegruta, was convicted and KPM was ordered to return the
equivalent to the illegally obtained income.

RoK submitted reports by two experts, one legal expert report by Professor Didenko and
one technical expert report by Mr. Latifov, which both supported Rok’s position on the
classification of the pipelines.'"° RoK also submitted a witness statement of Mr.
Baymaganbetov who had acted as expert in the proceedings before the City Court of
Aktau.

Stati, however, held that RoK had not discovered that KPM and TNG were operating trunk
pipelines without a licence but had rather arbitrarily re-classified these pipelines in order to
find a pre-text for an eventual take-over of the companies. Stati presented this as one of
the central actions of a Kazakh playbook and harassment campaign against Stati. In order
to support this position, Stati also provided an expert report which stated that they had not
operated trunk pipelines but rather only field pipelines within the meaning of Kazakh law.

(ii) The Tribunals disregard of Kazakh law and relevant expert and
witness evidence

The Tribunal followed Stati’ position that Stati were not operating trunk pipelines. In its
presentation of the cornerstones of its finding on liability, the Tribunal’s stated that it was
persuaded that the at-issue pipelines were not trunk pipelines requiring licensure but were
rather arbitrarily re-classified by RoK.'""

In arriving at this conclusion, the Tribunal completely ignored the expert reports submitted
by Rok, the witness statement and testimony of Mr. Baymaganbetov and indeed it
completely ignored Kazakh law, which governs the question of whether a pipeline is
classified as a trunk or a field pipeline under Kazakh law.

Several indicators leave no doubt that the Tribunal failed to consider Kazakh law and the
relevant evidence.

First, the Tribunal itself provided what may be an explanation for not looking at the law
and the expert reports. Before concluding that Stati were not operating trunk pipelines, the
Tribunal first stated that it did not have to decide this question:

“The Tribunal need not opine on whether the pipeline was a field or
trunk pipeline in order to find that the procedure surrounding the
discovery was in violation of the FET standard.”"”

Had the Tribunal indeed not decided this question, it would still be a challenge ground
because this would have meant that the Tribunal had completely disregarded the central
argument by RoK that Stati were indeed operating trunk pipelines and therefore the
criminal proceedings as well as the ultimate verdict were perfectly legal. However, as is
obvious from reading the Award two paragraphs further down, the Tribunal actually
decided that Stati were not operating trunk pipelines by holding that it

‘is persuaded that the at-issue pipelines, likewise, were not trunk
pipelines requiring licensure but were rather arbitrarily re-classified
by Respondent. That the City Court of Aktau found that the pipes
were trunk does not bind this Tribunal.”'* (emphasis added)

What in any event is clear from this somewhat nebulous section of the Award is that not
wanting to consider Kazakh law and the expert reports on this question, the immediate
consequence of the Tribunal’s judgment was therefore that the Financial Police had
“reverse-engineered” a crime and the City Court of Aktau had erred. This conclusion has
influence the Tribunal’s assessment of Rok’s alleged breaches of the ECT.

Secondly, the fact that the Tribunal failed to look at Kazakh law and the relevant expert
reports is obvious from its lack of reference to the applicable law and its requirements and
indeed to any of the expert reports submitted by RoK.

Looking at the Award, it shows that the Tribunal has overlooked or forgotten that such
expert evidence was submitted by RoK.

Together with its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Liability, RoK submitted two expert reports
regarding classification of pipelines; one by Mr. Latifov, focusing on the technical aspects
and one by Professor Didenko focusing on the legal aspects. RoK further submitted a
second and a third expert report by Professor Didenko together with the First and Second
Post-Hearing Briefs.

Mr. Latifov’s expert report finds no mentioning at any place in the Award. The Tribunal not
only fails to mention this expert report in its summary of Rok’s position or in its own
reasoning. It also fails to mention that RoK even had submitted this expert report. Even
though the expert report was submitted with RoK’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Liability,
the Tribunal fails to expressly acknowledge this in its Procedural History.'"* In fact, a word
search of the Award for Mr. Latifov's name delivers no result at all...

The first and the second expert reports prepared by Professor Didenko are not mentioned
at any point in the Award. Even though RoK heavily relied on Professor Didenko’s expert
reports in support of its position regarding the classification of the pipelines, the Tribunal
even fails to mention Professor Didenko’s expert reports in its summary of Rok’s
arguments. It also fails to mention Professor Didenko’s expert reports in its reasoning.
However, not only does the Tribunal fail to mention Professor Didenko’s expert reports in
the reasoning of the Award, the Tribunal also fails to mention in the procedural history that
RoK had submitted these expert reports in summary of its stand in the arbitration.

The Tribunal does not expressly mention that Professor Didenko’s first expert report was
submitted with the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Liability.""° Equally, the Tribunal fails to
expressly mention that Professor Didenko’s second expert report was submitted with the
1st Post-Hearing Brief.'"° The only report by Professor Didenko that is mentioned
anywhere in the Award is Professor Didenko’s third expert report but even this report is
only mentioned in the procedural history and nowhere else.''’ The fact that two of
Professor Didenko’s expert reports find no mention in the award at all, while his third
report is only mentioned in the Procedural History leads undeniably to the conclusion that
the Tribunal entirely ignored but possibly even failed to notice or forgot these pieces of
evidence which obviously were crucial to Rok’s case.

The Tribunal also did not refer to or otherwise consider in its reasoning the witness
statement and testimony of Mr. Baymaganbetov who had acted as an expert in the
criminal proceedings.

(iii) The Tribunal exceeded its mandate by deciding a question of Kazakh
law without looking at Kazakh law

First, the Tribunal by deciding on a question of Kazakh law without even considering or
applying Kazakh law exceeded its mandate. The Tribunal stated that it agrees with the
Parties that pursuant to Art. 22 (1) SCC Rules and Art. 26(6) ECT, the Tribunal shall
decide the merits of the dispute in accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and
principles of international law. By holding that “the at-issue pipelines, likewise, were not
trunk pipelines requiring licensure but were rather arbitrarily re-classified by Respondent’,
the Tribunal decided a question of Kazakh law because the classification of pipelines in
Kazakhstan without any doubt is a question of Kazakh law. For this reason, both Parties
had submitted legal opinions on the question of classification of pipelines under Kazakh
law; Stati had submitted legal expert reports by Professor Suleymenov, RoKs had
submitted legal expert reports by Professor Didenko. The Parties were therefore in
agreement that whether a pipeline should be considered a trunk or field pipeline needed
to be decided in accordance with Kazakh law.

Had the Tribunal indeed not decided whether the pipelines at issue were trunk or not, as it
alluded, it may not have needed to refer to Kazakh law. When the Tribunal decided that
the pipelines at issue were field pipelines as opposed to trunk pipelines without referring
to the legal framework and requirements for such a classification under Kazakh law, the
Tribunal certainly exceeded its mandate. The Parties were never in agreement that the
Tribunal should decide issues that purely relate to Kazakh law without looking at the
relevant law on an ex aequo et bono basis. It was within the Tribunal’s mandate whether
for instance the criminal proceedings violated the ECT but it was not within the Tribunal’s
mandate to decide a question of Kazakh law without looking at Kazakh law. It is
impossible to conclude that a pipeline is trunk (under Kazakh law) by merely looking at a
timeline of several events but this is a question that needs to be decided in accordance
with the applicable law. Trunk pipeline and field pipeline are terms of Kazakh law that a
Tribunal cannot ignore.

(iv) The Tribunal has committed a procedural irregularity which influenced
the outcome of the case

The Tribunal’s complete failure to even take notice of such crucial pieces of evidence
such as the reports of Professor Didenko and Mr. Latifov also constitutes a procedural

irregularity that affected the outcome of the case.

It is a well-established principle that a tribunal must examine the expert evidence offered,
where it concerns matters of importance for the decision. Offered expert evidence must be

57

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 59 of 92

taken into account if the arbitrators are not experts themselves.''® A party’ right to be
heard entails that its arguments and evidence are considered when they are important for
the decision. The Swiss Supreme Court for example has highlighted that the right to be
heard entails that the arbitrators have a minimum duty to examine all relevant issues and
that they do not satisfy this duty when they disregard (due to an oversight or a
misunderstanding) arguments or evidence in the record which are material to the outcome
of the case.'"°

(246) There can be no doubt that the expert evidence submitted by Professor Didenko and Mr.
Latifov, the witness evidence of Mr. Baymaganbetov as well as RoK’s arguments that Stati
indeed were operating trunk pipelines were matters of utmost importance for the decision.
This question goes to the core of the alleged harassment campaign of a “reverse-
engineered” crime and an illegal award by the City Court of Aktau.

(247) The alleged re-classification of the pipelines from field to trunk pipelines obviously was a
cornerstone for the Tribunal’s finding of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard. The Tribunal itself stated that

‘[t]he re-classification, viewed in light of President Nazarbayev’s 23
November 2009 confidential instruction that was attached to the 7
February 2010 Blagovest letter (C-23), appears to have been an
important step for the State to have obtained the assets of KPM
and TNG, without sacrificing their working ability.”"”°

(248) The Tribunal could not have come to such a conclusion if the Tribunal had taken Rok’s
evidence and arguments that Stati were indeed operating trunk pipelines into
consideration.

5.5.3 The Tribunal decided questions of Kazakh civil law without considering pivotal
expert evidence on Kazakh civil law

(249) In holding Rok liable and in deciding on causation, the Tribunal presented Rok’s alleged
clouding of Stati’ title in TNG as part of a string of measures of co-ordinated harassment.
In making this decision, the Tribunal completely disregarded Rok’s expert evidence
supporting its central counter-argument and evidence that the relevant State actions - in
particular the revocation of the authorisation of a transfer of shares in TNG to Terra Raf
were - in accordance with Kazakh law and fully justified under the circumstances.

(i) The Parties’ claims

The shares in TNG are said to be held by Terra Raf. TNG’s shares had been transferred
several times, before ultimately being transferred from a company called Gheso to Terra
Raf.

One of the main allegations raised be Stati in this case was that in December 2008, RoK
had willfully and illegally revoked its authorisation of this last transfer of shares and had
thus clouded Terra Raf’s title to TNG. Stati’ argued that the revocation was illegal under
Kazakh law and they provided expert reports by Professor Maggs to support this
allegation. Indeed, they referred to this as one of three main acts of wrongdoing, each of
which allegedly by itself constituted breaches of the ECT. '*!

RoK on the other hand argued that its actions were legal. RoK stated that it was fully
justified in querying the position with Stati as to the transfer of TNG from Gheso to Terra
Raf, specifically, that there were irregularities which caused the Republic to consider its
pre-emptive right ignored. The Subsoil Use Law had been amended on 8 December 2004
to introduce a pre-emptive right of the State to acquire shares in an entity that has rights
to the subsoil use. This means that before a transfer of shares in such a company can be
carried out, the intended transfer needs to be notified to the State that can decide whether
the State wants to buy the shares on the terms and conditions agreed by the two parties
to the transaction or whether it waives this pre-emptive right. The transfer only becomes
effective once the State has waived its pre-emptive right. Before this reform in 2004, the
State needed to authorize a transfer but it did not have a pre-emptive right.

RoK had retrospectively authorized the transfer of shares to Terra Raf under the old law
but it had not waived its pre-emptive right. It was Rok’s position that it had sufficient
grounds to believe that Terra Raf had been registered as shareholder in 2005 without the
pre-emptive right being considered and that it should therefore revoke the authorization of
the transfer given under the law preceding the 2004 reforms because the State had
wrongly been led to believe that its pre-emptive right did not apply.

Large sections of RoK’s expert on Kazakh civil law dealt with these issues and explained
that Rok rightfully revoked its prior authorisation. '**

(ii) The Tribunal ignored Professor Illyassova’s evidence and Stati’
arguments

The Tribunal completely ignored RoK’s expert report and arguments in arriving at its
decision that the dispute about the State’s pre-emptive right constituted a part of the
alleged coordinated harassment against Stati.

In deciding liability and causation, the Tribunal heavily relied on the allegation that RoK
had clouded Stati ownership in TNG. First, the dispute regarding Terra Raf’s acquisition of
shares in TNG features prominently in the Tribunal’s timeline in its decision on liability, '**
which is referred to as “a string of measures of coordinated harassment by various
institutions.” °

In its discussion of causation, the Tribunal also refers to the revocation of the
authorisation of the transfer as a date of relevance for causation. '°

The Tribunal referred to this issue as “Kazakhstan’s alleged pre-emptive rights claim”
which “was, no doubt, a cloud on Terra Raf's ownership rights which created continuing
difficulties for Claimants.”'*”

Indeed, the Tribunal even considered this date as one of the potential valuation dates,
referring to it as the “date of MEMR’s challenge to Claimants’ ownership of TG."

Despite heavily relying on the events relating to the dispute regarding the pre-emptive
rights, the Tribunal at no point in its award even considered the expert report by Professor
llyassova and the arguments advanced by Rok that it was fully justified to revoke the
authorisation and enquire whether its pre-emptive right existed.

(iii) The award shall be set aside in accordance of Section 34 (1) p. 6
Swedish Arbitration Act

While in contrast to Professor Didenko and Mr. Latifov, the Tribunal actually mentions
Professor llyassova in its Award, albeit very seldom, it is still obvious that the Tribunal
ignored her expert report in its reasoning. The Tribunal nowhere considered the
arguments that the revocation of the authorization was legal. Rather the Tribunal simply
considered it (without taking into account the counter-arguments) as an improper action.
This is also obvious from the Tribunal’s depiction as an “alleged pre-emptive rights
claim.”'°

Again, the Tribunal has a duty to examine expert evidence when it concerns a question of
importance for the dispute. The events surrounding the dispute relating to the pre-emptive
rights waiver were without any doubt an important issue, pleaded as such by the Parties
and also decided by the Tribunal to be important as it considered the date of the
revocation a potential valuation date.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal failed to fulfill its duty to examine the expert report and the
related arguments. Had the Tribunal considered RoK’s expert report and arguments, it
could not have depicted these events as a part of a string of measures of “concerted
harassment’ and it could not have referred to them in the section on causation. As they
were depicted as crucial parts of both decisions, it has to be assumed that the Tribunal
would have decided otherwise on liability and causation if it had considered these
arguments.

The Tribunal decided questions of Kazakh tax law without considering pivotal
expert evidence on Kazakh tax law

The Tribunal also completely ignored Rok’s submission of an expert report on tax law.
The Tribunal heavily relied on the back tax assessment conducted by Rok’s tax
committee in its finding of liability and quantum. The Tribunal ultimately — surprisingly -
held that it has been Rok’s burden of proof to show that its back tax assessment was not
part of the alleged harrasments by RoK. While this by itself is procedurally questionable,
RoK does not base its challenge on this surprising shift in the burden of proof. Rather the
challenge with regard to the tax assessment is based on the fact that in assessing
whether RoK had shown that the back tax assessment was legal, the Tribunal decided an
issue of Kazakh law without even considering the Kazakh law or the expert evidence
submitted by RoK.

(i) Pleadings by the Parties

One of the disputes in the arbitration that initially featured less prominently in the
arbitration related to the back tax assessments of the Tax Committee on
10 February 2009. These back tax assessments were the result of audits initiated by the
Tax Committee in November of 2008 allegedly on instruction of the Financial Police.
Overall, USD 62 million in back taxes and fines were assessed attributable to KPM and
TNG. The legal question in dispute was which amortisation rate was to be applied to
certain of the drilling expenses of Stati in relation to the exploration of the later operating
fields.

Whereas Stati had filed their taxes on the basis of the application of Article 20 of the
Kazakh Tax Code (entailing a 100% amortisation rate), the Tax Committee applied
Article 23 of the Kazakh Tax Code (leading to only a 25% amortisation rate). Importantly,
the application of these Articles was not only determined by the contents of the Kazakh
Tax Code but also by the contents of KPM’s and TNG’s subsoil use contracts.

In the arbitration, Stati argued inter alia that the back tax assessment was wrong on its
merits. Specifically, Stati argued that Article 20 applied because it covers expenses for
acquisition of fixed assets and a well is such fixed asset.'® Article 23 was not to be
applied because the provisions of the Subsoil Use Contracts that provide for the

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 63 of 92

application of Article 23 did not call for its application with regard to well drilling
131

expenses.

(268) Further, Stati stated that the illegality of the back tax assessment was also confirmed by
the decisions of two lower instance courts which both overturned the back tax
assessment.'*? The Kazakh Supreme Court's decision to overturn these lower instance
decisions should be disregarded because (1) it was rendered only after the assets had
been expropriated and Stati had left the country; '°* and (2) they were contrary to previous
decisions of the Kazakh Supreme Court. ‘**

(269) Conversely, RoK argued that the back tax assessment was correct. To that end, it relied
on an analysis provided by Professor Balco who held that both under the wording of
Article 23 itself, and under the Subsoil Use Contracts, Article 23 applied.'®° Professor
Balco provided two expert reports to that effect.'®° In these reports, he largely set out a
grammatical, teleological and historical interpretation of the Subsoil Use Contracts, in
particular taking into account the original Russian wording of these contracts. '*” Further,
the Republic relied on the decision by the Kazakh Supreme Court.'®* It also showed, by
reference to the arguments provided by Professor Balco, that this decision did not contain
a change in the Supreme Court's position compared to earlier cases. '*°

(ii) The Tribunal’s ruling

(270) The Tribunal decided on the back tax assessments both as a matter of liability and as a
matter of quantum. With regard to liability, it included the audits of the tax committee as
well as the back tax assessment of 10 February 2009 in its timeline of state conduct which
it considered to form part of a string of measures of concerted harassment. '“°

(271) In presenting the back tax assessment as part of the alleged harassment, the Tribunal
failed to even mention any of Rok’s later arguments as evidence to legality of the tax
assessment, simply referring briefly to RoK’s Statement of Defence’ which had not yet
set out Rok’s full position.

“7 award,

In the section on the deduction of debt, the Tribunal briefly mentioned the back tax
assessment and rejected RoK’s argument that the back taxes needed to be deducted
from Stati’ claim. Specifically, the Tribunal held: “Finally, the alleged back tax obligations
were created by Respondent's conduct which this Tribunal found above to be a breach of
the ECT. Further, KPM and TNG prevailed in their court challenges of the tax
assessments. The only appellate decision in favour of Respondent was issued after the
seizure of the investment in a review process alleged by Claimants to have been
conducted without their knowledge or participation. In any case, the Tribunal considers
that Respondent has not fulfilled its burden of proof that the tax assessment would have
been valid even without the conduct found to be a breach above in this Award.”"**

In a further quantum section of the award, the Tribunal again addressed the back tax
assessment" although it is not clear what has caused the Tribunal to give these
comments. In any event, the Tribunal states that it “recalls its timeline, above in this Award
in the chapter on liability of Respondent’s conduct, through which it found Respondent
[sic] to be a breach of its ECT obligation for FET. It further recalls its conclusions, above in
this Award in the chapter on the relevance of debts, insofar as they deal with tax
assessments.” It then goes on to state that all of the alleged back tax obligations were
created by and during RoK’s conduct after October 2008 which the Tribunal has found to
have breached the ECT. '°

In consequence, the Tribunal put the burden of proof for showing that the back tax
assessments were not part of the breach of RoK, arguing that the tax assessments were
all retro-active assessments for back taxes which had not been assessed during a period
when the relationship between the Parties had still been normal. '“°

Importantly, the Tribunal only looked at the Supreme Court decision in favour of RoK and
stated that this decision, “in the judgment of the present Tribunal, is not sufficient to fulfill
Respondent's burden of proof that the assessment would have been the same without
Respondent's breaching conduct.”"*’ It is therefore obvious that this was the only piece of
counter-evidence that the Tribunal looked at. The Tribunal completely failed to consider
the expert reports and testimony of Professor Balco.

(iii) The arbitral award shall be set aside in accordance with the Section 34
(1) point 2 and point 6 Swedish Arbitration Act

In depicting RoK’s back tax assessment as part of a string of measures of harassment,
the Tribunal treated them as illegal. The Tribunal even went so far as to call the back tax
assessment “a major part of this string of measures [in breach of the ECT].” It is therefore

obvious that the Tribunal’s finding on the back tax assessment were crucial for its decision
on liability.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal ignored RoK’s expert report of Professor Balco and Rok’s
witness evidence from Mr. Rahimgaliev of the tax committee. Similar to Rok’s civil law
expert, Professor llyassova, Professor Balco finds mentioning only in a few cases in the
Tribunal’s summary of the Parties arguments. However, just as Mr. Rahimgaliev, he is
completely ignored in the Tribunal’s reasoning.

As has been demonstrated above, it is the Tribunal’s duty to consider expert reports and
arguments on important points of dispute. By failing to do so, it committed a procedural
mistake.

It has to be assumed that the Tribunal’s decision would have been different if it had
correctly considered Professor Balco’s report and testimony and Mr. Rahimgaliev's
evidence as both contained ample reasons to show that the back tax assessment was
legal. As the Tribunal itself highlighted, it considered the tax assessment to be a “major
part” of Rok’s alleged illegal conduct. Without this “major part”, the Tribunal could not
have upheld its decision on liability issue. Equally, even if it had still found Rok liable, it
would have needed to deduct USD 62 million for the tax claim against Stati from the
amount totally awarded.

In treating the back tax assessment as illegal, the Tribunal also decided a question of
Kazakh law, without even looking at Kazakh law. As has been demonstrated above (see
1.1.3), it was not the mandate of the Tribunal to decide such a question ex aequo et bono
but rather the Tribunal could only decide that the back tax assessment was illegal by
appliance of the Kazakh law.

In deciding on causation, the Tribunal completely ignored RoK’s financial experts

In its finding on causation, the Tribunal completely ignored the report by RoK’s experts
Deloitte GmbH which showed that Stati companies were in financial difficulties irrespective
of the State’s actions; therefore, no causation was existent.

(i) Background

Regarding the issue of causation, one central argument raised by RoK was that of an
intervening cause stopping the chain of causation and entailing that no damages to Stati
could be due. Specifically, RoK argued that Stati’ own actions as well as wholly unrelated
events led to the demise of KPM and TNG.

In that regard, RoK referred in particular to the financing structure of KPM and TNG which
aimed at diminishing cash and profits in Kazakhstan and thus made the companies
vulnerable to situations of crisis. To that end, RoK provided an analysis by Professor

*® Cf. e.g. Respondent's 2 PHB, paras. 60 et seq.

Olcott."“° Moreover, RoK also argued that the financial crisis at the end of 2008 resulted in

a drop in prices and demand that had a negative market effect on KPM and TNG, leading
ultimately to Stati’ decision to abandon the companies.

Importantly, the Republic also provided expert evidence by Deloitte GmbH on the financial
situation of KPM and TNG prior to Stati’ valuation date of 14 October 2008.'*' This
evidence intended to show that the financial troubles of the companies existed
irrespective of the State’s actions. In response to earlier analyses by FTI,"
Deloitte GmbH stated very clearly that they disagreed with FTI’s view that prior to
14 October 2008, there was no risk that KPM and TNG might not be able to meet their
debt service obligations.'®* To support their statement, Deloitte GmbH conducted various
financial analyses based on a thorough review of the publicly available quarterly financial
statements of Tristan. In particular, Deloitte GmbH calculated the so-called current ratio
and showed that the current ratio had been in decline throughout 2008 even before Stati’
valuation date.'®* Further, Deloitte GmbH also calculated the so-called quick ratio and
cash ratio, with both showing a clear deterioration of the financial situation prior to Stati’
valuation date.'® In addition, Deloitte GmbH also conducted a thorough book value of
equity analysis, including an analysis of the equity to assets ratio. ‘°°

Notably, Deloitte GmbH had also conducted a detailed analysis of the financial situation of
KPM, TNG and Tristan by means of looking at the price of the Tristan notes as of
14 October 2008. Deloitte GmbH then found that at the time, the markets were expecting
a default of Tristan, i.e. a failure to fully repay the notes.'°” This entails that the market
forces considered the financial situation of KPM and TNG to be critical.

(ii) The Tribunal disregarded Rok’s and Deloitte GmbH’s pleaded
circumstances on the intervening cause in their entirety

Regarding the causation arguments, the Tribunal first of all determined that Stati had
established a timeline of events which, in the view of the Tribunal, proved that the actions
of RoK had caused harm to Stati’ investments. '®® As a result, the Tribunal considered that
the burden of proof with regard to any intervening cause stopping the chain of causation
was with RoK."®° In the view of the Tribunal, RoK had not been able to provide sufficient

prove to that effect.'®° In particular, the Tribunal considered those financial difficulties of
KPM and TNG that were not attributable to the Republic to be only short term and
intermediate. Specifically, the Tribunal stated:

“Weighing the evidence submitted by the Parties, the Tribunal is not
persuaded by the testimony of Prof. Olcott (who is not an economic
expert) that the annual interest payment on the Tristan notes caused
continuous and negative financial impact on KPM and TNG’s
operations. As Mr. Gruhn of Deloitte did not perform any direct
analysis of KPM and TNG’s abilities to service their debt, the
Tribunal rather accepts FTI’s testimony that the finances of KPM and
TNG were in good financial condition prior to October 2008, having
respective current ratios of 3.1 and 3.0. niet

As a result, the Tribunal concluded that “Respondent has not submitted sufficient
evidence that Claimants’ inexperience or own actions caused or contributed in a relevant
way to the damages that occurred to Claimants’ investment."

Evidently, the Tribunal’s statement that Deloitte GmbH did not perform any direct analysis
of KPM and TNG’s abilitiy to service their debt is entirely incorrect. As set out above,
Deloitte GmH analyzed the financial statements of Tristan and came to clear conclusions
as regards the financial situation of KPM and TNG. The Tribunal’s statement as well as its
reference to the current ratios calculated by FTI clearly demonstrates the Tribunal’s failure
to take note of and evaluate all the evidence offered.

(iii) The arbitral award shall be set aside in accordance with Article 34 (1)
p.2and p. 6 SAA

Due to the Tribunal’s error set out above, the Award can be challenged under Article 34
item 6 SAA. This error amounts to a procedural irregularity because the Tribunal patently
failed to consider evidence on an important issue that had been submitted by RoK.

As set out above, a tribunal must examine the expert evidence offered where it concerns
matters of importance for its decision. In the present case, the arguments of an
intervening cause were clearly of importance. This can be seen from the fact that both
Parties devoted extensive pleadings to the issue. Moreover, the fact that both Parties had
their experts look into and comment on the matter underscores the relevance that the
Parties attributed to the matter. Nonetheless, the Tribunal failed entirely to address the
arguments made and the expert evidence provided. The Tribunal’s conclusion was thus
based on a procedural error.

This procedural irregularity has also affected the outcome of the case. Had the Tribunal
taken into account the arguments presented by RoK and Deloitte GmbH, it could not have
easily dismissed the argument of an intervening cause. Instead, it would have had to take
note of the fact that KPM’s and TNG’s financial situation had been worsening throughout
2008, i.e. prior to the financial crisis. Against this background, it would not have been
possible for the Tribunal to simply state that KPM’s and TNG’s financial troubles were only
short term in nature and could have been overcome but for the State’s actions. Rather,
there were structural deficiencies which should have led the Tribunal to find an intervening
cause stopping the chain of causation. In turn, this would have required the Tribunal to
dismissed the claim.

The Tribunal has decided a matter regarding international law and EU-law without
considering RoK’s expert evidence regarding those law areas

As already explained above in section 5.3, the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear
and decide the case insofar as it pertains to Terra Raf, because Terra Raf is a company
incorporated in Gibraltar to which the ECT does not apply. While the Tribunal’s ruling on
this matter is already challengeable for this reason alone, it is noteworthy that the basis for
the Tribunal’s defective ruling was, again, the Tribunal’s disregard for the expert testimony
provided by RoK. Had the Tribunal reviewed Rok’s pleadings and especially the expert
report of Professor Tietje, the Tribunals judgment in this part would have been different.

The Tribunal’s decision and its complete disregard of Professor Tietje’s arguments can
only be seen as a conscious disregard of the expert report provided by the Professor.

The Tribunal relied on Stati’s geological experts without providing any reasons and
while completely ignoring the expert reports and testimony of RoK’s geological
experts

The proceedings regarding the calculation of the damages were dominated by questions
of geology and valuation. It was always clear that the geological assessment of the
assets, in particular the Tolkyn and Bornakol fields, were the cornerstone of the valuation.
The Parties’ geological experts provided reserves estimates based on which the valuation
experts attributed a certain value to the fields.

There was a fierce fight between the geological experts regarding methodology and
volumes. The Tribunal, however, in one single sentence, decided that it would follow Stati’
geological experts for its assessment without giving any kind of explanation. In doing so,
the Tribunal did not provide a shred of explanation. Equally, it committed a procedural
mistake by failing to consider RoK’s expert reports that had provided a detailed criticism of
Stati’ expert reports.

(i) The Parties’ submissions

The both Parties submitted expert reports on geology in the hearings. RoK submitted in
total four expert reports by its geological experts Gaffney Cline & Associates (GCA) and

67

Error! Unknown document property name.

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 69 of 92

Stati equally submitted four expert reports by their geology experts Ryder Scott. These
expert reports were crucial to the quantum to be awarded because the reserve estimates
became the basis for the Parties’ respective valuation experts. In addition, GCA also
provided expertise regarding the necessary future capital and operational expenditure,
which also affect the valuation. The geology experts were also heard at the Hearing on
Quantum and at the Final Hearing.

(297) One difference between experts reserve estimates was due to the fact that Stati instructed
their experts to make a reserves estimate as of 14 October 2008 while RoK instructed its
experts to make a reserves estimate as of 21 July 2010, the respective valuation dates
advanced by the Parties. However, there were also fundamental disputes regarding
methodology and volumes for both Borankol and Tolkyn, irrespective of the valuation
date. This is best illustrated by the joint issue list, drafted by both experts before the
Quantum Hearing.

(298) Naturally, GCA’s reports not only contained justifications of their own findings. They also
included detailled criticism of Ryder Scott's findings. RoK summarised the criticism of
Ryder Scott's findings for example in its First Post-Hearing Brief.'°°

(299) In addition, RoK explained in detail why Ryder Scott's work was unreliable.‘ In its
second Post-Hearing Brief, RoK explicitly stated that:

"there can be no doubt that the work performed by Ryder Scott is
unreliable and not adequate to form the basis of a fair market value
assessment. It is largely based on fictional recompletion potential that
is not supported by the well data or production history.”

(ii) The Tribunal's choice of Stati’ expert report without providing any
grounds

(300) The Tribunal, in deciding whether to rely on the reserves estimates provided by Ryder
Scott simply stated that the Tribunal "considers that the Ryder Scott reports on reserves
estimates are convincing in their approach and results.”'°

(301) In just one single sentence Tribunal stated that it considered the Ryder Scott reports
"convincing in their approach and results’. Such a sentence may be the starting point for
an explanation what the approach and the results were and why the Tribunal considered
them convincing but there no explanation was given. In fact, not a single reason for this
assessment was given.

(iii) The arbitral award shall be set aside in accordance with Section 34 (1)
p. 6 Swedish Arbitration Act

In deciding to follow the Ryder Scott reports, the Tribunal made two procedural mistakes.
First, it did not provide any grounds for its decision to rely on Ryder Scott and secondly, it
completely ignored the criticism of Ryder Scott's expert evidence by GCA.

The Parties’ choice of the SCC Rules entails an obligation for the Tribunal to provide
reasons for its decision. While it is accepted that the Supreme Court has stated that only a
complete lack of grounds or grounds that, having regard to the circumstances, must be
deemed so incomplete that the situation can be equated to no grounds whatsoever, can
constitute a ground for challenge, it is RoK’s position that this is one of those rare cases.

As has been stated above, it is obvious that the question of choosing the correct reserves
estimates has been pivotal. Whether or not the Tribunal could follow Ryder Scott's expert
reports was therefore a question of utmost importance.

Both Parties’ expert reports together contained more than 350 pages, for which a fee of
USD 2 million was charged (almost USD 900,000 for Ryder Scott, more than USD 1.2
million for GCA). There can be no doubt that the question of making the correct choice
regarding the reserves estimates was an extremely important and highly disputed issue.
Deciding such an issue by the single sentence provided must be regarded as providing no
grounds or reasons at all.

The Supreme Court in Soyak v Hochtief held that if such a material procedural error
exists, it can also be presumed that the lack of grounds have affected the outcome of the
case. This is certainly the case here. The Tribunal could not have followed the Ryder Scott
reports if it had considered GCA's criticism.

The Tribunal has also committed a procedural mistake because it has completely ignored

to mention or take into consideration the GCA expert reports and their criticism of the
Ryder Scott reports in its reasoning.

The Tribunal failed to ider the RoK’s objecti that certain i would
need to be made from an eventual award

During the proceedings, RoK raised several objections regarding necessary deductions
from Stati’ damage claim. Some of these objections, the Tribunal addressed and was the
subject for the proceedings. ®” However, the Tribunal completely failed to decide on two of
these objections: (i) The Tribunal did not rule on Rok’s objection that all revenue siphoned
off by Stati’ after the valuation date would need to be deducted, and (ii) the Tribunal failed
to consider and decide on Rok’s objection that any award of compensation for the LPG
Plant could only be for half of the value.

The Tribunal’s failure in this regard constitutes an exceeding of mandate pursuant to
Section 34(1) point 2 SAA or in any event a procedural mistake pursuant to Section 34(1)
point 6 SAA which have affected the outcome of the case. Accordingly, the Award shoall
be set aside to the extent it refers to Quantum, i.e. item N.2.

The Tribunal exceeded its mandate and committed a procedural mistake by failing
to decide on Rok’s objection that all that Stati siphoned off the
valuation date and the date of the termination of their contracts would need to be
deducted from an eventual award

 

The Tribunal has awarded Stati USD 497,685,101.00. In doing so, the Tribunal completely
failed to rule on Rok’s objection that all revenue siphoned off by Stati between the
valuation date and the date of the termination of their subsoil use contracts, i.e. when
Stati’ actually stopped operating the assets, would need to be deducted from an eventual
award. By ignoring this objection, the Tribunal exceeded its mandate and committed a
procedural mistake that influenced the outcome of the case.

(i) Objection by RoK to deduct monies pocketed from an eventual award

It is undisputed that Stati continued to operate the relevant assets during the time from the
valuation date until the date when their subsoil use contracts were terminated. As the
Tribunal chose 31 April 2009 as the valuation date, this means that for almost 15 months
after the valuation date, Stati continued to operate the fields and to produce and sell oil
and gas. It is obvious that from these sales, Stati generated a certain revenue and RoK
pointed to several instances that Defendants diverted this money to related companies or
themselves.

Specifically, RoK argued that the revenue thus siphoned off would need to be deducted
from an eventual award as Stati would otherwise be compensated for profits they had
already pocketed and would thus receive double-compensation.'®* RoK referred to a

dividend distribution in the amount of USD 71.9 million from KPM to Ascom in 2010° and
the extension of the due date and ultimate non-payment of receivables in the amount of
USD 143.4 million due from companies owned by Mr. Stati, namely Stadoil Ltd. and
General Affinity Ltd.'”° RoK added that further outflows were likely to have occurred but
could not be detected due to Stati opaque structure.'”’ As RoK showed in the Arbitration,
these amounts would in any event have needed to be deducted from the award because
the value of an asset is determined by its estimated future cash flows.

Rok’s experts Deloitte GmbH also highlighted with reference to the payment of dividends
and the extension of due dates of trade receivables that

“... with affecting such payments or transfers of assets, a certain part
of the aggregated Asset Values has already been received by the
Claimants or the Stati group, respectively. This portion needs to be
deducted from the damage amount to avoid double compensation of
the alleged damage.”"”

(ii) The Tribunal's failure to decide on Rok’s objection

The Tribunal completely failed to decide on Rok’s objection. At no point in the award did it
consider any of RoK’s objections and at no point these objections were accepted or
rejected. The only place where Rok’s objections are indicated is in the Tribunal’s
summary of the Parties’ arguments regarding the determination of the correct valuation
date.'”® However, RoK had never treated the issue as a question of finding the right
valuation date so that this did in no way related to Rok’s objection.

Underscoring the severity of the Tribunal’s error is the fact that Stati themselves had
acknowledged in their First Post-Hearing Brief that “Kazakhstan repeatedly asserts that
‘Claimants disingenuously claim compensation for profit they already have pocketed.’”'”*
Indeed it was a point of much debate between the parties whether — if a valuation date
prior to the termination of the contracts were chosen — profits made in between those two
dates would need to be deducted. Yet, the Tribunal — even though choosing an early
valuation date — failed completely to decide on this deduction claim.

(iii) The Tribunal violated Section 34 (1) point 2 Swedish Arbitration Act

The Tribunal has rendered the award and has ordered RoK to pay a sum of nearly USD
500 million without considering RoK’s objection that certain monies in excess of USD 200

million, which were siphoned off after the valuation date, would need to be deducted from
an eventual award.

(317) Rok’s request to deduct the profits pocketed can easily be equated with a counter-claim
or a set-off claim. Due to RoK’s objection, the Tribunal was not entitled to limit its
examination of the dispute only to Stati’ claims and some of Rok’s objections to make
deductions.

(318) Indeed, the Tribunal apparently concurred that generally it is under an obligation to
address objections that certain deductions from an award would need to be made. RoK
had made other objections regarding monies that would need to be deducted from an
eventual award, namely debts such as the obligation arising out of the Tristan notes, the
Laren loan and back tax obligations. The Tribunal addressed all of these objections,
rejected the majority of them but also decided to deduct certain debts, such as obligations
under the Reachcom and the Limozen Facility Agreements.'” However, it failed to
address Rok’s objection to deduct in excess of USD 200 million without providing any
explanation. In doing so, the Tribunal ignored that its mandate was to try the dispute as a
whole." The Tribunal's failure in this matter constitutes an excess of its mandate in
accordance with Section 34 (1) p. 2 in SAA.

(319) RoK does not assume that in case of Section 34 (1) item 2 of the Swedish Arbitration Act,
it would need to show that the fact that the Tribunal exceeded its mandate affected the
outcome of the case. Even if the court assumed that this was necessary, however, it could
easily be shown here. Had the Tribunal considered Rok’s objection, it would have needed
to deduct at least USD 71.9 million and USD 143.4 million, i-e. in total USD 215.3 million
from an eventual award.

(iv) In any event, the Tribunal’s failure constitutes a mistake pursuant to
Section 34 (1) point 6 SAA which affected the outcome of the case

(320) The Tribunal’s failure to decide on Rok’s objection to deduct all revenue that Stati
siphoned off between the valuation date and the date of the termination of their contracts
from an eventual award, equally constitutes a procedural mistake within the meaning of
Section 34 (1) point 6 Swedish Arbitration Act. It is well accepted that if the Tribunal fails
to make a ruling on one of several objections, this constitutes a challengeable procedural
mistake.'”’ Again, this procedural mistake affected the case because had the Tribunal
considered this objection, it would have needed to deduct at least USD 215.3 from the
sum of money awarded.

The Tribunal its and/or jitted a pi irregularity by
failing to consider and decide on RoK’s objection that any award of compensation
for the LPG Plant could only be for half of the assumed value.

 

The Tribunal has awarded Stati USD 199 million for the LPG Plant. As shown in section
5.4 above, in arriving at this value, the Tribunal committed a serious procedural mistake
and therefore in any event the award needs to be set aside in as far as it contains the
USD 199 million in value for the LPG Plant. Even if the court were to reject this, the award
would still need to be reduced by USD 99.5 million. This is because the Tribunal failed to
consider and decide on Rok’s objection that an award of damages for the LPG Plant
would need to be halved.

(i) Relevant facts

The Tribunal in awarding damages in the amount of USD 199 million for the LPG Plant
ignored the fact that RoK had continuously argued that if the Tribunal were to award
damages for the unfinished LPG Plant, it could only award 50% of this value to Stati. The
Tribunal however, has failed to even mention this material argument in its reasoning.

In its submissions and at the Final Hearing RoK had repeatedly argued that any award for
damages for the LPG Plant could only be for 50% of the assumed value.’ Rok
explained in detail that TNG had entered into a Joint Operating Agreement with Vitol
according to which the profits from the operation of the LPG Plant would be distributed on
a 50/50 basis.

Rok initially put Stati to prove that the proceeds they could have earned from operating
the LPG Plant under the Joint Venture Agreement were more than half of whichever asset
value they were claiming.” The Defendant's clearly understood this as an objection to
their claim regarding the LPG Plant and addressed this under the heading “Enterprise
Value Damages Likewise Should Not Be Reduced by the Vitol, Tax, and Other Alleged
Debts”.'*°

Because Stati provided no proof that they would have earned more than 50% of the profits
from the LPG Plant in their next written submission, their First Post-Hearing Brief, RoK in
the following demanded that any award of compensation for the LPG Plant could only be
for half the assumed value. '®' This was because even though TNG initially retained 100%
of the ownership of the unfinished plant at the valuation date chosen by the Tribunal, it
would only have received 50% of the profits from its operation because the Joint
Operating Agreement specifically stipulates that the bulk of the profits would be generated
by a 50/50 Joint Venture between Ascom and Vitol which would have marketed the LPG

products once the plant had been put into operation. Therefore, Stati could only be
compensated for 50% of the value of the asset. Otherwise, they would not be put into the
situation but for the alleged breach (as they requested) but they would be put into a better
position that disregards arrangements on future cash flows.

The Tribunal did not mention this argument anywhere in its reasoning regarding the value
of the LPG Plant. It simply assumed a value of USD 199 million based on an indicative bid
by KMG EP without making any deductions. Importantly, this indicative bid had been
made based on the assumption that all profits rather than only 50% of the profits would be
flowing to the bidder.‘

(ii) The Tribunal's failure constitutes an exceeding of mandate pursuant to
Section 34 (1) point 2 or in any event a procedural irregularity pursuant
to Section 34 (1) point 6 SAA, which have affected the outcome of the
case

Rok’s objection that any award of damages for the LPG Plant could only be for 50% of the
assumed value - just as the objection to deduct at least USD 215.3 million from an
eventual award - can be equated with a counter-claim or offset. Based on the reasoning
above, the Tribunal exceeded its mandate by failing to decide on this claim. At the same
time, the Tribunal committed a procedural mistake. This obviously affected the outcome of
the case.

 

The Tribunal has dits and has i pl irregularities
by going beyond the submissions of the Parties and by ignoring the parties’
and the i law on multipl i

 

Introduction

By the Award it is evident that the Tribunal, on multiple occasions, has based this on (i)
circumstances never invoked by the parties, and (ii) alleged concessions never made. In
addition the Tribunal has ignored (iii) circumstances actually invoked by a party and (iv)
the applicable law.

On the basis of the above, RoK applies for the setting aside of the Award as a whole
because the Tribunal exceeded its mandate (SAA, Article 34 item 2) and committed
procedural irregularities that probably influenced the outcome of the case (SAA,
Article 34 item 6). All of these occasions are presented below under sections [ ]-[ ]. These
irregularities individually form grounds for the setting aside of the Award. In any event,
these irregularities put together must lead to the setting aside of the Award.

*®2 The information memorandum on which the indicative bid was based described the joint venture arrangement only very
briefly and did not make reference to the 50% sharing of profits, Project Zenith — Information Memorandum (Exhibit C-70).
Moreover, the internal analysis of KMG EP shows that no such sharing of profits was taken into account, KMG 2008 Asset
Valuation, p.11 (Exhibit C-722).

5.7.2 The Tribunal treated the issue of KazAzot as one of liability even though it was
argued by both Parties only with regard to gas pricing; in so doing, the Tribunal
relied on facts never invoked by either Party and failed to apply the proper law

(330) The Tribunal’s liability finding is critically undermined by procedural errors relating to the
analysis of the actions of KazAzot. With regard to KazAzot, the Tribunal relied on facts
never pleaded by either party, it based its findings on liability and causation on facts only
pleaded by the parties with a view to quantum; moreover, the Tribunal failed to apply the
correct law.

(i) Factual and procedural background

(331) In 2007 and 2008, Stati negotiated with state-owned oil and gas companies, in particular
with KazMunaiGas National Company (“KMG NC”), and KazAzot for the conclusion of the
so-called “Tripartite Agreement”. Stati’ objective in the negotiations was to conclude a
contract for the sale of their gas at high “export prices”. KazAzot was in turn interested in
purchasing gas from Stati in order to supply their fertilizer factory. Since the governor of
the Mangystau region was interested in furthering industrial development in his region, it
was decided that also the state-owned oil and gas companies would become involved.
The idea was that in order to incentivise Stati to supply to KazAzot, KMG NC could share
some of its export rights to Russia with Stati, so that Stati could realise high “export prices”
for all of the gas not sold to KazAzot.

(332) Importantly, in the end, the Tripartite Agreement was not concluded. Rather, an
agreement dated 17 November 2008 was signed by Stati and KMGNC, but not by
KazAzot. At the end of 2008, KazAzot requested time to perform another audit of the
project because the developments due to the financial crisis made it necessary to
reassess the merits of the project, but KazAzot never came around to signing the
agreement.

(ii) The Tribunal’s ruling

(333) The Tribunal’s decisions with regard to KazAzot comprise three major procedural flaws,
each of them justifying that the Award is set aside. First, in the liability'®* and causation’
sections of the Award, the Tribunal made crucial findings relying on facts never pleaded
by either Party. Second, the Tribunal used the Parties’ pleadings relating to KazAzot for
liability and causation in spite of the fact that both Parties had exclusively pleaded this
matter in relation to the gas pricing. Third, in dealing with the matter, the Tribunal also
failed to apply the correct law, namely customary international law on state responsibility,
including the so-called ILC Draft Articles on State Responsibility.

(iii) The Tribunal relied on facts never pleaded by either party

As regards liability, the Tribunal included in its timeline a reference to the
17 November 2008 Tripartite Agreement, mentioning that KazAzot never signed the
agreement. '®° This timeline was decisive for the Tribunal to find a breach of the standard
of fair and equitable treatment (FET).'®° In addition to the timeline, the Tribunal included a
phrase in its reasoning stating that “[Claimants] point to the close relationships said to
exist between KMG, under the chairmanship of Mr. Kulibayev, and the KazAzot resistance
to signing the Tripartite Agreement after over two years of negotiations and the signature
of the other two parties to the agreement.”*’ The Tribunal then went on to state that ‘it is
more probable than not that there was State influence at play with respect to the failure by
KazAzot to sign the Tri-Partite Agreement.”""*®

Further, in a repetition of the findings on FET, the Tribunal stated: “The Claimants argue
that the evident relationships between President Nazarbayev and his son-in-law are
reason enough to believe that the Kazakh State was the cause of the various difficulties
they encountered in securing their gas sales and export rights commencing in the fall of
2008 and continuing into 2009. They point to the close relationships said to exist between
KMG, under the chairmanship of Mr. Kulibayev, and the KazAzot resistance to signing the
Tripartite Agreement after over two years of negotiations and the signature of the other
two parties to the agreement.”®°

These findings on liability and causation are based on an alleged statement by Stati that
Stati have in fact never made. The Tribunal can only be understood to believe Stati to
allege that RoK exercised influence on KazAzot through “KMG"'®° and Mr. Kulibayev in
order to make KazAzot refuse to sign the Tripartite Agreement. However, Stati have never
made such an allegation.

(iv) The Tribunal relied on the KazAzot matter for liability and quantum
even though the Parties had always argued the matter as one of gas
pricing

The second procedural error with regard to KazAzot stems from the fact that the Parties
and in particular Stati always argued the issue of KazAzot as one of quantum, namely the
price of gas, and not of liability or causation. It is therefore outside the pleadings for the
Tribunal to rely on the KazAzot issue as part of liability and causation.

(v) The Tribunal failed to apply the correct law regarding the attribution of
KazAzot's actions to the state

(338) The Tribunal failed to apply the customary international law on state responsibility to the
matter of KazAzot’s decision not to sign the Tripartite Agreement.

(339) In investment arbitration, the actions and omissions of an entity other than the state itself
can only be attributed to the state if the requirements of customary international law for
such attribution are fulfilled.'®' Investment tribunals as well as the ICJ have regularly
considered the customary international law rules on attribution to be codified in the ILC
Draft Articles on State Responsibility’ (the “ILC Draft Articles") and have applied these
articles for attribution matters (in particular Articles 4, 5 and 8).'*° Other international
bodies such as the WTO Appellate Body also apply the ILC Draft Articles." Since
KazAzot is undisputedly a company organised under private law, KazAzot's decision not
to sign the Tripartite Agreement could only have been attributed to the State based on
customary international as outlined in the ILC Draft Articles.

(340) The Award however does not make any reference to either Article 4, 5 or 8 of the ILC
Draft Articles. Neither does the Award mention the jurisprudence of the ICJ or investment
arbitration tribunals relating to these articles or to customary international law in general.
Instead, the Tribunal treated the issue of attribution as one of a “close relationship”
between Mr. Kulibayev, KMG and KazAzot, without making any reference to the
requirements of the Articles or legal considerations in general."® This in_ itself
demonstrates that the Tribunal simply ignored the applicable law.

(341) The Tribunal refers to the ILC Draft Articles in other instances in the Award, namely when
setting out the standards for the determination of a causal link between the breach and
the damages'** and with regard to the concept of loss of opportunity in the damage
calculation, '®” where the Tribunal stated explicitly that it relied on the ILC Draft Articles.

The fact that it did not mention the ILC Draft Articles in connection to KazAzot proves that
the Tribunal did not apply these rules when dealing with KazAzot.

(vi) Challenge grounds under Article 34 SAA

The errors identified above allow for the setting aside of the Award under
Article 34 items 2 and 6 of the SAA.

To begin with, the Tribunal’s reliance on facts never invoked by either Party constitutes an
excess of mandate in the meaning of Article 34 item 2 of the SAA.

It is well recognised that a tribunal exceeds its mandate if it relies on legal grounds not
invoked by either party. A tribunal is bound to the legal grounds relied on by the parties
when deciding the case. This follows from the consensual nature of arbitration and its
basis in party autonomy; the parties are the masters of the proceedings. '* The scope of
the arbitration and the mandate of the Tribunal are thus set by the Parties’ oral and written
submissions. If a tribunal, as in this case, bases its award on facts or grounds which have
not been invoked by the parties, the tribunal thus enlarges the dispute in a way which
comes as a surprise to the parties when they receive the award. Such action by a tribunal
consequently has to be characterized as an excess of the mandate given to the
tribunal. °

Moreover, the Tribunal’s use of the KazAzot issue as part of its liability and causation
findings constitutes a separate and further instance of the Tribunal exceeding its mandate.
The Parties had pleaded the issue as one of gas pricing and thus only with view to the
quantum issue. Instead, the Tribunal has transferred what has been submitted regarding
KazAzot to the Tribunal’s consideration of the issues regarding liability and causation. The
Tribunal thus exceeded its mandate given by way of the Parties’ written and oral
submissions.

In that regard, the case of Systembolaget AB v V&S Vin & Sprit Aktiebolag’” gives some
useful guidance. It shows that a fact invoked by a party in relation to one aspect of a case
cannot be used by the tribunal in relation to a different aspect of a case.*”' An error of that
kind in itself allows for the setting aside of the award due to the Tribunal’s excess of its
mandate.

Lastly, the Tribunal’s failure to apply customary international law for the question of
attribution of KazAzot’s action forms a further reason for the setting aside of the Award.

(351)

Under Swedish arbitration law, the Tribunal must apply the law chosen by the parties.*°*
Presently, according to ECT Article 26(6), the Parties had chosen as the applicable law
the ECT as well as “applicable rules and principles of international law’. The latter
naturally includes customary international law on the attribution of actions to the state. The
Tribunal however failed entirely to apply the relevant customary international law.

In its finding regarding the INTERFAX press item, the Tribunal invoked a fact never
put forward by either Party and then relied on this fact by arguing that it was
uncontested by RoK

The Tribunal’s findings regarding liability are compromised by procedural errors committed
in connection to the treatment of the INTERFAX press report. Specifically, the Tribunal
incorrectly based its findings on a fact that was never invoked by either Party, arguing that
such fact was uncontested.

(i) Factual and procedural background

On 18 December 2008, the Kazakh Ministry of Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources
(the “MEMR’) cancelled its decision dated 20 February 2007 to approve the transfer of the
shares in TNG from Gheso to Terra Raf and requested TNG to submit a new application
for the transfer. On the same day, INTERFAX Kazakhstan (“INTERFAX”) published a
press report about this decision. According to Stati, the MEMR’s decision, combined with
the publication by INTERFAX, “clouded” Terra Raf's title to TNG which in turn made it
impossible for Stati to obtain debt financing on the market. Also, these circumstances
allegedly led to a drop in value of the Tristan notes and to rating agencies downgrading
the notes issued. Stati believed that the INTERFAX report was caused by a conscious
leak of information by state authorities and they contested the legality of the MEMR’s
decision. Importantly, Stati never argued that the INTERFAX report was caused by actions
of the state taken in October or November 2008. The press report only referred to the pre-
emptive rights waiver issue and the MEMR’s decision in December 2008, not to the
inspections or tax audits that took place in October or November 2008.

In response, RoK argued that the MEMR’s decision was legal and that in any event, the
INTERFAX press report could not be attributed to the Republic as it was issued by a
private news agency.

(ii) The Tribunal’s ruling

In the Award, the Tribunal included the MEMR decision and the INTERFAX press report in
its timeline of events for the finding of a breach of the FET.” In so doing, the Tribunal
had to deal with Rok’s objection that the press report could not be attributed to the State.
The Tribunal held:

“In this context, Respondent’s argument that the INTERFAX item
cannot be attributed to the Republic does not change the impact.
Even if Claimants have not shown that the Republic was in any way
involved in the publication of the INTERFAX item, it is obvious and not
disputed by Respondent, that it was Respondent’s actions
starting in October 2008 that caused the publication.” (emphasis
added)

With this statement, the Tribunal argued that the INTERFAX press report was caused by
actions taken by RoK already in October and November 2008. This, however, was a fact
never even invoked by Stati. Clearly, the Tribunal’s ruling was beyond its scope and
constitutes an excess of mandate, resulting in a serious procedural irregularity.

As a consequence, the Tribunal’s statement that RoK never disputed these facts becomes
patently absurd. Reasonably, RoK did not contest a fact that was never invoked by Stati.
This cannot be held against RoK but rather adds to the Tribunal’s procedural mistake.

(iii) Challenge grounds under Article 34 SAA

Because of the error identified above, the Award can be challenged under
Article 34 item 2 and item 6 of the SAA.

As set out above, it is well recognised that a tribunal exceeds its mandate if it relies on
facts not invoked by either party. Such a mistake is further aggravated where, as in the
present case, a tribunal not only relies on a fact never invoked but also considers this fact
obvious and uncontested. In total, there can be no doubt that the Tribunal committed a
challengeable error.

In addition, the Tribunal’s ruling, as described above, is a serious violation of the principle
of due process. The separate challenge ground in Article 34 item 6 of the SAA is therefore
also invoked."

In its findings regarding the Financial Police, the Tribunal relied on facts never
invoked by either Party and on an alleged admission by RoK that was never made

On top of the two procedural errors outlined above, the Tribunal’s liability finding is further
tainted by the fact that the Tribunal committed two major procedural mistakes regarding
the conduct of the Kazakh Financial Police. The Tribunal both relied on facts never
invoked by either Party and on an alleged admission by RoK that was never made.

(i) Factual and procedural background

A central pillar of Stati’ liability argument was the claim that the State orchestrated a
harassment campaign against Stati. Central to this claim was the allegation that the

Financial Police was the driving force in criminal inspections and investigations against
KPM and TNG. According to Stati, the Financial Police had the goal of finding a crime
which could be attributed to KPM and TNG to be able to impose a “crippling fine” which, in
turn, would allow expropriating the companies.

(359) Rok has always denied this allegation and held throughout the Arbitration that the
Financial Police merely acted upon reasonable suspicion of a crime having been
committed.

(ii) The Tribunal’s ruling

(360) In deciding on the matter, the Tribunal relied on facts never invoked by either Party and
also on an alleged admission by RoK that was never made.

(361) Specifically, in its findings on the alleged breach of the ECT’s fair and equitable treatment
standard, the Tribunal included in its timeline of events the following statement:

“On 10 December 2008, the Financial Police reported to the Deputy
Prime Minister that the Financial Police had determined that KPM
and TNG were operating trunk oil and gas pipelines without
licenses.*”° (emphasis added)

(362) Such allegations was never even made by Stati.

(363) Moreover, the Tribunal relied on an alleged admission by RoK that was never made.
Specifically with regard to the 10 December 2008 letter of the Financial Police, the
Tribunal went on to state:

“Although Respondent states that ‘no decision had been reached as to
whether or not the pipelines were trunk at this point’ (RPHB 1 [ 197), this
statement is belied by C-448. The Tribunal believes Respondent’s
earlier statement acknowledging that the Financial Police had,
indeed, concluded that KPM and TNG were operating trunk
pipelines, even though they were not legally competent to make that
classification. (R-II 1] 473 — 474).”°°° (emphasis provided)

(364) A close look at the relevant section of RoK’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Liability, to
which the Tribunal refers, confirms that the acknowledgement assumed by the Tribunal
was never made. This section reads:

“Mr Turganbaev reported back to the Prime Minster’s [sic] office to

explain how the inspections had progressed on 10 December 2008. In
his letter, as Claimants note, Mr Turganbaev did mention that ‘it is

(368)

(369)

ascertained that “Kazpolmunay” LLP and “Tolkyneftegas” LLP are
operating trunk oil and gas pipelines’. However, the letter, as
Claimants acknowledge, goes on to explain the considerations upon
which the Financial Police’s statement is based and the fact that
further enquiries needed to be made because since, the Financial
Police are not the competent authority in relation to the classification
of pipelines, ‘it is impossible to make a lawful procedural decision in
respect of this case’. The letter goes on to explain that requests were
being made of the licensing agencies to establish whether they could
provide a view on whether the pipelines were trunk or not, taking into
account the “functions actually performed” by those pipelines.””

So even at this stage, it is clear that the Financial Police, though it had
procured information on the amount of profits gained by KPM and
TNG and had information about the licences held by the companies,
and had also made enquiries of the Ministry of Justice, had not yet
reached a definition [sic] conclusion as to whether the KPM or
TNG pipelines were trunk or not. It is absurd to suggest that the
‘classification of pipelines’ was premeditated when, even at this stage,
two months after the inspection of TNG and KPM'’s fields, no final
conclusion had yet been drawn.” (emphasis added)

By reading this statement, it is obvious that rather than acknowledging any premature
determination, RoK had stated just the opposite of what the Tribunal then chose to
“believe”. Hence, the Tribunal not only relied on facts never invoked by either Party, it also
relied on an alleged admission by RoK that was never made.

(iii) Challenge grounds under SAA Article 34

Due to the errors identified above, the Award must be set aside under SAA
Article 34 item 2 and item 6.

When deciding a case, an arbitral tribunal is restricted to the legal grounds relied on by
the parties.

As set out above, it is well recognised that a tribunal exceeds its mandate if it relies on
facts not invoked by either party. Such mistake is further aggravated where, as in the
present case, a tribunal not only relies on a fact never invoked but also considers this fact
to be admitted. Hence, there can be no doubt that the Tribunal committed a challengeable
error.

In addition, the Tribunal’s ruling, as described above, constitutes a serious violation of the
right to due process.

5.7.5 Regarding the issue of debt deduction, the Tribunal incorrectly considered a certain
legal understanding as admitted by RoK and thus failed to take into account legal
arguments pleaded by RoK

(i) Factual background

(370) Considerable debates were conducted in the arbitral proceedings related to the issue of
the so-called Tristan notes. The Tristan notes were publicly traded notes issued between
2006 and 2009 through which Stati financed their activities in Kazakhstan.°°° The first note
issuance at the end of 2006 amounted to USD 300 million. A second volume of notes was
issued in Summer of 2007 amounting to USD 120 million. Further, in the summer of 2009,
another USD 111.1 million in Tristan notes were issued. The issuer and thus primary
debtor under the notes was the B.V.I. company Tristan Oil Ltd. (“Tristan”) which was
wholly owned by Anatolie Stati.

(371) The securing mechanisms for the Tristan debt are central to the understanding of the debt
structure and its relevance for the case. The obligations under the Tristan Indenture were
secured primarily with personal pledges by KPM and TNG. Thus, Tristan, KPM and TNG
were liable for the Tristan debt and guaranteed it with practically all of their assets.
Moreover, the Tristan debt was further guaranteed with pledges by the stockholders in
Tristan, KPM and TNG. This means that Anatolie Stati pledged his shares in Tristan,
Ascom pledged its shares in KPM and Terra Raf pledged its shares in TNG. Importantly,
the pledges by Anatolie Stati, Ascom and Terra Raf were not personal but were limited to
these shares. These facts were uncontested in the Arbitration.

(ii) Procedural background

(372) Throughout the arbitration, Stati claimed for the so-called enterprise value of KPM and
TNG, i.e. for the value of all of the assets without deducting the Tristan debt guaranteed
by KPM and TNG. Central to Stati’ claim in that regard was their allegation that in case an
award were to be rendered in favour of Ascom and Terra Raf, Ascom and Terra Raf would
be liable towards the Tristan noteholders with any amounts received from RoK in payment
of the award. According to Stati, it was due to this potential liability that debt was not to be
deducted from their claims. Only if Stati were to be awarded the enterprise value could it
be ensured that, after having paid off the debt to the Tristan noteholders, Stati would be
able keep the value of their equity in KPM and TNG, i.e. the value of their shares of which
they were deprived.

(373) Importantly, Stati never argued and practically admitted that in case no damages were to

be awarded to Ascom and Terra Raf, none of Stati would be liable to the Tristan
noteholders.

Case 1:14-cv-01638-ABJ Document 20-22 Filed 02/26/15 Page 85 of 92

(374) Rok’s primary objection to Stati’ claim for enterprise value was that under their pledges,
Ascom and Terra Raf would not be liable with any eventual amounts under an award.
However, RoK also provided “fall-back” arguments in case the Tribunal were to disagree.

(375) For one, RoK referred to several investment arbitration cases that was considered
comparable and in which it was held that debt had to be deducted from the claim.

(376) Moreover, RoK also argued that Stati’ logic was flawed. Their argument that they needed
to be awarded the enterprise value in order to eventually realise the equity value wrongly
presupposed that there was any equity value to realise. In fact, however, there was no
such equity value. KPM and TNG only had an enterprise value of USD 186 million
(according to RoK’s expert Deloitte GmbH) while the debt stood at more than
USD 559 million. Hence, no debt needed to be added to the equity value in order to make
Stati whole (or, as RoK put it, in order to “gross up” Stati’ claim).

(377) Further, RoK pointed out that in fact, adding debt on top of the equity value would only
serve to pay out the Tristan noteholders. However, if the Tristan noteholders were the real
party in interest, it would be for the Tristan noteholders to bring their own claim rather than
for Stati to serve as a front for the Tristan noteholders’ claim. Otherwise, the Tristan
noteholders would be allowed to circumvent the substantial barriers that their own
investment arbitration claim would face.

(iii) The Tribunal’s ruling

(378) The Tribunal’s ruling failed to respond to the legal arguments raised by the Parties. The
ruling is defective because it is based in its entirety on an alleged admission by RoK that
was never made. Thus, the Tribunal failed to take into account numerous important
arguments raised by RoK. This constitutes a clear violation of Rok’s right to be heard.

(379) As a starting point, the Tribunal found that in principle, it is possible to deduct debt from
the amount of damages claimed by Stati. It held that Stati “should not be compensated for
any debts for which they now are no longer liable and for which Respondent, or the new
owner to which the assets were transferred, is now solely liable.”*°

(380) Turning to the Tristan debt in particular, the Tribunal stated that RoK had “expressly
agreed in its Rejoinder on Quantum (R-IIl J 383) that, insofar as Claimants remain
responsible for the Tristan debt, enterprise value is the correct measure of damages.”*"° It
went on to state: “While Respondent's statement at the May 2013 Hearing may perhaps
be understood as changing that position, it did not attempt to reconcile its prior statement
and the Tribunal still agrees with Respondent's earlier position.’*"'

(383)

(384)

(385)

In the following, the Tribunal determined that under Ascom and Terra Raf pledges, Stati
continue to be liable towards the Tristan Noteholders with the amount due under the
award.*" As a result, the Tribunal declined to deduct the Tristan debt from the enterprise
values claimed by Stati. No further reasoning was given.

The Tribunal was entirely wrong to treat the question of debt as admitted by RoK.
Paragraph 383 of the Rejoinder on Quantum referenced by the Tribunal does not contain
any admission. In this paragraph, RoK merely addressed a hypothetical situation, without
submitting a specific admission.

In any event, even if the Court should find that the Rejoinder on Quantum contained such
admission (Which RoK denies), there is no ground for RoK to be bound by it.

As a consequence, RoK was at liberty to “take back” its alleged “admission” and it clearly
did so. Already at the Hearing on Quantum, RoK introduced one of the alternative
arguments outlined above and stated that ‘ijn any event, even if one assumed that an
award in these proceedings would be subject to claims of the noteholders, claimants are
not entitled to damages [...]’°'* Moreover, in both its 1°‘ and 2" Post-hearing Briefs and at
the May 2013 hearing, it reiterated that the lack of liability under the pledges was only one
of several arguments and that even if this argument were not convincing to the Tribunal,
Stati’ claim had to fail for other reasons.*"*

The Tribunal completely ignored all of these statements. Instead, it merely formulated the
following: “While Respondent's statement at the May 2013 Hearing may perhaps be
understood as changing that position, it did not attempt to reconcile its prior statement and
the Tribunal still agrees with Respondent's earlier position. 1° This statement evidences
that the Tribunal disregarded the arguments advanced by RoK on this issue. For one,
Rok’s closing submission at the May 2013 hearing could not “perhaps be understood as
changing that position”, it was clear, unambiguous and beyond doubt different from the
“position” the Tribunal now reads into paragraph 383 of the Rejoinder on Quantum.
Moreover, the Tribunal could not simply limit its review of RoK’s pleadings to the
May 2013 hearing. Rather, it also had to look at the Hearing on Quantum, and both Post-
hearing Briefs. Had it done so, it could not have been in any doubt as to the true position
of RoK. The Tribunal’s failure to do so is clearly documented in its own reasoning in
paragraph 1536 of the Award. This failure constitutes a procedural irregularity mandating
the setting aside of the Award.

(iv) Challenge grounds under Article 34 SAA

The above identified error allows for a further challenge under SAA Article 34 item 2 and
6. The Tribunal’s decision to hold RoK to its alleged concession constitutes an excess of
mandate and a procedural irregularity.

A tribunal is not allowed to base its awards on concessions never made by a party.
Although the principle of free evaluation of evidence is predominant under Swedish
procedural law and Swedish arbitration law, this freedom of the tribunal has its limitations.
In particular, it is the duty of a tribunal to evaluate all evidence presented to them.*"®
Hence, the tribunal cannot completely ignore evidence invoked by the parties. However, if
a party has conceded a certain legal fact, the tribunal may base its finding on the
concession, rather than evaluating the evidence relating to such fact. Corollary, should the
Tribunal base its findings on an alleged concession never made by the party, without
evaluating the evidence in this respect, such action will constitute an excess of its
mandate and/or a procedural irregularity.

Moreover, as set out above, Swedish law entitles a party to withdraw a concession made
during the arbitral proceedings. Such withdrawal must be taken into account by the
Tribunal. Hence, if a tribunal will base its determination on a concession that has been
withdrawn, the tribunal will act beyond its mandate and/or commit a procedural irregularity.

Regarding the valuation of Borankol and Tolkyn, the Tribunal incorrectly assumed
that RoK had admitted a certain valuation result to be correct where in fact, RoK
had stated clearly and unambiguously that the valuation result was incorrect and
exaggerated

The Tribunal also went clearly beyond the submissions by the Parties in its valuation
assessment for the Borankol and Tolkyn fields. Here, the Tribunal incorrectly assumed
that certain valuation results had been admitted by RoK. In fact, RoK as well as its experts
from Deloitte GmbH had made it clear that it considered the valuation results in question
to be incorrect and overstated.

(i) Factual background and pleadings by the Parties

During the Arbitration, both Parties’ valuation experts valued the Borankol and Tolkyn
fields using the so-called “Discounted Cashflow Method” (“DCF method”). For this method,
future profits expected from the operation of an asset are calculated using certain
assumptions and depreciations based on a discount rate.

Based on the DCF method, Rok’s expert Deloitte GmbH calculated an asset value of
USD 186 million for the Borankol and Tolkyn fields. This result was based on a valuation
date of 21 July 2010 and a reserve estimate for the fields provided by Rok’s reserves
experts Gaffney Cline & Associates (GCA).

(392) On the other hand, Stati’ experts FTI ultimately calculated the DCF value for both fields to
be USD 676 million. FTI arrived at this number using a valuation date of 14 October 2008
and reserve estimates provided by Stati’ reserves experts Ryder Scott.

(393) Both Parties’ experts tried to support their own DCF valuation and to undermine the
opposing experts’ DCF valuation by means of a so-called “Comparable Companies” and
“Comparable Transaction” Analysis (both together forming the so-called “Comparables
Analysis’).?"”

(394) FTI submitted that their comparable companies analysis for Borankol and Tolkyn as of the
Defendant's valuation date of 14 October 2008 and based on Ryder Scott reserves
estimates had rendered a value of USD 682million’'® and that their comparable
transactions analysis for these assets and this date had led to a value ranging between
USD 667 million and USD 682 million.?"° Deloitte GmbH also provided a Comparables
Analysis for Stati’ valuation date of 14 October 2008 based on the Reserves Estimates
prepared by Stati’ reserves expert Ryder Scott. Deloitte GmbH’s Comparable Companies
Analysis based on this date and this data led to a combined value for Borankol and Tolkyn
of USD 169.6 million”? whereas the comparable transactions analysis rendered a result
of USD 277.8 million.”'Both experts highlighted that they did not consider the
Comparables Analysis to replace or supersede the DCF valuation or to even be of the
same relevance as the DCF valuation. They clearly stated that the Comparables Analysis
only served to “assess the reasonability” of the DCF valuation”? or to “support” the DCF

"7 Practically, the Comparables Analysis worked as follows: First, the valuation experts determined certain publicly traded
companies and certain publicly known transactions for which they considered the assets at issue to be comparable to the
Borankol and Tolkyn fields. Second, they determined so-called “multiples”, meaning that they calculated a ratio of the value
of the company or transaction in relation to the volume of reserves subject to the deal. The value of a publicly traded
company was calculated as the sum of the value of all of its shares. The value of a transaction was taken from publicly
available records, as was done with regard to the volume of reserves. The multiple of the comparable companies or
transactions thus is an expression of how much value could be realised for a company controlling a certain volume of oil and
gas reserves. Specifically, the Comparables Analysis was based on so-called 2P reserves estimates, i.e. the proven and
probable reserves of an operating oil and gas field.

Third, the experts looked at all the multiples determined for the individual comparable companies and comparable
transactions and calculated an average or median multiple based thereon. Fourth and finally, the experts applied this
multiple to the 2P Reserve Estimates prepared for Borankol and Tolkyn by the Parties’ respective reserves experts GCA and
Ryder Scott. Importantly, the 2P Reserve Estimates for oil and gas were combined into one number by converting the gas
reserves estimates which had been given by the reserves experts in cubic feet or cubic meters into the unit “barrel of oil
equivalent” (boe). The barrel estimates for oil and the boe estimates for gas are then simply added together. The final
calculations were hence simple multiplications of the average/median comparable transactions multiple and the
average/median comparable companies multiple with the 2P reserve estimates in boe. Cf. also 1% FTI, paras. 14.1-14.18,

valuation*® and that they did not “feel [the Comparables Analysis] may be appropriate as

the primary valuation indicator’.

(395) RoK also made clear that the numbers arrived at by Deloitte GmbH were not provided as
a valuation but in order to show that FTI’s valuation is an “outlier” that is not to be
trusted.”

(396) At the end of its Comparables Analysis for the 2008 date and the Ryder Scott reserve
estimates, Deloitte GmbH also clearly stated that it considered the results it had arrived at
to still be overstated. That was because Borankol and Tolkyn taken together have a much
higher gas ratio than the fields that were considered among the comparable companies
and comparable transactions. Gas can only be sold for a lower price than oil, which the
Comparables Analysis conducted had not taken into account.”* Deloitte GmbH concluded
that

“the EV/2P multiple [...] for oil fields should be adjusted downwards to
make it applicable to Borankol and Tolkyn fields. weer

(397) However, since the calculations were only done for illustrative purposes and since these
purposes were already fulfilled without possible further downward adjustments,
Deloitte GmbH did not attempt to provide a further adjusted calculation.

(398) Importantly, RoK referred very clearly to Deloitte GmbH’s submission when referring to the
Deloitte GmbH Comparables Analysis.’ Moreover, in its rebuttal closing presentation at
the May 2013 hearing, RoK also made reference to the fact that in the present case, any
Comparables Analysis leads to an overstatement of values, given that the gas ratio in the
Borankol and Tolkyn fields is higher than in the comparable companies and
transactions.”“° In that context, RoK also referred to an internal valuation document of
KMG EP in which this limitation of the Comparables Analysis was mentioned. Therein, it
was mentioned as one limitation of a Comparables Analysis with regard to Borankol and
Tolkyn that the

“Bulk of comparable deals are pertinent to the crude oil reserves,
while gas portion in estimated reserves in BOE is over 60% (on
account of Tolkyn field)’."°°

(ii) The Tribunal’s ruling

In its considerations on the value of Borankol and Tolkyn, the Tribunal found that Ryder
Scott's reports on reserves estimates as of 14 October 2008 were convincing.”*’ The
Tribunal went on to state that RoK had “conceded” Deloitte GmbH’s Comparables
Analysis based on the 2008 valuation date and the Ryder Scott data in case Rok’s
valuation date is not accepted.*** In conclusion, the Tribunal relied on Deloitte GmbH’s
comparable transactions calculation with a result of USD 277.8 million without making any
reference to the comparable companies calculation of USD 169.6 million.”

By reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal treated a fact as admitted that was clearly and
demonstrably not admitted. Contrary to the Tribunal’s statement, RoK never conceded the
comparable transaction calculation for 2008 and the Ryder Scott numbers to be the
correct valuation for the 2008 valuation date. In fact, RoK and Deloitte GmbH had both
clearly stated that the calculation was incorrect because the high gas ratio in Borankol and
Tolkyn requiring the downward adjustment had not been taken into account. Moreover
and in any event, the comparable transaction analysis had only been provided for
illustrative purposes.

(iii) Challenge grounds under Article 34 SAA

Due to the errors identified above, the Award must be set aside both under SAA
Article 34 item 2 and item 6 SAA.

A tribunal exceeds its mandate if it considers facts conceded that were never conceded.
Such mistake is further aggravated where, as in the present case, a tribunal considers
facts as conceded even though they had been expressly contested. RoK had expressly
stated that the comparable transactions valuation was overstated, meaning that the
Tribunal could not consider this valuation as being admitted. Hence, there can be no
doubt that the Tribunal exceeded its mandate.

In addition, the Tribunal’s ruling constitutes a serious violation of due process.***

(iv) The Tribunal's errors fulfil the necessary causal link required under
Article 34 SAA

The errors outlined had a sufficient influence on the outcome of the case to warrant the
setting aside of the Award.

than Rok’s valuation date of 21 July 2010.

(405) In the event that the Court would conclude that each one of the errors presented above
would not have influenced the Tribunal’s findings, the Court should consider these errors
as a totality. At least taken together, there can be no doubt that these errors influenced
the outcome of the case.

6 STATEMENT OF EVIDENCE

(406) RoK respectfully asks the Court of Appeal to grant a respite for the submission of the
Statement of Evidence until Stati has submitted its Statement of Defence or to a later date
which the Court of Appeal decides.

(407) In order to avoid to burden this Summons Application, RoK has chosen not to include all
documents to which references are made, in particular in the footnotes. RoK will submit
such documents when it is clear which of these that may be relevant for the Court of
Appeal’s understanding and adjudication of the case.
