4, Pursuant to the terms of appointment signed by the Parties and the Tribunal, the Permanent Court

Pulkowski, Senior Legal Counsel, serves as Tribunal Secretary. The address of the PCA is Peace

Cc. THE DISPUTE

5. The Claimant alleges that the Respondent, by its acts and omissions, breached various provisions
of the Agreement between the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the
Government of the Czech and Slovak Republic (together, the “Contracting States”) on
encc and recip I p of i signed on 29 April 1991 and entered

into force on 1 October 1992 (the “Treaty”).' In 1992, the Czech Republic succeeded to the

 

Czechoslovak Republic, in respect of the Treaty. The Czech Republic has been recognized by the
Kingdom of the Netherlands as an independent sovereign State as of | January 1993.7

6. The Claimant requests, among other things, damages provisionally quantified at

CZK 2,438,178,229.

7. According to the Claimant, between 2007 and 2011, it invested over CZK 3 billion in the form of
loans into the Czech Republic, to finance in particular the purchase of poppy seed. These loans
were granted pursuant to an agreement with three individuals who had approached the Claimant

with a business opportunity in the poppy seed market.

Exhibit C-1, A ton and reciprocal of i between the Kingdom
of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, 29 April 1991.

See the website of the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the bilateral relations between the Czech
Republic and the Netherlands:

PCA 295083 8

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award
29 April 2021

According to the Claimant, however, a majority of these loans was not reimbursed, as the business
opportunity was revealed to be a fraud, implemented by those individuals who had approached

the Claimant. Consequently, the Claimant filed criminal complaints in 2012.

On 25 January 2017, the Czech courts issued a first instance judgment condemning the three
individuals who had approached the Claimant.’ This judgment was confirmed on 9 November

2017 by the High Court in Prague.*

The Claimant contends that the five-year delay between its criminal complaint and the issuance
of the judgments represents an “unreasonable delay [... that] reduced the chance that (any of) the
funds invested by Fynerdale could be recovered.”* In comparison, it claims that the same sort of
facts were dealt with in a much speedier fashion in an almost identical case where the victim was
a Czech company.° The Claimant thus argues that the Czech Republic breached its obligations
under the Treaty.

The Respondent in response considers that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims,

 

 

because (i) there is no valid arbitration following the ion of the Czech Republi
to the European Union (the “EU”), as shown and confirmed by the decision of the Court of Justice
of the European Union (the “Court of Justice” or “CJEU”) in the case Slovak Republic v.
Achmea B.V. (Case C-284/16) (the “Achmea Judgment”) and (ii) the investment was made in
breach of Czech law, as evidenced by a judgment of the Swiss Supreme Court convicting inter
alia the Claimant’s ultimate beneficial owners for fraud. In any event, the Respondent argues, the

Claimant’s case is without merit.

BASIS OF THE ARBITRATION

The Claimant bases the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on Article 8 of the Treaty, which reads:

1) Alll disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled amicably.

2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph (1)
of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a
period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested amicable
settlement.

3) The arbitral tribunal referred to in paragraph (2) of this Article will be constituted for
each individual case in the following way: each party to the dispute appoints one member

of the tribunal and the two members thus appointed shall select a national of a third State
as Chairman of the tribunal. Each party to the dispute shall appoint its member of the
tribunal within two months, and the Chairman shall be appointed within three months from
the date on which the investor has notified the other Contracting Party of his decision to
submit the dispute to the arbitral tribunal.

4) If the appointments have not been made in the above mentioned periods, either party to
the dispute may invite the President of the Arbitration Institute of the Chamber of
Commerce of Stockholm to make the necessary appointments. If the President is a national
of either Contracting Party or if he is otherwise prevented from discharging the said
function, the Vice-President shall be invited to make the necessary appointments. If the
Vice-President is a national of either Contracting Party or if he too is prevented from
discharging the said function, the most senior member of the Arbitration Institute who is
not a national of either Contracting Party shall be invited to make the necessary
appointments.

5) The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the arbitration rules
of the United Nations Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

 

6) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular
though not exclusively:

© the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

© the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements between the
Contracting Parties;

© the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;
© the general principles of international law.

7) The tribunal takes its decision by majority of votes; such decision shall be final and
binding upon the parties to the dispute.

SCOPE OF THE AWARD

As recorded by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 1 dated 25 September 2018, the Parties
agreed that the present proceedings should be bifurcated in two phases, one dedicated to the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections and the second, if the Tribunal were to find jurisdiction,

dedicated to the merits of the case and quantum.

The present award addresses only the Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in

this arbitration.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY
COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION

On 19 December 2017, the Claimant commenced this arbitration by serving a Notice of

Arbitration (the “Notice of Arbitration”) on the Respondent, invoking Article 8 of the Treaty

PCA 295083 10

20.

21.

22.

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award
29 April 2021

and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law of 1976
(the “UNCITRAL Rules”). In the Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant also notified the

Respondent that it appointed Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuiia as the first arbitrator.

Further to discussions between the Parties and the Tribunal between May and September 2018,
the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, setting out the procedural framework for the
arbitration in further detail, on 25 September 2018. In Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal inter
alia noted and confirmed the Parties’ selection of The Hague, the Netherlands, as seat of the

arbitration.

Pursuant to the Procedural Calendar set out in Annex | to Procedural Order No. |, the proceedings
were bifurcated in jurisdictional and merits stages, with document production phases at both

stages.

Having been informed on 3 October 2018 by the PCA, writing at the request of the President of
the Tribunal, of Professor Orrego Vicufia’s passing on 2 October 2018, the Claimant was invited
to appoint a substitute arbitrator in accordance with Articles 7 and 13 of the UNCITRAL Rules.
On 16 October 2018, the Claimant appointed Dr. Kiihn.

On 30 November 2018, the PCA circulated the terms of appointment signed by the Parties and

each member of the Tribunal.

On 15 November 2018, the Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim on Jurisdiction and
Liability (the “Statement of Claim”) accompanied by the witness statement CWS-1 of Ms.
 ¢:¢ G Statement”). On 22 November 2018, the PCA
received a complete electronic copy of these documents together with exhibits C-1 to C-24 and

legal authorities CLA-1 to CLA-109.

The Respondent submitted its Submission on Jurisdiction (the “Submission on Jurisdiction”) on
14 February 2019. The Respondent’s Submission on Jurisdiction was accompanied by exhibits

R-1 to R-14 and legal authorities RLA-1 to RLA-64.

On 29 April 2019, the Claimant submitted its Answer on Jurisdiction (the “Answer’)

accompanied by the witness statement CWS-2 of Mr. fF (the ;

Statement”) and exhibits C-25 to C-49 and legal authorities CLA-110 to CLA-148.

FIRST DOCUMENT PRODUCTION PHASE

On 18 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 relating to the production of
documents, ordering the Claimant to produce a series of documents requested by the Respondent
and to produce by 8 August 2019 proof of its best efforts to seek documents held by a number of

third parties, namely Mr Mr as well as the companies Camra, Virium,

Appian Group 2 and Appian Services (Cyprus) Ltd.

On 8 August 2019, the Claimant produced some of the documents whose production had been
ordered and submitted a Report Regarding Document Production on Jurisdiction indicating inter
alia that it had reached out to Mr. Mr. and the above-cited companies by letter on
5 August 2019 and further called Nia | and Mr. on 7 and 8 August respectively. The
Claimant further produced the replies issued by Mr. and Mr. | | indicating that the

requested production of documents would take up to four months.

On 28 August 2019, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal alleging that the Claimant had belatedly
sought the cooperation of third parties and arguing that the delayed production of documents
would result in procedural unfairness. The Respondent thus requested that the Claimant either be
barred from submitting any further documents resulting from document production with its
Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, or be ordered to produce all of the remaining documents in the
possession of Mr. and Mr. within a short deadline, while granting a postponement

for the submission of the Respondent’s Reply on Jurisdiction.
On 30 August 2019, the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to:

1) Make immediate contact with Mr. and Mr. =. as well as the legal
representatives of Camra, Virium, Appian Group 2, and Appian Services (Cyprus)
Ltd.;

2

Request their urgent assistance in locating and producing, by 13 September 2019, any
further documents falling within the categories whose production the Tribunal has
ordered in Procedural Order No. 2; and

 

we

File, by the same date, a Supplementary Report Regarding Document Production on
Jurisdiction, containing a chronology and description of all steps and measures that the
Claimant has undertaken to obtain the documents in question.

The Tribunal further reserved any decision on the procedural timetable.
On 13 September 2019, the Claimant produced some documents whose production was ordered

as well as a Supplementary Report Regarding Document Production on Jurisdiction. The

Claimant separately wrote to the Tribunal to indicate that part of the requested documents would

not be available until 13 November 2019, requesting that it be granted until then to collect and

produce the documents.

On 17 September 2019, the Respondent foreshadowed that it would not be in a position to review
and analyse the newly produced documents in time for its Reply on Jurisdiction, due on 3 October
2019. On 20 September 2019, the Respondent requested an extension of at least fourteen days to
submit its Reply. Furthermore, the Respondent requested that, if the Tribunal were to grant the
Claimant’s request for an extension until 13 November 2019 for the full production of the
documents held by third parties, the deadlines for the second round of submissions be postponed

sine die until the Respondent could review whatever documents were produced then.

On 24 September 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, by which it ordered the
Claimant to produce by 13 November 2019 any further documents within the categories whose
production the Tribunal ordered in Procedural Order No. 2 and which had not been produced until
then, and to document its best efforts to obtain those documents from third parties in a second
supplementary report. The Tribunal further decided to suspend the procedural calendar set out in

Annex | to Procedural Order No. 1.

On 12 November 2019, the Claimant produced further documents whose production had been

ordered, as well as a 'y y Report R ding D Production on

Jurisdiction. In particular, the Claimant indicated that it was producing documents from the Swiss
criminal proceedings instituted against, inter alia, Mr. and Mr in 2012, and further

to contacts with specific people the Claimant had been ordered to reach out to.

On 19 November 2019, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal indicating that it considered the
Claimant’s document production as of 12 November 2019 to be incomplete and non-compliant
with the Tribunal’s orders. The Respondent announced that it would address this issue and any
related demands in its next submission. On 21 November 2019, the Claimant responded indicating
that it regarded its document production to be complete and in accordance with the Tribunal’s

orders. The Tribunal took due note of the correspondence received from both Parties.
FURTHER WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON JURISDICTION

On 15 November 2019, the Tribunal requested that the Parties consult with each other with a view
to reaching agreement on the remaining procedural steps for the jurisdictional phase of this case,
and in particular the deadlines to be set for the second exchange of memorials on jurisdiction, by

27 November 2019.

On 27 November 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached agreement
regarding the deadlines for the upcoming steps in the jurisdiction phase on the understanding — as
indicated by the Tribunal by e-mail of 4 November 2019 — that the hearings would take place on
28-30 April 2020. These dates were confirmed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 4 of
20 December 2020.

In accordance with the revised procedural calendar set out in Annex I of Procedural Order No. 4,
on 28 January 2020, the Respondent submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction (the “Reply”),

accompanied by the expert report Gc 0Utt~—~i*YCY of K2 Intelligence (the ;

Expert Report”), exhibits R-15 to R-35 and legal authorities RLA-79 to RLA-173.

On 27 March 2020, the Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (the “Rejoinder”) along

with the expert report of Vr of Grant Thornton (the ; Expert Report”), a
witness statement CWS-3 from Mr. fF (the i Statement”), exhibits

C-85 to C-90 and legal authorities CLA-149 to CLA-185. The Claimant further indicated that,
due to the exceptional circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, it had “not been able to access
all the documents that are potentially relevant to its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction or the expert report
submitted with the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.” The Claimant thus “reserve[d] the right - subject
to the Tribunal’s approval - to submit new documents prior to the hearing” and indicated that it
would “make its best efforts not to delay the procedural timetable in this respect and inform the

Tribunal and the Respondent immediately.”

POSTPONEMENT OF THE HEARING ON JURISDICTION SCHEDULED IN APRIL 2020 DUE TO THE
COvID-19 PANDEMIC

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4, the hearing on jurisdiction (the “Hearing”) was scheduled

to take place on 28 to 30 April 2020.

On 11 March 2020, in order to prepare for the upcoming Hearing, the Tribunal communicated to
the Parties a draft of Procedural Order No. 5, addressing certain procedural matters not dealt with
in Procedural Order No. 1, such as the allocation of time, the format of hearing and cross-

examination bundles as well as demonstrative exhibits.

On 30 March 2020, the PCA wrote to the Parties on behalf of the President of the Tribunal to
inform them that, due to the propagation of COVID-19 in Europe and considering the restrictions
on travel and gatherings in the Netherlands, it was unlikely that an in-person hearing could be

held in late April. As such, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consider whether the Hearing could

be held by video-conference, and any amendments of draft Procedural Order No. 5 that may be

required.

On 2 April 2020, the Parties indicated that they considered that it would not be feasible to hold
the Hearing by video-conference, in particular given that witnesses and experts would be cross-
examined during the course of the Hearing. Both Parties thus requested the Tribunal to postpone

the hearing until the fall of 2020.

On 7 April 2020, the Claimant called the Respondent’s expert, Ms. | for cross-
examination, while the Respondent called two of the Claimant’s witnesses — Mr. | | and
vr. —as well as the Claimant’s expert, vei for cross-examination.

The Parties further provided comments on draft Procedural Order No. 5. The Parties indicated
that they had agreed that they would file one round of post-hearing briefs in place of closing
statements, with time and page limits to be agreed between them or to be determined by the
Tribunal at the Hearing. These elements were incorporated in Procedural Order No. 5 dated on
21 April 2020, in which the Tribunal further fixed the dates of the Hearing from 1 to 3 September
2020.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S AMICUS CURIAE APPLICATION

On 8 June 2020, the European Commission filed an application for leave to intervene as amicus
curiae in the current proceedings (the “Application”). In its Application, the European

Commission explained:

Articles 267 and 344 [... of the Treaty on Functioning of European Union] must be
interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between
Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal
protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech
and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member
States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State,
bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose
jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.

Following the Achmea judgment, the European Commission decided to request leave to
intervene in all pending intra-EU arbitration proceedings.

The European Commission thus requested the Tribunal to (i) grant the Commission leave to
intervene in the present proceedings; (ii) accept the written amicus curiae submission attached to
the present request, or set a deadline for the Commission to file such a submission; and (iii) allow
the Commission to attend hearings in order to present oral argument and reply to the questions of

the Tribunal at those hearings, should the Tribunal and the parties deem that useful.

On 3 July 2020, the Parties submitted their comments on the Application. The Claimant argued

that the Tribunal should reject it, while the Respondent supported its admission.

On 16 July 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, accepting the European
Commission’s amicus curiae brief into the record of the arbitration on the basis that, without
prejudice to the Tribunal’s views as to any positions stated in that brief, the Tribunal considered
that the European Commission may have a distinct perspective pertaining to the jurisdictional
phase of the arbitration. The Tribunal rejected the European Commission’s request to attend

hearings in order to present oral argument.

REQUEST FOR SUBMISSION OF DOCUMENTS BY THE CLAIMANT BEFORE THE HEARING

Referring to an “ease of some Covid-19 restrictions”, the Claimant informed the Respondent and
the Tribunal on 20 August 2020 that it had been able to access some additional documents that
turned out to be relevant for substantiating its position, enclosing seven new exhibits. The
Claimant stated that it believed that the documents were submitted timely enough for the

Respondent to take these into account in its preparation for the Hearing.

On 24 August 2020, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to reject the proposed new exhibits
as belated, arguing that (i) the Claimant had failed to explain which “restrictions” kept it from
accessing these documents earlier, (ii) the Claimant did not state which measures had been eased,
and how this allowed any person to access these documents now, as opposed to weeks or even
months earlier, and (iii) the timing of the submission did not leave the Respondent sufficient time
to comment and submit counter-evidence as the Respondent is entitled to under paragraph 6.4 of

Procedural Order No. 1.

On 28 August 2020, the Claimant provided additional explanation in support of its application to
admit the new exhibits into the record, and on 31 August 2020, the Respondent elaborated on the

reasons for its request to deny the Claimant’s request.

Having heard the Parties on the issue during the first day of the hearing on | September 2020, the
Tribunal ruled that the seven new exhibits submitted by the Claimant were inadmissible as the

Claimant had been unable to provide sufficient justification for their late submission.

HEARING

The Hearing took place as scheduled between | and 3 September 2020 at the Peace Palace in The
Hague. In light of the travel restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, some participants

attended by video-conference.
The Hearing was attended by:

(a) The Tribunal: Professor Dr. Dr. h.c. Wolfrum, Dr. Kiihn, and Professor Boisson de

Chazournes;

(b) For the Claimant: Ms Dr. i. Ms. and Prof. Dr.

representatives;

(c) For the Respondent: Dr. Dr. Mr Mr and Ms

| | as counsel; Mr. Landa, Ms. Matejova, Ms. Bilanova, and Mr. Kudrna as Party

representatives;

(d) For the Permanent Court of Arbitration, Dr. Pulkowski and Ms. Andrea Lapunzina

Veronelli (by video-conference).

(e) Mr. and Mr. (by video-conference) as witnesses;
(f) Ms. (by video-conference) and Mr. i as experts.

The first day of the Hearing was dedicated to the Parties’ opening statements. During the second

day of the Hearing, the Parties’ experts, Ms. and Mr. testified before the
Tribunal. On the third day of the hearing, Mr. I and Mr. I testified as witnesses
before the Tribunal.

At the end of the Hearing, on 3 September 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consult with

each other in respect of the contents and format of their post-hearing briefs.

In response, counsel informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to submit their post-hearing
briefs by 23 October 2020. The Parties further agreed that “[nJew factual exhibits may be
submitted on the questions posed to the parties today [i.e. on Day 3], not on any other issues.” In

contrast, the Parties agreed that they could “re-address issues such as the Achmea objection, the

illegality objection and [... could] also there discuss and digest the answers given to questions of
the Tribunal to the witnesses, but on those points, no new factual exhibits will be submitted.”*

The Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreement.
PoOsT-HEARING PHASE

On 23 October 2020, both Parties submitted post-hearing briefs, enclosing a limited number of

factual and legal exhibits.

On 30 October 2020, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting it “to reject Exhibits R-36, R-
37 and R-42, as well as the arguments made on the basis of these Exhibits, as belated and contrary
to the express instructions of the Tribunal,” arguing that the new documents did not relate to

questions asked by the Tribunal on Day 3 of the Hearing.

On 3 November 2020, the Respondent opposed the Claimant’s request, arguing that those exhibits
“pertain to questions asked by the Tribunal on Day 3 of the Hearing,” that “the Tribunal at the
Hearing explicitly asked about the status of the criminal proceedings,” and that the exhibits are

significant “to clarify that statements made by Claimant in its Post Hearing Brief are false.”

On 11 November 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, in which it admitted Exhibits
R-36 and R-37 into the record without prejudice to the Tribunal’s views as to their relevance and
materiality or the probative weight to be given to them, and invited the Claimant to provide
comments on these documents by 20 November 2020. The Tribunal further ruled that Exhibit R-
42 was inadmissible and, consequently, both the exhibit and all references to its content would be

disregarded by the Tribunal.

On 19 November 2020, the Claimant, on behalf of both Parties, informed the Tribunal that the
Parties had agreed to submit a second round of post-hearing briefs, limited to 35 pages, by
13 January 2021. Further to the Parties’ agreement, this second round of post-hearing briefs was
to be limited to responding to the arguments raised in the first post-hearing briefs with respect to
the jurisdictional objections of illegality and the indirect investment, with a focus on the newly
submitted (factual) exhibits regarding these two jurisdictional objections. The Claimant
additionally requested that it be allowed to provide comments on Exhibits R-36 and R-37 in its

second post-hearing brief.

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award
29 April 2021

On 20 November 2020, the Tribunal, after receiving confirmation from the Respondent of the
Parties’ agreement on 19 November 2020, noted the Parties’ agreement and granted the

Claimant’s request to comment on the abovementioned exhibits.

On 12 and 13 January 2021, the Parties exchanged their second post-hearing briefs.

On 26 January 2021, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, indicating that the Claimant had made
“at least two new arguments in its submission and thereby disadvantaged Respondent which now
lacks an opportunity to make a rebuttal.” The Respondent thus considered that the Claimant’s
arguments that the Respondent cannot rely on the illegality defence due to (i) corruption of a
Czech official involved and (ii) the discontinuance of local Czech proceedings against the
Claimant’s UBOs in view of the lack of evidence were new arguments. Consequently, the
Respondent requested that the Tribunal either dismiss these arguments as belated or authorize the

Respondent to answer in a brief, two-page submission.

On the same date, upon the Tribunal’s invitation, the Claimant replied that it was “obvious that a
party may make new statements in a second PHB if they respond to arguments raised (for the first
time) by the other party in the first PHB”, as it alleged was the case here. Noting that the Parties
had exchanged a total of eight submissions at this stage, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal

deny the Respondent’s request and proceed with the issuance of the award on jurisdiction.

On | February 2021, the Tribunal adopted Procedural Order No. 9, indicating that, at the present
stage, the Tribunal considered that no further submissions from the Parties were necessary or
appropriate. The Tribunal stated that it would consider the admissibility of the Claimant’s
arguments in the context of its deliberations on the Respondent’s objections to the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.

Having regard to the Parties’ views, including the correspondence exchanged on 26 January 2021,
the Tribunal now concludes that Procedural Order No. 1, in paras 6.3 and 6.4, limits only the
ability of the Parties to adduce belated evidence. Procedural Order No. 1 does not exclude,
however, that new arguments can be made. The Tribunal notes that the discontinuation of the
Czech proceedings is not a new fact. What is new is only the Claimant’s legal argument that the
Respondent’s defence should therefore precluded. Equally, the possibility of Czech officials
having been involved in the bribery is not a new fact in itself although it was not specified earlier.
Therefore, both objections are technically not covered by Procedural Order No. 1, paras 6.3 and

6.4.

29 April 2021

66. However, in the interest of procedural fairness, the Tribunal may still use its power under
Article 15 of the UNCITRAL Rules and exclude an argument as belated or to allow a response
thereto, if appropriate. This is not necessary if the Tribunal considers the arguments advanced as
unconvincing in any event. This is the case here and the Tribunal will turn to these two issues

below.’
III. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
A. THE RESPONDENT’S REQUEST
67. In its Submission on Jurisdiction, the Respondent requested the Tribunal:

a) to declare that it lacks jurisdiction to hear Claimant’s claims, and hence to dismiss its
claims;

Claimant’s claims;

c) in either case, to order Claimant to reimburse Respondent for all costs, fees and
expenses incurred in relation to these proceedings."

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

While the facts are overall agreed between the Parties, the Parties’ views differ starkly with regard

to the origins of the funds used by Fynerdale for making its loan-based investments.

Before proceeding to the facts relied upon by the Parties, the Tribunal considers it necessary to

briefly recall the history and corporate structure of Fynerdale as presented by the Parties.
CORPORATE STRUCTURE OF FYNERDALE

Fynerdale is a Dutch company, incorporated in 1993,'° whose “statutory corporate objectives
include the establishing and obtaining of, the taking part in, the working with, the directing of, as
well as the financing of other businesses and the provision and conclusion of loans.”!” Its
immediate shareholder is Appian Services (Cyprus) Ltd, a company incorporated in Cyprus.’* Its
ultimate beneficiary owners are Mr. ia and Mr. (“Fynerdale’s UBOs”), two Czech
nationals.'? Mr. also acted as advisor to Fynerdale.”°

INVESTMENT STRUCTURE OF FYNERDALE

In anticipation of making a loan-based investment in the poppy seed market in the Czech
Republic, Fynerdale created and acquired a series of companies with its business partners,
principally Ms a poppy seed merchant in the Czech Republic, and Newton
Management (“Newton”), a company of which Fynerdale’s UBO Mr. || had previously

been a partner.”

First, Fynerdale, together with Ms. | and Newton, acquired in May 2007 Ytrix, a
Czech company founded in February 2007 that would be the beneficiary of loans granted by

Fynerdale.”* Ms. | held a 95% shareholding in Ytrix, while Newton held 4% and
Legate — a subsidiary of Fynerdale — held 1%. Ytrix’s board of directors comprised Ms.

| herself, Mr. | on behalf of Newton and Mr. i on behalf of

Fynerdale.”*

Second, Fynerdale and Newton established a joint venture through the company Poppyseed.
Poppyseed was incorporated in Malta on 6 June 2007, directly owned by Cypriot company
Masando Ltd, which itself was held by three Czech citizens, including Mr. |] 26
Poppyseed was directed by vas with the assistance of ml
who implemented instructions from the Czech shareholders.”’ In 2010, vr became its
beneficial owner.”* According to the Claimant, “Fynerdale and Newton agreed that ui
would be in charge of the daily control of the investment through Poppyseed, also on behalf of
Fynerdale. As a result, wo communicated with the representatives of Fynerdale.””

The structure described above was chosen “[a]s Mrs. | did not want to be a
shareholder of a foreign company”. Accordingly, “it was agreed that Mrs. | would
perform her share through Ytrix, and Fynerdale and [Newton Management] mainly through

Poppyseed Limited.”*°

The loans would be granted to Ytrix via Poppyseed.*' Poppyseed’s profits would eventually be
used to reimburse the loans, with such profits to be distributed between Fynerdale (*/;) and
Newton (7/7). While legally owned by a third company, Poppyseed was, according to the

Claimant, de facto under Fynerdale’s control.*

In 2010, the shares in Poppyseed were transferred to Breway, another company of which another
third party was the sole shareholder. At this time, according to Mr. J. “it was agreed that

the company Breway would act on Fynerdale’s instructions.”*4 Moreover, “all initial profit

FYNERDALE ENTERS THE POPPY SEED TRADE MARKET

In 2006, following an invitation from Newton, a company in which one of its UBOs had
previously held an interest, Fynerdale decided to pursue a business opportunity in the poppy seed

market,” namely through the grant of loans relating to the financing of poppy seed trade.

That same year, Fynerdale issued a first loan to Newton, which was fully reimbursed in principal

and with the interest.** Following this first positive transaction, Newton introduced Fynerdale to

three individuals, namely is and her husband, Va (together, “the
| and Mr. who were all involved in the poppy seed trade market (together,

the “Poppy Seed Merchants”).*’ Shortly thereafter, Fynerdale decided to become involved in
the business of the poppy seed trade by means of its participation in a holding company,

Poppyseed, and the grant of loans for the acquisition of poppy seed to Poppyseed.
According to the Claimant, the poppy seed trade mechanism was intended to work as follows:
(a) Fynerdale would grant loans to Ytrix either directly or through Poppyseed;

(b) Ytrix would then buy poppy seed from three Czech companies that were all controlled
by the YY and/or Mr. i Agrobyskovice, Bohemia Profiinvest
(“Bohemia”) and Aida Export-Import s.r.o. (“Aida”); the origin of the poppy seeds
themselves was not communicated to Newton and the Claimant, as Ms. |

wished to keep this information undisclosed;*”

(c) Poppyseed would also purchase some poppy seed directly, from one of the three Czech
companies controlled by the and/or Mr. i:

(d) The Czech company — be it Agrobyskovice, Bohemia or Aida — would store, clean, mix

and pack the purchased poppy seed;

(e) Ytrix and Poppyseed would sell the poppy seed (through Poppyseed) to Tadorna, a

company owned by Mr. iz

(f) Tadorna would finally sell the poppy seed to domestic and international buyers.

86. Following the sale, the profits made would finance the refund of the loans granted by Fynerdale,""
through payments by Tadorna, Ytrix or Poppyseed.”” According to vr

The agreement was that Ytrix could only purchase the poppy, with its main customer being
Poppyseed. The agreement with Fynerdale was that the trade would go on for 4 years
(2007-2001) [sic], and then its success rate would be assessed. The principal would be
returned with interest. If this went well, Newton would be paid a commission for getting
involved. There was a potential to carry on.**

87. The profits coming of the sale of poppy seed would be distributed as follows: 40% granted to

Fynerdale, and 30% each for Ms. and Newton. Thus, according to the Claimant,

the intended business model was as follows:

The fact that Fynerdale paid out all nine Loans to either Poppyseed or Ytrix is not in dispute
between the Parties and is furthermore supported, for Loans 4 to 9, by Fynerdale’s bank

statements.*!

According to the | Expert Report, based on the Claimant’s bank accounts and
notwithstanding the facts alleged in the Statement of Claim, Loans 4, 5, 6 and 9 were issued to
Ytrix, possibly through Poppyseed.* The Expert Report reached the same conclusions.
At the Hearing, the Claimant stated that “[t]hree of the nine loans were invested indirectly in the

Czech Republic, namely through the Maltese company Poppyseed”.**
The origin of the funds used to finance such Loans is a matter in dispute.**

By 2009, Fynerdale was repaid in full for Loans 1, 2, 4 and 5.*° Although Loan 3 was still
outstanding, Fynerdale granted four further loans to fund the poppy seed trade. According to the

Claimant, these four last loans — Loans 6, 7, 8, and 9 — also remain outstanding.”

Throughout this period, the Claimant states, there was no reason for it to feel concerned. Indeed,

Ms | and Mr. Newton’s representative in Ytrix, were in regular contact

with each other, notably exchanging business plans.** Mr visited the warehouse “twice

 

or three times a year” and reported his “justified impression that the warehouses were full of
poppy seed.”** At that point, there was no reason to feel concerned. Moreover, one of

Fynerdale’s UBOs, Mr. acted as consultant on the granting of these loans.°!

However, in 2010, Ms informed Fynerdale that Ytrix would not be able to pay back
its current loans due to the slowing down of the economy. At this time, Ms. | also
suggested that Ytrix acquire all available stocks of poppy seed, the price of which had dropped,
in order to sell them later on for a better margin. Fynerdale, allegedly “convinced by what seemed
a reasonable explanation for the non-payment of the loans and a good opportunity to maximize
benefits”, further granted Loan 8.° At the time, Poppyseed’s director, vr understood
this loan as having been granted to Poppyseed by a Dutch bank.

A final loan — Loan 9 — was made in May 2011 to Ytrix, for an additional CZK 50 million, “to

finance the purchase of nut mix.”**

Thus, “between 2007 and 2010 Fynerdale had gradually invested a total of CZK 3,026,000,000
into the poppy seed trade and CZK 50,000,000 into the nut mix trade by way of nine credit
agreements, through Ytrix and Poppyseed.”** This amount was purportedly used to finance the
purchase of over 123,000 tons of poppy seed” — an unrealistic amount according to the witness
testimony of Mr. co-founder and chairman of an association of poppy-seed growers,

traders and university experts.°”
THE ALLEGED FRAUD TO THE DETRIMENT OF THE CLAIMANT

In 2010, “[a]s first problems with the poppy seed trades appeared”, Poppyseed’s shares were
transferred to Breway.®* This, according to Mr. i was decided in addition to the
cancellation of all initial profit sharing agreements, “as it was very likely that we

was acting fraudulently and Fynerdale suffered enormous losses.”

In 2011, Mr. was contacted by the director of Czech company Ravileta (“Ravileta”)
that claimed to have been defrauded by Newton and Fynerdale’s business partners in the poppy
seed market. Immediately before that contact, according to his testimony before the Czech

authorities, Mr. i indicates that Ms. | had asked him for a loan of

CZK 260 million “for solving the business problem with the Ravileta company, with which, as

[he] found out later, Mrs. and Mr. conducted business with poppy seeds

that went against all the agreements, until some problem occurred.””!

In October 2011, the Czech Republic’s Department of Financial Analysis of the Ministry of
Finance (the “FAU”) filed a criminal complaint against — amongst others — Tadorna and Poppy
Trade s.r.o., regarding facts indicating “suspicion that a crime was committed by unknown
persons in connection with transactions carried out in [their] bank accounts”. According to the
Claimant, this led to the uncovering of the fraudulent scheme implemented by the Poppy Seed

Merchants.”

vr then informed Fynerdale’s representative in Ytrix, Mr. and Poppyseed.”*
On 3 November 2011, together, Mr. i and Mr. visited the warehouse where the
merchandise was supposed to be stocked.” This visit was made possible only after Poppyseed

filed a motion to the Czech courts to access the warehouses.”

At a time when Ytrix was supposed to have bought all available stocks of poppy seed on the
Czech market, Mr. | and Mr. i were surprised to notice that the warehouse
contained fewer stocks than expected:”’ according to the notification of facts later handed to the
Czech authorities, whereas 67,000,000 kg of poppy seed were to be held in the warehouse, only
1,500,000 kg — i.e. 2% of the total — were stocked there.” In her testimony, Ms. |

Following discussions with legal counsel and with its business partners, Mr. i decided to
submit a complaint to the Czech police on 26 March 2012, supplemented on 30 March 2012 (the

“Notification of Facts”), indicating that

and. could have created a mechanism together, that
would enable them to abuse the lack of proficiency and experience and the lack of
knowledge of the agricultural commodities market of the other persons involved, and by
this also abuse their trust to ensure their own profit, which resulted in losses of Poppyseed
and Ytrix, respectively Fynerdale as their investor, in the total amount of at least
2,345,000,000 CZK, which is a considerable loss.**

 

In the Notification of Facts, Mr. requested that the Czech Republic’s “police verifies the
aforementioned facts and ensures all necessary evidence, especially the accounting records of
Ytrix that according to the notifier were done vy and also all contracts and

delivery notes kept in the registered office of Ytrix vit) i ms

That same day, Poppyseed also filed a similar complaint.** On 20 August 2012, Fynerdale joined
the proceedings as a damaged party.

PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE CZECH COURTS

Following the Notification of Facts, criminal proceedings were formally initiated on 26 April
2012.*7 At this stage, the Claimant considers that, in accordance with Czech criminal law, the
Notification of Facts ought to have been joined to the criminal proceedings initiated by Ravileta
on 12 December 2011,** given that their claims relied on the same factual background.®’ In her
witness statement, Ms. explains that she was informed that the officers in charge of
both investigations “would cooperate on the matter, and after the commencement of the criminal
prosecution the cases would be merged and in essence there would be an extension of the charges

already reported.”

On 24 July 2012, the Czech police requested Ytrix’s accountants to release certain financial
documents pertaining to the investigation.”' On 27 August 2012, the Czech police issued a
resolution initiating criminal prosecution against Mr. i Ms. | and Mr.
iz (“Resolution no. 1”), which concluded that “[g]iven that the examination of the facts
found clearly indicates that a particularly serious crime of fraud has been committed by the

defendants indicated in the operative part of the resolution, criminal prosecution is justified.”

The Claimant notes that this resolution contained no reference to the financial documents that had

been obtained from Ytrix’s accountant by the Czech police.°?

On 30 August 2012, the Czech police approached local banks requesting account information of
the three prosecuted individuals and their companies.’ On 1 September 2012, counsel for the
YY filed a complaint against Resolution no. 1, resulting in its annulment following the
supervising State Prosecutor’s resolution of 25 September 2012 (the “Prosecutor’s Resolution”).

According to the Prosecutor’s Resolution,

After examina of the lution of initiating ion and the di gathered
by the police before issuing the resolution that illustrate the scope of the facts verified,
which the police used to make the decision, I came to the conclusion that the resolution of
the police is flawed and it is necessary to cancel it even with no regard to the complaint.
The decision of the complaint precedes the right of the state prosecutor to cancel incorrect

and unjustified resolutions of the police, therefore the resolution of initiating prosecution
of the | and is hereby cancelled based on
the complaints of the defendants. It is necessary to agree with this complaint. The police

did not gather enough evidence during the examination and clarification of the facts
suggesting that a crime has been committed, therefore their resolution was at least
premature and it is therefore unjustified.°5

The Prosecutor’s Resolution also found procedural flaws in the proceedings, noting in particular

that the suspects — the and Mr. i —had not been heard and that the alleged

criminal activities had not been properly qualified under law.”

In December 2012, the Czech police sought for the first time the assistance of the Financial and

Analytical Unit of the Ministry of Finance in Fynerdale’s case. Ms indicates in her

statement that, as legal counsel for Fynerdale, she had proposed the police to ask for the

cooperation of this unit much earlier, considering that this unit had assisted in the Ravileta case.”

 

In that case, the Poppy Seed Merchants were found guilty in March 2013.°*

In 2013, the supervising State Prosecutor was changed.” In March 2013, two other complainants
were joined to Fynerdale’s claim. The Claimant alleges that, at this point, it became aware of a
close relationship between the former State Prosecutor and the owner of Ravileta: thanks to this

proximity, Ravileta’s case was concluded without Fynerdale being joined to Ravileta’s claim and

led to the seizure of all known possessions of the Poppy Seed Merchants.'°

Pursuant to the Prosecutor’s Resolution, the Czech police pursued its criminal investigation. On
13 December 2013, it issued a second resolution on the commencement of the criminal
prosecution (“Resolution no. 2”).'°' In Resolution no. 2, the Czech police summarized the

situation as follows:

By mutual agreement with the aim of defrauding the injured company Fynerdale of
money, the defendants issued or ordered the issuance of fictitious invoices, delivery notes
and other fictitious accounting documents, on the basis of which the funds provided by
Fynerdale to YTRIX or Poppyseed were paid to companies AGROBYSKOVICE,
Bohemia Profiinvest and AIDA, which immediately transferred these funds to
TADORNA, which was supposed to use them to purchase poppy from YTRIX and
Poppyseed, which re-used the funds to buy poppy from the above-mentioned companies,
creating a chain of payments that initially created the appearance of successful poppy
trading, which, however, did not actually happen as the poppy was not bought from Czech
growers in the declared amount; it could not, in fact, be bought since Czech production
did not reach the declared level, so the defendants defrauded the injured of at least the
amount representing the difference between the amount that was used or was to be used
by YTRIX and Poppyseed to buy poppy through AGROBYSKOVICE, Bohemia
Profiinvest and AIDA, and the amount that was returned to YTRIX and Poppyseed by
TADORNA and AIDA, amounting to CZK 1,395,001,963.

 

The defendants thus enriched themselves by joint action consisting of misleading others
and causing damage to other’s property to a large extent, amounting to at least CZK
1,395,001,963.'°

Resolution no. 2 further specified:

In the case of the injured companies Fynerdale and Laudible, they have been misled by
the defendants in a sophisticated and long-term manner, so that they believed that the
business was profitable and “profit” from the deals was paid from the new funds provided

by the investor, (a pyramid scheme), therefore everything appeared as a working business
for several years. Each year, however, part of the money was collected from the accounts
of the defendant! companies and probably passed to the defendants

an This became apparent only in 2012 when it
found that the agricultural commodities had never been stored in the declared quantities,
of which all of the defendants had to be aware.!

 
    

On 5 December 2014, the Czech police closed the investigation. On 23 February 2015, the police

re-opened the investigation at the supervising State Prosecutor’s behest.!°*

Throughout this period, Fynerdale’s Czech lawyer, Ms. i. was in constant contact with
the Czech police and provided them detailed financial information to facilitate the

investigation.'°°

Upon the re-opening of the investigation in February 2015,'°° on 5 February 2016, charges were
brought before the Municipal Court in Prague.'”” The and i were indicted

for unlawful enrichment “by misleading someone causing a large-scale damage to the property of
another, while committing such a crime as a member of an organized group”,'”’ thus committing

the offence of fraud.'” At this stage, the Claimant alleges that “no violations of the law were

found in connection with the financial transactions on Fynerdale’s bank account.”!!”

Noting that the poppy seed trade mechanism was disconnected from reality, and that in fact “no
trade was happening or if there was any, it did not reach the declared volume, because the whole
Czech production as such would not have been able to provide the declared volume”,'!' the
Municipal Court of Prague issued a judgment in favour of Fynerdale on 25 January 2017,

considering that:

We can conclude that FYNERDALE had gradually invested CZK 3,076 million into
the trade (the Indictment states it was CZK 3,075.5 million, which must be an error in
calculation of the individual items specified therein), so the Indictment must be adjusted
in the sense that the amount of CZK 2,452.5 million was invested, in a form of loans,
to POPPYSEED, whereas the funds were partly (CZK 1,437.5 million) sent to the
account of POPPYSEED and partly (CZK 1,015 million) to YTRIX. FYNERDALE
further provided a loan of CZK 43 million to AIDA and CZK 94.5 million to YTRIX,

whereas liabilities from these loans were subsequently taken over by POPPYSEED (from
the perspective of YTRIX the liabilities ceased to exist by set-off against the obligation of
POPPYSEED under the agreement dated 11/7/2007). Based on loan agreements made
directly with YTRIX, FYNERDALE further provided CZK 436 million. Analyses of the
relevant accounts correspond to these conclusions —- FYNERDALE sent the total amount
of CZK 1,437,497,000 to POPPYSEED (the difference of CZK 3,000 probably
corresponds to the fees) and the amount of CZK 1,596,500,000 to YTRIX (which
corresponds to the sum of the loans of YTRIX, plus CZK 94.5 million resent via the
account of the law office and the amounts which had to be paid to this account by
POPPYSEED based on the loan agreements) and CZK 43 million to AIDA.

The court therefore considers it proven that the injured FYNERDALE had
gradually invested the amount of CZK 3,076,000,000 into the trade, from which CZK
3,026,000,000 was meant for poppy seed trade and CZK 50,000,000 was meant for
nut mixture trade.'!?

In this decision, the Prague Municipal Court further noted the similarities between the Ravileta

case and Fynerdale’s own situation:

in connection to the RAVILETA case and the deed under charge I the court found very
similar features of the organized group (the same division of tasks, planning,
coordination), whereas the connection of the two deeds as partial deeds implies a higher
degree of stability of the group, which committed the same acts not just towards
FYNERDALE but also towards RAVILETA.'

The Prague High Court mostly upheld the decision on 9 November 2017, rejecting the

|g and Mr. Ds appeals, deciding in particular that “it can be concluded that the

findings of the first instance court were found as corresponding to the content of the evidence

produced by the appellate court and may be referred to in detail.”!'*

SWISS PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FYNERDALE’S ULTIMATE BENEFICIARY OWNERS

The Respondent alleges that the funds used for the poppy seed trade mechanism derives from
criminal activities, namely of money laundering and fraud. In support of its contention, the
Respondent notably relies on criminal proceedings against Fynerdale’s UBOs before the courts
of Switzerland, which culminated, on 22 December 2017, in the Swiss Tribunal fédéral judgment
(the “2017 Swiss Supreme Court Judgment”) upholding a 2013 criminal judgment of the
Tribunal pénal fédéral that had found Fynerdale’s UBOs guilty of fraud and money laundering,

The Claimant denies any wrongdoing on the part of its UBOs. The Claimant further disputes the
correctness of the findings of the Swiss courts. Moreover, the Claimant argues that the funds used
for the investment in the Czech Republic were unrelated to the activities of which the UBOs were

found guilty.

The Respondent acknowledges that Czech authorities, after investigation of the sale of the shares
in MUS, had dismissed allegations that the sale arose from criminal offences in 2001, or that it
was a form of fiscal fraud, in 2008.''® However, this overall scheme led to a criminal procedure

before the Swiss courts. ''”

The Tribunal pénal fed eral thus convicted, amongst others,
Nia | and Mr — Fynerdale’s UBOs — and sentenced them to approximately four years
of imprisonment. The Swiss criminal court also convicted Mr. and sentenced him to a

conditional fine and to a civil fine.''®
1. The Fraudulent Acquisition of MUS by Private Investors

The activities for which Fynerdale’s UBOs were convicted precede by several years the events
underlying the Claimant’s claims in the present arbitration and relate to the privatisation in the
late 1990s of a formally State-owned Czech coal company, Mostecka uhelna spolecnost
(“MUS”).'"° According to the Respondent, relying at length on decisions issued by the Swiss
criminal courts, the Claimant’s UBOs participated in a money-laundering and embezzlement

scheme (the “MUS Fraud”).

MUS was a mining company incorporated in 1993 by the Czech national patrimony fund, a public

According to the 2017 Swiss Supreme Court, Fynerdale’s UBOs, with other accomplices,
participated in the purchase of a majority of shares of MUS, which was paid for by embezzling
of that company’s own funds.'”?

According to the 2017 Swiss Supreme Court Judgment, two companies of the Newton group,
namely Newton Financial Management Group A.S. (“NFMG”) and its daughter company
Newton Stock Investment (“NSI”), indirectly and partly owned by Mr. i. acquired a large
amount of MUS shares.'? Between April 1999 and March 2000, NFMG was transferred to
Camra, a company founded in 1996 on the Isle of Man and indirectly owned by a number of
Czech individuals, including Mr. a.” In 2002, Mr. | acquired an indirect share in

Camra.'?°

In January 1997, NFMG granted a loan of CZK 2.5 billion to MUS, which were destined for the
acquisition of shares in other companies on behalf of and in favour of MUS, without MUS
appearing as buyer.'”° However, only about CZK 447 million were used to that end.” Indeed,
the majority of the remaining sum was transferred to NSI in 85 separate transfers.'?* The Newton

thus acquired with the very amounts that had been entrusted to NFMG to make investments for

the Czech state.'3! To that end, they relied on a separate group of companies, the Appian Group
2. This group of companies drew on the name and reputation of a finance company based on the
United States, Appian Group 1, founded by Mr. fs Sometime after April 1998,
va assigned the Appian trademark to wi who mandated Mr.
|| a former director of the International Monetary Fund and then director of the Appian
Group 1, to administer the Appian Group 2 (“Appian 2”). This homonymy was intentional so as
to maintain confusion between the two groups. Appian 2, however, was nothing but “a structure
of empty shells serving as instruments for its “economic successors, whose circle coincided with
that of Camra and Virium. Some of them have also belonged at one time or another to either the
Camra group or the Virium group.”!?

Indeed, according to the 2017 Swiss Supreme Court Judgment, the idea was to convince the Czech
State that a foreign investor was seeking to make an investment in the Czech Republic by
purchasing the remaining MUS shares owned by the State. However, that was not the case: the
ultimate buyers were indeed the same individuals who had acquired an indirect minority

shareholding in MUS.'?

In order to succeed, Mr. agreed “to appear publicly [...] as the beneficial owner of the
shares held by” the company holding all of the previously bought shares of MUS, Investenergy.'™*
Investenergy is a Swiss company created in March 1997, of which wo is both a shareholder
and the trustee for other shareholders; since October 1998, Investenergy was part of the Camra
group of companies, and Mr. agreed to act only under instructions, on behalf of and for the
sole interest of Camra.'*> Acting as representative of Investenergy, Mr. pretended to act on
behalf of Appian Group | for the purchase of the remaining majority shareholding in MUS, so as

to provide the illusion that a reputable foreign investor was acquiring the shares from the State.'*°

In June 1999, Me indicated to the authorities that the investment group on behalf of which
he was acting now owned over 50% of the MUS shares, and was thus entitled to make a mandatory
offer for the purchase of the remaining shares. In July 1999, Investenergy offered to the State to
purchase the remaining shares for a price 24% higher than the legal price, i.e. CZK 650,000,000,

to be immediately paid.'*’ On 28 July 1999, the Czech Government approved the sale of the
remaining MUS shares for the offered amount of CZK 650,000,000.'*8

On 19 August 1999, Investenergy paid the said amount, which originated in MUS itself. |
Indeed, through a complex mechanism, the individuals involved in the acquisition of a minority
share assigned a company named Portoinvest to MUS. MUS made numerous capital increases to
Portoinvest, which were then transferred to another company of which Camra was the beneficial
owner, the company EERL.'“° EERL then transferred the funds to Investenergy, which in turn
redistributed the amounts to Camra and other companies owned by Camra in order to pay off the

loan granted by MUS to NFMG to pay for the 46,29% of MUS shares.'*!

To summarize, according to the 2017 Swiss Supreme Court:

In_essence, between 8th of December 1998 and 30th of April 2002,
selze million From cash, which they used to return it to 1n repayment

of the loan of 2nd of January 1997 in favour of NFMG, pay the purchase price From
46.29% of MUS shares owned by the Czech Republic and appropriate the balance through
many front companies at their sole profit."

Eventually, between March 1999 and November 2002, EERL acquired MUS shares from
Investenergy, in order to justify EERL’s previous fund transfers to Investenergy.'“? EERL then
sold those shares to a company indirectly owned by Mr. || and Mr. iM

On 11 January 2001, the Bureau of Investigation for the Czech Republic adjourned the motion
submitted in 1999 by the Securities Commission, “suggesting a suspicion that the foreign
company Appian Group may have been misused in order to disguise the real investor in the
purchase of shares” of MUS.'* The Bureau of Investigation thus concluded that “the matter does

not concern suspicion from a criminal offence and it is not appropriate to deal with the matter

otherwise.”'*°

On 12 December 2002, Lezaky — a Czech company, founded in 2001, originally held by MUS
and then transferred to Appian Energy AG, a daughter company of Appian 2 — acquired MUS
from its mother company, notwithstanding the fact that, at that time, MUS’s own equity capital

'47 Ty 2003, after all of MUS’s assets were transferred

was 6,200 times superior to that of Lezaky.
to Lezaky, MUS was dissolved.'** Lezaky was then rebranded Mostecka Uhelna Spoleénost A.s.,

Pravni Nastupce (“MUS 2”).

In March 2005, the indirect shareholders of MUS 2 and of the Camra, Virium and Appian 2 groups
decided to go their separate ways. As such, or. and or. remained shareholders of
the Camra, Virium and Appian 2 groups.'“’ At this stage, the funds in Mr. Hi: and Mr.
i: hands amounted to USD 63,563,200.'*? In May 2005, MUS 2 was dissolved and its assets
were transferred to its then sole shareholder Severoceska. Like Lezaky before it, Severoceska then

changed its name to become Mostecka Uhelna A.S. (“MUS 3”).'*!

Between 2006 and 2007, MUS 3 sold the shares to other companies, outside the original network
of companies. At this stage, “each of the persons involved in the sale of the shares had made
personal profits ranging from CHF 12 million to nearly CHF 400 million.”!” The Swiss Tribunal
pénal fédéral thus reached the conclusion that Mr had made a profit of CHF 207,889,183,
while Mr. Hi made one of CHF 36,707,967. ' According to the Respondent, Fynerdale’s
UBOs in particular “made a profit from these crimes [of] CHF 258,209,000.”!*4

2. Fynerdale’s Ties with the MUS Fraud

events that led to the embezzlement of large sums of money from MUS:

Fynerdale’s UBOs were convicted were eventually used for the loans granted by Fynerdale to
Poppyseed and Ytrix.'® The poppy seed trade scheme set up by the Claimant was part of a larger
effort to launder the money illegally acquired. The scheme, according to the Respondent,

functioned as follows:

(a) Fynerdale received funds acquired through the MUS fraud from its mother company

and provided funds to Ytrix and Poppyseed;

(b) Ytrix and Poppyseed used the funds obtained to proceed with the purchase and sale of
poppy seed; and

of the money.'°!

In particular, relying on the cross-examination of va | the Respondent notes that it has

been “admitted that loans could have been sourced in the MUS fraud."

Further to the freezing
of the relevant account, the Respondent further notes that another account, which financed Loans
4 to 9, was opened. In the Respondent’s view, “[t]his shows that at the time of the freezing, the
funds from MUS were still in the SG account used for funding Loan 3. Because these funds were
no longer available, wy and ur had to establish new channels for financing of the
loans.”'®

The Respondent further considers that Loan 5 is likely to have been at least partially funded by
the MUS fraud.'**

The Claimant, for its part, considers that the Swiss Judgments inaccurately characterized the facts,
having being made under inordinate political pressure from the United States and without proper
evidence.'®* Thus, the Claimant contends that its UBOs were not involved in a money-laundering

enterprise, but interested in a profitable investment:

In the process of privatization after the fall of the Berlin Wall, many state-owned assets
were transferred from the Czech Republic into the hands of private citizen. At that time,
state-owned MUS [was] a slow moving and unprofitable coal company. To a small group
of Czech entrepreneurs, among which were Mr| and vill it however looked
like a great business opportunity. Hence, they bought a large number of MUS shares with
the aim of selling those shares in a large block to a strategic investor and make a profit.

Subsequently, the new management of MUS transformed the company from an old-
fashioned company into a highly profitable modern enter-prise and sold the ownership in
MUS to another investor with a huge profit.'®
Referring to the testimony of Dr. Ing. Miroslav Grégr at the judicial hearing at the Municipal
Court in Prague on 22 February 2019, the Claimant states that the Czech Republic was

unconcerned with the persons to whom it was selling MUS — so long as it could be sold.'*”

Thus, the amounts used to fund the loans granted to Ytrix and to Poppyseed derived not from
illegal activities, but from the revenue made by Claimant’s UBOs through the dividends obtained
thanks to their investment in Skoda Holdings, a company that they held indirectly between 2007
and 2011 through Appian Machinery (Netherlands) B.V. Between 2008 and 2010, Skoda

According to the Respondent, these dividends themselves were acquired from funds derived from
the MUS fraud, and are therefore “merely another layer in (Mr Mr and others’]

money laundering schemes.”'®

CZECH CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AGAINST FYNERDALE

Further to the Tribunal’s question on the status of criminal proceedings in the Czech Republic,
the Respondent indicated that investigations regarding the funds used by the Claimant to make
the alleged investment had been discontinued.'” Over the course of these investigations, both Mr.
|| and Mr. | | testified, providing evidence the Respondent considers to be “in full
contradiction with what was conceded by Claimant in the present proceedings and the available
evidence.” '’! The Respondent considers that this evidence ought to be considered “as an
alternative source of the information, which Claimant failed to provide in the process of document

production.”!”

The Respondent later produced two decisions of the Czech police summarizing their findings.

In February 2016, further to an investigation related to the purchase of shares and debt in Skoda
by various individuals, including the Fynerdale UBOs, “[t]he Czech police concluded that the
evidence unambiguously shows that the flow of funds was intentionally complicated and used
trust companies to conceal the true origin of the funds from MUS” and further “established the
act of concealing the origin of the funds and causality, thus establishing all elements of criminal

liability under Czech law” (the “2016 Czech Decision”).'”

However, the Respondent explains that “[d]espite essentially proving that a crime was committed,

the Czech police ultimately discontinued the investigation” following the Swiss Supreme Court’s

judgment: “the Czech police had to respect the Swiss judgment as res iudicata and in line with

the ne bis in idem doctrine ruled that prosecution is impermissible.”'”4

In December 2018, in a separate decision, the Czech police “concluded that the flow of funds
from the MUS fraud to Claimant was not established and decided to discontinue the proceedings”
(the “2018 Czech Decision”).'” The Parties characterize the significance of this conclusion
differently. The Claimant highlights that, before reaching the conclusion, the Czech police
undertook a variety of actions, including requesting information from the Financial Analytical
Office of the Ministry of Finance, engaging experts and interrogating a number of individuals
allegedly involved in the MUS fraud and in the underlying facts to these proceedings.'”° The

Respondent notes that the 2018 Czech Decision “does not, in any way, equal an acquittal and does

not have any res judicata effect.”'”

JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

The Respondent challenges the existence of an arbitration agreement, considering that the offer

to arbitrate contained in the Treaty is inapplicable as a result of EU law, as confirmed by the

179

CJEU’s Achmea Judgment, '”* the Declarations,'” and the Agreement for the Termination of

Intra-EU Bilateral Investment Treaties, signed on 5 May 2020 (the “Termination

Agreement”).!*°

Alternatively, the Respondent alleges that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the investment
was illegal under the laws of the Czech Republic. Finally, and in any event, the Respondent
challenges the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the claims relating to the loans made through

Poppyseed, a Maltese company allegedly under the control of Fynerdale.

The Claimant disagrees with these arguments and requests the Tribunal to dismiss the
Respondent’s objections. In particular, the Claimant argues that:

the CJEU did not rule in the Achmea case that the BIT was in violation of EU law, nor did

it address this matter. As long as the BIT is in force, arbitral proceedings can be held on

the basis thereof. Indeed, the CJEU ruling concerns the possible lack of competence of the

an /sic] arbitral tribunal constituted under the BIT, not the existence of the arbitration

clause under international law. The Tribunal is, therefore, still empowered to rule on its

own competence, and the Achmea judgment cannot prevent this Arbitration from taking
place.'*!

THE TRIBUNAL’S COMPETENCE-COMPETENCE

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal must satisfy itself of the existence and extent of its

jurisdiction.

The Claimant asserts that the Tribunal is competent to determine its own jurisdiction. In
particular, according to the Claimant, “the Achmea judgment does not prevent the Tribunal in this
Arbitration [...] from ruling on its own competence nor in this Arbitration in general.”'*? The
Respondent does not dispute the competence-competence of the Tribunal. The Tribunal holds it
to be an established principle in international adjudication that the court or tribunal concerned
decides on the basis of the applicable law on the existence as well as the scope of its jurisdiction
(competence-competence). The application of this principle is the guarantor for the independence

of the court or arbitral tribunal concerned.

The Tribunal will now proceed to ascertain whether it has jurisdiction to decide upon the dispute
before it. It will first turn to the arguments advanced by the Respondent, objected to by the
Claimant that, based on EU law as well as on international law, the Treaty has ceased to constitute
a valid basis for bilateral investment arbitration. In a second step, the Tribunal will turn to the
arguments advanced by the Respondent, and again objected to by the Claimant, that Dutch law
would prevent the Tribunal from hearing the dispute. Finally, the Tribunal will consider the
arguments of the Respondent and respective counterarguments of the Claimant as to whether the

Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae.

(the “TFEU”) and the Treaty on the European Union (the “TEU”) (also referred to, together, as
the “EU Treaties”), in accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the
“VCLT”),'* the Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the arbitration

agreement contained in intra-EU BITs is incompatible with European law and thus invalid.'™*

The Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech Republic are both Parties to the VCLT. The
VCLT is widely regarded as reflecting customary international law. Neither Party suggested that
provisions of the VCLT relied upon by either of them are not applicable to the Treaty.

1. Whether the EU Treaties, as Lex Posterior, Preclude the Application of Article 8 of

The Respondent argues that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the present dispute because
Article 8 of the Treaty — the basis for this arbitration — has been superseded by the TFEU and is

no longer applicable.

EU law, considered in its Achmea Judgment that “in investment arbitration, the conclusion of a
treaty is a deliberate legislative step of the member states of the European Union, by which they
deprive the CJEU of the possibility to fully review the application of European law.”'** This, by
itself, should lead the Tribunal to deny jurisdiction as Article 8 of the Treaty is “incompatible
with and precluded by article 267 TFEU.”!*°

As a subsidiary argument, the Respondent contends that the arbitration agreement in Article 8 of
the Treaty is also void pursuant to Article 30(3) VCLT,'*’ as the TFEU and TEU are leges
posteriori to the Treaty. Indeed, when the Treaty entered into force in October 1992, only the
Netherlands was a Member State (since 1958). It is only on 1 May 2004 that the Czech Republic

became a Member State.

Following the Hearing, the Respondent clarified that it had “never alleged that European law per
se has any primacy over international law”'** and that “[t]he reason why EU law takes precedence
over Article 8 of the BIT in the present case is rooted in Article 351 TFEU or — as a subsidiary
rule — Article 30(3) VCLT.”!®?
(a) The Conflict between the Treaty and the EU Treaties is Governed by Article
351 TFEU Primarily, and Article 30 VCLT Subsidiarily
The Respondent first sets out the legal context in which EU law is inscribed. EU law is first
constituted by “a set of multilateral treaties concluded between or acceded to by the Member
States of the European Union.” It is also part of each Member State’s legal order.'*!

Considering that the Tribunal is faced “with a possible conflict of several international treaties”,
it must proceed with an analysis and application of the appropriate conflict rules. In the
Respondent’s view, Article 351 TFEU is the applicable rule, whereas Article 30 VCLT should
apply on a subsidiary basis.

i) Article 351(1) TFEU is the Applicable Conflict Rule
Article 351 TFEU reads:

The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before | January 1958 or,
for acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States
on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the
provisions of the Treaties.

To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the Treaties, the Member State
or States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities
established. Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall,
where appropriate, adopt a common attitude.

In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member States shall take into
account the fact that the advantages accorded under the Treaties by each Member State
form an integral part of the establishment of the Union and are thereby inseparably linked
with the creation of common institutions, the conferring of powers upon them and the
granting of the same advantages by all the other Member States.

Invoking CJEU jurisprudence,'” the Respondent argues that Article 351 TFEU “is an explicit
conflicts clause which provides that any pre-accession treaty between member states is overridden

by EU law, regardless of the subject matter of the treaty, as long as it is incompatible with

‘ 19
community law.”!°

According to the Respondent, Article 351(1) TFEU is applicable to the present circumstances, as
it is applicable in relations between Member States (and not only to treaties in relations to with

third countries).'°* European jurisprudence “establishes clearly that article 351 TFEU also applies

to conflicts between the TFEU and provisions of a treaty concluded between a Member State and
a third state which later acceded to the EU.”!”* In contrast, Article 351(2) does not apply here, as
it “would apply only to situations in which there is a treaty between a member state and a third
state”.'°°

Noting the Claimant’s reliance on the CJEU’s decision in Burgoa,'”” the Respondent underscores
that this case is not comparable to the one at hand.'** Whereas “[a]ll Burgoa would suggest is that
a treaty with a third State is unaffected due to Article 351(1) TFEU and that individuals may,
therefore, still benefit from the provisions of a treaty”, in the present case, the Respondent argues

that Article 351(1) leads to the inapplicability of Article 8.'°

The Respondent considers that Article 351(1) TFEU sets out overall the same test as Article 30
VCLT.”” Under Article 351(1), that test is to determine “whether the provision of the earlier
treaty is compatible with the TFEU/TEU.’”” For the Respondent, incompatibility is the sole issue
being discussed; “there is no need for any assessment of whether the BIT deals with the same
subject matter as TFEU.””” When a provision of a previous treaty is incompatible with those of

a latter treaty, the first provision is no longer inapplicable, as demonstrated by CJEU

203

jurisprudence.” Article 351(1) will thus apply as soon as the treaty is incompatible with the EU

Treaties. In particular, bilateral treaties between Member States cannot trump the application of

EU law.™

The Respondent explains that, pursuant to Article 351(1) TFEU, the provisions of a treaty
concluded with a State that became a Member State that are incompatible with EU law are
automatically inapplicable.?°> This is a result of the conflict between the other treaty and the EU
Treaties, without there being any requirement for the signatory States to terminate that treaty

containing incompatible provisions “to prevent such provisions from being applied.”?°°

The Respondent further argues that this interpretation of Article 351(1) TFEU, based on the
CJEU’s jurisprudence, is binding between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands as parties to

the TFEU (even though it is not directly binding upon the Tribunal).?”

However, the Respondent
contends, EU law is binding on the Tribunal as part of the domestic law of both States party to
the Treaty,”°* pursuant to Article 8(6) of the Treaty which expressly provides that the Tribunal
“shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in particular though not exclusively: the
law in force of the Contracting Party concerned [...].” Similarly, pursuant to the same provision,
the Tribunal shall apply public international law, of which the EU law is a part thereof. As such,
the Tribunal should take into account the interpretation of EU law provided by the CJEU.”
Last, the Respondent underscores that Article 351 TFEU, as “a part of international law and under
the rule of subsidiarity enshrined in Article 30(1) VCLT”, is the solution to the “undisputed
conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and the TFEU/TEU”.””

ii) Article 30 VCLT Applies as a Subsidiary Conflict Rule

Though the Parties agree that Article 30 VCLT is inapplicable, the Respondent contends that the

reasons for this given by the Claimant are ill-founded.”"' According to the Respondent, insofar as

Article 351 TFEU applies, Article 30 VCLT applies only as a subsidiary rule.
Article 30 VCLT provides as follows:

Article 30 — Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations
of States Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject matter shall be
determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as
incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier
treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies
only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one:

(a) as between States Parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3;

(b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of the treaties,
the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual rights and obligations.

5. Paragraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any question of the termination or
suspension of the operation of a treaty under article 60 or to any question of responsibility
which may arise for a State from the conclusion or application of a treaty the provisions
of which are incompatible with its obligations towards another State under another treaty.

In the Respondent’s view, the concept of subject matter “does not mean that the assessment of
two treaties can be limited to their labelling of the subject matter”. To support this argument, the
Respondent refers to the Report of the Study Group of the ILC on Fragmentation of International

Law, which provides:

As pointed out above, the test of whether two treaties deal with the “same subject matter”
is resolved through the assessment of whether the fulfilment of the obligation under one
treaty affects the fulfilment of the obligation of another.?!?

Rather, in the Respondent’s view, the critical question is “if a state would, if it were to adhere to
an obligation under one treaty, thereby fail to comply with another.”?' Such overlap leads to a

conflict that is directly governed by Article 30 VCLT. The subject matter test asks “whether there

is a normative conflict between the provisions of two treaties.”?!*

Even if a stricter approach of the concept of subject matter were adopted, the Respondent argues

that the solution would remain identical:

The subject matter of the TFEU and the TEU is essentially to create a common market
between the state parties. This entails, just as the BIT, various procedural and substantive
rights for investors within this market. The procedural rights, as explained by the ECJ in
Achmea, include the right to submit any dispute to state courts and ultimately the CJEU.
The substantive rights are enshrined in the four freedoms of European law.2!5

In the Respondent’s view, when two treaties contain clauses that cannot be reconciled, such
conflict cannot be addressed — as suggested by the Claimant — by reference to the /ex specialis

rule. Indeed,

The lex specialis rule would be of no help if the [two treaties] could not be simultaneously
applied without breaching the provisions of one of them. The Lex specialis rule would

suggest that because one treaty is specific, adherence to its provisions will not cause a
breach of the more general treaty. However, if this is not possible, the rule does not help.
The reason for this is that the subject-matter test, to which Claimant suggests applying the
lex specialis rule, in fact is a test for the compatibility of two treaties. [...]

  

If [...] one provision confers exclusive jurisdiction upon one body, obviously there is
incompatibility between treaty provisions. In that situation, it is simply not possible to
apply the Jex specialis rule to resolve the conflict. Hence, in cases of an existing and
inevitable incompatibility, the approach to simply state that two treaties do not pertain to
the same subject matter and hence insist there is no incompatibility is flawed.2!°

 

183. The Respondent concludes that there is a clear incompatibility between Article 8 of the Treaty on

the one hand, and Articles 267 and 344 TFEU on the other. This conflict is related to the same

subject matter: “the resolution of disputes arising out of foreign investment.”?!” Whereas Article

8 of the Treaty submits these disputes to arbitration, Articles 267 and 344 TFEU mandatorily

submit them to the jurisdiction of Member States’ domestic courts, which decisions are ultimately

controlled by the CJEU.7!*

184. Article 267 TFEU provides as follows:

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary
rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies of the Union;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State, that court
or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to
give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member
State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or
tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.

If such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State
with regard to a person in custody, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall act
with the minimum of delay.

185. Article 344 TFEU provides, for its part, as follows:

216

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for
therein.

The Respondent challenges the approach of previous arbitral tribunals that have taken the view
that the TFEU and the applicable BIT do not have the same subject matter because of alleged
different objectives or overall standards of protection. Reviewing the award in Marfin Investment
Group Holdings S.A., Alexandros Bakatselos and others v. Cyprus,?!” the Respondent argues that
the tribunal’s argument that the BIT offered different protections than the TFEU “makes no
sense”: “[i]t reviews whether standards comparable to the FET standard or the protection from
expropriation can be found in the TFEU. [...] This however cannot be the right test to determine
the subject-matter of a treaty. Two successive treaties on the very same subject matter could easily
have different treatment standards.”””° According to the Respondent, the tribunal in that case
failed to address the sole key question: “whether the Tribunal considers that there is a conflict
between article 8 of the BIT and articles 267 and 344 TFEU and which weight the Tribunal will
give to the CJEU’s judgment.”””! Thus, the tribunal provided no solution to the issue at hand, i.e.
“a situation in which two treaties, which apply to the same facts, not only call for the application
of different legal rules, but if these rules cannot be applied simultaneously without the breach of
one treaty.”””?
At the Hearing, the Respondent further relied upon the CJEU’s judgment in Mox Plant, where
“the CJEU held that Article 344 not only prevents states from submitting disputes on the
interpretation of the European treaties to other methods of settlement, but also any third treaty to
the extent that the dispute would involve obligations under the Treaties or in the scope of
competence of the EU.” Accordingly, the Respondent notes that the CJEU has exclusive
jurisdiction over disputes regarding rules forming part of the EU legal order, and, as clarified in
Achmea, in matters relative to the fundamental freedoms such as freedom of establishment and
free movement of capital.?**

The Respondent argues that the fact that the EU Treaties did not grant the EU competence in
respect of foreign direct investment until the 2009 Lisbon Treaty “has no effect whatsoever on
the issues raised in this arbitration, i.e. on BITs concluded between Member States.”””> Moreover,

the fact that arbitration represents a unique feature of BITs is irrelevant to the present case: “what

is essential is the incompatibility between the respective provisions of the two treaties, which is

clearly present in the case at hand and even Claimant itself does not seem to negate this.”””°
(b) The Achmea Judgment Supports the Analysis that Article 8 of the Treaty is
Incompatible with EU Law and thus Invalid

The incompatibility in the present case is further confirmed by the Achmea Judgment, which ruled
that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU are incompatible with Article 8 of the Treaty.??’ The Achmea
Judgment, the Respondent maintains, is “of greatest significance for this Tribunal when making

?8 This is all more so the case given the declaratory nature of the

a decision on incompatibility.

judgment, which entails that the interpretation of the TFEU by the CJEU enjoys ex tunc validity.

In its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent proceeded to review in detail the chronology of events
that led to and followed the Achmea judgment.”*” The Respondent thus highlighted that, pursuant
to the German Federal Court’s preliminary question on whether the arbitration agreement
contained in the underlying BIT (i.e. the Treaty at hand in the present case) was governed by EU
law, the CJEU made “clear [...] that EU law invalidates the (Slovak and Czech) State’s offer to

9923

arbitrate.”**! The Respondent thus concludes that “if at the moment Claimant would have

allegedly accepted the offer to arbitrate under article 8 of the BIT, such offer did not exist from
the perspective of EU law and, even if it did (quod non), it could not have been validly

accepted.”
(c) Invalidity of Article 8 is Separate from the Issue of Termination of the Treaty

Finally, the Respondent argues, the invalidity of Article 8 pursuant to the Czech Republic’s

accession to the EU, as supported by the Achmea Judgment, is separate from the issue of the

termination of a treaty. Similarly, the Czech court practice relating to treaties signed by the

VCLT or 351 TFEU is that “article 8 of the BIT is inapplicable since 2004 and therefore cannot

serve as a basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.” The remaining parts of the Treaty may yet

remain valid and effective.

192. The alleged lack of direct horizontal effect has no incidence on the fact that the decision has an
immediate effect not only between Contracting Parties, but also on individuals. As such, “[t]he
horizontal direct effect of a Treaty provision consequently enables individuals to rely on Treaty
provisions in their relations with other individuals and not only in their relations with Member

States.”?5°

(d) Conclusion

193. The Respondent concludes that “[t]he legal consequence of the application of either article 30(3)
VCLT or article 351 TFEU is that the provisions of the treaty [in particular Article 8], which are

incompatible with the latter, cease to be in force.”?°7

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

194. For its part, the Claimant argues that Article 8 of the Treaty remains valid and applicable, and
thus entitles the Tribunal to assume jurisdiction over the present dispute. Indeed, the Treaty
remains valid, as it was not terminated or suspended in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty,

nor in accordance with the provisions of Article 65 VCLT.?**

(a) There is no Conflict between the Treaty and the EU Treaties
i) Article 351 TFEU Does not Apply as a Conflict Rule

195. The Claimant refutes the Respondent’s argument that Article 351 TFEU is an explicit conflict
rule, which implies Article 8 ceases to exist. The Treaty is a pre-accession treaty pursuant to
Article 351(1) TFEU — as such, the rights and obligations arising thereof cannot be affected by
the EU treaties.” While Article 351(1) is indeed a conflict rule, the Claimant argues that it does

not apply to intra-EU treaties, such as the Treaty.”"!

Indeed, as confirmed in arbitral jurisprudence,”

Article 351 cannot be made to apply in the
present case as both Contracting Parties of the Treaty are Member States.’“> The Respondent’s
reliance on the CJEU’s jurisprudence relating to Article 351 is irrelevant for the present Tribunal:
as confirmed by the award in Nextera Energy Global Holdings v . Spain? the Tribunal is not
bound by the decisions of that Court.”*°

Thus, the Claimant considers that it is entitled to rely on the offer to arbitrate in the Treaty, “by

virtue of Article 351(1) TFEU.”

The Claimant further argues that, even if the Tribunal were to find that Article 351 TFEU is
applicable in the present case, it has no bearing on the validity or applicability of Article 8 of the
Treaty.

First, according to the Claimant, Article 351 TFEU cannot affect the rights that the investors could
derive as beneficiaries of the Treaty. This is all the more so the case considering that the agreement

to arbitrate was entered into on 5 November 2015, i.e. before the Achmea Judgment was issued.2“7

Second, while the Claimant agrees that a public international law analysis applies, it concludes
from said application that EU law cannot be relied upon to free the Czech Republic from its
international obligations, and in particular from its consent to arbitration.”“* Indeed, in accordance

with Article 27 VCLT, the Czech Republic cannot rely on EU law to excuse its failure to comply

with the Treaty’s terms, because EU law qualifies as internal law of Member States.”””

Finally, the Claimant argues that Article 351(2) limits the supremacy of EU law “as far as pre-
accession international obligations of Member States are concerned.””*” In contrast, the provision

“does not automatically render provisions of an international agreement that has been found to be

States are the only ones entitled to make it compatible with EU law under Article 351(2) TFEU."
ii) Article 30 VCLT is Inapplicable in the Present Case

Relying on the award in Magyar Farming v. Hungary, the Claimant argues that “the Tribunal is
constituted on the basis of public international law and situated in the international legal order
and, thus, should resolve any potential conflicts between the various international treaties at hand
in accordance with Article 30 and Article 59 VCLT.”?*> Consequently, Article 30 VCLT could
potentially have a role to play. For it to apply, the TFEU and the Treaty must have the same
subject matter and the TFEU must be considered a successive agreement to the Treaty.°**
However, the conditions for Article 30 VCLT to apply — the temporal condition and the subject

matter condition — are not met.’

First, the Claimant contends that the Treaty and the EU Treaties do not have the same subject
matter. The terms “same subject matter” should be interpreted, as originally intended by the

drafters of the VCLT,?* “strictly and should not be held to cover cases where a general treaty

impinged indirectly on the content of a particular provision of an earlier treaty”.”57

Indeed, the TFEU is a “general treaty between all EU Member States, aimed at establishing and
regulating the economic union”, whereas the Treaty provides merely for specific investment
protection between two States.”°* The treaties also have different objectives: the TFEU’s objective
is to create a common market, whereas the Treaty — and investment treaties in general — aim to
provide specific investment protection.” Lastly, they provide different types of substantive

protections: investment treaties afford protections that are not comparable to those granted under

EU law — thus, the arbitral tribunal in Achmea v. Slovak Republic “came to the conclusion that

the protection under investment treaties goes far beyond EU law.”?®

The Claimant contends that “investment arbitration tribunals have consistently held that intra-EU
BITs do not cover the same subject matter as the TFEU”, referring to a number of arbitral awards
to that effect.’°' Contrary to what the Respondent claims, these awards were not issued “almost
exclusively” before the Achmea judgment was rendered — the same approach was followed in the

awards in United Utilities v. Estonia, Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italy and in Greentech

Energy Systems A/S and others v. Italy, all issued after the CJEU issued its judgment.”

Foreign direct investment was not originally within the competences of the EU — this only
occurred after the 2009 Lisbon Treaty. This, the Claimant argues, entails that “it would be difficult

to argue that the EU treaties have the same subject matter — foreign direct investment — as

99263

investment treaties.”**’ The Claimant considers that its view is supported by a consistent arbitral

jurisprudence. Thus, in European American Investment Bank AG (Austria) v. Slovak Republic,

the arbitral tribunal concluded that “to accede to an economic community is simply not the same
as to set up a specific investment protection regime providing for investor-State arbitration”.?™
Contrary to what the Respondent has stated,”** the Claimant argues, “[i]nvestor-State arbitration

is a unique feature of investment treaties and such dispute settlement mechanism is not provided

for under EU law.”?® Both arbitral jurisprudence” and doctrine”** have recognized this as a

defining feature of BITs. Thus, the Treaty and the TFEU cannot be understood to relate to the

same subject matter.”

Second, the Claimant contends that “the TFEU cannot be considered to be successive to the Treaty
only because it entered into force later than the Treaty” — indeed, the provisions which application
is sought by the Respondent have existed since 1958, in the EEC Treaty.’” As such, even if the
Treaty and the TFEU were to relate to the same subject matter, the TFEU — not the Treaty — would

qualify as the earlier treaty.?”!

In any event, the Claimant argues that “the Czech Republic cannot invoke Article 30 VCLT to

claim the invalidity of the Treaty or its Article 8, because Article 30 VCLT simply does not allow

states to terminate their obligations under the previous treaty by concluding a new treaty.”?”

iii) Article 344 TFEU is Inapplicable

Lastly, with regard to the Respondent’s reference to the MOX Plant decision issued by the CJEU,
the Claimant argues that Article 344 TFEU does not apply to the present case, which confronts a
private party with a Member State. Whereas the MOX Plant case opposed two Member States

and was related to provisions of an international treaty whose content was also covered by EU

directives, the Claimant in the present case is not relying on EU law.?

(b) The Achmea Judgment is Irrelevant to the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction

The Claimant contends that the CJEU’s Achmea Judgment is irrelevant to the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction, because “the Tribunal must base its jurisdiction on (sources of) public international
law — in this case specifically on the Treaty and the VCLT — and not on EU law”,?”° whereas the
Achmea Judgment is solely based on EU law.”” In fact, in its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant

notes that “up to date all the tribunals dealing with similar objections have systematically denied

these objections”.?”*

The Claimant points out that EU law, as determined by the CJEU, is a new legal order distinct
from international law.?” In the Claimant’s view, “in order to determine whether Article 8 of the
Treaty is indeed precluded by the EU Treaties, it does not suffice to only interpret the EU

Treaties.”’*° EU law also cannot set aside public international law, as found by the tribunal in

Eskosol v. Italy2*'

place, nor does the CJEU have the power, to impose definitively how the potential conflict
between EU law and BITs must be resolved.?** Similarly, the Claimant notes that the tribunal in
GPF y. Poland “confirmed that claimant’s right to arbitrate disputes arising out of the BIT does
not conflict with the CJEU’s power to resolve disputes related to the EU Treaties.””*°
Furthermore, the Claimant argues that the decision of a court cannot invalidate an international
treaty.?*° The Respondent has not provided any evidence as to how EU law could “have the effect
of validly withdrawing its consent to arbitration with retroactive effect.”?*’ In any event, the
Treaty protects the legitimate expectations of investors, which can also relate to the application
of the Treaty’s sunset clause: the expectations of investors “would be frustrated if EU law denied
such rights to investors without replacing them with any meaningful protection against the
Member States’ actions.”?**

The Claimant underscores that the Respondent “confirms that in the Achmea decision, the CJIEU
did not declare Article 8 of the Treaty invalid.”?*? Given that the CJEU only relied on EU law and
did not address investment arbitration agreements under international law, the CJEU’s decision
ruling on the incompatibility of investment arbitration agreements held in an intra-EU BIT with
EU law has no bearing on that arbitration agreement. Thus, citing the tribunal in PL Holdings
S.a.r.1.v. Poland, the Claimant argues that this Tribunal should establish its jurisdiction over the

present dispute on the sole basis of the Treaty, and not on the basis of EU law.”

The Claimant considers that the Respondent’s explanations on the procedural history of the
Achmea judgment have no bearing on the case at hand.”*! The Claimant thus underscores that the

German Federal Court “was not at liberty to come to a different conclusion that the CJEU did in

The Claimant further notes that the EU is not a party to the Treaty,’ and that the Achmea
Judgment is not binding upon the Tribunal, as tribunals constituted under intra-EU BITs do not
qualify as jurisdictions of Member States.°> Considering furthermore that the Achmea Judgment
does not have horizontal effect,?"° the Claimant argues that the decision is not directed at private

investors.”°”

(c) The Treaty, Including Article 8, Remains Valid until it is Terminated in

Accordance with its Provisions

The Claimant argues that Article 13(2) of the Treaty is the sole provision that can be relied upon

for the purposes of termination of the Treaty or of one of its provisions.”

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s counterargument that the termination of the Treaty is
unnecessary to render Article 8 inapplicable, considering that it ceased to be in force upon the
Czech Republic’s accession to the EU in 2004. Even if Article 8 of the Treaty were to be
considered inapplicable, this has no incidence on the existence of the Claimant’s consent to
arbitration, made on 19 December 2017, before the Achmea Judgment. This is supported by the
award in Eskosol v. Italy, where the tribunal, referring to Article 69 VCLT, ruled as follows:

Even if as a matter of EU law the Achmea Judgment is considered to be ex tune, in the
sense that Italy lacked consent from the inception to agree to Article 26 of the ECT, this
still would not imply that Eskosol’s acceptance — prior to the Achmea Judgment — of
Italy’s apparent offer of ECT arbitration is considered to be void. This follows from
Article 69 of the VCLT regarding the consequences under international law of the
invalidity of a treaty because of lack of consent. [...]

Under Article 69(1), the general rule is that invalidation of a treaty based on the absence
of consent operates retroactively, with the effect that the provisions of that treaty are
“void” and “have no legal force.” Consistent with the general rule, the parties to the treaty
may require each other to restore the situation that existed as between them ex ante
(restitutio in integrum). However, there is an important exception to this rule stated in
Article 69(2)(b), under which acts that have been performed “in good faith before the
invalidity was invoked” are not considered unlawful simply because of invalidity of the
treaty. In the Tribunal’s view, this is the case for arbitration agreements perfected before
the Achmea Judgment, in reliance on EU Member States’ apparent offer of consent to
investor-State arbitration under the ECT or other treaties. The conclusion that investors

accepted that apparent offer in good faith follows from the point, discussed above, that
any invalidity in the offer of consent was far from “manifest” prior to the Achmea
Judgment. Indeed, lack of consent was neither manifested in the text of the ECT itself; the
contemporaneous conduct of the Commission and EU Member States, none of which
“sought an opinion from the Court on the compatibility of that treaty with the EU and FEU
Treaties”; and the subsequent shifting positions of the Commission regarding whether
additional action by EU Member States would be required in order to terminate intra-EU
treaties. It was not until the CJEU actually issued the Achmea Judgment that, at the very
earliest, given persisting debate about whether that Judgment even reaches the ECT, it
could be said that investors were placed on notice about the risks of relying on Member
States’ apparent consent to arbitration in Article 26 of the ECT.?”

Citing the award in Marfin v. Cyprus , the Claimant asserts that “there can be no implied
termination or invalidation of the Treaty to the detriment of investors who legitimately relied upon
the Treaty’s protections”. Contrary to what the Respondent states in its Reply, this reference
supports the view that there cannot be an implied termination of the Treaty. Indeed, the tribunal
found that “no termination procedures under the relevant BIT were followed, which was one of
the grounds to deny the respondent’s objection.”>"!

The Claimant further contends that the Czech Republic has not demonstrated how EU law could
have validly led to the Respondent’s retroactive withdrawal of its consent to arbitrate.*” Its
reference to a treaty agreeing to the termination of all intra-EU BITs is premature: there is, as of
today, no agreement for the termination of all intra-EU BITs.* In any event, this proves yet
again that “there was no automatic inapplicability or termination of the arbitration clauses in all

the intra-EU BITs as a result of the Achmea Judgment.”

(d) Conclusion

The Claimant thus concludes that Article 8 of the Treaty remains applicable and that the Tribunal

should uphold jurisdiction in the present case.

(iii) The European Commission’s Position

In its amicus curiae brief, relying on case law of the Permanent Court of International Justice,

the European Commission argues that “the Arbitral Tribunal is under obligation to analyse

whether the EU Treaties constitute an obstacle to its jurisdiction.”

In the present case, the European Commission considers that both EU law and Czech law govern
substance and jurisdiction issues. Thus, it notes that in JSW v. Czech Republic, the tribunal held
that it had to “apply the rules of law with the closest connection with the dispute in accordance
with the so-called principle of proximity” and further held that, in the words of the European

Commission, “in an intra-EU investment arbitration, Union law was part of the law applicable to

deciding issues related to jurisdiction.”°°”

Should the Tribunal consider that EU law and Czech law do not govern the dispute at hand, the

European Commission notes that other tribunals have assessed the existence and validity of

ste . . 3
arbitration offers under international law.*”*

In any event, in the European Commission’s view, “the outcome is identical, the Arbitral Tribunal

lacks jurisdiction.”°”

The European Commission further argues that EU law “takes precedence over conflicting rules
of international law in the legal order of the Netherlands and the Czech Republic over the Dutch-
Czech BIT since 1 May 2004.”3!° According to the European Commission, the principle of

primacy of EU law applies not only to each Member State’s domestic law, but also to international

311

treaties concluded between two Member States such as the Treaty.”'’ When a State is party to a

treaty with a Member State and later becomes itself a Member State, “EU law takes precedence

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award

Because EU law takes precedence over both national law and international commitments between
Member States, it has been ruled that “private individuals ‘may not rely on prior international
agreements between [two Member States] in order to prevent the application of the interim
regulations adopted by the Community in the event of any incompatibility between the two
categories of provisions.”*'> This, in turn, has been accepted in the award in Electrabel v.

Hungary3"*
The European Commission thus concludes that:

when the Czech Republic joined the EU, it was aware of the rule of primacy, including
the relevant case law, which forms part of the EU acquis (as were of course the
Netherlands, a founding member). The will of the Netherlands and the Czech Republic,
when signing the Treaty of Accession, was that, in the matters covered by EU law, their
reciprocal relationships would be governed by EU law, including the rule of conflict of
primacy of law.

Therefor[e] the conflict between the Dutch-Czech BIT and EU law must be resolved in

favour of the latter and anybody called upon to apply the former must, on the basis of

primacy of EU law, set aside the arbitration clause in the Dutch-Czech BIT and decline to

apply it2!>
Because the primacy rule is a special conflict rule under the EU Treaties, the European
Commission argues that Article 30 VCLT only sets out “residual rules, i.e. rules that apply where
the Contracting Parties have not provided for special conflict rules”.*"°
In the alternative, the European Commission considers that Article 59 VCLT — which relates to
the signature of successive treaties — “provides for two scenarios in which the conclusion of a
successor treaty gives rise to the implied termination of an existing treaty”: when it appears the
later treaty should govern a specific matter or when the later treaty is so incompatible with the
earlier one that they cannot both be applied at the same time.*"” Either of these situations could

apply in the present case, in the European Commission’s view:

(a) When the Netherlands and the Czech Republic signed the EU Treaties, “[t]heir intention
[...] was that the protection of intra-EU investments would be governed from that

moment by EU law rather than by the BIT”;*'*

(b) “BITs are entirely incompatible with EU law”?

The European Commission further notes that “according to some commentators, Art. 59 VCLT
can lead to partial termination of an existing international agreement, namely in situations where
only part of the successor Treaty can be regarded as giving rise to incompatibility.”*”°

As to the requirement that the treaties concern the “same subject matter”, the European
Commission argues that this criterion “should not be read as imposing an additional condition”
for Article 59 to apply and that, in any event, the correct test to determine this is whether the
treaties “govern the same legal situation”.*?!

Consequently, the Treaty “was implicitly terminated upon the accession of the Czech Republic to
the EU on 1 May 2004.3” It is unnecessary for the formal termination steps to be pursued:

Article 59 suffices.

Should the Tribunal disagree with this perception of Article 59 VCLT, the European Commission
considers that “the same result, namely the precedence of EU law, would ensue from the
application of Art. 30(3) VCLT.”* Indeed, taking aim at the tribunal’s reasoning in the award in
Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic, the European Commission refers to the decision in PL Holding
v. Poland to argue that the criteria of “conflict” and “same subject matter” are not distinct

conditions, but a single condition?”

Even if the Tribunal were to adopt the same reasoning as the tribunal in Eastern Sugar v. Czech
Republic, and if “same subject matter” and “conflict” were considered separate criteria, both
would be met because “EU law prohibits both the procedural and the substantive rules of the
Dutch-Czech BIT” through provisions of the TEU and of the TFEU (notably Articles 267 and
344).75

The European Commission concludes that the reasoning which led arbitral tribunals to rule that

intra-EU BITs and the EU Treaties do not relate to the same subject matter is flawed because: (i)

“it disregards the case-law of the PCIJ, pursuant to which international courts and tribunals have
to decide on questions of treaty conflict”; (ii) “Article 30 VCLT is only a residual conflict rule”,
such that the principle of primacy, as a special conflicts rule, should apply first; (iii) “intra-EU

BIT and the EU Treaties do cover the same subject matter”.*?°

Arbitral tribunals have similarly erred in considering that “[i]nternational law would contain a
“fundamental principle’ that protects an ‘acquired right’ of Claimant.”’ Referring to the ICJ
jurisprudence, the European Commission argues that “there is no general principle of legitimate

expectations under international law” and no basis for an investor to claim an acquired right.

In ruling that the Achmea Judgment should apply only ex nunc, rather than ex tunc, the arbitral
tribunals have mistakenly evaluated the role of the CJEU, which purports to interpret the law.”
As such, “[t]he judgment in Achmea states the law as it always has been and, hence, as it must be
applied including in pending cases.”**°

Finally, the European Commission considers that the sunset clause contained in the Treaty does
not apply as (i) it “only regulates the legal consequence of unilateral termination of the BIT by
one contracting party” and (ii) its objective is to “prolong the application in time of the offer to

arbitrate”, an offer which is now precluded under EU law and therefore invalid.*!

by the Contracting Parties pursuant to Article 31 VCLT

(i) The Respondent’s Position

   

The Respondent contends that its position that Article 8 of the Treaty is incompatible with the
TFEU (and thus inapplicable) is further confirmed by the Declarations, which “represent an
authentic interpretation of the BIT between the Netherlands and the Czech Republic”,*? under
Article 31(3)(a) VCLT. Indeed, these Declarations amount to a “subsequent agreement” within
the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) VCLT. *

Article 31(3)(a) VCLT provides that, in interpreting treaties,

There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty
or the application of its provisions.™4

The Declarations, in their most relevant parts, state:

Member States are bound to draw all necessary consequences from that judgment pursuant
to their obligations under Union law.

Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member
States. As a consequence, all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral
investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus
inapplicable. They do not produce effects including as regards provisions that provide for
extended protection of investments made prior to termination for a further period of time
(so-called sunset or grandfathering clauses). An arbitral tribunal established on the basis
of investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer to
arbitrate by the Member State party to the underlying bilateral investment Treaty.

Furthermore, international agreements concluded by the Union, including the Energy
Charter Treaty, are an integral part of the EU legal order and must therefore be compatible
with the Treaties. Arbitral tribunals have interpreted the Energy Charter Treaty as also
containing an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between Member States.
Interpreted in such a manner, that clause would be incompatible with the Treaties and thus
would have to be disapplied.

The Respondent considers that, when interpreting a treaty provision, in accordance with the ICJ
judgment in Kasikili Sedudu Island (Botswana v. N amibia), an interpretation by the contracting

parties after the conclusion of the treaty “must be read into the treaty for purposes of its

interpretation” .** In this case, the Respondent argues that the Declarations signed, inter alia, by

the Czech Republic and the Netherlands, “stated their interpretation of the effects of the TFEU

on the dispute resolution clauses of intra-EU BITs.”*’ As such, these Declarations also qualified

as “a binding authentic interpretation” not only of the TFEU, but also of the Treaty.***

According to the Respondent, the Declarations also qualify as State practice, within the meaning

of Article 31(3)(b) VCLT. Such practice “may consist of any conduct of a party in the application

of a treaty, whether in the exercise of its executive, legislative, judicial or other functions.”*? In
the present case, the “practice of the EU Member States in relation to the interpretation of the
intra-EU BITs has been strongly in favour of denying the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunals
based on intra-EU BITs.”*"”

Article 31(3)(b) VCLT provides that, when interpreting treaties,

There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

L.]

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement

of the parties regarding its interpretation; “any subsequent practice in the application of

the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation [...]

shall be taken into account.*"!
Consequently, pursuant to Article 31 VCLT, the Declarations ought to be analysed as an authentic
interpretation of intra-EU BITs — including the Treaty at hand. Whether or not the States had an
intention to terminate the intra-EU BITs has no bearing on the fact that arbitration clauses

contained therein are invalid.

Similarly, the behaviour of Czech courts or of the Czech Ministry of Finance does not have any
significance for the validity of Article 8 of the Treaty.” The underlying Treaty itself remains

valid and effective.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent addressed for the first time the Termination
Agreement.*? In the Respondent’s view, contrary to what the Claimant argues, the Termination
Agreement “does not mean that the arbitration clauses in the BITs are valid until the BITs are
terminated pursuant to the Termination Agreement.”*“ On the contrary, it “confirms that [...]

intra-EU investment arbitration has not been available to investors since the accession of the

respective host state to the European Union.”*°

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

For its part, the Claimant considers that the conduct of the Contracting Parties proves that the
Treaty was never terminated: “both the host state (Czech Republic) and the home state (the
Netherlands) in the present case showed the intention to fulfil the obligations under the Treaty
(also long after 2004)” — i.e. long after the Czech Republic’s accession to the European Union.*“°
Indeed, whereas the Czech Republic terminated some intra-EU BITs, it never did so with the
Treaty, following a refusal of the Netherlands to agree to such a termination in 2010.**” In fact,
the Claimant notes that the Treaty remains listed as a valid treaty on the website of the Czech
Republic’s Ministry of Finance.** Moreover, Czech courts themselves have recognized that intra-

EU BITs are valid and effective.*”

The Claimant further disagrees with the Respondent’s qualification of the Declarations as
authentic interpretation of the Treaty.**° First, the Claimant considers that the mere existence of
the Declarations serves as proof of the continued validity of arbitration agreements in intra-EU
BITs.**! Second, the Declarations are irrelevant because “states cannot circumvent the formal
requirements that a state may be obligated to undertake under an international instrument, i.e. the

formal requirements for termination under the Treaty and the VCLT.”3*

In the Claimant’s eyes, the Declarations are “a mere political document [...] and of no binding

effect whatsoever.”*?

Third, the Claimant argues that it is not possible for the Respondent to retroactively revoke its
consent to arbitrate by relying on the declarations. The Treaty being in force at the time when the
Claimant accepted the offer to arbitrate on 5 November 2015, the Claimant’s recourse to

arbitration is valid and the Tribunal has jurisdiction.

255. Citing the Netherlands’ remarks before the CJEU,*™ the Claimant further argues that “the
unilateral offer of a state to arbitrate as contained in an investment treaty cannot be revoked during
the extended validity period under the so-called sunset clause [...]. During such time, foreign
investors should be considered to have legitimate expectations that they would remain protected
under the Treaty.”

256. Responding to the Tribunal’s questions as to the effect of the Termination Agreement on the
present proceedings, the Claimant argues that the mere existence of this agreement “strengthens
Fynerdale’s position that there is no automatic inapplicability or termination of the arbitration
clause in all intra-EU BITs as a result of the Achmea Judgment and the incompatibility with EU
law.”*°°

257. Furthermore, noting that the Termination Agreement has not been ratified by either of the
signatory States of the BIT, the Claimant reiterates that the Tribunal should uphold jurisdiction
under Article 8 of the BIT.**’ Even if the signatory States of the BIT were to ratify the Termination
Agreement, this would have no incidence on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, considering the
agreement has no retroactive effect.***

258. Last, the Claimant notes that its rights would be protected under the BIT only if the arbitration
were to be still pending when the signatory States of the BIT ratified the Termination Agreement.
In order to benefit from that protection, the Claimant argues that “in order for Fynerdale to be
able to invoke the protections granted to it under the Termination Agreement, it is crucial for the

Tribunal to declare that [it] has jurisdiction.”

(iii) The European Commission’s Position

“important elements of context”.*” These “constitute subsequent agreement between the parties

which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation pursuant to Article

31(1)(3)(a) and (b) of the [VCLT] concerning the EU Treaties and concerning the [Treaty].”°°!

The European Commission notes that both States have signed the Termination Agreement,
thereby giving an authentic interpretation of the conflict rules applicable to the Treaty.*° Such
interpretative declarations must be respected by arbitral tribunals.*°’ Moreover, considering that
there are no temporal restrictions in the VCLT as to the effect of a subsequent agreement, the
European Commission argues that “[s]ubsequent agreements on interpretation apply ab initio,

that is, as of the date of entry into force of the treaty”.°*

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has considered carefully the arguments advanced by the Parties in respect of the
possible effects of the Achmea Judgment. The Tribunal has reviewed subsequent awards and
judgments on this issue. Further, the Tribunal has considered the Declarations and the
Termination Agreement (which the Czech Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands,

respectively, have signed but, at the time of the Hearing, not yet ratified).

The Tribunal is aware of the fact that it is dealing with the same bilateral investment agreement
that was considered by the CJEU in the Achmea Judgment, although the respondents in the two

arbitrations differ. The Respondent has emphasized this fact.

Before dealing with the arguments advanced by the Parties, it seems appropriate to address some

general considerations.

It is important to bear in mind, as a paramount factor relating to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,
that the latter is established by, and derives its powers (if any) from, the consent of the Parties.

That consent operates at two successive stages.

(a) The first stage originates from the Treaty. According to Article 8 of that Treaty,
investors of one Contracting Party have a right to submit disputes with the other

Contracting Party before an arbitral tribunal. Article 8(1) and (2) read as follows:

Id., para. 10.
Id., para. 87.
Id., para. 88,
Id., para. 90.

PCA 295083 73

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award
29 April 2021

(1) All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled
amicably.

(2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in
paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled
amicably within a period of six months from the date either party to the dispute
requested amicable settlement.

As a matter of international law, those provisions constitute an offer of the Parties to
the Treaty, which can be accepted, if certain conditions are met, by an investor. At this
first stage, the Tribunal is concerned with the consent of the Netherlands and the
Czech Republic as expressed in Article 8 of the Treaty, to be interpreted in accordance
with international law and, in particular, the VCLT.

(b) The second stage originates from the acceptance of the offer by the Claimant, as an
investor and national of the Netherlands, here effected through the commencement of
arbitral proceedings under Article 8 of the Treaty. Upon such acceptance, there is
consent between the investor and the Contracting Party to submit to the jurisdiction of
the arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with the Treaty, in respect of the dispute
referred to it. Provided that all other conditions stipulated in the Treaty, including those
relating to such matters as the nationality of the investor, the six-month cooling-off
period and the investment, have been met, the arbitral tribunal established in accordance

with the Treaty has at least prima facie jurisdiction over the dispute.

As the Respondent has rightly pointed out, international law alone may not be determinative for
answering the question whether the Claimant has validly accepted an offer to arbitrate the present
dispute before this Tribunal. Rather, this question posing itself at the second stage operates under
both international law and, here, also under the laws of the Netherlands as the /ex loci arbitri
applying to UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings since the agreed place of arbitration is The
Hague. Whether or not the consent was valid when expressed, whether it remained valid when
The Hague was agreed as the place of arbitration, and whether the present dispute is arbitrable
under the laws of the Netherlands are questions that are disputed between the Parties. The

Tribunal will examine the implications of the laws of the Netherlands in Section V.B.3 below.

Theoretically, those consequences may operate in distinct ways. For example, EU law may affect
the capacity of a State to consent to an international treaty, may affect the capacity of a private
party subject to EU law to accept an offer to arbitrate under an international treaty, or may affect
the performance of obligations under such treaty. EU law, further, may affect the manner in which
disputes arising under such treaty are to be settled, thus affecting the jurisdiction of tribunals

established outside the EU legal order. Finally, EU law, being part of the applicable national law,

PCA 295083 74

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award
29 April 2021

may influence the scope of obligations under such treaty. These distinctions are to be borne in

mind when deciding the present dispute.

267. The Tribunal deems it appropriate to add that it is necessary to distinguish between Article 8(1)
and (2) of the Treaty, providing for the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal and the law to be applied
by the tribunal as stipulated by Article 8(6) of the Treaty. Whether EU law has an impact on the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal is at the centre of the dispute concerning jurisdiction.

268. By way of clarification, a final general consideration may be called for. The Tribunal will have
to take into consideration that the Treaty as well as the TFEU and the TEU are part of international
law, the two latter ones being of a regional nature. As to whether the latter two exclude the
application of the former is a matter of disagreement between the Parties to which the Tribunal

will now turn.

(i) Whether the EU Treaties Preclude the Application of the Treaty

269. The Tribunal notes that the arguments invoked by the Respondent in its Submission on
Jurisdiction and its Reply, respectively, are not fully identical. Section 2.3.1 of the Respondent’s
Submission on Jurisdiction is headed “The TFEU and the TEU as /egis posteriori to the BIT” and
simply states that the TEU and the TFEU were concluded after the Treaty entered into force. The
following Section 2.3.2 of the Submission on Jurisdiction deals with Article 30 VCLT and
concentrates on the question of the “same subject matter” test. Paragraphs 49-52 of the
Submission on Jurisdiction cover Article 351 TFEU. In its Reply, the order between the
arguments based upon Article 351 TFEU and Article 30 VCLT is reversed.*°

270. The Tribunal will ascertain, with a view to covering all the facets of the Respondent’s arguments,
first, whether the European Treaties, pursuant to Article 351 TFEU, as interpreted in the Achmea
Judgment, have superseded the Treaty with the consequence of a direct inapplicability of the
Treaty or of Article 8 of the Treaty. Second, the Tribunal will ascertain whether one of these
consequences can be successfully argued by the Respondent on the basis of Articles 30 and 59

VCLT.

271. The arguments of the Respondent may be summarized as follows. Article 8 of the Treaty provides
for dispute resolution by arbitration, whereas Articles 267 and 344 TFEU require the mandatory
submission of disputes to national courts. The latter is relevant for the EU since national courts

can involve the CJEU concerning the interpretation of EU law in relation to the application of

national law, which international arbitral tribunals cannot. The Respondent states that “[b]oth

provisions order the exclusive resolution of the same dispute by different mutually exclusive

fora.”® The Claimant takes the opposite position.”

Although expressed in terms of separate heads, the Respondent’s arguments essentially fall into
two categories — arguments relating to the effect of EU law on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and
arguments relating to the application of principles of international law on the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. The question is whether, on either basis, the Respondent’s claim that the Tribunal has

no jurisdiction can be upheld.

(a) The Respondent’s Arguments on the Basis of EU Law and Counter-arguments

of the Claimant

The Respondent argues that, under EU law, a provision in a bilateral investment treaty between
two Member States allowing the investors of one Member State to take judicial action against the
other Member State can have no validity. The Respondent invokes Article 351 TFEU while

relying on the interpretation of this norm in the Achmea Judgment.

Article 351(1) and (2) TFEU reads:

(1) The rights and obligations from agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for
acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States
on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the
provisions of the Treaties.

(2) To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the EU Treaties, the
Member State or States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the
incompatibilities established. Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to
that end and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common attitude.

The Parties disagree whether Article 351 TFEU is a conflicts clause.”

The Tribunal, reading the two paragraphs together, shares the view of the Respondent that
Article 351(1) and (2) TFEU constitutes a conflict clause covering pre-accession treaties between
Member States and non-Member States, including non-Member States which later joined (or
might join) the EU. However, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent about the consequences

of such qualification of Article 351(1) and (2) TFEU. The Tribunal is not convinced by the

Respondent’s argument that Article 351(2) does not apply to agreements between States of which
one or the other, after the conclusion of an investment agreement that allegedly does not conform
to the EU Treaties, have acceded to the EU. The wording of Article 351(1) clearly addresses such
agreements, and Article 351(2) TFEU refers to “such” agreements thus embracing both situations

referred to in Article 351(1) TFEU.

The Tribunal further disagrees with the Respondent’s argument that provisions of a treaty
concluded with a State that became a Member State that are incompatible with EU law are
automatically inapplicable. As the Tribunal has already stated, it is important to distinguish
between the incompatibility of the Treaty, which the CJEU has authoritatively stated, and the

consequences for the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

In the view of the Tribunal, automatic inapplicability is not what Article 351(1) and (2) TFEU
postulates. The two paragraphs of Article 351 TFEU prescribe obligations of conduct rather than
of result or an automaticity in respect of non-applicability. It provides that the Member State or
States shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate incompatibilities. In the view of the Tribunal,
this reading of Article 351 TFEU reflects the fact that the TFEU as well as the TEU and the
Treaty, although belonging to public international law, operate on different levels, as already

stated above.>” Without an explicit rule to the contrary, none takes precedence over the other.
The Tribunal is aware of the Achmea Judgment, on which the Respondent relies. The Court ruled:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the
Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which
an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning
investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State
before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to
accept”!

It is not for this Tribunal to comment upon this judgment or even to question its findings
concerning EU law. This Tribunal accepts the competence of the CJEU to finally interpret EU
law and to decide on the incompatibility of national law with EU law. It is in the view of this
Tribunal, however, necessary to distinguish between the rulings of the CJEU on EU law, in
particular on Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, and the consequences to be drawn from this judgment

for the Treaty, an instrument belonging to public international law.

The Tribunal notes that the Achmea Judgment is not binding on this Tribunal, neither directly nor

indirectly. On this, the Parties agree.>””

As to whether this judgment is binding on the Contracting
Parties of the Treaty can be left open since the Tribunal will establish in due course that this is

irrelevant.

Although this Tribunal is not called upon to interpret the Achmea Judgment, it cannot fail to notice
that the Court did not specify the procedural consequences of its ruling that Articles 267 and 344
TFEU preclude a provision such as Article 8 of the Treaty. Such procedural consequences, namely
the direct non-applicability of Article 8 of the Treaty, were developed and advocated by the
Respondent based on its interpretation of Article 351 TFEU. This interpretation of Article 351
TFEU was addressed and refuted by the Tribunal already.

Contrary to the arguments advanced by the Respondent, the Tribunal holds that the preclusion of

the Treaty does not lead to an automatic inapplicability of that norm.
(b) Relevance of the Post-Achmea Practice of EU Member States

The Tribunal will now turn to the post-Achmea practice of the Member States as reflected in the
Declarations and more specifically in the Termination Agreement. The Parties disagree on the

conclusions to be drawn from these Declarations as well as the Termination Agreement.

The Respondent argues that the Declarations “provide an authentic declaration ‘that all investor-
State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member
States are contrary to the Union law and thus inapplicable.’””*”> The Respondent argues that this
is “a reasonable consequence for the purpose of legal certainty”.

The Claimant takes the opposite position.*” It states that after the enlargement of the EU with ten
members in 2004, the Member States did not terminate their intra-EU bilateral investment
agreements. The Claimant emphasizes that no provisions regarding the termination of intra-EU
investment agreements were included in the accession agreement of 2003 regulating inter alia the
accession of the Czech Republic to the EU. The Claimant points in this respect to the 2008 Annual

which reports that the concerns of the European Commission concerning arbitration were not

shared by most of the Member States.>””

Further, the Claimant points out that at the beginning of 2009, the Czech Republic proposed to
Member States to terminate their intra-EU BITs by mutual consent. To this, several Member
States agreed, but not the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The Claimant quotes from a letter of the
Government of the Netherlands, which rejected the bilateral termination of the Treaty with the
Czech Republic with the view to the ongoing attempts of the European Commission to reach a
comprehensive solution for intra-EU BITs.*” The Claimant also points out that the Treaty was
listed as a valid treaty on the homepage of the Czech Ministry of Finance, as well on the homepage
of the Government of the Netherlands in 2019.*” The Claimant argues that no post-Achmea

practice rendered the Treaty between the Netherlands and the Czech Republic inapplicable.

Having considered the practice of Member States in respect of intra-EU BITs, this Tribunal comes
to the conclusion that one cannot speak of a subsequent State practice within the meaning of
Article 31(3)(b) VCLT in respect of direct inapplicability of intra-EU BITS. The practice of the
Member States is not consistent, and the decision on the inapplicability of intra-EU investment
agreements is still in a process, which may have reached its final stage but has not been completed
yet. The Declarations only constitute political commitments of these Member States to terminate
bilateral investment agreements. The Tribunal has taken note of a preambular paragraph of the

Declaration of 15 January 2019 on which the Respondent relies. It reads:

Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member
States. As a consequence, all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral
investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus
inapplicable [...]. An arbitral tribunal established on the basis of investor-State arbitration
clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack of a valid offer to arbitrate by the Member State
party to the underlying bilateral investment Treaty. **°

Leaving aside whether such a declaration would have had any legal effect on a treaty of public
international law, as the Respondent argues, this Tribunal is bound to refer to the operative part
of this Declaration. For example, paragraph 5 of the Declaration reads:

In light of the Achmea judgment, Member States will terminate all bilateral investment

treaties concluded between them by means of a plurilateral treaty or, where that is
mutually recognized as more expedient, bilaterally"!

In the view of the Tribunal, paragraph 5 of the operative part of the Declaration indicates that the
statement in the preambular paragraph quoted above is of a political and not a legally binding
nature. It reflects the view of the Member States, but as indicated in paragraph 5 of that
Declaration, the Member States are aware and accept the legal fact that termination of an
international law-based treaty can only been achieved by a consent-based agreement amongst the
parties of that treaty concerned. The Tribunal would like to emphasize that international law is
formalistic in respect of the conclusion of international treaties as well as in respect of their
termination. A political commitment prescribing the result of a process, not yet finalized, is not

sufficient to achieve the inapplicability of the treaty in question.

The Respondent argues that the conclusion of bilateral treaties or of a plurilateral treaty is meant

to achieve “legal certainty”.**”

This argument is, in the view of the Tribunal, not convincing. It has already been established that
the Achmea Judgment is not binding on this Tribunal. The Tribunal does not intend to decide on
the consequences thereof under EU law. If the ruling in the Achmea Judgment is binding on the
Parties to the Treaty, the Parties have, so far, not undertaken the necessary steps, by either
concluding and ratifying a bilateral treaty or a plurilateral treaty, to terminate the Treaty between

them.

The Respondent also invokes the Termination Agreement, which constitutes the plurilateral treaty
referred to in the Declaration of 15 January 2019. This Agreement repeats in its preambular
paragraphs that bilateral intra-EU investment agreements are contrary to EU law and their
arbitration clauses cannot serve as a basis for arbitration. The Respondent refers to a statement of
the European Commission to this extent. The Tribunal wishes to point out that this Agreement

provides for a termination procedure in Articles 2 and 4. Article 2(1) reads:

'| are terminated according to the terms

294. Article 4(2) of the Termination Agreement adds that such termination shall take effect as soon as

the Agreement enters into force for the relevant Contracting Parties.

295. This, in the view of the Tribunal, confirms that the Treaty, in the eyes of the signatories to the
Termination Agreement, will terminate only after the Termination Agreement has entered into
force for the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech Republic respectively, and not before
that date as a consequence of the Declarations to which the Respondent refers or the Termination

Agreement which neither the Kingdom of the Netherlands nor the Czech Republic have ratified.

296. The Tribunal will now turn to the argument of the Respondent that Article 8 has been superseded
by the provisions of the TFEU pursuant to Article 30 VCLT.

(ii) Inapplicability of Article 8 of the Treaty pursuant to Article 30 VCLT

297. The Tribunal notes the Respondent’s argument that the non-applicability of Article 8 of the Treaty
384

does not require the non-applicability of the Treaty as a whole.

298. However, in the view of the Tribunal, this does not alter the legal considerations the Tribunal has
set out so far. Neither the Achmea Judgment, nor the Declarations, nor the Termination Agreement
indicate that Article 8 of the Treaty lost its applicability at the moment the Czech Republic became
a Member State of the EU on | May 2004.

299. The Tribunal will now briefly deal with the argument invoked by the Respondent that the TFEU
and the TEU are /ex posterior to the Treaty. It is correct that these two instruments were concluded
after the Treaty. However, this does not mean that the earlier Treaty would automatically become
inapplicable. This consequence would require that the treaties concerned cover the same subject
matter and are in substance incompatible. The Tribunal will deal with this issue under the

subsequent heading.

300. The Respondent argues — as a “subsidiary” **°

argument — that Article 8 of the Treaty is
inapplicable because of the operation of Article 30(1) to (3) VCLT, which is concerned with
situations of incompatibility between particular provisions in successive treaties. The paragraphs

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations
of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter shall be
determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as
incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier

treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies

only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the latter treaty.
Article 30(1), referring to Article 103 of the United Nations Charter, which gives obligations
arising under the Charter priority over other treaty obligations, is of no relevance in this case.
Article 30(2) VCLT deals with situations where there is an express provision governing relations
between successive treaties. As there is no such provision in this case, Article 30(2) VCLT is

equally irrelevant.

The Respondent argues that Article 30(3) VCLT — although considered only a subsidiary rule to
Article 351 TFEU*** — renders Article 8 of the Treaty inapplicable.**’ In fact, it argues that
Article 30(3) VCLT leads to the same result, on the same grounds as Article 351 TFEU. Having
recourse to the legislative history of Article 30 VCLT, the Respondent argues that Article 30
VCLT addresses rules of different treaties having the “same subject matter.”*** The Respondent
in a two-step argument continues by stating that Article 8 of the Treaty is incompatible with
Articles 267 and 344 TFEU as detailed in the Achmea Judgment, and thus Article 8 of the Treaty
does not constitute a valid offer to arbitrate.*”

According to the Claimant, Article 30(3) VCLT does not apply because the TEU and the TFEU
do not apply to the same subject-matter. As far as Article 8 of the Treaty is concerned, the
Claimant argues that an inconsistency of that provision with Articles 267 and 344 TFEU (which

is being denied) would not automatically terminate the applicability of Article 8 of the Treaty.”

As far as inconsistency of Article 8 of the Treaty with EU law is concerned, **' the Tribunal would

like to refer to its reasoning concerning Article 351 TFEU above.’

the fact that the Respondent argued that Article 351 TFEU and Article 30(3) VCLT work along

Such reference is justified by

the same lines. However, the Tribunal would like to add some further considerations to the

interpretation and application of Article 30(3) VCLT.

It is, in the view of the Tribunal, essential to distinguish between the effect EU law may have on
the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and on the merits of the dispute. While the Tribunal does not
question that Article 30(3) VCLT may have an effect on jurisdiction as well as on the merits, it is
difficult to see for the Tribunal how Article 30 VCLT could offset the applicability of Article 8
of the Treaty, considering the Parties’ consent in Article 8 of the Treaty. It has to be taken into
account that the alleged incompatibility does not rest in the option opened by Article 8 of the
Treaty but possibly — not necessarily — in the consequences of an award issued on the basis of
Article 8 of the Treaty. Any such incompatibility would be a question of the effect of EU law as

part of the applicable law and, as such, a matter for the merits and not jurisdiction.

There is in the view of the Tribunal a theoretical exception, namely if Article 8 of the Treaty,
which provides for arbitration between the investor and the State, were by itself incompatible with
EU law. There is, however, no rule of EU law that prohibits investor-State arbitration in general.
There is, further, no rule ordering all investor-State disputes to be brought before the CJEU, which
would have no competence to decide on them anyway. The very reason for the attempts to bring
to an end intra-EU investment arbitration and to direct such disputes to national courts is that the
latter would have recourse to the Court of Justice in case of doubts as to whether the award in
question had violated or misinterpreted — directly or indirectly - EU law. Under the UNCITRAL
Rules, provided that a seat within the EU is selected, such possibility still exists in the context of

set-aside proceedings.

The argument that Article 8 of the Treaty is incompatible with EU law and automatically

inapplicable is therefore unsustainable. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s

See Theodoros Adamakopoulos, lektra Adamantidou, Vasileios Adamopoulos and others v. Cyprus, ICSID
Case No. ARB/15/49, Decision on Jurisdiction, 7 February 2020, para. 168. The tribunal in this case stated:
“[..] at a certain, general, level the treaties deal with the same subject matter. But at a more specific level
they deal with different subject matters. BITs deal with general obligations on states relating to foreign
investment within the countries of the contracting parties but they also provide a mechanism for nationals
of one party to bring a claim against another party, something that is not provided for in the EU Treaties.
Under the EU regime claimants are left in the hands of domestic courts only, something that BITs do not
provide for. In fact, BITs provide specifically for an alternative to determination by national courts. In that
respect, the EU Treaties and the BITs do not deal with the same subject matter.”

submission that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in consequence of the principle set out in Article

30 VCLT.

(iii) Termination of the Treaty pursuant to Article 59 VCLT

308. Both Parties have referred to Article 59 VCLT concerning the termination or suspension of the

operation of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty. Article 59 VCLT reads:

1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty
relating to the same subject matter and: (a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise
established that the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or
(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one
that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.

2. The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it appears from
the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the intention of the parties.

309. The Tribunal is not convinced by the submission of the Respondent that the Treaty has been

terminated in accordance with Article 59 VCLT. Several reasons lead to this conclusion. The first

reason is that the operation of Article 59 VCLT is subject to the procedure set out in Article 65
VCLT. The here relevant paragraphs 1-3 of Article 65 read:

1. A party which, under the provisions of the present Convention, invokes either a defect
in its consent to be bound by a treaty or a ground for impeaching the validity of a treaty,
terminating it, withdrawing from it or suspending its operation, must notify the other
parties of its claim. The notification shall indicate the measure proposed to be taken with
respect to the treaty and the reasons therefor.

2. If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of special urgency, shall not be
less than three months after the receipt of the notification, no party has raised any
objection, the party making the notification may carry out in the manner provided in article
67 the measure which it has proposed.

3. If, however, objection has been raised by any other party, the parties shall seek a
solution through the means indicated in article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations.

310. Inthe view of the Tribunal, it is therefore clear from the text of the quoted provision that invalidity

or termination of a treaty must be expressly invoked. The VCLT does not provide for the

automatic termination of treaties by operation of law (with the exception of treaties that conflict

with rules of jus cogens according to Article 64 VCLT). Neither Party has suggested that

questions of jus cogens are engaged in this case. Thus, this possibility is irrelevant in this case.

311. The second reason for dismissing this objection to jurisdiction on the basis of Article 59 VCLT

is that the application of that provision is expressly limited to situations where there are successive

treaties “relating to the same subject matter.” Article 45 VCLT excluding the possibility to invoke

the invalidity or the possibility to terminate a treaty is not applicable in the present case.

393,

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award
29 April 2021

As dealt with above, the Respondent has invoked Article 30 VCLT. In distinction to Article 59
VCLT, Article 30 is concerned with the priority between a particular provision of earlier and later
treaties relating to the same subject matter. Article 59 VCLT deals with the situation that the entire
treaty should be terminated by reason of the adoption of a later treaty relating to the same subject
matter. The very fact that these situations are treated separately in the VCLT indicates, in the view
of the Tribunal, that under Article 59 VCLT a broader overlap between the earlier and later
treaties is needed to trigger the application of this provision. Under Article 59 VCLT, the test is
whether the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that
the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time. Article 59 VLCT thus clearly

requires a broader incompatibility between the two treaties.

In any event, it is also necessary, as Article 59 VCLT expressly stipulates, that it either appear
from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended the later treaty to govern
the subject-matter. The alternative is that the provisions of the treaties that relate to the subject
matter are so far incompatible as to preclude the concurrent application of the two treaties. One
or other limb of that test must be satisfied if Article 59 VCLT is to operate. The Tribunal will

concentrate on the former.

As far as an intention that the later treaty should “govern the matter” is concerned, it is plainly
established that the Parties to the Treaty subsequently intended that EU law should apply in full
between them. There is, however, no evidence of any intention that the provisions of EU law
should result in the termination of the entire Treaty, as the Tribunal has established before”?
Nothing in the text of the EU Treaties produces that result and the necessary intention is not
established by extraneous evidence. The latter rather establishes the intent of the Member States
to provide for the non-applicability of all intra~EU investment treaties by a plurilateral agreement.
Since the subjective element of the States Parties required by Article 59 VCLT, namely the intent
that EU law shall replace the Treaty, is not demonstrated, the Tribunal sees no point in elaborating

whether and to what extent EU law and the Treaty are overlapping in substance.

2. Whether the Tribunal Must Uphold Jurisdiction as an Exception to the EU Law

Principle of Mutual Trust and Recognition

In the alternative, the Claimant argues that, even if Article 8 were inapplicable given the accession
of the Czech Republic to the EU, the Tribunal should uphold jurisdiction as an exception to the

EU legal principle of mutual trust and recognition. Indeed, according to the Claimant, its rights

would not be protected before the Czech courts, thus justifying that it be granted access to

arbitration.

The Respondent considers that the Claimant’s worries are ill-founded and considers that this is

not an adequate ground to justify access to arbitration.
a. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s reliance on an analogy between the current situation and
the jurisprudence regarding the European arrest warrants and on European asylum as “legally and

factually flawed”.>*

First, the Respondent argues that the principle of mutual trust only applies with regard to Member
States’ courts.*°> While exceptions have been granted, the two quoted by the Claimant relate to
“completely unrelated fields of law which are not relevant for the question at hand.”**° There is
no such exception with regard to claims for damages against states.*”” In the Respondent’s view,
the Claimant’s argument that it cannot go before Czech courts because these allegedly do not
meet certain human rights standards, thus requiring that the arbitration agreement be ruled as
being still valid, “makes no sense at all.”*°* In fact, this has no bearing on the actual invalidity of

the arbitration clause.”

Second, the Claimant’s criticism against the Czech legal system is baseless.“ Noting that the
report relied upon by the Claimant criticizes half of the EU domestic jurisdictions, *” the

Respondent underscores that the Claimant has provided no evidence to support its argument that
the Czech courts show a “systemic deficiency”.“”? Quite on the contrary, the Claimant’s argument
“somewhat backfires if one compares the seven cases in which the Czech Republic was found to

have violated article 6 [of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’)] to the numbers

regarding other states.“ In fact, the evidence submitted by the Claimant itself shows that the
404

system works.
In its Reply, the Respondent further noted that the Czech Republic had only been held liable in
three of thirty-eight investment cases initiated against it, showing that the Claimant’s attempts to

paint the Czech Republic as an unsafe jurisdiction were “pure sophistry.”“°>

b. — The Claimant’s Position

In reviewing the legal framework that applies to this arbitration,*”° the Claimant reviews a number
of European law principles, including that of mutual trust and recognition.” The principle of
mutual trust and recognition, according to the Claimant, entails a reciprocal presumption, amongst
Member States, that all Member States comply with EU law, and particularly with EU
fundamental rights.“°* However, there are limits to this principle, in exceptional circumstances:*”
notably in European arrest warrants and asylum cases.‘'’ In such cases, Member States are
expected to verify, beyond the principle of mutual trust, that fundamental human rights are

respected"!

While the CJEU relied on the principle of mutual trust and recognition in the Achmea Judgment,
the Claimant argues that in the present case “[t]here is [...] a real risk that Fynerdale will suffer a

breach of its fundamental right to an independent tribunal in the Czech Republic and, therefore,

of the essence of its fundamental right to a fair trial and an effective remedy.”

Indeed, the Czech Republic’s standing as the “third most popular respondent country in investor-
state disputes [...] is clear-cut evidence of backsliding the rule of law”.*'? The Claimant further
argues that “81% cases at the [European Court of Human Rights] resulted in decisions against the
Czech Republic and the majority of those decisions are based on a violation of Article 6 of the

[European Convention of Human Rights] providing for the right to a fair trial.”*'* Moreover, the

Claimant highlights that “according to the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, the
current antidiscrimination legislation does not facilitate access to justice for victims of
discrimination in the Czech Republic” and that Czech proceedings are incommensurably long,
leading to a number of sanctions by the European Court of Human Rights under Article 6 of the

European Convention on Human Rights.“!°

324. The Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s arguments that the limitations to the principle of mutual
trust relates to unrelated fields of law as being inapposite, considering that the principle of mutual
recognition — and hence, its exceptions — applies to “all areas of law as well, including investment

disputes.”*"°

325. Hence, even if the Tribunal were to consider that the Treaty’s arbitration agreement is not valid,
it should nonetheless uphold jurisdiction, as
there is a clear risk that Fynerdale’s right to free movement of capital will not be
safeguarded in the Czech Republic’s judicial system. [...] It is therefore necessary to limit
the principles of mutual recognition and mutual trust in this case against the Czech

Republic. As a result, in this particular case, only the Tribunal can ensure that Fynerdale’s
(EU) rights are protected and guaranteed.*!”

ce. The Tribunal’s Analysis
326. The Tribunal has taken note of the arguments advanced by the Claimant and objected to by the
Respondent. Since, however, the Tribunal holds Article 8 of the Treaty to be applicable it does
not consider it necessary to deal with the arguments exchanged between the Parties as to whether

it must uphold jurisdiction as an exception to the EU Law principle of mutual trust and

recognition.

3. Whether Dutch Law Precludes the Tribunal from Hearing the Dispute

327. The Tribunal will further consider the Parties’ arguments as to whether the laws of the

Netherlands as the /ex loci arbitri precludes the Tribunal from hearing the present dispute.

a. The Respondent’s Position

328. In addition to the arguments above, the Respondent considers that Dutch law prevents the

Tribunal from hearing this dispute because “[t]he CJEU’s interpretations of the EU Treaties have

effect from the moment when the EU law at issue entered into force”,“'’ and Dutch courts are
obliged to give full effect to those decisions. The Respondent thus considers that “the Achmea
Judgment renders the dispute both objectively and subjectively inarbitrable as a matter of Dutch
law, as the /ex loci arbitri, incorporating EU law” and that “any award assuming jurisdiction that
the Tribunal would render, would be set aside by Dutch courts and otherwise [be]

unenforceable”.*!”

(i) There is no Valid Offer to Arbitrate

329. The Respondent notes that, in the Achmea case, the reference to “the law in force of the
Contracting Party concerned” in the applicable law clause of Article 8(6) of the Treaty was read
by the German Federal Court of Justice as meaning that the arbitration agreement was governed
by EU law, which supersedes Member State laws. This is what led it to refer the issue to the
CJEU. The Respondent further underscores that, when considering Article 8(6), the CJEU arrived
to the conclusion that “the arbitral tribunal referred to [...] may be called on to interpret or indeed
to apply EU law”, thus having an “adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law”.’?°

330. In view of the CJEU’s Achmea Judgment, the German Federal Court of Justice ruled on 31
October 2018 that there was no valid offer to arbitrate in the arbitration between the Dutch

company Achmea and the Slovak Republic. This, in the Respondent’s eyes, entails that:

The same reasoning applies to this case. As is clear from the Achmea Judgment, EU law
invalidates the Czech Republic’s offer to arbitrate under article 8 of the BIT.
Consequently, if at the moment Claimant would have allegedly accepted the offer to
arbitrate under article 8 of the BIT, such offer did not exist from the perspective of EU
law and, even if it did (quod non), it could not have been validly accepted.?!

(ii) The Dispute is Objectively Inarbitrable

331. Even ifthe Tribunal were to consider the arbitration agreement to be valid, the Respondent argues
that the dispute would in any event be both objectively and subjectively inarbitrable under the

applicable Dutch arbitration law, and that the Tribunal would accordingly lack jurisdiction.

332. The dispute would be objectively inarbitrable because EU law might apply pursuant to Article
8(6) of the Treaty. Consequently, in the Respondent’s view, the “subject matter is of public policy
nature and may thus not be subjected to arbitration.“

333. Even ifthe Tribunal were to consider that the dispute is arbitrable, the Respondent argues that the
ensuing award issued by the Tribunal would be set aside by the Dutch courts on the ground of
breach of EU public policy, in accordance with Dutch jurisprudence.” In Eco Swiss China Time
v. Benneton International, the Dutch Supreme Court ruled that “[a] national court must grant an
application to set aside an arbitral award if that award is contrary to Article 81 EC (ex Article 85)
if, in accordance with the rules of its national procedural law, it has to grant an application to set
aside the award on the ground that it is contrary to national rules of public policy.”“** Thus, the
arbitration agreement contained in the Treaty would be in any event in violation of EU public
policy (incorporated in Dutch law) and as such objectively inarbitrable.‘?*

334. The Respondent lastly claims that the judgment issued by the Svea Court of Appeals in Poland v.
PL Holdings and relied upon by the Claimant at the Hearing “‘is of little value” in the present case,
considering that this judgment is not final and does not in any event gravitate around the concept

of arbitrability.°°

(iii) The Dispute is Subjectively Inarbitrable

335. The Respondent further argues that the dispute would be subjectively arbitrable under Dutch law
because the Czech Republic does not have the capacity to arbitrate disputes relating to intra-EU
investments.” The Respondent thus argues that the State’s capacity to arbitrate, being governed
by Czech law and thus by EU law, is inexistent pursuant to the Achmea Judgment. Thus, at the
time that the Claimants purportedly accepted the offer to arbitrate contained in Article 8, the offer

no longer existed under Czech law and BU law.*?*

336. Anticipating a possible objection from the Claimant based on the so-called Lizardi rule,”? which

is enshrined in Article 10.167 of the Dutch Code of Civil Procedure (“DCCP”), the Respondent

raises three counter-arguments. First, according to the Respondent, “the principle of supremacy
of EU law prevents Claimant from relying on the Lizardi rule”: Dutch law cannot lead to the
violation of EU law.**° Second, this rule is inapplicable, because it relates only to the application
of a State’s own domestic law.“*! In this case, on the contrary, the Respondent is relying

432

exclusively on the EU law." Finally, the Respondent considers that the Claimant was aware of

the risks that the standing offer to arbitrate held in the Treaty might be incompatible with EU law,

something that had been “questioned since the mid-2000s.”**3

(iv) Conclusion

337. Pursuant to the above, the Respondent considers that, if the Tribunal were to hold it has
jurisdiction in the present dispute, the Award on Jurisdiction would likely be set aside in the
Netherlands.*™ Invoking “a generally accepted principle that arbitrators must make every effort
to ensure that their awards are enforceable at law”, the Respondent considers that the Tribunal

must deny jurisdiction in accordance with EU law and pursuant to the Achmea Judgment.**°

b. The Claimant’s position

338. The Claimant refutes the Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal cannot hear the present dispute

under Dutch law.

(i) There is a Valid Arbitration Agreement

339. The Claimant considers that, since the arbitration agreement in the present case is valid, there
would be no reason for a court to set aside an arbitral award assuming jurisdiction on the basis of

Article 1065(1)(a) DCCP.°°
340. Article 1065 DCCP provides as follows:

1. A reversal of the award can take place only on one or more of the following grounds:
(a) absence of a valid arbitration agreement;

(b) the arbitral tribunal was constituted in violation of the rules applicable thereto;

(c) the arbitral tribunal has not complied with its mandate;

(d) the award is not signed or does not contain reasons in accordance with the

submitted to it, the application for a reversal on the ground mentioned in paragraph (1)(c)
above shall be admissible only if an additional award mentioned in Article 1061(1) is

arbitration in a civil-law sen se, wh ich w ould lead to the arbitral tribunal having no

(ii) The Dispute is Objectively Arbitrable

The Claimant further argues that the dispute is in itself objectively arbitrable. Citing Article
1020(3) DCCP, which provides that “[t]he arbitration agreement shall not serve to determine legal
consequences of which the parties cannot freely dispose”, the Claimant claims that “a matter or
dispute is non-arbitrable if the parties may not validly reach a settlement between them in relation
to [it]”.“° Since disputes arising under the Treaty can be amicably settled between an investor
and the State, such disputes remain arbitrable.“"!

Additionally, in the Claimant’s view, the present dispute “does not have an erga omnes effect”
and consequently is not a matter of public policy. Relying on Article 1020(3) DCCP as well as

oe 2
on Supreme Court jurisprudence,”

the Claimant alleges that “a matter or dispute is of a public
policy nature if the decision to be rendered in the proceedings necessarily has erga omnes
effects”.“? Disputes relating to public international law are always arbitrable under Dutch law,
including disputes under BITs.““* The Achmea Judgment has no bearing on this fact: the Claimant
argues that the CJEU’s decision “does not form any indication that a dispute arising out of a
bilateral investment treaty is non-arbitrable under Dutch law.” In any event, “the settlement of
a matter or dispute under an intra-EU BIT is not of a public policy nature.”“° Even if public policy
rules applied, the matter would remain arbitrable, and arbitrators should merely apply the rules.
Should they not do so, their award could be set aside by the courts, thus safeguarding the

application of those rules.“”

In any event, the Claimant finds support for its position in the judgment of the Svea Court of
Appeal of 22 February 2019 relating to the annulment petition for the award in PL Holdings v.
Poland.*** The court indeed considered that the dispute was arbitrable, considering that
arbitrability is a matter of substance, and that in that case, the question was one of breach of

“contract” and of the related compensation.” The Claimant considers that the present Tribunal,

like that in PL Holdings v. Poland , is asked “to rule on a state’s liability for the breach of an
international treaty and on the reparation/damages that follow.’”**° Considering the similarities
between the Swedish and the Dutch arbitration laws, the conclusion under the Dutch legal system

should be the same as under the Swedish system. *!

(iii) The Dispute is Subjectively Arbitrable

346. The Claimant also contests the Respondent’s argument that the dispute is subjectively not

arbitrable. Indeed, the DCCP sets out no conditions with regard to a party’s capacity to enter into

452

an arbitration agreement:*” it suffices for a party to have legal capacity, in order to have capacity

to enter in an arbitration agreement.**? Considering that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU have no
horizontal direct effect and cannot have any impact on civil rights, the Claimant argues that the
Achmea Judgment “does not have any effect on the capacity of the Czech Republic to conclude
ood

an arbitration agreement.

(iv) Conclusion

347. Considering the above, the Claimant concludes that Dutch courts are unlikely to set aside the
Tribunal’s award on jurisdiction if it were to accept jurisdiction over the present dispute. The

Claimant argues that Article 1065 is not a proper ground for setting aside an award.

348. The Claimant further concludes, in its Post-Hearing Brief, that an award assuming jurisdiction
would be enforceable because the Respondent would not be entitled to “invoke public policy as
ground for refusal of enforcement (Article V(2) New York Convention) as the decision in Achmea

Judgment is not based on the fact that the arbitral tribunal infringed a rule of substantive EU

law.7455

349. In any event, whether or not the award is enforceable is not relevant for the Tribunal to uphold

jurisdiction.**° Similarly, even if the award were not enforceable in the Netherlands, this would

not entail that the award is unenforceable in all jurisdictions.*"” Consequently, the Tribunal should

uphold jurisdiction.

The Tribunal’s Analysis

350. The Tribunal emphasizes that the seat of the arbitration is The Hague, and that, accordingly the

351.

457

DCCP applies to the present procedure as the /ex loci arbitri . While this is common ground
between the Parties, they differ as to the consequences of the application of the provisions of the
DCCP, in particular with regard to the validity of the offer to arbitrate and the arbitrability of the
dispute.

The Respondent’s argument, based upon the alleged non-arbitrability of the dispute under the
laws of the Netherlands, turns on the proposition that the dispute is outside the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal by virtue of EU law and that of the Netherlands as the /ex /oci arbitri, and the Tribunal
must therefore treat the dispute as non-arbitrable. The Tribunal has found that EU law does not
deprive it of jurisdiction,‘** and accordingly, as already indicated above, the jurisdictional
objection based on the laws of the Netherlands must also fail in Jimine. However, the Tribunal

considers it necessary to add several considerations.

(a) First, the Tribunal would like to emphasize that one of the first decisions taken after the
establishment of the Tribunal was the decision, with the concurrence of the Parties, to
select The Hague as its seat. If the Respondent were correct in stating that the Tribunal
lacked jurisdiction from the outset, such decision and its consequences, namely the

applicability of Dutch law, would be void. Such result would be devoid of logic.

(

g

Second, the system of investment arbitration is meant to establish an independent
adjudication procedure. Therefore, any reference to the /ex loci arbitri should be
interpreted in a way that does not put the independent existence of the Tribunal into
jeopardy. This, however, would be the case if the jurisdiction of an investment arbitral
tribunal would be made dependent upon the /ex /oci arbitri. The Tribunal is inclined to
think that, while the /ex loci arbitri may affect the arbitrability of a dispute, it will not

deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction to rule on its own competence.

(

2

Third, as far as the argument of the Respondent that an award would not be enforceable

is concerned, the Tribunal feels bound to point out that enforceability cannot dominate

PCA 295083 95

353.

jurisdiction since this would, in violation of the independent existence of the Tribunal,
render the jurisdiction of the latter dependent upon national law. Further, the Tribunal
considers it appropriate to add that the Respondent has not convincingly argued why
the Dutch Court of Appeal would have to reverse a decision on jurisdiction accepting
jurisdiction in the present case. The reference to Article 1065 DCCP is not sufficient.
Finally, it should be added that the Respondent’s arguments do not take into
consideration the possibility of enforcing the award in a State other than the Kingdom

of the Netherlands, which means the alleged non-arbitrability would not be unlimited.

As far as the subjective non-arbitrability is concerned, as claimed by the Respondent, it is in the
view of the Tribunal sufficient that the Claimant has the legal capacity to undertake investments,

on the basis of an investment agreement. Such capacity has not been called into question.

On the basis of the above, the Tribunal holds that the dispute is objectively and subjectively

arbitrable.
THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE

The Respondent further challenges the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae, considering that
the alleged investment was made illegally in the Czech Republic and is thus not protected by the
Treaty. In any event, the Respondent contends that at least part of the investment allegedly made
by the Claimant — that part invested “through” Poppyseed — is not protected by the Treaty. Should
the Tribunal accept jurisdiction, the Respondent considers that it should then hold the Claimant’s

demands to be inadmissible.“

The Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction because its investment, including that
made “through” Poppyseed, was made in compliance with Czech laws and thus falls under the
protection granted by the Treaty. The Claimant further notes that “the allegations of illegality
presented by the Czech Republic in the case at hand relate to a part of Fynerdale’s investment
only, which is all the more reason to decide on the allegations on illegality not in this jurisdiction

phase but in the merits (quantum) phase."

1. Burden of Proof

While the Parties agree that the party alleging particular facts has to afford prima facie evidence
of those facts, the Parties disagree on whether the burden of proof may shift to another party in
the event that one of the Parties provides prima facie evidence alleging illegal conduct by the

other party."°!

a. The Respondent’s Position

Alleging that the Claimant’s investment was a money-laundering mechanism following “one of
the largest frauds in the history of the Czech Republic”, the Respondent notes that “it only is
required to provide prima facie evidence for the fact that the funds used for the payments originate

in criminal activities”, and are thus in breach of Czech law.

The Respondent relies on Karkey v. Pakistan to assert that “the burden shifts to the investor once
the host state has presented prima facie evidence on the commission of corruption or fraud." In
the present case, the Respondent alleges that it “will raise a number of red flags, making the
conclusion inevitable that Claimant has invested the proceeds of a crime” and that “because part

of this criminal behaviour was the concealment of the streams of funds, the burden to disprove

the case put to the Tribunal shifts to Claimant."

The Respondent considers that burden shifting is “the appropriate solution for dealing with the
issue of the inherently elusive nature of the illegality of Claimant’s ‘investment’”,*® for several

reasons.

First, the Respondent notes that there is a broad consensus that shifting the burden of proof is
appropriate in cases where there is a “near impossibility to ‘prove’ illegal acts like corruption,

fraud or money laundering”.“°° The Respondent further argues that “[t]he accused party is simply

in a better position to refute criminal allegations and prove not only its innocence, but also the
legitimacy of its investment”.“”’ The present case is a perfect study for this reasoning, according
to the Respondent, considering the “intricate web of co-dependent companies” created by the

Claimant’s UBOs.

The Respondent further asserts the idea that “international arbitration proceedings are especially
susceptible to be misused as a vehicle for enforcing claims tainted with illegality”.“* Given the
limited coercive powers of arbitral tribunals — as opposed to domestic State courts — the
Respondent argues that it falls upon the Claimant to disprove the allegations of criminal acts that
are sustained by a number of elements of proof gathered in criminal proceedings held by “courts

of a completely neutral state, i.e. Switzerland.“

Second, the Respondent makes the argument that, given that neither the Treaty, nor the applicable
laws to this arbitration contain specific rules on the burden of proof, “nothing prevents the
Tribunal from shifting the burden of proof from the alleging party to the denying party under
99470

certain circumstances’

Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules as allowing a tribunal to shift the burden of proof “once a

472

— such as those in the case at hand.‘”! Thus, the Respondent interprets

certain — lower — standard of proof has been met by the alleging party. Such analysis is

TB 6,

supported by a number of decisions in both treaty-based and commercial arbitrations,’ “where

there is a difficulty of obtaining direct evidence related to an alleged illegal act once the alleging

party has provided prima facie evidence in the form of red flags.”*” In the Respondent’s view:

Such special circumstances are clearly given in the present case. Claimant’s investment is
connected to one of the most massive frauds committed in the Czech Republic, which

raises bright red flags clearly suggesting Claimant’s subsequent participation in a grand
money laundering operation.75

In response to the Claimant’s counterarguments, the Respondent underscores that, if the tribunal
in Karkey v. Pakistan did indeed disregard the State’s arguments on the illegality of the
investment, this was “because Pakistan had only made these allegations ‘last minute’ and that
they were ‘based on manoeuvres by persons [...] which were more probably aimed at extorting
money from Pakistan or at derailing the arbitration proceedings than at genuinely allowing
corruption to be established’.”*”° The Respondent further notes that the Claimant’s counter-
example of Hamester v. Ghana is that of a “rare exception to a general trend that investment

tribunals draw conclusions on the basis of adverse inference if the alleging party meets a prima

facie standard of proof”.4””

The existence of red flags, in the Respondent’s view, allows arbitrators to “make a procedural
presumption that a party’s transaction or investment is unlawful and shift the burden of proof to

the accused party to present the counter-evidence.”*”* Citing the ICJ Judgment in Corfu

1479 480

Channel,"” as well as two treaty-based investment arbitration cases,"" the Respondent argues

that indirect and circumstantial evidence should be taken into account by the Tribunal in making

its award on jurisdiction.’

In conclusion, the Respondent considers that “shifting the burden of proof is the obvious and
appropriate solution to the problem that acts of corruption fraud and money laundering are

intrinsically designed to be unprovable, which is why Respondent is not in a position to provide

direct evidence concerning the illegality of Claimant’s investment.“

b. — The Claimant’s Position

366. The Claimant asserts that “the full burden of proving the alleged illegality is on the Czech
Republic.”“* In support of this assertion, the Claimant first relies on Article 24(1) of the

UNCITRAL Rules,*** which is in its view “the reflection of the long established practice of

international courts and tribunals that ‘the party that asserts must prove’. 20485

367. The Claimant contends that this principle, also set out in a number of other legal instruments, ‘**

has mainly a procedural function, with a consequence with regard to evidence: “if a party fails to
provide evidential support for its allegations without a satisfactory explanation, the allegations
will be unproved and therefore dismissed.”"*’ According to the Respondent, both UNCITRAL,

and ICSID Tribunals “have adopted a general assumption that prima facie evidence submitted by

the claimant is generally insufficient to shift the burden of proof to respondent.”***

368. The Claimant cites in this regard the award in Gavrilovic v. Croatia,**’ another Achmea case. In
this case, the tribunal relied on previous jurisprudence to hold “that the proposition that the

investor would have to somehow prove it has complied with the myriad laws and regulations of

the host state is unrealistic and the burden of proof must therefore naturally rest with the party
490

alleging a breach of the legality requirement (the host state).
The Claimant further states that “[i]t would also be inconsistent with the object and purpose of a
BIT if host states would be able to invoke the legality requirement as an excuse to avoid its
international responsibility.”“°' Consequently, it argues, “when investor wrongdoing is raised as
a defence, the burden of proof of such illegality is on the host state” — in this case, the Czech

Republic.‘

In the case at hand, the Claimant argues that the Czech Republic failed to meet the threshold set
out by the tribunal in Karkey v. Pakistan for a shift in the burden of proof, i.e. that of “unequivocal

"3 prima facie evidence. The Claimant alleges that, quite to the contrary,

(or unambiguous)
the Respondent has failed to produce substantive evidence of the alleged illegal or criminal
actions, which is “even more striking as the Czech Republic has a number of tools for tracking
down and securing proceeds of a crime.“

The Claimant thus considers that, even though the Respondent had the ability to confirm its
allegations, “it failed to prove any causal link between the alleged illegality and Fynerdale’s
investment in the present arbitration” and “neither the UBO’s of Fynerdale, nor Fynerdale itself
have been found guilty for the alleged illegal activities in the Czech Republic.“ According to
the Claimant, the Respondent’s argument that it would be close to impossible to prove the
Claimant’s illegal acts should fail, as the Respondent has access to a number of means that should
enable it to acquire the required elements of proof to support its claims, including specialized

investigative forces and access to international legal assistance in tracing financial information.”

The Claimant therefore rejects the Respondent’s arguments on the shifting of the burden of proof
as baseless and considers that the Respondent’s argument with respect to the shifting of the burden

of proof should be dismissed.

However, in the alternative that the Tribunal decides to shift the burden of proof to Fynerdale, the

Claimant, relying on Karkey v. Paki stan,***

argues that the Respondent has not provided
“sufficient ground for a reasonable belief that the funds used by Fynerdale to provide loans were
obtained by criminal activities as it did not provide unequivocal (or unambiguous) prima facie
evidence of the illegality of the investment.”

The Claimant affirms that it fully complied with the Tribunal’s order relating to document
production,” as detailed in the reports submitted with its document production, which showed
Fynerdale’s best efforts to obtain the required documents. **' Thus, Fynerdale notes that it
produced a total of 302 files in response to the Czech Republic’s 11 document requests,*°? which
were obtained thanks to the collaboration of a number of persons and entities.’ Where it could
not produce responsive documents, the Claimant provided an explanation for that absence. The
Claimant further explains that the documents the Claimant had intended to produce in August
2020 were identified following Mr. Ds requests upon his engagement in March 2020 and
retrieved once the location where the hard copies of the documents were held became accessible

again."

In any event, the Claimant argues, “‘a failure to produce documents does not shift the burden of

proof on to the defaulting party and any resulting adverse inference is likely to carry less weight

than other direct evidence.”*°*

2. Legality of Fynerdale’s Investment under Article 2 of the Treaty
Article 2 of the Treaty provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote investments by investors of the other
Contracting Party and shall admit such investments in accordance with its provisions of

the rule of law, which entails that a court or tribunal cannot grant assistance to a party that has

engaged in a corrupt act.”*!4

This reasoning applies to the present case, the Respondent argues, since the State “was not in any

way involved in Claimant’s illegal acts but — to the complete opposite — was the victim of the

fraud underlying the money laundering operation in which Claimant plays a vital part.”*'>

In the present case, the Respondent states:

the Claimant cannot invoke the protection of the BIT because [...] it is linked in a plethora
of ways to a fraud and money laundering case committed in the context of the privatization
ofa large Czech company. The persons and companies involved in the commission of the
crime are also the persons who provided the funds invested in the present case. Funds were
then transferred by corporate vehicles used by those criminals to Claimant, which then
“invested” them in the Czech Republic. The investments violated fundamental rules of
Czech Criminal law when being made.5'°

Responding to the Claimant’s arguments at the hearing based on the decision in OKO v. Estonia,
where “the tribunal ruled that illegality of part of the investment does not render the entire
investment illegal”,* the Respondent notes that, in that case, the issue at hand was related to the
invalidity of ancillary contracts, not a violation of the host State’s law further to a criminal act.>'*
In the case at hand, the issue is quite distinct, as it is “a ‘taint’ that spreads across the entire
transaction.”5!”

The Respondent compares the Claimant’s argument with that made in the case of World Duty
Free v. Kenya in which the claimant admitted making a bribe in connection with the investment
but argued that the bribe was only a small separate part of the investment, which should be
addressed separately in respect of jurisdictional considerations.*”° The tribunal in that matter

disagreed with the claimant’s proposition and ruled that, considering that the bribe and the

investment were one transaction, the investment had been made in violation of the host state’s

law.*?!

The Respondent argues that the 2017 Swiss Supreme Court Judgment, by which Fynerdale’s

UBOs were convicted for money-laundering and fraud,” “raise[s] numerous very obvious red
flags indicating clearly that the funds used by Claimant in the present case were proceeds from
his [sic] criminal activities, which were supposed to be laundered in the Czech Republic by

Claimant’s ‘investments’.”*”> The Respondent underscores that sections 216 and 217 of the Czech

Criminal Code specifically sanction money laundering.*™

The Respondent alleges that Fynerdale granted large loans to Ytrix and Poppyseed, without there
being any explanation as to the provenance of the money.**> As previously mentioned, the
Respondent considers that the purpose of the poppy seed trade and related loans from Fynerdale
was to launder money from the alleged MUS Fraud. Fynerdale would thus lend the funds received
from the MUS Fraud to Ytrix and Poppyseed. Then, in due course, Ytrix and Poppyseed would

reimburse the loans — thus completing the money laundering scheme.*”°

The transaction chain had originally been concealed,*?’ and was only revealed further to the
forensic investigations of the Respondent’s Expert. The Respondent argues that the missing

evidence of central documents, such as credit agreements for the loans, suggests that the Claimant

3 528

is “unable or unwilling to establish the source of the funds used in the alleged investment”.

In the Respondent’s view, the illegality of Fynerdale’s activity is also evident from the lack of
interest shown by Fynerdale in the poppy seed business: had there been any real interest in the
business, then Fynerdale would have been aware that it was unrealistic to buy 123.9 tons of poppy
seed between 2007 and 2010.*” This is further buttressed, the Respondent says, by the absence

of evidence showing the commercial rationale of the purchase of the entire harvest of poppy seed

and of any form of security for the loans.**° Indeed, the very structure of the investment

mechanism appears to be “highly suspicious”:

The scheme shows quite clearly that the middle part of the diagram from Ytrix until
Tadorna is redundant and does not serve any economic purpose. All poppy seed purchased
from the farmers would be processed and stored in the warehouses of Mr. —_ until
its sale to the end-purchasers regardless of which of the companies in_the ‘was the
owner at a given moment. If the scheme operated as described, Ne would be
essentially selling the poppy seed from himself to himself while also performing the
economic activity (soring, cleaning, mixing and packaging) himself. The involvement of
Ytrix, Poppyseed and Tadorna served no purpose whatsoever because Mr. with
had all the means necessary to operate the scheme alone.*

 

The Respondent contends that “[i]f the purpose of Claimant’s involvement was to provide the
necessary capital for the trade, almost any other method would be cheaper and safer for the
investor.” Consequently, the Respondent considers that “the poppy seed trading scheme lacked
any commercial sense from the very beginning” and that “[s]imilarly senseless were also all
subsequent decisions that Claimant and its UBOs made in reaction to the supposed developments
on the market.”>*

The Respondent asserts that a “[r]easonable businessman would never agree to invest CZK 3
billion in unsecured loans to a scheme where all control is allocated to independent third parties

and all the risk stays with the investor.”***

Reviewing the evidence at hand, the Respondent argues that the alleged fraud could and should
have been discovered sooner by the Claimant’s representatives*™ and that, in any event, the
Claimant never argued nor produced evidence proving that it had pursued an economic analysis

of the poppy seed market or performed due diligence in respect of the Poppy Seed Merchants or

   

. «53
of their companies.**°

 

Consequently:

Mr. an: assertion that earlier discovery of the fraud was impossible is simply
incorrect. Claimant had numerous opportunities to adopt a minimum standard of business
vigilance, which would be expected of a company making investments in the range of
billions. However, Claimant did no such thing and allowed the fraud to continue.5

393. Because certain loans were never paid back, the Claimant was unable to recover the money which
it was attempting to launder. Thus, the “Claimant is now asking for damages from the Czech state
as reparation for a failed money laundering transaction.”**”

394. The illegality of the investment is evident when one considers the provenance of the funds, as
established in the ft Expert Report based on the documents produced during the
document production phase. The Respondent thus asserts that the fe Expert Report
shows that the Claimant’s funds for Loan 3 were derived from the MUS Fraud, transferred to
Fynerdale through an intricate series of operations and through the conduit of various
companies.*** The conclusions of the Expert Report also support the view that other

loans issued by Fynerdale were also derived from the MUS Fraud.

395. At the issue of the Hearing, the Respondent notes that the Claimant’s expert “using additional
documents received from Claimant (but not disclosed to Respondent or the Tribunal) managed to
establish with certainty that the funds used for Loan 3 were proceeds of the MUS fraud.”*”? It thus
considers that it is “an undisputed fact” that part of Loan 3 was funded with funds derived from a

criminal operation.”

396. Thus, relying on Exhibit VEC-17 (issued from the Claimant’s document production), the
Respondent’s Expert established that there was a direct flow of funds from MUS to the company

Mostra, which eventually funded the issuance of Loan 3:*"

The Claimant’s argument that Loan 3 should be distinguished from the other loans and only forms

assertions.*?
The Respondent concludes that:

[I]t is irrelevant whether only a part of the funds used in Claimant's alleged investment
was sourced in a crime, because the result is no jurisdiction over the entire investment
scheme. Firstly, because under the BIT, in cases of fraud, corruption or money laundering
the one illegal part taints the entire investment with illegality. Secondly, because
concealment of origin of criminal proceeds in a form of mixing with legitimate funds
renders the entire transaction a crime under Czech law.*

(ii) Loans 1-2 and 4-9

The Respondent considers that the existence of the first two loans is unproven: “Loan | and Loan
2 were the only ones where Claimant was unable to present a single relevant document showing
that these transactions have ever taken place. [...] Claimant was not even able to show account

statements showing the transfer of the funds from its account to the account of Aida and Ytrix.”*“*

At the Hearing, Mr. HEE plained that the accounts from which Loan 3 had been paid had
been frozen due to the Swiss proceedings. Ata later stage, Loans 4 to 9 were paid through another

bank account, after said freezing of the account. The Respondent thus concludes:

The freezing of accounts thus served as a certain turning point when the sources of funding
switched. If Loan I and Loan 2 ever existed, they were provided prior to this turning point
and, therefore, likely used the same financing channel as Loan 3, which was sourced in
the MUS fraud. This would also provide a background for Claimant's otherwise
inexplicable failure to present a single piece of evidence pertaining to Loans | and 2.5

 

Considering that Loan 4 was funded through Skoda dividends, the Respondent considers that it
was indirectly funded by the proceedings from the MUS fraud.**° Loan 5, however, is in the

Respondent’s view “likely at least partially sourced in the MUS fraud”.*4”

Loans 6 to 9 were transferred through the company Appian Services (Cyprus) Ltd., which was an

548

active participant in the MUS Fraud.*"* However, only the flow of funds is proven, and sometimes

only partially; the source of these loans is unknown.*””
According to the Respondent,

Claimant has not provided sufficient information to enable Respondent and the experts to
trace back most of the funds to their very origins, despite having been granted several
extensions of the document production deadlines. Claimant, instead of producing evidence
to rebut Respondent’s submissions and thereby establishing that the invested funds were
obtained legally, simply sticks its head in the sand. This of course makes sense as it has
become evident that Claimant’s investment is indeed part of a grand money laundering
scheme.5°

In the Respondent’s view, “if Claimant committed money laundering even with regard to one of
the loans forming its investment, the entire investment is tainted and will not be protected under

the BIT”:**!

[I]n cases of bribery, the illegality does not only concem the funds used for the illicit

purpose alone but the entire investment connected to such behaviour is illegal. Applied to

the present case, it is not relevant whether the proceeds of a crime form 1% or 100% of

the transactions involved in the granting of the Loans. Regardless of the percentage, the

entire investment is illegal because it is all part of one criminal transaction.*>
The Respondent asserts that the explanations provided by the Claimant with regard to the origin
of the funds — i.e. dividends paid out by Skoda Holding — are unsupported by any evidence:**?
thus, only one loan can be traced back to the Skoda group, although the origins of the funds are
unclear even in that case.*** The Respondent notes that Fynerdale’s UBOs have in the past

repeatedly relied on the Skoda brand, left untainted, to cover for their transactions.**>

While it may not be possible to trace back of the origin of the funds to the MUS Fraud with full
certainty, the above elements all represent red flags. While these may not be direct proof of the
illegality of the Claimant’s investment, they provide sufficient evidence, under a prima facie
standard of proof, to determine that there is a connection between the criminal activities of

Fynerdale’s UBOs and the sums granted as loans to Ytrix and Poppyseed.*°°

ii) Request for Adverse Inferences in Respect of the Legality of the Loans

The Respondent further requests the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences on account of what the

Respondent perceives to be an incomplete document production by the Claimant, noting that:

Where at least some documents were provided, they were delayed, did not relate to
Respondent's requests and showed signs of tampering. Emails were copied into word
documents to hide metadata, which would allow Respondent to verify the timing and the
identities of the senders and the addressees. Account statements suspiciously started after
or ended before the relevant transfers took place. Almost all contractual documentation
between the funding entities was allegedly lost or was inaccessible.5"”

At the Hearing, the Respondent notes that a number of elements were brought to light: the
Claimant’s Expert was provided with documents that were not handed over to the Respondent’s

Expert and the Claimant further admitted that it had tardily requested documents for the document

production phase from a third party and that, upon receiving a new trove of documents in June
2020, had waited to assess and select “a small amount of documents” until August 2020, eleven
days before the hearing, before submitting them to the Tribunal and the Respondent.***

The Respondent notes that the Tribunal is empowered to draw adverse inferences further to the
applicable UNCITRAL Rules and paragraphs 5.3.7 and 6.1 of its Procedural Order No. 1.5°° In

particular, the Respondent submits:

Since Claimant failed to comply with the majority of the granted document re-quests
relating to the illegality of Claimant’s investment, the Tribunal should draw the following
adverse inferences:

derived from crimes for which Messrs and have been found guilty by the

- The loans provided by Claimant — the alleged investment in the present case
Swiss Supreme Court (Document Requests No 1-5).

- Claimant has not taken an informed business decision when making its “investment”

based on advice from Mr Mr and Ms (Document Request

No 6)
The Respondent contends that, as a result of the incomplete and tardy documentation submitted
by the Claimant, “it has been extremely difficult to ascertain all the details of Claimant’s alleged
investment”.**! It further alleges that the Claimant failed to provide “missing evidence and
demonstrate that the investment was more than a money laundering attempt gone wrong”*” even

after the Tribunal posed questions after the Hearing.

The Respondent thus alleges that “[a]fter a purposefully and repeatedly delayed document

production phase, Claimant has hardly any documents that dismiss the concerns raised in

connection with the illegal nature of its investment. Some documents, to the contrary, have

proven the Respondent’s assertion that Fynerdale’s alleged investment was derived from
illegally-acquired funds. Overall, while there may be insufficient hard evidence to prove that
the totality of Fynerdale’s alleged investment was derived from funds arising from the MUS

Fraud, the Respondent underscores that “criminal proceeds in an amount strikingly close [to] the

the fact that “vr and Mr Have repeatedly lied to the Czech police about their

relationship with Claimant and that the poppy seed investment scheme does not make any

economic senses as was pointed out in the [2018 Czech Decision].”>

414. Based on the above-mentioned references, the Respondent considers that the “prevailing line of
jurisprudence” is that a tribunal lacks jurisdiction over claims relating to an illegal investment.>”

As such, the illegality of the investment made by Fynerdale in the present case necessarily entails

that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant’s case.°”!

415. Alternatively, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should dismiss the Claimant’s claims as

572

inadmissible, similar to what the tribunal in Malicorp v. Egypt did.’ In accordance with the

“clean-hands principle”, the Claimant, in introducing this arbitration, “can only rely on its
substantive legal rights if it has not engaged in [...] significant misconduct”.*” Other tribunals
have thus concluded that this principle can be applied whether or not the underlying treaty — be it

a BIT or the Energy Charter Treaty — includes a requirement that the investor act in accordance

with domestic law.*” Because the Claimant has come to this arbitration with ‘unclean hands’, its

claims should be held inadmissible, even if the Tribunal were to uphold jurisdiction.

In the present case, the Treaty contains “an express compliance clause, requiring investors to

3 575

adhere to the law of the host state”.°’° In such cases, the Tribunal should find — as other tribunals

before it — that it lacks jurisdiction. Alternatively, should the Tribunal find it has jurisdiction, it

should dismiss the Claimant’s claims as inadmissible.°”°

b. — The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant denies that it violated Czech law when it made its investment in the Czech
Republic.*”’ Not only is the evidence submitted by the Czech Republic to support its allegations

very limited,*” but in addition, the findings of the Swiss Supreme Court, on which the Respondent

relies, are “highly controversial.”°”

The Claimant contends that judgment is the result of Swiss proceedings that took place amidst
“extreme political pressure” from the United States. The Swiss prosecutor’s office and the judges’
behaviour in this case were the source of criticism — in particular, the Claimant points out that one
of the three Swiss judges ruling on the case publicly stated his concerns with regard to the respect
of due process. *° Moreover, important evidence was either dismissed or improperly
administered.**' In light of all of these reasons, the Claimant considers that “the judgment of the

Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland cannot be used as evidence that the funding of Loan 3

derives from proceedings from the MUS transaction.”**”

Currently, analogous proceedings are pending before the Czech courts, where evidence left

unheard in Switzerland is being taken into account.**?

The Claimant argues, furthermore, that the Respondent is precluded from relying on the defence
of illegality on the basis that it was itself involved in the alleged illegality through the conduct of
its government representatives. *** Relying on the Articles on Responsibility of States for
Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the International Law Commission and the award in
EDF vy. Romania, the Claimant contends that “‘a public official's solicitation of a bribe is, as the
EDF tribunal stated, a ‘fundamental breach of transparency and legitimate expectations’ and,
hence, a violation of the FET standard included in Article 3(1) of the Treaty.**5

The Claimant contends that the 2016 Czech Decision, submitted into evidence by the Respondent,
“expressly proves” that the alleged crimes regarding the MUS purchase involved wrongdoings of
the representatives of the Czech Government. According to the decision, the sale of the MUS
Shares by the Czech Government was made at a low price on the basis of erroneous information
and “interventions” from the Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade.**°

In any case, the Claimant argues that the Respondent fails to meet the applicable heightened
standard of proof, “as it fails to provide any unequivocal direct evidence that the investments
made by Fynerdale are in violation of Czech law.”**’ This question of the standard of proof, which
is not governed by Article 24 of the UNCITRAL Rules, is important in cases such as the one at
hand, “where the host state makes (serious) allegations of wrongdoing such as criminal acts, fraud,
corruption and other similar acts, international courts and tribunals have required a heightened
standard of proof.”*** The appropriate standards in these cases were those of “clear and
convincing evidence” or “beyond reasonable doubt”.**”

Indeed, the Claimant argues that the illegal origin of the funds has never been proven and is in
fact highly implausible.*” In 2011, the Claimant points out, Fynerdale’s accounts in the Czech

Republic were examined by the Department of Financial Analysis of the Ministry of Finance: the

examination did not reveal any mishandlings by the Claimant, but contributed to the identification

of the Ponzi scheme developed by the Poppy Seed Merchants.**' It is in this context that the

Claimant was awarded damages further to the judgment of the Prague Municipal Court.*?

As for the Respondent’s observation that Fynerdale provided its loans without security, the

Claimant considers that this is of no relevance:

[T]here were no reasons for Fynerdale to secure the Loans as Fynerdale always had control
over Poppysced and all the financial transactions made by Poppyseed via, for example,
the credit agreements. Furthermore, Poppyseed was a special purpose vehicle with no
assets that could not be the object of a pledge. For that reason, it is standard practice that
an investor does not secure funds provided to its special purpose vehicle.5

 

Similarly, the Respondent’s questioning of the commercial rationale of the Claimant’s investment
and investment structure is inapposite. Not only was the interest for such a structure
acknowledged by the Municipal Court of Prague,*” but it was moreover confirmed by both
experts in the proceedings as a common structure that could be “used in legitimate businesses and
in legitimate practices.”°°°

In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent’s reliance on the 2013 Swiss Federal Court Judgment and
on the 2016 and 2018 Decisions is similarly inapposite, as none of them supply the relevant

evidence to show that Fynerdale’s investments were made contrary to Czech law:

(a) The 2013 Swiss Federal Court Judgment did not find that the funds used to acquire the

Skoda shares originated in criminal proceedings.°°°

(b) The 2016 Czech Decision “does not establish that proceeds of MUS were used to obtain
any Skoda assets or that any other crime was committed with respect to the sale of
Skoda assets.”**” Thus, this decision did not establish that there was bribery or money

laundering.

(c) In the 2018 Czech Decision, which does not concern Loans 1, 2, 3, 7, 8, or 9,58 the
Czech police reached the conclusion that (i) “there was no crime of legalizing the

proceeds of crime committed” and (ii) “there was no suspicion of a criminal offense of

evasion of taxes and similar mandatory payments.”°°?

In any event, the Claimant argues that the 2016 and 2018 Czech Decisions are not binding on the

Tribunal and should not lead it to deny jurisdiction.°°

The Claimant notes that Ms. s testimony at the Hearing made it “obvious [...] that

her instructions were not aimed at establishing the facts but at trying to establish whether certain

allegations of the Czech Republic ‘cannot be excluded’ .”°"!

Relying on the || Expert Report, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has failed to

provide any evidence supporting its allegations:

For eight of the nine loans the Czech Republic expert report fails to provide any evidence
that might serve its objective. Only loan 3 is challenged, based on Exhibit VEC-17 to the
K2 report. I was able to confirm all flows of funds as stated on Exhibit VEC-17 with bank
statements [.] Therefore I concur with the conclusion of the Czech Republic expert on loan
3 being funded by ‘MUS’ proceedings. However, the assumption of the Czech Republic
expert that she “cannot exclude the possibility that” funds of all other loans have derived
from the ‘MUS’ proceedings, based on her findings to loan 3, is simply invalid, while
there is no indication that loan 3 is in anyway interconnected to other loans. On the
contrary, I identified legitimate sources of funds following from Skoda Group
dividends.

In any event, the Claimant argues that the allegations of illegality should not have any incidence
on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae. Referring to the 1963 decision issued by Judge

Gunnar Lagergren in Argentine Engineer v. British Company , cited by the Tribunal during the

603

course of the hearing,””’ the Claimant considers that the sole arbitrator’s decision in that case to

rule that he lacked jurisdiction over the dispute represents an outdated reasoning.

(i) Loan3

431. The Claimant notes that this was a single loan, “granted under a separate loan agreement and in a

o 605

separate timeframe distinguished from other loans. It further underscores that the

Respondent’s expert herself was able to link only this one loan — out of the nine loans granted by
Fynerdale — to the MUS privatization. During the course of her examination, Ms.
“recognized [...] that she was able to identify only part of Loan 3 as being funded by MUS funds
(only CZK 330 million out of CZK 667,5 million).”® However, the Claimant notes, this is only
part of the investment made by Fynerdale in the Czech Republic.”

432. The Claimant refutes that Loan 3 was funded by funds originating in the MUS privatization.“

Disputing that the notion of legality of the investment should be interwoven with the definition

609

of investment,” the Claimant further argues that

even if the Tribunal finds that Loan 3 is contrary to the host law in the meaning of the
Treaty, this does not mean that the whole investment of Fynerdale is illegal under the
Treaty. To withdraw the protection of the Treaty on this basis would be inconsistent with
the object and purpose of the Treaty. Denying protection under the Treaty to all
Fynerdale’s Loans based on a potential finding of illegality with respect to Loan 3 would
be a disproportionate response under the circumstances and would be factually wrong."

433. The Claimant thus concludes that the Tribunal should review the separate origins of the various
loans in order to assess the potential impact of the alleged illegality of Loan 3. In any event, the
Claimant considers that the Respondent ought to be precluded from relying on this defense
considering that the Czech Republic “did not convict Fynerdale for any of the alleged wrongdoing

it now puts forward in its defence”, contrary to a Czech official currently charged with bribery.°"!

(ii) Loans 1-2 and 4-9

434. While the Respondent alleges that the Claimant only received funds from Appian Services
(Cyprus) Limited, the Claimant underscores that it received funds from a number of other entities,
such as Skoda Holding.*"? Far from being unsupported, as claimed by the Respondent, this is in
fact supported by the Expert Report, which confirmed that “Loan 4 originated from

the dividend payment from Skoda Holding S.A.”°'' and, which “identified legitimate sources of
funds following from Skoda Group dividends.”*'* Indeed, between April 2008 and July 2010,
Skoda Group paid out dividends to a company of the Appian Group, Appian Machinery,°' which
then transferred the sums to Fynerdale. Indeed, the Expert Report concludes that “a total
amount of CZK 14.044.000.000 was paid by Skoda Holding a.s. / Skoda Investment a.s. in the
period 2007-2011 to Appian Machinery Netherlands B.V. This total amount is sufficient to fund

the sum of the loans granted by Fynerdale to the poppy seed business.”°"

Further to the Hearing, the Claimant notes that:

Regarding Loan 4, it is not in dispute between the experts that this loan was funded by the
Skoda dividends and, thus, derived from the legitimate sources. Regarding Loans 6 and 7,
Mr. could trace back the funds to Chorus Investment Fund, which is part of the
Skoda structure. Regarding Loan 8, Mr confirmed that he could trace back the
funds to Appian Services (Cyprus) Limite Regarding Loan 9, Mr] could trace
the funds back to Appian Investment Group. Regarding both Loans 8 and 9, Mr|

states that there is circumstantial evidence on the record that their funding also originates
from the Skoda dividends.“!”

 

The Claimant further contends that, as shown by the i Statement, the Skoda group’s
funding and cash flow was unrelated to MUS." *At the Hearing, Mr further testified that,
following the freezing of the group’s accounts in view of the Swiss criminal proceedings, he had

ensured that any loans would only be funded from Skoda Group.°!”

438. The conclusions of the Respondent’s expert that she “cannot exclude” that the funds used for
other loans derived from the alleged MUS fraud “can obviously not lead to the conclusion that
the Czech Republic met any standard of proof in this respect.”° The | Expert
Report’s conclusions with regard to Loans 5 to 9 are unsubstantiated and solely based on

inferences.

439. In the Claimant’s view, if one were to follow this logic, “one could argue that the fact that it is
not in dispute between the Parties that Loan 4 and Loan 5 are funded legitimately entails that it
cannot be excluded that also the other Loans derive from legitimate sources.”°*

440. In view of the above, the Claimant submits that its investments were made in accordance with
Czech law and requests that the Tribunal accept jurisdiction over the present case. In any event,
referring to the case of OKO v. Estonia, the Claimant considers that “[t]he alleged illegality of

only a minor part of the investment does not render the whole investment illegal.”°”°

(iii) Available Documentary Evidence and the Respondent’s Request for Adverse Inferences

441. Prior to the Hearing, the Claimant indicated that it had been provided new documents that were
relevant to identify the source of funds for the loans. These documents were eventually provided
to the Claimant’s Expert, who was able to reach certain conclusions on these loans. In particular,
with regard to Loan 4, the Claimant contends that its Expert “was also able to trace back the funds
again to Chorus Investors Fund and, thus, close the chain of payments from Skoda Investments
up to Fynerdale. However, the admission of the relevant documents to prove this closure of the

chain of payments has been denied by the Tribunal.” 7

inferences based on an alleged refusal from the Claimant to comply with a part of the document

inferences — “that there is no satisfactory explanation for the failure to produce a document by the
concerned party” — is not met: the Claimant “provided a detailed explanation of the reasons why

not all documents can be produced.”°*

(iv) Conclusion

. In conclusion, the Claimant contends that the Respondent, which bears the burden of proof

regarding the alleged illegality, did not provide prima facie evidence with regard to the alleged
illegality of the investments of Fynerdale nor meet the applicable heightened standard of proof or
any other standard of proof. In any case, the Claimant contends that the Expert Opinion
proves that the vast majority of the loans were funded by the Skoda dividends, which were in no

way related to MUS.°”?

3. Qualification of the Loans as Investments under the BIT

. The Parties disagree as to whether the Loans granted by Fynerdale are of such a nature as to

qualify as investments under the Treaty.
a. The Respondent’s Position

Responding to a question from the Tribunal posed at the hearing, the Respondent notes that the
intent of the BIT is “to support the flow of investments that should, on its part, stimulate the
economic development of the contracting states or, in other words, contribute to their
economy.”®* The need for such contribution has been confirmed by the tribunal in Nova Scotia

Power Incorporated v. Venezuela, where the tribunal referred to the Salini criteria."

Although the Respondent concedes that the Salini criteria, set out by a tribunal acting under the
aegis of the ICSID Convention, may not be directly applicable to the present case, it points out
that “the Salini criteria may be helpful in determination of the contracting states’ intention when
concluding the present BIT.”**? The Respondent thus rejects the awards cited by the Claimant as

being “not instructive” and “unhelpful”.

While the Respondent does not deny that loans could be investments,” it considers that, in the

present case, the Loans do not represent protected investments under the Treaty because they
“were not made to the sovereign state or at least to a project benefitting the state”, but were
“simply loans to finance a private commercial transaction that was carefully designed to yield the

9» 635

maximum profit for a small group of private Czech individuals Moreover, the Respondent

notes that the Loans were made “with a very short duration and a very high interest.”°°°

The Respondent thus argues that “[t]he ordinary meaning of the term “economic value” suggests
that the contracting states intended to distinguish the protected investments from titles to money,
which have a mere financial value” and “shows the intent to protect such investments which
stimulate the economic development”.®”

In the Respondent’s view, the “Claimant is incorrect in suggesting that any transfer of money to
a private entity is a ‘self-explanatory’ contribution to the economy of the state in which the entity

is located.” °* According to the Respondent:

The opposite is true because one must analyze numerous elements of the transfer before
reaching a conclusion on whether and how the transfer impacted the state’s economy. The
timing of some of the transfers to the period of the global economic crisis is not relevant
because their basic attributes prevent their qualification as an economic contribution even
if at the time the Czech economy would be in dire need of liquidity.

  

The Respondent further considers that the investment in and of itself cannot be qualified as a
“foreign investment”: “[a]lthough the entities making the transfers were legally foreign, the
transferred funds were sourced in the economic activity of MUS or Skoda occurring in the Czech
Republic. Therefore, the loans cannot be considered a foreign contribution to the Czech economy

because the funds used were never actually foreign.”™”

As for the Claimant’s argument that its Loans participated to the Czech economy by providing

jobs to Czech farmers, the Respondent notes that this assertion is exclusively based on

Mr. as testimony, itself based on facts relayed to him by M: | — leading the

Respondent to conclude that “the story is most likely a fabrication.”"' In any event, even if this

 

story were to “hold water,” the Respondent considers that “the investments could not have saved

any of [the farmers] as the transactions with Czech farmers were fictional and never really

occurred.”

According to the Respondent, Loans 1, 2, 4 and 5, regarding which the underlying contractual
agreements were not produced in these proceeds, “must be carved out of the alleged investment”
because “Claimant’s approach to withhold the contractual agreements underlying some of its
alleged investment [...] would deprive Respondent of its most fundamental procedural right to be

heard."

Regarding Loans 4 and 5 in particular, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s constant
representation that these were issued to the Maltese company Poppyseed — and not the Czech
entity Ytrix — implies that those loans do not qualify as indirect investments. In particular, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant’s “volte-face” is late and is therefore inadmissible.“ In any
event, the Respondent argues that such argument is misguided: “[a] transfer of funds on its own
cannot qualify as an investment, since that is merely an implementation step, which does not say

anything about the underlying legal transaction — its contribution, duration or risk involved.”***

The Respondent notes that the underlying credit agreements indicated Poppyseed and Fynerdale
as Parties and did not involve Ytrix.“° Consequently, the risk undertaken by the Claimant was
that the Maltese entity would not reimburse the loan.*” In the absence of any credit agreements

supporting the factual allegations of the Claimant on the record, the Respondent asks that the

Tribunal make an adverse inference as to their content.

Loans 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the Respondent contends, do not qualify as investments considering their

characteristics: a very high interest rate, a very short duration, Mr. i s admission that

investment risk inherent in investment activity, but an ordinary commercial risk inherent in any

ordinary loan agreement.”°*!

The Respondent thus concludes that the Claimant’s Loans fail to qualify as an investment and
“invites the Tribunal to interpret the term [‘investment’] in line with the contracting states’
intention, i.e. requiring that an investment must contribute to the economic development of the

host state.”6?

b. — The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant notes that Article 1(a) is clear and “contains a broad definition of investment
comprising ‘every kind of asset’, specifically mentioning a title to money in the non-exclusive
list of what qualifies as an investment.”°*? The Claimant further notes another provision of the

Treaty to support its argument:

[Jn addition to Article 1 of the Treaty defining the notion of ‘investment’, Article 4 of the
Treaty provides that a contracting state should ensure that the payments related to an
investment are transferrable without any delay and undue restriction. The Treaty specifies
that such transfer includes interests and profits. Moreover, Article 4(c) explicitly states
that the payments relating to the investment include ‘funds in rep ayment of loans’.
Therefore, the express language of the Treaty proves the intention of the Contracting
States to cover loan agreements as protected investments.°**

The Claimant further argues that whether its investment contributed — or not — to the Czech
economy is irrelevant to its qualification as a protected investment under the Treaty because this
condition (i) is not present in the Treaty’s definition of an investment in Article 1(a)°* and (ii) is
borne by the Salini award issued by an ICSID tribunal and is thus an inadequate reference given

that the present case is brought under the UNCITRAL Rules.***

In any event, even if the Salini criteria were to be applied in this case, it is the Claimant’s case
that “the loans provided by Fynerdale comply with these criteria.”**’ Thus, the Claimant notes
that it has provided a capital contribution by investing over CZK 3 billion “in the form of purpose-
bound loans into the Czech Republic, which were intended to be used for the trade in poppy seed

produced in the Czech Republic.”*** The Claimant further considers that, as for the duration of its

investment, “each Loan should not be considered separately, but as a whole and that the
repayment period of each Loan is not a relevant issue under the Treaty in determining the duration
of the investment as a whole.”*? Regarding risk, the Claimant considers that it “took a substantial
risk that the principal amount of the Loans and the interest would not be repaid under the credit
agreements (which risk actually materialised).”°

In the event that the Tribunal were to consider that the criterion of contribution to the State’s

economy applied, the Claimant considers that it “is self-explanatory”:

Fynerdale has invested CZK 3,076,000,000 in total in the form of loans into the Czech

Republic in the period 2007-2011, i.e. including the years of the economic crisis in the

Czech Republic. [...] Fynerdale invested in the poppy seed market while farmers in the

Czech Republic had been facing difficulties to obtain funding from banks to finance their

business, which prevented them from becoming insolvent.
The Claimant, taking aim with the Respondent’s allegation that Loans 4 and 5 were provided
through Poppyseed, asserts that these were granted directly to Ytrix: “only Loans 3, 7 and 8 were
provided to Ytrix via Poppyseed” — leading to limit the Czech Republic’s jurisdictional objection

662

to these three loans. °° Contrary to the Respondent’s argument, the Claimant’s indication that

Loans 4 and 5 were provided to Ytrix is not belated.°®

Thus, the Claimant concludes that its loans qualify as an investment pursuant to Article 1(a) of

the Treaty.

4. Qualification of the Loans Made “Through” Poppyseed as a Protected Investment
Under the Treaty

Ownership and control by Fynerdale of Poppyseed is a matter of contention amongst the Parties,
who accordingly disagree on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae over the alleged

investment made “through” Poppyseed, pursuant to Articles 1(a) and 8 of the BIT.
Article 1(a) of the Treaty provides as follows:

the term ‘investments’ shall comprise every kind of asset invested either directly or
through an investor of a third State and more particularly, though not exclusively:

Article 8(1) and (2) of the Treaty provides as follows:

1) Alll disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be settled amicably.

2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in paragraph (1)
of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not been settled amicably within a
period of six months from the date either party to the dispute requested amicable
settlement.
As previously indicated, the loans made to Poppyseed were, according to the Parties’ initial
submissions, Loans 3, 4, 5, 7 and 8.°* At the hearing, the Claimant argued that both Loans 4 and 5
were in fact granted to Ytrix.%* The Respondent argues that it relied on the Claimant’s
presentation of the facts and that its belated “change of heart” ought to be declared inadmissible.°%
a. Whether Article I(a) Requires an Active Relationship between the Investor and the

Investment

(i) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that, in Article 1(a) of the Treaty, the verb “to invest” requires an active
involvement of the investor. This is firstly demonstrated by an analysis of the Treaty’s terms,
leading the Respondent to conclude that “the ordinary meaning of the verb ‘to invest’ in Article
l(a) indicates the necessity of an active role of the Claimant-investor in bringing about the
investment and an active relationship of the Claimant-investor with ‘its’ investment.” The

Respondent considers that this interpretation is supported by arbitral jurisprudence.°**

Article 1(a) provides for two alternative ways through which an investment can be made: either

directly, or through an investor of a third state.°” In any event, the Respondent argues

[t]he intermediation or interposition of the third party must be such as not affect the
character of the investment being made by the (Dutch) investor itself. Consequently,
although funds may pass foreign bank accounts on their way to the host state [...], the
investor must retain full control of the investment process. The Dutch investor must
always remain the de-facto investor.”

credited funds for investments in the Czech Republic.

In this case, “Claimant must demonstrate that it itself has invested this loan in the host state”.°”>

What Claimant chooses to disregard is that Claimant itself must have made the investment:
the present BIT says “through” an investor of a third state, not “by” an investor of a third
state, so that the subject of the investment needs to remain at all times the Claimant-
investor; the means or vehicle for making the investment may be a third-state entity.°”

 

It would be unreasonable to read the BIT as expanding this protection so that a Dutch bank
might grant loans to third entities around the world and that, where any such third entity
would invest the loaned funds in the Czech Republic, the Dutch-third country loan would
be elevated to a protected investment of the Dutch entity in the territory of the Czech
Republic.”

473. In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant fails to explain what the terms “through an investor of a

third state” in Article 1(a) of the Treaty could mean and fails to give any meaning to this phrase.**°

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

474. The Claimant alleges that it has “invested CZK 3,076,000,000 in the form of assets (loans) into

the Czech Republic, both directly to Ytrix and indirectly though Poppyseed”.*! The totality of
this investment is protected under the Treaty, as both direct and indirect investments are protected
under it. There is no requirement for an active relationship between an investor and its indirect

investment: that is an additional requirement imposed by the Respondent.***

475. The Claimant argues that the Respondent has taken a restrictive interpretation of the Treaty,

incompatible with its object and purpose.“ In the Claimant’s eyes, “the terms ‘to invest’ and
‘through the investor’ in Article 1(a) of the Treaty do not impose any additional requirements

upon the investor”.°*°

476. With reference to Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine and Saluka v. Czech Republic, the Claimant argues

687

that there is no support for a restrictive interpretation of the terms of the Treaty: indeed, “the term

‘to invest’ does not require that such asset must be ‘invested’ in the sense of an activity.” This

position was also followed by a number of other tribunals,”"* including the one ruling in Jnvesmart

v. Czech Republic, which was based on the same treaty as the one in the case at hand.**

The Claimant argues that to demand ownership or control by the investor of the entity through
which the investment is made (here, Poppyseed) is equivalent to adding a requirement to those
already contained in the Treaty.®’ How the investor chooses to channel its investment is irrelevant
to the protection of the Claimant under the Treaty.” The Tribunal should not deny jurisdiction
based on this criterion — quite on the contrary, “[i]Jn none of the cases [referred to by the

Respondent®””] did the tribunal formulate such strict criteria, i.e., that the entity must be a ‘mere

 

vehicle’ or that the investment must be made through the foreign company which the claimant-

investor wholly owned and fully controlled.”°

Indeed, when arguing that the third entity must only be a vehicle channelling the investment, the

Respondent only ever cites phrases that “describe the factual circumstances that led to the

tribunal’s that in that specific case and under those specific ci ” the

investment was protected.”°™*

However, even if the Tribunal were to implement the additional requirements set out by the
Respondent, the investments made by the Claimant “through” Poppyseed qualify as protected
investments under Article 1(a) of the Treaty. Indeed, the requirement for an “active contribution”

has in any event been complied with in the case at hand.

The Claimant thus argues that it “de facto controlled the investments made through Poppyseed as
it concluded credit agreements with Poppyseed in which the parties agreed that the credit should
exclusively be used for the making of investments in the Czech Republic towards the purchase of

poppy seed.”®° The Claimant thus relies on Article 2 of the credit agreements concluded between

Fynerdale and Poppyseed to argue that it was “crystal clear that Fynerdale did have influence on
when and how exactly Poppyseed would use the credited funds.”°°”

Such de facto control is evidenced by a number of documents produced in the course of these
proceedings. Thus, a number of documents support Mr. i : statement that he “was
entrusted to fulfil all investor’s instructions including the setting up [of] Poppyseed Limited”.“*
The fact that Fynerdale had the bank account statements of Poppyseed readily available is yet

another proof that Fynerdale de facto controlled Poppyseed.®”

Thus, the terms “through an investor of a third state” in Article 1(a) does not entail that the
700

Claimant should prove that it owns and/or controls Poppyseed.
Responding to the Tribunal’s question on whether a difference existed between the Sedelmayer
case and the one at hand, the Claimant argues that there is a factual difference between the two.
In Sedelmayer, the investor had “sought protection under the German-Russian BIT as a natural
person for the investments he had made through his wholly owned US company”.”"' In the present
case, the Claimant asserts that “Fynerdale, a legal entity incorporated in the Netherlands, and not
—as the Czech Republic now seemed to put forward during the Hearing — its Czech UBO’s, made
direct investments and indirect investments via the Maltese company Poppyseed in the Czech
Republic.””

b. Whether Article 8 Similarly Requires an Active Relationship between the Investor and the

Investment

(i) The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited only to those investments that

are “actively controlled by the investor [...] regardless of whether protection is granted to such
investments according to Article 1(a)”.7° Indeed, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction exists only with

regard to those disputes relating to investments “of” an investor — a term that implies that there

must be “a relationship of a certain quality between the investor and its investment.””* In

accordance with the ordinary meaning of the terms, as required by Article 31 VCLT, this article

must be read as requiring “an active and contributory relation, as opposed to a mere passive or

possessive relation.”””°

Relying on SCB v. Tanzania,” the Respondent argues that “[nJothing in the Netherlands-Czech
BIT suggests that the BIT would differentiate throughout these provisions as regards the meaning
it accords to the underlying investor-investment relation”””’ and that “[w]here the investor
channels its investment through a third-state entity, that entity would need to act under the control

of the alleged investor”.”* This analysis was reconfirmed by the tribunal in Garanti Koza LLP v.

Turkmenistan,” which applied the test developed by the tribunal in SCB v. Tanzania,’ and by

Blue Bank v. Venezuela, which considered that, for an investment to be “of” the Claimant, it ought

to be made by the defacto investor.”'' Thus, “it is crystal clear that the investor — the

o9 712

“entrepreneur’- needs to be in the driving seat of the investment activity’ The reasoning in SCB

v. Tanzania was further “followed or referred to” by other tribunals.”

In response to the Claimant’s explanation of the test in SCB v. Tanzania in its first Post-Hearing
Brief, the Respondent argues that “the word ‘or’ at the end of the sentence was not used as an
alternative conjunction but as a cumulative conjunction because the sentence was construed as

negative. Therefore, Claimant must demonstrate all these requirements in order to establish active

relationship with the investment.””"4

In conclusion, the Respondent argues that the “Claimant needs to show that it (and not the Maltese
company Poppyseed) actively made the investment in the Czech Republic. Importantly, the

Claimant investor must show that Poppyseed acted under its control and that it (the Claimant

investor) retained control of the investment process.” 7° Otherwise, the Tribunal has no

jurisdiction ratione materiae.

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

488. The Claimant considers that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae over the present
claims, as Article 8(2) contains a broad definition of “investment” and does not require any
“active and contributory relation.” Indeed, the arbitration agreement only contains four criteria:
(i) the existence of a dispute between (ii) a State and (iii) an investor, (iv) relating to an investment

of the latter.

489. The Claimant argues that the Respondent’s position that an “active and contributory relation” on
the basis of the award in SCB v. Tanzania is ill-guided. Indeed, it is the first tribunal to consider
such a requirement — and the only one.”'® The Respondent has not provided any response to this
representation.”!” Moreover, the Claimant underscores that the tribunal had found, in that case,
“that the claimant must demonstrate one of the following criteria: (i) that the investment was made
at the claimant’s directions; (ii) that the claimant funded the investment; or (iii) that the claimant

controlled the investment in an active and direct manner.””'*

490. The Claimant also considers that SCB v. Tanzania should be distinguished from the case at hand,
given that the underlying treaty in that case referred to investments “made”, not “invested”, in the
host State.”? The investment made by Fynerdale through Poppyseed should be regarded as
protected under the Treaty as Fynerdale provided loans directly to Poppyseed without any other

intermediate companies,” as shown in the below graphic representation:””!

ec. Interpretation in the Light of the Object and Purpose of the Treaty

(i) The Respondent’s Position

493. The Respondent, for its part, considers that its interpretation of Articles 1(a), 8(1) and 8(2) of the
Treaty is confirmed by the object and purpose of the Treaty.

494. First, the principle of reciprocity enshrined in the BIT does not encompass the protection, under
a Dutch BIT, of investments made by a company of a third State — even if said company
“effectively uses funds which it has prior acquired from a Dutch creditor”.”° Indeed, according
to the Respondent, it would be unreasonable to consider that loans granted by Dutch banks would
be protected if the loaned funds were used for an investment in the Czech Republic.”*' Moreover,
“it is much more plausible that the Czech Republic agreed to arbitrate with Dutch entities that had
actually made investments in the Czech Republic (directly or indirectly).””*

495. Second, the Treaty’s preamble is “premised on a cause-and-effect relation between the treaty
protection offered and the investment decision made.””* As such, Fynerdale must have actively

made the investment in the Czech Republic for it to be protected.”

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

496. The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s analysis, considering that the object and purpose
of the Treaty do not support the interpretation suggested by the Respondent. Indeed, “neither
Article 1(a) of the Treaty sets additional requirements to the terms ‘to invest’ and ‘through the
investor’ nor does Article 8(2) of the Treaty contain an additional ‘active relation’

requirement.” The Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione materiae as the Treaty expressly provides

protection to indirect investments made “through a third state”.”>°

d. Evidence of Ownership in, and Control over, Poppyseed

(i) The Respondent’s Position

. The Respondent considers the Claimant’s account of its alleged ownership of Poppyseed to be

“strikingly vague and incoherent””*”

and that “Poppyseed was not owned (wholly or even in part)
by the Dutch Claimant-company Fynerdale (which for itself would suffice to exclude the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction). [...] Poppyseed was not controlled — neither generally nor specifically
with regard to the loaned funds -, by the Dutch Claimant-company Fynerdale.””*

The Respondent contends that, during document production, the Claimant was unable to provide
any document indicating that it exercised control over Poppyseed, as it alleged,” notwithstanding
the fact that this was expressly requested in the Respondent’s Document Request no. 9.” In
breach of the Tribunal’s order, the Respondent argues, the Claimant has further failed to produce

any document relating to the communication between the Claimant and Poppyseed.”!

According to the Respondent, the evidence put forth by the Claimant in support of the proposition
that it had control over Poppyseed — Mr Ds statement — points in the opposite direction:

 

the planned division of Poppyseed’s shares between Newton and Fynerdale never occurred.”

Only once, in 2015, i.e. after the investment was made, did Fynerdale give instructions to
Poppyseed.”** This limited example shows that, in fact, during the entire period of the investment

(2007-2010), Fynerdale did not control Poppyseed. The Respondent further notes that Mr.

| admitted that “he did not communicate with Mr. | [Fynerdale’s director

at the time of the alleged investment] during the relevant period and as such could not have

received any instructions from the only authorized representative of Claimant.””*

As such, the Respondent considers that “[t]here is, conversely, no indication whatsoever that

Poppyseed would have been acting under the control of the Dutch Claimant-company

99745

Fynerdale.”’* In fact, Fynerdale’s role was simply that of a bank: it concluded a number of credit

agreements with Poppyseed, had no control over the loaned funds, nor any contractual right to

direct how those funds should be used.™° As such, “Fynerdale simply extended regular loans to
the Maltese company Poppyseed, based on a standard loan agreement.””*’ When Poppyseed chose
to invest funds in a certain manner, this was done independently of Fynerdale.”*

The Claimant’s argument that its control is proven by the fact that it directed Poppyseed to use
the funds loaned to the purchase of poppy seed through the credit agreements, according to the
Respondent, is “absurd”.”” The Respondent considers that the particular clause inserted in the
contract that stipulates the purpose for which the loan is requested is not equivalent to a direction
being given by the lender,” but rather, it is a means to entitle the lender to retrieve the funds if
they are used for another purpose.’*' In effect, that clause “does not suffice to establish de facto
control.””*?

The Respondent thus concludes in its Post-Hearing Brief that “[c]ontrol via mere contractual
default, however, is no control at all. If Claimant were right, each person would be under full
control of any and all entities to which she owes contractual obligations, such as banks, phone
operators, landlords, tenants, heat providers ete.”73

Similarly, the fact that the Claimant attempts to rely on the judgment of the Prague Municipal
Court, the Respondent argues, merely shows the lack of evidence supporting the Claimant’s
argument that it controlled or owned Poppyseed.”**

755

Nor was Poppyseed owned by Fynerdale, whether directly or indirectly.’ The Respondent

contends that the Claimant has even admitted as much, when it explained during the document
production phase that it “does not argue that it was a shar eholder of Poppyseed”*° —

had been agreed that Fynerdale was to acquire shares in Poppyseed.”” At this stage, “[m]ost of
the ownership structure in Poppyseed is [...] left in the dark.””**

In the Respondent’s view, the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that Fynerdale was anything
more than a conduit, a “pass-through of funds on their way from the Netherlands to the Czech
Republic”.”*° In fact, the Claimant’s failure to provide the bank statements requested during the
Document Production phase leads to “serious concerns as to whether there had indeed been a
“channeling of funds’ ‘through’ Poppyseed”. The Respondent thus concludes that “[t]he Claimant
company was not the only source of funds for Poppyseed some funds may have vanished in
Poppyseed and not ‘passed on’ to the Czech Republic and, importantly, at times funds were
granted to Ytrix which had not been prior received from Fynerdale”.”

This was further confirmed by Mr. is testimony at the Hearing that “[t]he business was
carried out by Poppyseed”.”*! Mr. , | further testified at the Hearing that Fynerdale was

chosen as the “funding entity”, one amongst multiple choices.””

Lastly, the Respondent addresses the Claimant’s reliance on the allegation that its UBOs
controlled Poppyseed. Following the document production phase and Claimant’s response to the
document request no. 10, it appears that “neither Mr i nor Mr Hi have instructed
Poppyseed or Poppyseed’s Czech shareholders with regard to the operation of Poppyseed.””* In

any event, the Respondent argues that whether or not Fynerdale’s UBOs controlled Poppyseed
via Fynerdale is irrelevant: firstly, because in any event, they did not do so through Fynerdale;”™*
secondly, because if they directly control Poppyseed, then the investments made through

765

Poppyseed are not made for an investor under the Treaty.’ Indeed, Fynerdale is not to be

confused with or regarded as equivalent to its UBOs.”

representatives.” This shows that “Messrs and i were setting up the investment

structure on their own behalf (not on behalf of the Dutch entity)”.”** Mr. s confusion

of Fynerdale with its UBOs is irrelevant from a legal standpoint.’ Relying on elements that came
to light after the Hearing, the Respondent further notes that, in the course of the Czech criminal
proceedings, both Me and wa | “explicitly denied that they would be associated with

Claimant.”"”

509. Therefore, and in conclusion, the Respondent considers that “Poppyseed was certainly not
Fynerdale’s investment vehicle and Fynerdale certainly did not qualify as the ‘de-facto investor’
with regard to the funds which were ultimately transferred from Poppyseed to the Czech Republic.
Claimant’s extension of loans to the Maltese company Poppyseed, therefore, constitutes no
investment ‘of? Claimant in the Czech Republic ‘through Poppyseed’ (or otherwise).”””! The
Claimant, in the Respondent’s view, was “a mere postbox company without independent will”
that “failed to establish an active relationship with the investment and cannot qualify as an indirect

. »m
investor.”

(ii) The Claimant’s Position

510. Inthe Claimant’s view,

It follows from the SCB v. Tanzania case that in order to benefit from Article 8(1) of the
investment treaty of the investment treaty, a claimant must demonstrate one of the
following criteria:

i. that the investment was made at the claimant’s direction;
ii. that the claimant funded the investment; or
iii. that the claimant controlled the investment in an active and direct manner.”

511. The Claimant, for its part, points out that the Loans granted by Fynerdale had to be used
exclusively for the purchase of poppy seed: any other purchase would require written approval
from Fynerdale.”” In fact, Fynerdale has been recognized as an injured party in legal proceedings

in the Czech Republic, in which it sought damages in relation to the Ponzi scheme set up by the

Poppy Seed Merchants for those funds invested in the Czech Republic by Poppyseed.’”* This is
proof enough to show recognition of Fynerdale’s investment “through” Poppyseed and how it

endured damages because of Poppyseed’s losses.

The Claimant takes issue with the Respondent’s qualification of Fynerdale as a “bank”. Fynerdale
merely realized an indirect investment through Poppyseed, and such investments are protected by
the Treaty.’” In the Claimant’s view, it suffices to say that “there is a nexus between incoming
funds from Fynerdale and outgoing payments to the Czech entities [and that] Poppyseed was also

dependent on such funds to start and continue to maintain its poppy seed business.””””

Established as an investment vehicle for Fynerdale, Poppyseed was de facto controlled by
Fynerdale, which funded all of Poppyseed’s investments and directed them.’ The Claimant
argues that this is evident from the Statement and the directions Fynerdale gave to
Poppyseed to its shareholders for the daily operation of that company.’” At all times,
vr had to report to Mr. and “was entrusted to execute all instructions of the

investor Fynerdale”.”*°

In light of all the above, the Claimant considers that it is evident that Fynerdale de facto controlled

Poppyseed.

Before entering into a review on its jurisdiction, the Tribunal must deal with the Parties’ defenses

but by the UBOs of the latter, including Mr. i and Mr. | | both being of Czech
nationality. In this context, the Tribunal notes that Mr. i was Fynerdale’s representative

when entering into the trade of poppy seed. Mr. ia: role was confirmed by the witness
statement of Mr. | In this context, the Tribunal will also deal with the Respondent’s
argument that the funds used by the Claimant had originated in the Czech Republic and thus could

not be qualified as foreign investment,”*' an argument which the Claimant considers to be belated.

The Tribunal notes that Article 1(b) of the Treaty defines the term “investors” either as “natural
persons” having the nationality of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its law or as
legal persons constituted under the law of one of the Contracting Parties. It is undisputed that
Fynerdale is a legal entity incorporated in in the Netherlands and therefore meets the formal
qualification under Article 1(b) of the Agreement. That Mr. when acting as Fynerdale’s

representative, is of Czech nationality does not put into doubt the nationality of Fynerdale.

The Tribunal will now turn to the assertion of the Respondent that the funds used by Fynerdale
originated in the Czech Republic and thus were not foreign investments. It is undisputed that the
funds were received by Fynerdale, an entity incorporated in the Netherlands, and then transferred,
in a form still to be discussed, into the Czech Republic. This meets, in the view of the Tribunal,
the formal requirements of the Treaty for an investment. Under these circumstances, the Tribunal
considers it unnecessary to deal with the argument of the Claimant that the respective objections

of the Respondent were belated.

As indicated above, the Claimant contends that the 2016 Czech Decision, submitted into evidence
by the Respondent, proves that the alleged crimes regarding the MUS purchase involved
wrongdoings of representatives of the Czech Government while arguing that the Respondent
ought to be precluded from relying on this defence considering that the Czech Republic “did not
convict Fynerdale for any of the alleged wrongdoing it now puts forward in its defence”, contrary
to a Czech official currently charged with bribery.”
be belated.

The Respondent considers such argument to

The Tribunal has already indicated that it is necessary to distinguish between facts and

conclusions drawn from such facts.”*’ The facts to which the Claimant refers were known.

Apart from that, the Tribunal does not consider this argument raised by the Claimant in its Second
Post-Hearing Brief to be convincing. It would mean that a State whose representatives were

involved in fraud or corruption could not invoke fraud or corruption against the validity of the

ensuing State action, such as a contract or a license. This would be to the detriment of all attempts
to eradicate fraud or corruption. The Claimant’s argument is moreover not supported by Mabco
v. Kosovo. 4 In the case at hand, the Czech Republic acted against the alleged fraud once it
became aware of the alleged fraud in respect of the MUS transactions whereas, in the case Mabco

v. Kosovo, Kosovo was aware of the illegality and undertook no action.

Equally the discontinuation of the local Czech proceedings against the Claimant’s UBOs”® are

not new facts; they are open for interpretation by the Tribunal.

Taking account of these considerations the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to further consider

whether the objection of the Claimant was belated.

b. Jurisdiction of the Tribunal ratione materiae

The Tribunal will now consider its jurisdiction ratione materiae in light of the views expressed

by the Parties.

Under the heading as to whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the dispute ratione

materiae, the Parties have argued several issues that are controversial between them.

The Tribunal will turn to each in the following sequence. First, it will ascertain as to whether the
disagreement among the Parties about the existence of investments may be decided in the
jurisdictional phase of the proceedings or whether should be decided in the merits phase, as the
Claimant argued in its Post-Hearing Brief.’*° Second, the Tribunal will consider the arguments
exchanged by the Parties as to whether the loans may constitute investments. Third, the Tribunal
will consider the arguments the Parties concerning the legality of the investments. This point will
embrace two issues namely whether the question concerning legality may be decided in the
jurisdictional phase or should be reserved to the merits phase and whether the loans were legal

under the law of the Respondent.
ec. Existence of an Investment as a Jurisdictional Issue

The Tribunal notes that, as a matter of principle, investor-State arbitral tribunals are mandated to
hear only disputes relating to investments within the meaning of the concerned BIT. From that, it

has been deduced in literature as well as in jurisprudence, that such tribunals only have

529.

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award
29 April 2021

jurisdiction to hear disputes relating to an investment. However, the Tribunal notes that neither
the jurisprudence, nor the academic writings are uniform on what this means procedurally.
Investment arbitral tribunals disagree as to whether the existence of an investment can be decided
in proceedings on jurisdiction, or whether such decision is to be left to the merits phase. For
example, in the dispute Salini v. Morocco™’, the tribunal stated that “...its jurisdiction depends
upon the existence of an investment within the meaning of the Bilateral Treaty as well as that of
the Convention...” More recently, the tribunal in Alps Finance v. Slovak Repub lic followed the
same approach concluding that it lacked jurisdiction because the claimant had not made an
investment. ’** Conversely, in Oostergetel v. Slovak Republic , the tribunal confirmed that an
investment had been made and held that “[w]hile the extent and effect of Claimant’s activities
will have to be examined in further detail at the merits stage, at this juncture the Tribunal is
satisfied that the Claimants have made a contribution to the Slovak Republic’s development as
mandated by the Salini test.”

The Tribunal is aware that the Salini test is being discussed controversially in the jurisprudence
as well as in literature. In particular, Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration proclaimed

the Salini test to be outdated. They stated:

The modern approach — based on the concept of separability, which has now received

i d both nationally and internationally - is that an ion of
illegality does not in itself deprive the arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction. On the contrary, it
is generally held that the arbitral tribunal is entitled to hear the arguments and receive
evidence, and to determine for itself the question of illegality. Thus, in Switzerland in a
case involving a consultancy agreement, the Swiss Federal Tribunal decided that even if
a consultancy agreement were, in effect an agreement to pay a bribe (and this was not
alleged, still less proven) the arbitration agreement would survive.”

The Tribunal takes the view that, as to whether the legality of investments is to be decided in the
phase on jurisdiction or in the one on the merits should be determined on the basis of the
applicable law. The Tribunal would like to emphasize that the jurisdiction of international
investment tribunals reflects the consent of States on which disputes may be submitted to
international arbitral tribunals. The jurisdiction of national courts has a different basis and
therefore the reference to the practice of national courts is not necessarily conducive in this

context.

As indicated in paragraph 526, the Tribunal will now deal with the question as to whether object
and purpose of the Treaty require of the Tribunal to ascertain in the phase on jurisdiction that

loans may constitute investments within the meaning of Article 8 of the Treaty.
The here relevant Article 8, paragraphs | and 2 of the Treaty reads:

(1) All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible, be
settled amicably.

(2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in
paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not
been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either
party to the dispute requested amicable settlement.

It is the clear meaning of Article 8 of the Treaty that the mandate of the arbitral tribunal is limited
to disputes concerning investments as referred to in Article 8 and as defined in Article 1 of the
Treaty, and that this describes the scope of the Tribunals’ jurisdiction. There is no disagreement

amongst the Parties on this fundamental issue.

Whether this means that the question of legality of investments has to be decided in jurisdictional

or in the merits phase is an issue still to be approached by the Tribunal in subsection (d) below.

As indicated above the Tribunal will now consider the arguments of the Parties whether loans
constitute investments. This has to be dealt with on two levels namely as to whether loans may

qualify as investments in general and whether they qualified as such in the case at hand.

d. Loans as Investments

The Tribunal notes that it has occasionally been discussed controversially whether loans qualify

as investment.

In the view of the Tribunal, this depends upon the definition of the notion of ‘investment’ as
provided in the BIT concerned. The here relevant agreement provides in Article 1 of the Treaty
for a wide, but not exhaustive, list of activities which qualify as potential investments. The
Tribunal would like to emphasize that, before providing the non-exhaustive list if types of assets,
Article 1 (a) of the Treaty first notes that the term investment comprises of “every kind of asset”.
There can thus be little doubt that the Contracting Parties to the Treaty had intended the definition
of the notion of investment to be a broad one. If there were meant to be limits to such broad

definition, they should have been set out in Article 1 of the Treaty. Therefore, the Tribunal has

537.

538.

539.

540.

541.

PCA Case No. 2018-18
Award
29 April 2021

no doubt that the loans made by the Claimant may, at least in principle, qualify as investments

under Article | of the Treaty.

On that basis and referring to the objective of the Treaty, the Respondent argues that for a loan to
qualify as investment, such a loan should stimulate the economic development of the contracting
States or contribute to their economy. In this respect, the Respondent quotes particularly the award

in the case Nova Scotia v. Venezuela:

The Tribunal considers that an investment can be said to be present when a contribution has
been made for a sufficient duration with the hope of receiving a benefit (including the
inherent risk that one will not result). Or, to put it into more traditional terms, an investment
requires contribution, duration and risk. These well-established features have been
recognized by many an investment arbitration tribunal as the triad representing the minimum
requirement s for an investment.”
The Claimant’s main argument is that, given that these conditions were originally developed in
the Salini award in interpreting Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, they are of no significance
for Article 1(a) of the Treaty and hence cannot be used as a reference to the present case brought
under UNCITRAL Rules.” To support this argument, the Claimant refers to paragraph 211 of

Saluka v. Czech Republic.”*

This exchange of arguments between the Parties requires the Tribunal to briefly deal with the so-
called Salini test already referred to. The arbitral tribunal in Salini v. Morocco held that the notion
of investment presupposes a certain contribution to the host State’s economy, a certain duration
over which the project is implemented, an element of risk, and, a contribution to the host State’s
development; being understood that these elements may be closely interrelated and should be

examined in their totality, and will normally depend upon the circumstances of each case.”*

The Tribunal has already noted that this test has come under scrutiny in subsequent ICSID

jurisprudence. For example, in Biwater v. Tanzania, the tribunal noted that “there is no basis for

a role of overly strict application of the five Salini criteria in every case.””°

Taking into consideration that this Tribunal is working under the UNCITRAL Rules, whereas the
‘Salini test’ has been developed under the ICSID regime, the Tribunal does not consider it

necessary to deal with the arguments exchanged between the Parties as to whether this test is

appropriate, directly or in a modified format, for deciding this dispute. Instead, the Tribunal will
develop its views on what constitutes an investment on the basis of the Treaty having recourse to
the Treaty interpreted according to Article 31(1) and (2) VCLT. The standard format of
interpretation is relying on the “ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in the light
of its object and purpose”. Paragraph 2 of Article 31 provides some guidance as far as object and
purpose are concerned. Most relevant in the context here is the preamble of the Treaty to be
interpreted. The Tribunal notes that references to the preamble of an international agreement are
common standard when interpreting such agreement. The Preamble of the here relevant Treaty
establishes clearly which purposes the Treaty intends to achieve, namely the intensification of the
“economic relations between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech Republic”. The
Preamble further adds: “Recognising that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such
investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology as economic development of the
Contracting Parties”.””°

Therefore, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimant’s reasoning that the contribution to the
economic development of the host country is of no relevance for the qualification as to whether a
transfer of funds as an investment. Contrary to the approach advocated by the Claimant, Article
1 of the Treaty has to be read in connection with the Preamble of the Treaty. This means,
according to Article 1(a) of the Treaty (“every kind of asset invested either directly or through an
investor of a third State”), it is the purpose of an investment to serve the economy of the Czech

Republic.

On the other hand, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent that the investments undertaken
were “simply loans to finance a private commercial transaction that was carefully designed to

the Claimant was meant to have an impact upon the economy of the Czech Republic, if one does

not consider the individual loans individually, but the program in its entirety.

Therefore, the Tribunal holds that the loans, as planned by the Claimant, were meant to serve the

agricultural economy of the Czech Republic and thus qualify as investments under the Treaty.

However, the Tribunal wants to emphasize that Loans 1, 2, 4 and 5 were paid back in full already
(see paragraph 92 above). These loans may have constituted investments at the moment of their
payment, but since they have been paid back, the Claimant cannot have experienced any injury
in their respect. Accordingly, the Tribunal will not consider these loans any further nor any lack

of documentary evidence pertaining to them.
e. Legality of an Investment as a Jurisdictional Issue

The Tribunal will now proceed to assess whether Loans 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9 are legal investments.
However, before doing so the Tribunal has to establish first whether the question of the legality
of the investments can be dealt with as a jurisdictional issue or whether such question belongs to

the merits phase.

It is controversially discussed in international jurisprudence on investments whether only legal
investments under the laws of the host State qualify as investments under an investment
agreement and thus constitute the basis for the jurisdiction of the respective Tribunal. In Phoenix
v. Czech Rep ublic, the arbitral tribunal denied jurisdiction on the basis that there was no legal
investment.*” It stated: “[t]here is no doubt that the requirement of the conformity with the law
is important in respect of the access of the substantive provisions on the protection of the investor
under the BIT. This access can be denied through a decision on the merits. However, if it is
manifest that the investment has been performed in violation of the law, it is in line with judicial
economy not to assert jurisdiction.”**' However, the jurisprudence is not uniform. In Plama v.

Bulgaria, the legality of the investment was decided at the merits phase.*””

At this point, a clarifying word upon the meaning and scope of the notion of jurisdiction is called
for.*°? According to Professor Reinisch, jurisdiction is an attribute of a tribunal and an objection
to jurisdiction goes to the ability of a tribunal to hear a case.‘ Whether an international court or
tribunal has jurisdiction is a central question in international adjudication. Whereas under national
law, governed by the rule of law, a dispute between private persons or a private person and the
State can be decided by a national judicial body, the situation is different for international
adjudication. In international law, access to an international adjudicative system depends upon
the consent of the parties to the dispute concerned. The Permanent Court of International Justice,
followed by its successor the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has strictly upheld this
requirement of consent to their jurisdiction.*** This will guide the following considerations of the
Tribunal. To put it concretely it is now for the Tribunal to ascertain whether the consent of the
Parties also covered disputes concerning investments, which were illegal or violating international

public policy.

The Tribunal notes that several cases referred to by the Claimant have been decided under the
ICSID regime. Some have decided on the question of legality of the investment in the merits
phase others on the phase of jurisdiction. The reasoning in the respect varied. Some have argued
that there is an implicit legality requirement under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention while
others invoked general principles of international law and public policy.*’’ An example to this
extent is World Duty Free v. Kenya. *” The Tribunal stated the objective of its considerations as

follows:

129. The Tribunal will consider first whether a bribe has been paid by ...to... in the present
case, and whether the 1989 Agreement has been procured as a result of such a payment.
If so, the Tribunal will have to examine the consequences of the bribe on the enforceability
and the validity of the Agreement, both under ordre public international and the applicable
laws, 8°

After a lengthy assessment of the then existing jurisprudence the arbitral tribunal came to the

conclusion that:

In light of domestic laws and international conventions relating to corruption, and in light
of the decisions taken in this matter by courts and arbitral tribunals, this Tribunal is
convinced that bribery is contrary to the international public policy of most, if not all,

States or, to use another formula, to transnational public policy. Thus, claims based on
contracts of corruption or on contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by this
Arbitral Tribunal. °°

On this basis, the tribunal denied jurisdiction. The Tribunal takes note of this award, although

having been decided under the ICSID rules, since the factual situation has some similarities with

the one under consideration here.

Based upon what has been established in paragraph 548 above, it is the view of the Tribunal that
whether an issue is to be considered in the phase on jurisdiction or under the one on the merits
cannot be decided on an abstract level balancing certain considerations such as jurisprudential
efficiency and the protection of the rights of the parties to the dispute but that the wording of the
relevant BIT has to be determinative. It is the BIT, which reflects the consent of the Parties on
what is the mandate of the tribunal concerned or formulated in concrete terms which investment
disputes can be accepted by the relevant arbitral tribunal and which have to be dismissed without

entering into the merits phase.

The wording of the various BITs differs in respect of whether the legality of the investments is

referred to. Article 2 of the Treaty which is relevant in respect of the case at hand states:

Each Contracting Party shall in its territory promote investments of the other Contracting
Party and shall admit such investments in accordance with its provisions of law.

In the view of the Tribunal, this clearly establishes that the conformity of investments with the
national law of the host State of the investment is part of the notion of investment. Accordingly,
the jurisdiction of this Tribunal only covers disputes concerning legal investments. Article 2 of
the Treaty cannot be ignored or set aside by having recourse to the traditionally perception on

what is to be dealt within the merits phase and what under jurisdiction. *'°

World Duty Free v. Kenya, para. 157.
Exhibit RLA-142, Fraport v. Philippines (11), comes to the same conclusion although not being able to rely
on an equivalent to Article 2 of the Treaty. It ruled: “The Tribunal finds that Fraport violated the ADL when
making its Initial Investment, the latter being consequently excluded as investment protected by the BIT
because of its illegality. The illegality of the investment at the time it is made goes to the root of the host
State’s offer of arbitration under the treaty. As it has been held, ‘States cannot be deemed to offer access to
the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments made in violation of their own law.’ Lack of

555. It is the considered view of the Tribunal that dealing with the legality of the loans under
jurisdiction does not curtail the procedural rights of the parties to the dispute. At least that is not
the case at hand. Both Parties had agreed that the Tribunal should deal with its jurisdiction in a
separate procedure and they both have argued the nature of the loans as well as their legality
profoundly. Both Parties made efforts to produce the necessary documents to enlighten the
Tribunal concerning the object of such loans as well as concerning their legality. Nothing would
be gained to repeat this process again in a merits phase. Therefore, considerations of judicial
efficiency also call for a decision on the legality of the loans at the present phase — the phase on
jurisdiction. However, the Tribunal would like to point out that it considers Article 2 of the Treaty
as the dominant argument in favour of dealing with the legality of the loans in the phase on

jurisdiction.

556. Since both parties have presented to the Tribunal facts, which were controversial it was evident

that the Tribunal had to have recourse to the standard of proof.

(i) Loan3

557. It is for the above reasons that the Tribunal will ascertain the legality of Loan 3 in the context of
the decision on jurisdiction. The Respondent argues that the money for Loan 3 was derived from
the so-called MUS Fraud. Concerning the latter, the Respondent relied on the 2017 Swiss
Supreme Court Judgment, by which Fynerdale’s UBO were convicted for money laundering and
fraud.*'' As mentioned above, it was concluded in separate investigations by the Czech authorities

that the “flow of funds from the MUS fraud to Claimant was not established”, leading to the

812

discontinuation of the Czech proceedings.*'~ The Respondent underscores that this decision,

which was reached without some of the evidence submitted in those proceedings and placed

before this Tribunal, is not equivalent to an acquittal.*"?

jurisdiction is founded in this case on the absence of consent to arbitration by the State for failure to satisfy
an essential condition of its offer of this method of dispute settlement. The Tribunal therefore considers that
there is no legal dispute arising out of, or a divergence concerning, an ‘investment’ and, moreover, that
Respondent has not consented to the arbitration of Claimant’s claims with respect to its investment.
Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that it lacks jurisdiction over Claimant’s claims pursuant Article 25(1) of
the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the BIT. It also follows that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over
Respondent’s counterclaims in view of their necessary connection with the subject matter of the dispute
pursuant to Article 46 of the ICSID Convention.”

The counter-argument of the Claimant is that the findings of the Swiss Federal Supreme Court
were “highly controversial” and due to political pressure.*'* The Claimant criticizes the 2017
Swiss Supreme Court Judgment in general terms and states that the judgment cannot be used as
evidence that the funding of Loan 3 derived from MUS transactions. The Claimant further alleges
that “the Czech authorities have investigated for several years whether the funds obtained in
relation to the acquisition of MUS could have been the source of funding for the trade in poppy
seed and explicitly concluded that there was no wrongdoing”.*!°

These general arguments are, in the view of the Tribunal, not sufficient to rebut the assessment
of the Respondent that Loan 3 was illegal. The Claimant further argues that the illegal origin of
the funds was never proven. This view of the Claimant, however, has become irrelevant due to
subsequent developments. On the basis of the YY Expert Report,*!® the Claimant
concedes that part of Loan 3 had been funded by MUS funds, namely CZK 330 million out of
CZK 667.5 million.*'” The Tribunal further notes that, contrary to what the Claimant alleges, the
Czech authorities have not ruled that there was wrongdoing on its part, but have rather concluded
that, based on the evidence provided to them (which is not the same evidence that has been placed

before this Tribunal), it was not possible for them to press criminal charges.

On the basis of this information and on the Claimant’s concession regarding Loan 3, the Tribunal
does not consider it necessary to deal with the question whether it had been sufficiently proven
that Loan 3 was based on funds derived from a fraudulent activity. At this point, it is equally
unnecessary to address the question of which party had the burden of proof, and what level of

proof was required in respect of the transaction concerning Loan 3.

In view of the Tribunal, the fact that nearly 50 per cent of Loan 3 was generated by a fraudulent
activity renders this loan contrary to international public policy and illegal under the national law

of the Czech Republic, and thus, not falling within the protection of the Treaty.

(ii) Loans 6, 7, 8 and 9

. In consequence of the decision that the Tribunal will ascertain the legality of the loans in the

jurisdictional phase, it will now turn to loans 6, 7, 8 and 9.

It is not contested by the Parties that Loans 6, 7, 8 and 9 were transferred through the company
Appian Service (Cyprus Ltd.).

The sources of these four loans were discussed by the two experts. Ms stated in her
summary that she was unable to identify the ultimate source of funds used to provide the loans 5
to 9. She further stated that “... funds originating from a bank account belonging to Mostra
Investment Limited provided the monies for Loan 6 to 8” and Mostra Investment Limited, “which
was connected to MUS fraud and used as a conduit for Loan 3 transaction, have also been utilized
in providing monies to Fynerdale for Loans 6 to 8.”*'* In section 2.11 of her report, she
summarized: “[g]iven that the ultimate source of funds has not been identified, I cannot exclude
the possibility that the funds used for loans 5 to 9 derived from the fraud perpetrated against MUS,
particularly, given that, in my opinion, funds used for Loans 3 have derived from MUS fraud.”*!
ue stated in response to Ms s findings that he did not “find [...] any factual
evidence that substantiates the possibility that the funds for loan 6 derive from the alleged MUS

fraud.”*”° An identical statement was made concerning Loans 7, 8 and 9.*!

The Tribunal sees the factual situation concerning the sources of Loans 6 to 9 as follows: whereas
va does not exclude that the funds for the four loans were derived fully or in part
from the MUS fraud, Mr. —on the basis of an improved document situation, thanks to the
submission of new documents by Mr. between March and June 2020 — cannot identify
any factual evidence that substantiates the findings of Ms. YY In the view of the
Tribunal, these two expert opinions do not fully match due to the different objectives both
pursued. At the end, they both do not achieve a result on which the Tribunal may base its decision.
Whereas Ms assumes that the investments may have been derived from fraudulent
monies — which does not mean that they have, - Mr. iz states that there was no factual
evidence to that extent — which does not mean that there might not exist such evidence-.

Accordingly, the Tribunal is bound to resort to the rules concerning the burden of proof in

international adjudication. The question concerning the burden of proof as well as the standard of

proof to be applied has been discussed by the Parties intensively.

As a matter of principle, it is generally accepted that the party alleging relevant facts bears the
burden of proof. Reference may be made in this respect to Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.
This principle is also reflected in the rules of other international adjudicative bodies. This
principle has not been disputed by either Party; they disagree, however, as to whether in the case

at hand a reversal of the burden of proof is called for.

The Claimant asserts that the full burden of proving the alleged illegality rests with the
Respondent. The Respondent disagrees, arguing that, due to the particularity of this case, it is
sufficient that it provides prima facie evidence for the illegality of the investments undertaken by

the Claimant, and it is for the latter to prove that the investment was legal.

The Respondent invokes basically two reasons which, in its view, justify shifting the burden of
proof, namely that (i) this case is one where there is a near impossibility to prove illegal acts like

corruption or money laundering,*” and that (ii) the Tribunal has the right to shift the burden of

3
proof.*?3

The Claimant takes the opposite position, relying on the basic rule that the party alleging
relevant facts has the burden of proof. Both Parties support their positions by referring to decisions
of international arbitral tribunals disagreeing on whether the factual particularities of each case
make it appropriate or rather inappropriate to refer to this case as a precedent. A perusal of the
existing jurisprudence clearly indicates that a shift of the burden of proof depends upon the
particularity of each case and that the tribunal in question has a certain discretion in assessing the

relevant facts.** This discretionary power the Tribunal will use.

As indicated above, the Respondent was not able to prove that Loans 6 to 9 were made by using
monies generated by fraudulent activities, and it does not claim it did. The Respondent
consistently emphasized that it only was able to raise red flags.*> The Tribunal will now
reconsider the expert opinions, on the basis of what has been stated in respect of the burden of

proof.

(d) Loan 9: vei referring to the missing documentation between the various stages
of the flow of funds, stated that he “was not able to confirm the funding of Investhold
Ltd. and as a consequence, was not able to confirm that loan 9 was funded by Skoda

The Tribunal interprets these findings in the sense that, in respect of Loans 6 to 9, it has not been
established with certainty that these were funded from the dividend paid by Skoda Investment a.s.
This uncertainty concerning the origin of the funds for the Loans 6 to 9 is due to the incomplete

documentation and the complexity of the system for the channelling the funds.

It is the view of the Tribunal that it was in the responsibility of the Claimant to establish the source
of the funds in the first place. The burden of proving that Loans 6 to 9 were funded from the

dividend paid by Skoda Investment a.s., or other legal sources, was thus on the Claimant. Only

after these facts are established would it have fallen upon the Respondent to prove that the origin
of the funds was different and came from fraudulent sources. The Claimant has not provided such

proof to the satisfaction of the Tribunal.

In this context, the Tribunal takes note of the elements raised by the Respondent as red flags,
casting doubt on the legality of the funds used to finance the investments, including its reference
to the conclusions of the 2017 Swiss Supreme Court Judgment. Following the Respondent’s
arguments based on alleged red flags, the Claimant would have been expected to convince the
Tribunal of its good standing. However, the Claimant did not provide supplementary evidence to

support its statements and further substantiate its expert’s conclusions.

Considering the doubts due to the paucity of evidence provided by the Claimant, the Tribunal
concludes that there is insufficient evidence for it to presume the legality of the origin of the funds
for the loans. In consequence thereof, these loans cannot be qualified as investments protected

under the Treaty in accordance with its Article 2.

In light of the above, the Tribunal denies jurisdiction on the basis that the origin and the legality
of the investment has not been established. The Tribunal accordingly considers it unnecessary to
entertain the arguments exchanged between the Parties as to whether the Claimant was in control

of the investments allegedly made in the Czech Republic.

DISPOSITIF

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal,

1. Unanimously, rejects the Respondent’s objection that that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
over the present dispute on the basis that the arbitration agreement contained in Treaty
is incompatible with European law and thus invalid;

2. By majority, finds that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the present dispute
on the basis that the legality of the investment is not established;

3. Unanimously, reserves its decision on costs for an award on costs, to be issued after the
receipt of costs submissions from the Parties.
