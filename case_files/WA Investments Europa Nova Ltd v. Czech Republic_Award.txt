INTRODUCTION

THE PARTIES

The Claimant in the present arbitration is WA Investments-Europa Nova Limited (“WA
Investments”, “WAIEN”, or the “Claimant”), a company incorporated under the laws of
Cyprus, with its registered address in Diomidous Street, 10, Alphamega-Akropolis Building, 3%
floor, Flat/Office 401, 2024 Nicosia, Cyprus. The Claimant is represented in the proceedings by
Prof. Luca G. Radicati di Brozolo, Avv. Michele Sabatini, Mr. Emilio Bettoni, and Mr. Flavio
Ponzano of ARBLIT- Radicati di Brozolo Sabatini Benedettelli, Via Alberto da Giussano, 15,
20145 Milan, Italy.

The Respondent is the Government of the Czech Republic, a sovereign State (the “Government”,
or the “Respondent”, and together with the Claimant, the “Parties”). The Respondent is
represented in these proceedings by Mr. Paolo Di Rosa of Arnold & Porter LLP, 601
Massachusetts Avenue NQ, Washington, D.C. 20001-3743, United States; Mr. Dimitri Evseev
of Arnold & Porter LLP, Tower 42, 25 Old Broad Street, London EC2N 1HQ, United Kingdom;
Ms. Karolina Horakova and Libor Moravek of Skils s.r.o. advokatni kancelar, Kfizovnické nam.
193/2 110 00 Prague 1, Czech Republic; and by Ms. Marie TalaSova, Ministry of Finance of the
Czech Republic.

BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE,

The proceedings arise out of an investment made by the Claimant in the photovoltaic sector in
the Czech Republic. A dispute has arisen between WAIEN and the Government in respect of the
alleged cancellation of the legal, tax, and regulatory incentive regime that had previously been

established by the Czech Government in the photovoltaic sector.

The Claimant has commenced arbitration pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of
the Cyprus Republic and the Government of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic for the
Promotion and Protection of Investments of 15 June 2001 (the “BIT”), and the Energy Charter
Treaty of 16 April 1998 (the “ECT”).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIATION OF THE ARBITRATIONS
On 8 May 2013, the Claimant, together with nine other investors, jointly filed a single Notice of

Arbitration for a multi-party arbitration.

The Claimant designated Prof. Luca Radicati di Brozolo and Mr. Michele Sabatini of Bonelli

Erede Pappalardo Studio Legale (Milan) as its lead counsel. While these attorneys left Bonelli

PCA Case No. 2014-19

Award

Page 15 of 204

Erede Pappalardo Studio Legale and established ARBLIT in October 2013, they have been

serving as counsel for the Claimant throughout the proceedings.

The Respondent initially designated Professor Zachary Douglas (Matrix Chambers), Mr. David
W. Alexander (Squire Sanders (US) LLP, Columbus), Mr. Stephen P. Anway (Squire Sanders
(US) LLP, New York) and Ms. Karolina Horaékova (Weil, Gotshal & Manges LLP, Prague) as
its counsel. At a later stage of the proceedings, Professor Zachary Douglas withdrew from the
representation, and Mr. David W. Alexander and Mr. Stephen P. Anway were replaced by
Mr. Paolo Di Rosa (Arnold & Porter LLP, Washington DC) and Mr. Dimitri Evseev (Arnold &
Porter (UK) LLP, London) (see paragraphs 59 and 61). Ms. Horakova’s law firm changed its

business name to Skils s.r.o. advokatni kancelaf.

On 10 June 2013, the Respondent replied to the Claimant, noting that they understood the Notice
of Arbitration to be an invitation to consent to the consolidation of the claims. The Respondent
proceeded to split the proceedings into six different arbitrations, and appointed Judge Peter
Tomka, Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC, and Mr. Toby Landau QC as its party-nominated

arbitrators.

On 24 June 2013, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent stating that this was a multi-party

arbitration and not a case of consolidation.

On 27 June 2013, the Respondent wrote to the Claimant, challenging this classification, stating
that there is “no single arbitration agreement in existence that is capable of extending to all the

different claims based upon different treaty obligations in different international instruments.”

On 5 July 2013, the Claimant requested the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of
Arbitration (the “PCA” or “Registry”) to designate an appointing authority (“AA”) pursuant to
Article 6(2) of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules as
revised in 2010, to complete the constitution of a single arbitral tribunal and to proceed to take a

decision on the competence of the tribunal, in light of the lack of agreement between the Parties.

On 9 July 2013, by a letter to the PCA Secretary-General, the Respondent challenged the
Claimant’s request to designate an AA, alleging that in the present case, no power had been
conferred on the Secretary-General under the Rules to make arbitral appointments. The
Respondent further argued that the Notice of Arbitration was invalid, because it invoked the 2010
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules instead of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The
Respondent stressed that “there is no single arbitration agreement in existence that could possibly
give a single arbitral tribunal authority over all the 10 claimants, their alleged investments, and

their claims under the distinct international instruments.”

Award

Page 16 of 204

By the Respondent’s letter of 9 July 2013 and the Claimant’s letter of 22 July 2013, the Parties

agreed that the present arbitration shall be governed by the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law of 1976 (the “UNCITRAL Rules”).

On 13 August 2013, the Secretary-General declined to act upon the Claimant’s request, owing to
the lack of a basis under the UNCITRAL Rules justifying the Secretary-General’s intervention.
This was because first, appointing authorities had been agreed in advance in some of the
instruments invoked by the Claimant, and secondly, because the Respondent had actively
participated in the proceedings and responded to the Notice of Arbitration in a timely manner by

appointing the second arbitrator.

CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

On 8 May 2013, the Claimant appointed Mr. Raymond Doak Bishop as the first arbitrator.
On 10 June 2013, the Respondent appointed Mr. Toby Landau QC as the second arbitrator.

On 17 March 2014, the co-arbitrators appointed Professor Hans van Houtte as the President of

the Tribunal, thereby duly constituting the Tribunal.

On 1 August 2014, having learned that his firm had been recently engaged in other matters that
potentially involved issues similar to those in this arbitration, and citing grounds of a perception

of bias, Mr. Doak Bishop tendered his resignation from the Tribunal.

On 5 August 2014, the Claimant was requested to appoint a new arbitrator to replace Mr. Bishop
as a Tribunal member, pursuant to Articles 7(1) and 13(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal

the ings until the i of a new c

On 24 September 2014, the Claimant appointed Mr. Gary Born as its party-nominated arbitrator.

COMMENCEMENT OF THE PROCEEDINGS AND PLACE OF ARBITRATION

On 22 April 2014, the Claimant submitted its individual Notice of Arbitration to the Respondent.
This date is deemed as the formal date for the commencement of the present proceedings pursuant
to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant proposed
Geneva, Switzerland as the legal seat of the present arbitration, but indicated that it would also
accept Paris, France as the legal seat of arbitration in the event that the Tribunal selected a seat

of arbitration within the European Union.

On 23 May 2014, the Respondent submitted a Response to Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration
by which it raised its objections to jurisdiction, and set out its version of the factual background

to the dispute. In addition, the Respondent proposed Paris, France as the legal seat of the present

arbitration.

On 15 July 2014, by Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal established that the place of

arbitration would be Paris, France.

On 20 October 2014, the Claimant submitted its Motion to Transfer the Seat of Arbitration,
from Paris to Geneva, citing the request of the European Commission for leave to intervene, as
well as actions taken by it and EU courts in other unrelated arbitrations as presenting grounds for

transferring the seat of arbitration to a non-EU country.

On 12 November 2014, the Respondent submitted its objections to the Claimant’s Motion to

Transfer the Seat of Arbitration, raising the absence of reasons compelling a change of the seat.

On 27 February 2015, in its Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal ordered that the place of

arbitration shall be Geneva, Switzerland.

EUROPEAN COMMISSION INTERVENTION, AND CONFIDENTIALITY

On 11 July 2014, the European Commission (the “EC”) submitted an Application for Leave to

Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party.

On 15 July 2014, in its Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal, with the agreement of the Parties,
appointed the Permanent Court of Arbitration as the administering authority in the proceedings.

By the same order, the Tribunal set out the procedural timetable applicable to the proceedings.
Procedural Order No. 1 ined the following provision on conf

“Either Party may publicly disclose submissions made in these proceedings unless there
has been a decision by the Tribunal to the contrary. Requests for confidential treatment
of any item communicated in these proceedings may be submitted by either Party to the
Tribunal for a decision, in which case no item which is the subject of such request may
be publicly disclosed unless and until the Tribunal has decided upon such application.”

On 17 July 2014, the Claimant submitted its comments on Procedural Order No. 1, including an
objection to the confidentiality provisions, on the grounds that “the issue of confidentiality ha[d]
not been discussed or agreed upon by the Parties”, nor had there been any agreement on the
applicability of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency in Treaty-Based Investor-State
Arbitrations. The Claimant also raised the point regarding the choice of seat of arbitration in a
European country, highlighting that the Respondent had waived the “Intra-European Union BIT
objection”, and stating that the Commission’s objection on this ground raised “serious doubts as

to the transparency of the Respondent’s behaviour.”

On 30 July 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to address by 8 August 2014 the Claimant’s

letter of 17 July 2014, asking it to “specifically elaborate[e] on the possible inconsistency with
confidentiality obligations in related matters and on its possible public law obligations of
transparency that may be applicable.” The Tribunal also invited the Claimant to submit its
response, by 18 August 2014, to the Respondent’s submission and to the Respondent’s letter of
29 July 2014. The Tribunal stressed that confidentiality should be maintained until the Tribunal

decided on the matter.

On 8 August 2014, the Respondent stated that due to the suspension of proceedings by virtue of
Mr. Doak Bishop’s resignation from the Tribunal, it would submit its response to the Claimant’s

letter of 17 July 2014, as soon as the proceedings were reinstituted.

On 11 August 2014, the President of the Tribunal advised that the Respondent’s response should

be submitted within one week of the appointment of the new arbitrator.

On 26 September 2014, following the appointment of Mr. Gary Born as the Claimant-appointed
arbitrator, the Tribunal notified the Parties of the resumption of proceedings, and set the new date

for submissions on the request from the EC for Leave to Intervene as 3 October 2014.

On 3 October 2014, the Respondent provided its response to the Claimant’s letter of 17 July
2014.

On 7 October 2014, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit its comments on the EC’s
Application for Leave to Intervene by 20 October 2014. The Tribunal also ordered that the
“Simultaneous Cross-Requests for Production of Documents”, which were originally due by 20

August 2014, would now be due by 27 October 2014.
On 20 October 2014, the Claimant submitted its Comments on the EC's Intervention.

By Procedural Order No. 2, dated 27 February 2015, and pursuant to Article 15(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal (with a Concurring Opinion from Mr. Gary Born) granted the
EC leave to intervene as amicus curiae, subject to the condition that the Commission undertake,
prior to consideration of its submissions, to pay in full the reasonable costs of all Parties resulting

from the submissions.

On 6 March 2015, the Registry communicated Mr. Gary Born’s Concurring Opinion to the
Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2. Mr. Gary Born expressed serious reservations, stating that it
is “exceedingly difficult [...] fairly to conclude that the Tribunal has the authority, over one
party’s objections, to permit a non-party to participate in the arbitral process.” However, he added
that bearing in mind the interest of consistency and predictability in arbitral decisions, he was

persuaded to grant the EC leave to intervene, subject to appropriate conditions.

On 8 April 2015, the EC submitted a Written Amicus Curiae Submission.

On 8 April 2015, the EC also submitted an application to vary Procedural Order No. 2, to

reconsider the condition concerning the undertakings on costs.

On 9 April 2015, the Tribunal dismissed the EC’s application to vary Procedural Order No. 2.
The Commission was granted a further opportunity to make the required undertaking on costs by
Wednesday, 15 April 2015, and notified that, if the required undertaking was not provided by

that date, the EC’s amicus curiae submission would be disallowed.

On 14 April 2015, the EC stated that it was not in a position to provide the undertaking as required

by the Tribunal. Accordingly, its amicus curiae submissions were disallowed.

DISCLOSURE BETWEEN TRIBUNALS

On 8 December 2014, the Tribunal enquired whether the Parties would be willing to accept that
the Tribunal should be informed of rulings made in the parallel proceedings involving the
Respondent (PCA Case Nos. 2013-35 and 2014-1), on issues which also arise in one or more of

the four proceedings before the Tribunal.

On 10 December 2014, the Respondent responded to the Tribunal’s enquiry, stating that, subject
to appropriate undertakings from the Tribunal, it would be prepared to agree to the Tribunal’s

suggestion.

On 12 December 2014, the Claimant expressed its agreement that the Tribunal may have access
to the decisions in the parallel proceedings. The Claimant added that a simple agreement of the

Parties was sufficient in the circumstances, and that no further agreements were required.

On 17 December 2014, the Respondent proposed that the Parties in the present proceedings, as
well as the nine other claimants in the parallel cases, sign a written agreement “regulating the
process of disclosure of the Rulings and the scope of waiver of confidentiality in the other

proceedings”.
On 27 December 2014, the Claimant sent a draft proposal for a Disclosure Agreement in the
parallel proceedings, to the Respondent.

On 6 January 2015, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant’s proposal.

On 15 January 2015, the Respondent notified the Tribunal of the Parties’ agreed procedures for
disclosure regarding the Rulings in PCA Cases Nos. 2013-35, 2014-1, 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-

21 and 2014-22, contained in the Disclosure Agreement.

On 27 March 2015, the Parties jointly proposed an amended procedural calendar to the Tribunal,

which was approved by the Tribunal on 30 March 2015.

DOCUMENT PRODUCTION REQUESTS
On 5 May 2015, the Claimant submitted its Request for Document Production, and related
documents. It additionally addressed earlier requests for documents that had been opposed by the

Respondent, and asked the Tribunal to decide on the Claimant’s requests.

On the same date, the Resp i its ication R ding Document P1

On 19 May 2015, by Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal issued rulings with respect to each
contested document request. The Tribunal reserved the right to review and change any of its
decisions concerning the Parties’ present requests at a later stage of the proceedings, if it

considered that the documents concerned were relevant and material to its determinations.

On 12 June 2015, the Parties agreed to a revision of the procedural calendar, and submitted it to

the Tribunal.

On 29 June 2015, the Claimant submitted its Memorial (including Response on Jurisdiction)

(the “Memorial”) and accompanying documents.’

By e-mail dated 1 July 2015, the Respondent gave notice that Professor Zachary Douglas had

withdrawn as counsel from the proceedings.

On 17 July 2015, the Respondent submitted its Application for Leave to Make Further Targeted

Requests for Production of Documents (“Respondent’s Targeted Request”).

On 14 October 2015, pursuant to the procedural calendar, the Respondent submitted its Counter-

Memorial and accompanying documents.”

On 15 October 2015, the President acknowledged receipt of the Respondent’s submission, and
made a disclosure relating to Ms. Bridey McAsey, a member of the Respondent's counsel team.
The President suggested the removal of Ms. McAsey from the Respondent’s legal team in order

to confirm the independence of the Tribunal.

On 16 October 2015, Counsel for the Respondent confirmed that Ms. McAsey had been removed

from the Respondent’s legal team for the present proceedings.
On 2 November 2015, the Parties communicated a revised procedural calendar to the Tribunal.

On 25 November 2015, the Claimant submitted its further document requests in the form of a
completed Redfern Schedule, and sought a decision from the Tribunal on the disputed requests

raised by the Respondent’s objections of 4 November 2015.

On 2 December 2015, the Claimant submitted an “unsolicited submission”, in order to draw the
Tribunal’s attention to Price Decision No. 5/2015 of the Czech Energy Regulatory Authority,

stating that this decision “has direct and fundamental consequences for the cases before this

 

Arbitral Tribunal in terms of cause of action, jurisdiction, damages and relief sought”.

Accordingly, the Claimant sought an extension to the dates for filing of submissions.

On 3 December 2015, by Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal issued its decision on the
Claimant’s further targeted requests for the production of documents. The Tribunal set out its

tulings with respect to each contested request in the “Tribunal’s Comments” column of the

Redfern Schedule, attached as Annex I to Procedural Order No. 4.

On 8 December 2015, the Respondent challenged the Claimant’s submission of 2 December
2015, alleging that the submission was “calculated to prejudice the Tribunal against Respondent’s

position on document disclosure issues”.

On 9 December 2015, the Respondent submitted documents pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4.
It also asked the Tribunal to confirm the Claimant’s obligations to maintain the confidentiality of

the documents and “not disclose them publicly or to parties in other proceedings.”

On 10 December 2015, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Parties’ agreements to vary
the existing procedural calendar which would inevitably affect the agreed hearing date, and

requested the Tribunal to indicate its availability for new hearing dates.

On the same date, the Claimant i its with the Respondent that

received in the course of the parallel arbitrations were strictly confidential and must not be
publicly disclosed, but made the point that “both Parties must be in the position to use specific
documents obtained in these arbitration proceedings also in the parallel cases, if they are relevant

and material to the outcome of those cases.”

On 15 December 2015, the Tribunal stressed that documents submitted in the present
proceedings:
“cannot be disclosed publicly and can neither be referred to and/or be submitted in
proceedings other than the [present] four arbitration proceedings [...] unless such
reference and/or submission is authorized by the proper authorities in those other

proceedings, by the law or by common agreement of the Parties involved in those other
proceedings.”

On 17 December 2015, the Tribunal set the new dates for the hearing as 26 February 2017 to 5

March 2017.

By separate e-mails dated 6 March 2017, pursuant to the Tribunal’s authorization at the hearing,*
the Respondent submitted two further exhibits into the factual record of the present proceedings
as R-427 and R-428.

By e-mails dated 7 June 2017, the Parties requested “a one-week extension of time to provide

submissions on costs”. The President granted the extension by e-mail of the same date.

On 16 June 2017, the Claimant submitted the Claimant’s Submission on Costs (the “Claimant’s
Submission on Costs”) to the Registry. On the same date, the Respondent filed its Cost
Submission (the “Respondent’s Cost Submission”) with the Registry. On 17 June 2017, by
agreement of the Parties, the Registry circulated the Parties’ respective cost submissions to the

other side and to the Tribunal.

By e-mail of 9 November 2017, the Respondent inquired whether the Tribunal had already
completed its deliberations on the key issues before it, indicating that it might apply for the
introduction of recent arbitral awards on subjects related to those currently pending before this

Tribunal.

On 14 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had “reached an advanced stage
in its deliberations on key issues [...] and therefore considers that there is no need for a

supplemental briefing.”

By e-mail dated 5 December 2017, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confirm “whether exhibit

Tribunal.

By separate e-mails of 15 December 2017, each Party confirmed that exhibit C-26 is a verbatim

reproduction of the Act on Promotion as published in the Czech Official State Journal.

By letter dated 13 March 2018, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to admit into the record
of the present arbitration, and invite comments on, the judgment of the Grand Chamber of the
Court of Justice of the European Union in the matter of Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV dated 6
March 2018 (the “Achmea judgment”).

Upon the Tribunal’s invitation, by letter dated 23 March 2018, the Claimant provided its

comments, opposing the Respondent’s aforementioned requests.

Following a further round of comments received from the Respondent on 6 April 2018 and from
the Claimant on 13 April 2018, the Tribunal decided on 18 April 2018 to grant the Respondent’s
requests and invite further submissions from the Parties on the impact of the Achmea judgment
on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In particular, the Tribunal invited submissions from the Parties on

the following issues:

1. Whether the Achmea judgment is dependent on the specific wording of the BIT that
was at issue in the case before the ECJ and how it relates to the BITs at issue in the
present proceedings;

2. Whether and how the Achmea judgment applies in arbitrations where the arbitral
seat is outside of the EU, including in particular the impact, if any, of Article 344
TFEU on the validity of an intra-EU BIT jurisdiction clause for an arbitral tribunal
sitting outside of the EU;

3. Whether and how the Achmea judgment applies to the Energy Charter Treaty;

4. Whether and how the Achmea judgment actually impacts upon the jurisdiction of an
arbitral tribunal sitting outside of the EU, as distinct from the enforceability of
awards within the EU;

5. How the Achmea judgment fits in, if at all, with Articles 59 and 30 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties;

6. The relevance of Articles 27 and 46 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
for the present arbitrations;

7. How Swiss courts and Swis

 

scholarship have considered the position of EU law in
a legal universe consisting of international law and domestic law;

8. The impact, if any, of Article 177(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private
International Law; and

9. The role of waiver / estoppel, including in light of Article 186(2) of the Swiss Federal
Code on Private International Law, in this context.”

2018, 10 May 2018, and 8 June 2018, all of which were granted by the Tribunal, on 14 May 2018

and 9 June 2018 respectively, each Party submitted its comments on the impact of the Achmea
judgment on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction (the “Respondent’s Comments on Achmea” and

“Claimant’s Comments on Achmea”), accompanied by legal authorities.'°
105. By letter to the Parties dated 24 June 2018, Mr. Born stated as follows:

Iam writing to inform you that, due to recent, unforeseen developments in another
proceeding, I have concluded that it is prudent for me to resign as co-arbitrator in the
captioned matters. Regrettably, obligations of confidentiality prevent me from providing
further details.

106. By letter dated 25 June 2018, the PCA, under instructions of the Presiding Arbitrator, invited the
Parties to provide their comments on Mr. Born’s letter of 24 June 2018, “tak[ing] into account
Swiss law as the law of the seat of the arbitration, with reference to the treatiese of Bernhard
Berger & Franz Kellerhals, International and Domestic Arbitration in Switzerland, 3 edition
2015, pp. 331-335.

107. On 9 July 2018, each Party provided its comments on Mr. Born’s letter.

108. By letter of 11 July 2018, the Presiding Arbitrator and Mr. Landau sent a letter to the Parties,
stating as follows:
Given the advanced stage that these proceedings have already reached, the Parties are
invited to provide, by Wednesday, 18 July 2018, their comments on the possibility that
the Presiding Arbitrator and Mr. Landau complete these arbitrations as a two-person
tribunal, assuming that they are able to agree on all matters in dispute, it being understood

that, failing agreement on any matter in dispute, the Presiding Arbitrator and Mr. Landau
would invite the Claimants to make a substitute appointment.

109. On 18 July 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it wished to proceed with the

appointment of a substitute arbitrator.

110. By letter dated 20 August 2018, pursuant to Articles 13(1) and 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules,
the Claimant appointed Mr. John Beechey, CBE as its party-appointed arbitrator.

By letter of 28 August 2018, the Respondent expressed concerns pertaining to Mr. Beechey’s

appointment and requested Mr. Beechey’s resignation in the present matter.

By e-mail dated 3 September 2018, Mr. Beechey advised the Parties that he would “leave it to

the appointing authority to consider the matter on its merits.”

On 4 September 2018, the Respondent submitted its Notice of Challenge of Mr. Beechey in
accordance with Articles 11(1) and 11(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

By e-mail dated 19 September 2018, the Claimant advised the Tribunal that it did not agree to
the challenge of Mr. Beechey, and that the Parties had agreed that the challenge be decided by

the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

On 26 October 2018, the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce dismissed

the challenge to Mr. Beechey.

By letter dated 8 November 2018, the Claimant inter alia requested the Tribunal “to inform the

submissions. On the same date, the Tribunal provided an update on the status of its deliberations

to the Parties.

On 16 November 2018 the Respondent requested the Tribunal “to allow the Parties to provide
supplementary briefing on recently issued and highly relevant arbitral awards”, to schedule a
“brief oral hearing, to permit counsel to address issues arising out of the Achmea Judgment”, and

commented on the Claimant’s request for updated costs submissions.

By letter of 19 November 2018, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s request for a briefing on
recently issued awards, citing the advanced stage of its deliberations. By the same letter, the
Tribunal granted leave to the Respondent to submit a “short written submission on any genuinely
new points regarding the Achmea Judgment that it considers it has not had an opportunity to
address”. The Claimant was afforded an opportunity to submit a “brief written reply” thereto.
The Tribunal further invited the Parties to provide a comprehensive update of their position on
costs. Finally, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, upon receipt of the aforementioned
submissions, it intended to declare the hearings closed in accordance with Article 29(1) of the

UNCITRAL Rules.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

THE INTRODUCTION OF THE INCENTIVE REGIME FOR RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES
(“RES REGIME”)

In 1992, the Czech Republic adopted Act No. 586/1992 on Income Tax (“Act on Income Tax”),
which, according to the Claimant, was the first legislative step encouraging the use of renewable
energy sources (“RES”), including photovoltaic plants. Through the Act on Income Tax, the
Czech Republic implemented two relevant tax incentives. The first exempted RES producers
from corporate income tax for the year in which the respective solar facility was put into operation
and the following five calendar years (“Tax Holiday”).'° The second incentive introduced an
accelerated depreciation period for tax purposes for certain components of, inter alia,

photovoltaic installations. '7

In December 1995, the EC (then called “the Commission of the European Communities”)
published a white paper on the “Energy Policy for the European Union”, which aimed at
encouraging the promotion of RES through tax benefits and other measures.'* In November 1997,
the EC published another white paper entitled “Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of
Energy” stating that “[a] long-term stable framework for the development of renewable sources
of energy, covering political, legislative, administrative, economic and marketing aspects is in

fact the top priority for the economic operators involved in their development.”

On 27 September 2001, following the publication of the two white papers, the European
Parliament and the Council of the European Union adopted Directive 2001/77/EC on the
promotion of electricity produced by RES in the internal electricity market (“2001 Directive”),
aiming “to promote an increase in the contribution of [RES] to electricity production in the
internal market for electricity and to create a basis for a future Community framework thereof.””?
In light of this objective, EU Member States were required to “take appropriate steps to encourage

greater consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in conformity with

Article 19(1)(d), Act No. 586/192 (Ex. C-18/R-1). The English translations of the original sources in

Czech submitted by the Parties differ. Where they differ, the Tribunal quoted from the English translation
that is the most clear and comprehensive.

[...] national indicative targets”*' and to “adopt and publish a report setting national indicative
targets for future consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in terms of
percentage of electricity consumption for the next ten years.””* The 2001 Directive also obliged
Member States to “outline the measures taken or planned, at the national level, to achieve these
national indicative targets” and to publish their success in meeting the targets.’ The Annex to
the 2001 Directive set out “[r]eference values for Member States’ national indicative targets for
the contribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources to gross electricity

consumption by 2010.”4

In late 2003, the Czech Republic prepared draft legislation that was aimed at increasing the
support provided to RES producers.”> An explanatory report on the draft legislation was dated 12
November 2003 (“Explanatory Report”).”°
March 2005 as Act No. 180/2005 Coll. (“Act on Promotion”). While not yet an EU Member

State, the Czech Republic was already under an obligation to comply with EU law, including

The draft legislation was eventually adopted in

tules on State aid. On 16 December 2003, the Czech Society for Wind Energy and the Czech
national section of the European Association for Renewable Energy (“EUROSOLAR”) filed a
complaint with the EC in respect of the 2003 draft of the Act on Promotion in view of its alleged

incompatibility with EU State aid law.?”

On 27 July 2004, having examined the complaint, the EC informed EUROSOLAR that the 2003
draft of the Act on Promotion, as it then was, “does not fall under the definition of State aid within
the meaning of Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty”.”* The last paragraph of the letter read: “Should
you learn of any new particulars that might demonstrate the existence of an infringement of the

State aid rules, I would be grateful if you would inform my department as soon as possible”.”°

deriving from EU legal instruments, including the 2001 Directive. In particular, Annex II —
Energy, Part A of the 2003 EU Accession Treaty set the Czech Republic’s national target for the
contribution of electricity produced from RES to the gross electricity consumption by 2010 at
8% (“Indicative 2010 Target”).°

On 31 March 2005, the Czech Republic adopted the Act on Promotion, which entered into force

on | August 2005.7! Section 1(2) of the Act on Promotion defined its objectives as follows:

Section 1
Subject Matter of Regulation

(2) The aim of this Act is to, in the interest of climate protection and environmental
protection,

a) promote the exploitation of renewable energy sources (“Renewable Sources”),

b) ensure that the share of Renewable Sources in the consumption of primary energy
sources continually increases,
contribute to conservation in the exploitation of natural resources and to the
sustainable development of society,
put in place the conditions for achieving the indicative target so that the share of
electricity produced from Renewable Sources accounts for 8% of gross electricity
consumption in the Czech Republic in 2010 and to put in place the conditions for
further increasing such share after 2010.

d@

The Act on Promotion introduced new incentives for RES producers through a combination of
tariff and non-tariff i including: (1) p i of RES prod in the
distribution or transmission of electricity, (2) fixed purchase prices or Feed-in-Tariffs (“FiT”)
and, alternatively, (3) Green Bonuses (“Green Bonuses”, and together with the FiT, “Subsidies”

or “Tariffs”).*?

 

The preferential treatment of RES producers in the distribution or transmission of electricity

  

enshrined in Section 4 of the Act on Promotion, provided, inter alia, for the obligation of the
transmission grid operator and distribution system operators “to connect the facilities [...] to the

ion or

 

transmission grid or distribution systems on a priority basis for the purpose of transmi!

distribution of electricity from [RES]”, if a RES producer requests them to do so.*?

The FiT system obliged grid operators to purchase all electricity produced from RES on a priority

basis and at a price annually determined by the Czech Energy Regulatory Office (“ERO”).**

141.

Section 6
Amounts of Prices for Electricity from Renewable Sources and
Amounts of Green Bonuses

(1) The Office sets, one calendar year in advance, the purchasing prices for electricity from
Renewable Sources (the “Purchasing Prices”), separately for individual kinds of Renewable
Sources, and sets green bonuses, so that

a) the conditions are created for the achievement of the indicative target so that the share
of electricity produced from Renewable Sources accounts for 8% of gross electricity
consumption in 2010 and

b) for facilities commissioned

1. after the effective date of this Act, there is attained, with the Support consisting of
the Purchasing Prices, a fifteen year payback period on capital expenditures,
provided technical and economic parameters are met, such parameters consisting of,
in particular, cost per unit of installed capacity, exploitation efficiency of the
primary energy content in the Renewable Source, and the period of use of the
facility, such parameters being stipulated in an implementing legal regulation,

2. after the effective date of this Act, the amount of revenues per unit of electricity
from Renewable Sources, assuming Support in the form of Purchasing Prices, is
maintained as the minimum [amount of revenues], for a period of 15 years from the
commissioning year of the facility, taking into account the industrial producer price
index; the commissioning of a facility is also deemed to include cases involving the
completion of a rebuild of the technological part of existing equipment, a change of
fuel, or the completion of modernization that raises the technical and ecological
standard of an existing facility,

3. prior to the effective date of this Act, there is maintained for a period of 15 years the
minimum amount of Purchasing Prices set for the year 2005 in accordance with the
legal regulations to date and taking into account the industrial producer price index.

(2) When setting the amounts of green bonuses, the Office also takes into account a heightened

degree of risk associated with off-taking electricity from Renewable Sources in the

electricity market.

When setting Purchasing Prices and green bonuses, the Office proceeds on the basis of

differing costs for the acquisition, connection and operation of individual types of facilities,

including the development thereof [the development of such costs] over time.

Purchasing Prices set by the Office for the following calendar year shall not be less than

95% of the Purchasing Prices in effect in the year for which the setting decision is made.

The provision of the first sentence shall not be used for setting the Purchasing Prices for the

following calendar year for those types of Renewable Sources where the payback period on

capital expenditures is shorter than 11 years in the calendar year in which the Office decides
on the setting of the new Purchase Prices; When setting Purchase Prices, the Office

proceeds in accordance with subsections 1 through 3.

Thus, pursuant to Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion, RES producers were projected to
recover their investment in RES plants within 15 years, provided that the installations met certain
“technical and economic parameters”, including “cost per unit of installed capacity, exploitation
efficiency of the primary energy content in the Renewable Source, and the period of use of the
facility.” Article 6 of the Act on Promotion also introduced two restrictions on the ability of the

ERO to change the tariffs. First, Article 6(1)(b)(2) provided that the established FiT would remain

Award

Page 38 of 204

the same for a period of 15 years subject to the industrial producer price index.*° Second, under
Article 6(4) of the Act on Promotion, the FiT set by the ERO in any given year was not allowed

to be decreased by more than 5% of the value of the FiT in the previous year (“5% rule”).*°

In the same year in which the Act on Promotion entered into force, various governmental officials
and entities of the Czech Republic promoted the Incentive Regime for RES producers and
emphasised the importance of the guaranteed electricity purchase price on several occasions.*”
In particular, Mr. Martin Bursik, one of the co-authors of the Act on Promotion, who became
Minister of Environment from 2007 to 2009, stated in his article dated 1 June 2005 that the most
important principle of the Act on Promotion was “the guarantee of a stable feed-in tariff for a 15-

year period following the launch of the power station into operation.”**

According to Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion, the indicative technical and economic

parameters for the fixing of the FiT were to be established by implementing regulations issued
by the ERO.

By Regulation No. 475/2005 Coll. (“Technical Regulation”) dated 30 November 2005 and
amended in 2007 and 2009, the ERO set out the general technical and economic parameters in
order for newly installed plants to achieve the 15-year payback period provided by Article
6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion.® Section 4 of the Technical Regulation stated that:

In order for the 15-year pay-back period to be assured through the support by Purchase Prices
[FiT] of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and economic parameters of
an installation producing electricity from renewable sources must be satisfied, where the
producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve, with the given level of
Purchasing Prices

a) an adequate return on invested capital during the total life of the
installation, such return to be determined by the weighted average cost of
capital (WACC), and

b) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the
installation, using a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero.*°
In 2007 and until the end of 2010, ERO set the weighted average cost of capital (““WACC”) level
used to calculate the FiT at 7%.*' It moreover applied the maximum 5% annual Tariffs reduction
required by Section 6(4) of the Act on Promotion.” Furthermore, it amended the Technical
Regulation in 2007, confirmed in 2009, to fix the estimated lifetime of new photovoltaic plants
at 20 years."* The period during which the FiT would apply was correspondingly extended from

15 to 20 years.

In 2009, the ERO is

which provided for an annual increase of the FiT:

 

ued Regulation No. 140/2009 Coll. (“Pricing Regulation”), Article 2(9) of

Feed-in tariffs and Green bonuses stipulated by the Act on Promotion are applied
throughout the estimated lifetime of plants determined by the regulation implementing
some provisions of the Act on Promotion. The Feed-in tariffs increase annually
throughout the lifetime of the plant classified in the respective category depending on the
type of the renewable resource used and the date of launch into operation with respect to
the industrial producers’ price index by a minimum of 2% and maximum of 4%, with the
exception of biomass and bio gas burning plants.*°
The above regulation thus established that payment of the FiT and Green Bonuses was guaranteed
throughout the estimated lifetime of photovoltaic power plants and the FiT was to increase
annually by a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 4% “taking into account the inflation price

index for industrial producers over the lifetime of the plant.”“°

According to the Claimant, the ERO was still promoting the Incentive Regime at the beginning
of 2008. On 27 February 2008, Mr. Rostislav Krejcar, the ERO’s head of department for RES,

made a presentation on the Incentive Regime, which was attended by Mr. Pavel Capek, who was

presentation stated, inter alia, that “purchase prices and green bonuses are applied throughout the
life time of electricity producers [...] photovoltaic power [plants] 20 years (since 1.1.2008)” and
that “[d]uring the life time of electricity production plant the purchase prices shall be increased
with regards to increasing the Industrial Producers’ Price Index at least by 2% and a maximum

of 4%, with the exception of biomass and biogas”."*

According to the Claimant, the Act on Promotion, the relevant ERO regulations and the Act on
Income Tax jointly established the incentive regime, which offered investments in the
photovoltaic sector the FiT or alternatively Green Bonuses, the Income Tax Exemption and the
Shortened Depreciation Period (the “Incentive Regime”).*” The Respondent has a different
understanding, namely that the regime provided by the Czech Republic was not photovoltaic-
focused. According to this view, while the Act on Promotion and the relevant ERO regulations
provided an incentive scheme as to the entire RES by granting either the FiT or the Green
Bonuses, the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period did not constitute

part of it.

On 15 October 2009, Mr. Krejcar delivered another presentation concerning the Incentive
Regime. Although it is unclear whether this presentation was attended by any of the Claimant’s
representatives or employees, the information contained therein was made available to the
Claimant.* That presentation is depicted by the Respondent as a warning to the investors
regarding the upcoming changes in the Incentive Regime.*' In particular, the presentation stated
that “the economic return [...] at the current prices is in conflict with the guaranteed return
pursuant to the law and is almost half” of the 15-year period.” At the same time, as noted by the

Claimant, the presentation provided that “[p]urchase prices and green bonuses are applied for the

In late 2008, as explained by the Claimant, the Czech solar energy sector became particularly

attractive for foreign investors, due to the decrease in prices of photovoltaic components. **

THE CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC

The Claimant was incorporated in Cyprus at the beginning of 2007.** It was founded and owned

at all times by Czech nationals.*°

On 29 October 2008, the Claimant decided to invest in the Czech solar business through the
acquisition of, and equity contributions in, a Czech limited liability company, Lambreti Estates
s.t.0., which was renamed SolarOne s.r.0. (“SolarOne”) upon its acquisition.*’ In particular, on
1 December 2008, the Claimant purchased from Corporate Consulting a.s. the entire share capital
of SolarOne for EUR 9,643.** On 21 January 2009, the Claimant made an equity contribution of
EUR 390,000 to SolarOne.*® In August 2009, the Claimant provided a further EUR 2,708,000

Mr. Chroustovsky purchased the remaining 10% from Mr. Szolony for CZK.
was given a call option upon these remaining shares to be exercised within 20 years.® This
transaction was concluded because the Czech Commercial Code prevented a sole shareholder
from holding 100% in a limited liability company until 1 January 2014 when this rule was

abolished.

The shareholdings in Tomsan were rebalanced on the day of the share purchase, i.e. 27 August
2009, so that 1% was assigned to Mr. Chroustovsky and 99% to SolarOne.*” On 3 November
2009, SolarOne purchased Mr. Chroustovsky’s 1% stake in Tomsan for CZK 1.“ Consequently,
Tomsan is entirely controlled by SolarOne. On 29 December 2009, SolarOne purchased from
Union Lesni Brana a.s. the entire share capital of Sluneéni park Dubi (“Sluneéni”) for CZK
2,200,000.” In the meantime, i.e. in November 2009, Mr. Chroustovsky had acquired 10% of the
SolarOne shares, which he continues to own but upon which the Claimant has a call option.” On

AMENDMENTS TO THE RES REGIME THAT RESULTED IN THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE
CLAIMANT’S RIGHTS UNDER THE BIT AND/OR THE ECT

The events described below unfolded in the following political context in the Czech Republic. In
March 2009, the government of the then-incumbent Prime Minister Mr. Mirek Topolanek
resigned after a vote of no confidence.” In May 2009, a temporary government lead by the new
Prime Minister Jan Fischer was sworn in.” This temporary government was in power for more
than a year. During that period, it undertook not to “open any politically contentious, polarising
issues during its term in office” and not to “submit to the Chamber of Deputies any politically or
ideologically polarising legislative proposals”. Only in July 2010 was the new government
finally formed, following the elections that were scheduled for October 2009, but were postponed

by the Czech Constitutional Court until May 2010.”

In June 2009, while the temporary government was still in power, the Czech media reported about
“the ongoing solar boom” in the Czech solar energy sector and quoted Mr. Josef Fiit, the then
head of the ERO, according to whom “[t]he solar electricity feed-in tariff has gone in some

instances economically beyond the limit as the distributors are forced to enhance power lines,

which makes electricity more expensive for consumers.”* Therefore, as further reported by the
Czech media, the ERO was “seeking ways to reduce the solar energy feed-in tariff
dramatically.”*! However, as reported, under the existing laws, the ERO was not allowed to
“lower the RES electricity feed-in tariff by more than 5% per year. This is why it [was] trying to

agree an amendment to the rules with the government and members of parliament.”**

On 25 June 2009, a new EU directive 2009/28/EC dated 23 April 2009 replaced the 2001
Directive with the aim of establishing a common framework for the promotion of energy from
RES (“2009 Directive”).*’ The 2009 Directive fixed the Czech Republic’s new target for the
contribution of electricity produced from RES at 13% by 2020 (“2020 target”)."! Its preamble
furthermore stated that “[o]ne important means to achieve the aim of this Directive is to guarantee
the proper functioning of national support schemes, as under Directive 2001/77/EC, in order to
maintain investor confidence and allow Member States to design effective national measures for

target compliance”.*

Between July 2008 and August 2009, the ERO sent several letters to the Ministry of Industry and
Trade regarding the situation in the Czech solar energy sector.“ On 4 July 2008, Mr. Fiit sent a
letter to the Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade emphasizing that grid operators would have
to make significant investments into infrastructure in view of the increased number of requests
for connection to the grid.*’ By letter dated 1 July 2009, Mr. Fiit informed the Minister of
Industry and Trade that investors in the photovoltaic energy were put at “an unprecedented
advantage over investors and producers of other types of renewable resources” due to the

decreased cost of investment. ** Mr. Fiit also stressed that the on-going growth in the photovoltaic

sector “leads to a speculative block of connection capacities at the level of the distribution
systems” and ultimately would result in a significant financial burden on Czech customers. ® In
view of these considerations, Mr. Fiit proposed to repeal the 5% rule so that the ERO would be
allowed to adjust the FiT.” By letter dated 10 August 2009, Mr. Blahoslav Némeéek, vice-
chairman and director of the regulatory section of the ERO, informed Mr. Roman PortuzZak,
acting director of the electric power department at the Ministry of Industry and Trade, that Mr.
Fiit “had already approached the minister of industry and trade [...] and [...] received a positive
response expressing readiness of the MIT to cooperate” on the amendments to the Act on

Promotion.”!

On 24 August 2009, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued a press release communicating its
intention to abolish the 5% rule starting from 1 January 2010 since “the grant policy from the
part of the state [in the photovoltaic sector] has ceased to fulfil its primary function, because
support for solar power stations has shifted from an area of necessary state support for its
existence to the position of a branch where profit is guaranteed regardless of the situation on the
market.””?

On 28 August 2009, Mr. Portuzak (MIT) sent to Mr. Némeéek (ERO) a letter acknowledging the
“huge” growth in the solar energy sector and the future unsustainability of the existing regulatory
regime. > At the same time, Mr. Portuzak noted “the goal of section 6(4) [of the Act on
Promotion] was to ensure the investors in renewable sources certainty of payback of their
in 0 p , and p . A simple ion could thus entail a risk of
suits filed by investors against the Czech Republic on grounds of lost investment.”** Mr. Portuzak
further stated that the MIT “is preparing the implementation of the 2009 Directive into the Czech

be commissioned in 2010”.°°

By letter dated 8 September 2009, Mr. Fiit informed Mr. Vojit, Chairman of the Economic
Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, that the 5% rule needed to be amended.” The same letter
enclosed a legislative draft enabling the ERO to disregard the 5% rule when setting the purchase
prices for 2011 and thereafter “for those types of renewable resources, for which an investment
return of less than eleven years is achieved in the year, in which a decision is made on the new
purchase prices”.”” Mr. Fiit also noted that “[iJnvestors will be able to prepare sufficiently in
advance for the change in the conditions for investing which should eliminate entirely the risk of

possible lawsuits in the Czech Republic regarding protection of investments.”

On 16 November 2009, the Government introduced to Parliament an explanatory report on draft
Act No. 137/2010 essentially reflecting the legislative draft and the explanations provided by Mr.
Fit to Mr. Vojit in the aforementioned letter dated 8 September 2009.”

On the same day, during the Government’s press conference, Mr. Vladimir ToSovsky (Minister
of Industry and Trade) clarified that the Incentive Regime would remain unchanged for 2010.
Mr. ToSovsky further explained that draft Act No. 137/2010 would reduce the incentive only
from 2011, because some investors had already invested in on-going projects and the change of
“the terms and conditions under which they invested in the course of the development [...] could

pose a threat to their investment.”!°°

the proposed amendments to the Act on Promotion during its March session, noting that the RES
support “should be set fairly, to guarantee a long-term return on investment, not excessive

profits."

On 17 March 2010, Parliament adopted Act No. 137/2010, amending the Act on Promotion by
abolishing from | January 2011 the 5% rule “for those types of renewable resources, which, in
the year in which the new feed-in tariffs are being determined, achieve the investment return
shorter than 11 years.”! According to the Claimant, this amendment concerned only those plants
that were connected to the grid after 2011.'*

In July 2010, in accordance with Article 4 of the 2009 Directive, the Czech Ministry of Industry
and Trade published a “National Renewable Energy Action Plan”, providing a roadmap of how
the Czech Republic planned to attain its 2020 target for the contribution of renewable energies to

its energy consumption (“2010 Action Plan”).!°°

The 2010 Action Plan, inter alia, mentioned
tax exemptions as part of the incentive scheme.'® It also confirmed the FiT level for plants
connected in 2010 and its 20-year duration of the guaranteed FiT.'”” Furthermore, the 2010
Action Plan approved an increase in PV generation capacity for 2010 and stated that there were
no caps on either the total volume of electricity produced per year or of installed capacity that

was entitled to the FiT.'*

Also in July 2010, the Prime Minister and the Minister of Environment of the Czech Republic

On 15 September 2010, the Government submitted to Parliament draft Act No. 330/2010 in
which it proposed to withdraw subsidies from all but the smallest solar installations. ''° The draft
Act provided, inter alia, that “[p]hotovoltaic power plants already connected to the electric power
system will have their right to claim support preserved under existing conditions”.''’ A week
later, the Government instructed the Minister of Industry and Trade and the Minister of
Environment to create a coordination committee in order to prepare “an analysis of the impacts
of support for renewable resources on energy prices and potential proposals for resolution of the

a 112

matter”.

In the course of October 2010, the Government submitted to Parliament draft legislation
amending the Act on Income Tax and the Act on Promotion to introduce a subsidy to be provided

by the Czech Republic to the grid operators.’ The draft legislation contained, inter alia, the
following provision: “[t]he right to receive Support for the production of electricity from sources
using energy from solar radiation that are connected to the transmission grid or distribution

system, as such right arises under existing legal regulations, shall be maintained”.!'*

On 20 October 2010, the Government stated on its website that the discussion regarding measures
preventing an increase of electricity prices had been closed and one of the measures “will be

distribution system operators.'* Second, Act No. 165/2012 introduced an obligation to pay the
“negative electricity hourly price”, which was designed to be paid to the Mandatory Purchasers
by RES operators entitled to the FiT or to be deducted from the payable FiT by the Mandatory
Purchasers, if the price of electricity on the daily market had a negative value, i.e., when the grid
was experiencing a surplus, causing the market price to turn negative.'”* Third, Act No. 165/2012

introduced certain recycling fees for the disposal of photovoltaic panels. “" At the same time, the

New Act on Promotion did not affect the tariffs guaranteed to the existing installations under the

Act on Promotion.”

On 13 September 2013, Act No. 310/2013 Coll. entered into force. This Act extended the Solar
Levy’s application after 31 December 2013 and reduced the Solar Levy to 10% for payments
received under the FiT system and to 11% for payments received under the Green Bonuses
system, '**
On 5 November 2013, the Czech Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade, Mr. Pavel Sole,
announced that the Czech Republic planned to amend Act No. 165/2012 Coll., stating that there

would be introduced:

promotion exceeds the amount of EUR 200,000 in 3 years, after a certain time period we

which would have an adverse effect on the market.!?°

On 14 February 2014, the new Czech government announced its plans to “review the renewable
energy sources promotion system in order to decrease its impacts on the competitiveness of the
Czech industry and to support all the efforts leading to rigorous investigation of the promotion

payable to the existing photovoltaic power plants.”'*°

In accordance with Article 6(1) of the Act on Promotion and Article 4(7) of Act No. 165/2012
Coll., the ERO, by virtue of an annual “Price Decision”, sets the level of FiT and Green Bonuses
applicable to RES plants to be connected in the following year and the 2% to 4% yearly FiT
increase applicable to plants connected in the previous years.'*! On 19 November 2015, the ERO
issued Price Decision No. 5/2015, which set the FiT applicable as of 1 January 2016 only to
plants commissioned from 2013 to 2015, but not to plants put into operation from 2006 to 2012,

including the plant of the Claimant, thereby effectively repealing the FiT altogether.’

On 28 December 2015, the Czech Government adopted Regulation No. 402/2015, which
overruled ERO Price Decision No. 5/2015 and provided that the incentives to RES plants
commissioned before 2013 must be paid, pending any decision by the EC on their compliance
with EU state aid law.'*? In response, on 29 December 2015, the ERO issued Price Decision No.
9/2015, setting FiT and Green Bonuses for RES plants commissioned since 2006, including the

Claimant's plant.'**

REVIEW OF THE RESPONDENT’S AMENDMENTS TO THE RES REGIME BY THE CZECH
Courts

Following the introduction of the Solar Levy and the abolition of the Income Tax Provisions, a
group of Czech senators (“Petitioners”) brought a challenge to the Czech Constitutional Court,

seeking the annulment of these measures.'*°

The Petitioners asserted that these measures violated a number of Czech and international legal

norms, including the right to property, the right to engage in an enterprise and conduct a business,
the principle of the rule of law, and the principle of equality before the law.'*° With respect to the

Solar Levy, the Petitioners argued that solar investors:

received very significant assurances from state authorities that they could expect [...]
revenues from the production of energy under the framework of the regime stipulated by
such Act, and such Act did not stipulate that certain of such producers would face a levy
obligation [...] Such expectations constituted legitimate expectations.'*”

According to the Petitioners, the withdrawal of the Income Tax Provisions, constituted:

a case of arbitrariness on the part of lawmakers, since they could have opted for a vacatio

legis period long enough to give the relevant taxpayer that began their entrepreneurial

activities at any time during the period when the previously existing legal regulation was.

in effect the ability to use the tax exemption on an equal footing and for the same period

of time.'*
In response to the Petitioners’ complaint, and upon invitation by the Czech Constitutional Court,
the Czech Government, including the ERO, and both houses of the Czech Parliament, made
submissions opposing the complaint.'°
On 15 May 2012, the Czech Constitutional Court upheld the measures, finding that neither the
introduction of the Solar Levy nor the withdrawal of the Income Tax Provisions violated the
Czech Constitution as long as Czech law provided for mechanisms to mitigate any “strangling”
or “suffocating” effects. '*°
Having recapitulated the arguments put to it, the Czech Constitutional Court stated, inter alia,
that:

The Constitutional Court has not ignored the fact that it had been the state that
guaranteed, by means of a law, a fifteen-year payback period on investment and a certain
amount of revenues per unit of electricity produced from renewable sources, thereby
motivating the affected entities to undertake entrepreneurial activities in the area of
energy production from renewable sources. '“!

The principle of legal certainty cannot be viewed as being identical to a requirement of

absolute unchangeability of legal regulation, since legal regulation is subject to, among

other things, social and economic changes and the requirement of ensuring that the state

budget remains stable."
Following the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, individual photovoltaic investors
brought proceedings against their tax administrations, alleging that, in their particular case, the
Solar Levy had a “strangling effect” on them.'"’ By late 2013, several cases reached the Czech
Supreme Administrative Court as the highest Czech Court competent in taxation matters, which
denied all claims, noting, inter alia, that “[t]he Constitutional Court’s instruction to take
liquidating effects of the solar power levy into account in individual cases can only be carried
out under current legislation using the institute of tax remission pursuant” to the Tax Procedure
Code.'*

On 10 July 2014, the Czech Supreme Administrative Court ruled that the Solar Levy was “in
nature a decrease in governmental subsidy and not a tax” and therefore it did not cause double

taxation on the income of solar electricity producers. '*°

On 18 September 2014, in response to the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, the Czech

 

Financial Administration stated as follows:

Producers potentially affected by the individual effect of the solar levy found by the
Constitutional Court to be “strangling” have been and are able to at least mitigate, if not
fully eliminate, its impact using standard tools [e.g. tax deferral or payment in
instalments] under the Tax Administration Law.“

THE EC’s DECISIONS ON COMPATIBILITY OF THE RES REGIME WITH EU STATE AID LAW

On 8 January 2013, the Czech Republic notified the EC that it had passed the New Act on

Promotion (“First Notification”).'*”

On 12 June 2014, the EC issued its decision that the financial support foreseen by the New Act

on Promotion was granted directly from the State budget and, therefore, involved State aid, but

THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all claims brought by the

Claimant.'*?

The Claimant contends that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims it has brought.'*

The Parties’ respective arguments are set out in detail in the sections which follow.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT IS AN “INVESTOR” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE BIT
1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that, pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is
confined to disputes involving an investor of the other Contracting Party. Under the definition of
investor set out in Article 1(2), an investor may be a legal person of a Contracting Party,'™ which,
according to Article 1(2)(b), is an entity “incorporated or constituted in accordance with, and
recognized as a legal person by its laws, having the permanent seat in the territory of that

Contracting Party”.'**

According to the Respondent, the Claimant does not meet the required
condition of having a permanent seat in Cyprus.'** It follows, so says the Respondent, that the

Claimant is not an investor within the meaning of the BIT.'*”

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s explanation as to why it is seated in Cyprus ignores
the “effet utile” of the jurisdictional requirement by conflating the concepts of permanent seat
and registered offices.'** In particular, the Respondent submits that the Greek-language version
of the BIT, in which “permanent seat” is preceded by “and”, lends further support to its

interpretation.'?

In order to determine whether an investor has a permanent seat in a host country, the Respondent
argues in favour of test which, as held in Tenaris S.A. and Talta-Trading E Marketing Sociedade
Unipessoal LDA vy. Venezuela, takes into account the ordinary meaning of the term as the place
of actual or effective management and not merely that of registration.'© The Respondent submits
that this test is applicable to the present circumstances because the Claimant’s incorporation
under Cypriot law requires a registered office’®' and the BIT’s requirements in respect of both
incorporation and seat in the definition of investor must be satisfied.'” In addition, this test is
consistent with the purpose of BITs in general, as exemplified by the decision in Alps Finance

and Trade AG v. Slovakia and the object and purpose of the BIT. '*

The Respondent contends that, contrary to the Claimant’s argument that it is a mere holding
company that cannot reasonably be expected to maintain extensive offices, the Claimant is indeed
required to demonstrate that it is effectively managed from Cyprus by reference to its actual
activities on the date it consented to arbitration.'“ Otherwise, an incentive to create opaque
corporate layers to ensure treaty coverage would be created, which would defeat the BIT’s

purpose."

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that on 10 June 2011, the date
it consented to arbitration, its effective administration took place in Cyprus.’ It says that the

Claimant has failed to satisfy a number of requirements, as set out below.

The Respondent notes that the Claimant does not appear to have its own offices in Cyprus and
does not pay (and has not paid) rent for any premises in Cyprus.'®” To the extent that the Claimant
asserts that it uses the offices of Worthald Partners, the Respondent notes that this is an advisory

firm involved in the Claimant’s investment decisions and which is managed by Mr.

member of the Investment Committee of, the Claimant.'® Further, Worthald’s address in Cyprus
is also the registered address of numerous other companies, two of which serve as the Claimant’s

sole director and corporate secretary, respectively.'”

As for meetings of the board of directors, the Claimant refers to a plurality of Cypriot directors,
but the only entity that features as being represented in the minutes is CCY Management, which
is part of the Citeo Group of Companies. CCY Management offers an array of services, including
corporate secretarial services such as attending meetings. The Respondent considers it likely that
CCY Management, as the Claimant’s sole Cypriot director, is a nominee director affiliated with
Citco, and that the alleged regular meetings of the Claimant’s director at the registered office
were routinely held meetings constitutive of services provided by Citco.'”! As for meetings of
the shareholders allegedly held at the Claimant’s seat, Mr. Milorad Vujnovic, a director for CCY

Management, signed by proxy on behalf of the Claimant’s three Czech shareholders.'”

So far as the Claimant’s managers are concerned, the Claimant failed to demonstrate that
Mr. Chroustovsky, Mr. Petr. Sykora and Mr. Jan Cerny, all Czech nationals and residents, are
located in Cyprus.'” Similarly, the Claimant provided no evidence that it has any employees in

Cyprus. Indeed, if there were any, it appears that they were in the Czech Republic.'™

of its management records.'’ Moreover, the Claimant’s tax returns show that it neither owns nor
rents property in Cyprus.'”” Contrary to its assertion, the Claimant has also not submitted any
evidence, except for an audit by a third-party Cypriot firm, to prove that its seat is in Cyprus.'*
While it apparently filed tax returns in Cyprus in 2009 and 2010, there is no record that the

Claimant made any payment of taxes in Cyprus in those years.'”

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s use of a bank account with a Cypriot bank amounted
to a “momentarily funnelling” of “Czech funds”. It points to certain transactions involving
millions of Euros, the source of which is redacted, and which appear to correspond to sums
accruing to the Claimant’s directors and shareholders, deposited in September 2009 in the

Cypriot bank account and promptly transferred back to SolarOne.'*”

The Respondent further contends that the Claimant has not even established that it had a
registered office in Cyprus, which is the requirement under the standard it advocates. The
Respondent argues that a certificate of incorporation furnishes no conclusive evidence as to the

existence of a registered office.'*!

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant contends that it has a “permanent seat” in Cyprus and is consequently a “foreign

investor” under the BIT.'?

According to the Claimant, in order to qualify as a Cypriot investor, it is sufficient to maintain a
registered office in Cyprus. Under Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, a “registered office” is the same as

a “seat”, as held in Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine and Total v. Argentina in relation to similar

provisions.'*’ The Claimant argues that the fulfilment of this requirement is evidenced by the

certificate issued by the Registrar of Companies of Nicosia on 29 September 2010.'**

The Claimant further contends that, even if it were considered a “shell company”, it would remain
entitled to the protection afforded by the BIT, since the requirement of a seat is merely formal
and a stringent economic nexus to Cyprus need not be established.'** It says this contention finds
support in Article 63(2) of EU Regulation 1215/2012, whereby “statutory seat”, as applied to

Cyprus, Ireland and the United Kingdom, is regarded as equivalent to “registered office”.'*°

The Claimant also relies upon the absence in the BIT of any express exclusion from investment
treaty protection in the case of entities lacking substantive connection to their place of
incorporation, as observed in Cypriot and Czech investment treaty practice. The Claimant adds
that Cypriot law, which is relevant to determine the ordinary meaning of “seat”, does not

recognize the concept of “real seat” (siege réel).'*"

In addition, the Claimant contends that it is a Cypriot investor, even if it were accepted that for it
to have a seat in Cyprus it must have its central management or administration there. The
Claimant submits that it operates in Cyprus, as evidenced by the facts that (1) it holds a bank
account with a Cypriot bank, used to transfer funds to SolarOne; (2) its financial statements are
audited by Cypriot accountants; (3) it pays taxes in Cyprus; (4) it has Cypriot directors regularly

meeting at its registered office; and (5) its shareholders also regularly hold meetings at the seat.'**

In this connection, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's reliance on Alps Finance and Trade
v. Slovak Republic is inapposite, since the BIT does not contain, unlike the Swiss-Slovak
Republic BIT, any provision requiring that “real economic activities” be carried out by an
investor in order to establish that it has a seat in the asserted jurisdiction.'* By reference to the

protection under the BIT is not conditional on evidence of extensive management responsibilities.
On the contrary, given that Cypriot legislation favours the establishment of holding companies
in its territory and that such companies were not excluded from protection under the BIT,
evidence that the Claimant’s shareholders’ and board of directors’ meetings were held in Cyprus

is sufficient to prove that the Claimant had its seat in Cyprus.'”°

Furthermore, the Claimant contests the Respondent’s objections that the Claimant was not a

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal notes that considerable disagreement exists between the Parties as to whether the
Claimant qualifies as an “investor” under the BIT.'* In this regard, the main question which
divides the Parties appears to be whether having a “registered office” is sufficient for a legal
entity incorporated under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties to the BIT to fulfil the
requirement of “having the permanent seat in the territory of that Contracting Party” pursuant to
Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.'° Despite the fact that the Tribunal finds jurisdiction under the ECT,
which does not contain the requirement of a permanent seat, it must decide this question as it

relates to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, rationae personae, under the BIT.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that the Claimant qualifies as an “investor” under the BIT. In

particular, for the reasons more fully explored below, the Tribunal finds itself in agreement with

the Respondent to the extent that the latter argues that a registered office is insufficient to satisfy

the requirement of “having the permanent seat” set out in Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT.

The Tribunal recalls that the interpretation of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT is governed by the

Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. This is not disputed by the Parties. A series of key

propositions flow from these VCLT provisions.

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers that the interpretation of the BIT, including
Article 1(2)(b) thereof, is governed exclusively by international law. Reference to domestic law,
including the internal laws of the Contracting Parties to the BIT, is to be made only if, and to the
extent, permitted by international law (as would be the case, for example, if the BIT contained

an express renvoi).

As Article 31 of the VCLT provides, the first step of the interpretative exercise entails
consideration of the ordinary meaning of the terms of the BIT provision, considered in their
context and in the light of the treaty’s object and purpose. The treaty practice of the Parties to the
BIT and other acts which are a source of obligations for the Parties to the BIT, such as EU
regulations, may be taken into account “together with the context” of the BIT, to the extent that
they set out, or are grounded upon, “relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations

between the parties” pursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.

If the text of a provision of the BIT comprises some elements which justify a renvoi to domestic
law, and some which do not, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to refer to domestic
law for all purposes of its interpretation. In particular, where a provision of the BIT has a
separable grammatical structure, those elementsthat do not require a renvoi to domestic law must
retain their autonomous meaning under international law, whereas those (separable) elements

that envisage a renvoi must be approached differently.'°”

On the basis of the above preliminary considerations, the Tribunal now turns to the interpretation

of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT and the Parties’ arguments in support of their respective positions.

Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, it will be recalled, provides as follows:

The term “legal person” shall mean, with respect to either Contracting Party, any entity
incorporated or constituted in accordance with, and recognized as legal person by its laws,
having the permanent seat in the territory of the Contracting Party.

The Tribunal finds it useful to analyse the text of the provision in terms of its grammatical
structure and syntactical features, before proceeding to establish the content of the elements of

the definition it sets out.

The opening part of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT contains the definiendum, or object, namely the
term “legal person”.'°* The remainder of the sentence concerns the definiens and is composed of
three elements, as follows: (1) “any entity incorporated or constituted in accordance with,” (2)
“and recognized as legal person by its laws,” (3) “having the permanent seat in the territory of
the Contracting Party.” The first two phrases are of an equal nature, which follows from the use

of the conjunction “and”, and both are jointly qualified by the third phrase.

Given this structure, the Tribunal finds that there are three cumulative conditions which must be
satisfied by “any entity” in order to qualify as an “investor” under the BIT.'°° The Tribunal also

notes that the fact that the three elements are cumulative is not contested by the Parties.

As for the first two elements, the Tribunal notes that Article 1(2)(b) subjects both the
incorporation or constitution of a legal entity and the recognition of the legal entity to the internal

law of the respective Contracting Party.

As for the third element, namely “having the permanent seat”, the Tribunal observes that the term
“seat” is employed in a qualified manner, as part of the phrase “having the permanent seat in the
territory of that Contracting Party.” While a renvoi to domestic law governing the incorporation
or constitution of a legal entity and its recognition as a legal person is required, the interpretation
and application of the third element does not require such a renvoi. Notably, this approach is

consistent with that taken by the tribunal in Orascom TMT Investments S.4 r.1 Algeria”

In connection with the third element, the Parties disagree as to (1) whether an effective
interpretation of the BIT must lead to the conclusion that the third element differs from, and adds
to, the requirements set out in the two first elements; and — if so — (2) the content of the third

element.

The full opening phrase of the sentence’s main, and only, clause is as follows: “[t]he term “legal person”

shall mean, with respect to either Contracting Party, [...]”.

The Parties have invoked a number of decisions in support of their respective positions on these

is 201

 

es. Whereas the Respondent has relied extensively on the decision in Tenaris,” the Claimant
has based its reasoning upon the decisions in Tokios Tokelés and Total.” More particularly, the
Respondent has advanced what it considers to be the ordinary meaning of the phrase “permanent
seat”, as construed in light of the object and purpose of the BIT, of its effet utile and of investment
treaties in general.*”* In contrast, to substantiate its position that a registered office is sufficient,
the Claimant relies on the ordinary meaning of “seat”, the investment treaty practice of the Parties
to the BIT, the use in relation to Cyprus of “statutory seat” as equivalent to “registered office” in

Article 63(2) of EU Regulation 1215/2012, and Cypriot domestic law.™

In the Tribunal’s view, on a proper analysis, the element of Article 1(2)(b) that requires an

autonomous interpretation, without recourse to domestic law, has not been satisfied in this case.

 

The Tribunal first observes that, contrary to the Claimant’s submission, the enquiry mandated by
the BIT on this issue does not involve Cypriot law. As noted above, while a renvoi is expressly
made in connection with the incorporation or constitution and recognition elements set out in
Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, this renvoi does not extend to the third element in issue here. Hence,
the alleged non-recognition of the concept of “real seat” in Cypriot law has no bearing on the
Tribunal’s determination of the content of the requirement of “having the permanent seat” in

Cyprus. This is a requirement autonomous and independent from Cypriot law.

Likewise, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant’s contention that the requirement of “having
the permanent seat” in Cyprus is to be interpreted as co-extensive with the concept of a “statutory
seat” and, in particular, with the place of office registration as provided for in Article 63(2) of
EU Regulation 1215/2012. The definition of “legal person” under the BIT is a matter of
international law. While an EU regulation may be taken into account, together with the context
of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, in the present case, given the specific features of Article 1(2)(b) of
the BIT, the Tribunal does not consider the definition in Article 63(2) of EU Regulation
1215/2012 relevant to its enquiry.

As to the precise meaning of the requirement of “having the permanent seat”, under
Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT, the Tribunal agrees with the Tenaris tribunal’s approach, albeit

rendered in different circumstances.

In Tenaris, the tribunal interpreted and applied two provisions. First, Article 1(1)(b) of the

Portugal-Venezuela BIT, which employs the term “seat” (“sede”) without any qualification.”

Second, Article 1(B) of the Belgium/Luxembourg-Venezuela BIT, which uses “seat” in a
qualified manner, as part of the phrase “corporate seat” (“siége social”). The Tenaris tribunal
held that both the text of the provisions and the principle of effectiveness required that the “seat”
requirement, whether qualified or not, be given effect, so that it would necessarily mean
something different from, and additional to, incorporation, and thus more than registration, which
is merely a formal aspect of incorporation. It reasoned further that this additional meaning would
be coextensive with the requirement that “seat” be where “actual or genuine corporate activity”

takes place, which amounts to the place of “actual or effective management” of the legal entity.?”

In line with this analysis, the Tribunal also concludes that “seat” must mean more than mere
registration or incorporation. This all the more so in the present BIT, given that the text of Article
1(2)(b) further qualifies the use of “seat” by adding an additional requirement of permanency.
The text of the provision therefore strongly indicates that the requirement of “having the
permanent seat” must have a meaning separate from the requirements of incorporation or

constitution of a legal entity and recognition of the legal entity as a legal person.

This finding is consistent with the object and purpose of the BIT as stipulated in its preamble. In
particular, the Tribunal’s reading of Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT is consistent with the intention of
the Contracting Parties “to maintain conditions favourable to investments of investors of one
Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party”.*”* It thus ensures that

investment protection is reciprocal, by requiring that a legal entity of one Contracting Party is

Article 1(B) of the Portugal-Venezuela BIT (in Portuguese), reads, in its relevant parts, as follows: “/es

accorded treaty protection only if, among other criteria, it is more than merely incorporated or

registered in the territory of the other Contracting Party.”

The Claimant has submitted, in the alternative to its main argument, that, even if it were
considered a “shell company”, it would remain entitled to treaty protection as an “investor” given
the absence of a “denial of benefits” provision excluding entities lacking a substantive connection
from treaty protection. Further, and in any case, the Claimant argues that it does have a seat in

Cyprus. The Tribunal is unpersuaded on both counts.

The Claimant's first submission relies on a reading whereby the context of the provision, i.e., the
absence of a specific kind of clause in the remainder of the treaty, would trump the express text
of the BIT. This is an impermissible approach to treaty interpretation. But in any event, such a
reading would take no account of the fact that “denial of benefits” provisions tend only to apply
to a legal entity that qualifies as an “investor” under the treaty in the first place, albeit one
controlled by “third-country nationals”.?'° Hence, to the extent that a company without
substantive connection to Cyprus is not an “investor” under the BIT, reasoning based on the

absence of a “denial of benefits” provision in the BIT is of no assistance.

As to the Claimant’s second submission, in the Tribunal’s view the Claimant has not
demonstrated that it has its “permanent seat” in Cyprus. According to the Oxford Dictionary, as
also from obvious standard usage, the adjective “permanent” applies to a state of affairs “[I]asting
or intended to last or remain unchanged indefinitely”, and, in particular, one which is “[IJasting

or continuing without interruption.”7!!

On the basis of the totality of evidence and submissions before it, the Tribunal cannot agree with
the Claimant’s assertion that it has established its permanent seat in Cyprus. The Tribunal
considers that the Claimant does not operate on a permanent basis in Cyprus, and nor is there any

basis to conclude that it has “the permanent seat” there.
In particular, the aspects set out below demonstrate otherwise.

The Claimant’s managers, namely Mr. Chroustovsky, Mr. Petr. Sykora and Mr. Jan Cerny, all of

whom are Czech nationals and residents, were not based in Cyprus.

The Claimant’s employees, if any,?!? were likewise mainly based in the Czech Republic, and had
a limited and temporary involvement in its Cypriot operations, as illustrated by Mr. Sykora’s

participation in SolarOne’s shareholders’ meetings.

The Claimant’s tax returns indicate that it owns or rents no property in Cyprus, nor was any
payment of taxes made in Cyprus for the years of 2009 and 2010, in relation to which the

Claimant had filed tax returns.

The Claimant’s bank account with a Cypriot bank was used temporarily only, to transfer funds

in September 2009, which were promptly transferred back to SolarOne.

Lastly, during his testimony, Mr. Chroustovsky stated that: (1) he permanently resides in the
Czech Republic;7> (2) he had “never visited” and had “never even been” to the Claimant’s office
in Cyprus;?"4 and that (3) he had “never attended in person” any of the Claimant’s shareholders’
meetings and had “never [been] physically there”.?!*

In light of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to embark upon an
analysis as to whether the Claimant has abused investment treaty protection by commencing the

present proceedings.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal determines that the Claimant is not an “investor”
under the BIT, as it does not have “the permanent seat” in Cyprus, pursuant to Article 1(2)(b) of

the BIT. It follows that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction rationae personae.

The Claimant has initiated claims under BIT Article 2(2) (“fair and equitable treatment” and “full
protection and secrutiy”) as well as a claim for “non-impairment” pursuant to the BIT’s Most
Favored Nation Treatment provision on the basis of BIT Article 3(1), 3(2) and 3(4) and on the
German and Netherlands investment treaties concluded with the Czech Republic. However, as

the Tribunal has declined jurisdiction under the BIT, these claim are not admitted.

WHETHER THE CLAIMANT MADE A “FOREIGN” INVESTMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
ECT

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the ECT over investment owned

by domestic investors through a foreign shell company.?'

Pursuant to the text of Article 1(6) of the ECT, which defines the term “investment”, the alleged

investment of the Claimant does not qualify for the purposes of the Article, because it does not

 

exhibit the economic characteristics of an investment, including most notably a contribution
made from outside the host state, as opposed to one which is merely held by the putative
investor.”!’ The Respondent contends that the ECT is to be interpreted as requiring that the

investment be of foreign origin, as an economic characteristic.”

The Respondent further contends that WAIEN’s claim to investment protection implies an abuse
of process and falls short of the requirement that investment protection be conditional on an

investment being mutually beneficial for both home and host states."

The Respondent alleges that WAIEN maintains a purely Czech operation and is a shell company,
the shareholders and beneficial owners of which are three Czech nationals which purchased a
Czech limited liability company and which, in turn, acquired two Czech SPVs to construct two
solar plants in the Czech Republic.” In the Respondent’s submission, the Claimant has merely
disguised its domestic investment as international.” In this regard, the Respondent further
contends that the Claimant’s argument that the BIT and the ECT definitions of nationality do not

call for an inquiry into that of the parties controlling the investor, is inapposite, even if it were

assumed to be correct; the question is not whether the Claimant is a protected investor, but rather

22

whether the investment involved originates from outside the Czech Republic.

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal is not called upon to determine whether the funds it used
originated from outside the Czech Republic, since a requirement concerning the origin of capital
lacks a basis in the text of the ECT and, generally, is not well established as a matter of

international investment law and arbitral jurisprudence.”

To this end, the Claimant contests the soundness and relevance of an inherent meaning test in
determining the existence of an investment.“ Such a test remains controversial. It has been
associated primarily with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention which, unlike the ECT, contains
no definition of investment.” Also, the applicable criteria according to this test are not
necessarily applicable by analogy to the ECT, in which a different concept of investment obtains.
In the rare instances where this test has been applied, tribunals have relied upon it to decline
jurisdiction over straightforward commercial transactions.” The Claimant adds that ECT
tribunals have refrained from basing their determination as to whether a claimant possesses an
investment within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT on an alleged objective meaning of the
term investment.” Furthermore, arbitral tribunals have refused to incorporate additional
requirements into the definition of investment under the applicable treaty on grounds of an

allegedly objective meaning of investment.”

More specifically, the Claimant submits that the origin of the funds underlying the Claimant’s
investment is irrelevant for jurisdictional purposes.” The Claimant argues that, in any event, the

requirement that a financial contribution be made was plainly met by the Claimant: it paid for its

The Claimant submits that its beneficial owners engaged in legitimate nationality planning,
particularly in light of the fact that its incorporation took place well in advance of the Measures.
The Claimant emphasises that the Respondent has failed to address the only aspect of potential
relevance to a determination of the existence of an alleged “abuse of process” in this instance,
namely the timing of the Claimant’s investment.?*! The Claimant submits that no question of
“manufacturing” jurisdiction arose, because its investments were in place before any dispute. The
Claimant was incorporated four years in advance of the challenged measures and made its

232

investments without any hint as to a dispute with the Respondent.

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal notes the Parties’ disagreement as to whether the Claimant has made an investment
within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT. In particular, the Parties disagree as to whether

an investment requires the contribution of funds which originate from outside the host state.

It is recalled that the Respondent relies primarily upon the decisions in Nova Scotia** and
Standard Chartered,™ to argue that a contribution of foreign origin is required by the inherent
meaning of the term “investment”. The Claimant contests the existence and, if any, the relevance
of an inherent meaning of investment. In the alternative, it submits that it made an investment

which satisfies such an inherent conception by making an appropriate financial contribution.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that funds must originate from outside the host state for a
contribution so funded to qualify as an investment under the ECT. The Tribunal agrees with the
Claimant that the primary basis for the Tribunal’s decision is the text of the ECT. It reaches its
conclusion on this basis and does not deem it necessary to address the Parties’ submissions in the

alternative, or those regarding the existence of an inherent meaning of investment.

Treaties. That is not disputed by the Parties. Further, and again as noted previously in this Award,

con:

 

nt with Article 31 of the VCLT, the ordinary meaning of the terms of a treaty provision,
considered in their context and in the light of its object and purpose, forms the first step of any

interpretive exercise.

Article 1(6) of the ECT reads as follows:

As used in this Treaty:
[Lu]
(6) “Investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an
Investor and includes:
(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property, and any property
rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;
(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity
participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt ofa company
or business enterprise;
(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic
value and associated with an Investment;
(d) Intellectual Property;
(c) Returns;
(£) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits granted
pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector. A change in
the form in which assets are invested does not affect their character as investments and
the term “Investment” includes all investments, whether existing at or made after the
later of the date of entry into force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party of the Investor
making the investment and that for the Contracting Party in the Area of which the
investment is made (hereinafter referred to as the “Effective Date”) provided that the
Treaty shall only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective Date.
“Investment” refers to any investment associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy
Sector and to investments or classes of investments designated by a Contracting Party in its
Area as “Charter efficiency projects” and so notified to the Secretariat.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that Article 1(6) of the ECT establishes a requirement as to the
foreign origin of the funds of an investment. In particular, the Tribunal notes that Article 1(6)
refers to “every kind of asset”, regardless of the origin of the funds for its acquisition. The only
restriction is that the asset in question is “owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an
Investor”. The Tribunal considers that whether an investment is owned by an investor is a
question to be determined independent of the question of the origin of the funds employed by an
investor to acquire such investment. Furthermore, while the investor needs to be a national of
another Contracting Party, the ECT does not require that the funds originate in the other

Contracting Party.

The Respondent has relied upon a number of decisions, to the relevance of which the Tribunal
now briefly turns. Most prominently amongst these are the decisions in Nova Scotia and Standard
Chartered.

As the Claimant has correctly observed, in Nova Scotia the tribunal held that the dispute
concerned a sale of goods, which could not be considered an “investment”.** Its reasoning
therefore is not applicable to present circumstances. As for Standard Chartered, the tribunal in

that arbitration found that the use of the verb “made” entailed an investor’s “active” role, “rather
than simple passive ownership.”** In this regard, it suffices to note that, unlike Article I(a) of the
Tanzania-UK BIT, Article 1(6) of the ECT does not employ the verb “made” and expressly
provides for indirect control. In any case, if a requirement as to the degree of involvement of the
investor in the making of an investment were applicable, such requirement would not have any

bearing upon the origin of the funds applied by the investors.

The Parties are also divided as to whether the Claimant’s alleged status

  

is a shell company and
the allegedly domestic nature of its investment preclude treaty protection and the Tribunal’s
exercise of jurisdiction in relation to the Claimant and its contributions under the ECT. In support
of its propositions that treaty protection and the Tribunal’s jurisdiction are precluded, the
Respondent principally relies on the decisions in Phoenix and KT Asia. The Claimant argues that
the Czech nationality of its beneficial owner and the degree of intensity of its economic
connection with Cyprus have no bearing upon the existence and scope of treaty protection under

the ECT.

The Phoenix tribunal considered the bona fide character of the investment to establish whether
“the Claimant engaged in an abusive attempt to get access to ICSID”.?*” Notwithstanding this
fact, which renders the decision inapposite in principle, the Tribunal notes that the Phoenix
tribunal considered the timing of the claim and that, as correctly pointed out by the Claimant, in
this case the Claimant’s incorporation took place before any dispute was foreseeable.?** The
situation was therefore different for the claimant in Phoenix, which notified the dispute to the

respondent before it registered the ownership of the companies at issue in the Czech Republic.””

In relation to KT Asia, the Tribunal notes that the tribunal undertook an inquiry into the meaning
of “investment” under the ICSID Convention, whichhas no application to the present case. In

addition, the parties in that matter had not contested that the “objective definition” of investment

was relevant to both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.’ As such, the decision in KT Asia of

 

limited if any assistance for present purposes. But more than this, the Tribunal observes that,
according to this decision, a commitment of resources must be made, failing which an “asset
belonging to the claimant” is not to be deemed a protected investment. The KT Asia tribunal,
which denied jurisdiction on the sole basis of its finding that no contribution had been made,"
did not interpret the BIT so as to set out a requirement concerning the origin of funds. In this
case, the Claimant has argued that it made a financial contribution. The Respondent does not
seem to contest this proposition, having confined its position in this respect to arguing that the

Claimant’s contribution did not originate outside the host state.

Lastly, the Tribunal has considered the Parties’ submi

 

ions regarding the alleged character of
the Claimant as a shell company, and whether the holding of such an entity is insufficient to

constitute an investment under the BIT.

The Tribunal’s observations regarding the general relevance of the decision in KT Asia above
hold true in relation to this argument as well. Article 1(6) of the ECT neither requires that an
investment belongs to, or be owned by, an entity having a substantial connection with its place
of incorporation, nor does it preclude the protection of an investment made by an entity which
mainly serves as a holding company. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant’s contention that the
ECT does not require that a substantial connection be established for a legal entity to be deemed

an investor and for its investment to be protected.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction ratione materiae over the

Claimant’s investments under the ECT.

WHETHER THE SOLAR LEVY IS A TAX FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE ECT TAX CARVE-OUT
(ARTICLE 21 ECT)

1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Solar Levy as this measure
is a tax under Czech law for purposes of the ECT’s tax exclusion clause set out in Article 21 of

the ECT.” The Respondent observes that the Claimant itself considered the Tax Incentives to

be taxation measures™ and contends that the only disagreement with the Claimant pertains to
the characterization of the Acts which adopted and extended the Solar Levy as “Taxation

Measures”.™**

The Respondent agrees with the Claimant that Article 31 of the VCLT governs the interpretation
of Article 21(7) of the ECT. It submits that the Contracting State parties gave the term “Taxation
Measures” a special meaning, whereby, for the determination of the character of a measure as a
“provision relating to taxes of the domestic law” within the meaning of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the

ECT, the Tribunal “must look to the domestic law of the Czech Republic”.

The Respondent contests all of the Claimant’s arguments which contradict this proposition for
the following reasons (broadly summarized): (1) the use of domestic law to determine the
characterization of a measure as a tax is justified, given the express renvoi to domestic law in
Article 21 of the ECT and the importance of a state’s taxation power, which is admitted by the
Claimant;™° (2) the intention of the ECT’s drafters lends support to the need to resort to domestic
law, as evidenced by Article 21(5) of the ECT, which calls upon competent domestic tax
authorities to state their views as to the limited number of tax-related issues capable of submission
to international arbitration;?”’ (3) the Claimant has not explained why the use of domestic law
would undermine the ECT’s purpose;** and (4) it is not contrary to good faith that states have
resort to their own domestic law, for, as a matter of fact, states are free to opt out of international
obligations. In any event, the Respondent has not sought to act as judge and jury or to escape its
international obligations, as it has accepted that the Tribunal will make the ultimate determination

as to whether the Solar Levy meets the definition set out in Article 21(7) of the ECT.”

The Respondent, referring to the decision in Emmis and others v. Hungary, argues that the
character of the Solar Levy must be established with reference to Czech domestic law. Like any
tax, the Solar Levy has a rate, a base and a taxpayer, and was treated as a tax by the Czech
legislative, executive and judicial organs. This is evidenced, most notably, by its inclusion in the

Tax Administration Law (“TAL”) and its characterization by the Czech Constitutional Court as

a “tax or fee” within the meaning of Article 11(5) of the Czech Republic’s Charter of
Fundamental Rights and Freedoms (“Charter”), holding that the Solar Levy, like any other taxes,
should be “levied only on the basis of the law.””** In this connection, the Respondent notes that
Article 11(5) of the Charter and Section 2(3) of the TAL are legislative instruments for the
purposes of Article 21(7) of the ECT. In response to the Claimant’s argument that Article 11(5)
of the Charter is inconclusive so far as the question whether the Solar Levy constitutes a tax is
concerned, as it refers to “taxes and fees”, the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not argue
that the Solar Levy is a “fee” rather than a “tax”. In addition, the Solar Levy is classified as a tax
by the OECD and EUROSTAT. Moreover, the reason for taxes and fees being treated under the
same umbrella in the TAL is that Czech legal and accounting practice does not differentiate
between taxes and other public charges.”*' Furthermore, the Respondent draws the Tribunal’s
attention to the fact that the ECT only requires that the Solar Levy be a measure “relating to taxes
of the domestic law”, which is presently the case as it is designated as a tax in the Czech
Republic’s Tax Code, is collected as such, and is accounted for and reported as a tax.” Hence,
in light of the above, the Solar Levy qualifies as a “Taxation Measure” under Article 21(7), and

253

is thus covered by the carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT-

The Respondent emphasizes that the character of the Solar Levy must be determined by reference
to Czech legislation, and not to academic literature. In relation to the place of “academic theory”,
the Respondent submits that the ECT does not call for an academic exercise, since Article 21(7)
of the ECT places exclusive reliance upon legislation and the Contracting States’ power to decide
what is a tax. In any event, academic theory is unhelpful in this case, given the inherent lack of

clarity of the term “taxes”, acknowledged in scholarly writing.*** However, even if the Tribunal

were to consider “academic theory” relevant, the Respondent submits that the Solar Levy
possesses the six features identified and relied upon by the Claimant as the test of a taxation
measure.” In particular, it is uncontested that the Solar Levy is obligatory, non-refundable,
introduced by law and intended to serve as income of the state budget for the financing of society-

wide needs.

In addition to the above, the Respondent claims that the Solar Levy is also non-equivalent.
According to the Respondent, this fact is acknowledged by the Claimant’s experts who state that
the Solar Levy is “formally indeed non-equivalent,” and that “equivalence” exists only “to a
certain extent.””*° The Respondent contends that the right to receive the FiT is independent from
the Solar Levy “due to the absence of an immediate, direct and concrete consideration in return
on the part of the public authority”.?*” Instead, the right derives from the obligation of compulsory
purchasers to purchase RES electricity at a fixed price. Indeed, solar plants installed before the
solar boom and producers of non-solar forms of RES electricity are equally entitled to the FiT,
but not liable to pay the Solar Levy.’ The relationship between the Solar Levy and the FiT is
confined to the fact that both are charged on the same product, namely electricity produced by
solar RES, at an amount which corresponds to a fixed proportion of the price received for such
electricity. Similar relations are commonly seen in relation to other taxes, such as VAT, which
amounts to a percentage of the value of goods and services the consumption of which is taxed.*”
In short, payment of the Solar Levy involves no “quid pro quo” in consideration for receiving
the FiT.70°

In addition, the budgetary expenditure subsidizing RES actually increased in 2014, whereas the
Solar Levy payable by solar generators in receipt of FiT support was reduced by Act 310/2013
Coll. from 26% to 10%, thus illustrating the lack of any correlation.**' In this vein, the

Respondent argues that the amount of the budget subsidy is not calculated by reference to the

amounts collected through the Solar Levy and that, unlike the budget subsidy, Solar Levy
revenues were a function of the quantity of electricity produced by solar RES producers. While
the Solar Levy was originally expected to offset approximately one third of the budgetary
expenditure on RES subsidies, this was merely an estimate and, ultimately, no correlation ever

existed in practice.”

Contrary to the Claimant’s argument, the Solar Levy is also not a fee. In particular, it is not paid
on a transactional basis; it is not “voluntary”; and it is not “irregular”. In any case, the
Claimant’s proposition that the Solar Levy is a fee for receiving the FiT is inconsequential, since
the distinction between taxes and fees is of very limited significance under contemporary Czech
tax law and practice, and given that fees “relate to” taxes, within the meaning of Article 21(7) of

the ECT, to the extent that a fee administered by the TAL is part of the Czech tax system.”

Moreover, the Solar Levy is not paid for a specific purpose. Leaving aside the irrelevance of
legislative reasons for this purpose and the existence of purpose-oriented taxes, as exemplified
by road taxes, the absence of a specific purpose is demonstrated by the fact that proceeds of the
Solar Levy were deposited into the general treasury account. *® Given its nature as a revenue

raising measure, which was meant to reduce excessive profits, the Solar Levy on the contrary

was a tax measure perfectly consistent with bona fide taxation purposes.”

The Respondent argues further that the Solar Levy is treated as a tax by the Czech judicial organs,
most notably by the Constitutional Court in a decision specifically examining the Solar Levy,

and the Supreme Administrative Court.” In particular relation to the decisions of the Supreme

Administrative Court, the Respondent emphasizes that the judgment of the Grand Chamber of
17 December 2013 confirmed that the Solar Levy was a tax. That is a ruling which enjoys greater
authority than, and is not affected by, those adopted by individual panels, such as the judgment
of 10 July 2014 of the Supreme Administrative Court relied upon by the Claimant. To the extent
that the latter decision held that the Solar Levy was not of a tax nature, on grounds of its non-
equivalence, this conclusion was set out in a “single-paragraph obiter statement” which, in the
opinion of the Respondent, resulted from the panel’s lack of familiarity with the mechanics of
RES support.2*
Furthermore, the Czech authorities did not argue before the Supreme Administrative Court that
the Solar Levy is not a tax and are, thus, not estopped from alleging that it is, in fact, a tax. The
Claimant’s allegation is based on an unwarranted assumption and disproved most notably by the
fact that the dictum that the Solar Levy is not a tax was rendered by the Supreme Administrative

Court sua sponte.

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s remaining indicators of the non-tax nature of the Solar
Levy are wrong. As for the submission to Parliament of draft Act 402/2010 by the Ministry of
Industry and Trade instead of the Ministry of Finance, the Respondent observes that the Ministry
of Finance and the Government as a whole were involved in the process, which led to the adoption
of the Solar Levy.?” With regard to the use of the term “levy”, the Respondent states that the use
of the term resulted from the Ministry of Finance’s practice of using different terminology for ad
hoc taxes introduced by general legislation. In any event, there are other levies in Czech
an

legislation, most of which are taxes.” As for the limited extent of the group of taxpayers, the

Respondent observes that there are taxes in the Czech system for the payment of which only

potential expropriatory effects of the Solar Levy by the Constitutional Court relates to the

constitutionality of the measure, not its tax nature. In any event, the Constitutional Court did not

find the Solar Levy to be a confiscatory tax.” As for the temporary nature of the Solar Levy, the
Respondent argues that temporary taxes have been levied in the Czech Republic in the past and
that there is no requirement that a measure be indefinite in order to qualify as a tax.?” From the
foregoing, it follows, according to the Respondent, that both the Solar Levy and the Tax Holiday,

the character as a tax of which is not in dispute, are taxes.’”°

Finally, and in response to the allegation that the Solar Levy was enacted in bad faith, the
Respondent submits that the Claimant’s allegations of impropriety are unfounded; the Solar Levy
applied to all solar producers, regardless of whether they were entitled to investment treaty
protection.°” Referring to the decision of the tribunal in Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru, the
Respondent argues that good faith must, in principle, be assumed;”” that, in any case, the Energy
Charter Secretariat 2015 publication does not suggest that taxes must be imposed in good faith;?”
and that, even if it were accepted that bad faith was involved, such conduct would only be relevant
to the merits,” but it would not affect the character as a tax of the Solar Levy under Czech
domestic law. Furthermore, the Respondent submits that no bad faith can be inferred from the
use of a mechanism, which the Claimant deems convoluted since, as observed by the tribunal in
Invesmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic, not having resort to the most obvious solution is not an

automatic indication of bad faith.**° To conclude, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal

 

decline jurisdiction in relation to the Claimant’s ECT claims.

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant challenges the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction, and in particular its

domestic law.”*!

Pointing out that what is at issue is the interpretation of a treaty provision, the Claimant argues
that the applicable rules of interpretation are contained in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, whereby
the definition of “taxation measure” set out in Article 21(7) of the ECT must be interpreted in

good faith, bearing in mind the context and the object and purpose of the ECT.”

In this connection, the Claimant argues that, as recognized by the Respondent, the VCLT is
applicable to, and plays a central role in, the interpretation of Article 21 of the ECT.7% In
particular, the Claimant contends that, since the Respondent has failed to establish that a “special
meaning” pursuant to Article 31(4) of the VCLT is to be attributed to the term “taxation
measures” in Article 21(7) of the ECT, only its “ordinary meaning” is to be taken into account.”
Furthermore, the Claimant maintains that the renvoi to domestic law does not preclude the
application of Article 31(1) of the VCLT to the interpretation of Article 21(7) of the ECT, due to

the latter’s international nature as a treaty provision.?*°

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 21(7) of the ECT,
according to which a contracting state’s mere characterization of a measure as “taxation” would
suffice to remove it from the scope of the ECT, is at odds with the ECT’s drafters’ intention, the
good faith standard, and the purpose of the ECT. In particular, relying upon the decisions in Yukos
Universal Limited v. Russia,*° RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation?’ and Quasar
de Valores v. The Russian Federation,** the Claimant argues that a good faith interpretation of
the ECT tax carve-out is called for, whereby it is confined to bona fide measures. Contracting
States are thereby prevented from an otherwise unrestricted freedom to escape their obligations
under the ECT.?® In this vein, the Claimant maintains that a determination as to the bona fide
character of a measure is crucial to establish whether it is a “taxation measure” within the

meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and, thus, of relevance not only to the merits of, but also to a

tribunal’s jurisdiction over, a dispute arising out of such a measure.”

The Claimant submits that the Solar Levy is not a bona fide taxation measure,” since it was not
introduced to raise budget revenue, as claimed by the Respondent, but was instead a deliberate
use of its power to tax to avoid international responsibility.” According to the Claimant a State’s
authority over taxation matters is not absolute and, thus, an interpretation of the tax carve-out to
the effect that reliance is to be placed exclusively upon domestic law would be contrary to the
principle of good faith and the ECT’s purpose.” Furthermore, the Claimant, contesting the
relevance of the decisions relied upon by the Respondent, argues that Article 21 of the ECT does
not permit a State to opt out of its obligations thereunder, nor does it allow a State to deny the

ECT’s protection to an investor.

The Claimant adds that the lack of good faith on the part of the Respondent is evidenced by the
rationale of, and background to, the Solar Levy; the use of taxation as a mechanism to disguise a
reduction of the amount of support accorded to solar energy producers; and the inconsistent

conduct of the Respondent following the enactment of the Solar Levy.”°

As for the abusiveness of the Respondent’s exercise of its taxation power, the Claimant submits
that this power was used to adopt a measure, which was clearly not a tax, as evidenced by
declarations of the Deputy Environmental Minister and the Minister of Industry and Trade at

meetings held by the Economic Coordination C i and the E ic Ce i of the

 

Chamber of Deputies on 15 October?’ and 2 November 2010,”” respectively. The Claimant does
not accept that an attempt to find a lawful solution to a problem is necessarily an indication of
good faith, since compliance with domestic law is not an excuse for breaches of international

obligations. Also, the Claimant does not accept that the applicability of the Solar Levy regardless

of the nationality of solar energy producers demonstrated that their ability to invoke investment

Respondent sought legal opinions concerning the risks of investment arbitration as a result of the

enactment of the Solar Levy.?°*

As for the inconsistency of the Respondent’s conduct, the Claimant refers to the 10 July 2014
decision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court, which in the context of a decision
addressing the issue of whether, in combination with the corporate income tax, the Solar Levy
would have been in breach of the prohibition of double taxation, held that the Solar Levy is not
a tax.” According to the Claimant, the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court should
preclude any further discussion in this arbitration as to the nature of the Solar Levy as a tax under

Czech law.

The Claimant contests the relevance of the rulings relied upon by the Respondent in support of
the proposition that, in accordance with Czech case law, the Solar Levy is not a tax. Instead, the
Claimant submits that: (1) the question of whether the Solar Levy is a tax was directly addressed
by the Supreme Administrative Court and not merely in an obiter portion of the decision; (2) the
judgment of the Grand Chamber of 17 December 2013, relied upon by the Respondent, only
characterized the Solar Levy as a tax, because it is administered according to the TAL; (3) the
decision of the Supreme Administrative Court of 10 July 2014 is not isolated, since several other
judgments of Czech courts, including the Constitutional Court and the Second and Fifth
Chambers of the Supreme Administrative Court have ruled that the Solar Levy is not a tax, but a

de facto reduction of the FiT."

With regard to the Respondent’s purported explanations for the implementation of the Solar Levy
instead of a direct reduction of the FiT, the Claimant advances a number of arguments. In
response to the proposition that a direct reduction of the FiT would have needed to be much

greater than 26%, the Claimant notes that this is unsupported by the facts. In fact, while during

the meeting of the Economic Committee of 2 November 2010 an increase of the Solar Levy rate
from 26% to 50% was discussed so as to avoid the imposition of a tax on emission allowances,
the question of a direct reduction of the FiT was not in issue.*” Also, the Solar Levy is not
necessarily more flexible than a reduction of the FiT, nor temporary, and, in any case, a reduction
of the FiT did not have to be permanent.*” In addition, the enactment of a direct reduction of the

FiT would not have been more cumbersome than the introduction of the Solar Levy.“

The Claimant characterizes the Solar Levy as a reduction of a promised benefit, adopted in the
form of a tax for the purpose of taking advantage of the tax carve-out under the ECT. This is
allegedly evidenced by discussions in the Czech Parliament prior to the adoption of Act No.
402/2010, most notably during a meeting of the Emergency Coordination Committee held in
October 2010," and the Respondent’s own allegation that the measure was in fact not a tax,
made in connection with a challenge to the Solar Levy before the Czech Supreme Court. The
Claimant adds that the Respondent, for this reason, is now estopped from arguing that the Solar
Levy is a bona fide tax under international law.*” For its part, the Claimant also contends that it
is not estopped from characterizing the Solar Levy as a non-tax measure, most notably since
terms used in the SPV’s financial statements are irrelevant for the purposes of determining the

nature of the Solar Levy as a tax.>°*

In addition, the Claimant further contends that the Solar Levy is not a tax under Czech law?
According to the Claimant, Article 11(5) of the Charter and Section 2(3) of the TAL are irrelevant
for the determination of the nature of the Solar Levy, since (1) both provisions and related
accounting and budgetary regulations do not distinguish between taxes and fees; (2) Article 2(3)
of the TAL contains no general definition of tax, which is absent in the Czech legal system; and

(3) in any case, the Czech legislator knowingly employed the label “levy” instead of “tax”.3!°

Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the Solar Levy does not possess the six features of a tax,
namely, that it is: (1) obligatory, (2) non-refundable, (3) non-equivalent, (4) introduced by law,
(5) intended to serve as income, and (6) paid for no specific purpose.*"’ In light of these features,

the Claimant puts forward a number of specific arguments, as broadly summarized below.

First, the Solar Levy was enacted and “earmarked” for a specific purpose, namely to offset the
costs incurred by the Respondent in connection with the support it had undertaken to provide to
solar energy producers without formally reducing the level of tariffs guaranteed to them.>”” This
purpose is clearly indicated by the parliamentary discussions leading to the introduction of Act
No. 402/2010. Therefore, the Solar Levy lacks one typical feature of all taxes, according to

academic theory.*!3

In this vein, the Claimant argues that the legislative reasons for implementing the Solar Levy are
“irrelevant for the purposes of the ‘specific purpose’ inquiry”. Instead, the Tribunal should focus
on the “purpose for which the funds are actually allocated”.*!* The Claimant argues further that

the existence of a specific purpose is a mandatory feature of taxes; that the Solar Levy is a de

facto reduction of the FiT and not a revenue-raising measure and therefore does not meet the

bona fide test as articulated by the Yukos tribunal; and that reliance on the fact that the Solar Levy
is collected in a separate account, not administered by the same Ministry in charge of budgetary
contributions to the FiT, entails a formalistic distinction and is irrelevant since the cash flows of

the Solar Levy and the RES support subsidy are connected through the State budget.*!*

Second, the Claimant argues that the Solar Levy does not meet the non-equivalence requirement,
which is a mandatory requirement of all taxes. This entails that no consideration on the part of
the State for the payment of a tax must be involved, as acknowledged by all four party experts.*!°
According to the Claimant, there was a direct link, or a “guid pro quo”, between the Solar Levy
and the payment of FiT and Green Bonuses.*”” This conclusion finds support in the decision of

the Czech Supreme Administrative Court of 10 July 2014, which held that the Solar Levy was

not a tax, but a de facto reduction of the FiT and Green Bonuses.*!* The decision, in the
Claimant’s submission, is thorough and highly authoritative, therefore dealing a fatal blow to the
Respondent’s argument.*"” In particular, the decision lends further support to the fundamental
character of non-equivalence as a feature of all taxes, and also confirms that the Solar Levy fails

to meet the non-equivalence standard, a conclusion shared by Messrs. Borkovec and Fryzek.*””

With respect to certain decisions of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court and the
Constitutional Court relied upon by the Respondent,™! the Claimant contends that only the
decision of 10 July 2014 actually analysed the Solar Levy, and that the references to the Solar
Levy as a “tax” in the other decisions are either vague or confined to the character as a tax for
the purposes of the TAL. In any event, these decisions were without prejudice to the finding of
the Grand Chamber of the Supreme Administrative Court which held that, while being a “tax”
within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the TAL, the Solar Levy resulted in a de facto decrease of

the level of support to solar energy producers.”

The Claimant further contends that the Respondent is estopped from claiming in these
proceedings that the Solar Levy is not linked to the FiT, given certain statements of the Czech
Ministry of Finance before the Constitutional Court. In this regard, the Claimant contends that
the Respondent’s view that the only link between the FiT and the Solar Levy is that “the former
is the taxable base of the latter”*™ is disproved by the referenced statements of the Minister of
Finance, to the effect that income from the Solar Levy “serves to compensate the additional
expenses associated with the obligation to purchase electricity from solar radiation” and that the

FiT and the Solar Levy “are inherently tied together, since they are connected through the fiscal

aspects.”°°5

Third, five further indicators of the non-tax nature of the Solar Levy exist:**° (1) the enactment
of Act No. 402/2010 differed from the usual legislative process, as the bill was submitted to
Parliament by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, unlike most taxation measures which are
presented by the Ministry of Finance;*’ (2) the Solar Levy applies to “a narrow group of
taxpayers”, composed of solar energy producers identified on the basis of their date of connection
to the grid, a non-tax criterion applied at the discretion of grid operators;*** (3) the Solar Levy
was temporary, which further demonstrates the non-tax nature of the Solar Levy,*” (4) the term
“levy” was employed, instead of “tax”, without explanation;**° and (5) the Solar Levy was not
proportional, as it may have “strangling” or “liquidating” effects according to the Czech
Constitutional Court.**! In addition, the possession of features present in other types of payments,
such as certain “fees”, does not render the Solar Levy a tax, nor do accounting, budgetary and

statistics rules whereby the Solar Levy is treated as a tax.>*?

The Claimant submits that the definition of tax set out in the decisions in EnCana Corporation
v. Republic of Ecuador, Duke Energy Electroquil Partners & Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of
Ecuador, and Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador, each brought against Ecuador
under different U.S. and Canadian treaties, is not applicable to the Solar Levy, since the tax carve-
outs involved in those treaties did not define “tax” or “taxation measure”, unlike the ECT

the Solar Levy, despite having been introduced by law, does not meet the other requirements of
that definition, since it is unclear that the narrow group of taxpayers amounts to a “class of
persons”, no payment was made to the State, which merely acted as collecting agent but did not

retain any funds, and no public purpose existed.“

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

Preliminarily, the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ disagreement regarding the ECT’s tax carve-
out is limited to the question whether the Solar Levy constitutes a “Taxation Measure” within the
meaning of Article 21 of the ECT and, as such, is excluded from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under
the ECT. As the Respondent contends, the Claimant “does not deny that the Tax Incentives
provided for by the Act on Income Tax are ‘taxation measures’ covered by the carve-out,” and
that “Claimant’s only disagreement with the Czech Republic’s analysis relates to the

characterization — for purposes of the ECT — of the Acts that introduced and extended the Solar

Levy as “Taxation Measures,”*** a proposition that the Respondent repeated at the Hearing**’

and that the Claimant did not challenge at any time.

As a consequence, the Tribunal has little doubt that the Income Tax measures and the Shortened
Depreciation fall within the ECT’s tax carve-out. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts that it lacks
jurisdiction to hear Claimant’s claims regarding those two measures under the ECT. The
Tribunal’s analysis is therefore limited to the question whether it has jurisdiction under the ECT

over the Claimant’s claims related to the Solar Levy.

The Tribunal’s analysis begins with the burden of proof. The “Taxation” provision of the ECT
relied upon by the Respondent is an exception to the more general provisions of the ECT. As
such, it is clear that the Respondent bears the burden of proof of establishing that the Solar Levy
may be characterized as a “provision relating to taxes of the domestic law” within the meaning

of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT.

This allocation of the burden of proof is consistent with the text of Article 21 of the ECT, which
provides in relevant part: “Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty
shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting

Parties.” It is also consistent with the character of Taxation Measures as an exception to the more

Hearing Transcript (27 February 2017), 241:11-15 (“You heard the Claimants accept that two of them, the
repeal of the income tax holiday and the depreciation changes, are in fact taxation measures. So that leaves
us really with the only issue of whether the solar levy is also a taxation measure.”).

general terms of the ECT. The Respondent indeed does not dispute that it bears the burden of

proof that the Solar Levy constitutes a “tax” or “Taxation Measure” within the meaning of Article
21.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent has not discharged this burden of proof. As discussed
below, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Solar Levy constitutes a “tax” as a matter of Czech
law, as principally contended by the Respondent. Likewise, even apart from Czech law, the
Tribunal is not persuaded that the Solar Levy may be characterized as a tax or Taxation Measure
within the meaning of Article 21 of the ECT. As a consequence, the Tribunal concludes that it
does not lack jurisdiction over the Claimant’s claims related to the Solar Levy under the ECT on

this ground.

First, the Respondent’s primary contention is that the Tribunal “must look to the domestic law of
the Czech Republic”” in determining whether the Solar Levy is a tax within the meaning of
Article 21 of the ECT. The Tribunal is satisfied that the application of the ECT’s tax carve-out is
conditional on the State invoking the Article 21 exception, characterizing the putative “Taxation

Measure” as a tax in nature and substance as a matter of its domestic law.

It is undisputed, and the Tribunal agrees, that Article 21 must be interpreted in accordance with
the standards set out by the VCLT, particularly in its Article 31, and international law
generally. This requires that effect be given to Article 21(7)’s renvoi to the domestic law of
the Contracting Party invoking Article 21. Indeed, Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT refers expressly
to a “provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party” (emphasis added).
The Tribunal shares the Respondent’s view that this “means necessarily that the relevant

assessment must be made under the domestic law of the respondent State.”**°

This interpretation is consistent with the text of Article 21(7). It is, in the Tribunal’s view, also
consistent with Article 21’s objective to permit, within the limits of the provision, Contracting
Parties to carve-out measures from certain ECT standards — that is to “exclude a taxation measure
from the coverage of the standards of protection.”™"° Critically, however, unless a Contracting
State has itself chosen to characterize a measure as a tax measure in its own domestic legal order,

that measure does not fall within the scope of Article 21 of the ECT. In short, Article 21 applies,

prima facie, only to those measures which constitute taxation measures within the legal order of
the State invoking the Article 21 exception. (As discussed below, there are also international
limits imposed by Article 21 on those measures which a Contracting State may define as tax

measures as a matter of its domestic law, but this is a separate and subsequent issue.)

Applying this analysis, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent has discharged its
burden of proving that the Solar Levy was a tax as a matter of domestic Czech law. Rather, the
expert evidence and other materials before the Tribunal indicate that the Solar Levy was regarded
as a tax as a matter of Czech law only for certain limited purposes, but as something other than a
tax for other, more significant, purposes. In the Tribunal’s view, this is insufficient to justify a
conclusion that the Solar Levy was characterized by Czech law as a tax within the meaning of
Article 21 of the ECT.

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that the Solar Levy was titled just that — the “Solar
Levy” — not the “Solar Tax” or the like. Where the inquiry is whether a measure is characterized
as a tax or taxation measure under Czech law, it is of some significance that the measure was, in
contrast to many other fiscal measures in the Czech Republic, not denominated by the Czech
legislature as a tax. If this were the only consideration militating against characterization of the
Solar Levy as a tax under Czech law, the Tribunal would be reluctant to attach dispositive weight
to it. However, as discussed below, there are other, more substantial, considerations that point

against characterization of the measure as a tax under Czech law.

Most importantly, the Tribunal notes that the 10 July 2014 decision of the Czech Supreme
Administrative Court held that, for double taxation purposes, the Solar Levy is not a tax under
Czech law. The Court addressed the question whether, combined with the corporate income tax,
the Solar Levy would have entailed an unlawful double taxation, and rejected that conclusion,
holding that the Solar Levy was not a tax, but rather “in nature” a reduction of the government
subsidy (FiT and Green Bonuses).*#' The Supreme Administrative Court reasoned that “[tJhe
subject of the [Solar Levy] is the amount resulting from the consideration of stipulating the

9342

amount of government support for this type of economic activity,””~ which led it to conclude
that the Solar Levy lacked the essential feature of “non-equivalence,” which in its view was

necessary for categorization of the measure as a “tax” under Czech law. “4?

There is no dispute that the Czech Supreme Administrative Court was the Czech Republic’s
highest judicial authority on the (non-constitutional) questions it addressed regarding the nature
of the Solar Levy. In its 10 July 2014 decision, the Court specifically addressed the nature and
substance of the Solar Levy. The Tribunal has little doubt that this characterization was not an
obiter statement, but a necessary element in the Court’s holding.“ The Tribunal also notes that
other judgments of Czech courts, including the Constitutional Court and Chambers of the
Supreme Administrative Court have likewise found the Solar Levy to be, in essence, a reduction

of the FiT, not a tax.*45

Given the foregoing authorities, the Tribunal would be very reluctant to adopt a different
conclusion as to the nature and substance of the Solar Levy under Czech law. In particular, the
Tribunal is not persuaded by the argument that the Czech legal system does not assign judicial
decisions (or decisions by courts other than the Constitutional Court) erga omnes effect or
recognise them as sources of law. *° That is not uncommon in civil law jurisdictions. More
importantly, as the Respondent’s expert conceded at the Hearing, the formal status and effect is
in no way indicative of the interpretative authority that Supreme Administrative Court judgments
have in the Czech domestic legal system: “Although the decisions of the Supreme Administrative
Court are not considered a formal source of law in the Czech Republic, as a civil law country
which does not have the system of court precedents, an established and long-term adjudicator,
which means case law, is usually considered to be an interpretative guide which may have a

relatively high level of authority.”**”

The Tribunal considers that for the characterization of the Solar Levy in the Czech legal order,

Czech judicial decisions, including those of the Supreme Administrative Court, offer the best

available guidance, and it therefore attaches particular weight to them.

The Tribunal draws further comfort in reaching this conclusion from the fact that the Respondent

The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s argument that the Supreme Administrative Court’s decision
came in a “single-paragraph obiter statement.” On the contrary, as Respondent’s expert acknowledged in
cross-examination, this element of the Court’s decision was both necessary to its holding and was
elaborated upon in several points in the Court’s judgment (Hearing Transcript (1 March 2017), 163:22-

itself contended, through its Ministry of Finance, that the Solar Levy was not a tax in proceedings
before the Czech courts. In particular, the Czech Finance Ministry argued before the Czech
Constitutional Court that the Solar Levy was “aimed to decrease the economic feed-in tariffs” **
and that “from the material perspective, the introduced measures [including the Solar Levy] are
considered a reduction of subsidy”*”’ In the Tribunal’s view, these characterizations are entirely
consistent with the Supreme Administrative Court’s 10 July 2014 decision that the Solar Levy

was a de facto reduction of the FiTs, rather than a tax.

The Tribunal is not convinced that it should attach comparable weight to the various decisions
on which the Respondent relies to argue that the Solar Levy was a tax under Czech law. These
judicial decisions focus on determining whether or not the Solar Levy is governed by the
procedural and administrative provisions of the TAL and that it complies with the requirements
of Article 11(5) of the Charter.** It is undisputed that the TAL’s definition of “tax” applies to a
broad variety of public charges, including administrative fees, fines and other charges which are

not commonly considered taxes under Czech law.**! It is also undisputed that Article 11(5) of

352

the Charter is applicable not only to taxes, but also to fees.” In light of the foregoing, in the

Tribunal’s view, these authorities only demonstrate that the Solar Levy was established in
compliance with the Charter’s legal constraints and administered in accordance with the TAL’s
procedural requirements, applicable to both taxes and other fees. In the Tribunal’s view, these
conclusions are certainly not dispositive of the proper characterization of the Solar Levy and they

do not diminish the persuasiveness of the Supreme Administrative Court’s 10 July 2014 decision

in the present case.

The Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Solar Levy does not constitute a tax under Czech
law primarily on the basis of the Czech judicial decisions addressing its characterization. The
Tribunal shares the Respondent’s view that, in these particular circumstances, “[a]cademic
literature [...] cannot be determinative as to whether a particular measure is legally a tax.” The
academic literature which addresses the nature and substance of the Solar Levy under Czech Law
and which is relied on by the Parties fails to engage with a number of the above referenced judicial
decisions. *™ In these circumstances, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it should attach decisive
weight to any of the academic commentary in the record, or that any of this commentary displaces

the Supreme Administrative Court’s characterization of the Solar Levy.

In summary, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the Respondent has discharged its burden of
proving that the Solar Levy was characterized as a tax under Czech law. In its view, the weight
of the evidence is that the Solar Levy was regarded as something other than a tax and was not
supportive of a conclusion that it was a measure to which the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT

is applicable.

Second, and independently, the Tribunal is also not persuaded that the Solar Levy is a tax or

taxation measure within the limits contemplated by Article 21 of the ECT.

As discussed above, Article 21 excludes specified tax measures from the scope of the ECT, but
only in so far as that measure is characterized as a tax measure under the domestic law of the
State invoking the ECT’s tax carve-out. Unless a measure is regarded as a tax measure by the
State which has enacted it, and which relies upon it under Article 21, neither the text nor object

and purpose of Article 21 are satisfied.

In addition, however, the Tribunal also concludes that a measure characterized as a taxation
measure by a Contracting Party will only be excluded from the scope of the ECT, if it falls within
the limits of legitimate regulatory measures provided by Article 21 of the ECT itself (as well as

customary international law).**

In this regard, Article 21 imposes implicit limits on those
measures which may be invoked by a Contracting Party under the ECT’s tax carve-out.

Accepting the existence of international limits on the Contracting Parties’ right to exclude

taxation measures from certain provisions of the ECT does not strip the Contracting Parties from
one of their “most quintessential sovereign powers.” *** Instead, it acknowledges that any
sovereign prerogative has its limits, which are, in the present case, imposed by the text and
purposes of Article 21 of the ECT. The Contracting Parties are, of course, free to make use of
their regulatory power and adopt measures in fiscal matters. They are, however, limited in their

right to invoke such measures under the ECT.

A contrary conclusion, that is, finding that the definition of tax measures in Article 21 of the ECT
was not subject to any inherent limits, would empower Contracting Parties to define unilaterally
which measures fall within the ECT’s protective scope. The Tribunal does not consider that the
drafters of Article 21 intended such a result. Moreover, this would contravene the object and
purpose of the ECT, which is to establish uniform standards among the Contracting Parties. This
is an aim to which Article 21 is clearly intended to be an exception, since its scope is specifically
limited to tax measures. The Tribunal is persuaded that Article 21 imposes international limits

on what may constitute a tax measure for these purposes.

Article 21’s limits are necessarily implied as the provision itself does not set out an explicit
international definition of “Taxation measures.” There is, however, no need for the Tribunal to
provide a comprehensive definition. It suffices for the Tribunal to address the facets of Article

21’s limits, which it considers relevant in the present case.

In the Tribunal’s view, Article 21 was not intended to exclude from the ECT’s scope measures
the main objective of which was other than that of the raising of general revenue for the State,**”
and which were formulated and structured as taxation measures for a particular ulterior reason

(such as, here, reducing the risk of legal challenges).

Although not dependent upon a finding of bad faith, this conclusion is consistent with the
principle that treaty obligations must be interpreted, and performed, in good faith.*** The Tribunal
shares the view that: “The principle of good faith has long been recognized in public international

law, as it is also in all national legal systems. This principle requires parties ‘to deal honestly and

fairly with each other, to represent their motives and purposes truthfully, and to refrain from
taking unfair advantage ...’ Nobody shall abuse the rights granted by treaties, and more generally,

every rule of law includes an implied clause that it should not be abused.”**?

The Tribunal considers these principles particularly significant under the ECT. The purpose of
the ECT was to “promote long-term cooperation in the energy field”* and the treaty was
designed to promote transparency, fairness and stability. These considerations underscore the
importance of good faith in the application of Article 21 to a Contracting Party’s regulatory

measures.

In light of these principles, the Tribunal takes the view that the Solar Levy falls outside the scope
of Article 21 of the ECT. The Tribunal attaches particular weight to statements made at the time
of the enactment of the Solar Levy, which clearly evidence that the Solar Levy’s main objective
was to reduce FiTs payable to certain solar energy producers, and not the general raising of state
revenue. Importantly, these statements also evidence that the Solar Levy was structured, in many
respects, as a tax for a particular reason, namely to avoid claims against the Czech Republic under

the ECT. By way of example:

(a) 23 September 2010 Emergency Coordination Committee: “More stringent measures
that would put the support of RES, and especially PVPP to an end” gave rise to a “risk
of arbitration”; Committee charged with deciding “whether legal analysis of potential
arbitrations with the assessment of risks and costs for the state budget if the proposal
for more stringent measures is passed, e.g., by adopting the change in the feed-in tariff
for RES.”*°!

(b) 15 October 2010 Emergency Coordination Committee: “Deputy Environmental
Minister Bizkova stated that it is necessary to find a formally correct mechanism for
reduction of the support of RES from photovoltaic power plants, such that it cannot be

legally contested.”°

electricity consumers in the Czech Republic. This method — through the withholding
tax —is not just a retroactive correction of support. One may argue as to whether or not
this is retroactive. Nonetheless, it is a similar situation as if you changed the conditions
for investors by increasing the income tax. From the arbitration perspective, they will
strive to advocate the principle on which the support for RES has been based, i-e., their
15-year payback period [...] the rest is the question of tax regimes — this is the
responsibility of each country, and changes in tax rates should not be challenged in

arbitrations.”*

(d) 29 November 2010 Senate Session: “I would like to say that, explicitly, when it comes

(f) Chairman of ERO: “it would be appropriate to reduce the FiT for photovoltaic power

plants [...] much more but ERO was not allowed to do so.”*”

The Tribunal accepts that one purpose of the Solar Levy was to raise revenue for the State (to
finance the subsidies to solar energy producers).*** Most importantly, however, the Solar Levy
was structured to adjust the level of the FiT payable to certain renewable energy producers rather
than to raise revenue. This is evidenced, in the Tribunal’s view, by the unusually narrow class of
persons subject to the Solar Levy; the method of calculating the Solar Levy; and the possibility
that the Solar levy could not only be paid quarterly by the solar energy producers, but could also

be withheld from the FiTs paid to those producers.

Despite this, the Solar Levy was structured, in a number of respects, to resemble a tax; as the
Respondent correctly observes, the Solar Levy did not formally reduce the FiT, was imposed
(like many taxes) on a specified base with specified rates and was collected pursuant to the TAL.
In the Tribunal’s view, however, the main reason for these characteristics, as evidenced by the
statements quoted above, was an effort to bring the Solar Levy within the scope of Article 21 and

thereby avoid the restrictions of the ECT.

The Tribunal again notes the 10 July 2014 decision of the Czech Supreme Administrative Court,
and the submissions of the Czech Ministry of Finance to the Czech Constitutional Court,
concluding that the Solar Levy was a de facto reduction of the FiTs payable to certain renewable

energy producers. In the Tribunal’s view, the Supreme Administrative Court’s analysis is

 

persuasive: for the reasons outlined above, the main focus of the Solar Levy was the reduction of
certain FiTs, as evidenced by both the measure’s structure and the parliamentary statements made

in connection with its enactment.

The Tribunal emphasizes that this case does not involve conduct comparable to that in
RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. The Russian Federation, and Quasar de Valores v. The Russian
Federation. There is no suggestion that the Respondent used its tax authority to target political
opponents, to seize control of major economic enterprises or to accomplish objectives unrelated
to fiscal and budgetary issues. The Respondent’s conduct here is simply not of the same character,

and it did not act abusively, duplicitously or with similar bad faith.

Having said this, as discussed above, the nature and objectives of the Solar Levy are such that it
does not fall within the definition of a tax measure under Article 21. As its structure and
legislative history make clear, the Solar Levy was not designed primarily to raise revenue, but
instead to reduce the FiTs for a specific set of renewable energy producers, with the Solar Levy
being structured, in many respects, as a tax in an attempt to reduce the risk of legal challenges.
This was not the purpose of the ECT. If the Solar Levy were to be exempted from the scope of

the ECT, the treaty’s object and purposes would be materially frustrated.

THE CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE ECT
1. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the Claimant cannot bring a claim for the entirety of SolarOne’s

shares since, in November 2009, prior to the adoption of the contested measures, a 10% stake

342.

343.

Page 96 of 204

had been transferred to Mr. Chroustovsky.* The Respondent contends that the Claimant, which

characterises its claims as relating to damages suffered by its own investment inclusive of a 10%

call option in SolarOne (the “Call Option”), cannot bring a claim in respect of the 10% SolarOne
stake held by Mr. Chroustovsky.>”°

The Respondent submits that the Call Option is not an investment under the ECT; it does not
qualify as a “form of equity participation” as set out in Article 1(6) of the ECT, because it does
not involve actual ownership but only creates a right to potential ownership, as the Claimant itself
acknowledges.*”' The Call Option neither involves a contribution nor risk, since the purpose of a
call option is precisely to eliminate risk as to return on investment.*” In addition, referring to the
decision in Yukos, among others, the Respondent submits that even if it were accepted that a call
option is an investment, the Call Option is merely a contingent right, since no transfer of
ownership resulted from the November 2009 transfer agreement, relied upon by the Claimant.”
The Respondent also argues that an abuse of process would take place, through exercise of the
Call Option after the dispute arose, if the Tribunal were to exercise jurisdiction over the 10%
stake in SolarOne.*”

As for the Claimant’s remaining 90% stake in SolarOne (the “90% stake”), which encompasses
half of the damages claimed in this arbitration, the Respondent argues that, on the assumption
that a protected investment was made, no obligation would have been owed continuously to date
to the Claimant under the ECT.*”> Since the Claimant’s shares were transferred to Mr. Jan Cerny,
a Czech national and one of the Claimant’s shareholders, on 25 May 2016, claims in connection

with any injury to SolarOne resulting from breaches allegedly committed after that date fall

 

outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Thus, the Tribunal jurisdiction is confined to claims for injury

suffered by the Claimant, if any, while it owned SolarOne.>”°

2. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant states that it is asserting claims in respect of damages suffered by its own
investment in the form of a Call Option, and thus, contrary to the Respondent’s contention, not
on behalf of Mr. Chroustovsky.>””

The Claimant submits that the Call Option is a protected investment under the ECT. This follows
not only from the text of the ECT, but additionally in light of the fact that the Call Option exhibits
the features which the Respondent attributes to an investment, such as economic value and the
assumption of risk. No abuse of process would be involved, since the Call Option had been

acquired even before the dispute became foreseeable.>”*

The Claimant further submits that its claim is not confined to the shares owned at the time of
adoption of the challenged measures since, pursuant to the plain language of Article 1(6) of the
ECT, the Call Option is a protected investment, regardless of the fact that the option concerns
shares that the Claimant “may eventually come to own”.'” The Claimant argues that the Call
Option involved neither uncertainty as to its exercise nor a contractual performance contingent
on the mere will of the Claimant.** The Claimant further contends that the exercise of the Call

Option was not barred by the prohibition on “company chains”, abrogated on 1 January 2014.8!

As for the remaining 90% interest in SolarOne, the Claimant argues that, as of 1 January 2011
(the valuation date), it is undisputed that it had a protected investment which was breached upon
implementation of the challenged measures.According to the Claimant, the 25 May 2016 sale
does not impinge on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the 90% stake, nor preclude the Claimant’s
entitlement to damages arising out of the breach, which encompasses the effects of the measures

thereafter, including both “by” and “after” the date of the award.**”

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal’s decision regarding this aspect of the controversy is divided into two parts,
concerning the Call Option, on the one hand, and the remaining 90% stake in SolarOne, on the

other hand.
Regarding the Call Option

The Parties are divided as to the character of the Call Option as an investment. Given the analysis
earlier in this Award, the Tribunal need only make a finding as to the character of the Call Option
as an investment pursuant to Article 1(6) of the ECT, having decided that it lacks jurisdiction to

consider the Claimant’s claims under the BIT.

As an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that call options are not included among the classes of
investment expressly enumerated in Article 1(6) of the ECT. The Tribunal, therefore, has to
determine whether the Call Option constitutes a “kind of asset”, for the purposes of the chapeau

to Article 1(6) of the ECT.

Article 1(6) of the ECT does not provide a definition of “asset”. Taking into account the text of
the remainder of Article 1(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal further notes that the classes of investments
enumerated in the provision comprise, among others, several kinds of rights, including rights
whereby a person is entitled to participate in a company or business, including in the form of
equity participation. According to the second paragraph of Article 1(6) of the ECT, the form of
an asset does not affect its character as an investment. Thus, the main attribute applicable to any
asset not expressly enumerated and described in the text is that it shall have been invested,
regardless of the form of such investment. From the above, the Tribunal concludes that an “asset”
comprises any right invested by an investor, regardless of the form of the investment and any

changes thereto.

Therefore, the Tribunal considers it apt to determine, first, whether a call option is an asset. In
this regard, the conclusions of the tribunal in Yukos in relation to call options are of assistance.**?
The Yukos tribunal concluded that the call options at issue did not bear upon its determination
regarding ownership of, and control over, the shares in question.*™ In particular, “[nJo transfer
of property will have occurred unless and until the option is exercised, but until it is (and it may

never be) all property remains with the grantor of the option”*** The Tribunal agrees with this

broad observation. A call option is a right which, unless exercised, has no bearing upon the matter
of ownership of another right, including a right constitutive of an asset within the meaning of
Article 1(6) of the ECT. Importantly, a call option is ancillary in character: its object is not the
making of an investment. Rather it is the asset actually invested (i.e,. the subject of the call

option) that is the principal right constitutive of an investment under Article 1(6) of the ECT.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Call Option is not an asset invested by

the Claimant and, thus, falls outside the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
Regarding the 90% stake in SolarOne

The Tribunal now turns to the Parties’ difference regarding damages allegedly caused to the

Claimant’s 90% stake in SolarOne.

The Respondent contests the character of the 90% stake as a protected investment after 25 May
2016 when the Claimant's shares were transferred to Mr. Jan Cerny. In particular, the Respondent
contests the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over any alleged damage to the 90% stake caused on or after
25 May 2016, since following the transfer of the 90% stake on this date, so it is said, no obligation
was owed anymore to the Claimant under the ECT. The Tribunal observes that, notwithstanding
its contention as to the abscence of any protected investment, the Respondent accepts that the
Tribunal has jurisdiction over measures (if any) that caused injury to the Claimant’s 90% stake
on or prior to 25 May 2016. The Claimant argues that its 90% stake does constitute a protected
investment; that a breach took place as of the date of valuation, namely | January 2011; and that
the alleged breach has a continuing effect beyond 25 May 2016, including any damages which

might be suffered by, or after, the date of issuance of this Tribunal’s award.

As for its jurisdiction ratione materiae, the Tribunal recalls its observations regarding
Article 1(6) of the ECT. As pointed out above, its finding in relation to the 90% stake has to be
based exclusively on the ECT, having decided that it lacks jurisdiction to consider the Claimant’s

claims under the BIT.

Pursuant to Article 1(6) of the ECT, the Tribunal is of the view that the 90% stake does constitute
a protected investment under the ECT. In particular, as opposed to the ancillary nature of call
options, the 90% stake is an asset constitutive of the principal right owned by the Claimant as a
protected investor under the ECT. The Tribunal, thus, has jurisdiction ratione materiae over the
90% stake.

As for its jurisdiction ratione temporis, the Tribunal addresses the Parties’ arguments relating to

injury allegedly suffered before and on or after 25 May 2016.

359,

360.

362.

363.

PCA Case No. 2014-19

Award

Page 100 of 204

For the avoidance of doubt, there is no dispute that claims concerning any measures allegedly

committed by the Claimant prior to 25 May 2016 fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

With respect to claims for injury allegedly caused to the 90% stake on or after 25 May 2016, the
Tribunal notes that, as held by the tribunal in Jmpregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan, it
is necessary to distinguish between “jurisdiction ratione temporis [...] and the applicability
ratione temporis of the substantive obligations contained” in the respective investment treaty.**°
In light of this distinction, and on a proper analysis, the Tribunal considers that what is at issue
is not the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis, but the applicability of relevant substantive
obligations under the ECT. Furthermore, the Tribunal considers that questions as to jurisdiction
are to be distinguished from those relating to the merits of the dispute, including the character of
a breach as continuing, and the applicability and content of treaty provisions setting out

obligations allegedly breached.

The Respondent does not contest the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the basis of the 25 May 2016
transfer of the 90% stake. The Tribunal considers that, to the extent that the 90% stake was owned
by the Claimant, both at the time of the alleged measures forming the basis of the claims and at
the time of commencement of the present proceedings on 22 April 2014, the Tribunal has
jurisdiction ratione temporis over any alleged injury suffered on or after 25 May 2016. The real
question which divides the Parties is how the Tribunal should deal with the injury allegedly
caused after the transfer of the 90% stake. For the Tribunal, its jurisdiction on the matter is
without prejudice to its determinations as to the applicability and content of substantive

provisions of the ECT.

To conclude, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the 90% stake, without prejudice to its
determinations as to the applicability and content of treaty provisions setting out obligations owed

to the Claimant in relation to injury allegedly caused to the Claimant on or after 25 May 2016.

WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION IN A DISPUTE BETWEEN EU INVESTORS AND
EU MEMBER STATES

On 6 March 2018, the Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“ECJ” or
“CJEU”) rendered its judgment in Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV.**’ In the operative part of the
judgment, the ECJ ruled that:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the
Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which
an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning
investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State
before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to
accept."

Article 267 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) provides:

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary
rulings concerning:
(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;
(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or
agencies of the Union;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal ofa Member State, that court
or tribunal may, if it considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to
give judgment, request the Court to give a ruling thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a
Member State against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law,
that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the Court.

If such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State
with regard to a person in custody, the Court of Justice of the European Union shall act
with the minimum of delay.

Article 344 of the TFEU reads:

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for
therein,

The Parties disagree on the impact of the Achmea judgment on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The
Respondent argues that the Tribunal “has no jurisdiction to hear the captioned matters because
the [Respondent’s] consent to arbitration under the relevant treaties is ineffective under
applicable EU law, as conclusively determined in the Achmea Judgment.”*” The Claimant

contends that “the Achmea judgment does not affect [the Tribunal’s] jurisdiction.”*°°

In particular, the Tribunal invited submissions from the Parties on the following issues:
1. Whether the Achmea judgment is dependent on the specific wording of the BIT that

was at issue in the case before the ECJ and how it relates to the BITs at issue in the
present proceedings;

The Tribunal notes that the aforementioned questions were put to the Parties in each of the four
coordinated arbitrations in PCA Case Nos. 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-20 and 2014-22, independent
of whether the Tribunal found jurisdiction under the BIT in each respective case. Although not
all of the Parties’ submissions may be equally relevant in a case where the Tribunal declines
jurisdiction under the BIT for other reasons, the Tribunal has decided for purposes of consistency

to set out summaries of the Parties’ answers to all questions below.

1. Whether the Achmea judgment is dependent on the specific wording of the BIT that
was at issue in the case before the ECJ and how it relates to the BITs at issue in the
present proceedings

(a) The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, the Achmea judgment is not limited to the specific wording of

Article 8 of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republi lands BIT (“CSFR: land:

 

 

BIT”) at issue before the ECJ, but extends to similar provisions in other investment treaties,
including the ECT.**' This is because the question answered by the ECJ in Achmea “was worded
to cover, in a general manner, investor-State provisions ‘in a bilateral investment protection

agreement between Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT).””°°

In addition, the Respondent notes that the wording of Achmea applies to “(i) ‘any provision in an

international agreement’ (ii) ‘concluded between EU Member States’ (iii) ‘under which an
investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments
in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral
tribunal.”*°> As Article 26 of the ECT fulfils these criteria, the Achmea judgment is also

applicable to this case.

 

In the ’s submission, the “provisions at issue in this p ing also are squarely
captured by the ECJ’s underlying ratio decidendi” in Achmea.™ Specifically, the Respondent
takes the view that the need to protect the effectiveness of EU law by disallowing “any
‘outsourcing’ to non-EU judicial fora of disputes that are capable of pertaining — even potentially
— to regulatory and legislative powers of the EU and its Member States in matters coming within
the scope of EU law” applies to any arbitration clauses similar to Article 8 of the CSFR-
Netherlands BIT. *°° Such clauses undermine the autonomy of EU law, because (1) the disputes
which the tribunal in question is called on to resolve “are liable to relate to the interpretation or
application of EU law”; (2) the tribunal is not “situated within the judicial system of the EU,”
and, in particular, cannot “be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the
meaning of Article 267 TFEU”; and (3) an award made by such a tribunal is not “subject to
review by a court of a Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal
may have to address can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary
ruling.”5°°

The Respondent thus argues that Article 26 of the ECT is equally incompatible with EU law as
it may also require the Tribunal to interpret or apply EU law in resolving the dispute.*”’ The
Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that EU law would not be relevant to the present
dispute, because the treaty does not contain an express choice of law provision. ** The
Respondent highlights that the treaty is not a “self-contained legal framework, isolated from

19399

international and domestic law” and that the Tribunal has to decide the dispute on the basis of

all relevant rules of international law, including the TFEU.*”

In addition, the Tribunal is not “a court or tribunal of a Member State” and as a result cannot
refer a question concerning the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ.“°' The Tribunal’s award will
be final and sufficient judicial remedies against a potential breach of EU law will not be
available.“ This is especially true in this proceeding, which is seated in Switzerland and,

therefore, outside the EU.“

According to the Respondent, the aptness of a broad reading of the Achmea judgment is

confirmed in the Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet and in the academic literature. “*

The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s argument that this Tribunal should disregard the
ECJ’s treaty interpretation in Achmea in favour of an interpretation that is in line with
international law principles of treaty interpretation and rely on “better reasoned” “” parts of the
Opinion of the Advocate General Wathelet.*°°

The Respondent concludes that the Achmea judgment “is not dependent on the specific wording
of the CSFR-Netherlands BIT [and] applies with equal force” to this arbitration,*”’ and that “there

can be no doubt that the BIT’s dispute resolution clause [is] in conflict with the TFEU.“"*

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant summarizes its position as follows:

The Achmea judgment concerned a BIT, the CSFR-Netherlands BIT, under which EU
law was applicable law pursuant to its choice-of-law clause. Unlike that BIT, the BITs

invoked by the Claimants do not contain any such clause.”
For the Claimant, the Achmea judgment only applies to instances in which a tribunal may have

to decide on substantive issues of EU law. In contrast, in the present dispute, EU law is not part

of the applicable law. Therefore, an interpretation of EU law by the Tribunal “cannot have the

 

effect of ip ising the effectiveness of EU law”, especiall i that the Tribunal is

seated outside of the EU. *°

The Claimant stresses that the present dispute cannot be decided on the basis of EU law. Since
the ECT “dofes] not refer to it, either directly or indirectly”, EU law does not qualify as
“customary international law and general principles of law” forming the lex generalis of the
dispute. *!' For the Claimant, EU law is only relevant in the present dispute as a rule of
interpretation under Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT.‘” The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s
argument that, even in the absence of an express choice of law clause, EU law may still form part

of the applicable international law. *!

The Claimant further argues that the Achmea judgment is “deeply flawed” since the ECJ “fails
to consider the basic international law principles of treaty interpretation, and in particular the one
of ‘systemic integration’ embedded in Article 31(3)(c) VCLT”.*" Therefore, according to the
Claimant, no authority can be accorded to the ECJ’s conclusion that intra-EU BITs conflict with
EU law." In particular, the ECJ’s holding in Achmea is incorrectly based on the potential, rather
than on the actual, application of EU law on the part of the Tribunal,.*!° Additionally, the ECJ
wrongly affirmed that the Achmea tribunal would have been unable to request a preliminary
ruling from the ECJ.“!’ The ECJ in Achmea could instead have “avoided a conflict of norms by
recognizing that intra-EU BIT tribunals qualify as courts or tribunals of EU Member States under

Article 267 TFEU.”"* In any event, no interpretation of EU law arises out of this dispute that

could be referred to the ECJ, as the issue of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is a matter of
international law. "'° Finally, the ECJ’s reasoning concerning “the alleged limited review of intra-
EU BIT awards under national law and on a supposed distinction with commercial arbitration”
is flawed, as the principle of party autonomy is the basis of both investment treaty and

commercial arbitration.’”°

The Claimant emphasises that the Tribunal is not asked to “second-guess the Court”, but rather
to “ensure that the relation between EU law and international treaties is viewed not through the
prism of the primacy of EU law but under general international law, which does not endorse such
primacy”.**! According to the Claimant, it follows that Articles 344 and 267 TEFU, on their

ordinary meaning, do not prohibit investor-State arbitration.

In any case, the Clamant submits that “even if EU law were applicable law under the [ECT] (quod
non), it would only be so in relation to merit issues.” ”? The Claimant argues that the alleged
conflict between EU law and investment treaties is one of jurisdiction, connected to states’

consent to arbitration.”*

As the Tribunal’s jurisdiction derives from the ECT, which does not
refers explicitly to EU law, the Tribunal is not bound by the Achmea judgment. In the absence of
“a clear positive rule of EU law prohibiting arbitration between an EU Member State and a
national of another EU Member State”,"”* the Tribunal should decide whether a conflict between

the ECT and EU law exists only on the basis of international law.“

arbitration is conducted are irrelevant to the application of the Achmea judgment.”* This is so,
because Article 344 of the TFEU prohibits EU Member States from submitting a dispute
concerning the interpretation or application of EU law to any external dispute settlement entities,
regardless of the latter’s governing procedural law.*”’ According to the Respondent, to interpret
the Achmea judgment otherwise would be contrary to its clear language and its purpose to ensure

the effectiveness of EU law.**

The Respondent notes that the ECJ decided that arbitral proceedings lack adequate safeguards to
ensure the “full effectiveness of EU law”, notwithstanding the fact that the arbitration giving rise
to the Achmea judgment had its seat in Germany, an EU Member State. This reasoning, so argues
the Respondent, applies a fortiori to this arbitration, in which the Tribunal’s award will be subject

to review by the courts of a non-EU country (i.e., Switzerland).”””

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant notes that the arguments elaborated in its answer to Question 1 “are even more
pertinent, because the seat of these arbitrations is in Switzerland, outside the EU.” From the Swiss
law perspective, EU law is res inter alios acta and in no way can be accorded primacy over
international law. Under Swiss international arbitration law, the Achmea judgment is irrelevant
to assess the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.”*° According to the Claimant, the ECJ in Achmea
recognizes that the principle of effectiveness of EU law is limited to the territory of EU Member

States.*!

3. Whether and how the Achmea judgment applies to the Energy Charter Treaty

Member States” in the operative part of the Achmea judgment “encompasses agreements reached
between Member States within a multilateral framework (such as the ECT) which includes non-

Member States as their Parties. ”“*

The ECJ intended its reasoning to apply also to multilateral
treaties “to the extent such agreements apply within the EU and do not affect [...] third States’
rights”.“* This conclusion is said to be confirmed by the fact that, in Achmea, the ECJ
intentionally reformulated the question put to it by the German Bundesgerichtshof from one
concerning a “bilateral investment protection agreement between Member States,” to one

concerning “international agreements] concluded between Member States” in general.*°

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the ECT differs from intra-EU BITs
because the EU is a contracting party to it. Specifically, the Respondent notes that, as also
confirmed in the Mox Plant decision in relation to the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea (“UNCLOS”), Article 344 TFEU “applies squarely” to multilateral treaties to which the
EU is a party.’ For the Respondent, a treaty involving the EU as a contracting party poses a
greater threat to the autonomy of EU law than treaties not involving the EU, because such treaty
becomes part of EU law."** Therefore (1) “any dispute about the interpretation and application of
the ECT within EU Member States automatically constitutes a dispute about the interpretation
and application of EU law”; (2) “the ECT cannot be applied as between EU Member States to
the extent it is contrary to the EU Treaties”; and (3) “in accordance with Article 344 of the TFEU,
EU Member States may not submit disputes concerning the ECT to non-EU dispute resolution
bodies."

Additionally, the Respondent notes that Article 26 of the ECT shares the same characteristics as
Article 8 of the CSFR-Netherlands BIT. On this basis, it rejects the Claimant’s contention that

the situation in this arbitration is different from that found in Achmea.“”

Further, the Respondent argues that the dictum in the Achmea judgment, which states that:

It is true that, according to settle-cased law of the Court, an international agreement
providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the interpretation of its
provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of
Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The competence of the EU in the
field of international relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements
necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or
designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their
provisions, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected [...]

 

is concerned only with “the possibility for the EU to subject itself to non-EU jurisdictions.”

Hence, it does not apply to this arbitration, which concerns a dispute settlement mechanism

included in an agreement concluded between EU Member States.“

The Respondent concludes that this Tribunal is bound to apply Article 351(1) of the TFEU,
pursuant to which Member States’ obligations under EU Treaties prevail over any conflicting
obligations in force between the Member States under other multilateral treaties.‘ This is in line

with the international law principle of pacta sunt servanda.““*

In this regard, the Respondent
suggests that the Tribunal follow the analysis of the tribunal in Electrabel S.A. v. The Republic
of Hungary — which found that, in case of incompatibility, EU law previails over the ECT’s
substantive protections —, and disregard the reasoning in Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A.
v. Kingdom of Spain — which held that Achmea does not apply to multilateral treaties such as the
ECT. For the Respondent, Masdar lacks “any analysis of relevant EU law”.“°

It is the Respondent's position that the applicability of Article 351 of the TFEU is not affected
by Article 16 of the ECT, which provides that ECT provisions “more favorable to the investor”
prevail over other treaties. The accession of the Czech Republic to the EU in 2004 pre-empted

incompatible previous agreements and their conflict clauses.” Nor can Article 16 of the ECT

prevail over Article 351 of the TFEU as /ex specialis, because the principle of primacy plays such

a central role in the legal system of the EU that it would be “manifestly absurd [and]

unreasonable” to assume that EU Member States would have “deliberately signed [it] away” by
joining the ECT.“*

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal must base its decision on international law rather than on
EU law." Questions of jurisdiction in ECT proceedings can only be decided on the basis of the
ECT’s terms and they do not give priority to EU law over the ECT. “ In the absence of a choice
of law clause providing for the applicability of EU law to this dispute, any jurisdictional conflict

between EU law and the ECT must therefore be resolved in favor of the ECT.“*!

Relying on Masdar and the Decision on the Achmea Issue in Vattenfall AB et al. v. Federal
Republic of Germany, the Claimant observes that Article 26(6) ECT only governs “the
substantive standards of protection, and not the provisions on dispute resolution, Article 26(6)
applies exclusively to the merits of ECT disputes and not to jurisdiction”.“”

Even if there was a relevant conflict between EU law and the ECT, such conflict should be
resolved on the basis of Article 16 ECT, providing that “the ECT’s provisions more favorable to
the investor prevail over those of other (prior or subsequent) treaties”, rather than on the basis of
Article 351 of the TFEU.** The Claimant contends that the prevalence of Article 16 ECT over
Article 351 TFEU is confirmed by all tribunals that have dealt with the issue, save for the tribunal

in Electrabel.***

The Claimant further submits that a “good faith interpretation of the instruments in question

cannot support the conclusion that the ECT does not give rise to inter se obligations among EU
Member States, including in relation to investor-state arbitration.“

According to the Claimant, the principle of harmonious interpretation is even more pertinent in

relation to the ECT, because the EU is itself a contracting party to this treaty, and this leads to

the presumption that “the EU intended to enter into obligations consistent with EU law.”**°

Citing Masdar, the Claimant highlights that “the Achmea judgment does not consider, and

therefore does not even purport to be relevant for, multilateral treaties like the ECT, to which the

EU itself is a party.”“°’ Further, the Claimant notes that the ECJ never mentions the ECT in
Achmea.** For the Claimant, the ECJ’s “silence speaks volumes”.**”

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that the reference to “international agreements

between Member States” in Achmea includes the ECT as inconsistent with ECJ jurisprudence,

which distinguishes between intra-EU agreements and agreements with third states.“

The Claimant also disagrees with the Respondent’s argument that Article 344 of the TFEU
applies to the ECT based on the Mox Plant judgment, where the ECJ found Ireland in breach of
EU law for having sued the United Kingdom before an arbitral tribunal. “' Such reference to Mox
Plant is inapposite, not only because the ECT does not include a disconnection clause (as, in
contrast, UNCLOS does), but also because, unlike Ireland, the Claimant is not asking the Tribunal

to apply or interpret EU law.

4. Whether and how the Achmea judgment actually impacts upon the jurisdiction of an
arbitral tribunal sitting outside of the EU, as distinct from the enforceability of
awards within the EU

(a) The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the ECJ’s interpretation of the EU Treaties “do[es] not create, but
clarify existing EU law [and] therefore take[s] effect from the date on which the relevant State
has become bound by” the instruments at issue.“ Thus, as the Achmea judgment makes clear
that the investment arbitration clauses in intra-EU investment treaties are incompatible with EU
law and therefore inapplicable as between EU Member States, the Tribunal does not have
jurisdiction to hear any claims submitted after the Czech Republic’s accession to the TFEU on
1 May 2004.‘ In this regard, the Respondent notes that “[t]his is a separate issue from the

enforcement of the award either inside or outside the EU.“

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that “[t]he Achmea judgment does not impact on the jurisdiction of a
Swiss-seated tribunal. The potential unenforceability of this Tribunal’s award within the EU is

irrelevant for jurisdiction under Swiss law.”

5. How the Achmea judgment fits in, if at all, with Articles 59 and 30 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties

(a) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that Article 59 of the VCLT is of no relevance to this case, because the
Achmea judgment concerns specific provisions of intra-EU investment treaties and not the

treaties as a whole.”

In contrast, Article 30 of the VCLT, which codifies the principle of /ex posterior, is “perfectly
consistent” with the Achmea judgment. Unlike Article 59, Article 30 of the VCLT applies to

specific treaty provisions, i.e., those enabling investment arbitration, and not the treaty as a

whole.*** The Respondent also notes that the “same subject matter” requirement in Article 30
VCLT “should not [...] be interpreted restrictively or applied at the level of the treaty as a
whole.” Instead, it should be deemed satisfied when “(i) a certain course of conduct attracts
the application of two different treaties and; (ii) the fulfillment of an obligation under one treaty
affects the fulfillment of obligations under, or undermines the object and purpose of, the other
treaty”,*” According to the Respondent, this is presently the case:*”' as both investment treaties
and the EU Treaties are concerned with intra-EU investment activities, it can reasonably be
expected that issues of EU law will arise in investor-State arbitration.*” The applicability of
Article 30 of the VCLT thus ensures the prevalence of the later treaty, the TFEU, over the earlier

investment treaty.

In any event, the residual nature of Article 30 of the VCLT paves the way to the application of
more specific conflict rules, such as Article 351 of the TFEU, as relevant /ex posterior.“ In
particular, Article 351 of the TFEU prevails over both the /ex posterior principle, codified in
Article 30 of the VCLT, and the /ex specialis principle invoked by the Claimant, which the
Respondent both regards as “default rules [inapplicable] in case a different conflict rule is
applicable between the Parties.”4”* In this regard, the Respondent notes that Article 351 of the
TFEU is of “general scope and applies to all international agreements which may impact on the
application of EU law, irrespective of subject matter”.”* Moreover, the Respondent argues that
Article 351 of the TFEU is a conflict of laws rule binding on all EU Member States, including

the Czech Republic, and thus represents part of the law applicable to the present dispute.*”°

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the ECT should be given precedence over
EU law as /ex specialis.*” In particular, the Respondent argues that investment treaties and EU
law lack “otherness”, which is necessary for the application of the /ex specialis principle. Instead,
the two regimes constitute “part and parcel of the same European legal regime that was intended

to increase economic integration and prosperity in Europe.”

The Respondent concludes that both Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30 of the VCLT render
the investor-State arbitration provisions in this p i i 48

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that “Articles 59 and 30 VCLT are not applicable for the resolution of the
(apparent) conflict at issue, because the treaties invoked by the Claimant and the EU Treaties do
not have the same ‘subject matter’.”"” In support of its position, the Claimant cites previous

awards holding that investment treaties:

(i) have a different and more specific objective than the EU Treaties, i.e. to protect foreign
investors and investments, (ii) provide broader substantive protection non-equivalent to
that available under the EU Treaties, for instance with reference to the FET standard, and
(iii) provide a fundamental procedural protection, i.e. investor-state arbitration, with no
parallel in the EU Treaties.*°°

The Claimant puts special emphasis on the analogous conclusions reached by the tribunal in
Marfin Investment Group Holdings S.A., Alexandros Bakatselos and others v. Republic of

Cyprus, which rejected the relevance of the Achmea judgment to its jurisdiction “on the ground

that Article 30(3) VCLT could not apply for lack of the same subject matter requirement.”*!

VCLT “must be construed strictly, as requiring the ‘same level of generality’ between treaties”.

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s position that investment treaties should be considered as
part of the EU legal regime.“** Instead, it argues that investment treaties “generate a specific
regime of international law” which gives investors access to a specific set of protection of the
host State “foreign to the “European law regime’”.“* Therefore, “[a]ny hypothetical conflict
between the [ECT] and EU law must be resolved in favour of the [ECT]”. “ This follows from
the /ex specialis rule as well as from the Tribunal’s obligation to give precedence to the sub-
regime to which it belongs in the event that another sub-regime, in this case EU law, claims

absolute superiority.

For the Claimant, the Respondent also wrongly invokes Article 351 of the TFEU. ** First, the
Claimant argues that, even if Article 351 of the TFEU was a special conflict rule, it would not
apply to the present dispute because EU law does not form part of the applicable law.“*’ Second,
the Claimant contends that the Tribunal need not rely on Article 351 of the TFEU, since the

provision only applies to States, i.e., not in relation to foreign investors and host States.***

The Respondent contends that Articles 27 and 46 VCLT are of no relevance in this case, as the
Respondent is not invoking its internal law to justify its position, but rather “a fundamental
incompatibility between successive international treaties [...] between the same contracting

parties” in accordance with Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30 of the VCLT.“”

In particular, the Respondent argues that the broad scope of EU law obligations, which also

include “doctrines developed by the ECJ, such as primacy, direct effect, effectiveness” does not

transform the law created by EU treaties into national law.*”° The Respondent highlights that the

Claimant itself confirmed in its submission on Achmea the international nature of EU law.*!

(b) The Claimant’s Position

According to the Claimant, Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT are applicable in this case:

[Articles 27 and 46 of the VCLT] prohibit the Czech Republic from relying on EU law,
qua domestic law, in order to escape its treaty obligations. In fact, EU law, despite its
international character, is deeply integrated into the domestic law of the Czech Republic,
of which it is an integral part?

On this point, the Claimant contends that EU law can be characterized as either international or
national law. Its national law character stems from the fact that “EU law gives rise to a special
legal order deeply integrated into the one of its Member States.”“” Therefore, “for the purposes

of Articles 27 and 46 VCLT, internal law includes [supranational] EC law.”**

The Claimant thus holds that the Respondent's position that “‘the “integration of the [...] TFEU
into domestic legal systems is no ‘deeper’ than that of any other treaty-based international law’

ignores the special features of EU law that make it a sub-regime of international law”, “* in

particular “its primacy over, and direct effect on, the Member States’ internal laws.”“”°

7. How Swiss courts and Swiss scholarship have considered the position of EU law in a
legal universe consisting of international law and domestic law

(a) The Respondent’s Position
According to the Respondent, EU law is considered by Switzerland, which is not an EU Member

State, as “public international law between third countries (res inter alios acta).”*°" Nevertheless,

given its close relationship with the EU, “EU law also plays an extremely significant role in the
Swiss legal system.” “°* For instance, more than one hundred international treaties that
Switzerland concluded with the EU became part of Swiss domestic law once ratified. *”
Additionally, on several occasions, Switzerland has unilaterally enacted domestic legislation
based on EU law, a practice known as “autonomous adaptation”. The uniform interpretation

of Swi

 

domestic law and EU law is thus necessary to ensure a level playing field,” and is

actively pursued by Switzerland’s judicial and government institutions.

The Respondent
concludes that “a consistent interpretation of the State’s obligations under EU law — one of the
driving principles of the Achmea judgment — is thus a recognized public interest in
Switzerland.”>

Regarding the applicability of EU law in Swiss arbitral proceedings, the Respondent discusses a
decision of the Swiss Federal Tribunal concerning the role of EU competition law in Swiss-seated
arbitration on “whether a Swiss arbitral tribunal was obliged to consider the validity of the
disputed contract under Article 101 of the TFEU, which prohibits anti-competitive
agreements.”*" The Respondent notes that the ECJ has decided in Eco Swiss v. Benetton
International that EU competition law (i.e., Article 101 of the TFEU) is “a matter of EU public

policy to be applied by commercial arbitral tribunals”.*°°

EU competition law constitute relevant public policy considerations.* As a result, a Swiss-
seated arbitral tribunal must take these provisions into account, notwithstanding the fact that

Swiss law is the governing law of the contract.”

Otherwise, the award would be susceptible to
annulment by reason of the tribunal’s failure to apply the applicable law in accordance with
Articles 190(2)(b) and 187(1) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law
(“PILA”). In determining the content of the relevant EU law, the Respondent asserts that the

Swiss Federal Tribunal follows the decision of the ECJ.°”

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant’s response to this question is as follows:

From the Swiss law perspective, EU law is res inter alios acta, and Switzerland has no
interest in ensuring, through Swiss courts, its general harmonization or consistent
application, any more than it has an interest in supporting the policy of other States.
Instead, customary international law and general principles of law are part of Swiss law
as international law within the meaning of Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution, and
preclude giving primacy to EU law.

According to the Claimant, Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution provides that the Swiss
Confederation and the Swiss cantons have to comply with international law norms that are
binding upon Switzerland. Those norms do not include EU law, as Switzerland is not an EU
Member State.*!” The fact that Switzerland has entered into several bilateral agreements with the
EU, and that it has unilaterally enacted domestic laws based on EU law, does not “give EU law
a special status in Swiss law.”*!! That said, the Claimant acknowledges that “interpretation [of
Swiss law] in harmony with EU law has been understandably considered preferable where

general, “Switzerland takes no stance towards the general harmonization of EU law [as it is] not

a policy concern for Switzerland.”*!*

In sum, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s position that the Tribunal must apply
mandatory EU law, lest its award may be set aside, is wrong for two reasons.*! First, pursuant
to Article 19 of the PILA, “there is no basis for the assertion that an arbitral tribunal seated in
Switzerland is obliged to apply foreign mandatory rules.”*'° Second, “it is undisputed that the

failure of a Swi:

 

ated tribunal to apply such rules, or to apply them correctly, is not a ground

for setting aside an award pursuant to Article 190(2)(b)”.5”

8. The impact, if any, of Article 177(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private
International Law

Article 177(2) of the PILA provides:

Ifa party to the arbitration agreement is a state or an enterprise or organization controlled
by it, it cannot rely on its own law in order to contest its capacity to be a party to an
arbitration or the arbitrability of a dispute covered by the arbitration agreement.

(a) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent points out that the goal of Article 177(2) of the PILA “is to prevent a State from
abusing its own sovereign legislative or executive powers”.*'* The provision prohibits a State or
its organ acting as a respondent before a Swiss-seated international arbitration tribunal from
invoking its domestic law to contest the validity of the arbitration agreement on grounds of non-
arbitrability or lack of capacity.*!? Against this background, the provision thus does not apply

“where the relevant legal change is outside a Party’s control.”*° As the Achmea judgment is not

attributable to the Respondent, Article 177(2) of the PILA is not applicable.*?!

The Respondent adds that, pursuant to Article 119 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the
arbitration clause contained in the ECT should be deemed extinguished and inoperative, as the
performance of the obligation to arbitrate has become impossible due to circumstances not

attributable to the party >?

(b) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that Article 177(2) is applicable in this case:*”*

The arguments that are sought to be drawn from the Achmea judgment by the Czech
Republic relate to the “arbitrability” of the dispute. This matter is governed by Article
177(1) PILA [Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law], which denies any role
to non-Swiss law, including EU law, for arbitrability. Arbitrability is to be assessed
exclusively pursuant to Swiss law, according to which the present dispute is fully
arbitrable. As regards the arbitrability of the dispute under Swiss law, it is irrelevant that
the award to be rendered by this Tribunal may be unenforceable within EU Member
States. It follows that, from a Swiss law perspective, the Achmea judgment is completely
irrelevant.

Article 177(2) PILA prohibits a State from relying on its “own law” to contest its
“capacity to be a party to an arbitration or the arbitrability of a dispute covered by the
arbitration agreement”. In light of Article 177(1) PILA, which already deals with
arbitrability ratione materiae and applies to both private and public parties, Article 177(2)
PILA is generally considered superfluous. Be as it may, in the present case it precludes
the Czech Republic from relying on EU law, which is clearly its “own law”5*

According to the Claimant, the Respondent’s arguments are meritless. First, the relevant EU law

is “internal law” of the Respondent. Thus, the Respondent cannot argue that the Achmea

 

judgment is not attributable to itself.“ As for the impossibility argument under Article 119 of
the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Claimant contends that “there is no physical impossibility to
perform the arbitration agreement”. Also, the legal impossibility under the provision does not
include the arbitrability issue, as such issue is “exclusively governed by the substantive rule of

Article 177 [of the PILA]”.*?°

9 The role of waiver/estoppel, including in light of Article 186(2) of the Swiss Federal
Code on Private International Law, in this context

Article 186(2) of the PILA provides:

Any objection to [the Tribunal’s] jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defense on the
merits,

(a) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that Article 186(2) of the PILA “only applies to objectively arbitrable
matters.”*”” In cases where the subject matter of the dispute is non-arbitrable, the Respondent
contends, the failure to raise a jurisdictional objection in a timely manner does not lead to the
foreclosure of such objection and the arbitral tribunal should examine the question of arbitrability
ex officio, given that “[a] party cannot waive a right that it did not have.”*** According to the
Achmea judgment, which is an “expression of EU mandatory provisions”, intra-EU investor-
State disputes are objectively non-arbitrable; such non-arbitrability cannot be waived and must

therefore be considered ex officio by this Tribunal.*”

In any case, the Respondent cannot be considered to have waived the intra-EU jurisdictional
objection because, to be effective, such waiver must be “clear and unequivocal”.**° As the
Respondent indicated in its Counter-Memorial that “it considered the intra-EU objection to
‘raise[ ] many complex and serious jurisdictional issues,’ which are more appropriately resolved
by the ECJ”, there is no clear and unequivocal waiver.**! The Respondent adds that it raises this

jurisdictional objection in a timely manner following the issuance of the Achmea judgment?

The principles of waiver and estoppel, which are firmly established in international law
and are enshrined in Article 186(2) PILA, apply in this case. In addition to all the other
reasons, the Respondent’s request that these cases be dismissed on the basis of the intra-
EU jurisdictional objection should be rejected because, under both international law and
Swiss law, the Czech Republic (i) waived the right to raise such objection; and (ii) is
estopped from raising it

The Claimant observes that “waiver is a well-established principle of international law which has

been consistently been applied by the ICJ”.*™ A waiver is effective if it meets these conditions:
(i) there must be a declaration or statement; (ii) made by a competent authority; (iii) of
the State whose rights are affected by the waiver; (iv) made in the context of a
claim/dispute; (v) not affected by individuality; and (vi) not revocable.5°5

In this regard, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s statement that it “does not raise (or

intend to raise) the intra~-European Union BIT objection” meets these six requirements and thus

 

constitutes an enforceable waiver."

In any event and separately, the Claimant contends that, pursuant to the well-established principle

337

of estoppel,’ the Respondent would be precluded from raising the intra-EU objection.’ The

relevant test is that “(i) the State must engage in a conduct or make a representation/declaration
having a reasonable appearance that the State will be bound by it; and (ii) a third party relies in

good faith.”**? Some tribunals have considered a third element, namely “a showing of detriment

for the party relying on the ion or ion”. The Resp *s that it

“does not raise (or intend to raise) the intra-European Union BIT objection”, the Claimant asserts,

satisfies these three requirements.*"!

As for the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s waiver and estoppel arguments do not

apply here, because “the Achmea judgment is the expression of EU mandatory provisions”, the

Claimant submits that waiver and estoppel “are overriding principles of international law” in

9 542

relation to the EU law sub-regime.*” In any case, “estoppel operates irrespective of whether the

representation of [the Respondent] is legal or correct.”*#

In respect of Article 186(2) of the PILA, the Claimant argues that it is applicable and bars the
Respondent’s “attempt to revive the intra EU-objections”.** In the Claimant’s view, the
Respondent “not only fail[ed] to contest the jurisdiction but expressly and unconditionally
[undertook] not to raise a jurisdictional objection.” Such behavior “falls squarely under Article
186(2).55

The Respondent’s argument that Article 186(2) of the PILA does not apply to “objectively
arbitrable matters” is considered flawed by the Claimant since this limit only applied to matters
which are non-arbitrable under Swiss law.*4° According to the Claimant, the question of
arbitrability is determined by reference to the broad definition of arbitrability found in Article 177
of the PILA, which encompasses “any dispute of financial interest”. The present dispute is thus
arbitrable under Swiss law, so says the Claimant, and whether it is arbitrable under EU law is

irrelevant. “’ With reference to academic commentary, the Claimant also rejects the

Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal should consider arbitrability ex officio.**

10. The Tribunal’s Decision

Having carefully considered the arguments presented by both sides, the Tribunal finds itself in
agreement with the Claimant. It holds that the Achmea judgment has no impact on this Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, as the Respondent is foreclosed from raising this objection at this stage of the

proceedings.

The seat of this arbitration is Geneva, Switzerland.” Importantly, the Tribunal is seated outside

the EU.

It is well accepted that the seat of arbitration determines the procedural law governing the
arbitration, and will likely impose procedural rules by which all parties must comply. Equally,
the arbitration law at the seat will dictate the extent to which domestic courts will involve
themselves, or may intervene, in the arbitral process, the degree to which an arbitral award may
be affirmatively challenged (i.e., set aside or annulled) and the grounds for such a challenge. The
Tribunal therefore cannot agree with the Respondent’s submission that the seat of arbitration is
irrelevant to the Tribunal’s analysis.’ On the contrary, the Tribunal is called upon to satisfy
itself that all Parties to this arbitration have complied with all relevant legal requirements at the
seat of the arbitration throughout the arbitral process, and that there is no issue with respect of its

jurisdiction as far as its seat is concerned.

It is for this reason that the Tribunal deems it appropriate to consider both the conduct of the
Respondent in raising its jurisdictional objection based upon the Achmea judgment, and the
impact of the Achmea judgment itself on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction from the perspective of Swiss

law and the likely approach of the Swiss courts.

Under the applicable Swiss procedural law, objections to an arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction must
be brought in a timely manner. Article 186(2) of the PILA, codifying the principle of foreclosure,
specifies that “[a]ny objection to [the Tribunal’s] jurisdiction must be raised prior to any defense

on the merits.” This provision does not spell out the consequences of a failure to contest

jurisdiction before dealing with the merits, but it is generally accepted that where a respondent
enters an unconditional appearance and makes submissions on the merits, such behaviour

constitutes an irrevocable waiver of its right to contest the arbitral tribunal's jurisdiction.**!

Similarly, Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that “[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal
does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than in the statement of defence or, with respect

to a counter-claim, in the reply to the counter-claim.”

In this case, there is nothing to which the Respondent can point to satisfy the requirement in both
Article 186(2) of the PILA and Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules that the jurisdictional
objection in question was raised no later than the statement of defence, or any defence on the
merits. Rather, as detailed below, the Respondent specifically and repeatedly stated throughout
these proceedings that it would not object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis of the intra-

EU nature of the dispute.

In the Response to the Notice of Arbitration, the Respondent noted that “the Czech Republic does

not raise (or intend to raise) the intra-European Union BIT objection”.**?

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent stated that “the Czech Republic does not plead a

fundamental incompatibility between investment treaties and EU law”.

At the Hearing, the Respondent submitted that the “Czech Republic, as you know, does not

advance an intra-EU jurisdictional objection in this case”.*™*

The Tribunal notes the Respondent’s contention that any waiver of rights under Article 186(2) of
the PILA, to be effective, must be expressed in “clear and unequivocal” terms.** In this regard,
the Respondent has drawn the Tribunal’s attention to what it considers to be qualifying language
in its submissions that would make any alleged waiver neither clear nor unequivocal. For
instance, in its Counter-Memorial the Respondent noted that “’the intra-EU objection raise[d]

many complex and serious jurisdictional issues’, which are more appropriately resolved by the

Ecy”6

Having carefully reviewed each of these statements, the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent.
In the Tribunal’s view, none of the Respondent’s referenced qualifications changes the nature of
its representations, and indeed undertakings, repeated at different stages throughout these
proceedings, that no jurisdictional objection would be raised with respect to the intra~-EU issue
(i.e., the same issue that has now been decided in Achmea). In all the circumstances, the Tribunal
therefore concludes that the Respondent waived any intra-EU jurisdictional objection. Had the
Respondent intended to reserve its rights, it could have done so by including express language to
this effect. The Tribunal considers that the Respondent’s waiver was “clear and unequivocal” and
therefore valid under Article 186(2) of the PILA.

There is then the question whether there is anything about the nature of the Achmea judgment

and the principle for which it stands that changes this analysis as a matter of Swiss law.

According to the Respondent, Article 186(2) of the PILA “only applies to objectively arbitrable
matters” and the Achmea judgment as an “expression of EU mandatory provisions” renders any
intra-EU dispute, including the present one, objectively non-arbitrable. In other words, the
mandatory nature of the rule of EU law identified in the Achmea judgment is such that the
Respondent is free to raise an objection based upon this rule in Swiss arbitral proceedings at any
stage, whether before, during or after defending on the merits, and without regard to the Swiss

rules on waiver.

The Tribunal does not agree. As both Parties have submitted, EU law is considered by
Switzerland as public international law between third countries (“res inter alios acta’”).*"
Pursuant to Article 5(4) of the Swiss Constitution, the Swiss Confederation and the Cantons shall
respect international law that is binding upon them. Similarly, Article 190 of the Swiss
Constitution provides that the Swiss Supreme Court and other judicial authorities are bound to
apply international law. These references to international law comprise only those norms of
international law that are binding upon Switzerland. This includes, for example, customary
international law, the general principles of law and the treaties signed and ratified by Switzerland.
However, since Switzerland is not an EU Member State, nor a member of the European Economic
Area, it cannot be said that EU law strictly forms part of international law within the meaning of
the Swiss Constitution, or enjoys a special status or primacy over other rules of international law.

The Tribunal is unpersuaded by the Respondent’s arguments that the policy of Swiss courts to

interpret Swiss statutes in harmony with EU law or the extensive network of treaties between
Switzerland and the EU have a bearing on the status of EU law within the Swiss legal order.
While these developments may be evidence of a growing economic integration between
Switzerland and the EU, they cannot, in and of themselves, fundamentally change the legal
character of EU law in Switzerland, or indeed the fact that Swiss courts are under no obligation
to follow the ECJ’s jurisprudence.*** The Tribunal therefore concludes that EU law does not
enjoy primacy in Switzerland. Accordingly, the question of objective arbitrability must be

determined from the perspective of Swiss law.

The applicable Article 177(1) of the PILA provides that “[a]ny dispute of financial interest may
be the subject of an arbitration”. This is a self-sufficient substantive provision of Swiss
international arbitration law, as opposed to a conflict of laws rule.’ As such, the Tribunal must
only apply this rule, to the exclusion of any potentially stricter foreign rules (even if closely
connected to the dispute). The Tribunal notes, in this regard, the Fincantieri judgment, in which
the Swiss Federal Tribunal upheld a partial award on jurisdiction, finding that the commercial
embargo imposed by the United Nations against Iraq did not affect the arbitrability under Swiss
law of a dispute involving an agency agreement for the conclusion of contracts with the Republic
of Iraq, and that the fact that an award rendered in Switzerland might not be enforceable in other
jurisdictions pursuant to Article V(2) of the New York Convention was not a relevant factor for

the purposes of Article 177(1) PILA.*°

It bears mention here that there is a consensus amongst commentators on Swiss law that foreign
law has no bearing on arbitrability in Switzerland, even if it is considered part of the public policy
of the foreign system at issue — unless it is also part of Swiss international public policy within
the (restrictive) meaning of Article 190(2)(e) PILA.**' But the Tribunal has seen nothing to justify
a conclusion that the principle identified in the Achmea judgment constitutes Swiss international
public policy (as this notion has been defined). On the contrary, as the Claimant has noted,
Switzerland has signed and ratified numerous BITs with different States, including EU Member

States, providing for investor-State arbitration, and has manifested a clear pro-arbitration policy.

See e.g. SFT, Case No. 124 II 193, Judgment, 19 March 1998, para. 6a (Ex. CLA-251); SFT, Case No.

** the Tribunal considers this of

In so far as the Respondent relies on the decision in Eco Swiss,
no assistance. This decision concerned the law applicable to the merits of the dispute, whereas
the Achmea judgment (as the Respondent itself has asserted) raises an issue of objective
arbitrability, which in this case — unlike in Eco Swis

of the PILA.

 

is governed exclusively by Article 177(1)

It follows that applying Article 177(1) of the PILA, the present dispute, which clearly involves
financial interests, is objectively arbitrable under Swiss law. Whether the dispute is also arbitrable
under EU law need not be decided by this Tribunal. More specifically, whether the award is
enforceable outside Switzerland, or within the EU, has no impact on objective arbitrability within

Switzerland.

It also follows that the Achmea judgment and the principle of EU law for which it stands cannot

have the effect of ignoring the procedural rules applicable to this Swiss arbitration.

Further, Article 177(2) of the PILA precludes a State, which is a party to an arbitration agreement,
from invoking its own law in order to contest the arbitrability of a dispute covered by such an
arbitration agreement. It applies squarely to the present arbitration. To the extent that the
Respondent argues that Article 177(2) of the PILA is not applicable in the present circumstances
as the Achmea judgment is not attributable to the Respondent, the Tribunal disagrees. EU law,
including the obligation to comply with judgments from the ECJ, forms part of the domestic legal

563

system of the Czech Republic.

In light of these considerations, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary or appropriate to
pronounce itself on the application of the Achmea judgment to an arbitration brought under the
ECT.

The Tribunal concludes that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the Achmea judgment

cannot be relied upon by the Respondent. It has no impact on this Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

MERITS
WHETHER THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
STANDARD
1. Whether the Respondent Failed to Provide a Stable Legal Framework

(a) The Claimant’s Position
The Claimant argues that the Respondent violated its obligation to accord the Claimant and its
investment fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) under the ECT by changing the legal framework
applicable to investments in the photovoltaic power plant market.* In the present case, the

Claimant submits that the obligation to provide FET is contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT. **
Article 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage
and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting

Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant

protection and security [...].°°°

According to the Claimant, FET is a flexible standard, breaches of which may be established by
reference to several types of host States’ conducts, which may partially overlap.*” Such conduct
includes (1) the failure to provide a stable and predictable investment framework; and (2) the
failure to protect a foreign investor’s legitimate expectations; and (3) the failure to act in a

reasonable manner.***

First, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to provide a stable and predictable

 

framework by it ducing the Solar Levy, ing the Income Tax Exemption, and
changing the Shortened Depreciation Period.*”
For the Claimant, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment framework may

be distinguished from the obligation to protect an investor’s legitimate expectations.*” The

former enshrines a host State’s general obligation not to change its investment framework
retroactively to the detriment of a foreign investor, while the latter requires an examination of an
individual investors’ expectations. Accordingly, the Tribunal may determine that the host State
violated the obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework “without a specific
consideration of the individual investors’ expectations.”*”' Accordingly, the obligation to provide
a stable and predictable investment framework should be examined from an objective
perspective, regardless of whether a host State has provided a specific assurance or whether an
investor has acknowledged such a specific assurance.°””
According to the Claimant, the obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment
framework stems from two sources in the present case: first, from the inherent nature of the
incentive legislation and, secondly, from the specific treaties that are presently applicable, i.e.,
the ECT.”

First, the Claimant argues that the Act on Promotion, the relevant ERO regulations and the Act

on Income Tax jointly established the Incentive Regime, which offered investments in the

S78

photovoltaic sector the FiT, the 5% rule,” the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened

Depreciation Period.*” In the Claimant’s view, it was the Incentive Regime’s purpose to attract
foreign investment in the RES markets by granting them sufficiently profitable returns in order
to meet the 8% EU Indicative 2010 Target.*” According to the Claimant, it follows from the

described nature and the purpose of the Incentive Regime that the Respondent was not allowed

to change the regime before foreign investors obtained the promised benefits.°””

Second, the Claimant argues that the object and purpose of the ECT is (a) to promote investments
between the Contracting States, for example, by providing a long-term incentive regime, and (b)
to require host States to protect investors from legislative changes for a reasonable period of

time.5”

In particular, the Claimant refers to Article 10(1) of the ECT which expressly requires host States
to “encourage and create stable [...] conditions for investors.”*”” The Claimant emphasises that
this provision should be interpreted in accordance with the object and purpose of the ECT as set
out in its introductory note, namely strengthening “the rule of law” on energy matters which,

according to the Claimant, strictly prohibits retroactive regime changes.**°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that a stabilization clause would be necessary

to stabilize the Incentive Regime.**'

First, the Claimant points out that the Respondent acknowledges that the Act on Promotion
provided a promise of stabilization when it stated that investors were entitled to expect the 15-
year simple payback and the 7% return under the Act, even if the Act does not entail any specific

stabilization clause.**

Second, the Claimant argues that an express contractual stabilization clause is not necessary to
prohibit a host State from changing its investment scheme, considering that, in the RES market,
direct contracts with the Government are unusual, as RES producers typically are small
businesses and the RES electricity produced is sold directly to the network operators. *°
Accordingly, in the Claimant’s view, it is unreasonable to require a specific contractual clause to
impose an obligation on the host State to stabilize its investment regime. * In this regard, the

Claimant notes that its position is in line with relevant regulatory practice in the RES market,

(Ex. C-23).

according to which agencies usually do not review an incentive mechanism once it is set.**°

To support this argument, the Claimant refers to an ERO report which provides that the Act on
Promotion was “bringing a guarantee of long-term and stable promotion necessary for decision-
making by businesses”, without mentioning contractual stabilization clauses.**° The Claimant

rejects the position advanced by Professor Cameron that it would not be recommendable for

 

investors to enter foreign markets without an express stabilization commitment, since this
analysis allegedly failed to consider the RES market’s specific background.**” Additionally, the
Claimant notes that, even if the Respondent unintentionally promised stabilization without a

Republic of Poland,**’ decided that the requirement of stability is fundamental to the FET
standard.*” Finally, the Claimant contends that the tribunal in Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve
Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan** found that a mere change of a host State’s

investment policy can constitute a breach of the FET standard.*”

The Claimant accepts the Respondent's definition of the term “retroactive”, conceding that “from
a legal perspective, a law affecting only future situations is not technically retroactive”.“°
Nevertheless, the Claimant maintains that the term “retroactive” should be used vis-a-vis existing
investments, stating that such language would be appropriate from a business perspective, and

that the EC used the term in the same manner in its letter of 11 January 2011.°!

(b) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the Respondent failed to provide a stable
and predictable investment framework by introducing the Solar Levy and repealing the Tax

Incentives.*

First, the Respondent emphasizes the presumption that a host State does not violate its treaty
obligation by simply changing its domestic law, noting that a State must be free to serve the

public interest through legislative modifications.°

Second, the Respondent criticizes the Claimant’s use of the word “retroactive”, stating that the
Claimant in substance claims that “retroactive” implies that the Respondent may not change the
future treatment of any existing investment, while the term in fact implies the withdrawal of a

treatment granted in the past.

Third, the Respondent alleges that a mere change of the legal framework applicable to the

confuses the notion of stability with the distinct concept of stabilization, explaining that a
guarantee of stabilization prohibits a host State entirely from changing its legislation, while a
mere obligation to provide stability does not.°° Referring to the decisions in Total S.A. v.

matter, limit a State’s discretion to change or modify its national legislation unless the treaty
contains a specific stabilization provision or other specific mechanisms to this effect. In the
Respondents view, this is particularly true in the energy sector where regulators often intervene
to address market failures such as, for example, monopolies or the abuse of market power.*”
According to the Respondent, this view is shared by certain Middle and South American
countries, which enacted legislation that provides for the possibility of contractual stabilization
clauses.°!° The Respondent argues that such express stabilization arrangements must clearly
stipulate that existing laws “continue to apply to the beneficiary even in the face of legislative or

regulatory change, and/or identification of a remedy in the event the beneficiary is subjected to

should not be interpreted as incorporating a stabilization arrangement in the absence of other

In the present case, the Respondent alleges that it did not provide a guarantee of stabilization to

“maintain” is not sufficient to conclude that stabilization was intended.! The language only
meant to indicate that the tax relief would continue even after the complete opening of the
electricity market. In contrast, the wording did not intend to stabilize the legislation.” The
Respondent also notes that since the Explanatory Report was neither a law, regulation, nor decree,
these wordings are not binding upon the Czech Republic in any event. Similarly, the wording
“[the Act on Promotion] [...] bring[s] a guarantee of long-term and stable promotion” in the ERO

report of 2009 was not sufficient to stabilize legislation.©*

In response to the Claimant’s argument that a contractual stabilization clause is not necessary to
stabilize the legislation, since the investors in the present case were unable to enter into a
contractual relationship with the Respondent to obtain a stabilization guarantee and that it would
therefore be unreasonable to require a contractual stabilization clause, the Respondent concedes
that a stabilization clause does not always have to be a contractual provision, but can also be a
legislative arrangement. However, the conditions for such a legislative stabilization are not

fulfilled in the present case.°*

Finally, in response to the Claimant’s allegation that the Respondent admits that the Incentive
Regime provided a promise of stabilization, the Respondent agrees that the Incentive Regime
was designed to provide a 15-year simple payback and a 7% return, but maintains that no further,

or other, promise was given."°°

Accordingly, the reasonableness of a host State’s measures is irrelevant to this standard.“
According to the Claimant, the following three-pronged test has been developed in investment

arbitration to establish whether a violation of an investor’s legitimate expectations has occurred:

“(i) The Respondent made a promise, assurance or representation of regulatory stability;

(ii) the Claimant relied on such promise, assurance or representation; and

(iii) such reliance (and expectation) was reasonable.”

In relation to the first step, the Claimant argues that the decisive question is “whether [a host
State] acted in a manner that would reasonably be understood to create such an appearance”.

Conversely, the host State’s actual intent is said to be irrelevant.“

However, the Claimant agrees
with the Respondent’s view that, objectively considered, an investor’s expectations must have
been objectively legitimately formed at the time of the investment and that minor expectations
are not protected.“ The latter restriction is immaterial in the present circumstances, however,
since according to the Claimant its expectations as to the stability of the Investment Scheme were

fundamental to its investment decision and therefore not minor.“*

Additionally, the Claimant argues that the notion of legitimate expectations is closely related to
the notion of transparency, which entails an obligation to provide information as to potential

legislative changes, noting that Article 10(1) of the ECT contains both obligations.“

With respect to the first limb of the above test, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent made
the following promises of regulatory stability: (1) the FiT level would be stable for 20 years
pursuant to Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion, and the relevant ERO regulations; (2) the
Income Tax Exemption would continue to apply for six years, pursuant to Section 19(1)(d) of the
Act on Income Tax; and (3) the Shortened Depreciation Period, ranging between five to ten years,

would be available, pursuant to Section 30 of the Act on Income Tax.“

The Claimant argues that the promised legislative stability as detailed above stems from (1) the

legislation which established the Incentive Regime; (2) the very purpose of the Incentive Regime
itself; (3) the Respondent’s promotional activities surrounding the Incentive Regime, and (4) the

particularities of the licensing process to operate the Claimant’s plants.“

First, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent’s promise of stability is apparent, since the
Incentive Regime contained clear rules through the Act on Promotion, the 2007 Technical
Regulation, the 2009 Pricing Regulation, and the Act on Income Tax.*” With regard to the Act
on Promotion, the Claimant notes that Article 6(1)(b)(2), and the relevant provisions under the
Technical Regulation and the Pricing Regulation, established that the FiT would be payable for
20 years.®*' According to the Claimant, the promised stability was not limited to a 15-year simple
payback and a 7% return rate. In this regard, the Claimant objects to the Respondent’s
argument that Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion, which allows investors to recover
investment costs within 15 years, supersedes Article 6(1)(b)(2), arguing that Article 6(1)(b)(1) is
only meant to specify the criteria for establishing the FiT level.®° The irrelevance of the return
rate in setting FiT is supported by the fact that the ERO did not review the return rates annually.
The Claimant emphasizes that Mr. Jones, the Respondent’s industry expert, agreed at the hearing
that the 15-year simple payback would not have attracted investments in the Czech RES
market. Similarly, the WACC, as set by the ERO at 7%, was not sufficient to achieve the 8%
EU target for 2010. In addition, the Claimant submits that a WACC was no more than an
indicative technical parameter to calculate FiT under the Technical Regulation.*” Moreover, the

Respondent’s argument ignores the importance of stability from a business perspectives.°*

The Claimant further submits that the Act on Income Tax provided the promise of legislative

stability jointly with the Act on Promotion.®° As evidence for this, the Claimant points to the

Explanatory Report, which mentioned that the Incentive Regime is “based [...] [o]n maintaining
the tax reliefs to the extent set out in the Acts on Income Tax”. In addition, the Claimant states
that a general legal framework is likely to create legitimate expectations when it offers long-term
benefits to attract investors, adding that the legislative expectations may arise even if the legal
framework does not address individual investors. Similarly, the Claimant states that, even if
the Shortened Depreciation Period was not specifically designed for photovoltaic energy
producers, the solar energy producers could legitimately expect that the Shortened Depreciation

Period would be stable, because it was a part of the Incentive Regime.°?

Lastly, according to the Claimant, the decision of the tribunal in Charanne B.V., Construction
Investments S.A.R.L. v. The Kingdom of Spain, which found that the claimants, who were
Spanish RES investors, could not rely on legitimate expectations, may be distinguished from the
case at hand because in Charanne the alleged guaranteed period amounted to 30-50 years, and

therefore was unreasonably longer than in the case at hand.°*

Second the Claimant argues that it was the Incentive Regime’s purpose to create legitimate
expectations, because its ultimate goal was to help the Respondent to meet its EU targets,
especially the 8% Indicative 2010 Target under the 2001 Directive. The Incentive Regime did
so by offering stable incentives to prospective investors. With regard to the FiT, the Claimant
alleges that the Explanatory Report expresses this purpose well, providing that: “[it was]
necessary to create a support system which, given the well-known high investment costs, will
create the necessary climate for investors with a long-term guarantee of return on investments

made”.°7

With regard to the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Tax Period (collectively “Tax

Incentives”) the Claimant states that its purpose was closely related to the Act of Promotion to

jointly provide a long-term incentive scheme. To support this argument, the Claimant submits
that the Explanatory Report states that “the promotion system is based [...] on maintaining the
tax reliefs to the extent set out in the Act[s] on Income Tax” to meet the EU target for the year
2010.°° In response to the Respondent’s assertion that the 8% target was not binding, the
Claimant submits that Mr. Jones, the Respondent’s industry expert, also admitted that “[the
Czech Republic] wished to achieve the 8% [target]”.°” In addition, the Respondent’s argument
that a significant contribution of solar energy was not expected, is at odds with a number of items
of evidence, including the ERO’s report of 2009, which provided that “[photovoltaic energy was]

of key importance for the fulfilment of the indicative target.”"°”

In the Claimant’s view, the decision of the Tribunal in PSEG,°” which held that the legislative
purpose of a State measure in that case was insufficient to support the argument that the host
State’s government actively attracted foreign investments, may be distinguished from the present

case, as the purpose of the Incentive Regime is sufficiently clear.°”

Contrary to what the Respondent alleges, the Claimant argues that the Explanatory Report
constitutes a sufficient basis for legitimate expectations.“ Although the report is not a source of
law, it is evidence of the Czech Republic’s intention to attract photovoltaic investors.“ The
Claimant further argues that the fact that the Explanatory Report does not mention the Shortened
Depreciation Period is due to the fact that the Act on Income Tax already provided a clear promise
of stability in the period.° That the Explanatory Report does not address the Claimant
individually is also irrelevant, because individual knowledge is not necessary for legitimate
expectations to arise.” Moreover, the Claimant alleges that it had actual knowledge of the 2010

Action Plan, which mentioned that financial support was available to RES investments.°”*

Third, the Claimant argues that the Czech Government and the ERO officials launched an intense

marketing campaign to promote the FiT offered under the Act on Promotion, submitting several
examples of this campaign. °”

According to the Claimant, its representative attended a number of conferences in which the

Czech Republic’s officials explained that the FiT would be stable for 20 years for plants

 
 

commissioned by the end of 2010.%° In response to the Respondent’s argument that these

  

presentations were to highlight the possibility of retroactive changes, the Claimant submits that

such an argument is at odds with the text of the presentation slide. In addition, the official did not

mention the possibility of a retroactive regime change."

In support of its argument that the Respondent intended to attract foreign investors, the Claimant
submits that the “Q&A tool” was translated, and published specifically for foreign investors.“
With respect to the “Q&A tool”, the Claimant notes that it explained that the FiT would apply
for 20 years. Moreover, the Claimant submits that the 2010 Action Plan did not provide for a
cap on the total volume of electricity for the FiT, and that the plan forecasted a significant rise of

photovoltaic installations for the year 2010.

With respect to the fact that the Respondent did not advertise the Tax Incentives together with
the Act on Promotion, the Claimant explains that it was merely because the Respondent promoted
only the new portion of the Incentive Regime.***

Fourth, the Claimant argues that the complex licensing process for the construction and operation
of photovoltaic installations turned the Respondent’s general promises into specific promises.*°
The Claimant explains that it completed the licensing process before becoming aware of the risk
of retroactive change and that the licensing process played an important role in increasing its

expectations as to the stability.’ Finally, in response to the Respondent’s argument that the

licensing process did not address the stability of the Incentive Regime, the Claimant states that
the licensing process itself does not necessarily need to refer to the source of the stability to create
an expectation of stability.
Lastly, the Claimant alleges that the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment, in which the
Czech Constitutional Court denied the petitioner’s expectations as to the stability of the Incentive
Regime, is irrelevant to the present case.’ As a threshold matter, as indicated in the Case
concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (United States of America v. Italy) judgment and the TECO
decision, a domestic court decision does not shield a host State from international liability arising
out of a treaty provision.” In addition, the decision is distinguishable from the case at hand,
because the Czech Constitutional Court employed the domestic standard of legitimate
expectations, under which the court focussed on the Solar Levy’s impacts on the investor’s

691

property right, instead of on a promise provided for by the Czech Republic.” The Claimant also

notes that the Constitutional Court’s loyalty to the State might have affected its decision.©”

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal should adopt a three-step analysis to establish whether
the Respondent failed to protect the Claimant’s legitimate expectations. In particular, the
Tribunal should analyse (1) whether the Claimant had legitimate expectations; (2) whether the
Claimant reasonably relied on those legitimate expectations; and (3) whether the violation
amounts to a breach of the investment treaties.® In relation to the last element, the Respondent
states that minor expectations do not trigger a treaty violation. Additionally, according to the

Respondent, the Tribunal should analyse the relevant circumstances objectively, and it should

ensure that any expectations were formed at the time of investment. In respect of the threshold
question whether legitimate expectations objectively existed, the Respondent refers to a four-step
test:° First, the host State must have given a clear and unequivocal assurance.” Second, the
State’s assurance must apply to individual investors.* Third, the investor must have relied on

the State’s assurance. Fourth, the investor’s reliance must have been reasonable.””

In its analysis of the reasonableness of the investor’s reliance, the Respondent argues that the
Tribunal should also take account of social and economic circumstances.”! In this regard, the
Respondent submits that an investor’s expectations as to a stable investment regime are not
“reasonable”, unless the host State gives a specific assurance of stabilization. This is especially
true in the energy sector, where regulatory changes are frequent.” Further, the Respondent
alleges that legitimate expectations can only derive from specific legislative provisions.” Since
the Claimant does not refer to any specific provisions of the Act on Income Tax on which it
allegedly relied in making its investment decision, no legitimate expectations could arise in the

first place.”

In response to the Claimant’s allegation that the legitimate expectations may be derived from the
purpose of the Incentive Regime, the Respondent argues that a legislative purpose is not
sufficient, viewed in isolation, to create legitimate expectations, even if the purpose itself is

clear.” In addition, the Respondent notes that the Claimant does not discuss the purposes of

specific provisions, but only refers to an alleged overall purpose.” Moreover, the Respondent
argues that the Claimant has failed to provide any evidence that the Incentive Regime purported
to attract photovoltaic investors by providing stable incentives in order to achieve the 8%
Indicative 2010 Target.””” The Respondent emphasizes that the 8% target was non-binding on the
EU Member States.’ Moreover, no evidence shows that the WACC was set to achieve the 8%
target or that the Czech Republic employed the solar boom to achieve the 8% target.” The
extension of the estimated lifetime of photovoltaic plants from 15 years to 20 years was
introduced to lower the FiT.”"° According to the Respondent, while the Act on Promotion was
designed to promote all forms of RES investments, a substantial contribution from photovoltaic
energy was not expected.’!! The Respondent further submits that, because more than half of the
solar capacity was installed in the last three months of 201 1, solar energy did not in fact contribute
significantly in achieving the 8% target, which measures RES consumption during the full
calendar year.’'* The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s assertion that the CEZ’s active
investments in 2009 and 2010 demonstrate the caretaker government’s positive view as to the
solar boom, stating that the CEZ’s management is independent from the Czech Government and

that the CEZ in fact repeatedly expressed negative comments on the solar boom.”

In relation to the Claimant’s argument that a 7% post-tax return rate as WACC, would have been

insufficient to attract investors to the Czech photovoltaic market, the Respondent submits that

714

 

the WACC is idered as the “mini amount necessary to induce i an
understanding also shared by Dr. Garcia, the Claimant’s expert.’'° The Respondent emphasizes
that in the present arbitration, the Claimant does not challenge the ERO’s calculation of WACC

at 7%.”"° Moreover, the Respondent points out that Mr. Senogles, the Claimant’s expert,

calculated WACC for the Claimant as below 7%.”'’ The Respondent further submits that a 7%

post-tax rate is within the range of WACCs set in other States.’'* The Respondent also submits

that the adequacy of the 7% WACC for attracting investments is supported by a steady increase
during the period from 2003 to 2005.”

With respect to the Claimant’s argument that the legislation of the Incentive Regime and the
relevant political discussions during the enactment process of the Act on Promotion created the
Claimant’s legitimate expectations, the Respondent contends that the Explanatory Report does
not support the Claimant’s argument.”° First, the report is not a source of law and was submitted
two years before the Act of Promotion’s text was even finalized.”! Second, the report is irrelevant
to the incentives under the Act on Income Tax and does not even refer to the Shortened
Depreciation Period.’”” Moreover, the Respondent argues that, although the Explanatory Report
briefly mentions the Income Tax Exemption, the drafters did not intend to maintain it in light of
the rapid increase in solar installations, which was not expected at the time of drafting.” In this
regard, the Respondent states that even if Article 19(1)(d) of the Act on Income Tax contained
the 5-year Income Tax Exemption, the Tax Exemption would still be subject to any changes for
these 5 years.” Similarly, the Respondent posits that even if the Act on Income Tax established
the Shortened Depreciation Period, it should not be considered as an assurance to freeze the
depreciation period.’ Third, the Respondent contends that the Explanatory Report only contains
general explanations and no specific assurances which would be necessary to create a promise of
stability in the energy sector.”° Fourth, the Respondent observes that the Claimant offers no

evidence that it actually relied on the Explanatory Report.”””

The Respondent further relies on the decision by the tribunal in Charanne,”* which was faced
with a similar explanatory report published in that case by the Spanish National Energy
Commission. In that case, the tribunal found that while the explanatory report contained specific
language that the expected legislative changes would not affect existing investors, this still did
not constitute sufficient evidence to support the claimants’ argument that stabilization was
intended.” The Respondent also finds support for its position in the May 2012 Constitutional
Court Judgment, in which the court concluded that the introduction of the Solar Levy and
withdrawal of the Tax incentives did not constitute a violation of investors’ legitimate

expectations.”

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the licensing process could not create a promise of
stability for the Tax Incentives, because the issued license did not specifically refer to the Income

Tax Provisions.”"!

With regard to the Income Tax Provisions, the Respondent makes a number of points.” First,
the Respondent contends that the Claimant has submitted no basis for its expectations as to the
Income Tax Provisions.” Indeed, according to the Respondent, the alleged governmental
campaigns did not make any reference to the Income Tax Provisions.” Second, the Respondent
submits that the Czech Ministry of Finance had already started to contemplate the abolition of
the Tax Exemption as early as November 2009. The Ministry of the Environment expressly
discussed the enactment of the Solar Levy in July 2010, with the Ministry of Finance becoming
involved in September 2010.”* As to the Shortened Depreciation Period, the Respondent alleges
that it is unreasonable to expect that it would be stable only in relation to solar power plants, since
it did not constitute photovoltaic specific legislation.”° In addition, the Respondent submits that

the Czech Technical University, in its study for ERO of 2007, already expected that the Income

Tax Provisions would be modified.”*”

In the face of the influx of investors, the Czech caretaker government stated that measures would
be put in train after the elected government took office — which was done. In its public statements,
ERO only described the present investment regime and gave no guarantees that it would be

maintained in view of the solar panel investment influx.

(b) Whether the Claimant Relied on the Respondent’s Promise
(1) The Claimant’s Position
The Claimant argues that it relied on the Respondent’s promise that the Incentive Regime would
be available for the lifetime of its plants at the time of its investment decision.” In particular,
the Claimant argues that its business model was based on the assumption that the stable inflation-
adjusted FiT would be available for 20 years for plants commissioned by the end of 2010.”
Lastly, and so as to explain the background of its investment decision, the Claimant adds that the
Incentive Regime and the drop in solar panel prices jointly made the Czech market particularly

attractive for investors.”

(2) The Respondent’s Position
The Respondent argues that the Claimant does not provide any evidence of its reliance on the
Explanatory Report or any other alleged assurance by the Respondent and therefore denies that
any legitimate expectations could have been violated.”'

(c) Whether the Claimant’s Reliance on the Respondent’s Promise was
Reasonable

(1) The Claimant’s Position
The Claimant submits that its reliance on the Respondent’s promise was reasonable considering
that the Claimant was entitled to expect that a host State would exercise its general right to change
its investment legislation in a reasonable manner. “? In particular, it is reasonable for investors

to expect that the promised scheme would not be changed in an irrational manner.”

Page 149 of 204

In the present case, the Claimant alleges that it reasonably relied on the Respondent’s promise,
because of the following three factors: first, the inherent nature of the Incentive Regime was such
as to encourage reliance on it; second, the Respondent continuously provided assurance that any
changes in the Incentive Regime would apply only to new investors; and, third, investors and
banks widely believed that the legal framework would remain stable.” Relying on a judgment
of the English Court of Appeal, which decided that retroactive measures were unlawful,” the
Claimant further asserts that its reliance was reasonable, even though there was no explicit

commitment to stabilize the Incentive Regime.”

Elaborating on the above reasons, the Claimant submits that the Incentive Regime is designed to
attract RES investments, which requires long-term guarantees and a promise of stability.” The
Claimant emphasizes that the Act on Promotion did not set any cap on RES electricity entitled to
FiT.™* With regard to the Tax Incentives, the Claimant submits that, even if businesses in general
should expect possible tax scheme changes, the Claimant’s reliance on the Tax Incentives was
reasonable, because, unlike ordinary corporate income taxes, the Tax Incentives featured a

promise of stability for a certain duration.”

In support of its argument, the Claimant points to Professor JUDr. Ale’ Gerloch’s comment that
the Act on Income Tax promised that the incentives would be available for a certain period of
time and that, therefore, the Czech Government was not allowed to repeal the incentives in
relation to investors that already made use of them.” The Claimant also argues that the same

rationale applies to the FiT contained in the Act on Promotion.”*!

Second, according to the Claimant, investors received a number of reassurances that the changes
in the Incentive Regime would not affect investments made by the end of 2010.’* For instance,

when discussing the change of the 5% rule, the Czech Government and the ERO expressed their

concern about negative effects on existing investors.”*? The Claimant further alleges that its belief
was strengthened by the moratorium period on new applications for grid connections as of
February 2010; the 2010 National Renewable Action Plan published in July 2010"; and Act No.

Claimant points out that the ERO’s 2010 report explained that “investors expected a change to
the law [...] for new plants”.”*’ The Czech Government’s proposal of an amendment of the Act
on Promotion of 13 October 2010 stated that the Government, instead of existing investors, would
provide new finance to the Incentive Regime.”* With regard to the Ministry of Industry and
Trade’s press release of 24 August 2009, by which it informed the public that it was planning to
introduce amendments to the Act on Promotion, the Claimant submits that only four days after

the press release, the Ministry proposed that the abolition of the 5% rule be introduced to plants

commissioned as of 2011 without affecting existing investments.

In this regard, the Claimant emphasizes that its investment was made well before the introduction
of the amendment measures, and that accordingly it was not able to anticipate these measures.”
The Claimant further notes that its investment became “sunk” upon acquiring the SPV and
entering an Engineering, Procurement and Construction contract. ”°' Accordingly, in the
Claimant’s view, the reasonableness of the Claimant’s reliance should be examined at this point,
after which it was not able to cancel its project.’

The Claimant submits that it was not officially informed that the Respondent intended to modify

existing investors about possible changes to the regime.”

In this regard, the Claimant emphasizes that, in the solar sector, investors are usually small
businesses and that accordingly it is unreasonable to expect them to conduct extensive legal due

diligence.”

Third, the Claimant argues that the widespread belief among investors and banks in the stability

of the Incentive Scheme shows that the Claimant’s reliance was reasonable,”

submitting that
the Tribunal in CMS v. Argentina recognized the relevance of widespread expectations, as it was
unlikely that several professionals make the same mistake at the same time.”” In particular, not
only investors, but also Czech banks believed that the FiT level would be stable.” The Claimant
further points out that the Respondent itself believed in such stability, since it gave licenses to
energy experts, which conducted “energy audits” for banks in advance of their approval of

investments.”

Moreover, the Claimant notes that the Czech banks and auditors also understood
that the FiT level would apply to plants commissioned by the end of 2010 without considering
the 15-year simple payback and the 7% rate of return.” In this regard, the Claimant submits that
the CEZ, a State-owned entity, also significantly invested in the photovoltaic market in 2009 and

2010.7"

With regard to the Czech Constitutional Court’s decision, which held that the Solar Levy was
permissible, the Claimant states that no investor could reasonably have anticipated that decision
at that time.” As evidence for this, the Claimant submits that the ERO officials repeatedly

assured the FiT level would remain stable for the plants’ lifetime.”

Lastly, the Claimant alleges that the fact that a caretaker government was in place between May

2009 and July 2010 is irrelevant.” In the Claimant’s view, the caretaker government’s lack of

power to change governmental policies did not amount to a “political crisis or political
instability” under which investors could not reasonably expect that a legal framework would be
stable.” The Claimant submits that unelected caretaker governments existed frequently in
European and other countries.’ Contrary to the Respondent’s assertion, the Claimant alleges
that it was a political decision by the caretaker government to keep the support for the solar
industry in 2010 at the 2009 level.’”’ The caretaker government's positive view of the solar boom
is demonstrated in the Czech police report of 3 October 2013, which suspended criminal
proceedings against the ERO Direction. Those proceedings had been instituted based upon a
suspected abuse of power arising out of the ERO’s extension of the life period of photovoltaic
facilities from 15 to 20 years, and its failure to alter the parameters for 2009.” The fact that the
CEZ, a State-owned entity, significantly invested in the photovoltaic market in 2009 and 2010

also supports the assumption that a revocation of the incentive regime was not expected.”

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant’s reliance on any alleged promises was unreasonable

for a number of reasons.”

First, in its analysis of the reasonableness of the investor’s reliance, so argues the Respondent,
the Tribunal should also take account of social and economic circumstances. The Respondent
alleges that the Claimant entered into the market, notwithstanding that it knew, or should have
known, that the RES Scheme was financially not sustainable for the year 2010.7"! In fact, since
July 2009, the ERO and the Ministry of Industry and Trade, in their consultations, presentations
and press releases, had warned of possible changes to the Act on Promotion. They considered the
7% WACC was an original target under the Act on Promotion.” Moreover, the Respondent

submits that on 24 August 2009, before the Claimant made its investment, the Ministry of

Industry and Trade issued a press release that it was planning to amend the Act on Promotion.”
In addition, several other sources at the time of the solar “bubble” indicated that a regime change
might be in the offing.” As evidence of this, the Czech Technical University, in its study for

ERO of 2007, already expected that the Income Tax Provisions would be modified.”

Reliance on the assumption that the regime would not change in the face of the dramatic influx
of investments, was unreasonable — especially for investors who entered into the market in the
fall of 2010, as Claimant did for its second investment project Sluneéni. As evidence for this, the
Respondent points out that Mr. Chroustovsky, a shareholder and board member of SolarOne,

d the possibility of legislative changes in the ibility study prepared for the Claimant
in October 2008.”*° Mr. Chroustovsky also acknowledged that media sources used the term “solar
boom” and that legislation might be amended so as to react to the growth of the photovoltaic
market.”*’ The Respondent argues that if tariffs are too beneficial, as in the present case,

reasonable investors should expect so called-retroactive changes.”**

The Respondent submits that the tribunals in AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza
Erémii Kft v. The Republic of Hungary” and Electrabel v. Hungary” concluded that Hungary’s
re-introduction of administrative pricing for electricity generators was permissible.”"' In the
Respondent’s view, these cases provide useful context in the present case, because the challenged
State measure was also meant to reduce excessive profits to the originally intended level.”” In

because the termination of the administrative pricing was predictable, the Respondent alleges
that the issue in those cases was not the termination, but the re-imposition of the administrative

pricing.”

Second, the Respondent argues that legitimate expectations must exist at the time the contract to
supply energy is concluded.” In the present case, with respect to the Tomsan plant, the
Respondent argues that the Claimant was or should have been aware of the possibility of

Respondent observes that this connection actually was made after the amendment measures

Respondent denies that any “guid pro quo” existed between the Parties.” The Respondent adds

that the reimbursement of investment costs is not at issue in the present case.”

Fourth, the Respondent objects to the Claimant’s argument that the CEZ’s active investments in
the photovoltaic market in 2009 and 2010 support the reasonableness of the Claimant’s
reliance.”* The Respondent submits that the CEZ repeatedly expressed its negative view as to

the solar boom and that it purchased existing projects instead of building a new plant.”

(d) Whether the Respondent Violated the Claimant’s Legitimate Expectations
(1) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent violated the Claimant’s legitimate expectations by
introducing the Solar Levy and eliminating the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened

Depreciation Period.*”"

In relation to the Act on Promotion, the Claimant objects to the Respondent’s position that, since
the Solar Levy only affects after-tax profits, it did not violate the Claimant’s legitimate
expectations.“” The Claimant explains that the Act on Promotion guaranteed “revenue” at the
stable FiT level, which is affected when the Solar Levy deducts a certain percentage from the
revenue deriving from the FiT.* In this regard, the Claimant points out that the Respondent
itself defined the Solar Levy as “a tax ‘imposed on revenue’ of solar installations”.*** Moreover,
the Claimant observes that, although its expert, Mr. Senogles, used the same revenue figure in
both actual and counterfactual scenarios in his calculation tables, this was just meant to show

how the Solar Levy deducts the revenue.*”

Second, the Claimant notes that its legitimate expectations were not limited to the 7% return rate
or the 15-year simple payback.*” Rather, the relevant parameter is whether a stable FiT level for

the 20-year lifetime of the project was guaranteed.*””

Third, the Claimant argues that the reasoning of the arbitral awards relied upon by the Respondent
is not applicable in the present case. With respect to Toto Costruzioni,* which held that the FET
standard does not entail a guarantee of stability of a tax law regime, the Claimant alleges that the
case dealt with the specific circumstance in Lebanon.*” With respect to AES and Electrabel,
which found that Hungary’s change in its investment scheme was lawful under the ECT, the

Claimant argues that investors in those cases were able to forecast Hungary’s repeal of the

administrative price regime.*'° In addition, the relevant legislation contained the language “profit
necessary for ongoing operation”, which is more restrictive than the language “revenue” used in
the Act on Promotion.*"! Further, the increase in the return rate that investors in the Electrabel v.
Hungary case received (from 10.7% in 1997 to 39% in 2005) significantly differs from the

increase in the case at hand."

In response to the Respondent’s argument that a memorandum in 2009 notified the Claimant that
the Respondent’s measures would impact on its project’s “profitability”, the Claimant argues that

the memorandum did not mention that the measures would affect existing investors.“

(2) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent alleges that the legitimate expectations as to the stability of the Incentive Regime

the Claimant may have had, were not violated by the Respondent.

With regard to the Solar Levy, the Respondent first alleges that it did not change the level of the
FiT, because the levy did not reduce either the FiT price set in the ERO price regulations or the
total revenue from the FiT; it only affected after-tax profits. *'* Accordingly, in the Respondent's
view, the Solar Levy is consistent with Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion, which
allegedly provides, together with the relevant ERO regulations, that the FiT will remain stable
for 20 years.*!5 In addition, the Respondent states that even if there was a violation of Article
6(1)(b)(2), this would only amount to a breach of local law, which does not rise to the level of a

violation of FET, FPS, or Non-Impairment standards.*"°

Referring to Toto Costruzioni Generali S.p.A. v. The Republic of Lebanon,*"’

the Respondent
submits that a host State violates the FET obligation only if it makes a “drastic or discriminatory
change in the essential features of the transaction.”*'* In the present case, however, there was no

such radical change.*”” In fact, the amendment measures only decreased overall returns for plants

commissioned in 2009 and 2010 by 1.4% (8.4% to 7%) and 3% (11.4% to 8.4%) respectively.
In the Respondent’s view, the Act on Promotion was meant to provide for a 7% lifetime return
and a 15-year payback and the implementation measures did not repeal these. The Act on
Promotion did not contain a promise of good “profitability” of investments. **! In fact, a
memorandum by Worthald Partners (of which Mr. Chroustovsky, one of the shareholders of
SolarOne, was CEO) presented in the summer of 2009 acknowledged that the investment’s
“profitability” was not guaranteed and that it might be threatened by legislative changes during
the planned project period.*” In support of this position, the Respondent also relies on the award

in AES™ and the decision in Electrabel,™*

which concluded that Hungary’s reduction of profits
to the originally purposed level, covering costs and reasonable return only, was permissible under

the ECT.*5

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis
(a) Analysis of the Incentive Regime and of the Facts

Before embarking upon its FET analysis, the Tribunal finds it useful to set out its understanding
of the Incentive Regime that is at the core of the Parties’ dispute, and to summarize the relevant
chronology of the facts in light of the Claimant’s respective investments in the Tomsan and

Sluneéni projects.

According to the Claimant, the part of the Incentive Regime relating to taxation dates back to the
introduction of the Act on Income Tax in the year 1992, which provided for the Tax Holiday and
the Shortened Depreciation Period for different types of RES - producers.*° The Tribunal
observes that the withdrawal of the Tax Incentices is not covered by the ECT because of the

exclusion under Article 21 ECT.

In March 2005, the Respondent adopted the Act on Promotion, with the legislative objective of
promoting renewable energy sources and which, important for present purposes, introduced the
FiT. The FiT system obliged grid operators to purchase all electricity produced from RES on a

priority basis at a price annually determined by the ERO — the Czech Energy Regulatory Office

— pursuant to Article 6 of the Act on Promotion, which has been set out earlier in this Award.*””

It is important to note that the Act on Promotion does not contain all details of the Incentive
Regime. Article 6(1) provides that the ERO will define the FiT for solar electricity one calendar
year in advance. Article 6(1)(a) specifies that the FiT must be set so as to allow the Respondent
to meet the 8% Indicative 2010 Target and Article 6(1)(b)(1) provides that the FiT must be such

that the investment in certain PV plants can be paid back within 15 years.

By the Technical Regulation dated 30 November 2005 and amended in 2007 and 2009, the ERO
set out the general technical and economic parameters in order for newly installed plants to
achieve the 15-year payback period provided by Article 6(1)(b)(1) of the Act on Promotion.***
Again as set out earlier in this Award, section 4 of the Technical Regulation stated that:
In order for the 15-year _pay-back period to be assured through the support by
Purchase Prices [FiT] of electricity produced from renewable sources, technical and
economic parameters of an installation producing electricity from renewable sources

must be satisfied, where the producer of electricity from renewable sources shall achieve,
with the given level of Purchasing Prices

b) an adequate return on invested capital during the total life of the installation,
such return to be determined by the weighted average cost of capital (WACC),

and

c) the net present value of the cash flows after tax over the total life of the
installation, using a discount rate equal to WACC, at least equal to zero.*”
(emphasis added)

The Technical Regulation thus confirmed that the FiT was fixed to obtain a 15-year payback
regime with an adequate return on the investment during its lifetime as determined by the WACC.
The after-tax WACC in turn was set by the ERO at 7%. In other words, the Act on Promotion
guaranteed a FiT that led to a 15-year payback of the investment costs with WACC (or a profit)
of 7% per year over 15 years. In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that these were the Act

on Promotion’s primary targets.

This conclusion is not altered by the fact that Article 6(1)(b)(2) of the Act on Promotion stipulated
that the “amount of the revenues stays unchanged for the unit of the electricity from renewable
sources with the support of the buy-out prices for the period of 15 years since the year, when the

device was put into operation as minimum amount”. The Tribunal is of the opinion that one

cannot read the first part of that provision in isolation from the remainder of the clause. Notably,
Article 6(1)(b)(2) makes reference to the FiT, or “buy-out prices”, previously mentioned in
Article 6(1)(b)(1) and provides that the FiT is to “support” the “amount of the revenues”
generated by renewable sources. Article 6(1)(b) refers to the FiT and buy-out prices. It does not
provide an abstract guarantee of revenues, but makes those revenues dependent on the buy-out
prices. Moreover, it indicates that the buy-out prices had to be established following the criteria
contained in the Technical Regulation. The promised revenue is therefore necessarily linked to
the FiT. The FiT in turn was set by the ERO, pursuant to the Technical Regulation and, as
explained above, it guaranteed a 15-year payback with a 7% WACC. No other independent

revenue was promised to investors.

The Tribunal notes that the same conclusion was reached by the Czech Constitutional Court in

its May 2012 decision.*”

In addition, the Tribunal considers that the modalities of the Incentive Regime were not set in
stone. On the contrary, the implementation of the Act on Promotion through the Technical
Regulations was amended in the course of time. This was confirmed by the Explanatory Note to
the 2007 ERO regulation which stated that the economic and technical parameters would have to

change over the course of time and would not remain fixed:

 

Given the constant pment and imp s of the using

resources on the one hand and the changes in input prices on the other, these technical

and economic parameters need to be changed over the course of time.**!
While the 2005 Technical Regulation estimated the useful life of a PV installation at 15 years,
the 2007 Technical Regulation extended the latter period to 20 years.** Through the extension
of the life span from 15 to 20 years and the maintenance of the 15-year payback criterion, the
2007 Technical Regulation in fact confirmed the increased profitability of the photovoltaic
investments. The ERO further added that a post-tax 7% WACC for 20 years would be a

reasonable compensation.

Afterwards, the 2009 ERO Regulation introduced a 2% annual increase of the FiT, although the
Act on Promotion, Article 6(b)(2), only states that the FiT would be affected by the Index for

Industrial Products.

Between 2008 and 2010, when the Claimant entered into the PV plant business, the effect of the
5% limitation and the 2% annual increases was to limit the decrease in the FiT to about 9%.'™
However, the price of PV panels had decreased by more than 40% in the same time period. This
meant that by 2010, the level of compensation attributable to the FiT was some 30% more than
had originally been intended and was considered efficient and fair. These conditions naturally
attracted many investors, who wanted to invest in PV RES. Because the investments became
extremely attractive, the number of PV plants and their capacity increased between | January
2008 and 1 October 2009 from 249 / 3.4 MW to 2,900 / 116.72 MW.**> In June 2009, the payback

was said to be 6 years instead of 20 years***, and in July 2010 still 8 years instead of 20 years.**”

Already in 2009, political and energy sector circles in the Czech Republic were aware that the
then current Incentive Regime was problematic and, because of the solar boom, would become
even more problematic with time. Political action was difficult, because in March 2009, the
Czech Government had resigned. On 19 June 2009, a newspaper reported that the authorities
wanted to end the solar boom, but noted that the changes would not be introduced in 2009,
because of the political situation in the Czech Republic.“ Indeed, the caretaker government had
declared that it would leave all controversial matters for the newly elected government, once it
took office. Elections were expected before the end of 2009, but had to be postponed until 28-29

May 2010. A new government only assumed office on 13 July 2010.

In the meantime, in early July 2009, the ERO suggested an amendment to the Act on Promotion
to cope with the solar boom and indicated that in some parts of the country, connections of PV
plants to the grid were effectively refused.*” On 24 August 2009, i.e. ten days before the Tomsan
investment was made, the Ministry of Industry issued a press release to draw attention to the fact

that the subsidy system had become untenable and announced that it would abolish the 5%

limitation rule as of 1 January 2010.5°

Further intimations of change were evident before the Sluneéni investment was made in April
2010. In November 2009, the ERO predicted substantial problems with other RES producers,
which were disadvantaged, and with consumers, who had to bear ancillary costs. In February
2010, a moratorium was put in place, which precluded future connections to the grid. In March

2010, the PV sector had sent an open letter to the Czech Parliament about the problem.*!

After the investments were made, more signals of imminent and required change were given, but
by then the investments had already been made. On 22 July 2010, a newsletter highlighted the
problem, indicating that the Government was intent upon “cut[ting] the absurdly lucrative
revenues of the solar barons” and that the Minister of Finance was considering the withdrawal of
the Tax Holiday.“” In a July 2010 Action Plan, the Ministry of Industry and Trade described the
regime as it stood, but the Tribunal does not consider that an investor could possibly have relied
on this report as a basis for an expectation that the regime would not change in the future,

especially when considered jointly with other contemporaneous events.**

On | January 2011, the following amendments came into force: (1) the abolition of the 5%
limitation for FiT reductions for new plants as of 2011; (2) the withdrawal of the Tax Incentives;

and (3) the introduction of the Solar Levy. The Tribunal notes that these changes were already

foreshadowed before the Claimant made its investments.

The possibility that the 5% rule would be abolished had been mentioned already in June 2009,84

and in August 2009, this change was announced."

As for the Tax Incentives, the Tribunal notes that the withdrawal is not covered by the ECT

because of the exclusion under Article 21 ECT. Besides, the Tribunal considers that they had no

structural link to the incentives stemming from the Act on Promotion, which makes no mention
of tax exemptions. Only the Explanatory Report drafted two years prior to the Act on Promotion,
mentioned tax benefits as part of the Incentive Regime. The Tribunal is of the view that the
relevance of the Explanatory Report is negligible, since it does not have the status of legislation
and only depicts the general context. Moreover, when the Government campaigned to encourage
PV investments, the tax incentives were not mentioned. On the contrary, a 2007 study of the
Czech Technical University for ERP expected that the tax regime would be modified. Although
it is not established that the Claimant was aware of this study, it is plain that the study reflects
the thinking in 2007 about tax incentives and is therefore pertinent in this context. In November
2009, the abolition of the tax incentives was contemplated by the Ministry of Finance. On 23 July
2010, the Minister of Environment stated that he intended to cut the Tax Holiday. Thereafter,
Act 346/2010 amending the Income Tax Act was introduced, and on 12 November 2010,

approved.

While the Tribunal is aware that the introduction of the Solar Levy occurred after the Claimant
made its investments, it observes that the Claimant was already informed by the 2007 ERO
regulation that the economic and technical parameters would have to change over the course of
time and would not remain fixed.**” Moreover, Mr. Chroustovsky, one of the board members and
shareholders of SolarOne, had already warned SolarOne and the Claimant of the risk of

legislative change which would reduce the investment’s profitability.“

Overall, the Tribunal concludes that it was already clear towards the end of 2009 that the 5%
limitation would be abolished. Amendments in the tax regime were foreshadowed as early as
2007. In November 2009, they were under consideration by the Minister of Finance and a
decision to implement them was made in July 2010. As of June 2010, there was concrete
speculation about the introduction of a Solar Levy. On the basis of this understanding, the

Tribunal now turns to the different heads of claim put forward by the Claimant.

(b) Discussion of the Claims

As already set out earlier in this Award, the Parties are divided as to whether the Respondent, by
implementing the Solar Levy and withdrawing the Tax Incentives, has violated the Claimant’s
right to FET under Article 10(1) of the ECT:

2010 (Ex. R-206).

Article 10(1) of the ECT provides, in relevant part:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage
and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting
Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant
protection and security [...].

In essence, again as noted earlier, the Claimant asserts three heads of claim under the FET

standard: (1) the Respondent’s violation of its obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal

framework; and (2) the Respondent’s violation of the Claimant’s legitimate expectations. The

Tribunal will consider the arguments pertaining to each of the two in turn. In a last step, the

Tribunal will examine (3) whether the Respondent’s actions were taken in a non-transparent

manner in violation of the FET standard.

(1) Stable and Predictable Legal Framework

As for the alleged violation of the Respondent’s obligation to provide a stable and predictable
legal framework as part of the FET standard, as set out in more detail earlier, the Claimant
submits that the Respondent failed to provide such a framework by introducing the Solar Levy,
removing the Income Tax Exemption and abolishing the Shortened Depreciation Period.“ In the
Claimant’s view, the Incentive Regime established by the Act on Promotion, ERO regulations
and the Act on Income Tax between them created the Incentive Regime, which the Respondent
was precluded from changing before foreign investors could obtain the promised benefits. The
Respondent rejects the Claimant’s characterization of the Incentive Regime as guaranteeing
stability. It maintains that mere changes to the legal framework applicable to the Claimant’s

investment do not give rise to a breach of the ECT or BIT.

As the Tribunal has already noted, the Act on Promotion provided for a 15-year payback and the
maintenance for a period of 15 years of the amount of revenue per unit of RES electricity. The
question, however, is whether the introduction of the Solar Levy and the Tax measures were in

breach of the Respondent’s obligation to provide a stable and predictable framework.

Having carefully considered all materials before it, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that
it did not expressly undertake any agreed stabilization commitment, be it contractual, legislative,

individual or otherwise, vis-a-vis the Claimant’s investment.**° Had the Tribunal found that such

The Tribunal has decided that the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation Period are
excluded from the ambit of ECT pursuant to its Article 21 (see para. 309).

stabilization commitment existed in the present circumstances, there would obviously have been
a solid basis to allege that changes in the law applicable to the foreign investment in question
were unlawful. In the absence of such express commitment, however, the Tribunal must now turn
to the question whether an obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework for
foreign investment is, in any event, a separate and distinguishable part of the treaty obligation to

accord FET.

In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that such a separate obligation exists as part
of the FET standard. While there is a certain overlap between the two, this obligation is legally
distinct from the protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations. This is apparent from the
wording of Article 10(1) of the ECT, according to which “[e]ach Contracting Party [...] shall
create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors”. Investment
tribunals have consistently decided, and this Tribunal agrees, that the obligation to guarantee a
stable and predictable investment framework forms part of the FET standard. Compelling reasons

to deviate from this established jurisprudence have not been put forward by the Respondent.

The obligation to provide a stable and predictable investment framework is to be considered
objectively. It is a general obligation of host countries under investment treaties and does not
require the demonstration of any reliance on the host State’s conduct on the part of the foreign
investor. This said, the Tribunal finds itself in agreement with the line of cases that have held that
the requirement of stability is not absolute and must not be interpreted overly broadly.**! In
particular, it does not in all circumstances affect the state’s inherent right to exercise its sovereign
power to respond to changing circumstances, for example with revisions in its legislation or legal
system. As aptly put by the Tribunal in Total, in words with which the Tribunal is in full
agreement, “changes to general legislation, in the absence of specific stabilization promises to
the foreign investor, reflect a legitimate exercise of the host state’s governmental powers that are

not prevented by a BIT’s fair and equitable treatment standard”.**

 

The next issue is whether the Respondent violated its obligation in the circumstances of the

present case.

The Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant’s argument that the fact that the Incentive Regime was
intended to attract foreign investment, in and of itself, meant that it also offered a commitment
of stability and predictability to foreign investors. To support its argument, the Claimant points

not only to the Act on Promotion, but also to the Explanatory Report and the implementing

See, e.g., Continental Casualty, para. 258 (Ex. RLA-34) and AES, para. 9.3.29 (Ex. RLA-41).

regulations. While the Tribunal acknowledges that the Explanatory Report in particular used
terms such as “stable” and “maintain”, the Tribunal considers that such language, in the absence
of an express stabilization commitment, is insufficient to ground the obligation for which the
Claimant contends. In particular, the use of such words in the context in which they appear did
not, in the Tribunal’s considered view, signal an undertaking by the Respondent, much less a
specific undertaking to this Claimant, that there would be no changes whatsoever to the legal
framework created by the Act on Promotion — in particular in the event of radically changed
circumstances (such as the solar boom in 2009-2010, which fundamentally changed the financial
soundness of the support regime). On any view, this would have been a far-reaching undertaking,
with potentially extreme consequences for the Respondent and its citizens. No such agreement

can be inferred from the few words or other matters relied upon by the Claimant.

Moreover, the Tribunal observes that the Solar Levy did not, in fact, repeal the fundamental
features of the Incentive Scheme, as described earlier. The Claimant still received a stable FiT.
The Solar Levy had either to be paid quarterly by the energy producer or it could be withheld by

the energy distributor.

Further, and in any event, the Tribunal points out that the Tax Statute did not contain a reference
to stability or to the maintenance of the Income Tax Exemption and the Shortened Depreciation

Period.

The Tribunal finds that the changes introduced by the Respondent to the Incentive Regime were
part of the exercise of the Respondent’s sovereign right to regulate tariffs — in particular in the
context of the solar boom and its substantial adverse consequences as described earlier. They did
not violate the Respondent’s obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework for

foreign investment.

The Tribunal is confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that, even after the Solar Levy reduced
excessive profits, PV investors still secured a more than reasonable return. Without the legislative
amendments, the reference plant would have received a full payback in 7.8 years. Following the
amendments, the payback could still be achieved in 9.9 years, and was therefore well below the
promised 15 years.**} The return for the reference plant without the amendments would have been

11.4%, while - with the amendments - the return amounted to 8.4%, and hence remained well

First Expert Report by Mr. Michael Peer, dated 14 October 2015 (“First Peer Report”), para. 4.8.1: the
pay back for the Claimant would have been 6.6 or 7.8 years respectively without amendments, and was 8
or 10.1 years respectively with the amendments, i.e., also well below the promised 15 years,

above the promised 7% return rate.* In other words, despite the amendment measures, PV
investments were as profitable - and in fact more profitable - than envisaged when the support

system was created.

(2) Legitimate Expectations

As for the second claim, the Claimant argues that the Respondent violated the Claimant’s

legitimate expectations by repealing the Tax Incentives and introducing the Solar Levy.

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal considers that little, if any, guidance on the question of
legitimate expectations may be gleaned from the May 2012 Constitutional Court Judgment. The
Court in that case held that the petitioners did not have legitimate expectations as to the stability
of the Incentive Regime. The Tribunal shares the Claimant’s view that domestic court decisions
cannot shield a State from international liability arising out of a treaty violation. Therefore, while
certainly informative, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to engage with, or adopt, the

reasoning of the Czech Constitutional Court.

As regards the relationship between regulatory autonomy of host States and the FET standard,
especially in the context of legitimate expectations, the Tribunal subscribes to the view expressed

by the Tribunal in Micula, which held that:

The fair and equitable treatment standard does not give a right to regulatory stability per
se, The state has a right to regulate, and investors must expect that the legislation will
change, absent a stabilization clause or other specific assurance giving rise to a legitimate

expectation of stability. Thus, the Claimants’ “regulatory stability” argument must be

analyzed in the context of the protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations."

The Tribunal is also entirely in agreement with the following reasoning of the Micula Tribunal:

When the alleged legitimate expectation is one of regulatory stability, the reasonableness
of the expectation must take into account the underlying presumption that, absent an
assurance to the contrary, a state cannot be expected to freeze its laws and regulations.
‘As noted by the Saluka tribunal, ‘[nJo investor may reasonably expect that the
circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made remain totally unchanged.
In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor’s expectations was
justified and reasonable, the host state’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate
domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as well.”
Accordingly, for a state to violate the fair and equitable treatment standard by changing
the regulatory framework, the investor must have received a legitimate assurance that the

 

First Peer Report, para. 4.8.3: The return for the Claimant would have been 14.4% or 11.5% respectively
without the amendments and was 8% or 8.2% respectively with the amendments, i.e., also well above the
promised 7% return rate, All the measures together reduced the return for the 2009 reference plant from
8.4% to 7%; Hearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 230:8-18.

relevant laws and regulations would not be changed in his or her respect.**°

Additionally, the Tribunal finds guidance in the approach of the Tribunal in Duke Energy v.
Ecuador, which stated that:

The stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor’s
justified expectations. The Tribunal acknowledges that such expectations are an
important element of fair and equitable treatment. At the same time, it is mindful of their
limitations. To be protected, the investor’s expectations must be legitimate and
reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment. The assessment of the
reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including not only
the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and
historical conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations must arise
from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon
them when deciding to invest.5*”

The Parties essentially agree on the applicable test in this case to establish whether there has been
a violation of an investor’s legitimate expectations, namely: (a) whether the Respondent gave an
assurance as to regulatory stability; (b) whether the Claimant effectively relied on such assurance;
(c) whether this reliance was reasonable, taking into account the prevailing social and economic
circumstances** in the energy sector and at the time; (d) whether the Respondent violated the
Claimant’s legitimate expectations, bearing in mind that de minimis violations do not meet the
necessary threshold for treaty violations.**° This test is consistent with the elements considered

by other international tribunals.

Each of these elements is considered in turn below, in light of all the matters set out earlier in

this Award.

a) TheR did not give any as to regulatory stability.

 

First, having carefully considered all materials and submissions before it, the Tribunal accepts
that no assurance was ever given by the Respondent that the support system from which the
Claimant benefitted would never change. The relevant tax legislation did not state for how long
the favourable tax regime would be applicable. Equally, the Act on Promotion only provided that

the revenues would depend on buy-out prices, which were established on the basis of criteria to

be determined by ERO. It did not indicate that the FiT would remain unchanged for the duration
of a plant’s operation. Moreover, the ERO 2005 Technical Regulation, which implemented the
determination of the FiT, had already been amended only two years later, in 2007, thus illustrating
that in the energy sector, and certainly the Czech energy sector, regulatory changes were frequent.
Moreover, the Tribunal fails to see how the Claimant could draw an assurance of legislative
stability from a prospective 2003 Explanatory Report to the 2005 Act on Promotion, which stated
that the forthcoming Act purported to achieve “a stable promotion” of investments. Nor does the
Tribunal see how a mere mention in a 2009 ERO Report that the Act on Promotion brought a
guarantee of long-term and stable promotion, could be understood as a confirmation of the Czech
Republic’s obligation not to alter the legislative framework. The Tribunal agrees with the
Respondent that in the absence of a stabilization provision, the Incentive Regime could be altered

whenever there was economic justification to do so.

As stated above with regard to the Respondent’s treaty obligation to maintain a stable and
predictable legal framework, in the absence of an express stabilization commitment, changes to
address the solar boom were within the Respondent’s regulatory power. And this all the more so,
given that, ultimately, the changes in issue did not significantly undermine the actual support as

originally envisaged.

As for the tax incentives in particular, contrary to the Claimant’s position, the Tribunal considers
that, fairly judged, the Respondent never created the impression that these incentives, which had
already existed since 1992, could never be withdrawn. Moreover, these measures were not an
integral part of the Incentive Regime in any event. They were only sporadically mentioned in the
2003 Explanatory Note issued two years before the Act on Promotion was promulgated. And
they were not included in the presentations on, and descriptions of, the incentives for PV

investments.

In all the circumstances, in the absence of any assurance by the Respondent, the Tribunal
concludes that the Claimant cannot have had a legitimate expectation that the Incentive Regime
on which it relies would always remain in place and unchanged, and that the Respondent would

be precluded from exercising its usual regulatory power in this regard.

b) The Claimant did not rely upon any such assurance

Second, even if an assurance had been given by the Respondent, the Tribunal concludes that it

was not, or would not have been, relied upon by the Claimant at the relevant time.

In the Tribunal’s view, the relevant moment to assess whether the Claimant relied upon any

alleged assurance as to the stability of the Incentive Regime is when the actual investment was

made, i.e., on 27 August to 7 September 2009, when SolarOne purchased from Mr. Szolony 90%

8 and

of the share capital of Tomsan for CZK 74,350,*°! Tomsan entered into the EPC contract,
the solar panels were bought.‘ For the Tribunal, the Claimant's crucial investment commitments
in the first project, Tomsan, occurred in the brief period of late August/early September 2009. It
was then that, for the purpose of the present arbitration, the Claimant’s investments were “sunk”

in the first project.

On 29 December 2009, SolarOne purchased from Union Lesni Brana a.s. the entire share capital
of Sluneéni park Dubi for CZK 2,200.8“ However, it took over three months before the contract
for the installation of the solar panels was concluded on 8 April 2010.*°* Comparing the relatively
low costs for the acquisition of the SPV Sluneéni and its solar license (CZK 2,200,000) with the
costs for the installation works (EUR 262,000) and the acquisition of the solar panels (EUR
2,044,880.60), the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s investment in the second project,

Sluneéni, was “sunk” in April 2010.

The Claimant appears to agree that the latter two points in time are relevant for the Tribunal’s

assessment.‘

The actual date on which the operations were started was later, upon connection to the grid, and
is obviously of less importance for the purposes of determining the basis upon which the

investment was made.

Therefore, the relevant time period for the Tribunal’s enquiry is between late August/early

September 2009 and April 2010 respectively.

The Tribunal has seen no evidential basis that either (a) when the investment decision was made
on 29 October 2008 or (b) when it actually acquired the share capital of Tomsan s.r.o. 27 August
2009 and of Sluneéni on 29 December 2009, or (c) during the period from late August/early
September 2009 and April 2010, the Claimant was, in fact, aware of the statements of the Czech

Authorities to which it now refers, or that it actually relied upon them.

The Claimant did not investigate public statements before it invested in either the first project,
Tomsan, or in the second, Sluneéni. Instead, it relied upon a feasibility study from Worthald and
Partners of October 2008, as it was “actively involved in the process of selecting the most
attractive investment opportunities” in the Czech Republic. It was the consultancy firm which
actually identified which investments in solar energy production would be the most beneficial
after having “reviewed hundreds of prospective prospects”.*”” The Claimant fully relied on this
feasibility study as confirmed by one of its shareholders, Mr. Chroustovsky, who also happened
to be the managing partner of “Worthald and Parner.”** The consultants, upon which the

Claimant relied to make its investments, envisaged the ps

 

ibility of a change in the legal system

(FiT), although they still considered it “not probable” in October 2008. Nevertheless, the

 

 

consulants, i.a. Mr. Chroustovsky, in his capacity as a board member and shareholder of
SolarOne, continued to warn SolarOne and the Claimant of the risk of legislative changes in the
summor of 2009.*® For the consultants this imponderability could simply be addressed: in the
event of a change in the law, its advice was “stop project and suit [sic] Czech Republic upon
investment protection agreement”.*” There is no indication that the Claimant has done anything
more than rely on the feasibility study of its experts and their advice to claim compensation under
an investment treaty in case of legal change. Such strategy goes squarely against the allegation

that the Claimant made its investments in reliance upon relevant assurances it received from the

 

competent authorities.

Moreover, the Tax Opinion the Claimant obtained on 15 July 2009, i.e., well before the
investment in the first project, indicated that the then-applicable provisions on depreciation “may
at any time change. The prepared new act on income tax already features some stricter
provisions”.*’! Consequently, even before the investment in the first project was made, Solar One

and the Claimant as its shareholder, were warned that the subsidy regime would change.

In any event, the promotional activities, upon which the Claimant allegedly relies, contained a

warning that the legislation may change.

c) Any such reliance would not have been reasonable

Third, even if the Claimant relied on some alleged “stabilization” assurances from the Czech

Authorities — quod non — any such reliance would not have been reasonable.

In particular, the Tribunal considers that the 3 November 2008 letter from ERO, which explained
how the Incentive Regime worked, could not form the basis for a legitimate expectation one and

a half years later in a drastically changed situation.

Equally, the Tribunal does not consider that the 2009 ERO Report, which hinted that the Act on
Promotion guaranteed a long-term and stable promotion, was sufficient a basis upon which the
Claimant could form a legitimate expectation, given the legal status of this document (merely a

report from an administrative body) and the vague nature of its wording.

Further still, and as explained at some length above, the Tribunal finds that already at the relevant
times (late August/early September 2009 and April 2010) there had been an accumulation of
apparent warning signs that ought to have precluded any such expectation on the part of the
Claimant and, objectively viewed, did preclude the possibility that the Claimant might be said

reasonably to have relied on any such alleged assurances.

It was manifest in 2009-2010 that the FiT could no longer be maintained unchanged. It was clear
that, for this purpose, the 5% limitation rule would be abandoned for future plants. Moreover, it
became evident that the abolition of the 5% limitation for future plants would not, of itself, be
sufficient to address what had become an unreasonable and unsustainable support system for
plants which entered into operation in 2009 and 2010. The Tribunal therefore finds that the
Claimant was not reasonably entitled to expect that no measures would be taken with regard to
the FiT for plants in operation before 2011. The changes that were promulgated were within the

reasonable discretion of the State.

In all the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant could not have had a reasonable
or legitimate expectation concerning the continuation of the support regime without any
modification, and it could not reasonably have purported to rely on any alleged assurances to that

effect.

d) No violation of legitimate expectations because of EU law

The Tribunal observes additionally that the law of the European Union on State Aid precluded,
in any event, any legitimate expectation that plants which entered into operation in 2009-2010
would necessarily maintain the benefit of the support system as it then existed, as long as this

support system was not duly notified.

Notably the very first line of the Act on Promotion, which is the cornerstone of the solar support
regime, explicitly referred to the EU legislation, which prevails over the provisions of the Act.
Indeed, under the heading “Object of Regulation” the first line of Article 1(1) reads: “This Act
regulates, in accordance with the legislation of the European Communities, the method of
promoting the production of electricity from renewable energy sources...”. The legislation of the
European Communities includes crucial sections on competition law, among which are
provisions on State Aid. The fact that this explicit reference to the legislation of the European
Communities was accompanied by a footnote mentioning Directive 2001/77 on the promotion of
electricity produced by renewable energy sources does not alter the fact that the Act on Promotion

referred to the whole body of Community Law, including its mandatory provisions on State aid.

It is undisputed by the Parties that within each of the Member States, including, of course, the
Czech Republic, EU law forms part of the domestic law. Its mandatory rules, including its
mandatory provisions on State aid, apply therein. Moreover, it is clear that mandatory rules of

EU law have primacy over even mandatory rules of domestic law.

The argument has been made that the profits, which the Claimant would have drawn from the
production of solar electricity (in the absence of the Solar Levy or the Tax Amendments), were

prohibited under Article 107(1) of the TFEU. This provides:

any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any form whatsoever
which distorts or threatens to distort competition by favouring certain undertakings or
the production of certain goods shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States,
be incompatible with the internal market. 87”

The Tribunal, however, does not itself need to dwell on the compatibility of the support system
with the EU internal market, given that the EC, by its Decision of 28 November 2016, concluded
that the subsidies under the RES Scheme for plants commissioned between | January 2006 and
31 December 2012 constituted State aid under Article 107(3) TFEU.*” In the Tribunal’s view,
that Decision provides the authoritative answer to the detailed debate between the Parties as to

whether the EU provisions on State aid were engaged here.*”*

Relying on PreussenElektra AG v. Schleswag AG, ECJ Judgment, Case C-378/98, 13 March 2001 (Ex.

constitute State aid within the meaning and scope of Article 107(1) TFEU where the advantage in question
is not financed through State resources but is instead financed by private undertakings pursuant to a
purchase obligation imposed by the State”, The Claimant alleged that this principle had not been overruled
by subsequent cases. With respect to the RES support scheme set out in the original Act on Promotion, the

For the present case, it is also irrelevant that the EC decided in 2016 that — at that time — the
return yielded by the solar support regime, based upon the Act on Promotion, but corrected by a
Solar Levy of 26% for the years 2011-2013 and 10% as of 2014, had brought the return back to
a reasonable level, so that the support was no longer illegal State aid under EU law. The enquiry
for present purposes concerns the period before this, in 2009-2010. Nor is it significant that the
Decision did not spell out in express terms that the solar support regime without the Solar Levy

would, on the contrary, constitute illegal aid.*”

Further still, as will be apparent from the discussion below, the question whether the support
regime, if State aid, would be exempted under Article 108 TFEU (again an issue much debated

by the Parties) is immaterial for the present case.

The basic rule with regard to State aid under EU law is that State aid is only permitted when it
has been approved by the EC. As summarized by Ms. Bacon in her First Expert Report, it is “very
well established that, in principle, undertakings to which aid has been granted may not entertain

any legitimate expectation that is lawful, unless it has been granted in accordance with the

Claimant explained that the original funding scheme did not involve any transfer of State resources because
the legislation required the grid operators to pay both the FiT and the Green Bonuses from their own private
budget. With respect to the new RES support scheme introduced by Act No. 402/2010 and the 2013 New
Act on Promotion, the Claimant argued as follows: First, the Claimant did not make its investment under
these new schemes, therefore their compliance with EU law is irrelevant to the present case. Second, the
new funding mechanism did not involve State resources. With respect to Act No. 402/2010, which
introduced the Solar Levy, the Claimant alleged that “even if the amendments introduced by Act No.
42/2010 entailed State aid, such aid would in any event not be granted to solar producers” since the
resources from the levy were paid to transmission and grid system operators.

The Respondent, from its side, observed that the law regarding EU State aid rules for RES schemes has
developed since the famous decision in PreussenElektra, which is applicable when “the purchase
obligation in question was financed entirely from the private resources of the grid operators themselves”
(Rejoinder, para. 292; Counter-Memorial, para. 282, referring to Essent Netwerk Noord, ECJ Judgment,
Case C-206/06, 17 July 2008 (Ex. RLA-70); Association Vent De Colere!, ECJ Judgment, Case C-262/12,

Union, Case T-251/11, 18 May 2011 (Ex. RLA-72); Counter-Memorial, paras. 274-284; Rejoinder, paras.
291-293). The Respondent further referred to the EC’s January 2014 Draft Notice on the Notion of State
aid, which comprehensively reflects the EC’s current position on public support schemes (Counter-
Memorial, para. 283, referring to Draft Commission Notice on the notion of State aid pursuant to Article
107(1) TFEU, 17 January 2014, para. 66 (Ex. RLA-73). This Draft Notice provides as follows: surcharges
imposed by law on private persons can be qualified as State resources. It is the case even where a private
company is appointed by law to collect such charges on behalf of the State and to channel them to the
beneficiaries, without allowing the collecting company to use the proceeds from the charges for purposes
other than those provided for by the law. In this case, the sums in question remain under public control and
are therefore available to the national authorities, which is sufficient reason for them to be considered State
resources.

procedure set out in Article. 108 TFEU.”*”°

Consequently, the relevant question is whether, at the time the investment was made, the EC had,
upon due notification, positively decided that the solar support regime was compatible with EU
law. In the absence of due notification and any such decision, the investor — as in the present case
— was not entitled to hold any legitimate expectations that the un-notified support system would
not be changed. The Tribunal is aware that the Czech Republic had stated in the Explanatory
Report of November 2003 that the future Act on Promotion would be “compatible with the public
aid law of the European Union”.'” The Republic repeated that view in a few instances up to
2009. However, statements from domestic authorities cannot give rise to legitimate expectations
when they are counter to mandatory EU law. In its 2016 Decision, the EC formally confirmed
that the Incentive Regime, as applicable to installations commissioned between 1 January 2006
and 31 December 2012, constituted State aid. Statements from domestic authorities cannot alter
this. Given that it is not for a Member State to declare its own aid schemes compatible with EU

law, any such declaration cannot be a basis for a legitimate expectation.

Neither can legitimate expectations be based upon the letter of 27 July 2004 from the EC (the
“27 July 2004 Letter”), which was written in response to a complaint of 16 December 2003 from
the Czech Society of Wind Energy and EUROSOLAR. In that letter, the EC stated — on the basis
of the 2003 draft of the Act — that incentives under the Act on Promotion did not constitute State

aid because the Investment Regime did not involve State resources.'”*

The Claimant argues that the 27 July 2004 Letter was a sufficient basis for its legitimate
expectations.*” An EC decision can create legitimate expectations, even if it does not address
specific individuals as long as the decision is widely disseminated and known.** In the present
case, the decision was widely disseminated and known, because it was sent to the two main
industry associations in the RES sector, ie., the Czech Society of Wind Energy and
EUROSOLAR.**' Referring to Athinaiki Techniki v Commission, the Claimant further submits

that the Court of Justice of the European Union has held that the EC’s letter by which it decided
that there was no breach of EU law and that no further investigations would be conducted,

amounts to a formal decision on which the Claimant can rely.**?

According to the Claimant:

The right to rely on the principle of legitimate expectations constitutes one of the
fundamental principles of EU State aid law. It extends to any person who is ina situation
in which it is clear that the EU authorities have, by giving precise assurances, led him to
entertain legitimate expectations. Regardless of the form in which it is communicated,
information that is precise, unconditional and consistent and comes from an authorised
and reliable source constitutes such assurance. *

The Respondent denies that the Claimant could have had legitimate expectations as to the
compatibility of the Respondent’s incentive scheme with EU State aid law.*** According to the
Respondent, such legitimate expectations may only arise if “precise, unconditional and
consistent assurances originating from authorised, reliable sources [were] given to the person

concerned by the competent authorities of the European Union”.

Contrary to the Claimant’s
argument, the Respondent maintains that the EC’s 27 July 2004 Letter was insufficient to create
legitimate expectations.**° The 27 July 2004 Letter only addressed a 2003 draft (on the basis of
information provided by EUROSOLAR) which differed substantially from the 2005 Act on
Promotion. Neither the draft, nor the information provided by EUROSOLAR explained — nor
indeed could have explained — the precise funding mechanism of the RES Scheme and the amount

of the FiT. They were, after all, only put in place in 2005.”

Moreover, the 27 July 2004 Letter was not intended to bring an end to the investigation. Nor did
it constitute a formal decision.*** To this end, the decision of the Court of Justice in Athinaiki*”

is to be distinguished, since in that case it was held that a letter issued by the EC, which did, in

fact, close the file on a complaint, constituted a formal decision.*” Furthermore, the EC was
entitled to change its initial assessment, which was based on the reasoning in PreussenElektra,
in light of subsequent developments in European case law after 2004." Finally, according to the
Respondent, the Claimant did not directly rely on the 27 July 2004 Letter in any event.’” In
response to the Claimant’s allegation that it “relied on the [27] July 2004 Letter indirectly,
because that letter was ‘relied on by the Respondent’’ in, for example, the drafting of the
Explanatory Report on the Act on Promotion, the Respondent notes that the Explanatory Report

was drafted nine months before the 27 July 2004 Letter.

With regard to the EC’s subsequent enquires, it is the Respondent’s position that the EC did not
take any formal decision by which it would be bound in respect of the applicability of the State
aid rule on the Incentive Regime.*™ Hence, when it confirmed that the exemption of “ecological
tax” did not amount to State aid in a different case, the EC expressly noted that such a decision

did not bind its future position.*”*

The Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent’s analysis on this issue. The Tribunal does not
consider that the 27 July 2004 Letter constitutes a basis for legitimate expectations, since it
addressed no more than a legislative draft, and it did so in response to a general complaint from
professional organisations that the envisaged act would favour particular energy producers and
state companies.*”* For the purposes of its analysis, the EC did not have — and could not have had
— information about the exact funding mechanism of the RES Scheme and the amount of the FiT,
as these modalities were only put in place in 2005.**” Moreover, by definition, the decision of the
EC with respect to a draft of possible future legislation could only be preliminary. The provisional
scope of the 27 July 2004 Letter is well illustrated by its last paragraph: “Should you learn of any
new particulars that might demonstrate the existence of an infringement of the State aid rules, I

would be grateful if you would inform my department as soon as possible”*’ In all the

circumstances, it is clear that the EC did not intend to render a final and binding decision on the
future Act on Promotion on the basis of the limited information it had received with regard to the
2003 draft of that law. And as held by the Court of Justice in the Athinai

Decision by the EC would require an intention on its part to state a definitive position.

   

judgment, a formal

It follows that, in the Tribunal’s view, the 27 July 2004 Letter was not a Decision. Furthermore,
even if it could be construed as such in 2004 when it was rendered, under the Athinaiki judgment,
this still does not mean that the Decision could have given rise to legitimate expectations in 2009
or 2010. As was pointed out in the Athinaiki judgment, the Decision would only remain
applicable for so long as no new information became available.*” Here, new and significant
information did become available after 2004 (namely the final text of the Act on Promotion and

the specific financial incentives thereby established).

 

Given the Tribunal’s conclusion that the 27 July 2004 Letter and other statements discussed
above could not have led to legitimate expectations, there is no need for the Tribunal to inquire
into the question of reasonable reliance by the Claimant upon the matters in question when it

made its investment.

In summary, when the investments were made, the Incentive Regime, although State aid, had not
been notified to, and approved by, the EC. Under EU law, it therefore follows that as at that time,

there could not have been any legitimate expectations as alleged by the Claimant.

(3) Transparency

In a third step, the Tribunal must next consider whether the Respondent breached its obligation

towards the Claimant to act in a transparent manner.

It is clear that the FET standard entails a transparency component — as confirmed by the text of

Article 10(1) of the ECT, which refers in terms to “transparent conditions for Investors”.

The concept of transparency is closely related to an investor’s legitimate expectations. Dolzer
and Schreuer define transparency as follows: “Transparency means that the legal framework for
the investor’s operations is readily apparent and that any decisions affecting the investor can be
traced back to that legal framework.” In addition, the Tribunal considers that transparency must
include a requirement that information about relevant changes in the investment framework are

communicated well in advance.

As noted above, it is the investor’s expectations at the time of the investment that are relevant for
the Tribunal’s assessment, i.e., in the period between 27 August to 7 September 2009 for the

Tomsan investment and in April 2010 for the Sluneéni investment.”

The possibility that a Solar Levy would be introduced by 1 January 2011 was considered on 23
July 2010°” and was formally announced on 20 October 2010." As noted earlier in this Award,
the Tribunal has no doubt that it was already obvious at the time of the investment that the sharp
increase in the number of PV power plants connecting to the grid would lead to a crisis. Because
of the rush of new investments made in the PV sector in the last months of 2010, the introduction
of measures as of 2011 became an inevitability. On the other hand, investors knew that the
caretaker government that was in place in the Czech Republic at that time would not take
substantial policy decisions as it did not have the necessary political support. Parliamentary
elections were substantially delayed. A viable and politically sustainable government was only
established in July 2010.

Considering (1) that there was an obvious and transparent need for the Incentive Regime to be
changed; (2) that there was a political vacuum until July 2010; and (3) the dramatic increase of
PV plant grid connections in the last months of 2010, the Tribunal holds that the Czech Republic

was as transparent as it could have been in the circumstances.

In all the circumstances, as detailed earlier in this Award, the Tribunal therefore does not consider

that the Respondent violated its obligation under the FET standard to act in a transparent manner.

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED THE OBLIGATION TO GRANT FULL PROTECTION
AND SECURITY

1. The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached its obligation to grant full protection and
security (“FPS”) by introducing the Solar Levy and repealing the Tax Exemption and the
Shortened Depreciation Period.™ The obligation to provide FPS is contained in Article 10(1) of
the ECT."

The Parties agree that a guarantee of “constant” or “full” protection and security is afforded to
foreign investments under Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Parties also agree that the legal test as
to whether a violation of this standard has occurred in the present case largely overlaps with the
test applicable to violations of the FET standard. This is because the Claimant puts its case in
terms of the “legal”, and not the “physical”, dimension of the FPS standard as interpreted by
international tribunals, which it has articulated in terms of the host country’s obligation to

guarantee a secure and stable investment environment to protect foreign investments.

 

Given the overlap in standards, the Tribunal refers simply to its earlier analysis. For the reasons
that have been fully explored above in the context of the FET standard, the Tribunal finds that no

violation of the FPS standard has occurred in this case.

WHETHER THE RESPONDENT VIOLATED THE PROHIBITION OF IMPAIRMENT THROUGH
ARBITRARY AND DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT

1. Whether the Claimant’s Investment was Significantly Impaired by the Respondent’s
Measures

(a) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues that the Respondent violated the prohibition of arbitrary and discriminatory
treatment (“Non-Impairment Standard”) contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT by acting in an

unreasonable and inconsistent manner.”!*
Article 10(1) of the ECT provides:

[...] no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures the] use, enj or disposal [of of
Investors of other Contracting Parties] [...]

In response to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimant’s investment was not significantly

916

impaired, the Claimant, relying on the tribunal’s decision in Saluka,’'° suggests that any negative

impact on investment is sufficient to constitute an impairment.”

In the present case, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s amendment measures had a

material effect upon the SolarOne’s profitability. SolarOne’s value suffered a significant drop,

and the Claimant lost the opportunity to sell its shareholding in SolarOne.”"*

(b) The Respondents Position
The Respondent argues that the amendment measures were reasonable and appropriate and that
therefore they do not amount to a violation of the Non-Impairment Standard.’!? The Respondent
rejects the Claimant’s argument that any negative effects on investments, however minor, satisfy
the impairment requirement.” In the Respondent’s view, the impairment must be “significant”
before it can amount to a violation of the treaty standard.”"' A mere imposition of tax measures

or a simple repeal of a tax exemption is not sufficient to satisfy this requirement.”

The Respondent alleges that the Claimant fails to establish any such significant impact.°* The
Claimant “was free to use the solar power plants to generate substantial revenue” even after the

ction of the d °°4 The Respondent also points out that the Claimant’s

Measures.” In addition, the Respondent submits that the Claimant received a share purchase

offer in relation to SolarOne.”*

Finally, the Respondent asserts that the impairment, according to the text of the treaty, must be

related to the “management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of the purported
29 927

investment”, ~’ and that the Claimant has not provided evidence for any such relationship. Rather,

it has focussed solely on the alleged diminution of the plant’s value.”

2. Whether the Respondent’s Measures were Arbitrary or Discriminatory
(a) Whether the Respondent Pursued a Rational Policy
(1) ~~ The Claimant’s Position
The Claimant submits that in order to establish a violation of the Non-Impairment Standard, the
Tribunal should apply a “means-to-an-end” reasonableness test to analyse the reasonableness of
the Respondent’s measures: a State’s measure is reasonable if (1) the State pursues a rational

policy; and (2) the State acts in a reasonable manner when implementing the policy.”””

Relying on AES,” the Claimant explains that (1) a policy is rational “if it is taken ‘following a
logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter’”; and
(2) an implementation measure is reasonable “if there is ‘an appropriate correlation between the

a5 931

state’s policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve it

In relation to the first prong of the reasonableness test, the Claimant rejects the argument that,

  

since the purpose of the adopted measures was to eliminate excess

 

ve profits and to relieve
consumers and the State budget of an additional burden, the Respondent pursued a rational policy.

This is for a number of reasons.”

First, the Claimant alleges that the Incentive Regime did not give rise to windfall profits.” The
photovoltaic investors only received a 10-15% return, which is consistent with return rates in
other EU markets.°™ In this vein, the Claimant emphasizes that the explanatory report on Act No.

402/2010 Coll., which introduced the Solar Levy, did not speak in terms of windfall profits.”

Second, according to the Claimant, since “the Respondent facially destroyed the Claimant’s
rights and interests”, the Respondent has to prove that “the maintenance of the Incentive Regime,
and the allegedly resulting high electricity prices, would have entailed the catastrophic
consequences for the Czech economy”, in order to demonstrate the rationality of its policy.”

However, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has not shown that any specific harm existed

at the time of the adoption of the measures.”*’ On the contrary, the extra cost per unit for RES
support, and the growth in electricity tariffs and electricity prices were low in the Czech Republic
when the amendment measures were adopted.”** Industrial production in the Czech Republic was
growing in 2010.°” The budget deficits of the Czech Republic were at the lowest level among
the EU Member States.“ The Claimant also notes that host States may not intervene in, or
interfere with, private investments “simply in the name of purported threats of its national

economy”.*4!

Third, according to the Claimant, the Respondent’s policy was not rational as there was no urgent
need to change the Incentive Regime, on which the Claimant relied, before the EC had
intervened.” In support of this argument, the Claimant relies on the award in AES," in which
the tribunal found that Hungary was not obliged to limit potential State aid before the EC issued
its decision.“ In the Claimant’s view, Professor Stern’s dissent in AES is not pertinent in the

present case, as the EC did not put pressure on the Czech Government in the case at hand.**

Fourth, the Claimant contends that the Respondent’s policy retroactively to withdraw the
promised profits led to the Czech Government losing its international reputation as a profitable
destination for foreign investment.” This is further proof of the irrationality of the Respondent’s
policy, because without foreign investment the Respondent will likely fail to meet the EU’s 2020

target, by which it is still bound. °“”

Fifth, the Claimant adds that if there were any alleged windfall profits, they were caused by the
Respondent’s policy choice to enact the Incentive Regime and the Respondent’s failure to

calculate the relevant costs properly.“

(2) The Respondent’s Position
According to the Respondent, a measure is reasonable, if it is reasonably connected to a rational
policy. The Respondent notes that the general presumption is that a State’s exercise of its
regulatory power will be reasonable and that this test does not require or, in fact, entitle the

Tribunal to second guess a State’s policy or a measure that it seeks to introduce.”*”

The Respondent submits that a host State’s policy is rational “if it has been adopted “following a
logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter.””°*! In
this regard, the Respondent objects to the Claimants allegation that the Respondent must prove
that “the Incentive Regime [...] would have entailed [...] catastrophic consequences for the
Czech economy”, alleging that no tribunal has requested a host State to prove that “near-
calamitous consequences would have occurred, but for the State’s intervention.” °° The
Respondent also notes that tribunals have found a broad variety of policy objections to be
“rational”, including “the protection of consumers, accession to the European Union, and

regulation of the windfall gains of a certain sector.”°*?

With respect to the amendments to the Act on Income Tax, the Respondent argues that the repeal

of the Income Tax Exemption and the change of the Shortened Depreciation Period were based

 

on the desire to protect the State budget in the midst of a global economic crisis.” With regard
to the Solar Levy, the Respondent alleges that it introduced the Solar Levy, together with the
State budget subsidy, in order to alleviate the excessive burden on consumers by transferring
some of that burden to the excessively profitable photovoltaic producers.’® In this regard, the
Claimant’s argument that the solar boom did not impose an unsustainable burden on consumers
is unreasonable, because (1) consumers in the Czech Republic were paying a higher proportion
of their income on electricity than consumers in other EU States; (2) the Czech Republic’s
support per unit of RES generation was the highest among the EU Member States; and (3) the

Czech Republic spent a significant share, i.e., more than 0.5%, of State budget for photovoltaic

support.?°°

In response to the Claimant’s argument that the rate of return in the Czech Republic was
consistent with that in other EU Member States, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant’s
comparison of WACC figures in the EU Member States is misleading, because (1) the Claimant
confuses post-tax and pre-tax rates; and (2) the Claimant does not distinguish between forms of

support systems.°*”

(b) Whether the Respondent Acted in a Reasonable Manner When Implementing
the Policy

(1) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant argues, further, that the Respondent acted in an unreasonable manner when
implementing the policy, stating that a host State’s measure can be reasonable only when (1) “its
adverse effects on foreign investments are limited to what is strictly necessary to achieve the
public interest”; and (2) “the public interest outweighs the negative impact on the rights of foreign
investors in the specific case.”°** In the present case, the Claimant argues that the contested

measures do not satisfy either of these requirements.°”

The Claimant argues that the Solar Levy did not correct the increase of electricity prices, because
it served only modestly to reduce electricity bills by 3.6% for private households and 4.3% for
medium size industries.* With respect to the repeal of the Income Tax Exemption and the
change to the Shortened Depreciation Period, the Claimant states that the Respondent does not
sufficiently explain how these measures were meant to address the rise in electricity prices. °°!
On the other hand, in the Claimant’s view, the measures had significantly negative effects on
photovoltaic investors. For example, and most relevant to this case, the sale of the Claimant’s

plant became impossible after the measures were introduced.°

the retroactive measures to deal with the solar boom.°~ The Claimant argues that the

Respondents retroactive changes to the Incentive Regime constituted bad regulatory practice

which could have been avoided if the Respondent had followed the path taken by at least eight

other EU Member States, i.e., by addressing the solar boom with measures that apply only to

future investments.*® In this vein, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s “retroactive”

measures were criticized by the EC, citing the EC’s letter to the Czech Ministry of Industry and
Trade of 11 January 2011.°°°

(2) The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, a measure is reasonable if the measure is “appropriately tailored”
to meet the policy.’ The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s burden to prove a violation of
the Non-Impairment Standard is particularly high, because of “a presumption of validity in favour
of legislative measures adopted by a State.”” In addition, the Respondent submits that tribunals
in other cases, in which fiscal legislation that was aimed at the elimination of windfall profits

played a role, have found the measures to be reasonable.”

The Respondent submits that the reasonableness test should be distinguished from a balance test
and that, to establish a reasonable relationship, the benefits derived by a host State from a measure
do not need to outweigh the negative impact on investors.”” The Respondent also notes that the
“appropriate tailoring” requirement is not a strict scrutiny test and that State measures do not
need to be strictly necessary for the pursuance of the policy to qualify under the test.°7!

In the instant case, the Respondent states that the amendment measures were meant to address

negative impacts arising out of the unanticipated increase of solar investments in the middle of

the financial crisis.°” To address this problem, the Czech authorities (1) allowed investors to
receive a reasonable rate of return; (2) imposed a tax on excessive returns; (3) levelled the playing
field for all RES producers; (4) levelled the playing field for overly profitable PV producers; and
(5) offered a tax deferral to photovoltaic producers faced with a serious financial risk.” These

measures were implemented to correct good faith mistakes in the design of the original scheme.”

The Respondent argues that the Solar Levy was meant to mitigate the negative impact on the
State budget caused by the installation of solar power plants and to allow photovoltaic investors
to continue to enjoy the expected benefits of the 15-year simple payback and the 7% return rate.””*
The Tax Exemption was not economically justifiable, because, without it, the photovoltaic
installations were still sufficiently profitable and the 2010 EU target was achievable.°”° The

Shortened Depreciation Period was not originally designed specifically to support solar power

 

producers, since solar panels were originally categorized as an unclassified asset in the residual

  

category.°” The changes to the depreciation period were intended to address an abuse of the

measure by PV investors.°”

To support its view, the Respondent submits that Czech domestic courts have confirmed that the
amendment measures served the public interest.°” Furthermore, the Respondent alleges that the
Taxation Measures only targeted photovoltaic energy producers, which received imbalanced
excess profits in relation to the dropped installation costs.”*” In the Respondent's view, these solar

producers should have been aware of the possibility of modifications in the investment scheme.”*!

unreasonable.” On the contrary, the Respondent submits that the measures were economically
effective and that other EU Member States adopted comparable measures.“ In this regard, the
Respondent emphasizes that EU Member States had little experience of support for the
photovoltaic sector and therefore managing the photovoltaic sector was difficult.°** Moreover,
the Respondent notes that the novelty of a measure is irrelevant to the reasonableness analysis.”**
The Respondent also reiterates that the Tribunal is not in a position to second guess whether the

987

measures could have been better designed.”*° Referring to Mesa Power,’*’ the Respondent further

submits that the mere fact that a measure taken by a State does not achieve its intended objectives

does not make the measure unreasonable.”

Finally, the Respondent submits that legislation does not become unreasonable simply because
States enact it quickly. In any event, the Respondent states that it carefully tailored the
amendment measures with the benefit of the work of an inter-ministerial committee, through
commissioning studies and by review in parliamentary sessions.”” In addition, the Respondent
points out that the Claimant argues on the one hand that the Respondent should have reacted to
the solar boom quickly, while, on the other hand, it states in the present context that the
Respondent should have devoted more time to the consideration of the measures before enacting

especially when, as here, the Respondent first promised a long-term incentive regime to meet a

certain policy goal, and then repealed the promised incentive in relation to existing investors.”

In addition, the Claimant argues that the Respondent’s measures were irrational, because they
changed the fundamental features of the Incentive Regime.™ In support of its argument, the

°°. that “the existence of a

Claimant relies on the general principle articulated in Charanne
guaranteed tariff throughout the lifetime of the facility is an essential characteristic of an incentive
regime.”°" The Claimant contends, however, that the actual conclusion of the tribunal in
Charanne does not apply to the present case, since the claimants in Charanne invoked an
unreasonably long 30-50 years guarantee period, and the tribunal in that case emphasized that the

decision was based on case specific circumstances.”

(b) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that the Taxation Measures are unreasonable,
because they had the effect of withdrawing the promised incentives.”* According to the
Respondent, a breach of a promise, in the absence of other aggravating circumstances between a

host State and the investor(s), is not per se unreasonable.”

The Respondent argues that the Solar Levy did not repeal the fundamental features of the
Incentive Scheme, because the Scheme was not meant to stabilize the FiT level and therefore the
FiT level itself did not constitute a fundamental feature of it. Furthermore, the Claimant has still
been receiving the FiT.' The Respondent relies on the decision of the Czech Constitutional
Court, which concluded that the Solar Levy did not alter the RES scheme.'°"

In addition, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not provided any evidence to support
its position that the amendment measures were part of a pre-planned mechanism by which the

Respondent repealed the incentives, once it became likely it would achieve the 8% Indicative

4, Whether the Respondent Acted in an Inconsistent Manner
(a) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent acted in an inconsistent manner in relation to

statements given to investors and in respect of its ultimate policy goal.'°°

In relation to investors, the Respondent first announced that the regime changes would only apply
to new investments made on or after 1 January 2011, but eventually it applied it to all investments
made between | January 2009 and 31 December 2010.'™ With respect to the policy goal, the
Respondent first attempted to achieve its EU target for both the years 2010 and 2020, 8% and
13% respectively. '°°’ However, the Respondent’s retroactive measures then made it impossible
to achieve the 2020 goal, because the Respondent lost international credibility after the

amendment measures.'*

Wrongful Acts 2001 provides that a State cannot invoke the necessity defence, if it “has
contributed to the situation of necessity” and that this general rule should apply in the present

case, '""°

In the Claimant’s view, the Act on Promotion, especially the 5% rule, cannot be regarded as a
good faith mistake; rather it was the Respondent’s active policy choice to attract investors. '°"!
Since the Respondent was well aware in October 2009 that a significant number of photovoltaic
power plants would be installed in 2010, it had enough time to react promptly and to issue a
warning to discourage prospective investors, such that retroactive changes to the Incentive
Scheme would not have become necessary. '"* As support for this, the Claimant submits that Mr.
Jones, the Respondent’s expert, accepted that it was “relatively easy to estimate” the costs on
consumers and that the Czech Technical University predicted a drop of installation costs by more
than 50%.'°"? Rather, in the Claimant’s view, the Respondent used the rapid increase in the

installation of solar plants in order to meet the 8% Indicative 2010 Target.'°!*

Respondent’s mismanagement. '°!

The Respondent submits that the rapid increase of solar installations was unpredictable, given
the novelty of the photovoltaic technology and the dramatic fall in the cost of the photovoltaic
module.'"'®

The Respondent alleges that it reacted to the solar boom in a practical and timely manner, stating

sufficient data before imposing it.'°'* In the Respondent’s view, photovoltaic energy investors
rushed into the market to take advantage of the 5% rule when it became known that the Czech

Government was considering its abolition.'°””

In any event, the Respondent notes that the Claimant’s reference to Article 25(2)(b) of the Draft
Articles on State Responsibility is misplaced, because the Respondent has not invoked the

necessity defence. !°”°

6. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Parties are divided as to whether the Respondent’s withdrawal of the Tax Incentives and the
introduction of the Solar Levy amount to violations of the prohibition of arbitrary and

discriminatory treatment.

As a preliminary matter, there is considerable disagreement between the Parties as to whether the
impairment in question was “significant” enough for a violation of the treaty standard or whether
any negative impact on foreign investment, whatever its magnitude, is sufficient to constitute an
actionable treaty violation. In the Tribunal’s view, an impairment needs to be substantial in order
to constitute a treaty breach. This proposition, however, need not be developed here, since, in the
Tribunal’s view, the determinative question is not whether the impairment was substantial, but
whether the challenged measures were promulgated in pursuit of a rational policy and were

implemented in a reasonable manner.

The Parties seem to agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that the relevant test to assess the rationality
of a policy is that cogently articulated by the tribunal in AES as follows: “A rational policy is
taken by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a
public interest matter.”'°”' In addition, the challenged measure must also be reasonable. As
stipulated by the tribunal in AES in words with which the Tribunal is in full agreement, “an
appropriate correlation between the state’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to

In essence, the Respondent has argued that the amendments relating to taxation were motivated

by the State’s desire to safeguard the State budget in the midst of a global economic crisis. The

Solar Levy was introduced, together with a State budget subsidy, to lower a perceived excessive
burden caused by energy costs on consumers and to share it with what the Respondent considered

(and i ) to be

 

electricity p

Pp P

The Tribunal finds that a “balancing” policy whereby electricity prices are lowered for the benefit
of the general public and there is an equivalent diminution in excessive profits of PV investors,
such that an excessive burden put on consumers might be alleviated, qualifies as a rational policy
within the meaning of the above-referenced definition. Having carefully considered all the
circumstances, the Tribunal finds the Respondent’s explanation plausible. It concludes that the

challenged measures were clearly aimed at addressing a public interest matter.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent also acted in a reasonable manner when implementing
the challenged measures. First, the Tribunal notes that it was expected that the FiT would be
reduced by 30% in 2011 once the 5% break out rule was abolished. In this context, a Solar Levy
for existing plants of 26% is certainly reasonable. More importantly, even after the Solar Levy
reduced excessive profits, a reasonable return remained available for PV investors. In 2009,
without the legislative amendments, the reference plant would have received a full payback in
9.5 years. Following the amendments, a payback could still be achieved in 11 years, and therefore

well below the promised 15 years.'°*

In 2010, without the legislative amendments, the reference
plant would have received a full payback in 7.8 years. Following the amendments, a payback
could still be achieved in 9.9 years, and therefore also well below the promised 15 years.'°* The
return for the reference plant without amendments would have been 8.4% in 2009 and 11.4% in
2010, while the return with the amendments amounted to 7% in 2009 and 8.4% in 2010, and
therefore exactly in line with or well above the promised 7% return rate.'°* In other words,
despite the amendment measures, PV investments were as profitable — and in fact more profitable
— than promised. Put shortly, the Solar Levy, contrary to the Claimant’s argument, did not
undermine the fundamental features of the Incentive Scheme. The Incentive Scheme guaranteed
that eligible solar PV plants could expect a FiT that allowed a 15-year payback and a 7% rate of

return over a period of 15 years. The Respondent did not breach these promises.
In this context, it is also worth noting that while the return for the reference plant decreased by

First Peer Report, para. 4.8.1: the pay back for the Claimant would have been without amendments 6.6
years and was 8 years with amendments, ie., also well below the promised 15 years.

First Peer Report, para. 4.8.1: the pay back for the Claimant would have been without amendments 7.8
years and was 10.1 years with amendments, i.e., also well below the promised 15 years.

First Peer Report, para. 4.8.3: The return for the Claimant would have been 14.4% without amendments
and was 8% with amendments in 2009, and would have been 11.5% and was 8.2% in 2010, i.e., also well
above the promised 7% return rate. All measures together reduced the return for the 2009 reference plant
from 8.4% to 7%, Hearing Transcript (2 March 2017), 230:8-18.

3%, electricity bills decreased by 3.6% for private households and 44.3% for medium industries.

As a consequence, PV producers lost rather less, comparatively, than electricity consumers won.

For the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that neither the introduction of the Solar Levy, nor
the withdrawal of the Tax Incentives was unreasonable or arbitrary in the given circumstances.
Whether, with the benefit of hindsight, there might have been a better way to address the
problems caused by the rapid increase in the number of solar installations in the Czech Republic
and the ensuing rise in electricity prices, is not a matter for the Tribunal to decide, but it is an

issue that falls within a State’s legislative discretion.

Having considered all materials and submissions before it, the Tribunal therefore concludes that
the challenged measures did not impair the Claimant’s investment in an arbitrary or

discriminatory manner.

COSTS

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

The Claimant submits that its total costs amount to EUR 502,986.09, which includes the
arbitration deposit of EUR 100,000.00 to date.'”°

The Claimant posits three different scenarios for the outcome of the arbitration, which would
have an impact on the allocation of costs. According to the Claimant:
(i) in the event that the Claimant prevails on the merits (Scenario 1), it should be awarded

the costs of this arbitration, including the “costs of legal representation and assistance”
pursuant to Article 38(e) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Rules;

(ii) in the event that the Claimant prevails on jurisdiction, but not on the merits (Scenario
2), the Claimant should be awarded the costs of this arbitration, including the “costs of
legal representation and assistance”, relating to the Respondent’s objections to the
jurisdiction, but it should not bear any of the Respondent's costs relating to the merits,
because the claim is a bona fide claim, raising complex issues, while the Respondent
delayed and hindered the adjudication of the dispute; and

(iii) in the event that the Respondent prevails on jurisdiction (Scenario 3), it is nonetheless
reasonable that the Claimant should not bear any of the Respondent’s costs (including
the Respondent's costs for legal representation and assistance), because the claim is a
bona fide claim, raising complex issues, while the Respondent delayed and hindered the
adjudication of the dispute. !°27
The Claimant recalls that the principles with respect to the allocation of costs in the present
arbitration are set out in Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.'** As for the costs of the
arbitration, Article 40(1) contains the general rule that “costs follow the event”, pursuant to which
a losing party bears the costs, but which also allows the arbitral tribunal to employ a different
approach, taking into account “the circumstance of the case”.' As for the costs of legal
representation, Article 40(2) provides the tribunal a broader discretion to decide the allocation of
the costs.'°°
In scenario 1, the Claimant submits that the Respondent should bear both the costs of arbitration

and the costs of legal representation and assistance of the Claimant.'°' For the costs of

arbitration, this follows from the “costs follow the event” rule.'°? As for the costs of legal
representation, the Claimant alleges that an application of the “cost follow the event” rule would
also be appropriate considering the circumstance of the case.'°* While the Claimant says that it
submitted bona fide claims and adopted cost-effective approaches, the Respondent unnecessarily
increased the Claimant’s costs by refusing the adjudication of the claims in a single consolidated
arbitration; provoking the EC’s investigation of the Incentive Regime in relation to plants
connected before 2013; and by including jurisdictional arguments in its Rejoinder submission in
breach of the procedural timetable.'"* Moreover, since quantum constituted only a small portion
of the entire arguments, whether the entirety, or only a portion, of the damages claimed were
awarded would be irrelevant to the cost allocation.'°** In addition, the Claimant bore the burden
of proof regarding several novel and complex issues for which no precedent existed.'°° The
Respondent must also bear the costs of the Achmea phase, given that the jurisdictional objection
was raised at a late stage in the proceedings.'”” Finally, the Respondent must bear the costs

associated with the unsuccessful challenge to Mr. Beechey.'°**

In scenario 2, the Claimant should be awarded its costs relating to the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections and should not bear the Respondent’s costs on the merits.'°° The “costs follow the
event” rule applies to both non-legal and legal costs as it does in scenario 1, as the Claimant
would be the prevailing party on jurisdiction.'"° With regard to the merits, the Claimant submits
that the circumstances of the case warrant a departure from the “cost follows the event” principle.
For example, while the Claimant’s claims were bona fide, the Respondent obstructed the
proceeding by, inter alia, “raising overly complex — but totally unhelpful — EU State Aid law

defenses.”!!

Claimant alleges that the “costs follow the event” rule should not be applied by the Tribunal,

given the procedural behaviour of the Parties more fully described above.'“?

The Claimant submits that its legal costs are reasonable pursuant to Article 38(e) of the
UNCITRAL Rules.'“4 The Claimant alleges that it “ran the case with a small legal team, relied
on expert evidence only where strictly necessary, and divided essentially all costs with the other
nine claimants.”!** The Claimant adds that if the Respondent’s legal costs exceed those of the

Claimant, any excess amount would be unreasonable.'

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent requests that should it prevail in the arbitration, the Tribunal order the Claimant
to pay all of the Czech Republic’s costs and expenses incurred in connection with this proceeding
(including attorney fees and expenses), in the amount of USD 1,246,817, as well as the Czech
Republic’s share of the costs incurred by the Tribunal and the PCA, in the amount of EUR
100,000 to date.'°7

The Respondent has divided its costs and expenses equally among PCA Cases 2014-19, 2014-
20, 2014-21 and 2014-22, estimating “that the share of costs devoted to each of these matters has

been roughly equal.”!*

According to the Respondent, the costs of the arbitration should be allocated on the basis of the
“loser pays” or “costs follow the event” principle pursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL
Rules. Accordingly, the Tribunal should issue “an award of reasonable costs in favour of the
prevailing party”. '“? With respect to the costs of legal representation, the Respondent
acknowledges that Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules “confers on the Tribunal broad
discretion to determine any reasonable apportionment of such costs in light of the circumstances

of the case”.'°°°

also to the costs of legal representation despite the difference in wording between Articles 40(1)
and (2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. It refers the Tribunal to the decision in ECE
Projektmanagement GmbH et al. v. The Czech Republic, which ruled that “the relevant criteria
are in both cases essentially the same, and include in both cases the extent to which the successful
party has succeeded on the principal question in issue in the dispute.”"”’' The Respondent further
alleges that the application of the “loser pays” principle “is not limited to the context of ‘abusive’

or ‘frivolous’ claims.”!°?

Under the “loser pays” rule, a party may be considered the “prevailing party” if it “has prevailed
on all or only some of the issues in the case, i.e., that party’s ‘relative success’”.'°? The concept
of “relative success” should only be employed, however, if “a tribunal has genuine difficulty in
identifying the prevailing party.”'°™ Based on this understanding, the Respondent considers that
it would be the “prevailing party”, if it “defeated all of the claims (whether on merits or
jurisdiction)”.'°* In such case, so argues the Respondent, it “should be awarded most or all of its

reasonable costs”.'°°°

The Respondent emphasises that the Tribunal may depart from the “loser pays” principle in
situations where a prevailing party “caused an unnecessary aggravation of costs through its
conduct in the proceedings (e.g. deficiencies in its presentation of the case or obstructive

behavior)”.'°7

Against this background, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has caused such an
“unnecessary aggravation of costs”.!°** The Claimant, for example, (1) submitted “massively
overbroad document production requests”;'°*° (2) disclosed funding sources of its investment in

an untimely manner, creating a comparable situation to Plama, in which the Tribunal ordered the

claimant to bear arbitration costs and the respondent’s legal costs; '° and (3) “pursued a
convoluted and ever-changing approach to the quantification of alleged damages” and “even
submitted a highly unusual supplemental expert report” which presented new arguments and

required the Respondent to expend considerable resources in order to respond to it.''

Further, the Respondent submits that its costs are reasonable in amount, noting that its costs “are
as much as four times lower than the reported average costs of respondents in investment treaty
disputes.”!07

The Respondent also states that the reasonableness of its costs is supported by the following four

by

 

factors.'°® First, the Respondent employed a number of methods to increase cost efficiencies

“coordinating its submissions”, engaging “the same counsel team”, “coordinating submission
calendars and logistics with opposing counsel” among the six cases originally brought by a single
Notice of Arbitration, and “agreeing to the same tribunal and joint hearing” in PCA Cases 2014-
19, 2014-20, 2014-21 and 2014-22.'% Second, the case at hand has presented “a number of

complex factual and legal issues”.!°*

Third, the present case is “of significant importance” to the
Czech Republic, given that “it could face a wave of additional claims if the decision in this case
were favourable to Claimant.”'® Fourth, the present proceedings have become lengthy because
of a number of factors outside the Respondent’s control, such as the EC’s attempt to intervene
and the Czech Republic’s replacement of counsel due to the public procurement rules.” Lastly,
the Respondent claims that even “if [the Claimant] were to prevail on some or all of its claims”,
the Claimant should be required to bear its costs.'*

In respect of costs incurred in the context of the briefing on the Achmea judgment, the Respondent
argues that such briefing was “both necessary and entirely reasonable for the Czech Republic to

request” given that it was a “landmark development” and that “the pursuit of EU law-based

As regards costs incurred in connection with the challenge to Mr. Beechey, the Respondent

argues that it “was based on very real concerns”, “was not frivolous, vexatious, or dilatory” and

“was pursued promptly and efficiently”.'°"°

Finally, the Respondent objects to the Claimant claiming reimbursement for “IPVIC’s internal
costs”, as there “is no reason for the Czech Republic to bear any share of the unspecified ‘internal’

costs incurred by a non-party to the proceedings.”""!

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The Tribunal will first detail the arbitration costs and the costs for legal representation and

assistance of the Parties. It will then determine the apportionment of such costs.

1. Costs

Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules states that the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its
award, providing a list of items that may be claimed as such costs. These items include the fees
and expenses of the Tribunal, the approved costs of witnesses and the reasonable costs for legal

representation and assistance.

The Tribunal estimates that it has spent roughly equal amounts of time and effort on PCA Case
Nos. 2014-19, 2014-20, 2014-21 and 2014-22. It therefore considers it reasonable to divide its
costs and expenses, as well as the costs and expenses of the PCA, equally among the four

arbitrations as follows.

The fees of Mr. Gary Born, co-arbitrator until his resignation on 24 June 2018, amount to

EUR 31,912.50 and his expenses amount to EUR 749.72.

The fees of Mr. John Beechey CBE, co-arbitrator, amount to EUR 5,250. Mr. Beechey did not

have any expenses.

The fees of Mr. Toby Landau QC, co-arbitrator, amount to EUR 39,135.42 and his expenses
amount to EUR 653.49.

The fees of Professor Hans van Houtte, presiding arbitrator, amount to EUR 64,442.50 and his

expenses amount to EUR 121.50.

The costs of other tribunal expenses, including the costs of a court reporter, interpretation,

technician, catering, printing and courier charges, and others total EUR 20,142.84.
PCA fees amount to EUR 36,500. The PCA incurred no expenses.

Each Party paid advances on costs in the amount of EUR 100,000, i.e., a total advance of

EUR 200.000.

As for the Parties’ respective costs of legal representation and assistance, the Claimant’s costs
related to this arbitration amount to EUR 402,986.09. The Respondent’s costs related to this
arbitration amount to USD 1,246,817. Considering the complexity of this proceeding, the novel
issues of fact and law that have arisen in its context, and the fact that the costs relate to four

coordinated proceedings, both amounts appear reasonable.

2. Allocation of Costs

As correctly noted by both Parties, Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows with
regard to the allocation of costs:
1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each

of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such
costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable.

(a) The Costs of the Arbitration
As both Parties have recognised, Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules affords the Tribunal broad
discretion in matters of costs. Pursuant to Article 40(1), the unsuccessful party shall “in principle”
bear the costs of arbitration. Where no party clearly prevails, a common method to allocate costs
is to take account of the relative success of the claims and defenses. Another criterion that

tribunals frequently consider is the general conduct of a party throughout the proceedings.

As a first consideration, as far as the Parties’ success on their respective cases is concerned, the

Claimant has prevailed on jurisdiction, whereas the Respondent has prevailed on the merits.

As a second consideration, as far as the Parties’ conduct is concerned, the Tribunal considers that

Award

Page 202 of 204

counsel on both sides conducted this arbitration fairly and with high professional standards. None
of the facts that would clearly justify an adverse cost allocation, such as bad faith, abusive or

unreasonable argument, obstructive or dilatory tactics etc., was present in this arbitration.

Accordingly, in line with the presumption contained in Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules
and in the exercise of its discretion in matters of costs, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent

shall bear 25% and the Claimant shall bear 75% of the costs of arbitration.

The PCA shall therefore reimburse to the Respondent the unexpended balance of the deposit in
the amount of EUR 1,092.03. The Claimant is requested to reimburse to the Respondent the
amount of EUR 49,180.98 within six weeks of this Award.

(b) The Costs of Legal Representation and Assistance
Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules does not contain a presumption in favour of awarding the
costs of legal representation and assistance of the successful party. Instead, it provides that in

apportioning the costs, the Tribunal shall take account of “the circumstances of the case”.

The present arbitration was genuinely complex and raised difficult and novel issues of fact and
law, the outcome of which was uncertain. In particular, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant’s

claims, although ultimately unsuccessful, were reasonable.

In the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal therefore finds that in the circumstances of the
present case, it is fair for each Party to bear its own legal fees, costs, and expenses in this

arbitration, including fees, costs, and expenses related to expert and fact witnesses.

VIII. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
730. Based on the considerations set out above, the Tribunal rules as follows:

the sum of EUR 49,180.98.

(c) Each Party shall bear its own costs of legal representation and assistance.
