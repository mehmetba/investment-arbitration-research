PETITION AND MOTION TO VACATE ARBITRATION AWARD

Mesa Power Group, LLC (“Mesa Power”) petitions and moves this Court for an order
vacating an Award by two members of a three-member tribunal award in favor of Respondent, the
Government of Canada (“Canada”), in an arbitration rendered pursuant to Chapter Eleven of the
North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) involving the unfairness and abuse of the
renewable energy regulatory process by the Government of Ontario. The arbitral tribunal issued
corrections to the award aimed at certain errors in the Award. The Permanent Court of Arbitration,
who administered this arbitration, served an authentic originally-signed Rectified Majority Award
upon the disputing parties on June 6, 2016.

PARTIES

1. Petitioner Mesa Power is a Delaware limited liability corporation with its principal
place of business in Texas. Its members are Mr. T. Boone Pickens, a U.S. citizen and resident of
Texas, and Mesa Renewables MM, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that is in turn

owned by Mr. T. Boone Pickens.

2. Mesa Power owns Mesa Wind, LLC, which in turn owns and controls Mesa AWA,
LLC (“Mesa AWA”). Mesa Power wholly owns and controls (through Mesa AWA) the following
four wind farm investments in southwestern Ontario:

o TTD Wind Project ULC is an unlimited liability corporation incorporated in the
Province of Alberta.

o Arran Project ULC is an unlimited liability corporation incorporated in the
Province of Alberta.

o North Bruce Project, ULC is an unlimited liability corporation incorporated in
the province of Alberta.

o Summerhill Project, ULC is an unlimited liability corporation incorporated in
the Province of Alberta.

3. Respondent Canada is the government of Canada.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction based upon diversity of citizenship

pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1332. Petitioner Mesa Power has the citizenship of Texas given the
ultimate ownership of Mr. T. Boone Pickens noted above. Respondent Canada is of Canadian
nationality. Accordingly, complete diversity exits.

5. This Court also has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C § 1330 (a)
(“The district courts shall have original jurisdiction without regard to amount in controversy of any
nonjury civil action against a foreign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title as to any claim
for relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either
under sections 1605-1607 of this title or under any applicable international agreement”).

6. Service is being effectuated pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1608. Accordingly, personal
jurisdiction exists due to the effectuation of service on Canada pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1608. 28
U.S.C § 1330 (a) (“Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim for relief

over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsection (a) where service has been made

Case 1:16-cv-01101-JDB Document1 Filed 06/13/16 Page 3 of 5

under section 1608 of this title”).

7. This petition is brought pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C.
§ 10(a), which provides that “the United States court in and for the district wherein the award was
made may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration.”
9 U.S.C. §10(a). A “motion to confirm, vacate, or modify an arbitration award” under the Federal
Arbitration Act (“FAA”) may be made “either where the award was made or in any district proper
under the general venue statute.” Cortez Byrd Chips, Inc. v. Bill Harbert Constr. Co., 529 U.S. 193,
204 (2000). Accordingly, venue is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f), which provides that
civil actions against a foreign state can be brought “in the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia if the action is brought against a foreign state or political subdivision
thereof.” 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4).

GROUNDS FOR VACATING THE AWARD AND REMANDING IT

8. This petition is brought as a predicate for a formal motion to vacate to be made and
heard by the Court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 6. See 9 U.S.C. § 6 (“Any application to the court
hereunder shall be made and heard in the manner provided by law for the making and hearing of
motions, except as otherwise herein expressly provided”).

9. Chapter 1 of Title 9 of the U.S. Code provides the statutory grounds for vacatur of
an arbitral award. Specifically, pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §10, an award may be vacated for: (1)
corruption, fraud, or undue means; (2) evident partiality or arbitrator corruption; (3) arbitrator
misbehavior that prejudiced a party's rights; or (4) excess of authority. 9 U.S.C. §10.

10. | The Majority’s Award here should be vacated pursuant to subsections (3) and (4) of
9 U.S.C. §10:

- Misbehavior --- “the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the
hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and

Case 1:16-cv-01101-JDB Document1 Filed 06/13/16 Page 4 of 5

material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any
party have been prejudiced” (9 U.S.C. §10(3)); and

Excess of Powers -- “the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed
them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not
made” (9 U.S.C. §10(4)).
11. In addition, the Award should be vacated because it was rendered in manifest
disregard of the law.

12. Mesa Power’s petition for an order vacating the Award in its entirety and seeking
remand to a new arbitration tribunal is based on the accompanying motion, the memorandum
points and authorities filed, the supporting evidenced filed herewith, the papers and pleadings to be
filed in this proceeding and upon such other and further evidence or argument as may be presented
hereafter and/or at any hearing upon this motion.

13. Pursuant to LCvR 7(f), Petitioner Mesa Power requests oral argument.
