Reference: PCA Case No. 2012-17 - Mesa Power Group LLC v. Government of Canada

Dear Counsel,

The Tribunal acknowledges the Parties’ correspondence on the admission into
the record of the award in Bilcon v. Canada.

The Tribunal notes the Claimant's submission that the Tribunal has not closed
the proceedings and is empowered to take into account new legal authorities. It
also notes the Respondent's submission that “due process requires that the
Tribunal allow Canada sufficient time to file appropriate written submissions.” The
Tribunal believes that it would benefit from the Parties’ comments on the
relevance and impact of the Bilcon award and dissenting opinion for purposes of
the present arbitration. In the circumstances, it invites the Parties to make any
submissions they wish on this matter by 14 May 2015.

The Tribunal also notes the Respondent’s submission that “under Article 1128,
the United States and Mexico must also be afforded the opportunity to offer any
comments they have on the interpretation of NAFTA contained in the Bilcon
award.” The Parties are invited to comment on this submission within the same
time limit.

Best regards,

iy

Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler
On behalf of the Arbitral Tribunal
