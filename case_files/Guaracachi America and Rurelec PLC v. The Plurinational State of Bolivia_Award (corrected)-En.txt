(hereinafter, “GAT’), and Rurelec Plc, a company constituted under the laws in force in the
United Kingdom, with its principal place of business at Prince Consort House, 5"" Floor, 27-
29 Albert Embankment, London SE1 7TJ, United Kingdom (hereinafter, “Rurelec”, and

Belinda McRae, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP

2. The Respondent in the present arbitration is the Plurinational State of Bolivia (hereinafter,

“Bolivia” or the “Respondent”). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by:

Hugo Rail Montero Lara, Attorney General

Elizabeth Arismendi Chumacero, Deputy Defense Attorney and Legal Counsel to
the State

Ana Carolina Silva, Dechert (Paris) LLP

B. BACKGROUND TO THE ARBITRATION

3. The Claimants commenced these proceedings by a Notice of Arbitration dated 24 November
2010 pursuant to Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law

Arbitration Rules, as revised in 2010 (hereinafter, the “UNCITRAL Rules”), Article IX of

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 11 of 208

the Treaty between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of
the Republic of Bolivia Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of
Investment (hereinafter, the “US-Bolivia BIT”), and Article VIII of the Agreement between
the Government of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland and the Government of the
Republic of Bolivia for the Promotion and Protection of Investments (hereinafter, the “UK-

Bolivia BIT”, and together with the US-Bolivia BIT, the “Treaties” or “BITs”).

4. The Claimants alleged that the nationalisation carried out by the Bolivian State of GAI’s and
Rurelec’s 50.001% shareholding in Empresa Eléctrica Guaracachi S.A. (hereinafter,
“EGSA”), a company incorporated under the laws of Bolivia, as well as the failure to obtain
justice through the Bolivian court system, caused injury to the Claimants quantified at
USD 142.3 million. Moreover, they argued that Bolivia seized further assets owned by
Rurelec’s subsidiary, Energia para Sistemas Aislados Energais S.A. (hereinafter,
“Energais”), resulting in a further loss of USD 661,535. Therefore, they commenced these

proceedings so as to obtain adequate and effective compensation from the Tribunal.'

CHAPTER II - PROCEDURAL HISTORY

By letter dated 24 November 2010, pursuant to Article IX of the US-Bolivia BIT and Article
VII of the UK-Bolivia BIT, the Claimants served the Respondent with a Notice of

Arbitration, which was received by the latter on 30 November 2010.

By letter dated 12 January 2011, the Claimants appointed Mr Manuel Conthe as the first

arbitrator.

On 28 March 2011, given that the deadline of 30 days from the appointment of the first
arbitrator had elapsed without the Respondent appointing an arbitrator, the Claimants
requested that the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (hereinafter, the

“PCA”) designate an appointing authority to appoint the second arbitrator.

On 27 April 2011, the Secretary-General of the PCA designated H.E. Judge Gilbert
Guillaume as appointing authority in this arbitration for all purposes under the UNCITRAL
Rules.

On 3 May 2011, the Respondent sent a letter appointing Dr Ratil Emilio Vinuesa as the

second arbitrator. Such appointment was accepted by the Claimants on 10 May 2011.

. On 20 June 2011, in light of the Parties’ inability to agree on the appointment of the

presiding arbitrator, the appointing authority was requested to proceed with such
appointment. As requested, by letter dated 8 August 2011, H.E. Judge Gilbert Guillaume

appointed Dr José Miguel Jtidice as the presiding arbitrator.

. On 9 December 2011, taking into account the agreements reached between the Parties, the

Parties communicated a copy of the Terms of Appointment and Procedural Order No. 1
(hereinafter, the “Procedural Order No. 1”) to the PCA, which provided, inter alia, that the
languages of the arbitration would be English and Spanish, that the PCA would act as
registry and administering authority for the proceedings, and that the place and legal seat of
the proceedings would be The Hague. In addition, Procedural Order No. 1 set forth the

following procedural calendar:
“12. Pleadings: Number, Sequence, Time Limits
12.1. The Claimants shall file its Statement of Claim on I March 2012.

12.2. The Respondent shall file its Statement of Defense, pursuant to the UNCITRAL Rules,
on 1 August 2012.

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 13 of 208

12.3. The Claimants shall file its Reply, in accordance with Article 24 of the UNCITRAL
Rules, on I November 2012.

12.4. The Respondent shall file its Rejoinder, in accordance with Article 24 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, on 1 February 2013.

12.7. An oral hearing will be held from 1 to 10 April 2013 (exclusive of the weekend) at

which the Parties will present their experts and witnesses, and make oral submissions.”

. On 1 March 2012, the Claimants submitted, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, their

Statement of Claim in English, accompanied by witness statements, the expert report of Dr

Manuel Abdala, and all other evidence relied upon in support of their Statement of Claim.

. On 23 March 2012, the Claimants submitted, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, a

Spanish translation of the documents mentioned in the previous paragraph.

. By letter dated 26 June 2012, the Respondent informed both the Tribunal and the Claimants

that, on 13 June 2012, the Office of the Attorney General had determined that the public
tender to retain the services of external counsel had been unsuccessful, since none of the
tendering firms had met the required conditions. As a consequence, the Respondent

requested a two (2) month extension for the submission of its Statement of Defence.

. On 2 July 2012, after considering the Claimants’ arguments against granting such an

extension, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2. The Tribunal decided to grant a 45-
day extension. In addition, it urged the Parties to try to agree within a deadline of 30 days on

a calendar for further submissions that would not require postponing the scheduled hearing.

. On 9 August 2012, following the Parties’ failure to reach an agreement and the expiry of the

aforementioned deadline, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, wherein it was

decided that the procedural calendar would be as follows:

“(a) The Respondent shall file its Statement of Defense, pursuant to the UNCITRAL
Rules, on 14 September 2012;

(b) The Claimants shall file their Reply, in accordance with Article 24 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, on 5 December 2012;

(c) The Respondent shall file its Rejoinder, in accordance with Article 24 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, on 22 February 2013; and

(d) An oral hearing will be held on 1-10 April 2013 (exclusive of the weekend) at
which the Parties will be able to examine experts and witnesses, and make oral

submissions.”

By letter dated 9 August 2012, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had retained
Dechert (Paris) LLP as external counsel. Moreover, it requested that the Tribunal bifurcate
the proceedings (hereinafter, the “Request for Bifurcation’) pursuant to Article 23(3) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, on the following grounds: (i) the merely contractual nature of the
Claimants’ claims; (ii) the Claimants, by resorting to the Bolivian courts, have exercised a
choice under the fork-in-the-road clause provided for in the US-Bolivia BIT, such that the
arbitration should proceed only in respect of the nationalisation claim; and (iii) the premature

nature of the claims raised by the Claimants.

. On 13 August 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 wherein the Claimants were

granted until 23 August 2012 to submit any comments they might have on the Request for

Bifurcation. The procedural calendar set forth in Procedural Order No. 3 was maintained.

. By e-mail of 23 August 2012, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal grant an extension

of the deadline set forth in Procedural Order No. 4, until 27 August 2012, in order to “have
an opportunity to consult with the Claimants’ representatives with respect to the

Respondent’s request.”

By e-mail of 23 August 2012, the presiding arbitrator granted the extension requested by the

Claimants.

On 24 August 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, wherein it confirmed the
extension granted by the presiding arbitrator by e-mail, while maintaining the procedural

calendar set forth in Procedural Order No. 3.

By letter dated 27 August 2012, the Claimants submitted their Response to Respondent’s
Request for Bifurcation and submitted new evidence in support thereof. The Claimants
requested that the Tribunal reject such Request on the following grounds: (i) the Request for
Bifurcation was a dilatory tactic contrary to the procedural agreement reached by the Parties

set forth in Procedural Order No. 1, (ii) bifurcation would not achieve any greater efficiency

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 15 of 208

or economy, and (iii) bifurcation was also inappropriate as the jurisdictional objections could

not be separated from the merits of the dispute.

23. By letter dated 29 August 2012, the Respondent acknowledged receipt of the Claimants’
Response to the Request for Bifurcation and made a series of clarifications and corrections to
the Tribunal on the matter, asserting that the Claimants had raised new claims (hereinafter,

the “New Claims”).

24. On 30 August 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, disregarding the last letter
sent by Respondent given its untimely nature. In such Order, the Tribunal acknowledged the
difficulty of deciding on the Request for Bifurcation due to the lack of complete information

on the position of the Parties and concluded as follows:

“(a) The calendar of submissions, defined through common agreement by
Procedural Order No. 1 as amended by Procedural Orders Nos. 2 and 3, is
maintained and therefore Respondent shall file its Statement of Defense on 14
September 2012, and the other Submissions will follow as and in accordance

with the defined calendar;

(b) On 14 September 2012, either as part of its Statement of Defense or in a
separate Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Respondent shall set forth in full its

objections to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal;

(c) On 15 October 2012, the Claimants shall file a Counter-Memorial on

Jurisdiction;
(d) On 31 October 2012, the Respondent may file a Reply on Jurisdiction;

(e) If a Reply has been filed, the Claimants may file a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on
15 November 2012;

7

Once the Parties have fully pleaded the jurisdictional issues, as set forth in the
above calendar, the Tribunal will decide whether (i) to bifurcate the
proceedings and hold specific hearings on the jurisdictional issues, (ii) to refuse
the requested bifurcation and therefore to decide on its own jurisdiction
following the scheduled hearings on the merits, or (iii) to decide on its

jurisdiction without the need for any hearing;

? According to the Respondent, “New Claims” are alleged violations of the BITs on the part of Bolivia in connection with:
(i) electricity spot prices; (ii) power or capacity payments; and (iii) the two Worthington engines. According to the
Respondent, these claims were not raised in the Notice of Dispute dated 13 May 2010 or in the Notice of Arbitration dated 24
November 2010.

(g) To allow the possibility referred under f) (iii) above, and in accordance with
Article 17(3) of the UNCITRAL Rule 2010, Parties are requested to state on
their Memorial and Counter-Memorial whether they would request an oral

hearing on jurisdiction, even if the Arbitral Tribunal considers it unnecessary.”

By e-mail of 30 August 2012, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal reconsider the
decision adopted in Procedural Order No. 6 “taking into account the arguments submitted in
good faith” in its letter dated 29 August 2012. Furthermore, the Respondent requested a
further 45-day extension, until 29 October 2012, to file its Statement of Defence “taking into
account (i) the inclusion of New Claims by the Claimants in the Statement of Claim, (ii) the
recent hiring of the legal team of Dechert and (iii) that the Respondent has only received the
electronic damages model of Dr Manuel Abdala, Claimants’ expert, last Wednesday, 29

August 2012” [Tribunal’s translation].

By letter dated 3 September 2012, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s request on
two grounds: (i) the Respondent had been in possession of the Statement of Claim since 1
March 2012, which was enough time to have submitted its Statement of Defence, and (ii) the
delay and the request for an additional extension to submit its Statement of Defence were
both unjustifiable and unfair. They requested that the Respondent adhere to the calendar
established in Procedural Order No. 6.

On 3 September 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7, whereby, in order to
ensure the conditions necessary for the Respondent to submit its Statement of Defence, the
Tribunal decided to modify the schedule of submissions on the merits, whilst not making any
change to the schedule of submissions on jurisdiction. Hence, the Tribunal set a new

calendar:

‘a) On 5 October 2012, the Respondent shall file a Response;
b) On 4 January 2013, the Claimants shall file Reply;
¢) On 13 February 2013, the Respondent shall file a Rejoinder;

d) On 14 March 2013, each Party shall provide, with a copy to the Tribunal and
the PCA: (a) the names of the witnesses whose statement or report has been
submitted by the other Party with the request that they be available for cross-
examination at the hearing; and (b) as the case may be, a request for the Tribunal to
permit the appearance at the hearing of witnesses whose statement or report has

been submitted by the Party.”

By subsequent e-mails between the Parties and the Tribunal dated 14 September 2012, it was

agreed that the Respondent would file its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 17 September 2012.

On 17 September 2012, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with
witness statements and relevant supporting evidence. Once again, the Respondent reiterated
its request that the Tribunal bifurcate the proceedings on the following grounds:
“(a) Claimants have commenced an arbitration that entails an undue joinder of Treaties and

nor holds an ‘investment’ in Bolivia in the terms of the United Kingdom Treaty; and
(c) Bolivia is entitled to deny the benefits of the United States Treaty to Guaracachi America

pursuant to Article XII thereof” [Tribunal’s Translation].

By letter dated 22 September 2012, the PCA informed the Respondent that the
abovementioned documents had been received and that the Tribunal had decided to continue

the proceedings pursuant to the timetables set forth in Procedural Orders Nos. 6 and 7.

By e-mail of 23 September 2012, the Respondent informed the PCA that “it has made a

formal request that a true bifurcation be ordered and that the scheduled deadlines regarding

the merits of the case, including that of October 5, 2012 for the submission of the

Respondent’s Statement of Defense, be set aside”.

By letter dated 24 September 2012, the PCA informed the Respondent that the Tribunal,
“considering that there are no new facts that would justify amending the calendars set forth

in its prior orders”, maintained the deadlines established in Procedural Orders Nos. 6 and 7.

By letter dated 4 October 2012, the Respondent requested an extension of 10 days, until
Monday, 15 October, to the deadline to file its Response on the merits on the following
grounds: (i) the New Claims raised by the Claimants were sufficiently complex from a
technical standpoint that their expert had been unable to complete his work; (ii) the expert
appointed by the Respondent had only had one month and one week to prepare an answer to
such report, whereas the Claimants’ expert had had at least 15 months between the
submission of the Notice of Arbitration and the Statement of Claim to prepare his report; and
(iii) were such extension to be granted, it would not affect the procedural calendar set forth
in Procedural Order No. 6. Additionally, the Respondent proposed a new procedural calendar
whereby, if the extension requested were granted, it would give up 10 days for the purpose
of preparing its Rejoinder, thus ensuring that the Claimants’ right to file their Reply was not

curtailed.

By subsequent e-mails of the same date, the Tribunal decided to grant the extension
requested by the Respondent. Furthermore, it took note of the consequences suggested by the

Respondent with respect to the reduction of the period for filing its Rejoinder.

By subsequent e-mail, the Claimants regretted not having had the opportunity to comment on
the extension requested by the Respondent before the Tribunal decided thereon. On the other
hand, they requested that the Tribunal grant a 10-day extension as from the date of receipt of
the Statement of Defence, until 26 October 2012, to submit their Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction, as otherwise they would have only 10 days as from the reception of the

Statement of Defence to file their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.

In response to this request, by e-mail of 4 October 2012, Respondent informed the Tribunal
that such an extension would affect the subsequent dates set forth in the procedural calendar,
as Bolivia was to file its Reply on Jurisdiction on 31 October 2012, i.e., five days following
receipt of Claimants’ Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. Accordingly, it argued that it should
be able to file its Reply on Jurisdiction no earlier than 9 November 2012. However, in view
of other commitments that posed a conflict with such date, it requested that, were the
Claimants’ extension to be granted, it be allowed to submit its Reply on Jurisdiction by 23

November 2012.

By e-mail of 5 October 2012, the Claimants consented to Bolivia’s proposal, provided that

they were allowed to file their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction by 17 December 2012.

On 9 October 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8. The Tribunal accepted, “as
a strict and final exception”, the Respondent’s request that the deadline for the filing of its
Statement of Defence be extended until 15 October 2012, together with the consequences
suggested by the Respondent with respect to the reduction of the period for the filing its
Rejoinder. Finally, the Tribunal accepted the agreement reached by the Parties with respect
to the extensions for the filing of their submissions on jurisdiction. Therefore, a new

schedule was established, for submissions on the merits as well as on jurisdiction as follows:

“a) On 15 October 2012, the Respondent shall file their Statement of Defence;

b) On 26 October 2012, the Claimants shall file their Counter-Memorial on

Jurisdiction;

c) On 23 November 2012, the Respondent may file a Reply on Jurisdiction;

e) Once the Parties have fully pleaded the jurisdictional issues, as set forth in the above
calendar, the Tribunal will decide whether (i) to bifurcate the proceedings and hold
specific hearings on the jurisdictional issues, (ii) to refuse the requested bifurcation and
therefore to decide on its own jurisdiction following the scheduled hearings on the

merits, or (iii) to decide on its jurisdiction without the need for any hearing;

f) On 13 January 2013, the Claimants shall file Reply on the merits;

g) On 13 February 2013, the Respondent shall file a Rejoinder on the merits; and

h) On 14 March 2013, each Party shall provide, with a copy to the Tribunal and the
PCA: (a) the names of the witnesses whose statement or report has been submitted by
the other Party with the request that they be available for cross-examination at the
hearing; and (b) as the case may be, a request for the Tribunal to permit the
appearance at the hearing of witnesses whose statement or report has been submitted

by the Party.”

On 15 October 2012, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defence and supporting

documents, as stated in Procedural Order No. 8.

By letter dated 19 October 2012, the Claimants acknowledged receipt of the above
documents and requested the valuation model prepared by the Respondent’s expert in

electronic format.

On 22 October 2012, the Respondent made the valuation report available to the Claimants in

electronic format as requested.

On 26 October 2012, the Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction in

accordance with the schedule set forth in Procedural Order No. 8.

On 23 November 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9. The Tribunal accepted
the possibility of holding a hearing on jurisdiction within the period between 21 January and
8 February 2013 and lasting a maximum of three days. However, it would not alter the dates
scheduled for the hearing on the merits, if any was held. At the same time, it invited the

Parties to make any comments on this proposal by 27 November 2012.

the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 9. They informed the Tribunal that due to other
professional commitments, they would be unavailable on the dates proposed for the holding
of a hearing on jurisdiction, and restated their position that a single hearing should be held on

both jurisdictional objections and the merits of the case.

By letter of the same date, the Respondent also submitted its comments regarding a possible
hearing on jurisdiction. In this regard, the Respondent (i) expressed its disagreement with the
failure to suspend the proceedings on the merits; (ii) proposed that the hearing on jurisdiction
be held on the dates scheduled for the hearing on the merits; and, finally, (iii) informed the
Tribunal that its representatives would be available for a hearing on jurisdiction on 4-5

February 2013, and suggested that the hearing be held in Paris.

On 30 November 2012, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction, together with all

relevant supporting documents.

By letter dated 12 December 2012, the Claimants stated that due to certain alleged actions by
Bolivia Mercados Energéticos Consultores (hereinafter, “MEC”) had ceased providing

CHAPTER III - FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. INTRODUCTION

95. GAI, a company incorporated in the United States of America, and Rurelec, a company
constituted under the laws of the United Kingdom, acting in their capacity as Claimants in
these arbitration proceedings, submit claims for economic compensation against the
Plurinational State of Bolivia, by virtue of their status as investors from the United States
and the United Kingdom in accordance with the Treaties between these two States and

Bolivia.

96. The Claimants have brought these arbitration proceedings in order to obtain compensation
from Bolivia for the damages allegedly caused by modifications made to the regulatory
framework governing the electricity sector, the failure of the Bolivian judiciary to provide

justice and, ultimately, the nationalisation of both investors’ 50.001% stake in EGSA.

B. FACTUAL CONTEXT PRIOR TO THE PRIVATIZATION OF EGSA

97.

a

According to the Claimants, during the 1980s, Bolivia faced an economic crisis marked by a
drop in investments, savings, exports, consumption, and a decreasing GDP, as well as by
periods of hyperinflation, a large foreign debt, etc. This situation also threatened to produce
an imbalance in the balance of payments, which would render impossible any attempt at the

future growth of the county.*

98.

oO

Therefore, the Claimants state that, in 1985, the Bolivian Government, with the support of
several multilateral organisations and agencies, decided to implement a structural reform
program consisting in the elimination of local price controls, the reduction of tariffs, the
encouragement of currency floating, the promotion of the private sector, the privatization of

State-owned companies, and the reduction of the degree of economic regulation.‘

99.

6S

Starting in 1991, the effects of the reforms could be clearly observed. As of that year,
according to Claimants, the Bolivian economy experienced considerable growth. This
development also coincided with funding from international institutions to boost the Bolivian
economy, in turn benefiting the electricity sector, to which part of such funding was

allocated.

’s

 

100. Nonetheless, from the Claimants’ viewpoint, the funds allocated were not enough. Bolivi:
electricity sector accounted for 50% of the country’s exports, and took up 40% of public
investment. This meant that, without a continuous injection of funds from international

institutions, the sector remained at constant risk.°

101. While the Respondent asserts that the Bolivian electricity sector at the time was sustainable,®
the Claimants allege that the electricity sector faced various problems, such as a worldwide
lack of funding (which entailed the reduction of multilateral funding for the electricity
sector), the freezing of new investments (due to the suspension during the economic crisis of
the application of the 9% rate of return on investment established in the National Electricity
Code), and the limited technical abilities of the National Electricity Management Agency,

the entity responsible for the regulation of electricity services.’

102. The Claimants contend that these difficulties forced the Bolivian electricity sector and the
National Electricity Company (Empresa Nacional de Electricidad, hereinafter, “ENDE”),
the State electricity producer, into a difficult financial position and made it necessary to
restructure the sector with the benefit of financial aid and technical capacity from foreign

investors.*

103. However, the Respondent asserts that ENDE was the largest electricity generator in the
country and also had highly qualified personnel’ and modern electrical units. Moreover,
ENDE had reported positive financial results through 1995 (the year of the capitalization)
and had a generation capacity of 498 Mw."°

104. The Claimants deny that ENDE enjoyed such a good position and argue that its financial
results do not truly reflect the reality of the situation. Thus, between 1986 and 1993, the
Government had to absorb part of ENDE’s debt, covering its liabilities by using USD 102

million of YPFB and treasury funds. Furthermore, contrary to Bolivia’s assertions," the joint

condition of the electricity sector was confirmed by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (hereinafter,

° In this regard, the Claimants affirm in their Reply on the Merits, {21, that Bolivia has only challenged the qualification of
the personnel hired by ENDE. Thus, the Respondent has accepted the fact that the General Electricity Directorate was limited

report of the United Nations Development Program (hereinafter, “UNDP”) and the World
Bank described ENDE’s financial position as “strained”.'? Therefore, a considerable
injection of funds was necessary to ensure the preservation of the electricity sector in

Bolivia.

105. The Respondent for its part denies the foregoing assertions and reaffirms that ENDE yielded
positive financial results as set forth in its annual reports. In addition, the Respondent asserts
that the Bolivian electricity sector was able to finance itself, except during the period used by
the Claimants (1983-1985). In fact, the UNDP and World Bank deemed ENDE to be one of

the most efficient electricity generation and transmission companies."

C. THE NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR THE BOLIVIAN ELECTRICITY
SECTOR

1. Legal Framework

106. At the beginning of the 1990s, Bolivia implemented broad reforms aimed at attracting
foreign investors and establishing a new regulatory framework that would foster the
involvement of the private sector and competition in the energy sector and, in particular, in

the electricity industry.'*

107.In this vein, in September 1990, Bolivia enacted Law No. 1182 (hereinafter, the
“Investment Law’) for the purposes of “stimulating” and “ensuring” national and foreign

investments in Bolivia, as reinforced by treaties.'°

108. Subsequently, in 1992, Bolivia passed Law No. 1330 (hereinafter, the “Privatization Law’),

chiefly targeted at the privatization of small State-owned enterprises.

109.In 1994, the Bolivian Government enacted a new law, Law No. 1544 (hereinafter, the
“Capitalization Law”), through which the private sector was allowed to participate in

international public tenders and bid for equity offerings, thus acquiring shares in the main

State-controlled entities,'° including ENTEL (telecommunications), YPFB (hydrocarbons),
ENDE (generation and transmission of electricity), ENAF (mineral-ore processing), LAB
(airlines), and ENFE (railways).'”

110. The statutory privatization scheme allowed private investors to acquire a 50% interest in the
abovementioned entities, as well as to obtain control over the management of the relevant
State-owned companies in exchange for a certain amount of capital. The remaining 50%
(which investors were not allowed to acquire) was allocated to a public fund, created to

guarantee Bolivian pensions. '*

. The cornerstone of the regulatory framework was Law No. 1604 of 1994, (hereinafter, the
“Electricity Law”), which established the basic framework for the supply of electricity. In
addition, an independent entity was created, the Electricity Superintendency
(Superintendencia de Electricidad, hereinafter, the “SSDE”), charged with the enforcement
of the Electricity Law and the management of the electricity sector,'” and the National Power
Dispatch Committee (Comité Nacional de Despacho de Carga, hereinafter, the “CNDC”),
which was subject to the oversight of the SSDE.””

112. Afterwards, in further development of the objectives of the Electricity Law, the Wholesale
Electricity Market Operation Regulations (Reglamento de Operacién del Mercado Eléctrico

Mayorista, hereinafter, “ROME 1995”) and the Prices and Tariffs Regulations (Reglamento
de Precios y Tarifas, hereinafter “RPT 1995”) were jointly issued in 1995.7! Finally, in
2001, Supreme Decrees No. 26093 and No. 26094 published a new ROME and RPT
(hereinafter, “ROME 2001” and “RPT 2001”),” which replaced the prior ones.

2. Guarantees Afforded by the Regulatory Framework

113. The new regulatory framework included a series of guarantees based on the principles of
efficiency, transparency, quality, continuity, adaptability and neutrality, enshrined in Section

3 of the Electricity Law.”

114. These guarantees were in line with the guidelines laid down by the UNDP and the World
Bank, which may be summed up as follows: “(a) ensure that the interconnected system
would be operated at the minimum level of cost following appropriate reliability and
environmental standards; (b) promote—through competition and private sector
participation—an efficient and reliable electricity supply and the efficient use of electricity;
(c) open the sector to private initiative and strengthen market competition, open access to
networks, improve efficiency, and attract fresh capital for its development; (d) set tariffs that

enable the utilities to compete on equal basis; and (f) ensure that these policy directives
would be followed through the creation of an effective, transparent and independent
regulatory framework that clearly states the rights and responsibilities of the different sector

players.”

D. CREATION OF EGSA FOLLOWING THE CAPITALIZATION OF ENDE

115. The Capitalization Law provided for the transfer of the assets of State-owned enterprises,
including ENDE, to new companies that would receive an inflow of private capital through

an international public tender process.

116. Additionally, the Electricity Law set forth that the National Interconnected System (Sistema
Interconectado de Electricidad; hereinafter, “SIN’”), which had been until then composed of
vertically-integrated companies, would now be split into generation companies, transmission
companies, and distribution companies. Thus, the assets of ENDE were separated and three

new generation companies were created: Corani, Valle Hermoso, and EGSA. Three power

plants belonging to ENDE were transferred to the latter company: Guaracachi in Santa Cruz,

Aranjuez in Sucre, and Karachipampa in Potosi.”

117.In 1994, the international public tender process, in which 50% of the capital of EGSA was

tendered, was commenced.

E. INVESTMENTS PURPORTEDLY MADE BY THE CLAIMANTS

118. On 29 June 1995, Energy Initiatives, Inc., a US subsidiary of General Public Utilities Power
Inc. (hereinafter, “GPU”), was declared the successful bidder in the abovementioned
international public tender, with a bid of USD 47.13 million in exchange for a 50%

shareholding in EGSA, which at that time held the three aforementioned gas plants.”

119. Pursuant to the Terms and Conditions of the tender, the successful bidder could be—or, in
the Claimants’ opinion, had to be—a company whose sole purpose was to hold the shares of
the company which was the subject of the tender.’ Accordingly, Energy Initiatives set up a

subsidiary, GAI, one of the Claimants in these proceedings.*

120. Later, on 28 July 1995, after EGSA was granted an electricity generation license for a period
of 30 years for each of the plants (renewed for 10 additional years) as well as license
agreements, Bolivia, GAI, and EGSA entered into a Capitalization Agreement. This
Agreement provided that payment had in fact been made and determined the allocation of
the new capital: 90% was to be allocated, within seven years, to capital investments that

would increase generation capacity.”

121.In 1998, in order to increase electricity generation capacity, EGSA’s shareholders and Board
of Directors® approved the purchase of two General Electric 6FA industrial gas turbines,

known as GCH-9 and GCH-10. These were installed in the Santa Cruz plant and started

operating in 1999. According to the Claimants, this constituted a new investment of USD 65

million and produced a capacity increase of 149.9 MW.*"

122. This meant that, by 1999, EGSA had an aggregate capacity of 397.6 MW and had made,
according to the Claimants, investments of USD 72.2 million in Bolivia (representing
154.3% of the USD 47.1 million in new capital which EGSA had received). Given that
these investment exceeded those required by the 90% investment obligation established in
the Capitalization Agreement, GAI was allowed to acquire in 1999 an additional 0.001% of
EGSA’s capital, thus gaining control over the company” and over the appointment five out

of seven members of the Board.

123.In 2001, GPU merged with First Energy Corp., another US company. Then, in 2003, First
Energy Corp. sold its interest in GAI to Bolivia Integrated Energy Limited (hereinafter,

124.On 8 October 2004, by means of a sale agreement between Rurelec and EGSA, Rurelec
acquired Energia para Sistemas Aislados ESA S.A. (hereinafter, “ESA”), a subsidiary of

EGSA which was subsequently converted by Rurelec into Energais.*

125. According to the Claimants, a few months later, in 2005, Rurelec, through its wholly owned
British Virgin Islands subsidiary Birdsong Overseas Limited (hereinafter “Birdsong”),

entered into an agreement with IEL for the acquisition of 100% of the shares of BIE for USD

 

35 million, thereby indirectly acquiring 100% of GAI.** According to the Claimants, this sale
closed on 6 January 2006, after which Rurelec had acquired indirect ownership, through

Birdsong and BIE, of 100% of GAIL.” Nonetheless, the Respondent argues, based on the

electricity generation capacity by 185MW, investing another USD110 million. In particular,
between 2006 and 2008, new technology was incorporated (seven Jenbacher natural gas

engines for the Aranjuez plant and a new GE 6FA gas turbine for the Guaracachi plant).”? In

addition, in 2009, EGSA completed the construction of its fourth electricity generation
plant—the second in the city of Santa Cruz—known as the Santa Cruz co-generation plant.
The new plant had two turbines, GCH-7 and 8, which had to be moved out of the Guaracachi
plant to make space for the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine project (hereinafter, “CCGT”).

These works involved an additional investment of USD 3.5 million.”

127. It bears noting that, following the installation of new Jenbacher engines in the Aranjuez
plant, EGSA removed and sold four Worthington engines (which were older and ran on
diesel, thereby consuming a larger amount of fuel). Rurelec purchased two of them through
the acquisition of EGSA’s subsidiary, Energais,”" for USD 550,000. Once decommissioned,
the engines were dismantled and stored in the EGSA’s facilities in Sucre. The other two

engines were sold to European Power Systems AG.”

128. The last technological project undertaken by EGSA was the CCGT. This project began in
2007 and was scheduled to start operations in May 2010. However, it was then postponed to
November, which deadline was not met either. The purpose of the project—apart from
obtaining better economic and financial resultt—was to enhance the sustainable
development of Bolivia through the development of state-of-the-art combined cycle
technology, in accordance with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. This project resulted in a series of financial benefits for EGSA, which, according to
the Claimants, would be shared with the State (through the Vice-Ministry of Environment

and Territorial Planning) in 2007, in accordance with the applicable rules.“*

129. Furthermore, EGSA participated in certain projects to provide electricity to certain portions
of the Bolivian population who were not receiving adequate supply (the so-called Rural

Electrification Projects“). Since 2006, EGSA also subsidized low-income residential

nationalisation, EGSA had made no improvement whatsoever to the distribution of electricity in the area; it was not their
responsibility pursuant to the Agreement for the supply of electricity to rural areas. See Transcript (English), Day 1, 2 April

consumers by approximately USD 2.7 million through the so-called “Dignity Tariff’, which
was renewed in 2010 through the Dignity Tariff Agreement.”

130. The Respondent alleges that, with the exception of the USD 47 million paid by GAT in 1995
for the capitalization of EGSA, the Claimants have made no capital contribution of their
own. Rather, all of the abovementioned investments in new electricity generation capacity
were funded either with the resources of EGSA itself or with banking debt incurred by it.
Additionally, the Respondent contends that several developments led to the depletion by
2007 of the operating capital of EGSA, leading EGSA to see its value progressively reduced

until the date of the nationalisation.”°

131. In addition, the Respondent maintains that the CCGT project was considerably delayed, over
budget, and totally unfinished at the time of the nationalisation.*” On the other side, the
Claimants argue that the amounts invested in this project were in line with the budget
approved by the shareholders and directors of EGSA (which was increased in 2008 and
approved again) and included a further increase in power with respect to what was initially

forecasted. Moreover, the project was 95.1% completed by the time of the nationalisation.*

proving their assertions which has not been challenged by the Claimants.”

* Rejoinder on the Merits, 51-92. As examples of EGSA’s disinvestment, Respondent refers, inter alia, to the following:
the sale of the GCH-3 and GCH-5 units (these were the most efficient units, and their sale was not aimed at installing more
efficient technology, since the money obtained was distributed as profits among shareholders, and the Jenbacher engines
were installed five years later), the attempt to remove the KAR-I unit (a decision which was reversed by the Board of EGSA
after the nationalisation), the sale of the plot in the Santa Cruz industrial complex (challenged by ENDE representatives at the
Board of EGSA) or the sale of the engines of the Aranjuez plant to ESA (according to the Respondent, for the purposes of
ff EGSA’s difficult economic situation, the Respondent refers, inter alia, to the
sues acknowledged by the Claimants themselves, the problems with payments to suppliers, the lack of generation

profits between 2005 and 2009, or the distribution of dividends higher than the profits since 2006. Finally,
Bolivia denies the fact that EGSA received good ratings by rating agencies (deeming this an attempt to confuse the Tribunal),
and also denies that the rates at which EGSA could obtain funds until 2009 reflected a healthy economic condition.

F. REGULATORY AMENDMENTS DURING THE 2007-2008 PERIOD

 

133. The Claimants assert that GAI invested in EGSA on the basis of the regulatory framework
developed since 1990 and the guarantees provided thereby. Later, Rurelec decided to invest
(as further detailed below) in EGSA on the basis of the existing regulatory framework and
the guarantees, as well as Bolivia’s purported commitment (in the 2006 Dignity Tariff

Agreement, renewed in 2010) to maintain the regulatory framework described above.”

134. Nonetheless, despite this purported commitment, Bolivia proceeded as of 2007 to modify the
regulatory framework in respect of the method of compensation and ultimately proceeded
with an unexpected total nationalisation of the sector.*'

135. The Respondent disagrees with the Claimants’ view. To start, it denies that there was any
creeping expropriation which would have started with the amendment to the regulatory
framework and finished with the nationalisation of EGSA.* A creeping expropriation is
characterized by “a set of measures that, in isolation, do not have the effect of expropriating
the investment, but do have that effect when taken together” [Tribunal’s Translation]. There
is no such thing in the present case: the Nationalisation Decree did not constitute the final

step of a creeping expropriation.”

136. According to the Respondent, the Dignity Tariff Agreement did not contain a stabilization
clause“ and the first owners of GAT had already envisaged the possibility of a
nationalisation, given that Power Inc., a company belonging to the GPU Group, took out a
policy against expropriations with the Overseas Private Investment Corporation on 27
December 1995.*° In addition, the nationalisation was included in the 2006-2010
Government Program (in line with the nationalisation policy developed by Evo Morales),
was openly discussed by the press, and was addressed in negotiations between EGSA and the

Ministry of Hydrocarbons and Energy in early 2009 (and not in 2008, nor lasting until April

obtain a majority interest in EGSA was discussed.”

137.Lastly, the Respondent maintains that Bolivia made no guarantee that it would not
nationalise the electricity sector” and, in any event, the Claimants have not submitted any

evidence of such.”*
1. Modification of the Capacity Price Calculation

138. The first modification of the regulatory framework which allegedly affected the Claimants’

investment is that related to the capacity price (hereinafter, “PBP”).”

139. Initially, the calculation method was established by both ROME 1995 and RPT 1995. The
starting point for the calculation of the capacity price was the FOB price of a new generation
unit, a turbine. Certain additional costs related to its installation, connection, and entry into

operation were added to the FOB price. These additional costs could not exceed 50% of the

equipment’s catalogue value. A “discount rate” (“tasa de actualizaci6n’’) established by the
Electricity Law was then used to convert this total investment cost for new equipment into a

monthly sum per kilowatt of installed capacity.”

140. Subsequently, ROME 2001 and RPT 2001 introduced a number of modifications regarding

the PBP calculation.’ Such modifications were developed in Operating Rule

57 Statement of Defense, {{[69-81; Rejoinder on the Merits, (115.

** The Claimants mention (at {104 of the Statement of Claim) the existence of an e-mail sent by Marie Beatriz Souviron,
Bolivian Ambassador in the United Kingdom, stating that she was unaware of the possibility of the expropriation of
Rurelec’s interest in EGSA. However, Respondent noted that a copy of such e-mail was not submitted by the Claimants and
that, if it had been submitted, it would still be insufficient evidence, since it would only prove an officer's unawareness of the
nationalisation plans. The Respondent explains how Mr Earl has now changed hi enior officers of the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the United Kingdom would have confirmed that the Ambas s unaware of the nationalisation.
this is not evidence of the purported confirmation and in any case, even if such existed, it would only
demonstrate that a Bolivian diplomat in the United Kingdom was not aware of the nationalisation. Similarly, Mr Aliaga states
that he received guarantees from members of the Board of ENDE at a barbecue, without giving any names or explaining how
such guarantees would amount to commitments by the State (Rejoinder on the Merits, (9{116-117).

* Set forth in Article 49 e) of the Electricity Law. In accordance with RPT 1995 and RPT 2001, it is defined as the unitary
cost of increasing the installed capacity. It is tantamount to the Capacity Marginal Cost.

No. 19/2001, issued by the CNDC (Resolution approved by the SSDE No. 121/2001).
Nevertheless, the most relevant aspect to bear in mind in these proceedings is the
introduction by means of this Operating Rule of a new “complementary equipment” category
to be considered in the calculation of the Total Cost of the Investment (neither of ROME
2001 nor in RPT 2001 having made any provision therefor). This new category entailed a
20% increase on the FOB price,” added prior to the application of the 50% factor mentioned
above. This implied that the investment cost could reach up to 180% of a certain turbine’ s

FOB price.

14

. Following subsequent modifications to Operating Rule No. 19/2001,” on 8 February 2007,
the CNDC issued Operating Rule No. 19/2007 (Resolution approved by the SSDE
No. 040) by which the 20% “complementary equipment” head was eliminated from the PBP

calculation.

142. According to the Claimants, this measure resulted in a 17% decrease in capacity prices and
had a considerable impact on EGSA’s cash flows. The Claimants also allege that the
Resolution failed to comply with procedural requirements set forth in the law.*’ However,
according to the Respondent, the creation of the “complementary equipment” head was due
to certain specific circumstances.® The Respondent thus proceeded with its elimination once
these specific circumstances had ceased to exist and in accordance with a study performed
by the consulting firm Bates White, since there was no longer any economic justification to
add a further 20% “complementary equipment” amount to the turbine’s FOB price prior to

adding the 50% for additional costs.

143.On 22 March 2007, EGSA commenced an administrative proceeding before the
Superintendency of Electricity against the abovementioned measure. On 10 May 2007, the
motion was denied in Resolution SSDE No. 54/2007. On 31 May 2007, EGSA filed an

appeal of this decision before the Sistema de Regulacién Sectorial (hereinafter, the

April 2008, EGSA filed an action before the Supreme Court of Bolivia. In parallel, EGSA
also commenced a proceeding regarding the alleged procedural defects of Resolution SSDE
No. 040, which had been implemented by Resolution CNDC 209/2007. Both proceedings are
still pending.”

2. Modification of the Spot Price Calculation

144. The second modification having allegedly affected the Claimants’ investment is that relating
to spot prices. Initially, ROME 1995 and RPT 1995 established the price to be paid to
generators for power dispatched in the spot market.’’ The CNDC determined the spot price
by calculating the total remuneration for each plant” using the integral of the power injected
into the Main Interconnection System over an hour’s time, multiplied by the Short Term
Marginal Cost of Power.” The Marginal Cost was in turn established by the Last Marginal

Generation Unit.”

145. Following the signature in 1999 of the licenses authorizing EGSA to carry out power
generation activities for a 30-year term, the CNDC adopted Operating Rule No. 3/1999
(Resolution approved by SSDE No. 266/1999), which established that all thermal units
required to cover power demand during peak hours could be deemed the Marginal
Generation Unit.” Afterwards, with the enactment of ROME 2001 and RPT 2001, the spot
price calculation method was adjusted, setting forth a new definition of Marginal Cost which

excluded Forced Generation Units, i.e. those which, for technical reasons, were required to

7 Article 63, ROME 1995; Article 2, RPT 1995. Pursuant to RPT 1995, the spot market is defined as “the market of short
term electricity purchase and sale transactions, not having been contemplated in the supply agreements.”

” According to the Claimants (at {190 of the Statement of Claim), such payments were uniform for all generating units,
whereas the Respondent asserts (at {228 of the Memorial on Jurisdiction) that such uniformity did not exist.

7 Article 63, ROME 1995. Pursuant to Article 1 of ROME 1995, the Marginal Cost is defined as “the cost [...] to supply one
additional kilowatt-hour (kWh) of power, at a certain level of power demand and considering the generation and transmission
park to be fixed [...]” [Tribunal’s Translation]

    

  

™ Statement of Claim, 445; Memorial on Jurisdiction, {218. Pursuant to Article | of ROME 1995, the Marginal Generation
Unit is meant to be “the last generation unit capable of meeting a demand increase, dispatched by the CNDC in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Regulation” [Tribunal’s Translation. See Transcript (English), Day 1, 2 April 2013, 42:2-

dispatch in a specific geographic area despite other lower-cost sources of power supply

within the SIN.”

146. Following an additional modification made in 2003 in Operating Rule No. 3/1999,” in June
2008, the Bolivian Government amended Operating Rule No. 3 again in Supreme Decree
No. 29599, which was subsequently adopted by Resolution approved by the SSDE No.
283/2008. This new amendment excluded liquid fuel units (such as diesel units) from

consideration as potential Marginal Generating Unit.”*

147. According to the Claimants, this change caused a reduction in the profit margin of the most
efficient companies (such as EGSA).” However, from the Respondent’s point of view, the
main objective of the change (adopted in consultation and with the agreement of electricity

sector companies themselves*”

) was to optimize the pricing system in accordance with the
principle of supply efficiency (Article 3 of the Electricity Law) and to further environmental

policy goals."

148. According to the Respondent, such a change was necessary (as stated by the regulators of the
electricity market) in order to put an end to the perverse effect produced by the least efficient
units, which distorted the spot price of electricity and produced a windfall profit for all
electricity producers to the detriment of consumers. The above change thus created an
incentive for generation companies to replace obsolete diesel generators and install new

units.”

7 article 1, ROME 2001. In this sense, the concept of “Forced Generation Unit” is introduced, such being understood as the
“unit resulting from the generation in a mandatory way due to minimum performance requirements in an area, displacing
lower cost generation in the system” [Tribunal’s Translation].

™ Memorial on Jurisdiction, [§]226-227.

 

 

"8 In this sense, there is disagreement between the Parties. The Claimants consider in their Statement of Claim, 191, that
until 2008 all thermal units were candidates for selection as the Marginal Generation Unit, a fact that is denied by the
Respondent in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, {228, and in its Rejoinder on the Merits, 271, due to the above mentioned
modifications. See Transcript (English), Day 1, 2 April 2013, 66:2-66:23.

EGSA cannot be understood to have approved it, see Second Witness Statement of Andrade, 37, and Minutes of Session No.
236 of the CNDC dated 30 June 2008 (Exhibit R-87). The Respondent considered that it accepted both in its Statement of
Defense, 329, as well as in its Rejoinder on the Merits, 4291, that Mr Andrade voted against such modification.
Nevertheless, that is not the relevant issue, but that the CNDC is a self-regulatory authority that adopts rules by simple
majority.

149. As stated by the Claimants, the inefficient units to which Bolivia refers“ were inherited by
EGSA and subsequently put on sale in 2004 through ESA, but EGSA was prevented from
concluding such sale at the last minute. In any case, the Claimants assert that, given the
creation in 2003 of the stabilization fund for electricity prices, consumers were not
prejudiced by the regulatory framework that was in place prior to the introduction of
Resolution No. 283." Moreover, it is also not true that the pre-existing regulatory framework

created incentives for the use of inefficient generation units, but quite the contrary.*°

150. Nevertheless, the Respondent insists that the Claimants are wrong. Even if the stabilization
fund was aimed at preventing excessive variations in electricity prices for consumers, the
purpose of the spot price modification was very different. It sought to prevent price
distortion by excluding certain units from the calculation of marginal costs because they
were excessively inefficient. In addition, many other countries have adopted similar

measures, which show that this measure is reasonable.*°
3. Nationalisation of EGSA by Bolivia

151. According to the Claimants’ version of events, on 1 May 2010, at about 6:00am, Bolivian
military personnel appeared suddenly and without warning and forced their way into
EGSA’s offices.” A banner was put up with the message “NACIONALIZADO”
(“NATIONALISED”) and another one with the acronym of ENDE. In addition, on that same
day, President Evo Morales issued Supreme Decree No. 0493 (hereinafter, the
“Nationalisation Decree”), ordering the nationalisation of the 100% of GAI’s shareholding

in EGSA and transferring these shares to ENDE.**

152. Nevertheless, the Respondent maintains that the nationalisation was foreseeable and “it was

performed in a peaceful and orderly manner” and military personnel was only used in order

§5 Statement of Defense, 1305.

* Reply on the Merits, 478-83; Second Witness Statement of Andrade, 433. Regarding the stabilization of tariffs, the
Claimants hold that such fund did not affect the spot price level received by electricity generators as Bolivia suggests, and
likewise, it is also erroneous that EGSA has indefinitely accumulated funds in the Stabilization Fund.

imminent. In any event, when Evo Morales was elected and the platform for the nationalisation of hydrocarbons sector was
concocted, there were no signals in 2005 that the electricity sector could be subjected to the strict state control. Not until the
end did the Claimants realize that EGSA was going to be expropriated. In this regard, see First Witness Statement of Earl,

to “guarantee the peaceful transfer of the company’s control and avoid thefts during the
transition of materials or information that would prevent EGSA from continuing operations”

[Tribunal’s Translation]. In short, it was a normal procedure.”

153. Following the facts described above, EGSA’s senior staff was called to a meeting, and

» with the

ENDE proceeded, in accordance with Article 3 of the Nationalisation Decree,”
appointment of a new financial manager and legal advisor, which office was entrusted to

Mr Jerges Mercado.

154. Pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 2(III) of the Nationalisation Decree, ENDE
was to pay for the expropriation of GAI. Such compensation was to be determined through a
valuation process (carried out by an entity selected by the Government) lasting a maximum
of 120 days, after which payment was to be made.’ Additionally, Articles 2(V) and 5
provided that liabilities incurred by EGSA (including financial, tax, environmental liabilities,

etc.) would be deducted from the amount of compensation to be established.””

155.Between July 2010 and March 2011, the Claimants assert that four meetings were held
between Rurelec and certain Government representatives—including the Minister of
Hydrocarbons and Energy, the Vice Minister of Electricity, the Attorney General, and
ENDE’s General Manager, amongst others—in order to try to reach an agreement and have
the Bolivian authorities make an offer of compensation for the expropriation. Nevertheless,
according to the Claimants, in only one of the meetings (held on 8 November 2010) the
Claimants were informed of EGSA’s purported negative value (an assertion which was not

repeated in subsequent meetings). In the end, no offer of compensation was made.”*

156. In response to the Claimants’ assertions, the Respondent insists that Bolivia followed the
procedure legally set forth for the fixing of fair compensation due to the Claimants. In this
vein, it retained an independent consulting firm in July 2010 to perform the statutory audit
(which was eventually prepared by PROFIN Consultores S.A. within the 120-day deadline)”

and held five (and not four) meetings for the determination of fair compensation.” The
problem was that EGSA had a negative value and Bolivia therefore had no obligation

whatsoever to provide compensation.”

157. The Claimants assert that EGSA’s profits amounted to USD 5.8 million in 2010, as stated in
the financial statements which were approved by the Board of Directors in March 2011
following a positive assessment by PriceWaterhouseCoopers.”’ Despite such approval, on 20
April 2011, Nelson Caballero, head of ENDE, requested a new audit of EGSA’s Financial
Statements for 2010. According to the Claimants, this new audit sought to reduce EGSA’s
profits and thereby indirectly reduce the amount of compensation that the Claimants would
receive for the expropriation. The second audit reflected a loss of USD 2.3 million.** The
Respondent does not deny that this second audit took place, but it insists that it was totally
unrelated to the nationalisation, and that it did not have the objective that the Claimants

allege it had.”

158. Following EGSA’s nationalisation, Energais requested the release of the Worthington
engines so that they could be shipped to its facilities located in Argentina. However,
according to the Claimants, such request was denied, since EGSA’s Board of Director and its
General Manager considered that those assets had also been nationalised pursuant to Decree
No. 0493 and thus belonged to the Bolivian State.”

159.Given the above, Energais and Rurelec’s lawyers sent various letters to the Government
requesting the return of the engines, since they considered that they could not have been
included within the Nationalisation Decree given that title thereto had been transferred to

Energais in 2004.'""

CHAPTER V - THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS ON JURISDICTION

A. ALLEGED JOINDER AND/OR CONSOLIDATION OF CLAIMS WITHOUT THE
RESPONDENT’S CONSENT

The Respondent’s Arguments

164. The Respondent claims it has not provided its consent for investors from the United States
and investors from the United Kingdom to join or consolidate claims arising under different
BITs into a single arbitration proceeding before a single tribunal. Likewise, it considers that
it is for the Claimants to prove such consent on the part of the Respondent.'°°

165. Nevertheless, the Respondent asserts that neither Article IX of the US-Bolivia BIT nor
Article 8 of the UK-Bolivia BIT (invoked by the Claimants as providing consent in the

106

context of these proceedings “”) contain Bolivia’s consent to jointly settle disputes between

foreign investors and Bolivia on the basis of a treaty other than the one applicable to such

foreign investors.'°”

166.In addition, Bolivia deems the dispute settlement provisions in the Treaties to be
incompatible, as under the US-Bolivia BIT only the national or company who is a party to a
dispute against the State may commence arbitration, while the UK-Bolivia BIT allows either
disputing party to do so. This means that Bolivia may file counterclaims against investors

under the UK-Bolivia BIT, but lacks such power under the US-Bolivia BIT.'®

167.Consequently, the Respondent believes that the Tribunal lacks “rationae voluntatis”
jurisdiction over the present dispute, given the Claimants’ failure to provide sufficient
evidence of the Respondent’s consent thereto. As explained by international case law and
legal scholars, and in accordance with the treaty interpretation rules set forth in Articles 31
and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (hereinafter, the “WCLT”), no two
claims may be joined or consolidated into a single proceeding without the express consent of

the State.'”

168. In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants draw a distinction between “consolidation” and

“joinder” of claims,!”°

ur

according to which only consolidation requires the express consent of
the State.""” However, the Claimants fail to explain why such consent is not necessary in the

case of a joinder of claims.'*

169. Thus, the Respondent considers that the scope of State consent under a treaty cannot be

unilaterally modified by an investor,''*

but rather, that such consent is determined by the
scope of the offer to arbitrate made by the State (Bolivia) under the relevant treaty.
Therefore, the investor may only accept what has been offered by the State,''* and Bolivia
has made no offer in these proceedings that would allow the Claimants to choose whether to

commence one or two arbitration proceedings.'°

170. Furthermore, while the Claimants argue that Bolivia has quoted no legal authority

whatsoever in support of its objection on lack of consent to consolidation,''®

the Respondent
believes that such an assertion entails a “false debate”, as it is “absurd” to insist that the
requirement of consent to a tribunal’s jurisdiction msut be supported by some legal

authority."'7

17

- On the other hand, the Respondent considers that the cases on which the Claimants rely are

fundamentally distinguishable from this arbitration: in these cases, the States did not object
to the tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis of a lack of consent to the joinder of disputes.''*

Therefore, the “implied” State consent in such cases cannot be applied to these proceedings

situation, since, in such cases, investors instituted two different arbitrations against the Czech Republic under two different
treaties, as the Czech Republic had only consented thereto. Hence, had investors in such cases wished to consolidate the
proceedings, they should have had the express consent of the State, given that the applicable treaties did not contain the
consent of the State to the joinder. Likewise, in Pan American case, the Respondent maintains that claimants distort its
content, since the tribunal never stated that, had claimants chosen to commence a single proceeding instead of two, they
would not have needed Argentina’s consent.

to alter the scope of Bolivia’s consent.''? Likewise, the Respondent submits that in Duke

120

Energy the relevant treaties were binding upon the same parties,“ whereas in these

proceedings each Claimant invokes a different consent pursuant to a different Treaty.'”!

172. Similarly, the Respondent contends that Bolivia’s consent cannot be presumed, since, as
other investment tribunals have held, a State’s consent must be “clear and unambiguous”.'”
To hold otherwise would suggest that a State party to a treaty consents to everything that is
not expressly prohibited therein, which the Respondent describes as “absurd”.'”*

173. Lastly, Bolivia submits that its consent cannot be overridden by procedural efficiency
considerations. According to the Respondent, the Claimants confuse procedural matters
under Article 17(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules with other jurisdictional matters (the
non-existence and scope of Bolivia’s consent).'* Accordingly, the UNCITRAL Rules do not
allow a tribunal to overlook a State’s consent, but rather confirm that such consent is
necessary under Article 17(5) thereof. Finally, Bolivia believes that, should only one Party

be excluded from the proceedings, such Party should be Rurelec.'”

The Claimants’ Arguments

174.The Claimants allege that that there has been no consolidation of claims in these
proceedings. According to the legal authorities and case law submitted by the Claimants,
“consolidation” is defined as “a procedural device combining two or more proceedings into
one proceeding with the result that the other tribunals cease to function, and therefore
express consent is required to consolidate proceedings.”'*° From the Claimants’ standpoint,
however, these proceedings present a different situation involving two investors who have

decided to jointly submit several claims in the context of a single proceeding. As a result, the

case law on which Bolivia relies is inapplicable to the present case, as it deals with the

consolidation of two separate arbitrations into a single proceeding.'””

175. Similarly, the Claimants contest Bolivia’s argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over
the dispute given the lack of express consent by the State to a joinder of claims in a single
proceeding when such claims have been brought by different claimants under different
treaties. They argue that the Respondent has failed to invoke any case law or legal authorities
in support of its position because there is no precedent in which claims brought by different

claimants have been dismissed on the grounds of their joint submission.'*

176. Instead, the Claimants submit that claims are often submitted jointly in multi-party
arbitrations, even under different legal instruments, provided that these are compatible (as
the Claimants believe is the case in these proceedings with the US-Bolivia and UK-Bolivia
BITs).'” The Claimants further reject the possibility that a counterclaim could be filed under

130

the UK-Bolivia BIT. In fact, the only incompatibility alleged by Bolivia” does not arise, as
the Claimants have submitted the dispute under the relevant dispute settlement provisions set

forth in each Treaty.'*"

177. Finally, the Claimants consider that, in the interest of justice and efficiency, the Tribunal
should settle the dispute in a single proceeding, since a separate filing of claims would

require the Claimants to invest much more money and effort and would lead to duplicative

case, the Claimants have not filed two different requests for arbitration, but have acted jointly.

proceedings and to a possible inconsistency between future awards. Therefore, the Tribunal

must allow the Claimants to submit their claims jointly, especially considering that Bolivia

 

has failed to explain how a joint submission of claims would adversely affect the

proceedings or to otherwise indicate which of the Claimants should be excluded. '*”

178. The Claimants consider that there is no reason to believe that, upon signing the Treaties,
Bolivia did not account for the fact that multiple claims could be heard in a single
proceeding. It is undisputed that multiple investors may jointly file claims in the context of a
single proceeding without being specifically authorized to do so under the relevant
investment treaty, and even if the State opposes such joinder of claims. Likewise, an investor
may file arbitration proceedings under different legal instruments, on the basis of the consent
which has been provided for each of such legal instruments, and even if such instruments do

not expressly provide for this possibility.'**

179. Additionally, whether the Claimants may be jointly heard in the same proceedings is a
procedural rather than a jurisdictional question. In this regard, the Tribunal has broad
discretion to rule upon this issue under the UNCITRAL Rules and Procedural Order No. 1.
The advantages of a unified proceeding in terms of efficiency and consistency are undisputed

and, in any event, Bolivia has not provided a single reason to proceed otherwise.

180.The Claimants consider that Bolivia has abandoned its claim on the argument

134

incompatibility of the BITs ™ as well as its argument that “consolidation” is at issue in these

proceedings. By opposing these proceedings, Bolivia only seeks to delay a final award, as it
has not even contested the fairness and efficiency of jointly settling claims that have been

jointly submitted, nor has it explained how such joinder of claims would adversely affect

“3
it.

181. In any event, the Claimants believe that their claims may be analyzed from the standpoint of
either of them, as the damages are the same. Should the Tribunal consider these claims from

GAI’s standpoint, it would find that GAI would have directly lost the market value arising

out of the spot price and effective means claims, without having to consider any question
pertaining to Rurelec, as Rurelec’s loss would be entirely compensated by a full damages
award in favour of GAI. On the other hand, should the Tribunal decline jurisdiction over
GAI’s claims, then it might consider analyzing Rurelec’s stake in EGSA, which is the same
as GAI’s. As regards regulatory measures, the losses incurred by both of the Claimants
would also be the same. If the Tribunal considers Rurelec’s claims, then Rurelec’s loss
would be the market value of its shareholding in EGSA as of the valuation date, as well as
the related loss arising from the effective means and spot price claims. In this context, it
would not be necessary to consider any other matter pertaining to GAI, as GAI’s loss would
have been entirely redressed by a full damages award in favour of Rurelec. If the Tribunal
were to decline jurisdiction over Rurelec’s claims, it should have to consider GAI’s claims.
The valuation of GAI’s shareholding in EGSA is the same as Rurelec’s; hence, the damages

calculation for both Claimants would be the same.'**

B. ALLEGED LACK OF RURELEC’S CAPACITY AS AN INVESTOR, AS WELL AS OF A
PROTECTED INVESTMENT

The Respondent’s Arguments

182. Bolivia considers Rurelec lacks standing to have its dispute with Bolivia heard in this
arbitration, as Rurelec cannot be regarded an “investor” and has not made any “investment”
pursuant to the UK-Bolivia BIT. Therefore, Bolivia’s alleged consent could not have been

provided.

183. First, and relying on international case law and the VCLT, the Respondent claims that
Rurelec has the burden of proof with respect to both the alleged existence of an “investment”
and its status as an “investor”. Rurelec must prove that it acquired a direct ownership interest
or, if allowed for under the UK-Bolivia BIT, an indirect ownership interest in EGSA prior to
the dispute. However, neither of these points has been proven and the Tribunal should thus

decline jurisdiction over the dispute.'*”

184. Secondly, in the Respondent’s view, the documents submitted by the Claimants do not prove
an investment by Rurelec in GAI in January 2006. Assuming arguendo that such
documentation were sufficient, which the Respondent disputes, it would merely prove the
possible acquisition of an indirect ownership interest in EGSA on 29 June 2009, the date on
which the chain of control between EGSA and Rurelec would have been established.’
Using this date, the major capital investments in new productive capacity undertaken by
EGSA between 2006 and 2008 which the Claimants repeatedly cite, would have taken place
before Rurelec held any ownership interest in EGSA. In any event, the date on which the
possible acquisition of an indirect ownership stake might have taken place is irrelevant, as
there is no document demonstrative actual payment for the investment, and therefore no

investment exists.

185. Thirdly, if Rurelec had invested in EGSA, such an investment would be an indirect
investment made through Birdsong, BIE, and GAI. BIE and Birdsong Overseas Limited are

incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands,'”

a territory to which the

provisions of the UK-Bolivia BIT are not applicable. In addition, as an indirect investment,

and in contrast to the situation under the US-Bolivia BIT, it would not be protected under the

UK-Bolivia BIT. In this regard, Respondent claims that the US-Bolivia BIT contains a broad

definition of investment which includes “every kind of investment owned or controlled
o> 140

directly or indirectly by that national or company”, whereas the UK-Bolivia BIT makes no

reference to a direct or indirect investment holding.

186. On the other hand, according to the Respondent’s interpretation of Articles II to V of the US-
Bolivia BIT, protected investments must be “of” nationals or companies “of” each
Contracting Party, thus requiring a direct ownership relationship between the investment and
the national of a Contracting Party for the latter to be considered an investor. This
interpretation is supported by the terms “own” and “owner” included in Article V(2) of the
US-Bolivia BIT which, according to the Respondent’s interpretation, imply ownership or

legal right to hold the shares.

 

(Exhibit RL-39); Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L. v. Republic of El Salvador (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26), Award, 2 August 2006
(Oreamuno Blanco, Landy and von Wobeser) (Exhibit RL-40).

8 The Respondent believes that it is such date that should be taken as a reference, rather than the date alleged by the
Claimant: it appears on the Share Certificate that evidences the ownership interests of Birdsong in BIE (Exhibit C-35).

187. Since the UK-Bolivia BIT makes no reference to “direct or indirect” ownership, the case law

‘41 Moreover, the

cited by the Respondent requires that the protected investment be direct.
Respondent stresses that 13 out of the 22 BITs signed by Bolivia contain said phrase,
whereas 8 do not. Thus, if the parties to the UK-Bolivia BIT had intended to protect
indirect—and not just direct—investments, they would have made a specific reference

thereto, as was the case in other treaties.

188. Hence, Respondent submits that an indirect investment in EGSA is not protected under the
UK-Bolivia BIT.” It also considers that the cases cited by the Claimants did not consider
the existence of terms confirming the inclusion of indirect investments in the relevant treaties
(as is the case, in the Respondent’s opinion, under the UK-Bolivia BIT). Nor did such cases
consider the State’s position upon signing different treaties or the difference between direct

yee 3
and indirect investments. *

189.The Respondent further argues that the provisions of the UK-Bolivia BIT only protect

“capital” investments.'“ This argument has been upheld by case law and doctrine in light of

s 145

the inherent meaning of the term “investment”. Consequently, a contribution in cash or

some other economic contribution is required for an investment to be protected under the
UK-Bolivia BIT. As stated by the Respondent, Rurelec made no capital investment in

Bolivia pursuant to the UK-Bolivia BIT.

190. Even assuming that Rurelec is an investor and that the UK-Bolivia BIT protects indirect
investments, the Respondent submits that Rurelec has made no contribution “within” the

territory of Bolivia. It further states that the distinction drawn by the Claimants between

“capital investment” and “investment” in the different versions of the UK-Bolivia BIT? is

irrelevant, as Bolivia’s objection does not rely on such distinction.

191. Bolivia bases its objection is based on the objective notion of the term “investment”, which
implies a monetary contribution or input in the host State. Thus, the Respondent challenges

the White Industries'”

case cited by the Claimants, where the tribunal disregarded the
relevance of a monetary contribution or input, but nevertheless deemed it important to
confirm that the foreign investor had indeed made such contribution or input in that case.'**
Likewise, in Romak and Alps Finance’ (which, according to Bolivia, have been
misinterpreted by Claimants as dealing with special circumstances), the tribunal dealt with

the facts of the case separately from the inherent meaning of the term “investment”,

contradicting the Claimants’ reading of these cases.'°

192. In addition, Rurelec would have to prove the monetary or other economic contribution it
alleges to have made in the territory of Bolivia.'*' The Respondent argues that the Claimants
have failed to show this.'” The only thing that has been proven is the possible acquisition of
an indirect ownership interest in EGSA in 2009 (ten years following the capital contributions
in Bolivian territory relating to the capitalization of EGSA). No evidence has been submitted
to prove that such an investment was made through a monetary or other economic
contribution, or that it was made in Bolivian territory. The Respondent submits that EGSA’s

shareholders have made no capital contributions since 1999, and that the alleged

'2 Reply on Jurisdiction, 9103-112. In this regard, the Respondent states that there is no evidence whatsoever that Rurelec
has paid USD 35 million for the purchase of the shares in EGSA. Also, the investments in generation equipment were made
without the Claimants’ own capital contribution. As regards the alleged technical support mentioned by the Claimants in their
Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 433, no evidence has been submitted and, in any case, the technical support received by
EGSA came from abroad, through subcontractors from Independent Power Operation Ltd. (See Exhibit R-103). Moreover, at
least four out of the seven Jenbacher engines (which Claimants include as Rurelec’s contribution) already belonged to EGSA
since April 2005, that is, several months prior to Rurelec’s alleged investment in Bolivia. Ultimately, the Respondent claims,
it is not correct to say that Rurelec’s conduct has helped to remedy the difficult financial situation of EGSA, as its
indebtedness had been evident since 2008. Fitch Ratings had downgraded EGSA’s credit rating and by 2009 it had exhausted
all its financing sources, having at its disposal USD 3 millions in cash in 2010. This, coupled with the distribution of
dividends qualified as “conservative” by the Claimants, led to a decapitalization of EGSA (See Exhibits R-104, R-105 and
R-106). See Transcript (English), Day 1, 2 April 2013, 172:11-173:19.

Page 69 of 208

“investments” made by the Claimants in 2006 and 2007 cannot be attributed to the

Claimants, as Rurelec did not have an indirect shareholding in EGSA at the time.

193. Lastly, since EGSA’s capitalization in 1999 (10 years prior to Rurelec’s alleged acquisition
of an indirect ownership interest), there have been no capital contributions by EGSA’s
shareholders. Neither the purchase of the two engines owned by Energais in Bolivia
(decommissioned, disassembled, and stored at EGSA), nor Rurelec’s interest in Energais can

be deemed as investments under the UK-Bolivia BIT.’

194. For the foregoing reasons, Rurelec does not qualify as an investor and its alleged investment
cannot be considered a “protected investment” under the UK-Bolivia BIT. Therefore, the

Tribunal lacks jurisdiction “rationae personae” over this dispute.

195.The Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ arguments in support of Rurelec’s alleged
acquisition in EGSA'™ fall short. Bolivia denies Rurelec’s acquisition of an indirect

shareholding in EGSA in 2006 or 2009'* for the following reasons:

(a) The Claimants have provided no evidence of any payment for this acquisition. They
merely restate the price included in a stock purchase agreement dated 12 December
2005, a share transfer dated 5 January 2006, and a press release issued by Rurelec on 5
January 2006.'° The conditions under which such payment took place are likewise not

proven.

o

The documents submitted by the Claimants do not prove the shareholding chain linking
Rurelec and EGSA since 2006, but rather an alleged indirect investment made by
Rurelec in 2009. Only a letter from Nerine Fiduciaries to its Freshfields attorneys dated
26 October 2012 (same date on which Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction) would link Birdsong to EGSA before 2009.'* No other document from

any of the other intervening entities has been submitted to confirm that the BIE shares

Bolivia states that it does not show whether a payment has been made. It provides for some deferred payments but it is
uncertain whether they have been made or not. Moreover, the last payment was scheduled for 2008, which makes it
impossible for the 2006 Share Transfer (Exhibit C-214) to prove any payment (a total of USD 35 millions) in 2006 if the
aggregate amount had not yet been paid. The same happens with Rurelec’s press release (Exhibit C-215),

'5§ T etter from Nerine Fiduciaries to Freshfields dated 26 October 2012 (Exhibit C-226).

were actually owned by Birdsong. Likewise, no explanation has been provided as to
why Birdsong (if it really acquired the shares in 2006) waited until 2009 to register
them under its name. Nor is there evidence that Birdsong was wholly owned by

Rurelec.'” In any event, such documents are not official documents.!

(c

Mr Peter Earl’s position as President of EGSA’s Board of Directors does not prove that

EGSA’s shares have been owned, even indirectly, by Rurelec. Moreover, his attendance

as President of the Board of Directors at the official opening of EGSA’s new facilities is

not “exceptional”.'*'

196.In light of the above, Bolivia states that the Claimants have failed to provide evidence of
Rurelec’s payment for the allegedly acquired shares or of an economic contribution made in
Bolivian territory. Accordingly, the Respondent claims that there has been no protected
investment made under the Treaty, which results in the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction

rationae personae.

The Claimants’ Arguments

197. Firstly, the Claimants submit that Rurelec acquired its indirect majority stake in EGSA on 6
January 2006,'° and that Rurelec was already EGSA’s majority shareholder during the
period of EGSA’s investments to improve its electricity generation capacity between 2006
and 2007. The Claimants deny that such stake was acquired at a later date—in June 2009—
and assert that (i) Bolivia requested specific documents from the Claimants on this matter on
7 September 2012 and Rurelec submitted said documentation; (ii) as shown by such
documents, the execution and delivery of the stock transfer dated 5 January 2005 shows that
the transaction was completed on 6 January 2006 with the payment of USD 35 million; (iii)
other ancillary documents likewise confirm that Rurelec made its investment in 2006;'* and
(iv) the Respondent became aware of Rurelec’s investment in EGSA prior to 2009, as proven

by the fact that in March 2007, Bolivian authorities, along with Mr Earl and the United

said documents fail to show how many shares form Birdsong’s capital, which makes it impossible to determine Rurelec’s

press releases which mention the investments made in Bolivia for power generation.

Kingdom’s Ambassador to Bolivia, attended the inauguration ceremony for EGSA’s new

GCH-11 unit.’

198. The Claimants assert that they have provided sufficient evidence that Rurelec acquired an
indirect majority stake in EGSA and claim that Bolivia has not disproven this, such that
Bolivia’s objection should be dismissed. The Claimants allege that the price of USD 35
million for the purchase of EGSA was fully paid, as shown by the 2006 and 2007 annual
reports and the audits performed.'® Following the acquisition, and until June 2009, BIE’s
shares were held in escrow by entities designated for the benefit of Birdsong, as per

corporate practice.

199. Secondly, the Claimants consider that the UK-Bolivia BIT does protect indirect investments,
as it covers “every kind of asset” as well as “any form of participation in a company”, and
the list of protected investments included therein is non-exhaustive. Indirect shareholdings
are an asset and therefore, a form of participation in a company, which makes them protected
investments under the UK-Bolivia BIT. This conclusion is supported by extensive arbitral

practice,'® and the cases submitted by Bolivia are inapposite to the case at hand.

200. The Claimants insist that Rurelec’s indirect shareholding in EGSA must be deemed an
“investment” according to the list of examples provided by the Treaty, since the list includes
“shares in [...] a company and any other form of participation in a company.” The latter is a
broad definition and the absence of more specific language (“directly or indirectly”) cannot
narrow its scope, as suggested by the Respondent. Bolivia has failed to prove that the UK-

Bolivia BIT deliberately excluded indirect investments.’ According to the Claimants,

BIT as covering indirect investments.'*

-Bolivia’s argument that investments should be made directly by nationals or companies for
them to be protected by a BIT is rejected by international case law.'® In turn, case law and

' rebut the theory that the presence of third-party

legal scholars cited by the Claimants
intermediary companies used in order to obtain a stake in EGSA precludes Rurelec from

being considered an investor under the UK-Bolivia BIT.

 

202. Thirdly, the Claimants object to the definition of “investment” suggested by Bolivia, which
requires a capital contribution in Bolivian territory (“capital investment”), and also reject the
assertion that Rurelec has made no capital investment and consequently cannot be protected
under the UK-Bolivia BIT.'" Said statement applies a rule which has been created
exclusively by ICSID case law based on the ICSID Convention, and which is inapplicable to

the present dispute.'”

203. Conversely, the Claimants consider that they have made major investments in Bolivia. ~ In

addition, Rurelec and the Government of Bolivia conducted a project aimed at providing
electricity to underserved rural areas, and agreed that Rurelec would finance a subsidy to

low-income consumers known as the “dignity tariff’. This was financed by Rurelec through

its returns on investments, deferred dividends, commercial loans, and other financing sources

for EGSA.'"

According to the Claimants, Bolivia’s interpretation of the definition of “protected
investment” is incorrect and distorts the true meaning that the UK-Bolivia BIT intended to
give to this term, depriving it of its effet utile. The Respondent relies on the Spanish version
of the UK-Bolivia BIT and refers to the concept of “returns” (rentas) in Article 1(b)
thereof.” In this version, the concept of “capital investment” (inversién de capital) is
defined within the concept of “returns”. However, the English version of the Treaty only
uses the term “investment”,!” which, in the Claimants’ opinion, is the concept actually
defined by the UK-Bolivia BIT. Under the VCLT, in case of any inconsistency between
different versions of the same treaty, the meaning that best reconciles both texts shall prevail,
which in this case is the meaning set forth in the English version, since it includes a broad
definition of investment which accurately reflects both the drafters’ intention and the object

and purpose of the UK-Bolivia BIT.

The Claimants also insist that the case law submitted by the Respondent to determine the
definition of “investment” is inappropriate. On the one hand, Bolivia cites cases where a
narrow definition of investment is used in connection with Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention, which is inapplicable in this case. On the other hand, the cases under the
UNCITRAL Rules cited by Bolivia constitute a minority position distinguishable on their

facts from these proceedings.'”

In any event, the Claimants assert that, if Respondent’s definition of “investment” were to be
applied, Rurelec’s investment would still fall within the scope thereof on account of its
contributions to the Bolivian economy mentioned above.' Based on the report from
Bolivia’s witness, Marta Bejarano, Bolivia states that Rurelec made no contribution in

EGSA using its own funds, but rather drained capital from EGSA and increased its

indebtedness. This latter statement, however, has been rebutted by the Claimants’ witness

Marcelo Blanco.'”

207. Furthermore, the Claimants reject the requirement that the investment be made in Bolivian
territory. From the Claimants’ viewpoint, references to territory relate to the host Contracting
Party which would benefit from the investment, not the place where the contribution must
take place." If the relevant criterion were the place where the contribution is made, any
investor acquiring an interest in a company (as is the case of Rurelec) would be deprived of
the protection under the BITs merely because it purchased from the initial investor (in this
case, GAI) rather than making a direct capital contribution. However, case law cited by the
Claimants states that the BIT protects foreign investors who have acquired a previously
existing investment: the investment remains even if the investor changes.'*!

208. In any event, the Claimants consider that Bolivia’s additional criterion of a “contribution” in
Bolivian territory has been complied with, given that Rurelec paid for the acquisition of its
shares in EGSA and thus, such contribution must be deemed an investment in Bolivia.’
This interpretation would be consistent with the Quiborax decision'® cited by the
Respondent. If we apply the facts of Quiborax to these proceedings, the payment of
USD 35 million made by Rurelec for the acquisition of a controlling interest in EGSA would
amount to a “contribution” pursuant to the definition provided in Quiborax.'™ As a result,

Bolivia’s objection should be rejected.

209. In addition, the Claimants allege that Rurelec has made other important contributions in
Bolivia, such as the obligations incurred in connection with the USD 20 million loan granted
to EGSA by the Corporacién Andina de Fomento (hereinafter, the “CAF’”), or the expertise
and know-how provided to EGSA’s personnel and operations. This important contribution
has even been acknowledged by independent third parties, such as the credit rating agency,

Fitch."

210.Lastly, the Claimants consider that both Rurelec’s shareholding in Energais and the

2

Worthington engines constitute protected investments under the UK-Bolivia BIT. In
accordance with Article 5(2) thereof, measures taken by the Respondent in respect of the
Bolivian subsidiary of a UK investor (such as its expropriation in this case) require just and
effective compensation. Moreover, the Worthington engines constitute movable property
under Article 1(a)(i) of the UK-Bolivia BIT, and therefore Rurelec’s indirect interest in such

movable property is protected.'*°

C. ALLEGED DENIAL OF BENEFITS TO GAI

The Respondent’s Arguments

- According to the Respondent, Article XII of the US-Bolivia BIT allows any of the

Contracting Parties (in this case, Bolivia) to deny the benefits therein to a company of the
other Contracting Party. For that purpose, two conditions must be complied with, both of
which are met by GAT: (i) ownership by nationals of a third State (GAI’s shareholder, BIE—
an entity created by IEL and later acquired by Birdsong—has always been domiciled in the
British Virgin Islands); and (ii) not carrying out any substantial business activities in the
territory of the United States. GAI is a “special purpose vehicle” created to acquire and hold
the new shares EGSA would issue as a result of its capitalization plan.'*” Since both
requirements are met, the Respondent may deny the benefits of the US-Bolivia BIT, which
precludes its consent to arbitration under such Treaty from being invoked in these

proceedings. Consequently, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over GAI’s claims.

212. The Respondent explains that it has properly exercised its right to deny the benefits under the

US-Bolivia BIT to GAI in accordance with Article XII thereof," as it timely invoked such
provision pursuant to the UNCITRAL Rules and International Law in response to the
Claimants’ Statement of Claim. The Claimants reject such statement and submit that Bolivia
purports to apply Article XII of the Treaty retroactively.'®” In turn, Bolivia points out that the
Claimants’ reasoning is contrary to Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules and to the case
law cited by the Claimants, since in the absence of any special provision in the Treaty

limiting the application of the denial of benefits clause, general provisions governing the

a

. On the other hand, the Claimants consider that the denial of benefits cannot operate ex tunc,

191

as this would breach investors’ legitimate expectations.” However, the Respondent asserts

that such expectations were not violated in GAI’s case, since its investment was made in the
mid-90s and the US-Bolivia BIT entered into force in 2001. Additionally, Bolivia argues that
a legitimate expectation cannot be based on a State’s failure to exercise a right to which it is
entitled. The future possibility of a denial of benefits was part of the legal framework of the
US-Bolivia BIT. Thus, the Claimants were aware of the possibility that Bolivia might

exercise such rights following the Treaty’s entry into force.'””

214. As regards the absence of substantial activities in the US, the Claimants allege that the
application of the denial of benefits clause on that basis would lead to an unfair result, given

that the Respondent required GAI’s establishment as part of EGSA’s capitalization
process.'* According to the Respondent, such statement is false, since neither the Bidding
Rules nor the Capitalization Agreement required that the “subscribing company” for
acquiring shares in EGSA be a “special purpose vehicle”. Nor they did impose nationality
requirements or restrict the commercial activities to be undertaken by such subscribing

194
company.

215.Therefore, GPU was free to choose the company that would participate in the bidding
process as the subscribing company to acquire EGSA’s shares. However, it decided to create
a “vehicle” in the State of Delaware (GAI) without any commercial activity in the United

' Reply on Jurisdiction, 49[132-137. The Respondent refers to the Bidding Rules (Exhibit C-7), which define “Stock
Subscribing Company” as “the company that shall subscribe the Subscription Shares” (Article 1) [Tribunal’s Translation].
Moreover, Article 2.1 stated that “the bidding company may be: 2.1.1 Electricity Company [...] 2.1.2 Consortium of Related
Companies [...] 2.1.3 Specific Company. A juridical person constituted exclusively for the purposes of participating in the

considered a “traditional holding company,”!°

and (iii) GAI’s commercial activities

. According to the Claimants, the application of Article XII of the US-Bolivia BIT would
violate the international principle of pacta sunt servanda and would contravene the object
and purpose of investment treaties (the promotion of investments based on rationality and
predictability). According to the case law submitted in these proceedings, the denial of
benefits cannot apply retroactively, as sought by the Respondent, that is, once the investment
has been made, since the purpose of such provision is to give a State the opportunity to alert
investors in advance that they are no longer afforded protection under the relevant treaty,

thereby protecting the legitimate expectations such investors may have.” Denial of benefits

(iii) included such investment in the Nationalisation Decree, and (iv) now that arbitration
proceedings have been initiated and having received all the returns on the investment,
purports to deny the benefits of BIT protection to the investment holders. For the foregoing
reasons, the Tribunal cannot accept the retroactive application of Article XII of the US-

Bolivia BIT.”

- In addition, the Claimants consider that Bolivia cannot deny benefits under Article XII of the
US-Bolivia BIT because the conditions set forth therein have not been met, especially the
absence of “substantial business activities” in the United States. The Claimants stress that the

US-Bolivia BIT does not provide a defi

 

ion of “substantial business activities”. If the
VCLT were applied, the term “substantial” would not be a synonym of “large”, as the
decisive question would be the materiality and not the magnitude of the business activity.
This is the interpretation provided by arbitral case law. Therefore, GAI has indeed conducted
substantial commercial activities in the United States, since it maintains offices in said
territory, holds shareholders’ meetings in Ohio as well as Board of Directors’ meetings,
prepares the minutes of said meetings, etc., thereby fulfilling the conditions described in

. 202
arbitral case law.

.In addition to the allegations on the prospective application of the denial of benefits,” the
Claimants consider that such provision cannot be understood, as argued by the Respondent,
as “[a] plea that the arbitral tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised no later than
in the statement of defense,” within the meaning of Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL
Rules.™ Instead, it is an act that forms the basis for such a plea. The UNCITRAL Rules set
out the procedural deadline beyond which an existing jurisdictional obstacle will be waived,
but the deadline for creating such an obstacle is a matter of substance, governed by
international law.” In this regard, it is a well-established principle that “jurisdiction is to be

determined in light of the situation as it exists on the date the judicial proceedings are

instituted.” Moreover, “once established, jurisdiction cannot be defeated. It simply is not

affected by subsequent events.”””
219. In the Claimants’ opinion, the denial-of-benefits clause may affect an investor’s claims in

two different ways, neither of which can operate retroactively:

(a) The State deprives the claimant of all substantive protections of the BIT, and that
measure is in line with the BIT. All claims would thus be inadmissible. However, if the
State has not denied benefits at the moment it takes measures on the grounds that the
treaty has been violated, then all protections are at that moment in place, and a breach of
the Treaty can occur. By later denying the benefits of the Treaty, the State cannot undo
the legal reality of a treaty breach—it can only prevent its subsequent actions from

violating the Treaty.

o

The State deprives the claimant of the benefit of its consent to arbitration as set forth in
the BIT, preventing claims from being adjudicated by an arbitral tribunal. However, if
the State has not denied benefits at the moment when the claimant initiates arbitration,
then the State’s consent is still in place, and the offer to arbitrate is accepted by the
investor and transformed into an irrevocable agreement. By later denying the benefits of
the Treaty, the State cannot withdraw a consent that has already been accepted. It can
only prevent the investor from initiating arbitrations with respect to future disputes.”
220. In this case, the disputed events took place in May 2010. At that time, the Respondent had
not invoked the denial-of-benefits clause. Therefore, the full range of substantive protections
of the US-Bolivia BIT applied to the Claimants and their investment. Moreover, to the extent
that Bolivia’s conduct was contrary to the terms of the Treaty, GAI immediately acquired a
right to compensation. Similarly, the Claimants initiated this arbitration in November 2010,
two years before Bolivia sought to withdraw its treaty benefits. However, Bolivia accepted
the offer to arbitrate and, in turn, GAI had long since availed itself of the benefit of the
arbitration clause of the US-Bolivia BIT. Additionally, the Respondent was at all times

aware of the Claimants’ investment in Bolivia."

D. ALLEGED PRESENTATION OF NEW CLAIMS NOT PROTECTED BY THE TREATIES

The Respondent’s Arguments

222. According to the Respondent, the Claimants have filed New Claims in the Statement of
Claim, which had not been included in the Notice of Dispute or in the Notice of Arbitration.
The New Claims refer to violations of the Treaties on the part of Bolivia in connection with:
(i) electricity spot prices; (ii) capacity payments; and (iii) the two Worthington engines. The
Respondent alleges that, by way of this submission—which it describes as “untimely”—the
Treaties were violated in two respects (Article IX of the US-Bolivia BIT and Article 8 of the
UK-Bolivia BIT):

(a) The conditions necessary for the notice of New Claims have not been fulfilled. The term
“dispute” in the Notice of Arbitration and the term “dispute” in the Statement of Claim
are used differently, and the New Claims are included in the latter, despite not having
been included in the former (neither in the Notices dated 13 May 2010 nor in those

invoked in the same document).”""

o

The cooling-off period established in the Treaties for the possible amicable settlement
of the dispute was not fulfilled. This breach would have occurred even if the New
Claims had been included in the Notice of Arbitration, since the Respondent would still
not have had an opportunity to avail itself of the period of amicable consultations.
Furthermore, during the meetings held between July 2010 and March 2011, the
compensation to be granted to the Claimants due to the nationalisation was discussed,

but not the New Claims.”*

223. According to the Respondent, the Claimants are asking the Tribunal to hear new claims, and
forcing Bolivia to respond to them in too short a period of time considering their costs and
complexity. Pursuant to recent case law, these New Claims should be dismissed by the
Tribunal, which lacks jurisdiction to hear them because the conditions established by the

Treaties in this regard have not been met."?

224. In its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent states that the Claimants have failed to prove
two points in connection with the New Claims: (i) prior notification of such claims to
Bolivia, and (ii) that such claims were mentioned during negotiations between the Parties.
Therefore, the Tribunal must decide whether Bolivia gave its consent to arbitrate these New
Claims and whether the conditions concerning notification of disputes and cooling off were

met.

225.In response to the statements made by the Claimants concerning Article IX of the US-

*!5 and based on

Bolivia BIT,”* the Respondent holds that, in addition to its prior arguments
Murphy,” a dispute arises at the time that an investor alleges a treaty violation. Thus, the
period of three months required under the US-Bolivia BIT starts running on the date of such
allegation, which the investor must prove. Hence, GAI has the burden of proving that Bolivia
became aware of a dispute under the Treaty concerning the New Claims at least three months
before the commencement of this proceeding. However, this evidence has not been

submitted.”

226. Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the Claimants contradict themselves in regards to
the requirement of prior notification under the US-Bolivia BIT. Although they initially

acknowledged its mandatory nature when giving written notice to Bolivia of the dispute

218

regarding expropriation,” they now deny the application of this requirement in respect of

the New Claims, alleging that the notice and cooling off requirements are not mandatory or

(UNCITRAL ~ PCA Case No. 2010-9), Award on Jurisdiction, 10 February 2012 (Dupuy, Bernardez and Lalonde) (Exhibit
RL-29).

2 The Respondent notes that in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 9964, 72, and 73, the Claimants have only affirmed
that Bolivia made no attempt to amicably settle the New Claims, that negotiations on nationalisation were unsuccessful and
that Bolivia’s stance in this arbitration confirms the scarce possibilities that an agreement would have been reached. See {236
infra. Additionally, the Respondent considers in its allegations of 14 January 2013 that Teinver S.A., Transportes de
Cercanias S.A y Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/90/1), Decision on
Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012 (Buergenthal, Alvarez and Hossain) (Exhibit CL-151), reinforces Bolivia's stance in this
respect. This is so because the circumstances of such case and of this case are very different: here, there has been no kind of
negotiation on the New Claims (unlike in the mentioned case). Therefore, the prior negotiation requirement has not been
observed. See Transcript (English), Day 1, 2 April 2013, 246:17-247:15.

or (ii) that negotiations on the New Claims would not have succeeded because the

negotiations on nationalisation did not succeed.”

229. Lastly, the Respondent argues that considerations of cost and “dilatory nature” cannot justify

ignoring limitations on Bolivia’s consent under the Treaties.””°

230. Next, Bolivia asserts that the Claimants “opportunistic” allegations were made “for the first
time in this arbitration” that the measures giving rise to the New Claims were preliminary
steps that culminated in the nationalisation, such that the New Claims were subsumed within
the notification regarding the nationalisation.”’ The Respondent considers that such

allegations are unsustainable for the following reasons:

(a) Both the Notice of Dispute and the definition of “dispute” in the Notice of Arbitration

demonstrate the limited nature of the single dispute notified to the Respondent.”*

o

The Claimants acknowledge that the notifications of May 2012 referred to “[t]he
dispute [that] arises out of the Bolivian Government’s nationalisation of Rurelec’s
indirect shareholding in [EGSA] by means of Supreme Decree No. 0493 dated 1 May
2010.” Nonetheless, the New Claims concerning the PBP and spot prices cannot
“arise out of’ the 2010 Supreme Decree, since they stem from measures adopted in

2007 and 2008, respectively.”

(c

The Claimants have not submitted any evidence that the measures that gave rise to the
New Claims were preliminary to the nationalisation of their investment.”"' In any case,
this argument contradicts the terms in which they present their claims, since they have

wo «93
never alleged an indirect expropriation.”

should be considered as such. In any case, the New Claims have no relation whatsoever to nationalisation. See Transcript

(d) The argument according to which the Claimants reserved the right to add facts and
arguments to support their claim is “absurd”. If the cases that define the notion of

°33 are considered, it is clear that the New Claims would not

“dispute” or “controversy
be considered as related to the dispute on nationalisation.“ In any case, no relationship
between the facts, applicable law, and the chronology underlying the New Claims and

nationalisation has been established.”

(e

The Claimants’ have also included in their New Claims the claim for the Worthington
engines, and both Parties agree that these engines were not within the scope of

application of the Nationalisation Decree.”*

23

. According to the Respondent, the Claimants suggest that negotiations on compensation for
the nationalisation were “amicable” and provided an opportunity to negotiate on the New
Claims. However, the New Claims were never discussed in the consultations and meetings
held on the assessment of EGSA’s equity for the calculation of the compensation owed for
the nationalisation.”” This is confirmed by the Claimants themselves in their Statement of

«93 . «diction 23
Claim™* and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.”

Moreover, the Respondent adds that it
only became aware of the New Claims after the submission of the Statement of Claim,
months after the amicable consultations concluded. The Claimants themselves acknowledged
that they have “raised these specific issues for the first time during the legal and

240

quantification exercise that the filing of a Statement of Claim entails, so that it is

impossible for these to have been negotiated beforehand.™"!

hear the New Claims raised by the Claimants.

The Claimants’ Arguments

233.In the Claimants’ view, the “New Claims” have been properly submitted within this
arbitration and, thus, no Treaty provisions have been breached, since such claims are
encompassed within the same dispute (i.e., nationalisation).*”

234. Concerning the amicable consultations period invoked by the Respondent, the Claimants
conclude that (i) the US-Bolivia BIT does not require prior notification of the dispute, so that

the argument in relation to GAI would not hold;**

(ii) the amicable consultation period is a
procedural and not a jurisdictional matter (as found in the case law cited), such that
non-observance of this requirement does not alter the Tribunal’s jurisdiction; and (iii) in
any event, the Claimants have actually fulfilled such obligation, since all “New Claims”
relate to the notified nationalisation. In addition, in the notification letter and in the Notice of
Arbitration itself, the Claimants reserved the right to add facts and legal issues regarding the
claims made.™**
235.The Claimants’ cite certain precedents to support the conclusion that it is not compulsory to
send a separate notice or apply the period of amicable consultations when claims relate to the
same dispute.’ The cases relied upon by the Respondent are irrelevant, because they deal
with situations in which (i) the claimant had not sent a notice of arbitration (a situation not

faced in this arbitration), or (ii) the tribunal classified the claims as “inappropriate” because

*8 The UK-Bolivia BIT establishes that once an agreement has not been reached after the amicable consultation period and
six months have passed since one of the parties notified the other of the existence of the dispute, the relevant arbitration may
be commenced. On the contrary, the US-Bolivia BIT simply refers to the lapse of three months for any of the parties to
submit the dispute to mandatory arbitration, with no additional requirements.

they were made out of context, in an untimely manner, or related to different legislation than

the one that had been invoked.”

236. Ultimately, the Claimants consider that they have complied with the amicable consultation
period, since they have attempted to reach an agreement with Bolivia in order to obtain fair
compensation for the nationalisation of their investments. Nonetheless, after four meetings
held to that effect, no compensation was offered. It makes no sense for Bolivia to require the
Claimants to undergo an amicable consultation period after having qualified the purported
“New Claims” as “frivolous” and “not even claims under the Treaties or international law”.
This would force the Claimants to start new negotiations in which Bolivia would not
participate, making it necessary to start a new arbitration, convene a new tribunal, and debate
the same issues again.”* Requiring futile amicable conversations prior to the arbitration
would be unnecessarily stringent, formalist, and it would not serve the interests of the

Parties. This vision is in accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT.””

237. Therefore, it would be unreasonable to deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction to hear three
claims based on a purportedly defective notification, especially given that they are part of a
wider claim, with respect to which negotiations were not successful and which Bolivia has
shown no intention to settle. In any event, and as previously explained by the Claimants,””

there would be no use in requiring negotiations concerning claims connected to the spot

prices, PBP and Worthington engines, considering the attitude and the statements made by

Bolivia in the course of the proceedings.”

238. Hence, the Claimants’ efforts to settle their dispute with the Respondent have been both
lengthy and unsuccessful. Under these circumstances, the Treaties do not impose additional
requirements, and the Tribunal must accept its jurisdiction over the claims at issue. In any
event, the Claimants consider that they have complied with the notification and amicable
consultation requirements. Thus, based on the Respondent’s own arguments, since the
measures relating to the spot prices, PBP and Worthington engines were implemented in the
context of the nationalisation of the electricity sector, there should be no need for a separate

notification of such claims, since these would be included within the nationalisation itself.”

E. PURPORTED DOMESTIC NATURE OF THE NEW CLAIMS

The Respondent’s Arguments

239. According to the Respondent, the New Claims fall within the exclusive scope of Bolivian
law, and cannot be considered international disputes under the Treaties. The Tribunal should
thus find that, as per the VCLT” rules of interpretation and Articles IX(1) and 8(1) of the US-
Bolivia BIT and the UK-Bolivia BIT, respectively, the Respondent has not given its consent

to have such domestic claims heard in these proceedings.”

240. On the basis of Iberdrola v. Guatemala,” Bolivia argues that it has not given its consent to
arbitrate any investment-related dispute, but only disputes “concerning an obligation [of
Bolivia] under this Agreement” in accordance with Article 8(1) of the UK-Bolivia BIT.**
Furthermore, it interprets Article IX(1) of the US-Bolivia BIT accordingly, including
disputes “arising out of an [...] alleged breach of any right conferred, created or recognized

by this Treaty”, as well as those arising out of an “investment authorization” or an
“investment agreement’ (none of which exist in the present case). Once more, the consent

granted by Bolivia is limited to disputes regarding the obligations set forth in the Treaties.

241. In any case, Bolivia considers that the Tribunal must undertake its own characterization of

the legal nature of the New Claims in accordance with the international case law cited”*° and

the principle that a true “treaty claim” requires investors to demonstrate through clear and
precise reasoning which acts and conduct are attributable to the State and constitute

violations of the relevant treaty or customary international law.”””

242. As regards the New Claim concerning the spot price, the Respondent alleges that the
Claimants seek a determination from the Tribunal on whether the price to be applied to
electricity generators should be (i) the one set forth in Supreme Decree No. 26099 of 2
March 2001 or (ii) the one set forth in Supreme Decree No. 29599.** Ultimately, the
Respondent considers that the Tribunal is being requested to determine whether the

modification is compatible with the previously existing regulatory framework.

243. After outlining the evolution of the regulations governing the electricity sector,” the

Respondent alleges that the reform implemented by Supreme Decree No. 29599 sought to

260 +

mitigate the effect of the formula set forth in the prior rules and regulations: in peak hours,

 

the most inefficient generation units (in terms of costs and environmental damage), which
contributed very little power to the system, became the Marginal Generation Unit” and set
the price that all generators would receive for each kW/h contributed to the system. Thus, the
price of electricity would increase dramatically at peak production times, out of proportion
with the true cost of electricity produced by the other generation units. This was detrimental
to consumers and resulted in a “windfall profit” for generators. The previous system also did
not encourage companies to acquire more efficient equipment, as in the case of EGSA,

which had the most inefficient equipment in Bolivia.

244. Supreme Decree No. 29599 removed from the spot price calculation formula all generation
units that distorted such calculation, provided that they met two requirements: (1) using

liquid fuel and (2) having a power below 1% of the maximum power registered in 2007.7”

Bolivia explains that this variation did not mean that companies owning such generation
units would stop charging for the electricity that they were contributing to the system, but
rather, that they would receive the monetary value of their variable unit costs, as per

Operating Rule No. 3/2008.

245.The Claimants also allege that the modification is contrary to their legitimate expectations.
However, this allegation does not transform a matter of Bolivian law into an international
matter, especially when the purported legitimate expectations stem from Bolivian regulations

263

on spot prices.” Ultimately, the Claimants seek to have the Tribunal determine whether

Bolivia has breached Bolivian law.

246.This New Claim is thus of a domestic nature, pertaining to Bolivian law. Consequently,
Bolivia considers that it has not breached its obligations under the Treaties (fair and
equitable treatment, full protection and security, and impairment of the investment through

the adoption of unreasonable measures).

Moreover, it adds that the Claimants purport to
have the Tribunal act as an administrative authority or last instance regulator of the
electricity sector, superseding Operating Rule No. 3/2008 and deciding on the correct
formula for the determination of the spot price, which powers exceed the scope of arbitration

tribunals’ jurisdiction, as stated by relevant case law.

247. Concerning the New Claim on the PBP, the Respondent alleges that Claimants intend that
the Tribunal rule on what the PBP should be, (i) the one set forth in Operating Rule No. 19
of 2001, adopted through Resolution SSDE No. 121/2001, or (ii) the one set forth in the new
Operating Rule No. 19 of February 2007, adopted through Resolution SSDE
No. 040/2007.7”

248. After outlining the most important provisions regarding the calculation of the PBP,”*

Bolivia holds that the modification made through Operating Rule No. 19/2007 was made as a

 

 

of the ind d hnical study di d by Bates White on the values that

form part of the PBP calculation. Such study concluded that there was no economic reason to

add to the FOB price of the turbine an additional 20% for “ancillary equipment” before
adding the 50% amount for additional costs.” This additional 20% was therefore

eliminated.”

249. Against such backdrop, the Claimants challenged the validity of Operating Rule No. 19/2007
both before both administrative authorities and courts.2”’ Now, in this arbitration, they
request access to effective means of asserting these claims, beyond those available in the
Bolivian court system. From the Respondent’s standpoint, the Claimants want the Tribunal
to decide whether there was a valid justification for the modification made to Operating Rule
No. 19/2001, superseding any future ruling on this matter by the Bolivian courts. Once more,
this is a domestic law conflict which falls beyond the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”
Even when the Claimants assert that they seek compensation for the “delay” in the ruling of
Bolivian courts, their expert’s quantification reveals that the Claimants seek damages
calculated on the basis of a hypothetical, retroactive annulment by the Bolivian judiciary of

the Operating Rules.””

250. Finally, concerning the New Claim regarding the Worthington engines, the Respondent
considers that the Claimants’ request seeks to have the Tribunal decide a matter which is
exclusively commercial in nature” between Energais and EGSA.”” Moreover, these New
Claims were not included in the Nationalisation Decree and, thus, no measure related to
them can be attributed to the Respondent. In fact, Bolivia considers that the Claimants have
not submitted sufficient evidence of any acts which could be tantamount to expropriation
under international law. In any event, the statements made by ENDE’s Manager (that the

Claimants use to support the existence of a claim under the Treaties) do not engage Bolivia’s

°° tn this regard, the Respondent mentions the case of Iberdrola v. Guatemala again, where the arbitration tribunal
considered that the investor was making claims, basing them on a treaty, concerning matters that were actually utterly
regulatory in relation to the tariffs applicable to the electricity sector. Thus, it considered that the claims were not protected
under the treaty.

that such merely commercial claims do not give rise to claims under the investment treaties.

international responsibility, since the latter is not a State officer empowered to carry out an

expropriation.””

251.Therefore, the New Claims do not relate to Treaty violations, but instead relate to the scope
of Bolivian domestic law. The Tribunal thus lacks jurisdiction over this matter. Otherwise, it
would be exercising powers that properly belong to Bolivian administrative and judicial

authorities.”””

The Claimants’ Arguments

252. According to the Claimants, the claims the Respondent characterizes as “New Claims” are
based on the Treaties and are not of a merely contractual or commercial nature, nor do they
pertain to Bolivian law, as the Respondent alleges.”* The Claimants hold that if the facts
presented could prima facie give rise to a violation of the Treaties, these would fall within
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Thus, for each of their three claims, the Claimants present a

situation in which prima facie Bolivia breached the Treaties.””

253. First, as regards the claim relating to the spot price, the Tribunal is not expected to determine
the price that should be applied to the generators, but rather to determine whether the
modification by Bolivia of the regulatory framework in relation to spot prices frustrated the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the
full protection and security standard, and the obligation not to impair investments by
arbitrary and unreasonable measures.””

254. Even if the Claimants’ legitimate expectations had been formed by reference to Bolivian
law, that does not transform them into purely domestic ones. Arbitral tribunals have
considered that frustration of legitimate expectations based on the legal framework of a State

gives rise to treaty violations.”*' The same happens with the calculation of damages resulting

from the spot price calculation, since this is a matter of fact, assessed in accordance with

principles of international law on compensation for breaches of international obligations.”

255.Second, the Claimants are not requesting the Tribunal to determine the PBP, but to
determine whether, following the Bolivian judicial system’s ineffectiveness and the four and
a half year delay to resolve EGSA’s claim, Claimants have not had access to effective means
to obtain compensation for their claims, all of which would lead to a breach of the Treaties.

Therefore, this is a question of international law.

In addition, given that the effective
means standard applies both to judicial as well as administrative claims, it is difficult for the
Claimants to understand Respondent’s argument. Likewise, quantification of damages in this

case is a question of international law.”

256. Ultimately, the Claimants consider that should the Tribunal accept that these questions may
imply a breach of the Treaties, the Tribunal would necessarily also have jurisdiction to
decide on the merits of the claims in accordance with the case law and legal authorities
cited.*° Bolivia’s argument should be rejected as the case law on which it relies is

inapplicable to these proceedings,”*° since the Claimants do not request that the Tribunal
render an opinion on Bolivian law, but rather that it decide whether Bolivia fulfilled its

obligations under the Treaties.

257. According to the Claimants, Bolivia has not challenged the existence of facts supporting
such claims. On the contrary, Bolivia submits arguments on the merits alleging that its
conduct does not amount to a breach of the Treaties, disguising such arguments as
jurisdictional objections. Finally, the Jberdrola v. Guatemala case invoked by Bolivia is not
applicable to this case, since the Claimants are not requesting the Tribunal to fix spot and
PBP prices, but to find that their modification gave rise to a breach of international

obligations.

whether the State had violated or not its obligations under the treaty was not in debate, therefore everything ended up in the
fact that it was a question relating to the law of Guatemala.

F. ALLEGED EXERCISE OF THE FORK-IN-THE-ROAD CLAUSE

The Respondent’s Arguments

258. According to the Respondent, in the event the Tribunal considers it has jurisdiction over the
New Claims, it must take into account the fact that the Claimants have previously resorted to
the court system to obtain a decision on the PBP. In accordance with Articles IX(2) and
IX(3)(a) of the US-Bolivia BIT, selection of one of the possible options for dispute
resolution by the Claimants (in this case, resort to the court system) precludes the possibility
of resorting to the other options (such as the arbitration) to seek a decision with respect to the
same claim. Likewise, the Respondent considers that the Claimants are “treaty shopping”
and “cherry picking” when they argue that this objection would only affect GAI, since
Rurelec cannot invoke the effective means standard in the US-Bolivia BIT while ignoring
the fork-in-the-road clause in the latter. In the Respondent’s view, the above demonstrates
the abusive nature of the joinder of treaties and claimants in this arbitration without the
State’s consent, which the Tribunal should thus reject. 287

259. According to the Respondent, Article IX(3)(a) is a “fork-in-the-road” clause. Thus, once the
investor chooses one of the possible options, this choice is irrevocable and exclusive of the
other options. According to the authorities cited, the purpose of this kind of clause is to
prevent investors from simultaneously submitting the same dispute to multiple different fora

at the same time (as in the case at hand) in an attempt to increase their chances of success.”**

260. In any event, the Respondent holds that it is for the Tribunal to decide whether the claim
relating to the PBP that Claimants have submitted is like the one previously submitted before
the Bolivian courts. By means of a table contrasting the Claimants’ allegations and

arguments before the Supreme Court with those submitted before this Tribunal,”

Bolivia
explains how in both fora the Claimants submit the same claim for compensation for the
alleged losses incurred (as well as for the revenue forgone) as a result of the modifications
introduced with respect to the PBP. 2 Therefore, should the Tribunal be seized of this New
Claim, it would be “prejudging” the subsequent decision to be rendered by the Bolivian

Supreme Court, as if it had “supervisory jurisdiction” or was an “appellate instance” of the

Bolivian judicial system. The foregoing considerations reinforce the Respondent’s

arguments as to the domestic nature of this claim.

261.In response to the Claimants’ argument that claims must satisfy the triple identity test

(identity of parties, cause of action, and subject matter) to be considered as the same dispute

under the articles cited above (which is not met in this case according to the Claimants),
the Respondent asserts that this test is criticised by case law and legal scholars as excessively
formalistic and liable to leave the fork-in-the-road clause without any purpose.””* According
to the Respondent, the excessive formalism of the triple identity test is shown by its third
requirement, since the Claimants’ position’ would render it impossible for claims to ever
have the same cause of action giving rise to the application of the fork-in-the-road clause.
Therefore, the Tribunal must reject this argument and decline its jurisdiction with respect to

this New Claim.

262.Lastly, a proper analysis of the “identity of the parties” requires consideration of the
companies’ corporate reality instead of a nominal test. The Claimants assert that it was not

the same legal entity which submitted both claims, which, according to the Respondent,

295

would make this requirement impossible to meet.” Moreover, in accordance with the case

law provided, it is possible to examine the “group of companies” in order to determine

whether an “identity of parties” exists.”°

Finally, the Claimants’ assertion according to
which Bolivia’s objection would deprive the effective means provision clause of its effet

utile by preventing the investor from pursuing domestic remedies is incorrect. According to

2 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 94-95. The Respondent, in its Reply on Jurisdiction, 207, copies textually from the
Counter-Memorial the arguments presented thereby: “the fork in the road clause applies only when an investment treaty
arbitration and a domestic court litigation have [...] (iii) the same legal basis for the claim {...] although [EGSA] relied on
Bolivian Law, GAL is suing for breach of the effective means provision (Article I1.4) of the US Treaty.”

 

 

5 Reply on Jurisdiction, (211. The Respondent considers that GAI, not having been incorporated in Bolivia or performing
energy activities at its own risk, lacks standing to commence administrative proceedings. Likewise, the company is
controlled, mostly, by Bolivian investors. At the time of submitting a request for arbitration, EGSA could not be regarded as
an investor from the United States.

the Respondent, that argument overlooks the existence of the requirement of an “identity of

dispute” as a pre-condition for application of the fork-in-the-road clause.”

263. Therefore, the Respondent concludes the Tribunal must reject the claim relating to the PBP,
since in accordance with Article [X(2) of the US-Bolivia BIT, it is one same claim submitted

before two different fora.

The Claimants’ Arguments

264. The Claimants assert that the above objection should be rejected. For the fork-in-the-road
clause to be invoked it is necessary that the dispute be the same and, therefore, the triple
identity test be met as to parties, subject matter, and cause of action.”* The Claimants
consider that (i) there is no identity of parties, since the domestic proceedings were pursued
by EGSA and Bolivia was not a party thereto; (ii) in the arbitration at issue, GAI claims
compensation for economic harm, whereas in the domestic proceedings a number of
administrative resolutions are sought to be revoked; and, (iii) the cause of action is different.
Although EGSA based its remedy on Bolivian law, GAI commenced this arbitration alleging

a violation of the effective means standard under the US-Bolivia BIT.

265. In short, GAI needs to prove the ineffectiveness of the means available in the Bolivian court
system. In the Pantechniki case cited by the Respondent,” the arbitrator compared the legal
basis of the claims and applied the triple identity test to determine whether the fork-in-the-
road clause should operate or not, concluding that the test was actually met, since the parties,
the subject matter and the cause of action were the same. Nevertheless, the arbitrator found
that the claimant’s claim relating to denial of justice should be heard, since this claim had not
been addressed in the domestic sphere. Therefore, the Claimants consider that the Tribunal
should afford the same treatment to its claim on effective means (i.e., consider that it could

not have been submitted to the domestic courts). Should the arguments stated by Bolivia in

7 Reply on Jurisdiction, 4213. The Respondent holds that the Claimants’ assertion would make it impossible for the fork-in-
the-road and the effective means clauses to coexist. Nevertheless, this is not true, since an American investor, in accordance
with the US-Bolivia BIT, can submit a claim before the domestic courts, when being affected by ineffective means, and
submit a claim under the BIT itself that is not affected by the fork-in-the-road clause. This would actually occur when there is
no dispute unity.

that respect be accepted,”

Article II(4) and other BIT provisions would be rendered
meaningless, since any lack of effective means or denial of justice claims in respect of the
conduct of the Bolivian courts would be automatically excluded by the mere fact of having

resorted to such courts in the first place.

266.In response to the Respondent’s arguments as to the application of the fork-in-the-road
clause to the claim under the UK-Bolivia BIT,” the Claimants assert that it is possible to
bring in another treaty’s substantive standard through the MFN clause without needing to
comply with the provisions on dispute resolution of that other treaty. In any event, such
clause can only be triggered if the triple identity test is met, which is not the case in the

present arbitration. Contrary to Respondent’s assertions,”

there is no identity of parties,
since the judicial actions were brought by EGSA and not by GAI or Rurelec. Additionally,
the wording of the US-Bolivia BIT refers to a single company (not to a group of companies),

and GAI did not take part in the Bolivian proceedings. **

267. According to the Claimants, it is not the same dispute either. Nor do the parties pursue the
same relief in both proceedings. The existence of an interest in a dispute does not determine
the nature thereof. EGSA requested that the Bolivian Supreme Court revoke the
administrative regulations that introduced a regulatory change under Bolivian law, whereas
GAI requested that the Tribunal award compensation for Bolivia’s violation of the US-
Bolivia BIT arising from the Supreme Court’s inaction. Thus, both the subject matter and
cause of action in each proceeding is different.

268. Lastly, the Claimants explain that the coexistence of a domestic proceeding and the present
arbitration would not result in double recovery, as Bolivia suggests.“ Should the Supreme
Court find for EGSA, such decision would only benefit the currently nationalised EGSA and
not the Claimants. Finally, the Claimants do not accept that the triple identity test renders the
fork-in-the-road clause meaningless, since the goal is to prevent the same investor from

submitting the same dispute before both the domestic courts as well as an arbitral tribunal.*°°

G. ALLEGED PREMATURE NATURE OF THE CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SPOT
PRICE AND WORTHINGTON ENGINES

The Respondent’s Arguments

269. In the Respondent’s view, should the Tribunal decide to hear the New Claims relating to the
spot price and the Worthington engines, these should be declared inadmissible by virtue of
being prematurely presented, since Bolivia has had no chance to review its conduct and
potentially correct it. In similar situations, arbitral case law has considered that claims are

3
premature*”

when the investor has not undertaken reasonable efforts to achieve the
revocation of the act the investor deems illegal before domestic instances, and distinguished
this principle from the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies referred to by the
Claimants.“ The host State of the investment cannot be held liable for an international

wrongful act, absent the opportunity to remedy its conduct.

270. The Respondent submits, on the basis of the explanation provided by Dr Carlos Quispe, that
the Claimants have failed to exhaust the different administrative and judicial channels to

challenge the decisions relating to the spot price modification.”

27

.In its Reply, the Respondent holds that the Claimants made “no effort whatsoever” to oppose
the measure relating to spot prices, and that reasonable efforts to obtain the restitution of the
engines were lacking.*'’ Additionally, the Respondent considers that the Claimants confuse
this objection with the exhaustion of local remedies requirement. In any event, the premature
nature of the claims is not a procedural requirement, but an element affecting the substance
of international wrongful act. *"!

272. In turn, the Claimants have not denied not having made use of the administrative and judicial

remedies available to challenge the measures relating to the spot price and the Worthington

engines. In Bolivia’s view, this opportunity goes to the substance of the claims and must not

be mistaken with the rule of exhaustion of local remedies.*!”

273.In addition, the Respondent considers that the Claimants’ interpretation of the Jan de Nul
and Loewen cases is erroneous.*" First, the Loewen Tribunal,*"* in spite of hearing a denial
of justice claim, set forth the rule that “the State should be afforded the opportunity of
redressing, through its legal system, the inchoate breach of international law”. Such rule,
according to the Respondent, should not only be applied to denial of justice cases, but also to
national treatment, minimum standard of treatment and expropriation claims. Secondly, the
Jan de Nul Tribunal,*'® making no distinction whatsoever regarding the disputed measure,
determined that there is a “clear trend of cases requiring an attempt to seek redress in
domestic courts before bringing a claim for violation of BIT standards, irrespective of any

obligation to exhaust local remedies.”

274. Lastly, the Respondent deems the Claimants’ criticisms of the Generation Ukraine case off
the mark when they cite to the Helnan annulment,*"* since although the Helnan committee”
asserted that the tribunal’s decision’'* stands “somewhat outside the jurisprudence

constante”, it also explained that “on its facts, the decision of the Generation Ukraine

tribunal is understandable”

275. In Bolivia’s view, it cannot be ignored that both in the Generation Ukraine case as well as in

this arbitration, the alleged wrongful acts were decisions of first instance authorities. The

Tribunal should take this into account, as the Helnan committee and tribunal did when

wae . A 3
considering the Generation Ukraine case.”

The Claimants’ Arguments

276. According to the Claimants, the claims are neither premature nor inadmissible. In any event,
the Treaties do not require that a dispute be heard by domestic or administrative courts
before a party may resort to an arbitration tribunal. In addition, the exhaustion of local
remedies is unnecessary in the investment treaty context, except in connection with denial of
justice claims.*' This view is consistently upheld by the case law submitted by the
Claimants, unlike that cited by Bolivia, which is inapplicable to this case, as it refers to (i)
denial of justice claims (which do require exhaustion of local remedies), and (ii) the

Generation Ukraine case, which was later criticized by the Helnan tribunal.**

277. In their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimants also state that the argument put forward by
Bolivia stands in contradiction to their previous jurisdictional objection concerning the fork-
in-the-road clause. The Respondent now asserts that claims concerning the spot price and the
Worthington engines were required to have been previously submitted to Bolivian courts.“
In other words, such claims would be premature, due to the Claimants failure to invoke or

exhaust the local remedies available to them in accordance with the case law submitted by

325

the Respondent.”” Nonetheless, the Respondent has omitted relevant parts of those cases in

which domestic remedies were not required to be exhausted.*” Therefore, the objection is

groundless and should be dismissed.

CHAPTER VI - THE PARTIES’ RELIEF SOUGHT ON JURISDICTION

A. THE RESPONDENT’S RELIEF SOUGHT

278. Bolivia requests that the Tribunal declare that:

(a) in accordance with the US-Bolivia BIT and the UK-Bolivia BIT, Bolivia did not
consent to the submission of claims filed jointly by the Claimants under both Treaties in
a single international arbitration proceeding, and that the Tribunal therefore lacks

jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Claimants;

(b) alternatively, it has no rationae personae jurisdiction over the claims filed by Rurelec
under the UK-Bolivia BIT;

(c) it has no jurisdiction over GAI, as Bolivia has denied it the benefits of the US-Bolivia
BIT;

(d) alternatively, it has no jurisdiction over the New Claims, since they fail to meet the
conditions set forth in the Treaties;

(e) alternatively, it has no rationae materiae jurisdiction over the New Claims, due to the

fact that they fall within the ambit of Bolivian law and are not admissible under the

Treaties;

(f) alternatively, it has no jurisdiction over the PBP claim pursuant to the fork-in-the-road

clause contained in the US-Bolivia BIT; and

(g) alternatively, the Claimants’ claims concerning the spot price are premature and

inadmissible.
279. Bolivia requests that the Tribunal order:

(a) that the Claimants grant a bank guarantee to cover the relevant costs of the

a. a7
arbitration;

(b) that the Claimants reimburse the State in full for the costs incurred in order to defend its

interests in the context of this arbitration, plus interest accrued at a commercial rate

deemed reasonable by the Tribunal, from the date on which the State incurred such

costs until the date of actual payment thereof; and

(c) Any other remedy to the State which the Tribunal deems fit.**

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ RELIEF SOUGHT
280. The Claimants request that the Tribunal:
(a) declare that it has jurisdiction to decide this dispute in its entirety;

(b) award the Claimants attorneys’ fees and costs for this phase of the arbitration, plus

interest;

(c) award such other relief as the Tribunal may consider appropriate.*”

CHAPTER VII - ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES ON THE MERITS
A. CLAIM FOR EGSA’S ALLEGED UNLAWFUL EXPROPIATION
1. The Claimants’ Arguments
(i) Bolivia Made an Unlawful Expropriation

281.The Claimants argue that, pursuant to Article III of the US-Bolivia BIT and Article 5(1) of
the UK-Bolivia BIT, for an expropriation to be lawful, a series of conditions must be met,
namely:*”

(a) Promptness of Compensation. The Claimants assert that this is a principle
internationally recognized by various international tribunals. Therefore, based on
various scholarly pieces, they consider that payment of the compensation must be
contemporaneous with the expropriation, and must be made as soon as practicable

without undue delay.**"

o

Adequacy and/or Fairness of Compensation. The Claimants consider that compensation
must be equivalent to the aggregate value of the expropriated asset, which is equivalent
to the fair market value (hereinafter, “FMV”) of the expropriated investment.**
Therefore, based on ample case law, Claimants consider that a nationalisation is always
unlawful if the compensation offered by the government is below the FMV of the

: 333,
investment.

Due Proce:

(c

The Claimants argue, based on ample case law, that due process requires

 

that a nationalisation be carried out in a manner that allows the investor to exercise its

rights, in particular with respect to the calculation of proper compensation. The
Claimants consider that the requirement of due process should apply to the
expropriation process as a whole, including the calculation of compensation. Therefore,
they believe that a violation arises whenever the government exercises its powers to

deny proper compensation or to unduly delay the process.***

282.The Claimants assert that, in spite of the above, Bolivia offered them no compensation
following the nationalisation. To the contrary, the Claimants argue that Bolivia took a series
of “fundamentally unfair measures to ensure that the Claimants would receive no

335

compensation for their assets. The Claimants assert a lack of due process for the

following reasons:

(a) The Nationalisation Decree provided for a non-transparent valuation process,
unilaterally performed by the Government, without the Claimants’ participation. The
result of the valuation, in the Claimants’ view, was clearly predetermined given that

EGSA was in a good financial situation at the moment of the nationalisation;

o

The Claimants were merely informed that some companies had been requested to

perform the analysis, without any further explanation;

(c

The audits ordered by the Government a posteriori reflect the use of unconventional

accounting criteria with the sole purpose of reducing EGSA’s apparent value;

@

The Respondent did not submit to the Claimants any report on the valuation process

performed, or a formal conclusion on the amount of the compensation;

336

(e

Finally, no compensation whatsoever was offered.

(ii) Claimants are Entitled to Compensation for the Nationalisation

283.The Claimants affirm that the Respondent committed an internationally wrongful act and,

therefore, must redress the damage caused to the Claimants’ investment in Bolivia. The

Claimants argue that they are entitled to receive adequate compensation so as to restore them
to the situation, in economic terms, as it was before the expropriation, as described in the two
Compass Lexecon Valuation Reports prepared by Dr Abdala (hereinafter, the “Compass

Lexecon’).

284. The Claimants affirm that both Treaties embody a special legal regime on compensation in
case of expropriation, which follow the main elements of customary international law and
the “Hull Formula” of prompt, adequate and effective compensation for expropriation that
reflects the FMV of the expropriated asset. Therefore, given that no compensation has been
paid and the expropriation was unlawful, the applicable standard is now that under
customary international law, which imposes a broader compensation standard, including full
compensation and lost profits, to the extent they are verified in accordance with the case
law.*”” Moreover, a standard of proof to be applied to all claimed damages is that of “balance
of probabilities”. Thus, a respondent State cannot “invoke the burden of the proof as to the
amount of compensation for such loss to the extent that it would compound the respondent’s
wrongs and unfairly defeat the claimant’s claim for compensation.”***

285. In addition, the Claimants consider that compensation must be assessed using the FMV as of
the date of the deprivation of rights (1 May 2010), taking into account future profitability
given that it was a company with income generating assets (a “going concern”) and,
ultimately, this is the formula used by market players to calculate the value of companies.*”
The Claimants further consider that the most appropriate method to calculate FMV is by

using the Discounted Cash Flow method (hereinafter, “DCF”), pursuant to international law

and case law. Claimants note that they have used the Weighted Average Cost of Capital

(hereinafter, “WACC”) as the discount rate.“

286. The Claimants clarify that Compass Lexecon, in determining this FMV, omitted the losses
sustained upon modification of the regulatory framework as regards spot prices and PBP.
According to the Claimants, this means that its estimate of EGSA’s FMV as of 1 May 2010
does not reflect the losses caused to the Claimants by the aforementioned measures.
Consequently, the losses sustained in connection with those measures are calculated
separately.™! In that vein, a DCF model was created for EGSA as of May 2010, based on the
assumption that the measures before nationalisation would remain effective until the

completion of the valuation period.“”

287. Below, the Claimants list and explain the key assumptions made by Compass Lexecon in

calculating the compensation owed:*?

(a) Timeframe: The DCF projection is based on the fact that EGSA’s Generation Licenses
are effective until 2038. Thus, cash flows are projected (on an annual basis) from May

2010 through December 2038.**

(b) Revenue Forecasts:

 

(i) Revenues for Sale of Electricity: Using the information available to a potential
buyer on the day of the nationalisation, with support of the independent firm
specialized in engineering, Mercados Energéticos Consultores (hereinafter,
“MEC”), Compass Lexecon developed a simulation of the amount of electricity
dispatched by EGSA and the electricity spot prices based on the evolution of the
supply and demand of electric energy in Bolivia over time. Thus, using the same
software used by CNDC, known as Stochastic Dual Dynamic Programming
(hereinafter, “SDDP”), two different periods are projected: one between May 2010
and December 2018 (using the dispatch simulation created by MEC), and a second
period from 2019 through 2038, using the spot prices projected by MEC for 2018

and, from that date, remaining constant in real terms and adjusting in nominal

terms by the U.S. Producer Price Index (hereinafter, “pPr”).*°

(ii) Revenues for capacity: Compass Lexecon utilized MEC’s electricity dispatch
calculations and corroborated that all of EGSA’s units could have continued to
receive PBP payments given the great increase foreseen in the electricity demand.
With respect to the evolution of the PBP, Compass Lexecon adjusted it annually by
the “Turbine US PPI” (a special index which is more appropriate than the general

one). M6

(iii) Revenues for Sale of Carbon Credits: The Claimants incorporate in EGSA’s

 

forecasted revenues those revenues resulting from the sale of EGSA’s certificates

of reduction of greenhouse gas emission through the installation of the CCGT.

(c) Operating Expenses (hereinafter, “OPEX”): Energy costs are, according to the
Claimants, the main variable costs that must be taken into account. Thus, Compass
Lexecon uses the maximum regulated price of natural gas as of May 2010, considering

that it remains constant in real terms, and adjusted by the PPI.

(d) Capital Expenditures (hereinafter, “CAPEX”): The Claimants include the expenses
foreseen to complete the CCGT, based on EGSA’s financial statements for 2009.

(e) Net Cash Flows: Compass Lexecon uses the aforementioned variables to calculate

EGSA’s free cash flows between 2010 and 2018.

(f) WACC (Discount Rate): As explained by Claimants, the estimated WACC is designed
to reflect all the risks a WB would have taken into account when acquiring the
Claimants’ equity interest in EGSA. In addition, the Claimants consider that even if the
WACC might not provide for all the assets’ risks where there is a likely cash flow
shortage, there was no risk of bankruptcy for EGSA in this case. The average used by
Compass Lexecon is 10.63%, which is produced by assessing EGSA’s debt and equity

and the relative weight between them.” This average is consistent with investment law

practice as tribunals typically apply the WACC without adjusting it upwards on account

of the existence of “hidden” risks.“*

There are particular differences of opinion on this topic among the Parties’ experts,
which, in the Claimants’ view, cause Econ One’s Valuation Reports prepared by Mr.
Flores (hereinafter, “Econ One”) to apply an incorrect discount rate of around 20%: (a)
it introduces a “size premium” of 6.28% on the value of EGSA shares, despite such
amount being unreasonable in the valuation of generation companies in Latin American
countries. EGSA’s market share and its low risk lead the Claimants to deem the “size
premium” advocated for by Econ One to be inappropriate;“” (b) Econ One multiplies
the country risk premium, which reflects the ratio between price volatility of Bolivian
stock and bonds, by 1.5, leading to a country risk premium of 10.53%,. The use of this
multiplier deviates from the recommendations of Professor Damodaran (who Econ One

relies upon) and is practically unheard of in investment treaty cases.

(g) Interest: The Claimants submit that interest constitutes a component of full reparation of

the damage caused by the unlawful expropriation, and therefore is not to be considered
a penalty separate from reparation.**' The Claimants assert that the determination of the
applicable type of interest must be based in the Claimants’ opportunity cost of the losses
suffered and argue that the proper measure for such lost opportunity is EGSA’s WACC,
this is, 10.63%, rather than a risk-free rate. This rate of interest must be applied from the
date of the expropriation to the date of the award, as well as from that date until that of

the full payment by Bolivia of the compensation determined in the award.**

(h) Taxes: As regards taxes, the Claimants request that the Tribunal declare that: (i) the
award establishes a net amount, free of any Bolivian taxes; (ii) the Respondent may not
levy or attempt to levy its taxes on the amount of the award. Otherwise, the Claimants
would be taxed twice on the same income. Moreover, the Claimants request
compensation from Bolivia for any adverse effect resulting from the imposition of taxes
by UK or US authorities, in the event that the declaration considered in the Tribunal’s

award is not accepted as evidence equivalent to payment.***

288. In their Statement of Claim, the Claimants determined the FMV of its participation in EGSA
as of | May 2010 at USD 80.9 million, which amount they reduced to USD 77.5 million in
their Reply on the Merits. In said Reply, the Claimants added to this amount USD 15.8
million in interest from the date of nationalisation to 29 February 2012, date of the filing of
the Claim, resulting in a compensation of USD 93.3 million for damages and losses from the

eg
nationalisation.”

289. In sum, for the Claimants, unless the Tribunal considers that a potential buyer would have
paid nothing for EGSA prior to the nationalisation, the expropriation made by Bolivia should
be considered unlawful and in violation of the Treaties, given that it did not respect due

«355
process and offered no compensation.

2. The Respondent’s Arguments
(i) Bolivia Did Not Effect an Unlawful Expropriation

290. The Respondent states that the alleged illegality of the nationalisation is merely a matter of
quantum.**° With an equity interest of zero dollars held by the Claimants in EGSA as of the
nationalisation date, Bolivia has no duty to compensate given that the Treaties do not provide
for payment of compensation in the event of nationalisation of assets with no value.*” The
Respondent has never denied (nor denies) that compensation should be paid following
nationalisation, but only in an amount equivalent to the FMV of the investment and nothing

3
more.**

291.As regards the requirements considered by the Claimants, the Respondent submits as

follows:

(a) With respect to the “promptness”, the Respondent asserts having met such condition, as
the valuation process of the equity interest was conducted within the 120 business days
specified under the Nationalisation Decree. Moreover, Bolivia took the necessary
measures to compute the FMV without any delay, while informing the Claimants of the

. a 359
negative value of their investment.

(b) Determining what amounts to “fair” and “adequate” compensation under the Treaties
depends on the economic and financial calculation of the FMV of the investment, that
is, what PROFIN did—according to the Respondent—pursuant to the Nationalisation
Decree and what the Econ One later did in this arbitration as well. Therefore, upon
calculation of such amount, payment must be made without delay. However, if the
FMV is negative, the State has no obligation to pay such compensation, and the

nationalisation is not thereby rendered unlawful.*”

(c) Bolivia did comply with due process given that: (i) the condition of due process refers
to the expropriation measure but not to the subsequent investment valuation process;**'
(ii) the Claimants themselves failed to allege that the Nationalisation Decree had

. 3
violated due process; 2

(iii) there is no provision in the Treaties requiring the
Claimants’ participation in the valuation process in order for the expropriation to be
lawful, and thus Bolivia is would be held liable for an obligation that does not exist;
and (iv) the Claimants fail to specify which provisions of the Treaties have been

allegedly violated.**

In any event, (i) the call for consulting services was published by ENDE in June 2010,
clearly defining the process to be followed; (ii) there were clear rules on how to perform
the valuation pursuant to such call; (iii) indeed, said rules were consistent with the
methodology specified by the Treaties and followed by both valuation experts, that is,
by the DCF method; (iv) Claimants were informed of the publication of the call, and the
hiring of PROFIN was also published in the media; and (v) the Respondent did inform
the Claimants that EGSA’s FMV was negative, and thus there was no obligation to

3
compensate.***

In addition, the result of the calculation of EGSA’s value was clearly not pre-
determined. To the contrary, PROFIN also calculated the FMV for the shares of Corani
and Valle Hermoso, which did have a positive value and for which Bolivia paid the
relevant compensation.*° If the Claimants did not have PROFIN’s report, it was
because they never requested it from Bolivia, possibly with a view to alleging the
non-existence of a “proper valuation process”. In any case, for the avoidance of doubt,
Bolivia distributed PROFIN’s report during this arbitral proceeding.*” The new audit
performed in March 2011 of EGSA’s accounting statements has no relevance in

determining the FMV, as the respective experts have not based their calculations on the

theoretical accounting value of EGSA. The Claimants also fail to explain how such
audit could have reduced a valuation already performed by PROFIN. Instead, it was

justified by technical reasons, as stated by Lic. Bejarano.**
(ii) The Claimants are not Entitled to Receive any Compensation

292.The Respondent agrees that the FMV must be calculated after the nationalisation, and the
valuation date used by the parties is 1 May 2010. Similarly, the Parties agree that the FMV
can be calculated applying the DCF and that, as of the valuation date, EGSA had a financial
debt of USD 92.7 million and a considerable amount of bills to be paid. The Respondent
describes EGSA’s situation as an economic crisis*” and disagrees with the Claimants on the
following three key issues.*””

293.First, the standard applicable to the compensation: The Respondent affirms that, as a
precondition to obtain compensation, the Claimants must prove beyond a doubt that they
suffered damage resulting from the expropriation. The Respondent denies that there is any
practical difference between the full reparation standard under customary international law
and the standard under the Treaties. Also, the Respondent does not believe that the standard
of “balance of probabilities” is appropriate, as it applies only to damages that cannot be
established with absolute certainty, that is, future damages. The nationalisation is lawful
under both Bolivian and international law, since the failure to pay compensation for assets
with no value does not amount to an international wrong.*”' Finally, the Respondent explains
that the Claimants have used two alternative methods to calculate the FMV—book value and
market multiple benchmarks/comparables—whose application cannot be justified in this
case.”

294. Secondly, EGSA’s cash flow forecast: The Respondent underscores that Compass Lexecon

made a fundamental mistake, since instead of using the latest available information as of the

nationalisation date, it used information that was not available as of 1 May 2010. The
Respondent describes how it calculated the FMV to conclude that such value is nil, so the
Respondent was under no obligation to pay any compensation. Econ One shows that, even
though both parties have used the same method (DCF) and the same valuation date, they
both started from different premises and therefore obtained different results.*”* Based on
Econ One’s report, Respondent lists the most serious mistakes made by Compass Lexecon as

follows:*”>

(a) EGSA’s Revenue Forecast. Econ One considers that the calculation made by Compass
Lexecon in relation to the three main sources of income—the sale of energy at the spot
market, the PBP, and the carbon credits resulting from the combined cycle project—is

3
erroneous.*”*

(i) Sale of energy in the spot market. Compass Lexecon’s calculation is erroneous
because it has used information that was not available at the valuation date, has
inflated the spot price by applying an excessive inflation factor, and has not

allowed for price stabilization.

Econ One looks at two fundamental mistakes.*”’ The first relates to the supply and
demand projections, for which Compass Lexecon has used the studies conducted
by MEC and later by Estudios de Infraestructura (hereinafter, “EdI”), and
information that was either outdated or unavailable at the valuation date. By way of

example, Bolivia cites the following mistakes:

a. MEC and EdI rely upon CNDC’s study on mid-term programming
(hereinafter, “MTP”), published in 2009, despite the existence of a study on
the same topic of March 2010;

b. MEC and EdI use a study published in July 2011, that is, more than one year
after the nationalisation date, to forecast the electric energy demand since

2011; and

c. MEC and Edl use the Plan Optimo de Expansién del Sistema Interconectado
2011-2012 (hereinafter, “POES”), published in December 2010 (that is, after
the nationalisation), despite the availability of the 2010-2011 POES, published

in November 2009, to project the electric energy generation supply.**

The second mistake is the calculation of natural gas and diesel prices. Claimants
assumed that such prices would rise based on the general inflation rate since 2010.
Accordingly, they applied an inflation factor to the energy price, which is incorrect,
because Bolivia has specific r on the regulation of gas and diesel prices.” In any
case, they would not rise since they have remained unchanged for nine and five
years, respectively. Therefore, it would be most reasonable to assume that they
would remain unaltered until 2018 and that they would start to rise from then
onwards. Moreover, Compass Lexecon has not allowed for stabilization of the
electricity tariff in force in Bolivia since 2003, and consequently the price forecast

has not been adjusted to the potential effect of stabilization.*”

(ii) Calculation of PBP. Econ One considers that it is erroneous for the following

reasons:

The Claimants do not use an actual forecast of power generation supply, unlike
Econ One,™" as they include units that would not receive any remuneration in the
future as EGSA’s available capacity. This mistake is caused by using incorrect data
provided by MEC and EdI, which have not performed any projection of power

generation supply to calculate EGSA’s available capacity. They only consider that

the generation units existing in 2010 would be fully available in the future, without

taking into account any other ongoing projects of new power generation.***

The Claimants inflate the future PBP by applying an extremely high inflation rate
based on the annual compound growth rate of the U.S. PPI-Turbines and Power
Generation Tools, from 2000 to 2010. That period was characterized by an increase
in the price of turbines higher that the general cost inflation. Consequently, Econ
One considers that it is preferable to index income by PBP based on the general

(iii) Carbon Credits Revenues Forecast. In its first report, Compass Lexecon failed to
take into account that EGSA was required to share part of those revenues with the

State. This mistake was corrected in its second report.**

(b) EGSA’s Future Operating Costs. In its first report, Compass Lexecon did not correctly
calculate the payment of Corporate Income Tax. This mistake had to be rectified in its

3
second report. **

(c) Depreciation Expenses. Compass Lexecon has erroneously applied hourly rates of
depreciation for the combined cycle project (which was expected to start operating in
November 2010), including the first ten months of the year, which causes the FMV to
be higher as of 1 May 2010.

EGSA through until 2038. Therefore, the result obtained is higher than its real FMV. In
addition to the above, the age of EGSA’s power generation infrastructure should be
taken into account, given that in May 2010, six out of the 21 units had been in operation
for more than 28 and 30 years. So, it is unrealistic to expect that such old units would
operate normally for another 28 years (until 2038). Consequently, Compass Lexecon
should have included an estimated sum of USD 2.5 million per unit as necessary work
to extend the service life of each of those units, which would amount to a total of

USD 17.5 million.**

295. Third, the discount rate. Compass Lexecon calculates WACC at 10.63% as at the valuation
date, and uses this value as the discount rate. In Respondent’s opinion, this rate is

insufficient, and any economist, or legal valuation expert would see that.*”

296.Econ One concludes that the rate that should be used is 19.85%,*” inter alia, on the
following grounds: (a) it is similar to the rate used by Claimants and EGSA when they
presented the combined cycle project before the United Nations to obtain funding;*' (b) the
rate calculated by Econ One is consistent with the rate used by other companies in Bolivia,
including the one managed by Mr Earl for power generation projects;*” (c) Econ One’s
discount rate has been calculated in accordance with internationally accepted methodology,

and the Claimants’ criticism of the inclusion of the multiplier of sovereign risk premium and

the size premium is unfounded;** and (d) contrary to the Claimants’ allegations** Econ

One’s discount rate is reasonable according to arbitral case law and the recommendations of

297. Lastly, the interest rate: The Respondent considers that the use of WACC as the interest rate
applied to the amount of compensation owed for the expropriation is not in conformity with
the standard provided for in the Treaties.*° First, WACC is not a “commercial interest rate”,
which is the criterion followed by the Treaties to determine the type of interest. Moreover, it
incorporates various risk premiums that compensate the risk inherent in the future cash flows
of EGSA, until 2038, which discount determines its market value. To the extent that the
expropriation of the Claimants’ participation in EGSA eliminated such risks, they should not
now be compensated for risks that they have no longer faced since May 2010. The
Respondent considers that a commercial interest rate should be, at the most, equal to LIBOR.
+ 2%, and that the Tribunal should apply a simple interest rate, rather than a compound rate,
pursuant to the case law it cites and in conformity with Bolivian law.*” The fact that there
are arbitral precedents that support the application of compound rates does not mean that this
must necessarily be applied. A compound interest rate need not be applied if it is found to be

inappropriate under the circumstances, as in the instant case.**

298. According to the above, the Respondent considers that, once the mistakes made by Compass
Lexecon in its report are corrected, the FMV of the shareholding claimed by the Claimants in

this arbitration is nil.” Therefore, Bolivia is not obligated to compensate the Claimants.

B. CLAIM FOR BREACH OF THE STANDARDS PROVIDED FOR IN THE TREATIES

299. The Claimants consider that the two following measures prior to 1 May 2010 have led to the
reduction of their investment: (i) the amendment to the regulatory framework in terms of the
spot price; and (ii) the amendment concerning the PBP. Both measures have breached the

Treaties and, thus, compensation should be paid.“

1. Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard

The Claimants’ Arguments

300. According to the Claimants, the fair and equitable treatment standard is recognized as a

401

flexible concept, affording protection when State action is considered unfair.” The investor

is entitled to demand justice in its relations with the host State. Furthermore, according to the
case law invoked by the Claimants, both bad faith and malicious intent are not required for a
breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard to arise, which coincides with the goals of
the Treaties: to promote and protect the investments, the Tribunal being responsible for

having regard to all relevant circumstances.”

301. Thus, the Claimants hold that such standard requires that investors be accorded a stable and

foreseeable investment environment, in accordance with the case law the Claimants

403

invoke.“ In this regard, the tribunal in CME v. Czech Republic™ found that regulatory and

legislative amendments adopted by the respondent had wrongfully damaged CME’s

405

investment; the tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina’” as well as the tribunal in Siemens v.

Argentina affirmed that a chief element of the breach of the fair and equitable treatment

standard is the frustration of the legitimate expectations held by the investor at the time the

investment is made. This standard is breached when fundamental conditions relied upon by

investors at the time of making an investment are altered.”

302. The Claimants invested in Bolivia in reliance upon a series of fundamental principles that
were paramount to the economic feasibility of the investment, and which were enshrined in
the regulatory framework governing spot prices at that time. Nonetheless, these fundamental
principles were modified in 2008, undermining the stability and foreseeability of the legal
framework, and thus frustrating the legitimate expectations of the Claimants. The Claimants
explain that, before 2008, all thermal units could be selected as marginal units. However,
Resolution SSDE No. 283 excluded liquid fuel units as potential marginal units. This change
meant that spot prices were artificially reduced when these turbines were dispatched, and the

most efficient companies (such as EGSA) lost a considerable part of their profit margin.“

303. Moreover, although the existence of a stabilization commitment is not necessary a
precondition for finding a breach of this standard, the Claimants allege that Article 5 of the
Dignity Tariff Agreement is a clear indication of the commitment by Bolivia not to alter the
spot price regime without first consulting stakeholders and ensuring sustainable income
levels. In any case, investors are entitled to fair and equitable treatment throughout the life of
the investment in this case, from the year 2006 onwards. Hence, the Claimants could in fact
have a legitimate expectation based on such provision. Furthermore, Claimants did not show
acceptance when signing the 2010 Dignity Tariff agreement; on the contrary, EGSA refused
to execute the agreement despite the threats made by Government officials. Finally, EGSA

gave in and executed the agreement in an attempt to avoid being nationalised. “”

304.In addition, it is irrelevant whether the regulatory modification of the spot price was
reasonable and justified. When a protected investor has based its actions on a regulatory
framework, the alteration of the rules need not be arbitrary or unreasonable in order to be
unfair.“"° In any event, Compass Lexecon has demonstrated that the decision to exclude
liquid fuel units from the calculation of the spot price does not create a more efficient

market, but rather the opposite. In addition, the Claimants consider that regulatory

amendments that reduced the value of a company that the Government was seeking to

acquire was convenient for the latter, but barely “rational” from a political perspective.*"!

The Respondent’s Arguments

305. According to Bolivia, the Claimants interpret this

 

standard too broadly. The object of the
protection afforded by such standard is the legitimate expectations of the foreign investor,
but with a limited scope. Thus, in the absence of a prior commitment by the State, the
investor cannot hold a legitimate expectation that the State will not exercise its power to
modify the legal framework applicable to the investment and no violation of the standard

arises.*”

306. The absence of such commitment is evident in the instant case, since, in the Respondent’s
opinion and in accordance with the international case law it has invoked: (i) policy
statements create no legitimate expectation whatsoever; (ii) general statements included in a

treaty or law, which by nature may evolve, cannot be regarded as commitments undertaken

 

vis-a-vis the investor; and (iii) a commitment may be specific in nature if “its very purpose

was to offer the investor an actual stability guarantee’

[Tribunal’s Translation]. Bolivia
considers that the Claimants have failed to show the existence of such commitment because
such commitment does not exist. What is more, in the Respondent’s view, the laws, licenses

Claimants refer cannot have led the Claimants to invest in Bolivia in 1995 and 2006. It is

absurd to suggest that, had the above clause never existed, the Claimants would not have

contributed capital or other assets (which the Claimants call an “investment”) to EGSA after
March 2006, or that all statutory amendments must always be favourable to the investor. In
any case, the guarantees offered by a State in its regulatory framework can only play a
persuasive or dissuasive role in the investor’s decision whether or not to invest in a country.
Furthermore, the Respondent denies that the Claimants were unwilling to sign the 2010
Dignity Tariff Agreement or that they did so against their will. Seeing as a total of 19
companies from the electricity sector executed said agreement, it would be impossible to

explain how Bolivia could have forced all of them to do so.*!°

308. On the other hand, in order to find a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under
the Treaties and international law, the Claimants must show that Bolivia adopted drastic,
unreasonable, unjustified or discriminatory measures.*'® Nevertheless, the Claimants
mention no such characteristics. In addition, Respondent believes that asserting (as the
Claimants do) that a reasonable and justifiable modification of the “rules of the game”
[Tribunal’s Translation] by the State is an unfair measure contrary to the Treaties is a
ridiculous position from a legal standpoint. The Tribunal may not replace the State in its
regulatory task and determine whether or not such measure complied with the Electricity
Law and the efficiency principle. Besides, Econ One demonstrated that such measure had

“objective” standard of “vigilance” which is violated by the “mere lack or want of

diligence”.*” Likewise, it is a standard requiring the active conduct of the host State in
taking “all measure of precaution to protect the investments.” Moreover, the Claimants
believe that the withdrawal by the host State of the legal protection and security previously
granted to an investment constitutes a violation of such standard, and that this has been

recognized in international case law.”

310. Therefore, in the Claimants’ view, such standard includes Bolivia’s duty to actively protect
the investments that the Claimants had made, while applying the legal, regulatory and
contractual framework that had been established so as to ensure the viability and legal and
economic protection of the Claimants’ investments, without limiting such protection to mere

- In the Respondent’s opinion, a modification of the regulatory framework may not give rise to
a violation of the full protection and security standard even according to the case law cited
by the Claimants themselves, especially as it was a change introduced in accordance with the
regulatory framework applicable to the investment. It was a reasonable and justified
measure.” Hence, Bolivia considers that the Claimants’ interpretation of the case law
simply equates the standard to the fair and equitable treatment standard, such that, if the
Tribunal finds that Bolivia did not breach the fair and equitable treatment standard, it also
could not have violated the full protection and security standard.’ The Respondent
highlights that the above-cited cases constitute a “minority” position that has been criticized

by other case law, which holds that the full protection and security standard is intended to

312. The Respondent insists that it never agreed not to alter the regulatory framework. In fact, the
opposite can be inferred. In any event, such modification had exerted a significant impact
nor curtailed the investment made by the Claimants. Therefore, such statutory amendment
cannot be deemed to have violated the full protection and security standard provided for in

the Treaties.’”°

The Claimants’ Arguments

a

. The Claimants maintain that, as with the two standards described above, the standard of
reasonableness of the conduct of the host State also constitutes a flexible and broad standard
to which a similar analysis applies as above. Hence, the Claimants state that Respondent
cannot be said to have acted reasonably when it altered a key aspect of the regulatory
framework such as the calculation of spot prices. This is not a behaviour that the parties to a
treaty could have anticipated or expected in light of the provisions and goals of such

instruments to promote and protect investments.”

314. In addition, the Claimants argue that the standard applicable to the provisions of both
Treaties is identical, though their drafting may differ: an unreasonable measure is illegal
regardless of whether it is also discriminatory. Despite the lack of an express reference to the
term “arbitrary”, the terms “arbitrary” and “unreasonable” are used interchangeably in

investment treaties, and arbitral tribunals have drawn no distinction between them. Lastly, on

the basis of all the evidence furnished, such measure was neither reasonable nor justified.“

315. In view of all the allegations made as to the spot price measure adopted in violation of the
standards presented so far, the Claimants assert that a significant portion of EGSA’s profit
margin was eliminated, since such measure “affected [...] revenues and resulted in
financially assessable damage” by excluding liquid fuel units from the calculation.” In fact,
the spot price was EGSA’s primary source of income. The Claimants also affirm that EGSA
was obliged, given the high spot prices, to deposit a proportion of its revenues in the
stabilization fund. Such revenues were recorded as accounts receivable that were accessible
(with interest) when spot prices decreased. In any case, such revenues continued to belong to

316. The damages calculated as of 29 February 2012, based on data published by the CNDC, for
the “actual scenario” (EGSA’s actual revenues as a result of the spot price modification) and
the calculations made by MEC for the so-called “but-for scenario” (the revenues that EGSA
would have obtained had the foregoing modification not been adopted), using the average
WACC of 10.63% in relation to the Claimants’ stake in EGSA (50.001%), amount to USD
5.1 million. According to the Claimants, the calculation made by Econ One is incorrect for
the following reasons: (a) the CNDC study produces a much less accurate estimate than that
carried out by MEC, because the CNDC study did not use actual dispatch conditions from
September 2008 to May 2010, but rather simulated conditions according to mid-2008
estimates; (b) Econ One’s failure to use a “but-for” dispatch simulation to calculate post-
nationalisation spot-price revenues has the effect that demand growth and capacity additions

- However, the Claimants have not alleged that the measure is either discriminatory or
arbitrary, but only unreasonable. Consequently, in the absence of such categories, the
standard of non-impairment of the investment cannot be deemed to have been breached.** In
fact, the Claimants argued that Operating Rule No. 3/2008 had been unreasonable from an
economic standpoint, but failed to describe it as arbitrary, requesting that the Tribunal
consider both terms (unreasonable and arbitrary) as interchangeable and, thus, that the
meaning of the term “arbitrary” contained in the UK-Bolivia BIT be supplanted with a

different notion. However, the term “arbitrary” is not a synonym of “unreasonable”.

319. By virtue of the foregoing analysis of the relevant standards, the Respondent considers that
the Claimants have failed to demonstrate that the spot price modification has had any effect
on their investment. On the contrary, as far as the Respondent is concerned, it provided
sufficient evidence that such measure was not unreasonable and that the alleged economic
impact thereof upon the Claimants is inaccurate and, in any case, excessive, since, according
to Econ One, EGSA’s losses amounted to USD 2.2 million.** Nor have the Claimants taken
into consideration the impact of the tariff stabilization in effect in Bolivia since 2003. In
Econ One’s opinion, this circumstance renders the scenario proposed by the Claimants
impossible.***

320.The Respondent points out that the funds mentioned by the Claimants are deposited
indefinitely and only recovered in the event of the reduction of spot prices, as a consequence
of which they do not have the same value as if they were EGSA’s liquid assets. Even if the

stabilization funds were EGSA’s accounts receivable, the damage would be prospective and

4. Failure to Provide Effective Means to the Claimants

The Claimants’ Arguments

321. As the Claimants explain, and in accordance with the case law presented, the effective means
clause requires that the host State’s legal and judicial system work effectively. Unjustified
delay by the host State’s courts dealing with an investor’s claim may amount to a breach of
such standard. The Claimants draw attention to the fact that Article II(4) of the US-Bolivia
BIT makes no reference whatsoever to denial of justice. Nor does the provision refer to
customary international law or link “effective means” with denial of justice. Therefore, the
standard applicable in the instant case is not one that prohibits particularly egregious conduct
only. The applicable standard is nothing other than what the Treaty itself establishes: Bolivia
must provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights. Furthermore, the
Claimants argue that this standard can be imported into the UK-Bolivia BIT by way of the
MEN clause without giving rise to any abuse, since, as confirmed by case law, this clause is

specially designed to harmonize all the standards of investment protection.*”

322.In light of the foregoing, the Claimants believe that the Bolivian judicial system has not
worked effectively, since their claims in connection with the modification of the PBP are still
pending, in breach of the effective means standard, and thus, in violation of the Treaties.**
This conclusion is reached regardless of the comparison the Bolivian judicial system with
other legal systems in terms of delays, as it is irrelevant whether Bolivian courts are equally

slow for everyone or whether other countries also lack effective means. The obligation to

ensure effective means is objective. In any event, the delays that the Claimants have faced

have been for the most part caused by institutional defects.”

323. Likewise, the Claimants argue that it is up to Respondent to demonstrate that the situation
would have been mitigated if certain domestic remedies had been used. Nonetheless,
provisional measures are only available in civil proceedings, and not in contentious-
administrative cases. In any event, the Supreme Court was dormant, and there is
consequently no basis to conclude that such application could have given rise to interim
relief that would have protected EGSA. Nor would such measures have been effective, given
that the nationalisation nullified the Claimants’ interest in May 2010. Lastly, the fact that the
Claimants’ litigation before the Supreme Court could have been unsuccessful should not
affect the Tribunal’s consideration as to whether or not Bolivia complied with the Treaties.
In any event, the causal link has been duly proven in accordance with the balance of
probabilities standard, and it can be concluded that EGSA’s appeal was more likely than not

to have succeeded if the Bolivian court system had worked properly.”

324. With regard to the compensation due on account of the PBP measure, Compass Lexecon
once again draws a distinction between an “actual scenario” (EGSA’s actual revenues as a
result of the modification) and a “but-for scenario” (the revenues EGSA would have
obtained had the PBP never been modified). In addition, the period from May 2007 to 2038
was divided between the pre- and post-nationalisation decree periods for the sake of clarity,
as different data are used for these two periods (CNDC’s information for the pre-
nationalisation period and MEC studies for the post-nationalisation period). Thus, by
correcting the mistakes made by Econ One in relation to the application of a very high
discount rate as well as other technical errors, the Claimants’ expert concluded that the

compensation due amounts to a total of USD 38 million as of 29 February 2012."

The Respondent’s Arguments

325. From Bolivia’s viewpoint, this is the only claim brought by the Claimants with respect to the

PBP, an obligation enshrined in the US-Bolivia BIT only. Accordingly, and together with the

arguments already put forward on its jurisdictional objections, the Respondent points out that
it was EGSA that lodged the appeals and that it is not a party to this arbitration, as a
consequence of which the Claimants’ reliance on a legal action to which they are not a party
only confirms that the Claimants have already chosen domestic courts as the appropriate
forum to hear the PBP dispute. As a result, in order for the Tribunal to reject the application
of the fork-in-the-road clause, it need to distinguish between the Claimants and EGSA, such
that the Tribunal should also carefully consider whether the Claimants have standing to bring

acclaim on account of a court delay affecting a proceeding in which they are not a party.“

326. Secondly, the Respondent asserts that the effective means standard may not be imported into
the United-Kingdom-Bolivia BIT by way of the MEN clause, as this would also require the
relevant negotiation process to be incorporated and applied to investors from the United
Kingdom. Therefore, the effect of the negotiation prerequisite cannot be escaped merely by
resorting to the MFN clause, especially where the purpose of such clause is to avert

discriminatory treatment by reason of investors’ nationality.“?

327.Should the Tribunal not accept the above argument, the Respondent argues that the
Claimants err when establishing the relevant time periods, seeing as they ceased to hold an
interest in EGSA’s operations on | May 2010, which means that as of that date the alleged
delay would be two years in relation to the appeal lodged against SSDE Resolution No. 40
and two years and one month with respect to that lodged against CNDE Resolution No.

209/2007."

328. In addition, according to Bolivia’s interpretation, for a breach of the standard to exist, the

Claimants must show the following:

(a) The existence of particularly egregious conduct on the part of the Bolivian judiciary,
while also taking into account that the establishment of an international wrong requires
that all domestic remedies must have been previously exhausted, which has not
occurred in the case at hand, given that the Claimants could have requested the
provisional suspension of the measures in the contentious-administrative forum. Hence,

they have themselves contributed to the delay; and

(b) The undue or unjustified nature of the periods during which the claims brought before
the Supreme Court were pending, taking into account the reasonable amount of time
that a State court might take in order to settle the dispute.“ In this sense, the duration of
the legal proceedings before the Supreme Court does not entail a denial of effective
means in accordance with the international case law invoked by both Parties.” These
were usual periods even in comparison with other States, as the Claimants’ witnesses
acknowledged.“ It is also not true that the reforms of the court system have produced
delays in contentious-administrative matters, but quite the opposite. In addition, the
statistics of cases admitted and adjudicated by the Supreme Court show more cases

admitted than adjudicated, which explains the backlog that accrued.”

329. Further, there is no causal link between the duration of the legal proceedings and EGSA’s
alleged loss of profits. The Respondent argues that, even if the Supreme Court decided to
compensate EGSA as the Claimants anticipate, such compensation would not benefit them,
since they no longer hold any interest whatsoever in EGSA’s operations, as they have
admitted themselves. Moreover, there is no reason to predict a favourable ruling by the court,
when all signs indicate otherwise. In any case, compensation is not due for speculative

damages; it is not sufficient to establish the likelihood of the damage to be subject to
compensation.*” By virtue of the foregoing, Respondent maintains that the Claimants’ claim
fails on account of a fact that they have not disputed: the Operating Rule’s consistency with
Bolivian law. Therefore, this aspect not having been questioned, the Claimants cannot

request that the Tribunal award compensation for hypothetical claims.”

330. Once again, the compensation requested by the Claimants is excessive, since apart from
resorting to Operating Rule No. 19/2007 in order to calculate the FMV, they also ignored the
impact of the tariff stabilization in effect in Bolivia since 2003. Accordingly, the study
prepared by Compass Lexecon corresponds to that conducted by Econ One as regards the
effect quantified for the first period, i.e., from May 2007 to April 2010. Nevertheless, they
differ in relation to the second period, i.e., from May 2010 onwards. According to Compass
Lexecon, the Claimants should receive USD 27.9 million, whereas Econ One estimates that
the Claimants should be awarded USD 12 million. Compass Lexecon presents a calculation
inflated by the impact of the projections made by MEC/EdI and applies the wrong interest
rate of 10.63%, while that used by Econ One is around 20%."

CHAPTER VIII - THE PARTIES’ RELIEF

 

UGHT ON THE MERITS

A. THE CLAIMANTS’ RELIEF SOUGHT

331. The Claimants request that the Tribunal:

(a) Declare that Bolivia has breached the Treaties and international law, and in particular,

that it has:

(i) expropriated the Claimants’ investments without prompt, just, adequate and
effective compensation, in violation of Article III of the US-Bolivia BIT, Article 5

of the UK-Bolivia BIT, and international law;

(ii) failed to accord the Claimants’ investments fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security, and impaired them through unreasonable and
discriminatory measures, in violation of Article II.3 of the US-Bolivia BIT and

Article 2(2) of the UK-Bolivia BIT; and

(iii) failed to provide the Claimants with effective means of asserting claims and
enforcing rights with respect to covered investments, in violation of Article II.4 of

the US-Bolivia BIT and Article 3 of the UK-Bolivia BIT.

(b

Order Bolivia to compensate the Claimants for Bolivia’s breaches of the Treaties and
international law in the amount of USD 136.4 million,** plus interest until full payment

of the award is made;

(c

Award such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and

@

Order Bolivia to pay the costs of these arbitration proceedings, including the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the institution selected to provide
appointing and administrative services and assistance to this arbitration, the fees and
expenses relating to the Claimants’ legal representation, and the fees and expenses of

any expert appointed by the Claimants or the Tribunal, plus interest.**

CHAPTER IX - DECISION ON JURISDICTION

333. The Tribunal will now proceed to examine the Respondent’s objections to its jurisdiction as

follows:

(a

(b

(c

@

(e

(g

Whether joinder or consolidation of distinct claims may be allowed in the absence of

specific consent from the Respondent;

Whether Rurelec is an investor and holds a protected investment;

Whether Bolivia is entitled to exercise the right of denial of benefits against GAI;

Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction in respect of the alleged New Claims;

Whether the alleged New Claims are domestic in nature;

Whether the alleged exercise of the fork-in-the-road clause bars the New Claims; and

Whether the claims regarding the spot price and Worthington engines are premature.

JOINDER OR CONSOLIDATION OF DISTINCT CLAIMS IN THE ABSENCE OF
SPECIFIC CONSENT FROM THE RESPONDENT

334. The Tribunal considers that the submission by the Claimants of identical claims based on the

alleged violation of two different BITs in a single arbitration proceeding is not subject to the

qualified express consent of the Respondent.

335. It is undisputed that, in the BITs concluded by Bolivia with the United Kingdom and United

States, the Respondent gave its consent to the arbitration of investment disputes with

investors from the UK and the US. Following a widespread treaty practice, this consent was

given through an open offer to submit to arbitration, expressed in Article 8 of the UK-

Bolivia BIT and in Article IX of the US-Bolivia BIT. It is also undisputed that each of the

Claimants duly accepted this offer of arbitration made by the Respondent in the Treaties,

giving rise to the “matching of consents” indispensable for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

rationae voluntatis over these disputes.

336. The offers of arbitration contained in the BITs were not subject to any condition or limitation

in their scope that would prevent the two Claimants from submitting a single, joint

arbitration case against the Respondent. Nor were they subject to any condition that

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 133 of 208

claimants in arbitration proceedings must ground their claims in just one BIT. Each of the
Claimants accepted the offer of arbitration in the precise terms in which it was given by the
Respondent, notably, providing consent by the Respondent that disputes over the application

of the Treaties were to be settled by recourse to arbitration.

337.One cannot therefore interpret the Treaties—using the well-known rules of treaty
interpretation of Article 31 of the VCLT—as if they contained some limitation of scope
preventing a claimant from submitting an arbitral claim together with another claimant when
both claims are based on the same alleged facts and on the same alleged breaches although
brought under different BITs, provided that each claimant provides its own independent

matching consent to arbitration.

338.In the Tribunal’s view, the issue raised by the Respondent of whether express consent
regarding the form of the present arbitration is required is also not an issue of “consolidation
of proceedings”. Indeed, in the instant case, the Claimants did not commence two separate
arbitrations in respect of two independent arbitral claims that have subsequently been
consolidated. The Claimants submitted, ab initio and in the same arbitration, two claims by
two claimants against one respondent, regarding the same dispute and involving the same set
of facts, albeit allegedly in violation of two different BITs concluded by the Respondent with
the UK and the US, respectively. It is clear that the object of both claims is the same, since
the allegedly unlawful action by Bolivia was also a single one, notwithstanding the fact that,
in practice, the present case concerns two identical and overlapping claims by two claimants

against the same respondent in the same arbitration proceeding.

339. On the other hand, in cases of consolidation of proceedings, the matching of consents with
respect to each of the arbitrations has already occurred. As such, the case law and literature
hold—as both Parties in this proceeding have also affirmed—that consent is required from
all parties involved in order to allow the merger of the two arbitrations into one. The
Tribunal considers that there is, therefore, no valid analogy to be made between this case and

cases of consolidation of proceedings.

340. The Tribunal therefore considers that, even if it would have been possible for the Claimants
to submit separate arbitral proceedings, nothing precludes them—given the obvious link
between both Claimants and the identity of the facts alleged—from deciding to jointly

submit a single arbitration case, albeit invoking different BITs.

341.The Tribunal disagrees with Respondent’s interpretation of the silence of the Treaties

concerning the possibility of multi-party arbitration. In the Tribunal’s opinion, this is not a

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 134 of 208

case where jurisdiction is being granted without the explicit consent of the parties. On the
contrary, the consent given by the Respondent is explicit and covers disputes involving
investors from each of those two States. The parties to the Treaties could have limited such
consent and, by extension, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; but they did not do so. In this
case, the Tribunal considers that the silence in the Treaties concerning the explicit possibility
of joint arbitrations plays against the Respondent’s point of view, since one cannot use

silence to limit the scope of the consent given.

342. The argument that there must be a specific consent in each of the BITs to the possibility of
joining different claims in the same arbitral proceeding ultimately goes too far. Were such
specific consent necessary, it would be impossible to accept, as the Respondent has argued,
that all prior multi-party arbitrations were only allowed to proceed because of the implicit
consent provided by the respondent States through their failure to raise any jurisdictional

objection in this regard.

343. The Tribunal fully agrees with the opinion expressed by the tribunal in Ambiente Ufficio v.
Argentina,’® holding that “it is evident that multi-party arbitration is a generally accepted
practice in ICSID arbitration, and in the arbitral practice beyond that, and that the
institution of multi-party proceedings therefore does not require any consent on the part of

the respondent Government beyond the general requirements of consent to arbitration."

344. With respect to the Claimants’ argument that the Tribunal’s discretion over the conduct of
the proceedings should be exercised to avoid unnecessary delay and expense (Article 17(1)
of the UNCITRAL Rules), the Tribunal finds that this is a rule governing questions of
procedure and is not (necessarily) applicable to the determination of the existence or not of

its jurisdiction.

345. The Tribunal, while cognisant of the differences between the present case and Noble Energy
v. Ecuador (in which there was more than one claimant, alleging different disputes and
invoking more than one cause of action—even if based on the same facts), agrees with that
tribunal’s statement that “[i]n the further course of this arbitration, the parties and the
Tribunal will have to distinguish each dispute under its own applicable rules, even though
facts, evidence and arguments may be common to all or some of them.”*** Hence, the

RL-20) 4206.

 

 

PCA Case No. 2011-17

Page 135 of 208

Respondents assertion that differences exist between both BITs is irrelevant, given that the
Tribunal is prepared to analyse each Claimant’s claims—which are in essence one and the
same claim—in accordance with the applicable BIT invoked by each Claimant. The same
rationale would also apply to any possible counter-claims brought by the Respondent. There
is no fundamental incompatibility between the consents to arbitration in the two BITs that
would result in one or the other consent being violated by the mere fact of the claims being

heard together.

346. Thus, on the grounds that the consent to arbitration provided by the Respondent in the
Treaties contains no limitation that would preclude the joint submission by two or more
Claimants of identical claims under different BITs, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent
has given its consent to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to hear the claims submitted jointly
by GAI and Rurelec in accordance with Article IX of the US-Bolivia BIT and Article 8 of
the UK-Bolivia BIT.

347. Consequently, the Tribunal will proceed to analyse the remainder of the objections to its
jurisdiction raised by the Respondent in relation to each of the Claimants and in accordance

with the Treaties invoked by each of them.

B. RURELEC’S STATUS AS AN INVESTOR AND ITS OWNERSHIP OF A PROTECTED
INVESTMENT

348. In regard to the Respondent’s objection that Rurelec is not a protected investor under the
UK-Bolivia BIT, the Tribunal considers that Rurelec has provided sufficient evidence that it
has acquired GAI and has therefore made an indirect investment in Bolivia—even though it
has not provided any documentary evidence to prove that the payment for that acquisition

was made.

349. Evidence has been provided of the purchase of BIE on 12 December 2005 and that Rurelec

459

therefore indirectly owns shares in EGSA.”” High-level Bolivian entities have consistently

accepted and recognized that Rurelec is the ultimate owner of these shares.

350. The Respondent cited the case of Quiborax v. Bolivia in support of the contention that no
investment exists through a shareholding if there is no payment for those shares. The

Tribunal notes, however, that Quiborax v. Bolivia was an ICSID case where the tribunal

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 136 of 208

decided to analyse whether the “investor” had an investment under Article 25 of the
Washington Convention. In fact, as regards the applicable BIT, the Quiborax tribunal
concluded without further elaboration that “Bolivia does not contest that the Claimants have

made an ‘investment’ within the meaning of the BIT’!

35

. Furthermore, the Tribunal need not decide if the indirect acquisition of the shares of EGSA
took place in 2006 or 2009 since the critical date is the date of the nationalisation, and the
Tribunal is convinced that the indirect acquisition of EGSA’s shares took place before the
date of the nationalisation. By acquiring the shares previously owned by other entities,

Rurelec also acquired and benefits from protection for investments made prior to said

 

acquisition. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Rurelec effectively acquired the shares of

BIE through Birdsong and thereby made an indirect investment in Bolivia.

352. As regards the Respondent’s argument that indirect investments are not protected under the
UK-Bolivia BIT, the Tribunal notes that Article | contains—as the majority of BITs do—a
very broad definition of “investment”. Article 1 defines “investment” as “every kind of asset
which is capable of producing returns,’ which would naturally include “indirect
investments” through the acquisition of shares in a company. In addition, the non-exhaustive
list of protected investments described in the BIT explicitly includes the example of “shares
in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a
company”. Finally, in its broadest example, Article 1(a)(iii) of the BIT provides that any
“claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value” are

considered to be protected investments under the BIT.

353. In the Tribunal’s opinion, all of the above mentioned examples contribute to the conclusion
that indirect investments were intended to be protected by the UK-Bolivia BIT. Moreover,
given that the purpose of the BIT is to promote and protect foreign investment, the Tribunal
considers that the BIT would require clear language in order to exclude coverage of indirect

investments—language that the BIT does not contain.

354. According to the Tribunal, the fact, invoked by the Respondent, that other BITs concluded
by Bolivia explicitly include indirect investments, is insufficient to support an a contrario
sensu interpretation that only those BITs containing such an explicit reference cover indirect
investments, since it is well accepted that this kind of argument is not on its own strong

enough to justify a particular interpretation of a rule of law. The mere absence of an explicit

mention of the different categories of investment (direct and indirect) cannot be interpreted

as narrowing the definition of investment under the BIT to only direct investment.

355. The Tribunal therefore agrees with the Claimants and concludes that terms employed in the
UK-Bolivia BIT are broad enough on their own to include indirect investments, even without
employing further qualifications that would only reinforce what is already clear from the text

of the BIT.

356. The Tribunal has also considered the case law cited by both Parties on this issue and agrees
with the decision in Cemex v. Venezuela,’ whose rationale the Tribunal also finds to be

applicable to the present case:

“The Tribunal further notes that, when the BIT mentions investments ‘of’ nationals of
the other Contracting Party, it means that those investments must belong to such
nationals in order to be covered by the Treaty. But this does not imply that they must
be ‘directly’ owned by those nationals. Similarly, when the BIT mentions investments
made ‘in’ the territory of a Contracting Party, all it requires is that the investment
itself be situated in that territory. It does not imply that those investments must be

‘directly’ made in such territory.

Thus, as recognized by several arbitral tribunals in comparable cases, the Claimants
have jus standi in the present case. The Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal

jurisdiction under the BIT cannot be upheld.“

The line of comparable cases cited by the Cemex tribunal includes Siemens v. Argentina,“

Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia, Tza Yap Shum v. Peru,*® and Mobil v. Venezuela.”

[German/Argentine BIT]. The definition of ‘investment’ is very broad. An investment is any kind of asset considered to be
under the law of the Contracting Party where the investment has been made. The specific categories of investment included
in the definition are included as examples rather than with the purpose of excluding those not listed. The drafters were
careful to use the words ‘not exclusively’ before listing the categories of ‘particularly’ included investments. One of the
categories consists of ‘shares, rights of participation in companies and other type of participation in companies’. The plain
meaning of this provision is that shares held by a German shareholder are protected under the Treaty. The Treaty does not
require that there be no interposed companies between the investment and the ultimate owner of the company. Therefore a
literal reading of the Treaty does not support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.”

Page 138 of 208

357.The Tribunal notes that the UK-Bolivia BIT was (according to its preamble) designed to
“create favourable conditions for greater investment by nationals and companies of one
State in the territory of the other State”. Furthermore, the parties agreed in Article 2 of the
said BIT that “each contracting party shall encourage and create favourable conditions for
nationals or companies of the other Contracting party to invest in its territory, and, subject

to its right to exercise powers conferred by its laws, shall admit such capital.”

358. As for the Respondent’s argument that Rurelec’s investment was not made in the territory of
Bolivia, the Tribunal considers that the reference in the BIT to the territory of a Contracting
Party (as found, for example, in Article 2) cannot be interpreted in such a manner to exclude
indirect investments, as long as the ultimate investment that was allegedly expropriated is

located in the territory of a Contracting Party, in this case Bolivia.

359. The eligibility of indirect investments under the BIT is shown inter alia by the Contracting
Parties’ express agreement in Article 1(a)(ii) that “shares in and stock and debentures of a
company and any other form of participation in a company” constitute protected
investments. Hence, it must follow that the acquisition of said shares may also take place

outside the territory of the Contracting Party.

360. The Tribunal thus concludes that the best interpretation of Article 2(2) of the BIT, when it
refers to “investments of nationals”, is the one that considers that the investments may
belong to nationals of one Contracting Party, both directly or indirectly through equity
ownership of the companies that own the ultimate investment in Bolivia, in this case EGSA.

The Tribunal consequently finds itself in agreement with the decision in the case of

 

Quiborax v. Bolivia where it was held that “the evidence shows that Quiborax paid for 51%
of the shares of NMM. Regardless of where the payment was made, this qualifies as a
contribution of money because the object of the payment and raison d’étre of the transaction

-the mining concessions— were located in Bolivia."

361. The Tribunal rejects the argument put forward by the Respondent restricting the application
of Article 5(2) of the BIT to direct investments in a company that is incorporated or
constituted under the laws in force in the territory of the host State. If one accepts that the
ownership of shares can be direct or indirect through the ownership of other shares in other
companies, the fact that Rurelec does not directly own the shares of EGSA does not mean
that it does not own those shares within the meaning of the BIT, indirectly through

intermediate companies such as Birdsong, BIE, and GAI.

362.The Tribunal further considers that the fact that the companies Birdsong and BIE are
incorporated in the British Virgin Islands—in whose territory the BIT is not applicable—is
not relevant, since none of them is a claimant in this arbitration and, according to the BIT,

only the Claimants need to be nationals of a Contracting Party.

363. The Tribunal does not deem it necessary to carry out a comparative interpretation between
the Spanish and the English versions of the BIT concerning the definition of “returns” as
necessarily coming from an investment of capital. The Tribunal considers that the acquisition
of EGSA’s shares, directly or indirectly, represents per se an investment of capital in the

territory of Bolivia and is consequently protected by both versions of the BIT.

364. The Tribunal also considers that it is not appropriate to import “objective” definitions of
investment created by doctrine and case law in order to interpret Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention when in the context of a non-ICSID arbitration such as the present case. On the
contrary, the definition of protected investment, at least in non-ICSID arbitrations, is to be
obtained only from the (very broad) definition contained in the BIT concluded by Bolivia
and the United Kingdom. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that Romak*® and Alps

470

Finance” are very “fact-specific” cases that can partially explain their reasoning, which

remains exceptional in the case law outside the ICSID system.

365. For all the above reasons, and based on the proper textual interpretation of the UK-Bolivia
BIT, the Tribunal concludes that Rurelec’s indirect investments in EGSA should be
considered as “investments” within the meaning of that term as defined in Article 1 of the

UK-Bolivia BIT.

C. BOLIVIA’s RIGHT OF DENIAL OF BENEFITS AGAINST GAI

366. In accordance with Article XII of the US-Bolivia BIT, “[e]ach party reserves the right to
deny to a company of the other Party the benefits of this Treaty if nationals of a third country
own or control the company and [...] (b) the company has no substantial business activities

in the territory of the Party under whose laws it is constituted or organized.”

367. Considering the requirements of Article XII, the Tribunal must determine whether the denial
is valid rationae materiae, which requires that the Tribunal be convinced that GAI is owned
or controlled by a national of a third country (other than the US) and that GAI has no
substantial business activities in the US. Further, the Tribunal must also determine whether
the denial of benefits is valid rationae temporis, which requires that the Tribunal be

convinced as to the timeliness of the denial of benefits.

368. The Claimants stated that Bolivia had required the establishment of a single purpose vehicle
(“SPV”) as a condition for the public tender of EGSA, which allegation is disputed by the
Respondent. The Claimants also assert that GAI has “substantial business activities” in the
USA and cannot, therefore, be considered a shell company under the control of the British

Virgin Islands’ company.

369. After examining of all the available evidence, the Tribunal concludes that it has not been
shown that Bolivia imposed, whether in the terms of reference for the privatisation of
EGSA*" or afterwards, any requirement that GAI must be an SPV, let alone an American
one, nor has it been shown that this company was not allowed to own any assets other than

EGSA shares.

370. The Tribunal is also convinced that GAI is a company that, for the purposes of Article XII of
the US-Bolivia BIT, “has no substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under
whose laws it is constituted or organized.” Insufficient evidence has been provided to prove
that GAI carried on substantial business activities in the US at any point in time. Finally,
GAI is owned and controlled by nationals of a third country, namely, BIE, Birdsong

Overseas, and ultimately Rurelec, none of them being a US company.

371.Since the initial hurdle in order to invoke the denial of benefits has been overcome, the
Tribunal will now examine its timeliness. The Tribunal is cognizant of the fact that the

Respondent only denied the benefits of the BIT in its Statement of Defence, after both

*”' See Exhibit C-7.

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 141 of 208

parties had already given their consent to arbitration. Nevertheless, the denial of benefits
cannot be equated to the withdrawal of prior arbitral consent, which is only permissible prior

to the acceptance of the host State’s consent by the investor.

372. Whenever a BIT includes a denial of benefits clause, the consent by the host State to
arbitration itself is conditional and thus may be denied by it, provided that certain objective
requirements concerning the investor are fulfilled. All investors are aware of the possibility

of such a denial, such that no legitimate expectations are frustrated by that denial of benefits.

373. No one can accept more than what is being offered. In this case, what was offered by both
Bolivia and the US, in the BIT concluded between them, was a package of benefits to
investors of both countries, including the benefit of being able to submit disputes to
arbitration, coupled with an express prior reservation of the right to deny those benefits if
and when the Respondent so decides (subjective requirement) and if the investor’s company
is or becomes a “shell company” controlled by a company incorporated in a third country
(objective requirement). The reservation of the right of denial of benefits contained in Article
XII operates on the Contracting Parties’ offer of consent to arbitration as much as every
other benefit conferred by the BIT. Hence, any US investor who invests in Bolivia already
knows in advance of the possibility of a denial of benefits by Bolivia—as long as the Article
XII requirements are met—and, if it decides to accept the offer of arbitration made by

Bolivia in the BIT, it accepts it at face value.

374. Without prejudice to the fact that an investor (irrespective of whether the investment has
been made before or after the entry into force of the BIT) is in principle protected by the
BIT, it also bears noting that GAI (and its shareholders) did not enjoy the protection of the
investment treaty when they decided to bid in the privatization process. Evidence has also
been submitted that GAI and Rurelec had been worried about the risk of nationalisation since

at least 2006.

375. This being the case, following the signature and final ratification of the BIT, the Claimants
were fully aware of the denial of benefits clause and could have acted in such a way as to
preclude the Respondent from being able to invoke that clause, and thereby avoid the risk of
a denial of benefits, by having GAI undertake substantial activities in the USA or through
some other equivalent solution. That did not happen. The Tribunal therefore finds that the
Claimants’ reliance on the pacta sunt servanda principle is misplaced since the denial of

benefits clause is part of the “pactum” agreed by the Contracting Parties.

376.

377.

379.

380.

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 142 of 208

The same must be said in relation to the supposedly retroactive application of the clause. The
Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimants when they argue that the Respondent is precluded
from applying the denial of benefits clause retroactively. The very purpose of the denial of
benefits is to give the Respondent the possibility of withdrawing the benefits granted under
the BIT to investors who invoke those benefits. As such, it is proper that the denial is

“activated” when the benefits are being claimed.

The Contracting Parties to the BIT could have agreed otherwise, but they decided not to do
so. Instead they agreed that a Contracting Party could deny benefits (including the benefit of
having a dispute decided by an arbitral tribunal) subject to meeting certain conditions, none
of which entails that such denial is only effective in relation to disputes arising after the
notification of such denial or imposes any other limitation period that would occur before the

Respondent’s submission of its Statement of Defence.

On the contrary, the Tribunal agrees that the denial can and usually will be used whenever an
investor decides to invoke one of the benefits of the BIT. It will be on that occasion that the
respondent State will analyse whether the objective conditions for the denial are met and, if
so, decide on whether to exercise its right to deny the benefits contained in the BIT, up to the

submission of its statement of defence.

As a matter of fact, it would be odd for a State to examine whether the requirements of
Article XII had been fulfilled in relation to an investor with whom it had no dispute
whatsoever. In that case, the notification of the denial of benefits would—per se—be seen as
an unfriendly and groundless act, contrary to the promotion of foreign investments. On the
other side, the fulfilment of the aforementioned requirements is not static and can change
from one day to the next, which means that it is only when a dispute arises that the
respondent State will be able to assess whether such requirements are met and decide

whether it will deny the benefits of the treaty in respect of that particular dispute.

The Tribunal further notes that in this particular case (contrary to what occurred in the Plama
case) the investment did not follow the entry into force of the BIT but was made prior to the
BIT’s entry into force. The benefits contained in the BIT thus did not play any role in the

decision of the investor to make this investment. In the Plama case, the tribunal emphasized

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 143 of 208

the fact that the investor had relied on the protection afforded by the BIT when deciding

whether to invest in the respondent State.“””

38

- The consequence of the denial of benefits is that the Tribunal (which forms part of the
package of benefits afforded under the BIT) will be deprived of jurisdiction over the present
dispute. Accordingly, as a jurisdictional issue, it must be raised at the latest in the
respondent’s statement of defence, as it was here. Although it is perhaps unusual for both the
fact that leads to a lack of jurisdiction and the submission of the related jurisdictional
objection to arise at the same time, nothing prevents both (the act that forms the basis of the

plea and the plea itself) from coinciding as they do here.

382. The Tribunal therefore considers that the objection to jurisdiction was made in good time,
taking into account Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The Tribunal agrees with the
decision of the Ulysseas Inc. v. Ecuador*” when it states that “[a]ecording to the UNCITRAL
rules, a jurisdictional objection must be raised not later than the statement of defence
(Article 21(3) [equivalent to Article 23(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules 2010]). By exercising
the right to deny Claimant the BIT’s advantages in the Answer, Respondent has complied
with the time limit prescribed by the UNCITRAL Rules. Nothing in Article I(2) of the BIT
excludes that the right to deny the BIT’s advantages be exercised by the State at the time

when such advantages are sought by the investor through a request for arbitration.”

383. The Tribunal is cognisant that this puts the investor in something of a fragile position, since
the investor will never know if there might be a denial of benefits exactly when the investor
needs them the most. At the same time, one cannot say that such a denial will come as a total
surprise for the investor, since the BIT is not secret and we are dealing in this case with an
investor who has opted to use an investment vehicle controlled by a company of a third
country, which has no substantial business activities in the territory of the Contracting Party

under whose laws it is constituted or organized.

384. For all the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes, in accordance with Article XII of the US-

Bolivia BIT, that it has no jurisdiction to entertain GAI’s claims against the Respondent.

D. JURISDICTION IN RESPECT OF THE ALLEGED NEW CLAIMS

385.The Tribunal observes that the UK-Bolivia BIT contains a typical “cooling off period”
clause. In fact, Article 8 of the BIT determines that “[d]isputes between a national or
company of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an
obligation of the latter under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which
have not been legally and amicably settled shall after a period of six months from written

of a claim be 1 to international arbitration if either party to the dispute

so wishes” [emphasis added].

386. The Tribunal is mindful that the particular circumstances of the present case might allow one
to surmise that applying the general “cooling off’ period envisaged in the BIT to the so-
called “New Claims” would be a waste of time. Indeed, the fact that Bolivia has expropriated

Rurelec’s*”

investment leads the Tribunal to believe that the practical effects sought to be
achieved by the cooling off theory and rule would in the end have been non-existent.
Nevertheless, Rurelec was fully aware of the rule at play here and it would not have been
difficult to comply with the cooling off period, which did not in fact occur. The Tribunal has

no mandate to “rewrite” the BIT.

387.The Tribunal considers that the “New Claims” are distinct and separate from the “main
claim” for compensation for the nationalisation of EGSA. However, this does not mean that
the Tribunal will not examine the issue of capacity payments and spot prices when deciding
on the substantive aspects of the expropriation: it will do so, but only to check whether those
measures could be construed, as alleged by Rurelec, as the initial steps of a “creeping

expropriation”.

388. The explicit wording requiring a written notification and the expiry of a period of six months
from that notification leads the Tribunal to consider that the “cooling off period” narrows the

consent given by the Contracting Parties to international arbitration.

389. It is not up to the Tribunal to evaluate the importance or effect of such a condition, but
simply to acknowledge that it was agreed by the two Contracting Parties as a condition
precedent to the availability of an arbitral forum which is, and must be, based on consent.

The fact is that the Contracting Parties only gave their consent to arbitration subject to the

47 Given its decision that it lacks jurisdiction over GAI, and for simplicity’s sake, this Award will from now on refer only to
the remaining single Claimant, Rurelec, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 145 of 208

existence of a written notification of a claim and subject to the passing of six months’ time

between such notification and any request of arbitration.

The Tribunal thus concludes that, at least in this case, the “cooling off period” is a
jurisdictional barrier conditioning the jurisdiction of the Tribunal rationae voluntatis, since it
is not up to a claimant to decide whether and when to notify the host State of the dispute, just
as it is not up to such claimant to decide how long they must wait before submitting the

request for arbitration.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that no explicit notification has been made in
relation to the so-called “New Claims” and thus the cooling off period has been breached.
The Tribunal notes that Rurelec has acted in accordance with this very interpretation of the
BIT in respect of its claim regarding the nationalisation, as is mentioned by the Respondent
in its Memorial on Jurisdiction.” In particular, in its Notice of Arbitration, Rurelec states
that the applicable waiting periods found in the Treaties had already passed’ and
“[alccordingly, the Dispute is validly submitted to arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules
pursuant to Article IX.3(iii) of the US Treaty and Article 8(2), final paragraph, of the UK

ATT

Treaty respectively” [emphasis added].

It is irrelevant for the issue at hand whether it could be anticipated—by Rurelec or even by
this Tribunal—that nothing would happen during said six-month period and that the
Respondent would not react to the notification and take advantage of the chance to
negotiation a resolution. The “cooling off period” clause imposes an obligation of means and
not an obligation of result. All clauses of the BIT must be given equal effect and, if the
Contracting Parties gave their consent subject to those conditions, Rurelec could only accept
the offer of arbitration as it was presented and not as it would have liked to receive it.’ The
Tribunal thus feels no need to elaborate any further on what it believes the Respondent’s

behaviour would have been if it had been properly notified.

The Tribunal also agrees with the decision of the Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina case, Decision on Admissibility and

Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, 9570-585, and the decision of JCS v. Argentina case, Award on Jurisdiction, 10 February
2012, 4263-273. According to the latter decision: “[tJhe Tribunal cannot therefore create exceptions to treaty rules where
these are merely based upon an assessment of the wisdom of the policy in question, having no basis in either the treaty text or
in any supplementary interpretive source, however desirable such policy considerations might be seen to be in the abstract”
267).

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 146 of 208

393. The Tribunal’s analysis is in line with the decision of the tribunal in JCS v. Argentina*”

where it stated as follows:

“At the time of commencing dispute resolution under the treaty, the investor can only
accept or decline the offer to arbitrate, but cannot vary its terms. The investor,
regardless of the particular circumstances affecting the investor or its belief in the
utility or fairness of the conditions attached to the offer of the host State, must
nonetheless contemporaneously consent to the application of the terms and conditions

of the offer made by the host State, or else no agreement to arbitrate may be formed”.

394. Moreover, the notification of the dispute and the “cooling off period” were requirements that
could easily have been met by Rurelec, since there exists no obligation to reach an amicable
agreement. Thus, Rurelec cannot bemoan the fact that it is inefficient and costly to submit a
new request for arbitration concerning those claims; it was within their control to act

differently and in accordance with the BIT’s conditions in respect of the New Claims.

395. Another line of argument put forward by Rurelec was that the notifications submitted to
Bolivia in respect of the initial claim for nationalisation were broad enough to cover and
include the New Claims. The Tribunal will therefore turn to the content of those notifications
of the dispute in order to determine whether, as they were made, they encompass all the

claims subsequently submitted to this Tribunal, including the supposedly “New Claims”.

396. According to Rurelec, “the claims regarding spot prices, capacity payments and the
Worthington engines are all related to the notified nationalization dispute and therefore the
Claimants complied with any requirements the Treaties may impose.” The Tribunal cannot
agree with Rurelec’s position regarding the spot prices and capacity payments, since it
considers that it has not been demonstrated that those regulatory changes—made years
before the nationalisation—were connected to the nationalisation dispute, let alone that they

formed part of that dispute. The Tribunal thus cannot accept Rurelec’s allegation that the

481

“New Claims” “arise out of the same dispute.

397.The Tribunal observes that, according to the definition of the “Dispute” provided in
Rurelec’s request for arbitration, disputes concerned only the nationalisation decree and its

consequences:*?

“4. As described in more detail in Section II below, this dispute concerns the
Government's 1 May 2010 expropriation of the Claimants’ investments in the power
generation sector in Bolivia, specifically Rurelec’s 50.001% shareholding in Empresa
Electrica Guaracachi S.A. (Guaracachi), held through Guaracachi America, without
the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation in violation of the

Treaties and international law (the Dispute).

6. The Dispute arose on I May 2010, the date of the expropriation of the Claimants’
investments. Bolivia has been formally on notice of the Dispute since 13 May 2010,
the date on which the Claimants submitted notifications of the Dispute under the
Treaties to the Government (the Notices of Dispute). The amicable negotiation periods
of three months pursuant to US Treaty Article IX.3(a) and six months pursuant to UK
Treaty Article 8(1) have elapsed. Despite the Claimants’ intensive efforts, the parties

have been unable to reach an amicable settlement of their Dispute.”

398. Therefore, when Rurelec stated in its Notice of Dispute**

that “nothing in this letter should
be considered as limitation of any kind on issues of fact or law, which Rurelec may invoke
before an international arbitral tribunal,” that disclaimer can only be understood as
comprising the possibility of new claims related to that dispute and not new claims from new
(albeit factually older) disputes. Furthermore, the Tribunal notes that Rurelec never claimed
that there had been a creeping expropriation but rather that there was a direct
expropriation/nationalisation, which leads to the conclusion that, even for Rurelec, the prior
events they invoke should be characterized as representing different disputes that were only

for the first time asserted in the Statement of Claim.

399. The Tribunal recalls that, in CMS v. Argentina, cited by Rurelec,™ the notification of the
dispute related to a claim that was followed (after the notification) by a new, further claim

which was not individually notified (because it did not exist at the time of the notification).

Page 148 of 208

Meanwhile, in the present case, the facts are quite different, or more correctly, exactly the
opposite. The notification of a claim cannot be interpreted as incorporating previous
potential claims that were not asserted in the notification even though they were already in

existence (and known by Rurelec) at the time of such notification.

400. As to the Worthington engines, the Tribunal considers that the issue could be more

401.

complicated and deserve further analysis. However, seeing as the parties have already settled

that part of the dispute, it is not necessary to address it further.

As opposed to the UK-Bolivia BIT, the US-Bolivia BIT seems not to impose a duty of
notification on GAI and only stipulates, in Article IX 3(a), that the dispute may be submitted
to arbitration after “three months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose.” If
the Tribunal had not already concluded that it lacked jurisdiction in respect of the claims of
GAI, the Tribunal would have had to carefully analyse how that provision should be applied,
and would have had to determine the point at which that dispute arose in the context of
Article IX(3)(a) of the BIT. However, the Tribunal does not have to decide this issue given

its decision accepting Bolivia’s denial of benefits towards GAI.

E. THE DOMESTIC NATURE OF THE ALLEGED NEW CLAIMS

402. The Tribunal finds that, for jurisdictional purposes, the characterization of the claims should

in principle be accepted prima facie as put forward by Rurelec. In this case, it seems that the

New Claims could be accepted as treaty claims for jurisdictional purposes.

403. The Tribunal, however, sees no need to decide this issue since it has already decided that it

does not have jurisdiction over said claims due to the fact that the “cooling off period” was
not complied with by Rurelec and due to the fact that it has found Bolivia’s denial of benefits

towards GAT to be valid and effective.

F. THE ALLEGED EXERCISE OF THE FORK IN THE ROAD CLAUSE

404. The Tribunal notes that an analysis of the claims submitted to the Bolivian courts would be

necessary in order to compare it with the claim submitted before this Tribunal in order to
make a decision concerning whether the “fork in the road” clause precluded arbitration of the
latter claims. In addition, the Tribunal notes that the UK-Bolivia BIT does not contain a

“fork in the road” clause analogous to Article IX(3)(a) of the US-Bolivia BIT.

Page 149 of 208

405. In any event, given the Tribunal’s decision concerning Rurelec’s non-compliance with the
“cooling off period” and Bolivia’s denial of benefits to GAI, which result in a lack of
jurisdiction to hear the New Claims, the Tribunal need not decide on the alleged effect of the

“fork in the road” clause.

G. ALLEGED PREMATURE EXERCISE OF SPOT PRICE AND WORTHINGTON
ENGINES

406. The Tribunal considers that the New Claims were not prima facie premature since there was
no obligation to submit those claims to Bolivia’s domestic courts as a condition precedent to
recourse to an international tribunal. Nonetheless, for the same reasons given in the

preceding paragraphs, the Tribunal need not decide this particular issue either.

CHAPTER X - DECISION ON THE MERITS

A. THE SITUATION OF THE BOLIVIAN ELECTRICITY INDUSTRY AND ENDE
BEFORE THE PRIVATIZATION PROCESS

407. The description of the evolution of Bolivia’s economy, ENDE’s financial situation until the
start of the privatization of the electricity sector, and the reasons behind Bolivia’s strategy in
respect of these issues are not fully agreed between the Parties. However, this difference of
opinion is not material to the outcome of this arbitration. Irrespective of the situation and the
motivation for commencing the process, the privatization and liberalization of the electricity
sector, together with the capitalization rules, occurred in accordance with then-existing rules
and commitments; and an international investor (later setting up a SPV, GAI) acquired, in
two stages, shares in EGSA. The Tribunal therefore does not deem it necessary to undertake
any particular analysis or form any conclusions regarding the period before June 1995,

except as specifically required by particular circumstances regarding discrete issues.

B. THE DATE OF THE INVESTMENTS MADE BY GAI AND RURELEC’S INDIRECT
ACQUISITION OF GAI

408. The same applies to the issue of whether the investments made by GAI were made before or
after the acquisition by Rurelec of indirect control of EGSA and the actual date of such
acquisition. The issue of the indirect acquisition by Rurelec of the controlling stake in
EGSA—as a matter of jurisdiction—has already been examined and decided. However,
irrespective of the investment being made when Rurelec was already or was not yet the
indirect owner of 50.001% of EGSA’s stock capital, the Tribunal’s conclusion remains that

said investment is protected under the relevant BIT.

C. EGSA’s FINANCIAL SITUATION PRIOR TO THE NATIONALISATION

409. The Tribunal also considers that the issue of EGSA’s dividend policy and divestments that
have provoked much debate between the Parties is immaterial to the outcome of this case.
The inflation index (UFV), EGSA’s decisions about dividends, and the respective
distributions to its shareholders—undertaken with the approval and for the benefit of
Bolivian minority shareholders as well—were made in accordance with the law and are a

normal practice for companies all over the world. The same is the case for divestment of

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 151 of 208

assets no longer considered necessary for generation by EGSA,“*° as well as the debates
surrounding EGSA’s credit rating and all the elements to confirm its accuracy. Therefore, the
Tribunal will not undertake any analysis or decisions regarding these issues, except as

specifically required by particular circumstances regarding discrete issues.

410. Much of the Parties’ efforts related to the points mentioned above are deemed irrelevant by
the Tribunal, if only because the Parties agreed that the main approach to the valuation of
EGSA (and the compensation, if any, to be paid after nationalisation) should be the FMV, as
determined on the date of the nationalisation using the DCF method, which is forward-
looking. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent (and Rurelec also appears to agree) that
this case concerns quantum." Irrespective of what may have happened before May 2010, if
a notional willing buyer (WB) would have agreed to pay a positive amount for the shares of

EGSA, compensation is due; otherwise, no compensation would be due.

4

- The Tribunal will now turn to one issue that has been the subject of much debate between the

Parties during the proceedings: EGSA’s liquidity situation prior to its nationalisation.

412. The existence in EGSA of acute liquidity problems prior to its nationalisation has been
amply demonstrated by the Respondent by means of contemporaneous evidence, including
the views expressed by EGSA’s finance director in internal communications. But the most
relevant controversy pertains to the explanation of such financial difficulties and its

relevance for the valuation of EGSA.

413.For the Respondent those liquidity problems were a clear indication of fundamental
weaknesses in EGSA’s finances which cast a dark shadow on its future, since they were, in
the Respondent’s view, one of the fundamental reasons for the delay in the implementation
of the CCGT project and exposed EGSA to the catastrophic risk of being denied access to
gas supplies. Thus, the Respondent portrays EGSA’s liquidity problems as consistent with
the negative value which PROFIN assigned to its shares immediately following its

nationalisation.

414. Rurelec, after recognizing the reality of such liquidity problems, has consistently attempted
to portray them as the result of the Respondent’s hostility towards EGSA and, more
specifically, of the change in the regulatory environment, of some bona fide measures like

“85 Tn any event the decommissioning and future sale could not occur, at least in practical terms, without the agreement of the

regulator.

the Rural Electrification Projects (Proyectos de Electrificacién Rural) and Dignity Tariff
(Tarifa Dignidad), and of Bolivia’s lack of interest in facilitating a rapid sale by EGSA of its
carbon credit rights—a transaction which, by injecting new money into the company, might

have helped the company overcome its liquidity squeeze.

415. The Tribunal rejects both the Respondent’s story of the nationalisation as the “rescue” of a
cash-strapped utility on the brink of bankruptcy and Rurelec’s story of EGSA’s liquidity
problems as the result of a “creeping expropriation” strategy pursued by the Bolivian

authorities.

416. In the Tribunal’s view, EGSA’s liquidity problems can be seen as the cumulative result of a
complex set of circumstances, which cannot be traced either to a lack of management skills
in EGSA, fundamental weaknesses in its balance sheet or business model, or deliberate

attempts by the Bolivian authorities to bring the company to its financial knees.

417. The Tribunal considers that the capital expenditures in the CCGT, the Rural Electrification
Projects, and the Dignity Tariff drained financial resources, reduced EGSA’s liquidity, and
constrained the pay-out of dividends to EGSA’s shareholders. Together with the
modification of the regulatory environment regarding capacity payments and spot prices,”
these circumstances largely explain the liquidity problems actually faced by EGSA. It is true
that, while some of those circumstances had a sudden and unexpected impact on EGSA—for
example, the reduction of capacity payments by 17% without any gradual phasing-in—
others were predictable and developed over the years, such that EGSA and its shareholders
could have anticipated them and have taken measures to prevent the ensuing liquidity

squeeze.

4

oo

- The Tribunal has not found any grounds to conclude that a lack of management skills was
the relevant reason for this liquidity problem. The CCGT project experienced cost overruns,
but this was due to an increase in generation capacity which was in the interest of Bolivia
and its consumers, and the need for additional investment obviously necessitated new
financial resources that would only be paid back later on.““* The liquidity problems might
arguably have prompted EGSA shareholders to provide EGSA with additional funding to
avoid major difficulties with its suppliers and, more particularly, with its gas supplier

“8 Tn the latter case, had the regulatory environment not been changed, the additional funds would have gone into the

Stabilization Fund and, therefore, would not have created a positive cash flow in time (Rejoinder on the Merits, 4371). This
would nonetheless have had a positive impact on the economic fundamentals of EGSA, thereby increasing its capacity to
obtain third party funding.

488 Mr Earl and Mr Lanza expected that, once in operation, the CCGT would double the EGSA EBIDTA (see, for instance,
Earl’s Cross-Examination, Transcript (English), Day 1, 2 April 2013, 25:20-25:22).

PCA Case No. 2011-17

Page 153 of 208

(YPFB). However, no evidence has been provided that the gas supplier was considering, let
alone had decided upon, charging interest, cancelling the supply of gas, or instituting legal

proceedings in order to obtain payment on the outstanding invoices.

419. No evidence has been provided that a prospective buyer would not also have benefitted from
that situation of coerced supplier-financing, particularly bearing in mind that the gas supplier
had, at that time, a production surplus and was not able to export any more than it already
was. Moreover, no reason would have existed to refuse to the prospective buyer what had

been tolerated to EGSA.

420. Rurelec notably refers to justify the liquidity problems, to the fact it did not have access to
the carbon credits before the nationalisation as a result of the Respondent’s attitude and lack
of cooperation in getting the United Nations’ clearance. The Tribunal disagrees with
Rurelec. This situation was not materially due to the acts or omissions of Bolivia,“ which

did not have any responsibility in this respect.

421.Evidence has been provided that the CCGT project was near completion in May 2010

(95.1%), such that it was clearly feasible to start production later that year.”'

Thus, delays
in the implementation of the project were limited and it is not necessary for the Tribunal to
ascertain in detail to what extent they were caused by EGSA’s liquidity constraints or the
relatively long time required to obtain the necessary authorizations from the Municipality of

Santa Cruz and Bolivia’s regulatory authorities.

422. In conclusion, as indicated above, EGSA’s liquidity problems resulted from a complex set of
circumstances and were neither the result of fundamental weaknesses in the company’s
balance sheet, business model, or economic prospects, nor of a deliberate attempt by the
Bolivian authorities to prepare its subsequent nationalisation. Yet, in the Tribunal’s view,
EGSA’s liquidity problems, even if arguably of a short-term nature, are not totally
immaterial to EGSA’s valuation, since they could influence to a certain extent the risk
perception of a WB and affected, at least marginally, the discount factor or WACC applied

in its valuation.

4® Although it is true that some delays could have been avoided in the licensing phase, the main reasons for the lack of

credits before nationalisation were not related to these delays, but to the complexity of the process.

D. THE REGULATORY MODIFICATIONS, ALLEGED CREEPING EXPROPRIATION,
AND THE DIGNITY TARIFF

423. It is still necessary to examine the issue of the potential effects of modifications of capacity
payments and spot prices on the FMV of EGSA as at the date of nationalisation as well as
certain other events which transpired in the years leading up to May 2010. Having already
decided that it has no jurisdiction over the so-called “New Claims”, the Tribunal will refrain
from dealing with any alleged BIT violations concerning the modification of spot price or
capacity payments in their own right. The Tribunal may nevertheless take these measures
into account to the extent that they could be construed, as alleged by Rurelec, as the initial
steps of a “creeping expropriation”. Despite acknowledging that these measures had a very
strong impact on the liquidity and/or the accounts of EGSA, however, the Tribunal
concludes that it has not been demonstrated that these measures formed part of a creeping
expropriation or a discriminatory one, even if it is clear that Bolivia was fully aware that

such regulatory decisions would affect EGSA’s and other energy companies’ market values.

424. It is undisputed that the 1994 Electricity Law constitutes the framework to be taken into
account in defining the rights of international investors in the electricity sector, notably the
principles of efficiency, transparency, quality, continuity, adaptability, and neutrality. At the
time of nationalisation, ROME 1995 (specifically Article 63 thereof) was the applicable rule
and it had been amended more than once,*” for instance by ROME 2001 (Supreme Decree
26,093, in particular Article 67 thereof). One of the modifications consisted of disregarding,

in the calculation of the marginal cost, the so-called forced supply (“generacién forzada” or

2493

“despacho forzado””) and the cold reserve (“reserva fria”) which was remunerated at 50%

of PBP until the reserve of the system reaches 17.5%.""*

425. Stability and predictability are values generally applicable to tariffs. But that does not and
cannot preclude modifications, which modifications, to the Tribunal’s knowledge, EGSA did
not in fact react to in any way until the last one (in 2008). The price-setting mechanisms
established for the electricity sector in each period were no more than possibilities and
clearly did not form part of the programme proposed to investors as a condition for

investment (the so-called “stable and predictable regulatory framework”), even if Bolivia

accepted, notably in the “Sector Policy Letter”,“”’ that tariffs would “reflect the economic

and financial supply costs”.

426. In addition, the modifications did not constitute “the setting of prices that do not remunerate

the investment made nor allow reasonable profit to be gained”, nor was this their intent.”°
The changes in fact still allowed for reasonable profit to the point that even dividends were
possible. Therefore, after reviewing the relevant documents and witness testimony regarding
this matter, the Tribunal does not consider that Bolivia acted, in relation to the capacity
payment and the method for calculation of the spot price, in a way that, from a global
viewpoint, violated this rule: investment returns remained, reasonable profits were obtained,
and “economic and financial supply costs” were covered. The Tribunal is also not convinced
that GAI’s investment—in relation to Bolivia—relied on that previous regulatory

” the Tribunal is not

environment. Consequently, and contrary to Rurelec’s assertion,*”
persuaded that the regulatory changes formed part of a scheme leading up to the

nationalisation of EGSA.

427. Moreover, to reach this conclusion, the Tribunal does not need to enter into the question of
the independence (or lack thereof) of the decision-maker, CNDC.* It is clear that
regulators, even when formally independent, are close to governments and do not usually act
in a way that is unnecessarily detrimental to national strategies, but rather act in the opposite

fashion.

428. In particular, with respect to the capacity payments, evidence has been provided that the
capacity price increase of 20% constituted compensation for additional costs related to a
special situation arising in 2001.” Therefore, there was no justification for this measure to
be maintained any longer—and especially to be maintained, not as compensation for costs,

but rather as a guarantee of reasonable profits/returns—after these conditions had changed,

as had in fact occurred prior to 2007 when Resolution SSDE 040 eliminated the

complementary 20% equipment head.

429. The Tribunal is also not convinced that the exclusion of the marginal liquid fuel units in the

calculation of the spot prices up to 2008 was arbitrary or unreasonable or jeopardized the

500

economic viability of EGSA.”” As such, the 2008 modification did not affect said viability.

The Tribunal does not agree with Rurelec.%' Even though consumers were financially

protected under Supreme Decree 27302 (stabilization of tariffs through a Stabilization Fund

502

to the benefit of end users”), the fact is that sooner or later this excessive burden would fall

on the general public.”

430. Furthermore, while evidence has been provided that CNDC did not allow the older units to

be decommissioned™ (EGSA was “forced to retain” them, in Rurelec’s words™), the

simple fact that decommissioning was requested is

 

strong evidence that these units were not
essential to EGSA’s profitability. The argument thus seems to backfire against Rurelec.
However, even if decommissioning had not been requested by EGSA, the Tribunal considers
that no justification exists to consider the measures regarding spot prices to be unjust per se,

let alone part of a creeping expropriation scheme.
06

Such framework, defined in the 1994 Electricity Law, referred to the “costo marginal del
sistema” (Article 45), to be determined by CNDC, and to the “precios de nodo” as “costos
marginales de corto plazo de energia del sistema” (Article 49), to be determined by
Superintendencia de Electricidad.” To prevent Bolivia from introducing non-arbitrary
technical adjustments in the definition of the electricity system’s marginal cost would be an
excessive limitation of Bolivia’s rights, especially when it has not been shown that such

regulatory changes formed part of a nationalisation scheme.”

432. In any event, as calculated by the two expert witnesses, and irrespective of the differences
between them, the marginal discount value associated with the spot price modification was
minimal.*” The legality or illegality of the measure is therefore a matter of national
administrative law and the Tribunal will not take it into consideration in the determining the

FMV of EGSA.*”

433. As for the Dignity Tariff (2006), this was clearly accepted by EGSA and its shareholders as a
way of increasing goodwill through social responsibility and cooperation, and thereby
averting or forestalling any nationalisation. It is also undisputed that, since at least 2006," if

not 2005,°” nationalisation was on the political agenda.

434. However, the Dignity Tariff agreement cannot be construed as a safety net against future
changes. Article 5 is a best efforts clause (“agotar esfuerzos”) and not an abdication of
Bolivia’s right to modify the pricing system. Nor did it expand from a legal point of view the
investment protection already in existence. In fact, “ensuring that [electricity sector
companies’] income allows them to ensure the sustainability and reliability of supply” (C-
119, Article 5) means what it says and nothing more. No explicit legal commitment against
modifications was made, except to the extent of endeavouring to ensure that such

modifications would not affect the supply of electricity.

435. As to quantum, the Tribunal considers, therefore, that such value ought to be calculated
“taking into account all the existing regulations in place (or expected) as of May 1, 2010” °\*
This is not only because of the Tribunal’s declared lack of jurisdiction over the so-called

“New Claims”, but also on the grounds that, in the Tribunal’s view:

(a) The 2007 decision to remove the 20% additional cost, added for the purpose of
calculating capacity payments, was not arbitrary or discriminatory and had been taken
on the basis of adequate professional advice. Thus, there is no reason for a WB to

consider it likely that such decision might have been reverted in the future.

system’s “marginal price”, of the exceptionally high price of the energy produced by
diesel fuel units—was not arbitrary or discriminatory, or part of a strategy of rampant or
creeping expropriation. Thus, in estimating the value of EGSA the Tribunal will assume

that said Resolution remained in force throughout the life of the project.

E. THE ILLEGALITY OF THE EXPROPRIATION

436. The right to expropriate is a sovereign right recognized by international law, subject to
certain conditions. Both Parties agree with that statement, which is uncontroversial. Legality
at the international level, and under Article 5(1) of the UK-Bolivia BIT, is dependent upon
the existence of a “public purpose” and the payment at the time of the expropriation of “just

and effective compensation”.

437. If the expropriation had not been made “for a public purpose and for a social benefit related
to the internal needs of that Party” it would have then been illegal per se. However, the
precise contours of public purpose and social benefit lie with the internal constitutional and
legal order of the State in question, and in this case the conditions are evidently met,*'* and

are not disputed between the Parties.

438. As for “just and effective compensation”, Bolivia decided that the value of the assets was
less than zero and, therefore, no compensation was due. Had this been true, the expropriation
would have been legal. This Tribunal, after an adversarial process with the benefit of very
professional advocacy and expert testimony, has concluded, however, that EGSA had a
positive value, as explained further below. However, irrespective of Bolivia’s failure to
properly assess and understand why and how EGSA did not have a negative value, the facts
presented by Rurelec were insufficient to convince the Tribunal that Bolivia acted wilfully
and intentionally to obtain an expert valuation setting forth such negative value for EGSA.°"°

439.Rurelec also alleged that the expropriation was illegal because the Respondent has not
complied with its obligation to provide due process of law by refusing to allow Rurelec to
participate in the valuation process to assess the fair value of compensation.*'® The Tribunal
does not agree. As opposed to the US-Bolivia BIT, which prohibits expropriation “except

[...] in accordance with due process of law”, the UK-Bolivia BIT does not explicitly

that the conduct of Bolivia was wilful—see Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief, {5.

Page 159 of 208

establish due process as a precondition for the expropriation of an investment. Moreover, the
Tribunal considers that Article 5(1) of the UK-Bolivia BIT, which states that “[t]he national
or company affected shall have the right to establish promptly by due process of law in the
territory of the contracting party making the expropriation, the legality of the expropriation
and the amount of the compensation in accordance with the principle set out in this
paragraph’, does not impose upon the expropriating State an obligation to assess the value
of compensation through a process in which the expropriated national or company must
necessarily participate. Further, the Tribunal also does not consider it possible to derive from

the cases cited by Rurelec*””

(which, moreover, concern radically different facts than the
present case) the existence of a rule of customary international law obliging expropriating
States to grant to the expropriated national or company a right to participate in such

valuation process.

440. Rather, the investor’s recourse, if it disputes the valuation performed by the expropriating
State, is to seek review through procedures made available in that State’s internal law in
accordance with Article 5(1) or to submit the matter to international arbitration in accordance
with Article 8. However, no evidence has been provided that the internal expropriation
procedure was illegal per se under Bolivian law, and Rurelec itself did not seek the

annulment of the expropriation.

441. The issue of illegality is thus mostly objective: if EGSA had a positive value, Bolivia should
have indemnified Rurelec, providing just and effective compensation, since any State which
carries out an expropriation is expected to accurately and professionally assess the true value
of the expropriated assets. Bolivia did not actually compensate (or intend to compensate)
Rurelec as it did not make an accurate assessment of EGSA’s value at the time. In fact, it did
quite the opposite, and if the Tribunal finds the valuation to be “manifestly inadequate”, this

is Bolivi:

 

’s responsibility. As will be explained further below, this is in fact the case and the

expropriation was therefore illegal
442.The Respondent does not appear to disagree: the heading of chapter 2.4.2°" of the

compensation was due in the present case” (“La Nacionalizacién no fue illegal porque en el

presente caso ninguna compensacién era debida”). Therefore, given the Tribunal’s decision
that compensation was indeed due, the nationalisation must be illegal with respect to the

requirement of compensation.

443. As the Respondent acknowledges,” both sides agree on the principle to be used for the
calculation of the value of EGSA: FMV as assessed using the DCF method in accordance
with the WBS. Given the above, the standard of compensation does not seem to differ
whether the expropriation is deemed legal or not. The Parties do not appear to differ on this

point either.*”!

444. International investment arbitration is often the land of ideological confrontation and moral
judgments. However, this Tribunal considers that it should restrict itself to ruling on the
relief sought and, as such, to pass directly to the quantum part of this Award, to assess
regardless of whether EGSA had a positive value at the date of the nationalisation. Since the
Tribunal concludes below that this was the case, “just and effective compensation” should
have been paid, along with interest on such value accruing from the date of the

nationalisation at an appropriate rate to be determined by this Tribunal.

F. ALTERNATIVE VALUATION METHODS

445. As to quantum, both sides agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that the main principle guiding
the determination of the value of EGSA should be FMV as assessed using the DCF method
in accordance with the WBS. Rurelec has, however, drawn the Tribunal’s attention to two
alternative valuation methods—Book Value (BV) and EBIDTA multiple comparables—as
benchmarks for its valuation and to demonstrate that the result of their DCF calculations
were reasonable, while the Respondent’s were not. Furthermore, during the arbitration
proceedings an additional benchmark indirectly came up: the actual price paid for EGSA’s
shares in its 2003 purchase by IEL—where the seller, First Energy, sold at a price well
below book value—and, subsequently, in its indirect purchase by Rurelec in 2006, which
paid USD 35 million. Since the Tribunal believes that those alternative benchmarks have
very limited value, it will just highlight below the main claims made by the Parties, before
embarking in a far more detailed, substantive analysis of the main valuation method agreed

by the Parties and the Tribunal, i.e. the DCF method.

446. In its first expert report, Compass Lexecon excluded other alternative valuation methods (net
capital contribution, comparable transactions, etc.), but benchmarked its DCF valuation of
EGSA against its Enterprise Value (EV)/EBITDA ratio. In order to do so it estimated at 9.74
the median value of such multiple, as of April 30, 2010 for a sample of 30 comparable
electric companies in emerging economies. It further estimated at USD 24.5 million EGSA’s
EBITDA in 2011, the first complete year with the CCGT in operation, which resulted in an
EV for EGSA of USD 238.6 million, which, after subtracting its debt, worked out to some
USD 73 million for Rurelec’s 50.001 stake in EGSA.°”

447.Econ One criticized such valuation on several counts: the market multiple comparables
approach is only applicable to firms with an unlimited time-horizon, rather than EGSA’s 28-
year horizon; the sample selected by Econ One was not fully comparable to EGSA; no
allowance had been made for EGSA’s huge outstanding commercial arrears; and, last but not
least, the right EBITDA to use was the one obtained in 2009, not the expected one in
2011,

448. In its rebuttal report, Compass Lexecon addressed at length those criticisms and offered an
additional alternative benchmark, namely EGSA’s book value, which according to its 2009
financial statements—the last audited annual report before its nationalisation—amounted to
USD 133 million, i.e. some USD 66 million for Rurelec’s 50.001% stake. It stressed that
Econ One’s zero DCF valuation implied a price to book value ratio of zero, a result both
surprising in a company such as EGSA with a solid history and prospects of profitability and

at odds with the typical ratios for other traded companies.”

449. In its rejoinder report, Econ One not only responded to Compass Lexecon’s arguments on
market multiples, but discussed at length EGSA’s book value. It recalled that, in past
transactions, EGSA’s shares had always been sold at a discount on book value: in 2003, First
Energy had taken a USD 33 million book loss and in 2006 IEL had reportedly sold EGSA to

Rurelec with a discount of 20% on book value”.

450.In the Respondent’s view, EGSA’s book value had become increasingly detached from its
market value as a result of two new accounting policies introduced in 2007 and 2009. First,

starting in 2007, EGSA had applied a new accounting rule in Bolivia requiring the price of

assets to be indexed to a domestic inflation index (the so-called “Unidad de Fomento de
Vivienda” or “UFV”). To the extent that during those years the Bolivian peso had strongly
appreciated in real terms vis-a-vis the US dollar—because the dollar had depreciated in
nominal terms vis-a-vis the peso, while Bolivia had experienced significant inflation—the
book value of EGSA’s turbines was now overvalued (in dollar terms), thereby artificially
inflating not only the company’s net equity (expressed in dollar terms), but also its reported
profits. Secondly, starting in 2009, EGSA had started to capitalize (i.e. amortize over some
years) maintenance costs which until then had been classified as current operational

expenditures.

. Even if a significant part of the hearing was devoted to further discussions on the alternative
valuation methods issues described above, there is no need for further elaboration here since
they do not have any bearing on the Parties’ and the Tribunal’s method of choice for

evaluating EGSA: the DCF method, to which we now turn.

G. THE APPROACH TO DAMAGES

452. As previously stated, this Tribunal agrees with the Parties that this case is mostly about
quantum. This Award now arrives at the part of the case that is the most relevant and clearly
the most difficult to resolve, even if the Tribunal’s work has been made substantially easier
by the quality of the advocacy and of the experts’ reports and authorities which were

provided.

453.The Parties are in agreement on several relevant points, which are also accepted by the

Tribunal. They include the following:
(a) The 2010-2038 timeframe for the analysis;

(b

FMV as the standard for defining compensation, if any;

(c) FMV to be determined, by reference to the WBS” as at the date of the nationalisation,
by the DCF method;

(CAPEX), taxes and discount rate”*** (albeit that the Parties do not agree on the actual

figures and the grounds for them);

(e) The use of the WACC™” as the appropriate discount rate;

(f) The cost of debt to be used in the calculation of the WACC; and

(g) A “standard of proof’, that assumes that assessing values for compensation is not an
exact science, rather than “an exercise in certainty [...] an exercise in sufficient
aye? 5
certainty”?

454.In spite of the general agreements described above, the Parties differ (based on the expert
reports submitted) on the specifics of some underlying assumptions,’ mostly in relation to
revenue projections, CAPEX, and the discount rate,” the other differences between them
being irrelevant or agreed by the experts following their discussions and cross-examination.

These differences must be addressed in detail by the Tribunal.

455.In relation to revenues, the Parties disagree as to the projections for capacity and energy
dispatch and capacity price forecasts. In relation to the discount rate, they disagree about the
optimal capital/debt ratio, the country risk premium and its multiplier, and the size premium.
These discrepancies create a huge difference in the WACC to be used to determine the
discount rate (10.63% vs. 19.85%) and it is therefore the major reason for their differing

conclusions concerning compensation.

H. REVENUE SIDE

456. To estimate EGSA’s expected revenue during the 2010-2038 period, it is necessary to make
a number of assumptions.” The revenue is mostly produced by three streams: sale of
energy, capacity payments and carbon credits. Only the first two are subject to disagreement

between the Parties.“
457. The projected sale of energy is, in turn, the result of two factors:

- the price per kWh of electricity produced by each production unit; and

- the amount of energy dispatched by each production unit.

458.Both factors are dependent upon the projected demand for electricity and the supply

available in the market during the years 2010-2038.

459. The optimal scenario for each of the Parties would be either higher demand and lower supply
or lower demand and higher supply, respectively, as this would slant profitability towards the

position of each side.

460. In order to estimate those variables, both Parties agree with the use of the “Stochastic Dual
Dynamic Programming” (SDDP), used by CNDC to simulate the future evolution of various
factors that influence energy demand and supply, and mathematically determine the optimal
distribution of energy dispatched from the various units in the system and the system’s

marginal cost of production, as defined by the applicable regulations.

461. The use of the SDDP is not at issue between the Parties, although they are in disagreement

on the evolution of two key variables during the period 2010-2038:

- the evolution of electricity demand; and

- the evolution of investments in new capacity.

462. As expected, the Parties tend to look to the future with different eyes. Rurelec sees a bright
future for the revenue streams, a depressed future for new investments, and therefore higher

profitability for the installed units of production. The Respondent sees the opposite: a lower

5 Compass Lexecon Rebuttal Report, [106 et seq. These assumptions, which relate to future needs for energy and the actual
structure of production, provide a huge variety of results. It is therefore necessary to select which one to retain, See Llarens’
Cross-Examination, Transcript (English), Day 5, 8 April 2013, 1019-1022.

5 Tn relation to Carbon credits (Compass Lexecon Report, {83 and Econ One Report, 29) both experts calculate the sales
value of the credits the same way. However, Compass Lexecon did not initially deduct the 30% that should revert to Bolivia
in the first report. See the explanations and corrections of Dr Abdala (Abdala’s Cross-Examination, Transcript (English), Day
5,8 April 2013, 1188).

Page 165 of 208

revenue stream for EGSA, a bright future for new investments, and therefore a lower
profitability for EGSA. The Parties’ perspectives are a very important aspect of due process,
as they provide the Tribunal with contrasting views which make it easier for the Tribunal to
look at the facts with independent and impartial eyes and to see what the most likely

outcome actually is.

463. One important assumption in this kind of valuation is the WB’s attitude regarding the future.
Since the WB assumes that all the relevant entities will act rationally, it will anticipate that:
(i) the supervisory and regulatory bodies from Bolivia will do their utmost to prevent
significant electricity shortages; and (ii) GDP increases will entail an increase in electricity

demand.

464. This being the case, a WB would regard as highly improbable that Bolivia’s GDP will grow
and entail additional needs for electricity but that no new investments would take place to
meet those needs. The opposite would also be true: if GDP does not increase and the demand

for electricity stagnates, no impetus would exist for significant new investments.

465. Another important aspect of the WB is even more evident: a prospective rational buyer will
try to obtain the maximum available information with which to make a decision and, in
particular, will do adequate due diligence rather than following a passive approach that just

looks at official documents projecting the future. A WB tries to collect all the information

market information’»” and “technical studies” is part of the expected standard efforts of a

WB.*” As Rurelec stated’, both experts agreed that “all information available to the
market as of the valuation date should be taken into account”.*” This may include, but is not
be limited to, CNDC information: it will also encompass any other information resulting

from the buyer’s due diligence.

466. The Respondent argues, however, that Rurelec makes selective use of information and that
Compass Lexecon “cherry picked’ what it deemed helpful for its report from post-

nationalisation publicly available information, while disregarding what was unhelpful.”

467. In the Tribunal’s view, a WB would have used all the information available at the time of
nationalisation, irrespective of whether: (i) it was already in the public domain or was just
the result of the buyer’s own due diligence; and (ii) it resulted in a higher or lower valuation

of EGSA.

468.The Respondent’s argument regarding the selective use of available information, “cherry
picking”, and use of hindsight is a different issue. The Tribunal would obviously disagree
with a biased use of non-official information available at the nationalisation date. Nor would
the Tribunal accept that information which was not available at the date of the
nationalisation, even when a proper due diligence was carried out, could be used in
determining the FMV. However, the Tribunal would also disagree with the idea that only
official information available at that date could be considered relevant, regardless of the
possibility that such information might have been deemed inaccurate or that new facts had
already clearly arisen and would therefore have been known to the WB. Thus, the Tribunal’ s
task is to act as if it were the WB and to determine, on the basis of available evidence as to
facts and likely future events, and exercising judgment and a sense of proportionality, the
relevant information which, as of the date of the nationalisation, such WB would have likely

taken into account in estimating EGSA’s FMV.
1. Electricity demand

469. For the forecast of the electricity demand, Rurelec drew on two documents: (i) the “Informe
de la Programacién de Mediano Plazo” (PMP) covering the period between November 2009
and October 2013 and published by CNDC in September 2009, in order to estimate the
demand for electricity in 2010; and (ii) CNDC’s “Proyeccién de la demanda de energia
eléctrica de largo plazo del SIN 2011/2021” for projections of demand in subsequent years.
This latter report specifically envisaged that the Tarija and Chaco sub-systems would
become part of the Interconnected National System (SIN), thereby increasing the demand for

electricity in 2012. Rurelec’s resulting estimates of electricity demand were as follows:™!

470. The Respondent argues that, on March 15, 2010 (i.e. before the nationalisation), CNDC had
already published its new PMP, so that the one used by Rurelec was already outdated.*” It
further claims that the CNDC’s report “Proyeccién de la demanda de energia eléctrica de
largo plazo del SIN 2011/2021” used by Rurelec was not published until July 2011.
Consequently, it would not have been available as of the nationalisation date. The
Respondent also notes that, in said report, CNDC made its highest projections ever for the

demand of electricity.

47

- The Respondent instead relies on the figures in the March 15, 2010 PMP report for the
period from May 2010 to April 2014. After April 2014—albeit without saying so

explicitly—the Respondent seems to project a 5% annual growth in electricity demand.

472. In response to the Respondent’s criticisms, Rurelec’s expert points out that he used the last
PMP of September 2009 for his projections, rather than the PMP published in March 2010,
because the latter did not contain enough operating information on the January-April 2010
period, as would be necessary to produce a complete electricity production forecast from
January 2010 to December 2018. He adds that, if he had used the March 2010 PMP report,

the amount of the compensation requested would have dropped by only USD 0.2 million.**

473.Rurelec’s expert also points out that he made an inadvertent error in his first expert report
regarding the source of electricity demand in the long term projections. MEC, the consulting
firm used by Compass Lexecon, did not actually use the CNDC study “Proyeccién de la
demanda de electricidad de largo plazo del SIN 2011/2021”, but rather the electricity
demand projections set forth in the 2010 POES. He points out that the use of this latter
source is particularly appropriate, because the POES projects both expected demand and
capacity increases for the generation system. The POES demand forecasts also took into

account the new power demand arising from the Huanuni and Karachipampa mining

*® First Witness Statement of Paz, {9196-97

Page 168 of 208

projects, which were expected to start operations in 2012. Following that period of
exceptional growth, subsequent inter-annual demand growth rates slowed, gradually

decreasing to 5.9% in 2018.

474. Rurelec’s expert likewise criticises the underlying assumption of 5% growth in electricity
demand in Bolivia used in the Respondent’s forecasts, since it is not consistent with the
increase in generation units forecasted by the CNDC in the 2009 POES, the report which the

Respondent itself uses for its long-term supply forecasts.

475. The Tribunal finds that Rurelec’s demand forecast is reasonable in light of all the evidence
provided as well as the Respondent’s general optimism as to the future of emerging countries
in general, and in particular Bolivia itself. This is confirmed by the fact that Rurelec’s
forecast is based on the POES 2011-2021, prepared by CNDC and publicly available by the
end of 2010.“ This forecast takes into account not only the normal expected evolution of
Bolivia’s GDP and its relation with electricity demand, but also some “special events”,
notably the huge Karachipampa and Huanuni mining projects and the incorporation into the

SIN of the Chaco, Trinidad and Tarija systems, among other developments.

476. It is true that the 2011-2021 POES was released in December 2010, i.e. several months after
EGSA’s nationalisation. However, in the Tribunal’s view, this slight difference does not
mean that the use of such information constitutes an undue resort to hindsight (a
methodological defect to which the Respondent made repeated references during the witness

and expert examinations, and rightly so):

(a) The information contained in the POES was not confidential, nor was it subject to a
special duty of secrecy which would have made it unlikely to be disclosed prior to its

release by the CNDC.

(b

As with other CNDC reports, there was, logically, a certain delay between the time the
data on which the POES is based was collected and became known, and the publication

of the POES itself.

(c) A prospective buyer of EGSA would have had a clear financial incentive to obtain the
most updated information possible on the variables that could influence the demand for

and price of electricity in Bolivia and, as such, Rurelec’s assertion that it already had at

4 First Witness Statement of Paz, Annex 39 (CNDC, “Plan Optimo del Sistema de Interconectado Nacional, 2011-2021,
Diciembre 2010”), p. 32.

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 169 of 208

its disposal in May 2010 information similar to that published by the CNDC in

December of that same year is plausible.

477. The electricity demand growth forecasts used by the Respondent, and included in Mr Paz’s
witness statement, are not fully consistent with the 2010-2020 POES that the CNDC
published in November 2009. The forecasts included in that POES are, as the Respondent
points out, lower than those of the POES published in December 2010. For instance, in 2018
it forecasts an aggregate demand of 9,963 GWh, as compared to 11,256 GWh in the
aforementioned December 2010 POES. However, this is due to the fact that—as the report
explains in its paragraph 4.2—it merely extrapolates from the historic relation between the
GDP and electricity demand, and takes “‘megaprojects” into account only as a determining
factor for GDP growth, but not as a factor leading to specific increases in electricity demand.
Even so, the POES published in November 2009 forecasted, for the 2015-2018 period, inter-
annual electricity demand increase rates of 7.5% (2015), 6.8% (2016), 7.3% (2017), and
7.3% (2018), values significantly higher than those tacitly assumed in the Respondent’s

projections.

478. In short, the Tribunal does not find merit in the Respondent’s objections to the electricity
demand growth projections used by Rurelec, and it accepts such projections as the basis for

EGSA’s valuation.
2. Electricity supply

479. As already explained, in the Tribunal’s view a WB would have used a consistent approach: a
bullish view of Bolivia’s economic future would have translated into an assumption of both
high demand for electricity and significant new investments in capacity. Conversely, a more
pessimistic view of Bolivia’s future would have translated into expectations of both a more
subdued demand for electricity and sluggish investment in new capacity. Thus, the Tribunal
rejects as inconsistent both Rurelec’s high demand/low supply scenario and the

Respondent’s low demand/high supply scenario.

480.In its analysis of the demand for electricity, the Tribunal has accepted as reasonable
Rurelec’s scenario of a buoyant growth for Bolivia, which entailed a sustained increase in
the demand for electricity. Consequently, it should apply now a consistent view of supply
decisions and new investments and, more specifically, of the expectations that a WB would

have been likely to hold regarding the future of Karachipampa, the prospects for the

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 170 of 208

construction of the Rositas hydroelectric dam, and the future of the ARJ 1 to 3 units of

Sucre’s plant.

481. When estimating the future supply of electricity, Rurelec started out from CNDC’s POES
2011-2021, published in December 2010, but introduced two changes:

(a) It pushed back the date when EGSA’s new combined cycle came on stream to
November 2010, since such delay had already been foreseen by EGSA before its

nationalisation, even if it was not reflected in the POES forecast.

(b) It dismissed the POES forecast that the Rositas dam would commence operations in

2018.

482. Rurelec’s expert used the POES published in December 2010, rather than the one published
in November 2009, because he considered that the information set forth in the latter was
outdated. He supports that assertion on the basis that the November 2009 POES forecasted
the coming into operation between December 2009 and May 2010 of five new thermal
units—four in the Entre Rios plant in Cochabamba, and EGSA’s combined cycle in Santa
Cruz—which were actually several months delayed in commencing operations. He holds that
a rational buyer would not have relied on the information set forth in that version of the
POES and would have instead gathered more recent information similar to that subsequently

published in the December 2010 POES.

483.Rurelec argues that the Rositas power plant is a huge project that has been studied and

analysed for more than 40 years.* While it recognizes that the 2010-20 POES considered

that Rositas would be built and be in operation by January 2018,™ it points out that none of

the money budgeted for the project in 2010 had been spent in the first four months of the

7

year,’ and that CNDC had regularly included Rositas in its projections even if initial

investments and studies required to start the project had never materialized.™* The huge size
of the project and these historical precedents lead Rurelec and Compass Lexecon to consider

it highly improbable, if not impossible, that Rositas would come on stream by 2018.°”

484. The Respondent and Mr Paz assert the opposite and, therefore, include the Rositas power

plant in the projections as a unit able to dispatch.

485.The Tribunal considers that the size of an investment is certainly an important issue: it is
easier to bet on a brighter future for new investments when the amounts needed are smaller
than when they are more substantial. However, a rational decision is based upon general
optimism or pessimism regarding the future. If the dominant attitude is negative, investment
is less probable than if the trend is the opposite. The Tribunal tends to agree with Rurelec: in
May 2010, without taking into account the nationalisation of EGSA, a WB having done the
necessary due diligence would have harboured optimism regarding the future and, therefore,
would have expected demand to increase in the coming years, as anticipated by the Compass

Lexecon report based upon MEC’s projections.

486. A rational and consistent WB having done the necessary due diligence would had also been

optimistic regarding the near future for emerging economies*”

(China’s investment in
energy-related companies in particular is a good example). Therefore, such WB would have
anticipated that the necessary funding for Rositas would materialize, if not in accordance
with the POES 2010-20’s timetable, then not much later. This conclusion is reinforced by the
fact that the POES emphasized the risk of potential electricity shortages if Rositas was not
available by 2019 and was actively considering the possibility of building it initially on a
smaller scale,*' to be subsequently enlarged, say in 2019/2020.*” For these reasons, the
Tribunal will assume that Rositas would have been built by 2018 and become operational at

the beginning of 2019.°

487. By the same token, a WB with bullish views on Bolivia’s economic future and having done

the necessary due diligence would have considered it unlikely that Karachipampa would be

If Rositas commenced production in 2018, the value of the damages, in accordance with Compass Lexecon’s valuation,
would be USD 900,000 (Abda Examination, Transcript (English), Day 5, 8 April 2013, 1079). This figure has not
been subject to any comment from Mr Flores or the Respondent.

authorization in January 2010 to shut it down””’ because, as stated by Messrs Aliaga and

Andrade, EGSA was not making money from it.*” However, this would not have been the

first time that CNDC refused or postponed a decommissioning request. Indeed, Bolivian

 

regulatory bodies had shown in the past a very conservative and prudent approach towards
the electricity supply, as there was a strong risk of shortages** and in a number of similar
cases CNDC had postponed or refused requests for decommissioning.” This trend is still
true: even if such could not have been known by a WB in 2010, Karachipampa remains
available for dispatch today. Thus, the Tribunal agrees with Rurelec that Karachipampa must

be included in the dispatch calculations.”

488.In conclusion, the scenarios on Rositas and Karachipampa are closely linked, since a WB

with optimistic views on Bolivia’s demand for electricity would have expected both that the
former would be built according to schedule and the latter would not be decommissioned

until Rositas came on stream.

3. Price of Electricity

489. Differences between the Parties as to their respective expectations of the growth of demand

for electricity and the increase in generation units result in differences regarding the two
main factors which make up EGSA’s revenues from electricity sales: (i) the unit price per
MWh produced and (ii) the total physical amount of electricity dispatched to the SIN by
EGSA’s units.

490. The differences between electricity prices forecasted by Rurelec and by the Respondent are

relevant, as illustrated in the following figure:

491. As can be observed in the above figure, Rurelec forecasts a slight initial decline in the price
of electricity, with nominal prices ranging from USD 16.6 to USD 18.4 for the various nodes
as of 2018. From 2018 onwards, Rurelec anticipates that the price will be stable in real

terms, and thus adjusts it in nominal terms using the expected US PPI.

492.The Respondent argues otherwise and anticipates a lower nominal price for the coming

years.

493. Those differences are completely aside from the Parties’ differences regarding Resolution
SSDE No. 283/08, which excluded units using liquid fuel for the determination of the
system’s marginal cost, since Rurelec made a clean separation between its expropriation and
“spot price” claims, and assumed for the former calculations that Resolution SSDE NO

283/08 remained in force.

494. The Tribunal in this case is therefore more convinced by Rurelec’s forecast as to electricity
prices. However, given that Rositas shall be assumed to enter into production in 2019, it is
necessary to adjust the forecasts accordingly, not only as to EGSA’s electricity dispatch, but

also in relation to the price for electricity from 2019 onwards.

495. Even if Rurelec assumed in its own calculations that the Rositas dam would never be built,
they estimated in exhibit C-359 the consequences of assuming that it was built and became
operational as of 2018. To the extent that document C-359 includes both the physical amount
of electricity dispatched by EGSA in 2018—i.e. assuming Rositas was already in

operation—and EGSA’s revenue from energy sales that year, it allows the Tribunal, after

Award
Page 174 of 208

inferring the electricity prices that, according to Rurelec, would have prevailed in 2018

assuming that Rositas entered in operation that year, to adapt these for 2019.

496. In order to estimate electricity prices from 2019 onwards, the Tribunal has applied to the
2018 prices in exhibit C-359 the PPI inflation estimate—i.e. a cumulative 2.5% rate—used

generally by both sides to index all dollar figures after that year.

497.In summary, the Tribunal decides to accept Rurelec’s forecast of electricity prices up to
2018, and reject the Respondent’s. However, it has decided to reflect, starting in 2019, the
impact of Rositas’ entry in operation on the price of electricity. The following figure

compares the Tribunal’s forecast of electricity prices with those of the Parties:

4. Revenues from capacity payments

498. The forecast of EGSA’s revenues for capacity payments depends on two main factors:

The prevailing unit price in each period for every kW of installed capacity with a right
to payment (“capacity price”); and
- The aggregate capacity of EGSA’s units that, at each moment in time, were part of the

“firm capacity” and were consequently entitled to payment.
(i) Capacity Prices (“Precio Basico por Potencia”)

499. The capacity price (PBP) is, as already discussed above, the payment obtained by generators
for putting their generation capacity at the system’s disposal, regardless of whether they

actually dispatch energy or not, provided that the corresponding unit forms part of the so-

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 175 of 208

called “firm capacity” and has not been relegated because of its economic inefficiency to the

category of “cold reserve”.

500. PBP has been forecast by the Parties in the same way and with similar reasoning as for spot
prices. For different reasons, the Parties made their calculation based on the rules in force in
May 2010 and, therefore, without using the 20% increase that had been cancelled by the
Norma Operativa N° 19/2007 (Resolucién aprobada por la SSDE N° 040).

501.This being so, the main issue between the Parties is the inflation index to be used in the
calculation of the PBP. Rurelec, based upon the reports of Compass Lexecon, uses the “US
Producer Prices Index — Turbine and Turbine Generator Set Units” (Turbine Index),** using
a reference period of 2000-10. As a consequence, Rurelec assumes that the unit price would

grow at a rate of 3.47% annually in nominal terms.

502. The Respondent, based on the reports of Econ One, prefers to use the standard US PPI—i.e.
a 2.5% annual rate—and insists that, if the Turbine Index is used, the reference period should
be a longer one (1990-2010) during which turbine prices grew at a cumulative annual rate of

only 2.27%."

503. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent. The explanations provided by Compass Lexecon
were not strong enough to eliminate the impression that the reference period that they used—
i.e. 2000-2010—was not representative of long-term trends, since it was distorted by an
exceptional increase in turbine prices in 2007-2008.** Mr Abdala accepted that the Turbine
Index used by him was high or at least that “probably [...] over the long term, there
shouldn't be that much of a difference” between the two indexes.*° In response to the
Tribunal, he was also unable to explain the logic of his assumption that the relative price of
turbines would increase for the foreseeable future, particularly since there are no specific
barriers to entry in the market for turbines which could explain that sustained trend in a

market economy.

504. The only doubt for the Tribunal was whether to accept the standard US PPI or the Turbine

Index available for a longer period. Mr Flores stated in his direct examination presentation

(Slide 9) that both experts use the Turbine Index. However, the Tribunal, faced with this
discrepancy and the challenge of selecting the appropriate period, prefers to use the standard

US PPI, and therefore will use the 2.5% value for its calculations.
(ii) Eligible installed capacity

505. Compass Lexecon assumes, from its very first expert report, that EGSA’s aggregate installed
capacity, present and future, would be entitled to capacity payments, such that they merely

multiply that aggregate capacity by the unit PBP forecasted in each period.

506. The Respondent points out, on the contrary, that EGSA’s firm capacity entitled to collect
capacity payments is lower than that indicated by Rurelec, since the latter only forecasted the
generation capacity EGSA would have had in 2012—i.e., once the combined cycle came on
stream—as if it were all firm capacity, failing to take into account that some of EGSA’s
oldest thermal units would fall out of the “firm capacity” category, and would become “cold
reserve” units not entitled to collect the PBP, as a result of the installation of new
competitive hydroelectric power plants.*” Thus, in the Respondent’s view, Rurelec has
overestimated EGSA’s firm capacity by 21 Mw in 2011, 42 Mw in 2012, 86 Mw in 2013,
and 99 Mw from 2014 onwards.** The Respondent points out that Rurelec’s expert has
clearly not conducted any simulation of the future firm capacity, but has simply used
EGSA’s whole installed capacity, including the least efficient units thereof (such as

Guaracachi 1, 2 and 6, Santa Cruz | and 2 and Aranjuez 1, 2 and 3).

507. In his third witness statement submitted by the Respondent, dated | March 2013, Engineer
Paz deemed this a serious error, especially in respect of the abovementioned three Aranjuez
units following Rositas’ entry in operation, because Rositas would be within the same circuit
as the Aranjuez plant and would displace the production of those inefficient thermal power
stations, whose production cost is two times that of the more modern turbines belonging to

EGSA itself.”

508.Rurelec rejects this counter-argument on the basis that, given the forecasted growth in
demand for electricity—ranging between 7% and 12% per year during the 2011-2018
period—the new hydroelectric power plants would have been unlikely to displace EGSA’s
5% Flores’ Direct Examination Presentation, Slides 9-14 (albeit that Slide 13 shows as “Indexacién Econ One” the standard
index that is less favourable to the Respondent than that accepted by the Tribunal).

thermal units. In addition, the need for SIN to maintain an appropriate capacity reserve

margin reinforces Rurelec’s hypothesis. In any event, Rurelec asserts that the Respondent

overestimates the new hydroelectric generation capacity.°””

509. The Tribunal, in keeping with the abovementioned principle of consistency between the
forecasted growth in demand for electricity and the expansion of installed capacity in the
SIN, considers Rurelec’s forecast until 2018 to be justified, because the strong growth in
demand is likely to force the authorities to deem all of EGSA’s generation facilities to form

part of the firm capacity.

510. However, as pointed out by the Respondent, the foreseeable entry into operation of the
Rositas power plant—that Rurelec has disregarded, but which the Tribunal considers should
be included as part of the forecasts (as of 2019)—would probably relegate EGSA’s most
inefficient units to mere “cold reserve”, in particular those of the Aranjuez plant.
Consequently, the Tribunal understands that units ARJ-1, 2, and 3 as well as the
Karachipampa power plant should be withdrawn from EGSA’s capacity revenue forecasts

for the 2019-2038 period.

5. Conclusion about Revenues

5

. As a result of the foregoing conclusions, the Tribunal has decided to introduce into Rurelec’s

forecast of EGSA’s revenues the following modifications:

(a) those resulting from a WB’s expectation that Rositas would start operating in 2019 and,

as a consequence,

- the electricity dispatched by EGSA would be reduced;

- the spot price would also be similarly reduced; and

-  EGSA’s installed capacity eligible to received capacity payments would also be
reduced.

(b) the reduction in the rate of inflation on the PBP is reduced from 3.47% to 2.5%.

512.The following figure compares the result of the Tribunal’s decisions with the Parties’

forecasts of EGSA’s revenues:

513. As a consequence, modifications have been made to Rurelec’s valuation model and the

conclusions are presented at the Excel table attached to this Award as Annex A.

I. COST SIDE

514. After looking at the revenue side, it is now time to look in detail at the cost side. The relevant

items are (i) OPEX, including cost of energy (natural gas and diesel), and (ii) CAPEX.*”!

1. OPEX

972

515. The biggest part of OPEX, by far (90%°""), is energy costs. The Parties are in agreement on
energy costs. The prices in Bolivia have been fixed since 2001 at 1.30$/Tcf for natural gas
and 0.526$/litre for diesel. The minor discrepancy between the Parties relates to what
inflation should be added: Econ One considers that prices would remain flat until 2018 and
so applied inflation only to the remaining 10% of the total costs. Compass Lexecon decided
to assume price inflation from 2010 to 2038 and so it applied the US PPI to the total amount
of costs. The PPI is accepted by Econ One, but applied only from 2019 to 2038. The
Tribunal sees no reason to apply a different approach before and after 2018 on this particular
issue, as no explanation has been given to justify doing so. Therefore, the Tribunal accepts

Rurelec’s approach.

*1 Tax has been considered as an issue, but Compass Lexecon agreed in its Rebuttal Report (Compass Lexecon Rebuttal
Report, 1140) with Econ One’s remarks (Econ One Report, $34).

516. Some differences also arise in relation to administrative costs.

Page 179 of 208

573 Tn their initial reports, both
experts projected these costs as a fixed percentage of EGSA’s revenues, drawn from figures
for the 2005-2009 period.” However, in its rebuttal report,” Compass Lexecon claimed
that it had made an error and decided instead to assume that administrative costs would
remain constant in real terms and thus grow “in nominal terms, with growth in overall
inflation”. Econ One criticized Compass’ change of criterion and noted that it increased
EGSA’s value. The Tribunal agrees, however, with Rurelec’s solution, which it regards as
more logical, since EGSA’s administrative costs were limited, and can largely be regarded as

a recurrent fixed cost, unrelated to the actual level of electricity produced.

. Other minor discrepancies between the Parties (albeit in regard to very small amounts) relate

to depreciation, namely the start date for CCGT depreciation*” and working capital.*” Here,
the Tribunal thinks that CCGT depreciation should start in November 2010 and accepts

Rurelec’s view as to working capital.

518. The Tribunal was therefore able to reach the conclusion in relation to OPEX shown in Annex

A.

2. CAPEX

519. Compass Lexecon considered that the only investment to be included for the purposes of the

cost calculation is the CCGT expansion project.°”*

CAPEX are as follows:

The reasons for not assuming additional

at least USD 2.5 million for each of the 21 units, being USD 52.5 million in total. The

982

Respondent interprets a statement from Mr Abdala,”~” when cross-examined, as an example

. . woe 3
of inconsistency related to this issue.**

521.The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, after more than 30 years of operation, major
replacements to be included under CAPEX would need to be made. However, taking into
account that operations would end in 2038 (28 years after the expropriation), this factor will
only apply to the units that had reached 30 years of operation by that year. Therefore, it is
assumed no CAPEX would be necessary or justified for units that would not yet have

reached more than 30/31 years of operation by 2038.

522. The Tribunal will also assume that the situation where the unit is expected to work for a few
more years past the 30 year mark is not the same as the situation in which the operations are
expected to continue for many more years. So, while the Tribunal accepts the USD 2.5
million value as the basis for the calculation of required CAPEX per unit on the basis that the
new investment would allow the unit to operate for another 28 years, it will adjust that value

according to the number of additional years of operation expected from each unit.

523. For all these assumptions and calculations, the Tribunal will refer to the table provided by

Mr Paz:™*

524. In accordance with the Tribunal’s decision and this table,

(a) GCH-11 and ARJ-9 to ARJ-15 will not need new CAPEX;

(b) ARJ-1 to ARJ-3 will need new CAPEX for a period of 8 years and Karachipampa for a

period of 6 years;

(c

GCH-1, GCH-2, and GCH-4 will need new CAPEX for 28 years, GCH-6 for a period of

(e) ARJ-8 will need new CAPEX for a period of 15 years.
525. This leads to CAPEX costs, summarized as follows:

- in 2011: USD 9,642,958 (USD 2.5 million for each of GCH-1, GCH-2, and GCH-4, and
USD 714,286 for each of ARJ-1 to ARJ-3);

527. The parties and their experts agree on a few things concerning the discount rate, but they

disagree on the specific value of most of its components and on whether some additional risk

factors should be added when calculating EGSA’s cost of equity, namely:

(a) a multiplier to be applied to Bolivia’s sovereign risk, to take into account the special

volatility of equity investments in emerging economies; and

(b) a “size premium”, to account for EGSA’s small size.

However, Rurelec argues that there should be consistency between their relative values,
since the degree of riskiness of a company affects both its creditors and its shareholders,
even if the latter are subordinated to the former and bear the company’s “residual risk”. In
Rurelec’s words, an excessive difference “between the cost of debt and cost of equity
suggests that creditors do not care about risks that are causing equity-holders to demand
high returns.”**° More specifically, Rurelec insists that “Dr Flores’ cost-of-debt/cost-of-
equity ratio of 3.51 is out of proportion with the 1.53 median ratio for the Santander sample,
while Dr Abdala’s ratio, 1.83, is much closer both to reality and to the sample’s median
ratio”

530. As it may be seen below, the Tribunal will determine a cost of equity for EGSA whose ratio
with EGSA’s commonly agreed cost of debt is higher than the one suggested by Rurelec, but

lower than the Respondent’s.

531. However, the Tribunal will not factor in, in the determination of the Discount Rate, the
actual ratio between equity and debt cost that would result from the Tribunal’s conclusions.
The Tribunal considers that it is more important to look directly at the actual costs, and notes
that the Parties have agreed on the cost of debt irrespective of their disagreement in relation
to equity costs. As such, the Tribunal concludes that it would not be appropriate to simply
calculate the cost of equity as a multiple of the cost of debt, as Compass Lexecon suggests.
The Tribunal will therefore analyse below each of the parameters whose value the parties

disagree on.

1. Risk-free rate

532. The first discrepancy is related to the risk-free rate. Both experts agree that the maturity of

the bond should be consonant with the life of EGSA’s cash flows to be discounted, but

disagree on the practical application of such criterion.

533.Compass Lexecon uses the yield of the 10-year US Treasury bond (i.e. 3.58%) and Econ

One the 20-year bond’s (i.e. 4.36%). According to Econ One, despite the 10-year bond’s

588

higher liquidity and lower volatility against changes in inflation,” the 20-year bond is more

appropriate to the timeframe being used.’ However, Compass Lexecon insists on the
appropriateness of its choice because the average “duration” of the cash flows for EGSA is

11 years, closer to the “duration” of the 10-year bond (i.e. approximately 9 years) than that

590

of the 20-year bond (i.e. approximately 14 years).”” Econ One retorts that the investment

bank’s reports (i.e. Banco Santander’s) cited by Compass Lexecon used in 2010 a yield of

159!

4.2%, which seems closer to Econ One’s proposal Mr Abdala asserts that his choice is

“not a question of hindsight”,”” since he used these reports mostly just for context, and the

evolution of Banco Santander’s estimates from 2009 to 2010 confirms his position.*”*

534. The Tribunal agrees with Econ One that the risk-free rate used by Banco Santander’s seems

closer to the yield of the 20-year bond than the 10-year bond. Yet, the Tribunal grants more
weight to Compass Lexecon’s argument that the choice of the relevant bond tenor should be
made on the basis of the “duration” of cash flows. The “duration” of EGSA’s cash flows (in
discounted terms) would in fact be even shorter—and even closer to that of the 10-year
bond—if a higher discount factor than Compass Lexecon’s 10.63% is used for discounting
purposes, since that will significantly diminish the discounted present value of EGSA’s most
distant cash flows. The Tribunal thus concludes that the yield of the 10-year US Treasury
Bonds should be used.

2. Market risk or equity premium

535.The next discrepancy relates to the market risk premium—commonly described in the
literature as the “equity premium’”—which represents the additional return over the risk-free
rate that an investor expects from holding a market portfolio of riskier securities, such as

shares in a company.

536. Even if the market premium is usually defined as an “expected” supplementary return—i.e.
as a forward-looking assessment of market risks during the years ahead—both sides and their
experts (in particular the Respondent), rely on the common procedure of equating such
“expected” value to the “historical” value of the premium during some past reference period.
Despite this simplification, three methodological issues arise on which the Parties’ responses

differ:

- the reference period from which the historical market premium is calculated;

- whether historical averages should be calculated as “arithmetic averages” or as
“geometric averages” of historical values; and

- the influence of the 2008-2009 international and US financial crisis on historical an
“expected” market premiums;

537. Compass Lexecon relies on Professor Damodaran, whose views on the appropriate value of
the market risk premium have changed several times as a result of the ups and downs of the
US equity market in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Up to the onset of the crisis,
Professor Damodaran had traditionally used a 4% market premium. However, in early 2009,
reflecting on the damage inflicted by the crisis to US equity portfolios during the last quarter
of 2008, he wrote: “[2008] has been a year that has shaken our faith in mean reversion and
using long term averages, especially when it comes to equity risk premiums and default
spreads. I have done my annual update for historical equity risk premiums for the United
States but 2008 has changed the numbers dramatically. The geometric average risk premium
for stocks over treasury bonds, going back to 1928, was 4.79% at the end of [2008], has
dropped to 3.88%, with premiums over shorter periods (10 years) becoming negative. The
implied equity risk premium, which was 4.37% at the end of 2007, jumped to 6.43% at the
end of [2008]. In the datasets that compute cost of equity and capital, I have abandoned

595

my practice of using historical risk premiums and used” a higher value (5%). Even that

5 For all the respect that Professor Damodaran commands among practitioners and financial experts, his texts are not always
fully polished. Professor Damodaran’s text literally refers to 2009, which seems to be an obvious mistake,as the document
was actually written in early 2009.

*5 Context suggests that Professor Damodaran did not mean “used” in the past, but rather “have now used” in the annual
update he is referring to.

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 186 of 208

may be too low a number. I would suggest that you up that number towards the current

implied equity risk premium, if you want a cost of equity and capital today.””°

538.A few months later, in October 2009, Professor Damodaran struck a slightly less sombre
note: “Though I believe that mean reversion is a powerful force, I think that the banking and
financial crisis of 2008 was unlike other market fevers and downturns in terms of exposing
weaknesses in developed capital markets. When valuing emerging markets prior to
September 2008, I used 4% as my mature market equity risk premium and based the estimate
on the average implied equity risk premium over time (1960-2007). Since October of 2008, I
have moved to a 5-6% mature market equity risk premium and will continue to use this
higher premium until I am convinced otherwise.”””"

539. Only four months later still, in February 2010, probably influenced by the recovery in US
equity markets, Professor Damodaran supplanted his last sentence in the above quote with
the following: “After the crisis, in the first half of 2009, I used equity risk premiums of 5-6%
in my valuations. Having watched the reversion of historical averages in 2009, my
valuations in 2010 will be based upon equity risk premiums of 4.5-5%. While some may view
this shifting equity risk premium as a sign of weakness, I would frame it differently. When
valuing individual companies, I want my valuations to reflect my assessments of the
company and not assessments of the overall equity market.’

540. As indicated, Compass Lexecon draws on Damodaran’s views and uses a 5% premium,
which, while at the low end of Damodaran’s views in October 2009 (as pointed out by Econ
One), was nonetheless at the high end of Damodaran’s estimate by February 2010, right

before EGSA’s nationalisation (as pointed out by Compass Lexecon).

541.Compass benchmarks its 5% estimate against the market premiums used in a “sample” of
“Investment Banks’ Reports”, which Rurelec submitted as document C-300. According to
Compass, the average market premium used in those reports is 5.8%, while the median is

5.5%.”

542.Econ One correctly argues that Compass’s estimates are partially based on reports made
public by Santander after EGSA’s nationalisation: the correct figure for the market risk

estimates in the “Informes de Analistas Financieros” should have been 6.5%.

543. Econ One’s own estimate of market risk, 6.7%, relies not on Damodaran, but on the equity
risk premiums calculated by Ibbotson/Morningstar in March 2010, as the arithmetic average

for equity premiums in the US market during the period 1926-2009.

544. After carefully considering the parties’ positions, the Tribunal has decided to accept an

equity premium of 5%, as suggested by Claimant.
3. Beta

545.In the CAPM methodology, “the market risk premium is weighted by the beta coefficient,
which measures a security's (or a group of securities’) exposure to general market risk.”

This is not contested. However some discrepancies remain as to the calculation of the Beta:

- the universe of US listed electricity companies from which the “unlevered beta” of
electric companies comparable to EGSA should be extracted; and

- the optimal debt-equity financial structure of a Bolivian electricity company like EGSA.
(i) Unlevered beta of US electricity companies comparable to EGSA

546. Compass Lexecon says it used “the industry beta of US-based firms in the electric power
generation, transmission, or distribution industry calculated by Morningstar (formerly
Ibbotson Associates) that corresponds to the SIC code 4911°®', and then explains the
procedure to adjust that “raw beta” to obtain a final figure of 0.77."

547.Econ One disagrees and states that the criterion used to select the comparable companies
used by Ibbotson/Morningstar for its report is unclear and does not correspond to SIC code
4911. In any event, Econ One suggests that instead of using SIC code 4911, Compass

603

Lexecon should have requested a custom report.” Following its criticism, Econ One

explains how it selected the 5 companies which it considers most comparable to EGSA.

Page 188 of 208

After de-leveraging the 1.34 raw beta of this set of comparable companies, it arrives at an
“unlevered adjusted beta” of 0.68. In its second report, Econ One further comments on and

criticizes Compass Lexecon’s analysis and maintains its figures.

548. In its second report, Compass Lexecon clarifies what it actually requested from Morningstar
and why it also criticizes Econ One’s sample of 5 US-based power generators and maintains

its figures.

549. The Tribunal has considered Compass Lexecon’s position that too small a sample may make
for unreliable beta valuations that are subject to a large margin of error, as well as Econ
One’s stance that the precision of the sample—and its focus on energy generation, the sole
activity of EGSA—is much more important than its size. In the end, the Tribunal has decided
to give precedence to the precision of the sample over its size, and thus accepts Econ One’s
unlevered and adjusted beta, i.e. 0.68, as applicable to a notional unlevered Bolivian electric

generator like EGSA.
(ii) EGSA’s optimal capital structure

550. After determining the “unlevered adjusted beta” of comparable US electricity companies, it
is now necessary, in keeping with the CAPM methodology, to determine the optimal
leverage ratio to apply to a Bolivian company like EGSA, with a view to calculate its

“levered beta”, i.e. the specific factor to apply to the general “market” or “equity premium”

discussed above.

55

-Both parties and their experts agree that, in the absence of market figures on optimal
leverage ratios for Bolivian companies, there is a need to rely on proxies from other

emerging economies.

552. Compass Lexecon posits a “raw beta” of 0.57 and a leverage ratio of 80.69%, and arrives at
an “unlevered and adjusted” beta of 0.48 for what it claims is the relevant sample of US
electric companies comparable to EGSA, while Econ One starts from a “raw beta” of 1.34
and a leverage ratio of 133.27%, which results in an “unlevered and adjusted” beta of 0.68

for the limited sample of US electric utilities that it considers comparable to EGSA.

553.Compass Lexecon uses as a proxy “the average capital structure observed for the same

comparables in the US SIC 4911 sample used in the calculation of the raw beta” and this

556.

PCA Case No. 2011-17

Page 189 of 208

results in an optimal debt-to-equity ratio of 80.69%.

Econ One criticizes Compass
Lexecon’s approach, since access to financial markets is more difficult for a Bolivian
company like EGSA than for an equivalent US one. As a proxy, it prefers the debt-equity
ratio for energy companies in emerging countries published by Professor Damodaran,
56.04%. Econ One’s approach is, in turn, criticized by Compass Lexecon, which refers in
its Rebuttal Report™” to EGSA’s debt-raising ability, as demonstrated by its actual debt-
equity ratio of 71.24% as at the end of 2009, a ratio significantly higher than Econ One’s

estimate.**

After carefully considering the divergent views of the Parties and their experts, the Tribunal
has come to the conclusion that the use of proxies from other markets to calculate EGSA’s
optimal capital structure is fraught with practical difficulties, since it is not easy to select a

sample of non-Bolivian companies with similar financial options to those available to EGSA.

The Tribunal has thus decided to simplify the calculation of EGSA’s optimal capital
structure and, rather than attempt to identify an elusive proxy, to use instead EGSA’s actual
debt/equity ratio as of the end of 2009, namely 71.24%, on the reasonable assumption that
EGSA’s actual debt-equity ratio was close, if not identical, to its “optimal” one. The ratio
ultimately taken also coincidentally falls in between the Parties’ estimated proxies. It shall be
used to re-lever the “unlevered adjusted beta” of US electricity companies comparable to
EGSA. This debt-equity ratio translates arithmetically into debt/capital and equity/capital
ratios of 41.60% and 58.40%, respectively, which will be used later on to calculate EGSA’s

“weighted” average cost of capital or WACC.%”
(iii) EGSA’s specific beta and equity premium

As explained in previous paragraphs, the Tribunal considers 0.68 to be the relevant

“unlevered adjusted beta” of electricity companies comparable to EGSA. It further considers

Compass Lexecon Report, (167.

& As indicated in line 15 of Table 2 above, the debt to capital ratio (41.60%) is the result of dividing the debt/equity ratio by
(1 + debt/equity), i.e. 0.7124/1.7124=0.4160. The difference between this number and 1 is the ratio equity/capital (0.5840).

PCA Case No. 2011-17

Page 190 of 208

0.7124 to be EGSA’s optimal debt-equity ratio. Using the latter ratio to re-lever the 0.68
unlevered beta results in a 1.047 final beta for EGSA.°"°

557. In keeping with the above, the resulting equity premium to be applied by a “willing buyer”
considering the purchase of EGSA would be 1.047 times the general 5% equity premium, i.e.
5.23%.

4. Country risk premium

558.The country risk premium is “the incremental return demanded by investors for an
investment in a country or location where the investment is exposed to greater risk than
would be the case in a more stable economy, like the U.S.”*"', Such “country” or “sovereign
risk” premium is typically calculated by looking at the spread implicit in the market yield of
sovereign bonds of the country traded in the international financial markets. However, since
no such Bolivian bonds existed as of the date of expropriation both parties were again

obliged to use a proxy.

559. To calculate it, Compass Lexecon considers it appropriate to construct “an EMBI [Emerging

Market Bond Index] proxy in accordance to the Sovereign Rating given to Bolivia by

   

Standard & Poor's, Fitch Ratings and Moody’s. To construct Bolivia’s EMBI proxy I

°6l2 and settles

computed the average EMBI for countries with the same rating as Bolivia’
upon a premium of 7.017%. Econ One accepts this methodology, subject to its views on the

1.5 multiplier to be discussed below.

560. The Tribunal agrees that it is appropriate to calculate country risk—as both parties have
done—using an index of emerging market bonds, and shall apply the resulting premium of

7.017%.
5. Should additional equity risk factors be added?

561.Rurelec considers that the CAPM model, with the addition of a country risk premium for
Bolivia, duly captures all the relevant factors necessary to calculate the cost of equity for an

electricity company like EGSA and arrives, thus, at a cost of capital of 14.45%. On the other

Page 191 of 208

hand, the Respondent claims that two additional add-ons should be included in EGSA’s cost

of capital, to reflect risks still not captured by Rurelec’s model:

- The additional risk of equity investments in emerging economies, not fully captured by
its sovereign country risk. In the Respondent’s view, this warrants the application of a
1.5 multiplier (i.e. a 50% increase) to the sovereign risk of the emerging country where
the company is located.

- The additional risk associated with small companies (the “size premium”), which in the

Respondent’s view would amount in EGSA’s case to 6.28%.

562. In the Tribunal’s views there are two issues to consider: first, whether the standard CAPM
model—as applied by Compass Lexecon—fully captures all the relevant risks for a willing
buyer considering the purchase of EGSA; and secondly, assuming a negative response to the
first question, which specific additional risks should be applied to the standard CAPM

model.

563. On the first question, the Tribunal shares the Respondent’s view that the standard CAPM—
at least as applied by Compass Lexecon—does not fully capture all the relevant risks for a
willing buyer considering the purchase of EGSA. The reasons for this view are explained

below.

564. Since the Tribunal has retained a beta-weighted equity premium for EGSA that is higher
than Compass Lexecon’s, the resulting equity cost would amount to 15.83% (i.e. 3.58% +
5.23% + 7.02%) if no additional risks factors were to be taken into account, as argued by
Compass Lexecon. Yet, in the Tribunal’s view that 15.83% rate still underestimates the

likely equity cost that would be used by a willing buyer of EGSA.

565. First, as recognized by Rurelec itself, when on September 3, 2008 the Board of Directors of
EGSA discussed Mr Lanza’s progress report on the new combined cycle project, the
calculations of the net present value of the new projects were made with a nominal discount
rate of 12.5%. Since such a discount rate is functionally equivalent to a WACC rate, as
applied in the present context, assuming the cost of debt and leverage ratio of EGSA did not
depart at that time significantly from the levels considered here (i.e. an after-tax cost of debt
of 5.91% and a 71.24% debt/equity ratio), the implicit equity cost considered by EGSA’s
directors was 17.2%, i.e. almost 3 full points above the 14.45% used by Rurelec and

significantly above the Tribunal’s 15.83% as well.

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 192 of 208

566. Even making allowances for some drop in the risk-free rate from September 2008 to May
2010 and for Mr Abdala’s argument, in response to the Tribunal’s questions, that a willing
buyer would naturally espouse relatively optimistic views about the future of EGSA—for
otherwise it would not have bid for the company—it would be quite extraordinary for an
outside buyer, not as familiar with a company as its own managers and directors, to consider
it less risky than those insiders. As such, 17.2% can reasonably be taken a lower limit for the

return on equity required by a willing buyer of EGSA.

567.Secondly, as indicated by the Respondent, Mr Earl himself, acting in September 2005 as
CEO of Independent Power South Africa (IPSA), when describing potential electric projects
in South Africa to investors in the UK’s Alternative Investment Markets, declared that the
company expected to select projects with an Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of no less than
20%. This was in 2005, not 2010; moreover, the IRR represents the highest discount factor
which would make the project not have a negative present value, rather than a normal
WACC, and the 20% project IRR was probably aspirational, as befits a pitch to potential
investors. Nevertheless, it is a clear indication that the cost of equity of EGSA, as calculated
by Rurelec under a standard CAPM methodology, fails to reflect all the risks taken into

consideration by real equity investors in emerging economies.

568. Lastly, the Tribunal, as mentioned to the Parties during the hearings, has made an effort to
compare the equity costs and WACCs espoused by the parties with the alternative
benchmark set out in Article 48 of the 1994 Electricity Act (Law 1604, dated December 21,
1994), still in force at the time of the expropriation, which states that “[t]he discount rate
(‘tasa de actualizaci6n’) to be used when applying this law shall be ten per cent (10%)
annually, in real terms. This rate shall only be modified by the Ministry by way of a duly-
justified administrative decision. The new discount rate set by the Ministry shall not differ
from the prevailing rate by more than two (2) percentage points.” [Tribunal’s translation]°"?

569. The Respondent claims that this discount factor applies only to the calculation of capacity
payments, based on the notional purchase of new turbines with an expected 20 year-life, far
less than EGSA’s 28-year total authorization period, in a context very different from the

calculation of the EGSA’s FMV as of the time of expropriation.

It is true that the official discount rate enshrined in the law—increased to 12% in real terms
as of 2000°—has only ever been used in practice to calculate capacity payments. However,
for the sake of this benchmarking exercise, one may assume that it is possible to use this
discount factor for other purposes, including the valuation of an expropriated company (a
scenario that, for obvious reasons, is unlikely to have been made express in a 1994 Law

whose declared purpose was to attract foreign investment in Bolivia’s electricity sector).

Having accepted the Respondent’s view that the standard CAPM fails to reflect all the
relevant risks which would have been taken into account by a WB, it is now necessary to
discuss the specific risk add-ons advocated by the Respondent, namely, a 1.5 country risk

multiplier and a so-called “size premium”.
6. The 1.5 country risk multiplier

Econ One applies a 1.5 multiplier to Compass Lexecon’s sovereign country risk for Bolivia
(i.e. 7.02%) and arrives at a premium of 10.526%, which melds Bolivia’s sovereign risk with
the special volatility of equity markets in emerging economies like Bolivia. This adjustment
is based on Professor Damodaran’s methodology, and his concept of “country equity risk
premium”, as described in the following statement: “The country default spreads that come
with country ratings provide an important first step, but still only measure the premium for
default risk. Intuitively, we would expect the country equity risk premium to be larger than
the country default risk spread. To address the issue of how much higher, we look at the
volatility of the equity market in a country relative to the volatility of the bond market used to

estimate the spread.”**

Professor Damodaran has further estimated that, “[i]n 2008, for instance, there were 28
emerging markets, where both the equity market volatility and the government bond
volatility numbers were available. The median ratio, across these markets, of equity market

volatility to bond price volatility was approximately 1.50.”°'°

Compass Lexecon takes issue with Econ One’s multiplier, and argues that, in Professor
Damodaran’s view, this correction should apply only to short-term valuations, since equity

markets may be more volatile than bond markets in the short run, but there is a natural

tendency for both volatilities to converge in the long run. Besides, when Damodaran uses the
multiplier, he applies it to country sovereign “default spreads”, which are based on their
credit ratings and in Bolivia amounted to just 5.50%, much lower than the 7.02% rate

estimated by Compass Lexecon on the basis of sovereign bond spreads.

575.Econ One retorts that Damodaran has never written that his multiplier applied only to short
term valuations. Besides, he has used it himself in the valuation of investments in his native
India.°"’ Moreover, there is no natural tendency for the volatility of bonds and equities to
converge, since, as argued by corporate finance professors Smithers and Wright, bonds are
intrinsically less volatile than equities on two counts: “The first is that the income element is
so much more important relative to changes in capital values. The second is that bonds are
usually repayable at par, so that investors know in advance how much they will receive when
the bond is repaid on maturity.”°'*

576. The Tribunal has carefully considered Econ One’s case for a 1.5 multiplier, and has come to

the conclusion that no multiplier should be applied. There are several reasons for this.

577. It is not accurate to describe the multiplier as the methodology of Professor Damodaran. It is
just the third one—the so-called “Melded Approach”—of a set of three alternative
approaches to assess the country-specific risk of equity investments, the two others being the
“Country Bond Default Spread’”—the one applied by Compass, in which the country’s
sovereign risk stands on its own, without correction, and it is added to the US equity risk
premium—and the “Relative Equity Market Standard Deviations”—which ignores sovereign
risks and directly assesses equity risk premiums in emerging economies by correcting the US
equity risk premium with an index of relative volatility of equity markets in the

corresponding emerging economy and in the US.

578.Contrary to Econ One’s assertion, Professor Damodaran is on record as favouring Econ
One’s multiplier (i.e. the “melded approach”, his third and last one) only for short term
valuations. For instance, he writes that “[w]e believe that the larger country risk premiums
that emerge from the last approach are the more realistic for the immediate future, but that
country risk premiums will decline over time. [...] One way to adjust country risk premiums
over time is to begin with the premium that emerges from the melded approach and to adjust
this premium down towards either the country bond default spread or the country premium

estimated from equity standard deviations. Another way of presenting this argument is to

°7 4. Damodaran, “Valuation”, undated (Exhibit EO-71).

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 195 of 208

note that the differences between standard deviations in equity and bond prices narrow over

longer periods and the resulting relative volatility will generally be smaller. Thus the equity

risk premium will converge to the country bond default spread as we look at longer term
expected returns, As an illustration, the country risk premium for Brazil would be 7.67% for

the next year, but decline over time to either 6.01% (country default spread) or 3.60%

(relative standard deviation)” (emphasis added).°”

579. Similarly, on another occasion, he wrote, “J add this default spread to the historical risk
premium for a mature equity market (estimated from US historical data) to estimate the total
risk premium. In the short term especially, the equity country risk premium is likely to be
greater than the country’s default spread” (emphasis added).°”

580. Damodaran has indeed applied the multiplier in valuations of equity investments in India, as
claimed by Econ One, but these concerned a 5-year investment in Tata Chemicals and a 10-

year in Wipro, a period far shorter than EGSA’s 28-year planning horizon.

581.The argument of Professors Smithers and Wright regarding the different structure of the
return of bonds and equities is also not particularly compelling in the case of EGSA, whose
expected cash flows consist purely of yearly income, with no residual value, and thus have a
financial structure closer to a high-coupon long term bond than to a short or medium-term

equity investment.

582. Finally, there is an even more fundamental reason which, in the Tribunal’s mind, justifies the
rejection of Econ One’s multiplier, but the acceptance, as explained below, of an additional
illiquidity risk premium—or better yet, additional overall risk premium, as explained
below—telated (though not identical) to Econ One’s “size premium”. Professor
Damodaran’s multiplier attempts to capture the volatility of short-term equity investments in
companies whose shares are publicly traded in stock exchanges, which are subject to the
short-term vagaries and volatility of organized financial markets. But such volatility should
not penalize, as such, the value of non-listed companies like EGSA, whose value should be
assessed using the “fundamental approach” typical of long-term investors. Similarly, as a
non-listed company, EGSA’s discount factor should not reflect any other quirk or anomaly

typical of stock markets, even if it should nevertheless include a different add-on which

reflects one of the fundamental disadvantages of any private, non-traded stock: its intrinsic

illiquidity.

583.The Tribunal’s conclusion is that it will not add a specific multiplier. However, when
looking at the issue of “size premium” below, the Tribunal will take into account some of the

underlying factors argued by the Parties in relation to the multiplier.
7. Size Premium

584.One of the major divergences between the experts relates to the application of a size
premium to the valuation. It is in fact an ideological and philosophical issue, as the experts
are in total diametrical opposition to one another: Econ One applies a 6.28% size premium
which is adamantly rejected by Compass Lexecon. A substantial part of the hearings dealt

with this issue.

585. Econ One argues™' that, as explained in the financial literature and shown by historic stock
market records, the returns of small companies are statistically higher than the market
22

average, since they are perceived by markets as riskier and must thus offer higher yields.

The standard CAPM and Compass’ methodology fail to include this “size premium”.

586. Actual premiums paid depend on company size. Ibbotson/Morningstar has calculated their
value in “Markets Results for Stocks, Bonds, Bills and Inflation” by classifying similar
companies in ten groups by capitalization. Using EGSA’s equity value as a proxy for its
market capitalization, EGSA would belong in the tenth smallest decile (“/0-Smallest’),

whose historical size premium is, according to Ibbotson/Morningstar, 6.28%."

587.Compass Lexecon starts its Rebuttal Report by tracing the size premium to illiquidity issues,
as indicated by Professor Damodaran:™ “practitioners attribute all or a significant portion
of the small stock premium reported by Ibbotson Associates to illiquidity and add it on as an

illiquidity premium.”

588. After that initial statement, Compass Lexecon rejects the application of a size premium to
EGSA’s discount rate on several grounds. First, it argues that whilst some authors support
the use of size premium (as Fama and French did in 1992), others reject its inclusion, with
some claiming that it existed in the distant past, but almost disappeared since the 1980s.
Most recently, Fama and French’s 2012 empirical study of 23 countries in North America,
Europe, Japan, and the Asia Pacific indicates that the size premium effect is non-existent.
Secondly, some authors claim that the “size premium” can largely be attributed to the so-
called “January effect”, i.e. the specific effect on relatively illiquid stocks of the practice of
many US investors, either for tax or window-dressing purposes, of selling some shares in

December and buying them back in January.

589. Compass Lexecon attaches importance to a paper by Tarbell,° which provides a list of
company characteristics that cause higher returns for investors in small companies. The main
factors included (i) difficulty in raising financing, (ii) high sensitivity to business risks, (iii)
lack of dividend history, (iv) lack of externally generated information (i.e. investment banks
reports), and (v) lack of management expertise. Compass Lexecon asserts that none of the
previous items apply to EGSA,° and disagrees that it is a small company. Compass
Lexecon also draws attention to the fact that, in South America, with its highly regulated and
low volatility energy markets, it is “not customary” to apply the size premium. Therefore,
Compass Lexecon considers that no grounds exist to apply the size premium, as the CAPM

approach will capture EGSA’s default risk.°”’

590.In its Second Report,°* Econ One emphasizes its arguments and insists that the size
premium is clearly justified. At the hearings, Mr Flores stated that, if the markets were fully

efficient, no reason would exist for the size premium.©”

hearings and corrected it (See Abdala’s Cross-Examination, Transcript (English), Day 5, 8 April 2013, 1130)

 

6 Also, in accordance with Mr Abdala, even if any of those items existed, the size premium would not be used

automatically, as its potential application would become a matter of judgment (see Abdala’s Cross-Examination, Transcript
(English), Day 5, 8 April 2013, 1132). Mr Abdala noted that in more than 150 valuations he had only used size premium in
one or two cases in which very severe illiquidity situations were present (see Abdala’s Cross-Examination, Transcript

591.Rurelec, after all the information provided by the experts and in cross examination, states
that “many leading scholars take the view that smaller companies do not on average attract
a higher return, and that therefore all risks relevant to a willing buyer and seller are already
incorporated in the CAPM derived discount rate and cash flows.”** Rurelec relies on Fama
and French,®" stating that the Ibbotson/Morningstar report “undermines the applicability of
the size premium in the present case” and criticizing the fact that the Respondent “applied a

massive 6.28% premium solely on the basis of Guaracachi’s book value”.°?

592. For Rurelec, “small company risks fall into two basic categories: risks relating to hidden

defects and risks relating to a volatility of revenues. Neither was relevant to Guaracachi”**
and in any event, Rurelec considers that Mr Flores admitted in cross examination that the
634

size premium should be 4.91% instead of 6.28%.
593.This is not the end of the matter for the Respondent, as it states that even Mr Abdala
admitted in cross examination that the size premium could be justified in certain

circumstances.°*

However, the main argument offered by the Respondent seems to be that,
even if one were to accept that a size premium should only be applied if the conditions cited
by Tarbell and adopted by Compass Lexecon are met (or, more precisely, if at least one of

them is met), the fact is that EGSA falls within some of the situations listed.**

594. The Tribunal has carefully considered Econ One’s and Compass Lexecon’s arguments for
and against a “size premium’—which, as already indicated, Econ One argues should be
6.28% —and has come to the conclusion that there are compelling reasons to add an
additional risk premium of 4.5% to EGSA’s required cost of equity, which, while similar in

its effects to Econ One’s “size premium”, might be more appropriately called an “illiquidity

premium”, or better yet an “additional risk premium”, as it also encompasses some aspects
that the Tribunal considers relevant among those discussed by the Parties when addressing

the multiplier issue.

595. The reasons underpinning the Tribunal’s decision are as follows. To start, the Tribunal is not
persuaded that a “size premium”, as understood by the Respondent, should apply to EGSA.
First, while there seems to be some statistical evidence that such “size premium” can be
derived from the analysis of the historical series of long-term returns in the US stock
markets, there is controversy as to (i) whether the premium has disappeared in recent
decades and (ii) whether it applies to non-US stock markets. These considerations are
especially relevant for EGSA, since the notional willing buyer would be expected to take a
forward-looking approach in which past historical series are only relevant as a proxy for
expected future trends, and may not necessarily be a US-based firm (let us recall that IEL
and Rurelec were UK-based investors which bought EGSA from US-based GPU-First
Energy).

596. Secondly, even if the premium were clearly detectable in the historical returns of small listed
companies and likely to remain relevant for investors in May 2010, its underlying cause
might be relevant and have an impact on EGSA’s valuation. For instance, were it true that
the “size premium” is mostly the result of a “January effect” related to a seasonal, tax-related
or window-dressing pattern in the sale and subsequent purchase of shares of US-listed
companies, then it could hardly be considered applicable to an unlisted company like EGSA.
The same would apply were the “size premium” to be the indirect result of a “survivorship
bias” whereby the recorded historical returns of small companies is inflated due to the failure
to include the dismal returns of once-listed firms which, faced with a crisis, choose to de-

list—a situation which befalls small firms far more often than big firms.

597. Thirdly, it is also questionable whether the size of a company should be measured in
absolute terms from a worldwide perspective—comparing Bolivian EGSA to US companies
as suggested by Econ One—or relative to the economy in which the company operates—as
suggested by Rurelec. Indeed, if, as Econ One suggests, the “size premium” reflects the
special risks borne by small companies, a case could be made in favour of a relative,
country-related definition of size, since a locally-big, even if internationally-small, company
catering exclusively to its domestic market might not face particular risks, and might even

enjoy potential “market power” of concern to domestic regulatory authorities.

Page 200 of 208

598. Yet, having rejected the direct application to EGSA of the concept of “size premium” as
defined by the Respondent, the Tribunal has duly noted Rurelec’s quote of Professor
Damodaran that “practitioners attribute all or a significant portion of the small stock
premium reported by Ibbotson Associates to illiquidity and add it on as an illiquidity
premium’, which it finds compelling. Indeed, if one delves deeper into the source of that

quote, one finds the following statements by Professor Damodaran:

“If illiquidity is a risk associated with an investment, it seems logical that we should
be using higher discount rates for cash flows on an illiquid investment than for cash
flows on a liquid investment. The question then becomes one of measuring illiquidity
and translating that measure into a discount rate effect. [...] In conventional asset
pricing models, the required rate of return for an asset is a function of its exposure to
market risk. Thus, in the CAPM, the cost of equity is a function of the beta of an asset
[...] There is little in these models that allows for illiquidity. Consequently, the
required rate of return will be the same for liquid and illiquid assets with similar
market risk exposure. In recent years, there have been attempts to expand these

models to allow for illiquidity risk in one of two ways [...Y"°"

599. Later in the paper, Professor Damodaran argues further as follows:

“In practice, t]o adjust the discount rate used in discounted cash flow valuation for
illiquidity, you have to add an illiquidity premium to the discount rate and derive a
lower value for the same set of expected cash flows. The asset pricing models that
attempt to incorporate illiquidity risk are not specific about how we should go about
estimating the additional premium (other than saying that it should be larger for
investments which are illiquid when the market is illiquid). There are two practical
solutions to the estimation problem: [The first one is to a]dd a constant illiquidity
premium to the discount rate for all illiquid assets to reflect the higher returns earned
historically by less liquid (but still traded) investments, relative to the rest of the
market. This is akin to another very common adjustment made to discount rates in
practice, which is the small stock premium. The costs of equity for smaller companies
are often augmented by 3-3.5% reflecting the excess returns earned by smaller cap
companies over very long periods. The same historical data that we rely on for the

small stock premium can provide us with an estimate of an ‘illiquidity premium’.

Page 201 of 208

- Practitioners attribute all or a significant portion of the small stock premium
reported by Ibbotson Associates to illiquidity and add it on as an illiquidity

premium.

An alternative estimate of the premium emerges from studies that look at venture
capital returns over long period. Using data from 1984-2004, Venture Economics,
estimated that the returns to venture capital investors have been about 4% higher
than the returns on traded stocks. We could attribute this difference to illiquidity
and add it on as the ‘illiquidity premium’ for all private companies.”°*

600. The Tribunal has quoted Damodaran at length because, having been submitted and relied
upon by Rurelec, the Tribunal finds this source extremely persuasive. The shares of non-
listed companies, like EGSA, should be considered illiquid. Hence, while they are not
subject to the vagaries and volatility of stock markets, they should attract a significant
illiquidity premium, which in the case of EGSA the Tribunal has decided to estimate at
4.5%, a little higher than the highest illiquidity premiums mentioned by Professor

Damodaran.

601. While cognisant of Rurelec’s arguments that EGSA was not a “greenfield project”, but a
well-established mature company producing a steady supply of profits, the Tribunal has
decided to opt for a higher illiquidity premium, bearing in mind the other separate concept of

“jlliquidity” discussed previously in this Award: EGSA’s tight cash flow position.

602. It is true that EGSA’s “liquidity problem”, ie. its lack of cash, was considered by the
Tribunal as a temporary problem and is totally unrelated to the concept of “illiquidity” of
non-listed shares discussed in Professor Damodaran’s paper. But, as indicated by the
Tribunal, it might arguably have had some influence on the risk perception of EGSA’s
notional willing buyer. And, rather than allowing for a separate risk factor to account for
EGSA’s liquidity problems, the Tribunal has decided to ratchet up the level of the general

“jlliquidity premium”, and set it at 4.5%.
8. Conclusion on discount factor

603.In keeping with the Tribunal’s previous conclusions that EGSA’s cost of equity as of May
2010 could reasonably be estimated at 20.33%, with the Tribunal’s finding that EGSA’s
optimal debt-equity ratio could be approximated by its actual 0.7124 ratio—which translates

arithmetically into a debt/capital and an equity/capital ratio of 41.60% and 58.40%,
respectively—and with the Parties’ common acceptance of a 5.91% after-tax cost of debt, the
Tribunal’s resulting WACC works out to 14.33%, which shall be the factor used by the

Tribunal to discount EGSA’s expected free flow of funds.

K. EGSA’s FMV

604. If we now apply a 14.33% discount rate to EGSA’s expected free flow of funds (as described
in Annex A), the overall firm value of EGSA in May 2010 turns out to be USD 150.55
million. Finally, if we subtract from such firm value EGSA’s USD 92.7 million in financial
debt and bear in mind that Rurelec indirectly held 50.00125% of EGSA's capital, the actual
compensation of Rurelec at that date should be USD 28.93 million.

L. INTEREST RATE

605. Article 5 (1) of the UK-Bolivia BIT provides that compensation “shall include interest at a
normal commercial or legal rate, whichever is applicable in the territory of the

expropriating Contracting Party, until the date of payment”.

606. Rurelec argues that the expropriation was a wrongful act and, consequently, interest “is a
component of, and should give effect to, the principle of full reparation. Thus, the
requirement of full reparation must inform all aspects of an interest award, including the

appropriate rate of interest, and whether interest should be simple or compound’ °”

607.In more practical terms, Rurelec considers EGSA’s WACC (ie. 10.63%) “as the
appropriate rate to compensate for the lost opportunity to re-invest the funds of which they
have been deprived as a consequence of the breaches of the Treaties, that is, the deprivation
of the opportunity cost of capital. Otherwise stated, the cash flows that Guaracachi lost as a
result of the treaty breaches would have been subject to the risk of its business activities,
because those cash flows could have been used in those activities. Using an interest rate
equivalent to the WACC thus ensures that full reparation is made by Bolivia. To apply a risk-

free rate of interest would be to assume that (Rurelec] would have invested their resources in

PCA Case No. 2011-17
Award
Page 203 of 208

risk-free instruments, such as US Government bonds. This does not reflect commercial

reality".

608. Rurelec further argues that its proposal is consistent with Vivendi v. Argentina—where the
tribunal based its pre-award interest on the claimant’s cost of capital—and Alpha
Projektholding v. Ukraine—where the tribunal calculated pre-award interest on the basis of
the “risk-free rate plus the market risk premium’ for a total interest rate of 9.11%, on the
basis that “this rate better reflects the opportunity cost associated with Claimant’s losses,
adjusted for the risks of investing in Ukraine” °

609. The Respondent rejects Rurelec’s WACC argument for two main reasons. First, it is at odds
with the applicable BIT since it envisages that interest accrue at a “commercial or legal rate”
and the WACC is neither. Secondly, using EGSA’s WACC is wrong from a conceptual point
of view, since it factors in business risks associated with EGSA from which Rurelec was
relieved through the expropriation. Using WACC would therefore overcompensate Rurelec

for risks which they have no longer borne since May 2010.

610.In the Respondent’s view, were the Tribunal to condemn Bolivia to pay compensation, an
appropriate interest rate would be the USD LIBOR 1-year rate, which stood on average at
around 0.9% between May 2010 and October 2012, plus a reasonable commercial spread

which Econ One estimates at 2%."

6

- Concerning whether interest should be simple or compound, Rurelec requests compound
interest, “in line with the jurisprudence constante to this effect in international investment
law”. The Respondent adamantly rejects compound interest on two grounds. First, the
Respondent argues that, as stated by the tribunal in CME v. Czech Republic B.V.“°, it has
seldom been used in international investment arbitration until recently. Secondly, it is not

allowed under Bolivian law.“

612. In order to determine the interest rate, the Tribunal must decide three separate issues. First,
the Tribunal must decide whether, as argued by Rurelec, the Tribunal can depart from the

criteria established under Article 5 of the UK-Bolivia BIT and apply the principle of “full

reparation”, inasmuch as the BIT’s criteria apply only to lawful expropriations and not
wrongful ones, as argued by Rurelec. Secondly, the Tribunal must determine what interest
rate should be applied in the circumstances of this case. Lastly, the Tribunal must decide

whether interest should accrue at a simple or compound rate.

613. On the first question, the Tribunal has concluded that it should continue to apply the terms of
Article 5 of the UK-Bolivia BIT. The BIT makes no distinction between the compensation to
be provided in respect of an unlawful expropriation as opposed to a lawful one, and the
Tribunal does not find any reason to believe that the illegality of the expropriation renders

what the BIT deems to be “just and effective compensation” suddenly inadequate.

614. The illegality of the expropriation could, according to the authorities cited by Rurelec, justify
shifting the effective date of valuation back to a date later than the actual date of the
expropriation as a means to restore the Parties to the positions they would have held but for
the unlawful expropriation. However, Rurelec has opted not to argue for the application of
this principle in this case, presumably because its application would actually work to
Rurelec’s disadvantage. Yet, at the same time Rurelec asks the Tribunal to use EGSA’s
WACC as at May 2010 as the applicable interest rate to compensate it as if it had remained
invested in Bolivia throughout the pre-award period. Rurelec cannot shield itself from any
negative changes to the fundamentals that make up the WACC during the post-May 2010
period and simultaneously introduce the May 2010 WACC through the backdoor as the most

appropriate interest rate.

615.The Tribunal must therefore reject the application of EGSA’s May 2010 WACC as the
applicable interest rate, both because it does not constitute “a normal commercial or legal
rate”, as well as for the precisely the reasons set forth by Econ One’s Dr Flores: the WACC
includes an ex ante allowance for forward-looking business risks which should not be
applied ex post, since Rurelec has not faced them since May 2010. The Tribunal instead
decides to apply the annual interest rate reported on the website of the Central Bank of
Bolivia for USD commercial loans in May 2010, i.e. 5.633331% which it regards as

constituting a reasonable normal commercial rate.

616. As for the question of simple versus compound interest, the Tribunal considers that this issue
does not fall within the ambit of the UK-Bolivia BIT’s reference to the rate “applicable in
the territory of the expropriating Contracting Party”. Moreover, the Tribunal doubts that any
prohibition of compound interest that may exist under Bolivian law is applicable to

commercial loans, as opposed to consumer loans, and questions whether Bolivia should be

Award
Page 205 of 208

allowed to avail itself of potential limits imposed by the BIT on compensation that it has
failed to provide “without delay” or at all. The Tribunal therefore decides to use compound

interest in accordance with normal commercial practice.

617. As a result, the Tribunal decides that the 5.633331% annual interest rate reported by the

Central Bank of Bolivia at May 1, 2010 shall be applied, on a compound basis, from that

date until the date of full payment of the compensation as determined in this Award.”

CHAPTER XI - COSTS

618.Each side has claimed its costs from the other side in accordance with the UNCITRAL

Rules. Article 42(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that “[t]he costs of the arbitration
shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral
tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that

apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.”

619. Costs are therefore to be awarded to the successful party and against the unsuccessful party,

unless the circumstances of the case justify a different approach. In this case, however, there
is no clearly successful party. The Tribunal has upheld its jurisdiction in respect of Rurelec
and found the Respondent liable to pay compensation. Yet, in reaching that result, the
Tribunal has upheld two of the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections. One of these
objections, regarding the Respondent’s right to deny the benefits of the US-Bolivia BIT,
resulted in a total lack of jurisdiction over the claims of one of the two Claimants, GAI.
Moreover, the Respondent has also been largely successful on quantum, reducing the
compensation ultimately awarded to less than a quarter of the original claim. From a
technical point of view, GAT has thus been wholly unsuccessful in these proceedings and
Rurelec only partially successful. Therefore, inasmuch as it may be said that Rurelec has
been forced to undertake these proceedings to obtain the “just and effective compensation”
that Bolivia wrongfully denied it, it can equally be said that Bolivia has been forced to
defend itself on the “New Claims” and certain elements of quantum which were ultimately

unfounded.

620. The Tribunal does not consider that there any further circumstances of the case that weigh

621.

heavily in favour of one side or the other on costs. In particular, the Tribunal considers that
the Parties and their counsel have been exemplary in their conduct in what has naturally been
a hard-fought battle between them to defend their respective rights. As such, given the mixed
success on both sides, the Tribunal has decided that each side should bear their own legal
and other costs incurred in connection with the arbitration and the Parties should divide the

Tribunal’s, PCA’s, and appointing authority’s fees and expenses equally.

Over the course of the proceedings, the Parties deposited with the PCA a total of EUR
100,000 (EUR 50,000 by each side) and USD 950,000 (USD 450,000 by each side) to cover
the costs of the arbitration. The arbitrators’ fees and expenses were USD 153,437.50 in fees
and USD 1,766.38 in expenses for Dr Conthe, USD 202,000.00 in fees and USD 14,346.67
in expenses for Dr Vinuesa, and USD 296,250.00 in fees and USD 3,475.50 in expenses for

Dr Jiidice. The PCA’s fees for registry services in this arbitration total USD 91,777.47. Other
tribunal costs, including court reporting, interpretation, hearing and meeting facilities, travel,
teleconferencing, bank charges, tribunal witness expenses, and all other expenses related to

the proceedings total 259,409.19.

622.This leaves an unexpended balance of USD 53,732.29 on deposit. Seeing as the Parties
deposited equal amounts and it has been decided that the Parties shall divide the fees and
expenses of the Tirbunal, PCA and appointing authority equally, the unexpended balance of
the deposit shall be reimbursed in equal shares (USD 26,866,14 to each side).

DISSENTING OPINION OF CO-ARBITRATOR MANUEL CONTHE

1. Irespectfully disagree with my colleagues on three questions which I consider to be related:
Bolivia’s alleged compliance with due process, the Tribunal’s finding of a lack of
jurisdiction of over the spot price and capacity payment claims, and the equal division of

costs.

2. In my opinion:

(i) Bolivia’s expropriation failed to comply with the requirements of due process.

(ii) The Tribunal should have dismissed the spot price and capacity payment claims on
the merits, not for lack of jurisdiction, but limiting itself to explain why they did not

violate the Treaty.

(iii) The Tribunal should have ordered Bolivia to pay costs, at least partially.

Bolivia failed to comply with the requirements of due process.

3. In my view, the expropriation of EGSA by Bolivia constituted a “seizure” because, besides
not paying compensation, the process Bolivia followed to determine the market value of
EGSA did not respect the requirements of “due process” set forth in Article 5 of the UK-
Bolivia BIT. It is true that the Spanish version of the Treaty translates “due process” as “por
procedimientos juridicos”, an unfortunate expression, as it lacks the long history,
jurisprudence, and legal background of the English term “due process” and is rather obscure.
But, in keeping with the principles of the Vienna Convention, such obscure Spanish term
should be understood as “due process”, a term frequently translated into Spanish as “proceso

debido”.

4. As it is evident that a “due process” requirement must establish some minimum standard if
it is to merit the title of “duwe’”—amongst other reasons, because this is required by the
principle of “most favoured nation” treatment enshrined in Article 3 of the Treaty—the
question arises: what are the minimum requirements that the expropriation procedure should

have complied with?

5. In my view, an expropriation—as an administrative act infringing upon the rights of an

individual—must meet, from a legal point of view, three minimum procedural requirements:

6.

PCA Case No. 2011-17

Dissent of Co-Arbitrator Manuel Conthe

Page 2 of 4

(i) It must be reasoned—i.e. accompanied by a justification of its key features (in this

case, a report or analysis that justified the zero value attributed to EGSA).

(ii) Both the act and its reasons must be formally communicated to the individual.

(iii) The legal procedure in question should allow the individual, after being notified of
such reasons, to be heard before the State adopts its final decision (i.e. sets the final

fair value).

Bolivia appeared to intend to fulfil the first requirement because ENDE retained the
PROFIN consulting firm to prepare a valuation report. However, it promptly thereafter

disregarded these minimum requirements of “due process”:

(i) As noted in the “basis and limitations” section of the PROFIN report, the consulting
firm conceived of the report as a secret “strategic document” for the Bolivian
Government’s use in its negotiations with GAI, from which it can be surmised that

PROFIN did not act with full impartiality.

(ii) That report was never communicated to Rurelec, who became aware of it only when

it was submitted by Bolivia in this arbitration as exhibit R-154.

(iii) Bolivia never gave Rurelec the opportunity to make submissions in response to that

valuation.

In sum, a secret strategic report cannot legally constitute the required justification for an

administrative act which infringes upon rights.

Bolivia thus breached its Treaty with the United Kingdom, not only because it
underestimated the value of EGSA, but also because it failed to comply with the minimum

requirements of due process under Article 5 when establishing that zero valuation.

The Tribunal should have upheld its jurisdiction over the “New Claims”

The breach of due process by Bolivia in the expropriation strengthens the Claimants’
argument that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over what Bolivia has called the “New Claims”
despite the stipulation in Article 8 of the Treaty of a 6-month waiting period following

written notice “of the claim.”

. The Claimants refer to several awards (in particular, Lauder, Abaclat, SGS v. Pakistan,

Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, etc.) characterizing such waiting periods as purely procedural,

Dissent of Co-Arbitrator Manuel Conthe

rather than jurisdictional, in nature. Those arguments become stronger still, in my opinion,
when a tribunal must determine whether it has jurisdiction to rule on certain claims ancillary

to a main claim relating to a seizure.

. If Bolivia did not respect the most basic requirements of due process when expropriating

EGSA, how could it be entitled to require the Claimants to separately notify claims
concerning spot prices and capacity payments and wait six months, even though such
claims, if accepted by the Tribunal, would have increased the value of EGSA and,
consequently, the amount of compensation due? In my view, given that Bolivia failed to
abide by minimum standards of due process in the nationalization of EGSA, it is
unreasonable to interpret Article 8 of the Treaty so as to require separate notification by the

expropriated individuals of these claims, which were ancillary to the main claim.

. By the same token, a person who is expelled from a foreign country by a public authority

who, without undertaking any administrative procedure, de facto takes his or her home
without paying compensation, should be entitled to claim not only its value when it was
taken, but also the loss of value suffered when, shortly beforehand, the same authorities—in
that person’s eyes, unfairly—reduced the area of the garden or the property’s building

rights.

. I nevertheless share the rest of the Tribunal’s view on substance that the 2007 and 2008

decisions did not violate the Treaty, since they were not discriminatory or arbitrary and,
hence, should have been dismissed by the Tribunal on the merits. I find it, however,
somewhat paradoxical that the Tribunal, after rejecting its jurisdiction on the “new claims”,
included in its award a long, unrefined obiter dicta on States’ unrestrained right to introduce
regulatory changes, provided they do not jeopardize the financial viability of the affected

firms.

The Tribunal should have ordered Bolivia to pay costs, at least partially

14.

Bolivia’s breach of due process should have also led the Tribunal order costs against

Bolivia, at least partially.

. Indeed, Bolivia’s failure to comply with due process forced the Claimants to commence this

arbitration and has produced costs that will reduce their effective compensation. It is true
that, like so many other aggrieved claimants, Rurelec “inflated” its claims and the Tribunal
has rejected a substantial part of them. However, it is particularly appropriate to point out, in

a case concerning a power sector applying the principle of “marginal cost”, that the

PCA Case No. 2011-17

Dissent of Co-Arbitrator Manuel Conthe

Page 4 of 4

Claimants’ dismissed claims produced only a small “marginal cost” for these proceedings:
the Tribunal’s and Parties’ costs were largely fixed and would not have been much lower
had Rurelec claimed exactly the amount of compensation that the Tribunal has awarded.
Thus, the Claimants’ exaggeration of their claims has not imposed a significant “marginal
cost” upon Bolivia, while Bolivia—by forcing Rurelec to initiate proceedings in order to
assert its rights—has imposed a high “marginal cost” on the latter that the Tribunal should

have ordered Bolivia to cover, at least in part.

. This conclusion would have also been consistent with a basic economic principle in the

design and application of mandatory rules, including those embodied in international
treaties: it should not prove more advantageous to breach a rule than to comply with it.
Therefore, given an expropriation that has been shown to be unlawful by the full Tribunal on
the basis of the failure to pay compensation, and by me on the additional basis of a breach of

“due process”, the Tribunal should have ordered costs against Bolivia, at least partially.

. Finally, concerning CAPEX, I regret that the Tribunal, just relying on its own hunches, took

at face value statements by a party’s witness, Mr. Paz, which Bolivia’s own expert, unable

to verify them, did not deem appropriate to include in his own valuation model.

. Even if I was unable to persuade my colleagues on the points mentioned in this opinion, I

am glad that, thanks to our chairman, we were able to discuss them in a non-confrontational

manner.
