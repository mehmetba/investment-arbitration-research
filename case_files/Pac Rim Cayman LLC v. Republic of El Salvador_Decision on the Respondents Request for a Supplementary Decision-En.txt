. The Procedural History

On 14 October 2016, the Tribunal rendered the Award in the case in reference to the

Claimant and the Respondent (collectively the “Parties”).

On 22 November 2016, the ICSID Secretariat received from the Respondent a Request for
a Supplementary Decision (the “Respondent’s Request”) pursuant to Article 49(2) of the
ICSID Convention (“the ICSID Convention”) and Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules
(“the ICSID Arbitration Rules”).

On 1 December 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Respondent’s Request
in accordance with Rule 49(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and transmitted the same

to the Members of the Tribunal and the Claimant.

On 5 December 2016, the Claimant filed written observations on the Respondent’s Request

(the “Claimant’s Response’’).

On 12 December 2016, the Tribunal established the following procedural calendar:

e The Respondent may submit further written observations in answer to the
Response as soon as practicable, but no later than 19 December 2016 (the

“Respondent’s Reply”).

e The Claimant may submit written observations in answer to the Respondent’s
said observations as soon as practicable, but no later than 31 December 2016.

(the “Claimant’s Rejoinder’).

e The Tribunal shall thereafter decide upon the further procedure under ICSID
Arbitration Rule 49(3).

Each of the Parties filed its respective written observations by the due date.

PART II: THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

The Tribunal has considered in full the Parties’ written submissions, namely the
Respondent’s Request for a Supplementary Decision of the Award dated 22 November
2016, the Claimant’s Response dated 5 December 2016, the Respondent’s letter dated 19
December 2016; and the Claimant’s letter dated 31 December 2016, together with the
Tribunal’s Award of 14 October 2016.

It is nonetheless appropriate to decide the Respondent’s Request summarily, without

addressing all the submissions made by the Parties.

It is clear to the Tribunal, not least from Paragraph 3.32 of the Award, that the Respondent
was claiming post-award interest on its Legal Costs (albeit otherwise unspecified as to rate
etc). Yet, somehow, the Tribunal inadvertently overlooked this claim for post-award
interest in listing and addressing the interest issues in Paragraphs 4.13, 10.9 and 12.1(4) of

the Award.

It is equally clear to the Tribunal that, had it addressed its collective mind to the
Respondent’s claim for post-award interest, the Tribunal would have ordered post-award
interest on the Respondent’s Legal Costs. The Tribunal would also have considered that
such post-award interest should be simple interest at a reasonable compensatory rate. The
Tribunal takes public notice that 12-months US$ LIBOR is currently running at about

1.71% per annum.

As the Tribunal understands the Parties’ written submissions, it is common ground between
the Parties that the claim for post-award interest was pleaded by the Respondent and that,
if the Tribunal were to recognise an inadvertent error in not deciding such claim in the
Award (as opposed to a deliberate decision not to do so), there would be jurisdiction to
make an appropriate further decision under ICSID Arbitration Rule 49.

The Tribunal adopts the same approach to Rule 49; and it readily recognises such an

Page 3

inadvertent error. There was no deliberate intent by the Tribunal not to decide such a
claim or to decide it, sub silentio, adversely to the Respondent in the Award. Further, the
Tribunal considers the Respondent's request to have been made in a timely manner,
conforming to the requirements for a request under ICSID Arbitration Rule 49.

1.19. For these reasons, pursuant to Rule 49, the Tribunal decides to supplement and rectify its
Award by ordering the Claimant to pay simple interest on the order for Legal Costs
payable to the Respondent in the principal amount of US$ 8 million under Paragraph
12.1(4) of the Award, at the rate of an average of 12-months US$ LIBOR, as reported in
the London Financial Times, starting from the date of the Claimant’s receipt of the
Award (namely 14 October 2016) until payment to the Respondent.

1.20. In the circumstances, the Tribunal makes no order for legal or arbitration costs by
reference to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) and

49(4) or otherwise.
