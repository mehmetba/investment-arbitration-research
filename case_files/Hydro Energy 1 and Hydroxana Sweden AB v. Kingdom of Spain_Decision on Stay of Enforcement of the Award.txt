Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

BACKGROUND

This Decision addresses the request by the Kingdom of Spain (the “Respondent” or
“Spain”) for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the ICSID award rendered on
5 August 2020 in the arbitration proceeding Hydro Energy I S.a r.l. and Hydroxana
Sweden AB v Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/42 (the “Award”).

On 30 September 2020, the Applicant filed its Application for Annulment of the Award,
accompanied by Annexes 01 to 11 (the “Application for Annulment”). In its Application
for Annulment, Spain requested, among other things: (i) a provisional stay of enforcement
of the Award in accordance with ICSID Convention Article 52(5) and ICSID Arbitration
Rule 54(2); and (ii) the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award until the

Committee renders its Decision on the Application for Annulment.!

On 6 October 2020, the Secretary General of ICSID registered the Application and
informed the Parties of the provisional stay of the Award pursuant to ICSID Arbitration
Rule 54(2).

On 14 December 2020, the ad hoc Committee was constituted in accordance with Article
52(3) of the ICSID Convention. Its members are Ms. Wendy J. Miles, QC, a national of
New Zealand, President; Dr. José Antonio Moreno Rodriguez, a national of Paraguay; and
Prof. Dr. Jacomijn J. van Haersolte-van Hof, a national of The Netherlands (the

“Committee”).

On 30 December 2020, the Parties confirmed by email that they had agreed: (i) to conduct
the stay proceedings in the English language; and (ii) to extend the 30-day deadline until

the Committee has reached a final decision on the stay.

On 14 January 2021, the European Commission filed an Application for Leave to Intervene

as Non-Disputing Party in the Annulment Proceedings (the “EC Application”).

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

On 15 January 2021, the Applicant filed its Submission in Support of the Continuation of
the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Exhibits R-0005, R-0253, R-0382 to
R-0385 and Legal Authorities RL-0126 to RL-0144 (the “Submission”.

On 20 January 2021, the Committee invited the Parties to provide their observations on the

EC Application.

On 29 January 2021, Hydro Energy 1 S.a r.l. (“Hydro”) and Hydroxana Sweden
(“Hydroxana’”) (together the “Claimants”), filed their Response to Spain’s Request for a
Permanent Stay of Enforcement, together with Annex A, Exhibit C-186 and Legal
Authorities CL-159 to CL-184 (the “Response”).

On 12 February 2021, the Respondent filed its Reply in Support of the Continuation of the
Stay of Enforcement of the Award, together with Exhibit R-0386 and Legal Authorities RL-
0147 to RL-0157 (the “Reply”).

On 26 February 2021, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder to the Kingdom of Spain’s
Submission in Support of Continuing the Provisional Stay of Enforcement of the Award,

together with an Updated Annex A and Exhibits C-189 to C-194 (the “Rejoinder”).

On 3 March 2021, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1, which recorded the

Parties’ agreements and the Committee’s decisions on procedural matters.

Section II of this Decision summarize the Parties’ positions regarding the continuation of
the stay of enforcement of the Award. Section III sets out the reasons for the Committee’s

decision. The Committee’s decision and orders are recorded in Section IV.
THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS
7) The Kingdom of Spain

The Kingdom of Spain’s starting point is that “it is the prevailing practice for ICSID ad

hoc annulment committees to stay enforcement of an award during the pendency of the

Case 1:21-cv-02463-RJL Document 20-1 Filed 04/25/22 Page 10 of 207

(ICSID Case No. ARB/15/42) — Annul.

 

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

annulment proceeding”. The Kingdom of Spain then submits that “exceptional
circumstances” are required to depart from that “standard practice” or “‘norm”.? It submits
that no such circumstances exist in the current case and all circumstances “typically

considered” weigh in favour of continuing the stay.*

15. According to the Kingdom of Spain, such typically considered circumstances include
serious prejudice and harm to the Applicant in not continuing the stay, prejudice or harm
to the Claimants in continuing the stay, history of compliance by the Applicant, and/or

merits of the underlying Annulment Application.
a. Submissions on Applicable Legal Standard

16. First, the Kingdom of Spain’s position is that “it is the prevailing practice for ICSID ad

hoc annulment committees to stay enforcement of an award during the pendency of the

5

annulment proceeding”,? and that any departure from that requires the existence of

exceptional circumstances. In support of its submissions as to prevailing practice, the
Kingdom of Spain relies on statements in several stay decisions in earlier ICSID annulment

proceedings to support that position, including:

a) Occidental v Ecuador, that “[t]he prevailing practice in prior annulment cases has

been to grant the stay of enforcement”;®

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

b) Victor Pey Casado v Chile, that “absent unusual circumstances, the granting of a stay
of enforcement pending the outcome of the annulment proceedings has now become

almost automatic”;?

c) MTD v Chile, that “unless there is some indication that the annulment application is
brought without any basis under the Convention, i.e., that it is dilatory, it is not for
the Committee to assess as a preliminary matter whether or not it is likely to

succeed”:® and

d

Tenaris II v Bolivian Republic of Venezuela, that Article 52(5) “does not intend to
empower ad hoc committees to reject the request for a stay when the applicant pursues

its legitimate right to have the award examined”?

17. In its Reply, the Kingdom of Spain acknowledges that neither the ICSID Convention nor
the ICSID Rules provide specific guidance on the factors to be considered in continuing a
stay.!° Moreover, it clarifies that it was not asserting that a continuation of the stay would
be “automatic”,'' but rather that the Kingdom of Spain was not required to meet a standard
of showing “compelling” or “exceptional” circumstances in order to succeed in its

application. !?

18. In support of its submission that it need not show existence of compelling or exceptional

circumstances in support of a stay, the Kingdom of Spain relied upon several earlier

19. The Kingdom of Spain in its Reply further seeks to characterize the Claimants’ submissions
as imposing on it the burden of proof to demonstrate compelling circumstances.!* The
Kingdom of Spain denies that such a burden exists and makes clear that it does not seek to
“impose the primary burden on [the Claimants] to prove why the stay should not be
granted’. Nevertheless, it does submit that certain matters are logically for the Claimants

to demonstrate, such as whether it would suffer prejudice as a result of the stay.!°

b. Submissions on Circumstances to be Considered

20. As to the circumstances to be considered, the Kingdom of Spain identifies the following

three factors in its Submission and Reply:

1) _ the Annulment Application is well-grounded, serious, not frivolous or dilatory;
2) _ serious prejudice and harm to the Applicant if the stay is not continued; and

3) no prejudice or harm to the Claimants in continuing the stay.7°

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

1) Application well-grounded and not dilatory

As to the first factor, the Kingdom of Spain acknowledges that in previous stay decisions,
ICSID ad hoc committees have held that one of the circumstances to be considered in
determining whether or not to stay enforcement is the bona fides of the underlying
annulment application.?! Accordingly, at paragraphs 13 to 18 of Spain’s Submission, and
paragraphs 41 to 50 of Spain’s Reply, the Kingdom of Spain sets out its submissions as to
why the Annulment Application has been made in good faith and is well-grounded and not

dilatory, respectively.

First, the Kingdom of Spain submits that the Annulment Application has been made on the
following grounds, which it describes as serious and in good faith:??

.. in the Award the Tribunal went beyond its jurisdiction by failing to apply the proper

law with regard to the intra-EU objection and wrongly interpreting Article 26 of the

Energy Charter Treaty ... [and] failed to apply the proper law by completely

disregarding European Union Law when assessing the facts and merits of the case.
The Kingdom of Spain goes on to refer to three earlier ICSID ad hoc committee decisions,
which suggest that it would be inappropriate to reject a stay request when the applicant is
pursuing a legitimate right, including Victor Pey Casado v Chile, Tenaris II v Venezuela

and Perenco v Ecuador.

The Kingdom of Spain observes that it is not asking the Committee to make its ultimate
determinations on the merits of the underlying Annulment Application, but rather to accept

that it is a non-frivolous application.*

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

25. In its Reply, the Kingdom of Spain responds to the Claimants’ submissions as to the merits

of the underlying Annulment Application (summarized below) by reiterating that this is

indeed a relevant circumstance and “clearly weighs in favour of the stay”.

2) Serious prejudice and harm to Applicant if stay is not continued

26. As to the second factor, in its Submission and Reply, the Kingdom of Spain describes the
serious prejudice and harm that it submits would be suffered by it if the stay were not
continued.”° This is essentially a serious risk of non-recoupment from the Claimants if
the Annulment Application were ultimately successful and the Award annulled in whole

or part.

27. In its Submission, the Kingdom of Spain cites the ad hoc committee in MTD v Chile, that
a sovereign state “should not be exposed ...[] ... to the risk that payment made under an

award which is eventually annulled may turn out to be irrecoverable from an insolvent

claimant?"

28. In its Reply, the Kingdom of Spain provides more expansive references to earlier ad hoc
committee decisions on stay, including five recent cases against Spain: SolEs Badajoz
GmbH v Spain,?® RREEF Infrastructure (GP) Limited v Spain,?? Cube v Spain,?® Masdar
v Spain*! and NextEra v Spain.*? The Kingdom of Spain points out that the stay was not

continued in Cube, Masdar and NextEra, but was continued in SolEs Badajoz and

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

RREEF.*> In both of the latter cases, the Kingdom of Spain submits that lack of financial
resources and the risk of non-recoupment was a substantial factor. In Cube, Masdar and
NextEra, on the other hand, the Kingdom of Spain submits that either insolvency was not

alleged or there was no evidence to support the existence of a risk of non-recoupment.**

In the current case, the Kingdom of Spain submits that there is a high risk of non-
recoupment because: (i) the Claimants’ financial statements show total assets of €18.8
million, against an Award value of €30.875 million; (ii) that these financial statements
show a high risk of non-recoupment; and (iii) that the Kingdom of Spain’s previous

experience with unrelated claimants highlights the difficulty of seeking recoupment.*>
3) No prejudice or harm to the Claimants in continuing the stay

As to the third factor, in its Submission the Kingdom of Spain acknowledges that previous
ad hoc committees have considered whether the continuation of the stay would have
adverse economic consequences on the award creditor, citing Quiborax S.A. v

36

Plurinational State of Bolivia.’° However, it denies that the Claimants in the current case

would be harmed.

The Kingdom of Spain’s two primary arguments against Claimants’ harm are that it will
abide by its international obligations and that the Claimants would be entitled to payment
of interest for any deferred payment.*” In its Submission, the Kingdom of Spain asserts
that “/t/here is also no history of non-compliance”.** It notes that it takes its international

obligations seriously and has already notified the Award to the European Commission for

its State Aid assessment “thereby completing the steps that would allow its payment
promptly upon reception of the EC authorization”.*°

As to interest, the Kingdom of Spain referred to the approach followed by earlier ad hoc
committees in Caratube II v Republic of Kazakhstan” and Azurix v Argentina,*! where the
committees both noted that interest payable would adequately compensate for delay.*? The
Kingdom of Spain went on to note that the Award interest rate in the current Award is at a
rate of EURIBOR plus 1%, which is “well above the Spain 10 years Government Bonds,
which have a 0.277% yield as of [15 January 2020]”.”

c. Serious Prejudice to Applicant of Potential Conflict with EU Law

Finally, the Kingdom of Spain refers in its Submission and Reply at length to its obligations
under EU law.** At paragraph 6 of its Submission, the Kingdom of Spain includes serious
prejudice and harm caused to it by the lifting of the stay because it could result in a potential
conflict with its obligations under EU law (and in particular European Commission State

aid regulations), as one of the “cir typically idered by ICSID Annuli

 

Committees in determining requests for stays [that] weigh in favor of continuing the stay

of enforcement here”.

However, when the Kingdom of Spain sets out its detailed pleadings in respect of this
factor, it does not refer to or rely on this as a circumstance considered by other ad hoc
committees or cite a single earlier decision in support. Instead, it sets out its substantive

submissions on EU law that appear to form the basis for its Annulment Application.

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

In both its Submission and Reply, the Kingdom of Spain sets out what it describes as “a
balancing exercise”, between submitting the Award to the European Commission now for
a determination as to whether it constitutes incompatible State aid, or waiting until after
any annulment decision to do so.*> In its Reply, the Kingdom of Spain refutes the
Claimants’ argument (summarized below) that its reliance on the European Commission’s
State aid determination undermine its position on the stay, and explains that it is required
to comply with its EU law obligations.** Having argued at length that it is “committed to
seek EC approval”*’ and “not to try to block compliance”,*® the Kingdom of Spain
confirms again at paragraph 127 of its Reply (as stated earlier in its Submission, paragraph
46) that it already notified the Award to the EC on 3 September 2020,*? and further
confirms that it received EC acknowledgement of that notification on 6 November 2020,°°

and that the EC’s clearance is currently pending.*!

The Kingdom of Spain then goes on to note that “while the EC’s clearance is pending, the
Member State has a standstill obligation which prevents it [from] making any sort of

disbursement”.

(ii) The Claimants

The Claimants’ starting point is the final and binding nature of ICSID awards as set out in
Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants submit that annulment pursuant to

Article 52 is a narrow and exceptional remedy and that the “Committee must determine

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

whether circumstances are present that necessitate a stay”.> If they are, then the

Committee may exercise its discretion to grant the stay of enforcement.*

The circumstances that the Claimants submit have been taken into account by previous ad
hoc committees are: (i) existence of a dilatory motive; (ii) prospects of non-compliance by
the award debtor; (iii) evidence of hardship to the applicant; and (iv) prospects of
recoupment from the award creditor if the annulment is successful.*> The Claimant goes
on to assert in its Response and Rejoinder that the Kingdom of Spain bears the burden of

proof to demonstrate that the stay is required in this case.*°
a. Submissions on Applicable Legal Standard

In relation to the applicable legal standard, the Claimants relies on three primary points
(summarized at paragraph 10 of the Response): (i) the finality of ICSID awards and narrow
and exceptional remedy of annulment; (ii) the granting of stays in ICSID proceedings being
the exception not the rule; and (iii) the burden of proof lying with the Kingdom of Spain to

demonstrate that a stay is required in this case.

First, in relation to the finality of awards and the exceptional remedy of annulment, the
Claimants refer to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54 of the ICSID Rules
as requiring a two-stage analysis. The first is whether circumstances are present to
necessitate a stay and the second is to exercise discretion whether or not to continue the

stay if such circumstances exist.*’

In relation to finality of awards, the Claimant refers to the language of Article 53(1) of the
ICSID Convention and the ad hoc committee decisions on stays of enforcement in three

earlier annulment proceedings:

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

In order to support its submission that the remedy of annulment is narrow and exceptional,
the Claimants relied on the ad hoc committee decisions on stay of enforcement in Total v

Argentina, Burlington v Ecuador and SGS v Paraguay.’

Secondly, in relation to a stay of enforcement being the exception rather than the rule, the
Claimants referred again to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and the language therein
that the enforcement of an award may be stayed if the Committee “considers that the
circumstances so require”. In support of that proposition, the Claimants rely on the ad
hoc committee decisions on stay of enforcement in Kardassapoulos v Georgia, Antin v
Spain, Valores Mundiales v Venezuela, OI European v Venezuela and Border Timbers v

Zimbabwe”.

The Claimants focus in particular on the stay decision in Antin v Spain, and the ad hoc
committee’s observation that Article 52(5) “makes clear that a stay should be continued
only if there are circumstances requiring such a stay”.’” They further note that the Antin
committee observed that “stays may only be granted in cases where there are special or
particular circumstances that bring the case outside the run of usual annulment

applications and which compels the granting of a stay”.”

In their Rejoinder, the Claimants rebut the Kingdom of Spain’s argument that it is not
required to show that exceptional circumstances exist in order to obtain a stay of
enforcement, which the Claimants call a ‘straw man’. According to the Claimants, the
Kingdom of Spain must prove, based on objective evidence, that the circumstances so

require a stay.”

47. However, the Claimants reiterate in their Rejoinder that, in their submission, stays are an
exceptional remedy, reflecting the final and binding nature of the award and the exceptional
nature of the remedy of annulment.”? This, according to the Claimants, is the legal standard
“based on consistent ICSID case law on the point’.+ The Claimants then reiterate and

expand on their earlier discussion of the aforementioned cases to support their point.

48. Thirdly, in relation to the Kingdom of Spain bearing the burden of proof, the Claimants
submit that the language of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention “imposes the burden of
proof on Spain to establish that circumstances exist which require a stay”. The Claimants
rely on the ad hoc committee decisions on stay in Masdar v Spain, NextEra v Spain and

Karkey v Pakistan”> to support its arguments as to the burden of proof.’°

49. In their Rejoinder, the Claimants submit that the Kingdom of Spain has failed to discharge
its burden of proof and rebut its argument that the Claimant must prove that it will suffer
prejudice as a result of the stay.”” In particular, the Claimants submit that there is no such

burden on them based both on the language of the ICSID Rules and on earlier ad hoc

1.78

committee decisions on stay of enforcement.’* The Claimants relied on the decisions cited

in their Response, and responded to the Kingdom of Spain’s references to Standard
Chartered v Tanzania,” stating that the ad hoc committee in that decision on stay did not

indicate that one particular party had the burden of proof.*°

b. Submissions on Circumstances to be Considered

As to the circumstances that the Claimants submitted were taken into consideration by
previous ad hoc committees in decisions on stay, they summarized these at paragraph 47
of the Response and paragraph 37 of the Rejoinder as: (i) existence of dilatory motive; (ii)
prospects of compliance; (iii) evidence of hardship to the applicant; and (iv) prospects of
recoupment. The Claimants submit that none of these factors weighs in favour of stay of

enforcement. The Claimants’ submissions in respect of each factor is summarized below.
1) Existence of dilatory motive

From the outset, the Claimants refute the Kingdom of Spain’s submission that a stay should
be continued provided the annulment application is not dilatory or frivolous and is well-
grounded and made in good faith.*! Citing the ad hoc committee decision in Total v
Argentina in support, which observes that “/a] serious application is the least that can be
expected from an applicant’, the Claimant argues that the existence of a good faith
annulment application cannot be enough for a stay of enforcement; such circumstance
1.82

would not be unusual.** The Claimants also rely on Antin v Spain, and the observation of

the committee in that case that “/cJircumstances that are usual to most annulment

applications cannot, even if relevant, be sufficient to justify the continuation of a stay”.®

In their Rejoinder, the Claimants put this even more clearly, stating that “while a committee
may consider the frivolous or dilatory nature of an application to deny continuation of a
stay, that does not mean that a non-frivolous or non-dilatory application militates in favour
of, or creates a presumption for, a stay”.** In support of that contention, the Claimants

cited further to the following four ad hoc committee decisions on stay of enforcement:

(ICSID Case No. ARB/15/42) — Annul.

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

Total v Argentina (“the mere fact of the application for annulment being serious or not

evidently dilatory is not sufficient to continue the stay of enforcement’);

Antin v Spain (“stays may only be granted in cases where there are special or particular
circumstances that bring the case outside the run of usual annulment applications and

which compels the granting of a stay”);°°

NextEra v Spain (“save in such instances as when it could be said that the application
for annulment is manifestly frivolous or obviously unmeritorious, the merits of the
l Pi dings is not hing an ad hoc ittee should be concerned with

when determining a continuation of a provisional stay”);*" and

Cube v Spain (“rather than forming a requirement that must be demonstrated positively,

oS

the absence of good faith or the dilatory nature of the application serves to rebut a

request for a stay”).°8

The Claimants then proceed to make the affirmative argument that the Kingdom of Spain’s
application is indeed manifestly frivolous, both in respect of its intra~-EU jurisdiction
argument and its claims regarding applicable law.*? In support of its submission that the
intra-EU argument is frivolous, the Claimants refer to the fact that “the ‘intra-EU’
jurisdictional objection has been raised in no less than 55 other arbitration cases,
including 22 involving Spain”. As to the applicable law arguments, the Claimants argue
that the Kingdom of Spain’s arguments are contradictory in that it claims that the tribunal

failed to apply EU law and, at the same time, grossly or egregiously misapplied EU law.°!

In their Rejoinder, the Claimants submit that the Kingdom of Spain has not addressed these

and that its arguments as to applicable law are contradictory.
2) Prospects of compliance

As to prospects of compliance, the Claimants refer the Committee to the Kingdom of
Spain’s alleged “undisputed history of non-compliance with other awards pending against
if’, refusal to provide undertakings to other ad hoc committees and its position that
compliance with the Award is conditional (in relation to its European Commission State

aid arguments).

As to non-payment of ICSID awards against it, the Claimants included a table of 14 cases,
which they argue demonstrate its position in relation to the Kingdom of Spain’s

compliance. The complete table is reproduced below:**

the Kingdom of Spain’s position that its payment of the Award amount will be subject to
approval under internal EU law processes. The Claimants describe this as an “express
refusal ... to comply” and in itself “sufficient to dismiss Spain’s Stay Application”.°’ In
this regard, the Claimants referred to an earlier ad hoc committee decision in Micula v
Romania, where the committee considered a similar argument by Romania to be evidence
of a “probable risk”, and imposed conditions on the stay of enforcement accordingly.”
The Claimants further referred to earlier cases involving alleged conflicting internal
processes with compliance with an award, including Total v Argentina, Sempra v
Argentina, OI European v Venezuela, Tenaris v Venezuela and Valores Mundiales v

Venezuela.

58. In their Rejoinder, the Claimants submit that the Kingdom of Spain does not refute that it
has not yet paid any of the aforementioned awards, but instead argues that non-payment of
this particular award cannot reflect a history of non-compliance, and that every case is
different.°? The Claimants further submit that the Kingdom of Spain’s submissions in

submissions, also focus primarily on risk of non-recoupment. In that respect, they submit
that the Claimant entities have total assets of approximately EUR 18 million, and are

substantial companies that are solvent with access to capital. !°?

In response to the Kingdom of Spain’s submissions as to the lack of sense in money passing
backwards and forwards between the Parties, the Claimants refer to the decision in Cube v
Spain, which stated that “/g/eneral considerations that not continuing a stay might result

in money to pass back and forth are not sufficient ...”.!

In their Rejoinder, the Claimants responded specifically to the Kingdom of Spain’s reliance
on earlier ad hoc committee decisions on stay of enforcement in So/Es Badajoz GmbH v
Spain and RREEF Infrastructure (GP) Limited v Spain, where the decision was taken to
continue the stays. The Claimants submit that in both of those cases, the claimants had not
offered any risk mitigation by way of escrow or other security. The Claimants observe that
this is not the case here, where it has proposed security “precisely to alleviate the concerns

identified” by those committees. '°

Finally in relation to risk of harm to the Kingdom of Spain, the Claimants observe in their
Rejoinder that any perceived risk that proceeds of any award enforcement will be moved
throughout the Claimants’ corporate entities is hypothetical, and alleviated by the proposed

undertakings. !°5

The Claimants submit that the payment of interest does not adequately compensate this

Award’s finality” (relying on Antin v Spain),'°’ and that it does not adequately compensate

for “uncertainty, delay and deprivation” (relying on NextEra v Spain and Cube v Spain).'°°

In relation to the Kingdom of Spain’s submissions as to the adequacy of interest in light of

The Claimants submit that the Kingdom of Spain’s EU law arguments are wrong because
the Award is not State aid. In particular, it is not State aid because it fails to meet any of
the four necessary conditions for State aid requiring notification under the TFEU.!!! Those
conditions are, the Claimants submit, that the measure must confer an economic advantage,
be granted selectively, from State resources and distort competition and affect trade

case.!!3

Finally, the Claimants contend that any discussion as to whether or not the Kingdom of

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

THE COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS
7) Applicable Legal Standard

Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that the ad hoc committee “may, if it
considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its
decision”. The Article 52(5) standard is two-fold: (i) the Committee has a discretion to
stay of enforcement of the Award and (ii) it is permitted (but not required) to exercise that

discretion where it considers that the circumstances in the current case so require.

Both Parties have relied extensively on earlier ad hoc committee decisions on stay of
enforcement in order to support their respective arguments as to the “prevailing” legal
standard. The Kingdom of Spain, citing to a number of earlier decisions, contends that the
prevailing standard is automatically to stay enforcement absent exceptional circumstances.
Although the Claimants’ starting point is that there is no prevailing practice because the
ICSID Convention requires an ad hoc committee to consider the specific circumstances of
the case before it, they go on to contend that there must be compelling reasons for a stay

of enforcement, citing to a number of earlier decisions in support.

The Parties’ competing legal standards — on the one hand to stay unless exceptional
circumstances and on the other hand to stay only in the event of compelling circumstances
— necessarily lead to opposite presumptive starting points. These, in turn, would shift the
burden of proof: the Kingdom of Spain considers it to be for the Claimants to furnish proof
of exceptional circumstances to lift the temporary stay, whereas the Claimants consider it
to be for the Kingdom of Spain to furnish proof of compelling circumstances to stay

enforcement.

For the reasons explained below, the Committee is not persuaded by either party’s
submissions as to prevailing legal standards, and does not accept that there is a presumption
either in favour of or against a stay of enforcement. Instead, the Committee is guided by
the language of Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and other relevant parts of the
ICSID Convention and Rules.

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

First, the Committee is of the view that the existence of a provisional stay of the Award
pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Rules does not create any presumption in favour of a

stay of enforcement pursuant to Article 52(5). Rule 54(2) provides as follows:

(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a

stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of

registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the

Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30

days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay,

it shall automatically be terminated.
Rule 54(2) has automatic and mandatory effect: if the annulment application contains a
request for stay, the Secretary-General shall inform the parties of the provisional stay of
the award. However, the scope of that provisional stay is limited: it automatically
terminates unless, within 30 days of the constitution of the committee a party requests its

continuation and the committee decides to continue the stay.

Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, by contrast, is discretionary in nature. It requires
consideration of such circumstances as may merit in favour of or against the grant of a stay

of enforcement. The circumstances to be considered are dealt with below.

Secondly, the Committee does not accept that the existence of a final award pursuant to
Rule 53(1) of the ICSID Convention necessarily creates any presumption against a stay of
enforcement pursuant to Article 52(5). The Committee notes that Article 52(5) is contained
in Section 5 of the ICSID Convention, dealing with ‘Interpretation, Revision and
Annulment of the Award’. The Convention provisions dealing with matters requiring
further steps in respect of an award precede those dealing with the award’s finality and
ensuing effect. Section 6 ‘Recognition and Enforcement of the Award’, which includes

Article 53(1), follows the section dealing with factors that potentially qualify that finality.

In that regard, the Claimants place considerable emphasis on the binding and final nature

of awards, as set out in Article 53(1), which provides that:

(ICSID Case No. ARB/15/42) — Annul:

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to

any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide

by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall

have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention. [Emphasis

added.]
It is somewhat circular to argue that Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention sets a
presumption of finality for an ad hoc committee in considering a stay application, when

Article 53(1) itself expressly provides that such finality will be subject to any stay.

Therefore, the Committee is satisfied that the ICSID Convention establishes neither a
presumption in favour nor a presumption against granting a stay of enforcement. As to the
prevailing practice, the Committee makes two observations. First, there does not appear
to be any one ‘prevailing practice’. Each party has presented geographic and/or temporal
snapshots of groups of cases in a manner that supports its respective point. The Parties’
ability to find support for opposite positions demonstrates that there is no single ‘prevailing
practice’ across the body of earlier ad hoc committee decisions on stay of enforcement.
Secondly, given the language of Article 52(5), the only relevant prevailing practice is that
each ad hoc committee in each case must make its own determination on the basis of the
circumstances in the particular case. That is indeed the approach that the Committee has

determined it will follow.

As to the burden of proof, if either party relies on the existence of a circumstance to support
the grant or refusal of a stay, respectively, that party must provide evidence in support of
that circumstance and establish how it militates in favour of (or against) a stay of
enforcement in the current case. In turn, it will be for the opposing party, where relevant,

to rebut that evidence.

(ii) The Circumstances to be Considered

The Parties in this case have raised three separate circumstances to be considered in relation
to the stay, which the Committee considers to be relevant to its decision. These include:

(a) harm to the Kingdom of Spain in lifting the stay of enforcement; (b) harm to the

Claimant in granting the stay of enforcement; and (c) existence of dilatory motive in the
underlying annulment application. Both Parties provided additional submissions as to the
effect and/or relevance of EU law, in the Kingdom of Spain’s case, at least partly, as part
of its case on hardship to it if no stay is granted. The Committee will address EU law

separately below.

a. Harm to the Kingdom of Spain if no Stay of Enforcement

The first factor that the Committee considers to be relevant to its decision whether or not
to grant a stay of enforcement in this case is the harm or hardship likely to be suffered by

the Kingdom of Spain if a stay were not granted.

The Kingdom of Spain identifies this harm as the prejudice it would suffer as a
consequence being unable to recoup monies from the Claimants if the Annulment
Application were ultimately successful and the Award annulled in whole or part. The
Kingdom of Spain acknowledges that in order for this risk of harm to exist, there must be
a valid concern as to the Claimants’ ability or willingness to repay in the event of
annulment. In that regard, it relies on the Claimants’ financial statements. Those financial
statements disclose total assets of €18.8 million, consisting primarily of equity interests in

the hydro plants in Spain. Those assets fall short of the €30.875 Award damages amount.

The Kingdom of Spain referred to a number of earlier ad hoc decisions where the stay was
continued due to risk of exposure to inability to recover from an insolvent claimant,
including MTD v Chile, SolEs Badajoz GmbH v Spain and RREEF Infrastructure (GP)
Limited v Spain. In relation to three recent decisions where no stay of enforcement was
granted, the Kingdom of Spain acknowledged that either insolvency was not alleged or
there was no evidence to support the existence of a risk of non-recoupment (Cube v Spain,

Masdar v Spain and NextEra v Spain).

The Claimants in the current case are not insolvent; they are operational and appear to have

almost €20 million in assets.

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

Other than the financial statements evidencing the shortfall between the Claimants’ non-
cash assets and the Award damages amount, there is no additional evidence that supports
the existence of risk of non-recoupment as a result of insolvency if the Award were

annulled.

As to any apparent financial statement shortfall, the Claimants offered to alleviate any
concerns in this respect by either holding any recovered funds in escrow or providing a
binding and unconditional undertaking to repay any recovered monies in the event that the

Annulment Application is successful.

To that end, as noted by the Claimants, in the decisions to stay enforcement by both ad hoc
committees in SolEs Badajoz GmbH v Spain and RREEF Infrastructure (GP) Limited v
Spain, the claimants had not offered any risk mitigation by way of escrow or other security.
That is not the case here; the Claimants have indeed proposed security in order to alleviate

the concerns identified by the ad hoc committees in SolEs and RREEF.

The Kingdom of Spain alludes to further circumstances that may lead to harm, including
but not limited to potential sale of the Award or movement of Award proceeds through the
Claimants’ corporate entities which risk putting these out of reach for any recoupment. As
these are circumstances upon which the Kingdom of Spain seeks affirmatively to rely, it is
for the Kingdom of Spain to provide evidence in support. It has not done so and, instead,
raises both risks as hypothetical. Even if they were actual risks, they too would be

alleviated by the Claimants’ proposed undertakings.

For the reasons outlined above, including the Claimants’ offer of an undertaking, the
Committee does not consider that there are circumstances of harm or likely harm to the
Kingdom of Spain in the current case that require a stay of enforcement arising out of risk

of non-recoupment from the Claimants.

b. Harm to the Claimants in Granting the Stay

The second factor that the Committee considers to be relevant to its decision whether or
not to grant a stay of enforcement in this case is the harm or hardship likely to be suffered

by the Claimants if the stay were continued.

The Kingdom of Spain acknowledges that a stay can create adverse economic
consequences for an award creditor (such as in Quiborax S.A. v Plurinational State of
Bolivia), but that it does not in the current case because Spain would abide by its
international obligations and the Claimants would be entitled to interest for any deferred
payment under the Award. In relation to that interest, the Kingdom of Spain refers to the
Award rate of interest (EURIBOR plus 1%) as being well above the Spain 10-year

government bonds as evidence of no adverse economic consequence.

The Claimants do not accept that interest is an adequate antidote for stay of enforcement
of the Award pending the annulment decision. They also do not accept that the economic
adequacy of the interest rate should be measured in light of the negative yield on Spanish

government bonds.

A final and binding arbitral award is an asset. It is an instrument of value and that value is
measured by its enforceability. An award that is subject to a stay cannot be enforced and
that inevitably will have an impact on its value. As the Claimants have submitted, the
purpose of post-award interest is to compensate for non-payment of the Award damages.
But once compensatory post-award interest has become payable, the award creditor has
already suffered adverse consequences as a result of delayed recovery. Although interest
would go some way toward financially compensating the Claimants based on the time
value of money, it would not remedy the Claimants’ inability to choose how to apply those
monies in their own discretion (as the Claimants put it, placing them in the position of

“effectively being forced to loan money to Spain’).'?°

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

Similarly, the ad hoc committees in NextEra v Spain and Cube v Spain have both observed

that interest does not adequately compensate for “uncertainty, delay and deprivation”.'*!

The adequacy of interest as a remedy for a stay of enforcement is further dependent upon

the likelihood that the Award will be voluntarily complied with (if not annulled).

In that respect, the Kingdom of Spain affirmatively asserts that it has “no history of non-
compliance” with arbitral awards. This is unpersuasive. The Claimants have identified at
least 14 outstanding arbitral awards against the Kingdom of Spain, only five of which
(including the current case) are currently subject to a provisional or continued stay. Whilst
the Committee is primarily concerned about the risk of the Kingdom of Spain’s non-
compliance with the current Award, as opposed to its history of compliance or non-
compliance in respect of other unrelated awards, it must accept that there is a real risk, as
identified by the Claimants, that they will be “pushed to the back of a long line of award-

creditors” |

Moreover, the position of the Kingdom of Spain in notifying the Award to the European
Commission for State aid assessment, and its confirmation that it will not comply with the
Award until or unless it receives European Commission pre-authorization to do so, is
inconsistent with its position in relation to its intention to comply with the current Award.
It emphasizes its intention to rely on its international obligations but, at the same time,
maintains that those obligations are subject to the decision of the European Commission
under EU law. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Spain has applied to annul the Award precisely
on the grounds that the Tribunal allegedly failed to apply or misapplied EU law.

The Claimants describe this argument as defeating the Kingdom of Spain’s request for a
stay and as being an express refusal to comply with its obligations under the Award that is
itself sufficient to dismiss the stay application. The Committee does not agree that the

Kingdom of Spain’s arguments go quite that far. It appears to confirm that, if it were to

receive European Commission authorization, it would proceed to pay the Award amount.
This, according to the Kingdom of Spain, would constitute compliance with its
international law obligations. However, the assertion that it will not pay the Award amount
insofar as it is incompatible with EU law does somewhat undermine the Kingdom of

Spain’s assurances in respect of compliance.

Previous ad hoc committee decisions have considered conditions to compliance in the
context of stay of enforcement applications. In Micula v Romania, the committee
considered a similar argument by Romania to be evidence of a “probable risk’, and

imposed conditions on the stay.'>

Earlier cases involving alleged conflicting internal
processes with compliance with an award, such as Sempra v Argentina, led to a similar
outcome. !*4 In other cases, including Total v Argentina, Sempra v Argentina, OI European

i

v Ve la, Tenaris v Ve and Valores Mundiales v Ve la, the committee

rejected the request to continue the stay of enforcement (or, in one case, imposed

conditions). !?°

For the reasons outlined above, the Committee does consider that there are circumstances
of harm or likely harm to the Claimants in the current case that militate against a stay of
enforcement arising out of risk of uncertainty, delay and deprivation that cannot adequately

be compensated by interest.

c. Existence of Dilatory Motive

The third factor that the Committee considers to be relevant to its decision whether or not
to grant a stay of enforcement in this case is the existence of dilatory motive in the

underlying annulment application (lack of merit).

In relation to the merits of the underlying Annulment Application, there was some
disagreement between the Parties as to the starting presumption, if any, from which to
examine those merits. The Kingdom of Spain asserted that the Annulment Application has
been made in good faith and is well-grounded and not dilatory. The Claimants submitted
in response that a ‘serious’ annulment application is not enough, in itself, to warrant a stay
of enforcement. It is not clear that this was ever the Kingdom of Spain’s position, as
opposed to it seeking to pre-empt the Claimants’ later argument that its Annulment

Application was indeed dilatory and without merit.

In any event, the Committee accepts that the fact that an annulment application is not
dilatory is not in itself sufficient circumstance to require a stay of enforcement. The
Committee notes that the ad hoc committee in Total v Argentina similarly observed in this
respect that “/a/ serious application is the least that can be expected from an applicant”!
and the committee in Antin v Spain, noted that “/cJircumstances that are usual to most
annulment applications cannot, even if relevant, be sufficient to justify the continuation of

astay”.27

However, as the Claimants further observed, an ad hoc committee may consider the
frivolous or dilatory nature of an annulment application as a circumstance that might
militate against granting a stay of enforcement. This would bring the case outside the
circumstances that are usual to most annulment applications, referred to by the ad hoc

committee in Antin v Spain.

108.

109.

110.

111.

112.

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

The Claimants did put forward an affirmative case that the Kingdom of Spain’s annulment
application is indeed manifestly frivolous, both in respect of its intra~-EU jurisdiction
argument and its claims regarding applicable law. Among other things, the Claimants
referred to the intra-EU jurisdiction argument being raised in 55 previous cases and failing

on each occasion (including in 14 cases against Spain).

Be that as it may, this Committee is required to determine whether or not to grant a stay of

enforcement based on the circumstances.

As to the current case, the Committee is not in a position to determine at this time that the
Kingdom of Spain’s intra-EU or applicable law arguments are frivolous. It does not have
full submissions in respect of those arguments and they indeed lie at the heart of the
Annulment Application. That application will be determined following full hearing of both
Parties in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the ICSID Rules and the ICSID

Convention.

For the reasons outlined above, the Committee does consider that there are circumstances
arising out of an alleged dilatory motive by the Kingdom of Spain that would militate
against a stay of enforcement. Equally, the Committee does not consider that the fact ofa
non-dilatory annulment application would, in itself, suffice to amount to circumstances

requiring a stay.
d. Relevance of EU Law to the Stay of Enforcement Decision

Finally, as noted above, the Kingdom of Spain alludes to serious prejudice and harm caused
to it by the lifting of the stay because it could result in a potential conflict with its
obligations under EU law, in particular European Commission State aid regulations. The

Kingdom of Spain describes that as one of the circumstances “typically considered” as

113.

114.

115.

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

weighing in favour of a stay of enforcement, without giving any previous instance of such

a case. !?8

The Kingdom of Spain’s central tenet on EU law in respect of the stay application appears
to be that it would be prejudiced if it were to submit the Award to the European
Commission now, for a determination as to whether it constitutes incompatible State aid,
as opposed to waiting until after the decision on the Annulment Application. However, the
Kingdom of Spain has confirmed that it has already notified the Award, so this does not

appear to be a relevant consideration.

The Kingdom of Spain’s reference to the existence of an EU law standstill obligation
pending European Commission clearance again potentially puts into issue the substantive
grounds in its Annulment Application in the application for a stay of enforcement. In
particular, it requires the Committee to engage in a balancing of the relative merits of EU
law compliance requirements and ICSID compliance requirements. It would be premature
for the Committee to make any determination in respect of those substantive grounds at
this time, prior to the Parties having fully pleaded their respective positions in accordance

with Procedural Order No. | and the ICSID Convention and Rules.

This is further reinforced by the nature of the Claimants’ response to the Kingdom of
Spain’s EU law arguments, which they submit are wrong because the Award is not State
aid. Again, these are matters for the Annulment Application, not the current application to
stay enforcement. The Claimants’ further submit that EU law is irrelevant for determining
the application for stay of enforcement because the Committee’s mandate is derived from
the ICSID Convention (and ECT) and not EU law. In this regard, the Claimants referred
to ad hoc committee decisions in Antin v Spain, Cube v Spain, NextEra v Spain and

Masdar v Spain.'?°

120.

Decision on Stay of Enforcement of the Award

Each of those decisions recognised the potential conflict between Spain’s obligations under
EU law and its obligations under the ICSID Convention, but did not accept that such
conflict could constitute a circumstance requiring a stay of enforcement. This Committee
takes the same position in relation to the current stay application, based on the
circumstances of the current case as presented to it in the Parties’ respective submissions

to date.

At the end of the day, it would be the underlying Award that potentially gave rise to any
conflict. Insofar as there is a conflict, it therefore already existed as a consequence of the
Award. This has been alluded to in the Kingdom of Spain’s Annulment Application; that
submission will be dealt with in the annulment proceedings, conducted in accordance with

Procedural Order No. 1, the ICSID Rules and the ICSID Convention.

For the purpose of the decision whether or not to grant a stay of enforcement, this
Committee is limited to circumstances of this case requiring a stay. It is not the purpose
of a stay of enforcement to remedy a potential conflict between the Kingdom of Spain’s
EU law obligations and its obligations under the ICSID Convention. Among other things,
as noted in Cube v Spain, a stay would be temporary; ultimately it would not resolve the

ill that concerns the Kingdom of Spain.

e. Whether Security Should be Ordered

Specifically in order to alleviate any risk of harm to the Kingdom of Spain arising out of
the Claimants’ financial position affecting its ability to recoup, the Claimants offered to
hold any recovered funds in escrow or to provide a binding and unconditional undertaking

to repay those monies in the event that the Annulment Application is successful.

Whilst this Committee finds no circumstances of harm or likely harm to the Kingdom of
Spain in the current case that require a stay of enforcement arising out of risk of non-
recoupment from the Claimants, that finding is predicated on the Claimants’ offer to

provide security in respect of any recovered monies.

121. Therefore, the Committee considers that such security would be appropriate, in the form
of a binding and unconditional undertaking to repay those monies in the event that the

Annulment Application is successful, as offered.

Iv. DECISIONS AND ORDERS

122. For the reasons stated above, the Committee:
a. decides that the stay of enforcement of the Award should not be continued;

b. requires the Claimants, on or before 30 April 2021, to provide a binding and
unconditional undertaking to repay any monies recovered in the event that the

Annulment Application is successful in the following terms:

Hydro Energy 1 S.ar.1. and Hydroxana Sweden AB (the “Hydro Parties”) hereby
confirm that they undertake to promptly repay the Kingdom of Spain any and all
amounts received in satisfaction of the Award rendered on 5 August 2020 (the
“Award’) to the extent that the annulment application is successful. The Hydro
Parties further confirm that they undertake not to disburse or transfer any amounts
received in satisfaction of the Award to their investors or to any other third party
while the annulment proceeding is ongoing (or thereafter to the extent the
annulment application is successful)[;]'*°

c. reserves the issue of costs on this Application to a further order or decision.
