RELEVANT LEGAL PROVISIONS

Claimant commenced these proceedings against Ecuador by Notice of Arbitration dated
21 September 2011 pursuant to Article VI of the Treaty between the United States of
America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal

Protection of Investment (the “US-Ecuador BIT”, “BIT”, or “Treaty”).

Article VI of the BIT provides:

1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a
national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment
agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment
authorization granted by that Party’s foreign investment authority to such national or
company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with
respect to an investment.

2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a
resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled
amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under
one of the following alternatives, for resolution:

Partial Award on Jurisdiction
Page 5 of 58

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute;
or

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement
procedures; or

(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.

(a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for
resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the
date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to
consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding
arbitration:

(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(“Centre”) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington,
March 18, 1965 (“ICSID Convention”), provided that the Party is a party to
such Convention; or

(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or

(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or

(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration
rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.

(b) once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the
dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the
consent.

Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement
by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of
the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written
consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the
requirement for:

(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for Purposes of Chapter II of the
ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional
Facility Rules; and

(b) an “agreement in writing” for purposes of Article II of the United Nations
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done
at New York, June 10, 1958 (“New York Convention”).

Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a
state that is a party to the New York Convention.

Til. BACKGROUND
Factual background of the dispute

5. This

objection based on Article VI of the BIT, but does not represent findings of fact.

section contextualises the decision of the Tribunal on the Respondent's jurisdictional

   

6. Following a bidding process in 1985, Ecuador and a consortium of oil companies led by
Conoco Ecuador Limited (“Conoco”) entered into a Service Contract for the Exploration and
Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 16 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (“Service
Contract”). The consortium consisted of Conoco, Overseas Petroleum and Investment
Corporation, Diamond Shamrock South America Petroleum B.V., and Nomeco Latin
American Inc. (“Consortium”).” The Service Contract assigned Respondent ownership of

the oil produced and the Consortium a set fee for the oil extraction.”>

7. Claimant’s subsidiaries acquired a 20% aggregate interest in the Service Contract in 1987.
Conoco assigned 10% of its rights and obligations under the Service Contract to each of
Murphy Ecuador Oil Company Limited (“Murphy Ecuador”), a company from Bermuda,*
and its immediate parent company, Canam Offshore Limited (“Canam”), a company from

the Bahamas’ that was wholly owned by Claimant.’

8. In December 1996, the Consortium and Ecuador executed the Modification of the Service
Contract into a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons
(Crude Oil) in Block 16 of the Amazon Region of Ecuador (“Participation Contract”).’

The Participation Contract, which was intended to remain in force until 31 January 2012,

allocated a percentage of oil production to the Consortium and authorised it to market its

share.” Claimant's subsidiaries had a 20% stake in this contract.”
9. In the early 2000s, global oil prices rose sharply.

10. On 25 April 2006, Ecuador amended its Hydrocarbons Law and passed Law 42.'' Law 42
obliged the Consortium to pay an “additional participation” of at least 50% of the difference
between the actual monthly average price of oil and the price as of the date of the
Participation Contract.'* Decree No. 1672, a regulatory decree issued in July 2006, set the
additional participation at 50%.'* This percentage was increased to 99% by Decree No. 662,

which was issued in October 2007.'*

11. In December 2007, Ecuador enacted the Tax Equity Law that applied to all new or modified
contracts issued on | January 2008 and after.'> This law created a 70% tax on profits from oil
sales that would apply only when a reference price, on which each oil company and Ecuador
had to agree, was exceeded.'° Respondent contends that the high reference rates negotiated
by the oil companies and the lower assessment rate provided for by the Tax Equity Law

effectively tempered the effect of Decree No. 662.'7

12. Claimant contends that it and the other Consortium members sought to enforce the original
terms of the Participation Contract, but made Law 42 payments under protest for a time. It
quantifies its share of these payments at USD118 million.'* Ecuador contends that Claimant
became the sole dissenting member of the Consortium with regard to the continuance of

operations in Block 16.'°

13. On 29 February 2008, Claimant notified Ecuador of its intention to submit the dispute
between the Parties on Law 42 to arbitration.” It also contended that the six-month notice

period required by Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT expired in or around October 2006.7!

Procedural history of the ICSID proceedings

14. In March 2008, Claimant initiated ICSID proceedings under the Treaty (“ICSID
Arbitration”).” Shortly thereafter, Murphy Ecuador, together with the other Consortium
members, initiated a separate ICSID arbitration relating to the same facts (“Murphy

Ecuador ICSID Arbitration”).”*

15. Claimant alleged that, after May 2008, Respondent forced investors to convert their
participation contracts to new service contracts or risk the termination of their contracts and
the abandonment of their investments.* On 12 March 2009, therefore, Claimant sold its
interest in the Participation Contract, i.e., its entire equity interest in Murphy Ecuador, to the
Consortium’s operator, which was Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. by then.” Claimant states that
it did so at a substantially diminished value and exclusive of the USD118 million in Law 42

payments it had made under protest.° Respondent contends that Claimant suffered no loss.”’

16. The Parties fully pleaded their cases on both jurisdiction and the merits in the ICSID

Arbitration, which lasted approximately three and a half years.

17. On 3 July 2009, Respondent denounced the ICSID Convention.

18. On 15 December 2010, a majority of the tribunal in the ICSID Arbitration found that it did
not have jurisdiction over the dispute (“ICSID Award on Jurisdiction”). Claimant states

that:

[The tribunal] rejected all of Ecuador’s remaining objections to jurisdiction by finding that they
were not questions of jurisdiction but should only be considered during the merits phase.
Thus...the only bar to a new tribunal’s having jurisdiction over the present dispute was the
majority’s finding that Murphy had not consulted and negotiated with Ecuador for a six-month
period before filing for arbitration.”°

 

19. Ecuador alleges that the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, agreed to withdraw its
claims in the Murphy Ecuador ICSID Arbitration with prejudice in exchange for a
Modification Contract to the Participation Contract that would convert the latter to a service

30

contract.” This settlement was reached on 23 November 2010."!

20. By letter dated 30 December 2010, Murphy invited Ecuador to participate in consultations

and negotiations regarding their dispute under the Treaty,*” to which Ecuador responded by
letter dated 31 January 2011 stating, inter alia, that the “six-month period [prescribed by

Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT] begins to run only from January 3, 2011."

21. Between February and July 2011, the Parties exchanged correspondence and conducted a

meeting, but were unable to resolve their dispute.*

22. On 13 July 2011, Murphy filed a second Request for Arbitration with ICSID, to which
Ecuador objected on jurisdictional grounds. On 19 August 2011, Murphy withdrew the said

request without prejudice.»

Procedural history of the present proceedings

23. By a Notice of Arbitration dated 21 September 2011, Claimant commenced these proceedings

against Ecuador under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976.

24. On 14 March 2012, Claimant appointed Professor Kaj Hobér (of Mannheimer Swartling
Advokatbyra, Norrlandsgaten 21, Stockholm, Sweden) as arbitrator. On 12 April 2012,
Ecuador appointed Professor Georges Abi-Saab (of 14 Chemin de St. Georges, Clarens,
Switzerland) as arbitrator. On 25 May 2012, Professors Hobér and Abi-Saab jointly
appointed Professor Bernard Hanotiau (of Hanotiau & van den Berg, 480 Avenue Louise, B9,

Brussels, Belgium) as Presiding Arbitrator.
25. The Parties and the Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment on 3 September 2012.

26. The Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which formalised a partial procedural timetable

in accordance with a procedural teleconference held on 19 July 2012.

27. On 17 September 2012, Claimant filed a Statement of Claim (“Statement of Claim”)
accompanied by (1) the first witness statement of Mr. Ignacio Herrera; (2) the expert report of
Dr. Hernan Pérez Loose with annexes; (3) the expert report of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA
with attachments; and (4) exhibits CEX-1 to CEX-167 and legal authorities CLA-001 to
CLA-108. Claimant dispatched relevant Spanish translations on 15 October 2012, along with
English translations of selected documents and a corrected Statement of Claim, Errata Sheet,

and missing exhibits (including CEX-168).

28. On 18 October 2012, Ecuador submitted its Objections to Jurisdiction (“Objections to
Jurisdiction”) accompanied by exhibits REX-1 to REX-33 and legal authorities RLA-1 to
RLA-194. On 23 October 2012, Ecuador submitted a revised version of its Objections to
Jurisdiction (to correct minor errors) and an errata sheet. Relevant Spanish translations were

submitted on 15 November 2012.

29. Accompanying its Objections to Jurisdiction was a request by Respondent that the Tribunal
“bifurcate these proceedings and address in a preliminary fashion the serious jurisdictional
issues hereto raised so that they can be separately assessed and resolved at the outset of this

9936

dispute.

On 16 November 2012, Claimant filed its Response to Respondent’s Objections to
Jurisdiction (“Claimant’s Response”) accompanied by exhibits CEX-169 to CEX-192 and
legal authorities CLA-109 to CLA-232, and opposed Respondent’s request for bifurcation. It

provided a Spanish translation of its submissions on 15 December 2012.

On 17 November 2012, the Tribunal proposed that the issue of bifurcation be resolved
without Professor Abi-Saab, who would be unable to fulfil his arbitral obligations from the

week of 19 November 2012 to March 2013 for medical reasons.

On 10 and 13 December 2012, respectively, Respondent and Claimant agreed that the

Presiding Arbitrator alone would decide on Respondent’s request for bifurcation.

On 19 December 2012, the Presiding Arbitrator issued his Decision on Respondent’s Request
for Bifurcation (“Bifurcation Decision”), in which he directed that the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection based on Article VI of the Treaty be determined in a preliminary
phase. Subject to the outcome of this phase, the remaining jurisdictional objections were to
be joined with the merits. The Bifurcation Decision further established a timetable for the
preliminary phase and scheduled a jurisdictional hearing for 21 and 22 May 2013. The
Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) provided the Parties with a Spanish translation of

the Bifurcation Decision on 14 January 2013.

On 21 January 2013, Ecuador submitted a Reply to Claimant’s Response (“Respondent’s
Reply”) accompanied by the expert opinion of Professor Kenneth Vandevelde with exhibits

1-15 and the witness statement of Dra. Christel Gaibor Flor, with an English translation.

On 20 March 2013, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“Claimant’s Rejoinder’”)
with exhibits CEX-193 to CEX-198 and legal authorities CLA-233 to CLA-267,
accompanied by the second witness statement of Mr. Ignacio Herrera and the expert report of

Professor Steven R. Ratner with accompanying exhibits 1 to 27.

On 21 to 22 May 2013, a hearing on jurisdiction was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague,
the Netherlands.

On 11 July 2013, the Parties submitted their respective Statements of Costs.

38. By e-mail of 20 September 2013, Claimant submitted to the Tribunal the award in Dede v.
Romania issued on 5 September 2013, accompanied by brief arguments in support of its case
on jurisdiction. By e-mail dated 27 September 2013, Respondent submitted comments in

response.*”

Iv. SUMMARIES OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON RESPONDENT’S
JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION UNDER ARTICLE VI(3) OF THE US-
ECUADOR BIT

39. What follows are summaries of the Parties’ positions on the issues raised by Respondent’ s
Jurisdictional Objection under Article VI(3) of the US-Ecuador BIT, without prejudice to the

full legal arguments that have been put before—and fully considered by—the Tribunal.
40. Article VI of the BIT is set out in full at paragraph 4 supra.

Treaty interpretation

41. The Parties agree that Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(“Convention”), which states that: “A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of

138

its object and purpose,”*” governs the interpretation of Article VI(3) of the BIT.

Ordinary meaning of Article VI(3)

A. Respondent’s Position

42. Respondent contends that the choices of arbitral fora listed in Article VI(3)(a) of the US-
Ecuador BIT are exclusive and irrevocable.*” It argues that the “or” in this provision

delineates alternatives,“” and explains that “or” denotes equivalence only when it connects

synonyms or substitutes,*’ which the arbitral fora enumerated in Article VI(3)(a) are not.”

The inclusion of “choose” in the provision confirms this interpretation.“*

43. Article VI(3)(a), therefore, authorises only one choice among ICSID, the ICSID Additional
Facility, UNCITRAL, or an agreed arbitration institution.” Because Article VI(2) of the BIT
offers exclusive and irrevocable choices with regard to the mode of dispute resolution,**

Respondent characterises Article VI(3)(a) as a “fork-within-a-fork.”°

44. Respondent contends that assigning a conjunctive meaning to “or” in Article VI(3)(a) would
lead to multiple “agreements in writing,” in violation of the New York Convention to which
Article VI(4)(b) of the BIT refers.*” It would also allow investors to consent to more than one
arbitral forum, which would effectively give the host State—and not the investor, as intended

by the Parties—the right to select the forum.**

45. Respondent cites the following in support of its position: authority stating that “or” typically
conveys an exclusive choice;” linguistics scholarship cautioning against presuming the
inclusive definition of “or;”*? and commentary on Article 24(3) of the 2004 US Model BIT

that states that the selection of a dispute settlement forum forecloses options initially open to

the parties.*' Respondent stresses that Article 24(3) of the 2004 US Model BIT operates as a

fork-in-the-road even if it lists arbitral fora.”

46. Respondent contends that Claimant interprets “or” as denoting temporal exclusivity, evincing

that it in fact accepts the disjunctive definition of the word.

47. Respondent points out that the mutual exclusivity of the options of ICSID and the ICSID
Additional Facility that is specified in Article VI(3)(a)(ii) of the BIT is a matter of fact and
independent of the Parties’ choice on this matter, and cannot therefore support Claimant’s
argument that any limitations to the operation of Article VI(3)(a)(ii) would have been

indicated in that provision.**

48. Respondent characterises the phrase “under one of the following alternatives” as superfluous

to Article vi(2),° whose fork-in-the-road effect, it says, is sufficiently established by “or?
Respondent contends that the absence of this phrase from Article VI(2) of the 1992 US
Model BIT, from which Article VI(2) of the US-Ecuador BIT was copied verbatim, did not
prevent the former from operating as a fork-in-the-road."” As acknowledged by both the
Lanco tribunal and Claimant, this is the case as well for Article VII(2) of the Argentina-US

BIT, which was also copied from Article VI(2) of the 1992 US Model BIT.*®

incorporation of this provision in seven BITs whose respective Letters of Submittal from the U.S. Department of
State to the Committee of Foreign Relations of the U.S. Senate all describe this provision as allowing the investor
to make “an exclusive and irrevocable choice” of the options so listed. Respondent’s Reply, paras. 37-39. See also

49. Turning then to Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT, Respondent argues that “the absence
of [“under one of the following alternatives”] in Article VI(3)(a) is as irrelevant as its

presence is in Article VI(2).”°°

It states that the similarity of the language structures of
Article VI(2) and Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT—i.e. “may choose (1) or (2) or
(3)”—extends the indisputable fork-in-the-road effect of the former provision to the latter.”
It highlights the word “choose” in Article VI(3)(a) as denoting disjunction, as is the case for
the same word in the preceding Article VI(2).°' Respondent further points out that this
language structure derives from Articles VI(2) and Article VI(3)(a) of the 1992 US Model
BIT.”

50. Based on the interrelation between Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT,
Respondent argues that, because the “or” in Article VI(2) operates disjunctively irrespective
of whether there is a decision on the merits, the “or” in Article VI(3)(a) must be interpreted as
operating in exactly the same way.” Respondent also highlights the absence of language in
Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT that refers to or otherwise conditions the provision’s
effectiveness on a decision on the merits. Respondent stresses that “[a] fork is a fork. It’s

irrevocable, regardless of what happens once it’s exercised.”°*

51. Contrary to Claimant, Respondent contends that the doctrine of intertemporal law is “clearly

inapplicable here.” It submits that the principle of contemporaneity may apply.”

52. Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument that forks-in-the-road ordinarily delineate between
only domestic remedies and international arbitration, stating that: (1) Claimant’s argument is
not supported by the treaty language as clarified by the accompanying US Letter of
Submittal: (2) Claimant does not explain why a clause that lists choices between arbitral

fora rather than between courts and arbitral fora cannot operate as a fork-in-the-road:” and

(3) the clauses cited by Claimant in support of its argument are significantly different from
Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT.” Respondent contends that “the true purpose of
fork-in-the-road clauses is not to distinguish between domestic and international remedies,
but [is] rather the avoidance of the multiplicity of proceedings with respect to the same

investment dispute.”

As “the fork in the road is designed to prevent the investor having

several bites at the cherry,” Claimant’s interpretation would “subvert the long-standing US

policy of avoiding multiple proceedings underlying the election of [the] remedies
provisions.””*

53. Respondent argues that the addition of the phrase “under one of the following alternatives” to
Article VI(2) of the 1994 US Model BIT was intended to clarify the already unambiguous
exclusivity and irrevocability of the choice of dispute-resolution fora among those listed
therein.” It points out that the said provision operates as a fork-in-the-road even without this
phrase,”> as do corresponding provisions in seven other US BITs that had incorporated Article
VI(2) of the 1992 US Model BIT verbatim.”® Respondent stresses that “identical language
cannot be used to describe two different things, which would have to be the case were Article
VI(3)(a) [of the US-Ecuador BIT] to be read as not operating as a fork-in-the-road in the face
of the [other US BIT provisions] that do operate as a fork-in-the-road.””” It also contends that
not only was the addition of the phrase “under one of the following alternatives” unnecessary
to Article VI(2) but its absence from Article VI(3) of the US-Ecuador BIT should not create

any negative implication.”

54. As to Claimant’s argument that Respondent’s interpretation violates the effet utile principle,
Respondent notes that the “effet utile rule of interpretation does not dictate that every single
word or phrase employed in a treaty must have a meaning that is unique and different from

the meaning of every other word or phrase used in the same treaty.” It also notes that treaty

language can serve a “confirmatory or clarificatory” purpose,*” as is the case for the said
phrase. Respondent argues that the effet utile principle would in fact work against Claimant,
whose interpretation would diminish the effect given to the word “or” in the relevant

provisions of the 1992 US Model BIT.*'

B. Claimant’s Position

55. Claimant argues that Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT enumerates available and

equivalent arbitral fora but does not operate as a fork-in-the-road.*

56. Claimant contends that the analysis for ascertaining the ordinary meaning of Article VI(3)(a)
of the US-Ecuador BIT should not extend to the other treaties discussed by Respondent and
should be constrained to that BIT alone.* For example, Claimant highlights that the 1992 US
Model BIT—upon which the US-Ecuador BIT was based— is only a model treaty and not an

actual one, and, further, reflects the intention of the United States alone.“*

57. Claimant attributes the fork-in-the-road effect of Article VI(2) of the US-Ecuador BIT to the

phrase “under one of the following alternatives.”**

It points out that this phrase was not
present in the 1992 US Model BIT and was specifically inserted in Article VI(2) but not
Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT.*° This phrase not only signifies the mutual
exclusivity of the choices listed in the provision but also requires the selection of a single
option among them.” That Article VI(3)(a) contains neither this phrase nor language
analogous to it® proves that the Parties did not intend Article VI(3)(a) to operate as a fork-in-

the-road.®”

58. Claimant alleges that Respondent should be prevented from “insert[ing] this language ‘under
one of the following alternatives’ into Article VI(3) where it’s not there.””’ It summarises its

argument on this point as follows:

[t]he absence of the phrase, ‘one of the following alternatives,’ gives Article VI(3) an inclusive
character, which means the choice is not exclusive and irrevocable but can result in a second
choice in some circumstances like we have here; namely, a jurisdictional decision without a
decision on the merits and where the State has withdrawn in the interim from the original
forum.”
59. Further to this argument, Claimant highlights that the only textual limitation in Article
VI(3)(a)—which is that the investor can choose the Additional Facility of ICSID only if

ICSID itself is not available, as per Article VI(3)(a)(ii)—is specifically included therein.”

60. Claimant argues that the phrase “under one of the following alternatives” has a meaning of its
own and does not merely enhance the effect of “or” in Article VI(2). It points out that
Professor Vandevelde, Respondent’s legal expert who takes a contrary position, did not
negotiate the US-Ecuador BIT.*? Claimant also submits that the opinion of Professor
Vandevelde disregards both his contemporaries’ work and supporting documentation,” and is
discredited by his characterisation of the only phrase differentiating Articles VI(2) and
VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT as “superfluous.”°> Claimant stresses that “treaties cannot be
interpreted and should not be interpreted if there is a way to do so, to render the provisions
superfluous. They have to be given some meaning.””* This is especially the case because of

the specific insertion of this phrase in the 1994 US Model BIT.*”

61. Claimant contends that the four choices listed in Article VI(3)(a) would have been
incorporated in the three choices found in Article VI(2) if the former was intended to operate

as a fork-in-the-road.”*

62. Claimant argues that the Letter of Submittal of the US-Ecuador BIT treats the general choice

of arbitration as “exclusive and irrevocable,” but does not expound on Article VI(3)(a).”

63. According to Claimant, the 2004 US Model BIT does not shed light on the US-Ecuador BIT.
First, the US-Ecuador BIT must be interpreted as of the time it was executed, which was
more than a decade prior to 2004.'°° Second, the placement of “or” after each arbitral forum
in Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT establishes the equivalence of the enumerated fora,
which is not the case for the single “or” located after the penultimate forum in the
corresponding Article 24(3) of the 2004 US Model BIT.'° And third, Article 24(3) operates
as a fork-in-the-road because the 2004 US Model BIT imposes arbitration as the sole means.

to resolve investment disputes, which the US-Ecuador BIT does not!”

64. Claimant contends that the “or” in Article VI(3)(a), unlike the phrase “under one of the
following alternatives” or similar language," cannot establish the mutual exclusivity of the

listed arbitral fora because:

the word “or” separating the choices of arbitral fora in Article VI(3) should be interpreted as
prohibiting a foreign investor from instituting multiple arbitrations in different fora
concurrently, but not as making an investor's choice irrevocable in the event its submission to
any one such arbitral forum is rejected on jurisdictional grounds. Thus, as long as (i) an
investor’s submission to a particular arbitral forum is exclusive in time and (ii) the merits of the
investment dispute have not been decided by any forum, an investor is permitted to re-file its
claims before any of the arbitral tribunals listed in Article VI(3)—particularly when, as here, the
original forum is no longer available due to the exclusive conduct of one of the Parties in
withdrawing from that forum before the jurisdictional defect could be cured.!*

65. At the hearing, Claimant agreed that “‘or’ could be read consistent with the effet utile to mean

that the choice is exclusive insofar as it results in a decision on the merits.”"”

66. Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that the fork-in-the-road effect of Article VI(2) of
the US-Ecuador BIT operates without regard to whether a claimant can achieve a decision on
the merits, explaining that the fact that “you have ... access to the domestic court system.
suggests that you will get a decision on the merits.”!°° Claimant also stresses that the purpose

of the fork is to lead to a decision on the merits.'”

67. Claimant argues that Article VI(3)(a) uses “or” in its inclusive sense, in order to signify an

. . 108,
enumeration or equivalence.

This would not cause Article VI(3) to establish “multiple
agreements in writing” in violation of Article II of the New York Convention.'® Article II of
the New York Convention ascertains the existence of the arbitration agreement.'"° Claimant
maintains that because Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT are not agreements
to arbitrate but rather offers from the host States to do so,''! only one arbitration agreement is
created each time an investor consents to arbitration under Article VI(3)(a).!?

68. Relying on the doctrine of inter-temporal law, under which treaty interpretation must use the
meaning of words at the time the treaties were drafted," Claimant concludes that “the
dominant position at the time of the negotiation and signing of the BIT was that ‘or’ was to
be interpreted in its inclusive sense, unless special care had been taken by the drafter to make

it exclusive.”!"*

69. The inclusion of the phrase “under one of the following alternatives” in Article VI(2) of the

BIT illustrates this “special care.”''> This phrase was necessary to negate the preference for

ss116 117

the inclusive definition of “or’ and to create the fork-in-the-road effect in Article VI(2).
Claimant reiterates that the word “‘[o]r’” alone is at best ambiguous, and at the time that the
Treaty was drafted, the more common meaning was that it was inclusive.”''* Claimant states
that while both Articles VI(2) and VI(3) provide methods of dispute settlement and arbitral
fora, respectively, only Article VI(2) lists “irrevocable choices.”'"” As for the phrase “under
one of the following alternatives,” Claimant states that “just as an investor ... is not
necessarily precluded from making a second choice under the limited circumstances ... so too
the reference to ‘one of the several arbitral alternatives’ does not mean that the investor may
not ... choose another ‘one’ in the same limited circumstances.”'””

70. Claimant submits that fork-in-the-road provisions are included in BITs in order to “prevent an
investor from submitting the same claim to both domestic courts of the host State and
international arbitration.”'*!_ Such provisions do not force investors to make an irrevocable
selection between two international arbitral fora.'"? While States are of course free to draft
fork-in-the-road provisions between different arbitral fora, this should be established with

Context of Article VI(3)
A. Respondent’s Position

71. Respondent states that Article VI(3)(b) authorises an investor to initiate arbitration in
accordance with its single choice of arbitration procedure.'**

72. Respondent highlights the phrase “the choice” in Article VI(4), which it states “connotes
singularity and finality,”'” and contends that “[bJoth Article VI(3)(b) and (4) [of the US-
Ecuador BIT] contemplate one choice, the creation of one consensual bond between the
claimant investor and the host State.”!”°

73. Respondent argues that the US Letter of Submittal of the US-Ecuador BIT—which states that

settlement [and states that the] investor may make an exclusive and irrevocable choice to: (1)

B. Claimant’s Position

74. Claimant reiterates that the term “context” is limited to the Treaty itself and the provisions
surrounding Article VI.'*! It then argues that both the Message of Submittal and the Letter of
Submittal of the US-Ecuador BIT “are unilateral expressions of the United States’ position.
They tell us nothing about Ecuador’s position, and there is no suggestion that Ecuador
accepted them as instruments in any formal way.”'*?

75. In response to a question at the hearing, Claimant clarified that there is no contradiction in
relying on the Message of Submittal and the Letter of Submittal accompanying the US-
Ecuador BIT for the “object and purpose” of Article VI(3)(a). But Claimant submits that
these documents do not meet the Vienna Convention definition of “context”.'**

76. Claimant contends that the Letter of Submittal of the US-Ecuador BIT'™ establishes the
exclusivity and irrevocability of the choices presented in Article VI(2) but does not do so for
Article VI(3)(a)."* Not only does the Letter of Submittal classify the options presented in
Article VI(2) as “exclusive and irrevocable”!*® but it also clarifies that Article VI(2) “adds to
the prototype BIT language a phrase reiterating that the investor may choose among three

alternatives.”!*” As to Article VI(3)(a), however, the Letter of Submittal is silent.

77. Claimant clarifies that Article VI(4), which reiterates the State Parties’ consent to arbitration,
mentions Article VI(3)(a) but does not expound on it or otherwise limit the investor’s choice

of an arbitral forum.’

Object and purpose of the BIT
A. Respondent’s Position

78. According to Respondent, the BIT does not guarantee access to international arbitration’”
and has objectives beyond the protection of investment.'*° Specifically, Article VI of the US-
Ecuador BIT has for its purpose the avoidance of multiple proceedings.'*! Respondent notes
that its interpretation of Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT serves the purpose of allowing Claimant
recourse to international arbitration because it provides Claimant access to effective

arbitration for as long as it meets certain conditions.'*

79. Respondent stresses the importance of abiding by the actual agreement of the Parties,'*
especially because the fact that Respondent had allowed itself to be compelled to
international arbitration is a significant concession of its sovereignty.“ Respondent notes
that the consent of a State to arbitration cannot be presumed,'*° which it contends Claimant

has done.“

80. Respondent argues that “dispute-settlement clauses must be interpreted neither restrictively
nor expansively.”"*7 It contends that the effet utile principle does not require that “maximum

148

effect” be given to a text’ and therefore does not mandate the assignment of an expansive

interpretation to such a clause.'“? Further, Respondent argues that “the principle of effet utile

is not useful for the Tribunal in making a choice between [the Parties’] interpretations”

because both of these interpretations do afford Murphy a choice of arbitral forum.'*?

81. Respondent contends that Claimant has interpreted Article VI of the US-Ecuador BIT to give
itself “another bite at the cherry contrary to the terms of the provision;” this, it says, is

manifestly absurd and unreasonable.'*! It maintains that Claimant exercised its right to

152

submit the Parties’ dispute to international arbitration in the ICSID Arbitration, ~~ but its non-

compliance with the negotiation requirement led to the dismissal of its claims.'**

82. Respondent submits that the present unavailability of ICSID arbitration stems not from its
denunciation of the ICSID Convention but from Claimant’s consent to ICSID when

Respondent's denunciation was obviously forthcoming.'**

83. Respondent states that the dismissal of Claimant’s claim for lack of jurisdiction will not
prevent it from being heard on the merits. Other applicable bodies of law or remedial venues,

such as diplomatic protection, do remain available to Claimant.'*°

84. Claimant states that one of the objects of the US-Ecuador BIT is to protect investments and

grant investors access to arbitration.'*°

provide “fair and equitable treatment of [Murphy’s] investment” and to “maintain a stable

framework for investment.”'*’ Similarly, the Letter of Submittal of the US-Ecuador BIT

states that the latter authorises investors to bypass domestic courts and resort to binding

international arbitration.'**

85. Claimant notes that Article 32(b) of the Vienna Convention prohibits a treaty interpretation
159

that would lead to a “manifestly absurd or unreasonable” result.
86. Claimant contends that Respondent’s interpretation of Article VI(3)(a) violates Article 32(b)
of the Vienna Convention’ because, under the unique circumstances of this case, it would

prevent any tribunal from reaching the merits of Claimant's claim!

While Respondent has
identified an ICSID arbitration as Claimant’s only option, Respondent’s denunciation of the
ICSID Convention has made it impossible for Claimant to resubmit its claim to this forum.'®

Respondent's interpretation therefore extinguishes Claimant's right to arbitration.'

87. Claimant’s position, in other words, is that “to interpret a treaty so as to permit a new choice
to consent is particularly warranted in a situation where the legal posture of the Respondent
has changed significantly due to its withdrawal from the ICSID Convention.”" Claimant
stresses that “it would be manifestly absurd and unreasonable to deny Murphy an alternative

[to international arbitration] in light of Ecuador’s withdrawal from ICSID.”'%

88. Claimant argues that Respondent’s interpretation also violates the principle of effet utile

because it renders Article VI meaningless’ and does not facilitate the access of investors to

7

the listed dispute resolution procedures. Claimant contends that the “absolute right to

binding arbitration of investment disputes, which implies the dispute ought to be settled,

resolved in some way” is made relevant because of the effet utile principle.'*

Apart from
requiring the Tribunal to give effect to the phrase “under one of the following alternatives”
that is present in Article VI(2) but not Article VI(3)(a), the effet utile principle also “requires
the Tribunal, under the circumstances of this case where Ecuador has withdrawn from ICSID,
to interpret the dispute-resolution clause to give Murphy an opportunity to have its dispute
adjudicated on the merits rather than to foreclose this opportunity.”"®
89. Given that the right to submit disputes to international arbitration is such a central feature of
the BIT, Claimant argues that “to interpret access to international arbitration in the narrow
manner that Ecuador advocates by which no arbitral decision on the investment dispute
would ever be reached would chill foreign investment rather than promote it, and would be

inconsistent with the BIT’s object and purpose.”!”°

90. Claimant stresses that Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT contain
Respondent’s consent to UNCITRAL arbitration.'” Respondent’s position in the ICSID
Arbitration was “that there was no consent on [its] part [...] to ICSID arbitration for Murphy
International's claims.”!”” This clearly establishes that Claimant's initiation of the ICSID
Arbitration did not trigger Respondent’s consent to international arbitration, which means

that such consent occurred for the first time in the present proceedings.'”

91. Claimant differentiates the case at hand from that in Daimler v. Argentina, which involved a

dispute resolution clause that positioned ICSID arbitration and UNCITRAL arbitration, as

mutually exclusive and irrevocable alternatives through the use of “either...or.”!”*

Notwithstanding this restrictive language, however, the Daimler v. Argentina tribunal still

referred to the possibility of having a “future arbitration proceeding.”'”*

Resubmission jurisprudence
A. Claimant’s Position

93. Claimant contends that the “resubmission jurisprudence conclusively establishes that a
claimant whose original claim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction is not precluded from

commencing a new claim once the original jurisdictional flaw has been corrected.”"”*

94. Claimant refers to Waste Management v. Mexico,'”? where the tribunal accepted a claim that
was re-filed by the claimant after its failure to meet a jurisdictional requirement led to the

dismissal of its initial claim.'*° It quotes the relevant part of the holding, as follows:

In international litigation the withdrawal of a claim does not, unless otherwise agreed, amount to
a waiver of any underlying rights of the withdrawing party. Neither does a claim which fails for
want of jurisdiction prejudice underlying rights: if the jurisdictional flaw can be corrected there
is in principle no objection to the claimant State recommencing its action.'*!

95. Claimant contends that this holding is instructive for this case, given the silence or

permissiveness of Article VI(3) of the US-Ecuador BIT on the issue of resubmission.'*?

96. Claimant refers to Daimler v. Argentina, where the tribunal dismissed the claim filed by
Daimler based on its failure to meet a jurisdictional requirement, but then clarified that the
claimant could “upon satisfaction of the Treaty’s conditions precedent to arbitration

. assert any retrospective MFN claims it may have in any future arbitration proceeding
9183

97. Claimant refers to the decision in Tradex Hellas v. Albania, where the tribunal found that
Albania had consented to ICSID jurisdiction partly because “to deny ICSID jurisdiction
would force the investor to initiate arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules ... and Albania
had not indicated whether it would contest jurisdiction of arbitration under the UNCITRAL

rules.”!*

While Tradex did not involve a BIT claim, Claimant asserts its relevance to the
case at hand'** and argues that the Tribunal should allow Claimant to resort to UNCITRAL

arbitration given the current unavailability of ICSID arbitration.'*°

98. Claimant refers to L.E.S..—DIPENTA vy. Algeria, where the tribunal dismissed the claim
brought by the de facto consortium of claimants—on the ground that this consortium was not

jurisdictional requirement.'*”

99. Claimant also refers to the Dede Award in which the tribunal found that it did not have
jurisdiction because the claimants had failed to litigate their claims for a prescribed period in
local courts before instituting arbitration.'** The tribunal held that its decision was “without

BIT] have been satisfied.”"”

100. As for cooling-off periods generally, which was at issue in the ICSID Arbitration, Claimant
cites Ethyl Corporation v. the Government of Canada, Ronald S. Lauder v. Czech Republic,
Wena Hotels, and SGS v. Pakistan to illustrate that the non-observation of cooling-off periods
does not lead to the dismissal of claims, as these periods are procedural in nature.'*
Moreover, forcing claimants to re-file their claims when these periods have expired in the
meantime would be uneconomical.'”!

101. Claimant states that Article 26 of the ICSID Convention does not prohibit a claimant whose
initial claim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction from bringing a new claim.’ As this
provision “aims at preventing a party to resort to more than one forum simultaneously, or to

39193

disrupt an existing choice of forum,”””” Article 26 prohibits the re-filing of a claim only when

there has been a decision on the merits, which is not the case here .'°*

B. Respondent’s Position

102. Respondent contends that the cases Claimant cites do not “establish that a claimant whose

original claim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under one chosen forum may commence

a new arbitration before a different arbitral forum absent the consent of the respondent.”!**

At most, Respondent argues, they “stand for the proposition that an investor who has
consented to an arbitral procedure might be able to resubmit its claims for arbitration, in the
case of a curable jurisdictional defect, to the same arbitral forum, provided, of course, that the

conditions for accessing that procedure are met.”!°°

103. Respondent states that Waste Management II was based on language specific to the North

106. Respondent argues that even if the tribunal’s statement in Dede v. Romania that its “decision
is without prejudice to Claimant’s right to file its claims once the jurisdictional preconditions
[...] have been satisfied” could be considered a determination—which Respondent claims it
is not—this does not support Claimant’s position that it may chose a different forum from the

one it originally chose."

107. Respondent distinguishes this case from both E.7.J. Euro Telecom International N.V. v.
Bolivia, where the parties agreed for the ICSID claim to be withdrawn and resubmitted to
UNCITRAL arbitration,° and Nova Scotia Power Incorporated v. Venezuela, where the
respondent stipulated that the case could be submitted to UNCITRAL arbitration.”"”

108. Respondent contends that Ethyl v. Canada, Lauder v. Czech Republic, Wena Hotels v. Egypt,

and SGS v. Pakistan authorised resubmission to the same forum, but did not consider whether

the investor could consent to a forum other than that originally chosen.”

109. Respondent refers to Lauder v. Czech Republic, where the tribunal characterised the purpose
of Article VI(3) of the US-Czech Republic Treaty—which i:

US-Ecuador Treaty””’—as preventing a claimant from bringing an investment dispute against

 

similar to Article VI(3) of the

the same respondent “before different arbitral tribunals.”""”
110. Respondent argues that Claimant’s original selection of ICSID arbitration reinforces
Respondent’s characterisation of Article VI(3)(a). The ICSID Convention prohibits a party

21 and

from unilaterally withdrawing its consent when both parties have given their consent
provides that the consent to ICSID arbitration shall be deemed to exclude any other
remedy.”! Respondent also quotes Professor Schreuer’s Commentary, as follows: “once
consent to ICSID arbitration has been given, the parties have lost their right to seek relief in

another forum, national and international, and are restricted to pursuing their claim through

investor has expressed its consent in choosing ICSID arbitration, the only means of dispute

settlement available is ICSID arbitration.”*!*

Validity of Claimant’s Consent to Murphy I

A. Claimant’s Position

111.

Claimant makes the following alternative argument:

Murphy accepts in the alternative that per the ICSID Tribunal Award of the Murphy First
Award and Ecuador{‘s] position throughout the first and second ICSID proceedings, Murphy’s
consent to ICSID arbitration was ineffective; and therefore, Murphy has stated and restates that
[it] first gave effective consent to international arbitration in its 2011 UNCITRAL Request for
Arbitration”?

112. Claimant argues that the finding of the Murphy I tribunal confirms the invalidity of Murphy’s
consent to ICSID arbitration under the BIT.*'° Claimant's legal expert, Professor Ratner, thus
submits that “[t]he denial of jurisdiction by one arbitral venue allows the investor to make a
claim in another arbitral venue to whose jurisdiction the State has already consented.””!”
While it did resubmit its claim to ICSID arbitration (only to withdraw the said claim at a later
time), Claimant clarifies that it did not consent anew to ICSID arbitration, but merely used
the same consent that the Murphy I tribunal had found to be invalid.’'* Claimant argues that
its first valid consent to international arbitration under Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador
BIT was to this UNCITRAL arbitration.””

113. Claimant further argues that the invalidation of its consent to ICSID arbitration is rooted in
the text of Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT itself,” in that the six-month negotiation period
stipulated in that provision is “not just a precondition to Ecuador’s consent ... [but] is a
precondition to Murphy’s ability even to choose the perfect [consent] to any of the arbitral

forums including ICSID.”**"

114. Turning first to Article VI(2) of the BIT, Claimant identifies three conditions that an investor
must meet before submitting a dispute for resolution: (1) that “an investment dispute” had

22

arisen;~~ (2) that the Parties had sought “resolution [of their investment dispute] through
consultation and negotiation;"”** and (3) that the Parties had failed to settle their dispute.***
According to Claimant, Article VI(4) of the US-Ecuador BIT provides that the consent of the
State to arbitrate is subject to the compliance of the investor with the conditions set in Article
VI(3).°> And finally, Article VI(3) provides that the validity of Claimant’s consent is subject
to the condition “that Murphy had initiated the six months’ negotiation, and those six months

[had] elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose.”?°

115.

a

Claimant points to the finding of the Murphy I tribunal—whose Award is res judicata
between the Parties””’—that the dispute between the Parties had arisen on 29 February 2008,

which is when Claimant communicated a treaty breach to Respondent.”

According to
Article VI(3) of the BIT, Claimant could only consent to arbitration six months after this date
or on | September 2008.” Claimant notes that “it is not disputed between the Parties that

Murphy only chose to consent in writing to ICSID before September 1*', 2008.”?*°

B. Respondent’s Position

116. Respondent stresses that the Murphy I Award held only that Claimant’s failure to comply
with the negotiation requirement of Article VI(3) of the BIT resulted in the tribunal not

having jurisdiction to decide Claimant’s claim.?**

117. While the failure to comply with a negotiation requirement leads (as in this case) to the

dismissal of a BIT claim,”

Respondent clarifies that “Murphy’s failure to satisfy its
obligation to negotiate, at least during six months, does not have as a consequence [that]
Murphy’s choice of ICSID arbitration was null[,] and void or non-existent.”*** Respondent
stresses that the consent of the investor to an arbitral forum is separate from the fulfillment of
conditions precedent to the State’s consent to arbitration.’ It argues that “the investor can
make its election of forum before the condition precedent is satisfied. The limitation is that
this election does not perfect the State’s consent.”?*
118. In this case, while Claimant’s non-compliance with this requirement prevented it from
triggering the consent of Respondent to ICSID arbitration,”*° Claimant consented to ICSID

That Claimant

arbitration and thereby made an irrevocable choice of arbitral forum.*
recognised the validity and irrevocability of its consent to ICSID arbitration can be discerned
from its withdrawal, without prejudice, of its second ICSID claim” and by its efforts to seek

the agreement of Ecuador on a different arbitral forum.””

Award. Respondent submits that (i) as the Turkey-Romania BIT at issue in Dede v Romania does not include any
fork-in-the-road provision, the exclusive and irrevocable nature of a choice of arbitral forum was not at issue; (ii)
the Dede Award was not about conditions to a claimant’s consent to arbitrate but rather about conditions to a
respondent State’s consent to arbitrate and a claimant investor’s right to submit a dispute to arbitration; and (iii)
the Dede Award is not authority for the proposition that an investor's choice to consent to one or the other forum
under Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT would be rendered invalid for failure to fulfill a condition precedent to the
submission of a claim to arbitration.

119. Respondent further argues that the international law principle of ex injuria non oritur jus—
under which a party cannot create a legal entitlement for itself using its own wrongful
conduct™”—prevents Claimant from using its own non-compliance to the negotiation
requirement in Article VI(3) to benefit itself at the expense of Respondent, which is the party
protected by this condition precedent.™!

120. Respondent’s position is that Claimant would have been unable, even in the absence of an
ICSID denunciation, to commence a second ICSID arbitration on the basis of its original

consent to Murphy I, as its original consent was effective”?

44 Claimant’s Response, para. 79. Claimant stresses that ample time had passed between its filing of the request
for ICSID Arbitration and the time that Ecuador passed Law 42 and received notice from Repsol, the
Consortium’s operator, for a violation of the Spain-Ecuador BIT based on the same facts. It also points out that it
had engaged in negotiations with Respondent before and after the passage of Law 42. Claimant's Response, para.

45 Claimant’s Response, para. 79. Claimant states that when it filed its request for ICSID Arbitration, it did so on
the basis of unanimous ICSID decisions holding that waiting periods were not jurisdictional requirements but
procedural matters. Claimant's Response, para. 79, citing Murphy’s Request for Arbitration, para. 50.

that its jurisdictional objection was unlikely to succeed.” It further points out that non-
compliance with waiting periods have been excused based on the futility of negotiations, “*

which Respondent’s ultimatum to investors to either comply with Law 42 or abandon their

investments guaranteed in this case.””?

122. Claimant states that it resubmitted its claim to ICSID when Respondent failed to indicate its

250

preferred arbitral forum.” It points out that international law imposes consequences on a

State’s failure to object when faced with an unequivocal proposal to resolve a dispute.”*!
Claimant moreover alleges that the combination of Respondent’s silence on this matter and
its denunciation of the ICSID Convention “have a direct relevance for understanding the good

faith of Ecuador’s conduct and the consequence of such conduct.”

Claimant contends that, while Respondent objected to the resubmission of Claimant’s ICSID.
claim, Respondent also posited that Claimant would be allowed to pursue its claims in
another forum. Claimant explains that it was on the basis of these representations—as well as
on its own desire to “avoid a long and costly jurisdictional procedure”—that it decided to
withdraw its resubmitted claim and commence UNCITRAL arbitration instead.* In doing
so, Claimant contends that it accepted Respondent’s position that Claimant did not validly

consent to ICSID Arbitration.”

B. Respondent’s Position

124. Respondent considers it “irrelevant that Claimant’s choice has not played out well for it and

that it has been unable to secure a decision on the merits of its claims under its chosen arbitral

mechanism due, as it happens, to its own reckless procedural attitude.”**°

125. Respondent rejects Claimant’s contention that it filed its ICSID Arbitration claim in good
faith. It points out that the Murphy I tribunal correctly relied on the characterisation of the
Enron v. Argentina tribunal of the negotiation period as jurisdictional, and dismisses

256

Claimant’s contention that the relevant passage in that case was dicta. It notes that the

United States considers conditions attached to arbitration to be mandatory and

jurisdictional.”*”’

126. Respondent rejects the contention of Claimant that it had negotiated with Respondent prior to
bringing its claim in the ICSID Arbitration, and points out that it was precisely the failure of
Claimant to negotiate with Respondent prior to bringing its claim in the ICSID Arbitration

that the Murphy I tribunal considered a breach of Article VI of the BIT.**

127. Clarifying that it represented to the Murphy I tribunal that it would negotiate with Claimant in

good faith but not that such negotiations would be successful Respondent contends that it

did negotiate with Claimant in good faith.” But, it says, Claimant treated the negotiation as a

Claimant that it would not settle for less than the amount claimed in Murphy we

Stressing that it was under no obligation to confirm its agreement to a non-ICSID alternative
if the negotiations between it and Claimant failed, Respondent notes that “it was silence
from Ecuador [that met] this wish of Murphy to go or to obtain freedom to go to
UNCITRAL. And Murphy could not be misled by Ecuador’s silence.” It further portrays
Claimant’s efforts to secure the agreement of Respondent to UNCITRAL arbitration as proof

that Claimant itself considered its consent to ICSID arbitration to be valid and irrevocable.”

129. Respondent argues that its renunciation of the ICSID Convention was a “lawful exercise of a

right afforded to Ecuador by international law”?°*

and not an attempt to deprive Claimant of
its chosen forum.” It states that Claimant could have availed of arbitration under the ICSID

rules had it complied with the jurisdictional requirement in filing its claim.

130. Respondent contends that Claimant chose to withdraw its refiled ICSID claim for its own
reasons and not because it relied on alleged representations by Respondent.” If it had truly
relied on Respondent’s alleged representations, then Claimant would not have withdrawn its

claim “without prejudice.”””

131. Respondent argues that the principle of good faith and the doctrines of estoppel and
preclusion cannot oblige Respondent to submit to UNCITRAL arbitration without its
consent.””!

In other words, the doctrine of estoppel holds Respondent to its previous position, under
which consent to UNCITRAL arbitration is Claimant's first valid consent under the BIT.”
To hold otherwise would allow Respondent to secure an unfair advantage over Claimant, who

would then be denied the opportunity to have its claim heard on the merits.””*

Claimant also argues that estoppel prevents Respondent from withdrawing its previous
position that Claimant could resubmit its dispute to an arbitral forum other than ICSID.”*
According to Claimant, while Respondent objected to the resubmission of Claimant’s ICSID
claim, it also argued that Claimant would be allowed to pursue its claims in another forum.
Claimant specifically points to Respondent’s 28 July 2011 letter to ICSID, which states: “If
no operative consent exists, Article 26 [of the ICSID Convention] does not operate and the
foreign national is free to pursue other remedies. This is exactly the situation of a claimant
whose claim has been dismissed by an ICSID award for lack of jurisdiction.”””° The letter
further states that “in case the ICSID tribunal has given an award in which it finds that the
dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, a party may take that dispute to another
forum for a decision on the merits.”””

Claimant contends that this case meets the “more traditional notion of estoppel involving
detrimental reliance.”””* It identifies its “detrimental reliance” as the withdrawal of its refiled
ICSID claim and the re-filing of its claim under the UNCITRAL Rules. *”” Such reliance has
been prejudicial, in that Claimant has had to incur legal costs to defend against Respondent's
jurisdictional objections.**” Were this Tribunal to uphold Respondent’s objections, Claimant

notes that its reliance would be more prejudicial stills!

135. Claimant contends that the principle of estoppel applies even if the representation involved
concerns “the conduct of the parties in construing their respective rights and duties,” and is
therefore not of fact but of law.”** It stresses that legal representations, and not just factual

ones, can give Respondent an unfair advantage."

B. Respondent’s Position

136. Respondent clarifies that it has always argued that the failure of Claimant to comply with the
six-month negotiation period in the BIT was ineffective in the sense that it could not perfect

the consent of Respondent to ICSID arbitration.**

137.

a

Respondent stresses that it did not induce Claimant to withdraw its refiled ICSID claim and
submit its dispute to UNCITRAL arbitration.*** Referring specifically to its 28 July 2011
letter, Respondent states that “it was arguing [there] that Murphy could not rely on its original
consent in order to resubmit claims to ICSID in light of the denunciation because Murphy’s

instrument of consent simply could not sustain more than one proceeding under the ICSID

19286

Convention. And even if there was a representation, Respondent classifies this

representation as being one of law, which cannot support a claim for estoppel.”*”

138. Respondent highlights the absence of detrimental reliance on the part of Claimant,”** which it
characterises as “indispensable for the existence of a situation of estoppel.””*’ It reiterates
that Claimant withdrew its second ICSID claim “without prejudice” in its own self-interest

and to avoid a lengthy jurisdictional challenge.”

139. Even if Claimant did rely on Respondent’s position during Murphy I, Respondent contends

that Claimant suffered no prejudice as a result” Had Claimant not withdrawn its second

request for ICSID arbitration and instead proceeded with that case, it still would have faced

Claimant argues that Respondent first violated the doctrine of preclusion when it represented
that it would in good faith negotiate with Claimant in order to fulfill the six-month
negotiation period of Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT” but then allegedly attempted to
disassociate the negotiations from the BIT requirement, withdrew from the ICSID

Convention, and then objected to Claimant’s resubmission of its ICSID claim.”

Claimant points out that Respondent has benefitted from its change in position, in that:
“Ecuador is better off facing the possible enforcement of a New York Convention award

rendered by an UNCITRAL Tribunal, rather than that of an ICSID award, which cannot be

challenged in domestic courts and for which no exequatur is required for enforcement.”””

B. Respondent’s Position

144, Respondent rejects Claimant’s definition of preclusion, which it states contains two criteria: a

“clear and unequivocal representation” and “detrimental reliance.’ It is Respondent’s

position that there is no substantive difference between preclusion and estoppel.”"

Respondent accuses Claimant of hedging its risk in view of its withdrawal of its second

request for ICSID arbitration “without prejudice.
Respondent dismisses the inference allegedly drawn by Claimant (that it can pursue its claim,

Convention (that the issuance of an ICSID jurisdictional award leads to the expiration of the

318

Respondent did succeed in this defense because the Murphy I tribunal held that the six-month

Respondent further contends that Respondent abandoned its position on the validity of the

»

Claimant stresses that the ruling of the Murphy I tribunal was not supported by either the
326

jurisprudence constante of that time or investment arbitration scholars.
154. Claimant explains that it chose not to seek an annulment of the Murphy I award and to submit
its claim to arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules instead because it accepted Respondent’s

position that ICSID was no longer available to Claimant.”’

Claimant argues that “an
investor’s compliance with the state of the law as argued successfully by its opponent may
not be held against it.”**- Because Claimant has abided by Respondent's interpretation of the

Murphy I award; Respondent cannot now hold Claimant's previous position against it.”

Claimant points out that Respondent could have but did not seek an annulment of the Murphy
Taward either. It is Respondent, therefore, that is contradicting the position it took in relation
to Murphy 1.5”

156. Claimant stresses that it chose to withdraw its second request for ICSID arbitration because
of Respondent’s representation that Claimant could submit its claim to another forum and
Claimant’s belief that incurring the costs of a jurisdictional proceeding in view of this

representation would be unnecessarily detrimental to both Parties."

Vv. TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS
Introduction

15

©

Article VI(2) of the US-Ecuador BIT provides that:

In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a
resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably,
the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the
following alternatives, for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedures;
or

(

2

in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.

160. For this provision to apply there must exist an “investment dispute” that “cannot be settled
amicably.” In such circumstances, the investor may choose to submit the dispute under one

of the three alternatives listed.

161.

It is uncontested that this provision contains a classic fork-in-the-road provision and that the

three alternatives are mutually exclusive.

162. In the present case, Murphy chose to submit the dispute in accordance with the terms of

paragraph 3, which provide as follows:

3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for
resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the
date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to
consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding
arbitration:

  

@

to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“Centre”)
established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18,
1965 (“ICSID Convention”), provided that the Party is a party to such
Convention; or

(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or

(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or

(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration
rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.

(b) once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute
may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.

163. More precisely, in March 2008, Murphy commenced the ICSID Arbitration. On 15 December
2010, a majority of the tribunal in that arbitration declined jurisdiction on the ground that
Claimant had failed to comply with the six-month negotiation period stipulated in Article
VI(3)(a). The Murphy I Award was limited to this finding; the tribunal made no
pronouncement, for instance, on the validity of Murphy’s or Ecuador’s consent to the ICSID

Arbitration.

164. On 30 December 2010, in order to cure the defect identified in the Murphy I Award,
Claimant initiated negotiations with Ecuador. In the meantime, on 6 July 2009, Ecuador had
denounced the ICSID Convention with effect as of 7 January 2010. This notwithstanding, and
given that Ecuador had declined to state whether it would agree to UNCITRAL arbitration in
light of its withdrawal from the ICSID Convention, on 13 July 2010, Claimant recommenced
arbitration against Ecuador under the ICSID Convention, relying on Ecuador’s consent of
2008. Ecuador again raised objections to jurisdiction. As a result, Claimant withdrew its
ICSID request on 19 August 2011 and on 21 September 2011, commenced arbitration in
accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules under Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the BIT.

165. In these proceedings, Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, alleging inter
alia that the word “or” between the arbitral options set out in Article VI(3)(a) is disjunctive

and thus renders the choice between those fora mutually exclusive.

The Tribunal recognises and the Parties have acknowledged that this is a case of first
impression with an unprecedented factual matrix. The unique issue before the Tribunal can be
stated as follows: can Claimant submit its claim to UNCITRAL arbitration under Article
VI(3)(a) given that, first, its prior submission of the claim to ICSID arbitration in Murphy I
was dismissed by the ICSID tribunal for lack of jurisdiction; that, second, Claimant
recommenced arbitration against Ecuador under the ICSID Convention and later withdrew its

request; and that, finally, ICSID arbitration is no longer available.

In reaching its decision, the Tribunal has carefully considered the pleadings and supporting
materials of the Parties, both written and oral. The Tribunal shall rule on only those issues

that are relevant for it to reach its decision.
Treaty Interpretation

The analysis of Respondent’s jurisdictional objection necessarily begins with the specific
language of Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with Article 31(1) of the

Vienna Convention.

Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention provides, in relevant part:

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to
be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and
purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition
to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the
conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related
to the treaty.

The Tribunal shall thus examine the “ordinary meaning” of the terms of Article VI(3)(a) “in

their context and in light of [the BIT’s] object and purpose.”

The Tribunal shall also be guided by the principle of effet utile, which requires tribunals to
interpret treaty provisions “so as to give them their fullest weight and effect consistent with

the normal sense of the words and with other parts of the text, and in such a way that a reason.

Partial Award on Jurisdiction
Page 50 of 58

and a meaning can be attributed to every part of the text."°° The Tribunal notes that the
Parties do not dispute the application of this principle but instead disagree as to how the

principle should be applied.
A. Ordinary meaning of Article VI(3)

172.

Nv

It is Respondent’s case that Article VI(3)(a) lists mutually exclusive and irrevocable choices
between arbitral fora. The Tribunal notes, however, that there is no explicit limitation to this
effect in the text of the provision and that it is plausible that the word “or” in Article VI(3)(a)
conveys inclusiveness as Claimant submits. Absent text explicitly signifying a limitation, it
is Respondent’s burden to establish that such a limitation exists and that Claimant’s

interpretation is implausible. The Tribunal considers that Respondent has not met its burden.

 

173. The Tribunal finds that Article VI(3)(a)—interpreted in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to its terms—lists arbitral fora that are available to the investor, but does:
not signify the mutual exclusivity of the arbitral fora or otherwise require the selection of a
single choice among them. Unlike Article VI(2) of the BIT, Article VI(3)(a) does not,

therefore, operate as a fork-in-the-road.

174. In this regard, the Tribunal notes, first, that in support of its position on the ordinary meaning
of the BIT, Respondent has referred to treaties that it alleges are similar to the US-Ecuador
BIT. The Tribunal considers those treaties to be informative to the present exercise only to

the extent that its interpretation of the US-Ecuador BIT needs to be supplemented.

175.

On

Second, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s argument based on Article II of the New York
Convention; namely, that an inclusive meaning of “or” would allow the investor to consent to
more than one arbitral forum, thereby leading to the creation of multiple agreements in
writing in violation of Article II of the New York Convention. As Claimant points out,
Article II of the New York Convention concerns the existence of an arbitration agreement.
When an investor selects an arbitral forum by commencing an arbitration, the standing offer
of the State is met by the acceptance of the investor which thus completes the arbitration
agreement. While there may be several options of arbitral fora making up the State’s
standing offer to arbitrate, only one arbitration agreement is created whenever an investor

selects an arbitral forum.

Third, the Tribunal finds that the structural difference between Article 24(3) of the 2004 US
Model BIT and Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT prevents the former provision from.
being helpful in the Tribunal’s interpretation of the latter. As pointed out by Claimant,
Article 24(3) imposes international arbitration as the sole mechanism for dispute resolution,

while Article VI(2)(c) of the US-Ecuador BIT presents international arbitration “in
accordance with the terms of [Article VI(3)]” as just one option for dispute resolution among

two other options, as listed in Articles VI(2)(a) and VI(2)(b), respectively.

The disagreement between the Parties on the meaning of “under one of the following
alternatives” in Article VI(2) can be characterised as an extension of their dispute over the
effect of “or” in Article VI(3)(a). Both Parties agree that Article VI(2) operates as a fork-in-
the-road. But the question is whether this operation is triggered by the word “or” (as
Respondent argues) or by the phrase “under one of the following alternatives” (as Claimant

argues).

The Tribunal considers that the presence of the phrase “under one of the following
alternatives” in Article VI(2) and its corresponding absence in Article VI(3)(a) are
meaningful. The inclusion of this language in Article VI(2) puts its operation as a fork-in-
the-road provision beyond doubt. The fact that this language is absent from Article VI(3)(a)
satisfies the Tribunal that this provision does not operate as a fork-in-the-road. The Tribunal
cannot read a limitation into a provision that does not have a limitation. Moreover, the
absence of the phrase “under one of the following alternatives” enhances the plausibility of

assigning a meaning to Article VI(3)(a) under which the “or” is inclusive only.

From a literal standpoint alone, the effet utile principle dictates a textual interpretation of the
BIT under which the word “or” in both Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) denotes inclusiveness, and
the phrase “under one of the following alternatives” in Article VI(2) is not superfluous to the

text. Rather, the phrase is necessary to establish a restrictive definition.

The Tribunal does not disagree with Respondent’s argument that treaty language can have a
confirmatory or clarificatory purpose and that even such language must be given weight and
effect. The principle of effet utile mandates not just that treaty terms be given weight and
effect, but also that they be accorded “their fullest weight and effect consistent with the

normal sense of the words and with other parts of the text, and in such a way that a reason

Partial Award on Jurisdiction
Page 52 of 58

and a meaning can be attributed to every part of the text.”**” The Tribunal therefore disagrees
with Respondent’s statement that the effet utile principle “does not require a maximum effect

be given to a text.”***

181.

That the effet utile principle mandates the selection of a better meaning among other plausible
meanings for the treaty terms must be correct. Were the Tribunal not to seek the better
meaning for the treaty terms, then all plausible definitions of such terms would stand on equal
footing and lead to an impasse due to the impossibility of either ascertaining a single meaning

for the text or reconciling several equally valid but conflicting meanings.

182. A broader application of the effet utile principle in conjunction with an analysis of the object

and purpose of the BIT leads to the same result. Claimant argued that “‘or’ could be read
consistent with the effet utile principle to mean that the choice is exclusive insofar as it results
in a decision on the merits....”*°° In answer to this, Respondent stressed that the fork-in-the-
road effect of Article VI(2) of the BIT is replicated exactly in Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT,
stating that the choice of one arbitral forum is exclusive, irrevocable, and irreversible: “You
[cannot] make another choice of forum, whether or not there is a resolution on the merits of
the claim.” Specifically, Respondent argued that the disjunctive function of the word “or”
in Article VI(2) could not be conditioned on Claimant receiving a decision on the merits and,
therefore, neither should this be the case for Article VIG3)(a)."" Respondent also highlighted
the absence of language in Article VI(3)(a) that referred to the possibility of obtaining a

decision on the merits as a condition for its effectiveness.“

183. While the Tribunal acknowledges that Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT—as well as Article
VI(2)—does not explicitly refer to a decision on the merits, it nevertheless finds that an
interpretation of both provisions in accordance with the effet utile principle mandates that
such a result be obtained. The basis for this is the object and purpose of the BIT, which will

be discussed in Section C.

B. Context of Article VI(3)
184. As previously indicated, Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention defines context as follows:

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in
addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the
conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument
related to the treaty.

185. The Tribunal is cognisant of the Parties’ dispute as to whether the Message of Submittal and
the Letter of Submittal constitute part of the context for the purpose of an analysis under
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The Tribunal finds it unnecessary to resolve this
dispute. It remains the case that both Parties have relied on these materials in support of their

respective positions.

186. The Tribunal finds nothing in the context of Article VI(3) that would discredit the results of
the previous analysis of the ordinary meaning of that treaty provision. While the contextual

indicati highlighted by Respondent may indicate disjunction between arbitral fora, these
indications are consistent with the Tribunal’s interpretation that the disjunctive meaning of
the word “or” in Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT is only triggered once there is a decision on the

merits.
Cc. Object and Purpose of the BIT

187. The Tribunal notes that its dismissal of the Respondent’s interpretation of Article VI(3)(a)
sufficiently disposes of the jurisdictional objection of the Respondent, but further observes
that the interpretation advocated by Claimant most accords to the object and purpose of the
BIT.

188. One of the objectives of the Treaty is to give the investor access to a meaningful arbitration.
This is evidenced by both Article VI(2), which prioritises the amicable settlement of disputes
but offers alternatives for dispute resolution in the event that such settlement is impossible,

and Article VI(3)(a), which gives the investor the option of submitting “the dispute for

Partial Award on Jurisdiction
Page 54 of 58

settlement by binding arbitration.” It is particularly noteworthy that Black’s Law Dictionary

defines “settlement” as “an agreement ending a dispute or lawsuit.”

189. This objective is further evidenced in the US Letter of Submittal for the US-Ecuador BIT,
which lists as one of the principal BIT objectives to ascertain that “[n]ationals and companies
of either Party, in investment disputes with the host government, have access to binding
international arbitration, without first resorting to domestic courts.”*4

190. The Tribunal notes that if it were to dismiss Claimant’s claim on the basis of Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection, the dispute would not be settled and Claimant would not have access

to a binding resolution of the merits of its case through international arbitration.

191. The Tribunal also notes Respondent’s argument that one of the objectives of a fork-in-the-
road provision is to prevent a multiplicity of proceedings with respect to the same investment
dispute. Because this case involves the replacement of an unavailable forum with an
available one, and because the one arbitral forum to which Claimant could have theoretically
resubmitted its dismissed claim is now unavailable, there can be no concern here about a
duplication of proceedings. Furthermore, and by way of a more general observation, fork-in-
the-road provisions typically distinguish between contract claims and treaty claims. They are

not designed to prevent the kind situation that arises here.

192. The Tribunal further notes Respondent’s argument that “there is no extrinsic object and
purpose of the Treaty of guaranteeing an adjudication on the merits of an investor’s claim
whether in the courts, whether in a previously agreed procedure, or in treaty arbitration.”*“°

The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. As Claimant has pointed out, access to

dispute resolution is in fact structured so as to lead to a decision on the merits.

193. Furthermore, that a claimant in an international arbitration is not always entitled to a decision
on the merits of its claims does not mean that the said claimant could not be entitled to such a

decision in some cases or, more particularly, under the unique facts of this case. And with

 

regard to this specific case, the Tribunal finds that the object and purpose of the US-Ecuador
BIT—as manifested in the references to the “settlement” of disputes and “binding

international arbitration”—operate in conjunction with the circumstances of this case to

mandate that Claimant be allowed to obtain a decision on the merits of its claim, subject to

the Tribunal’s determination of Respondent's other jurisdictional objections.

194. It is noteworthy that (1) Claimant has cured the procedural defect that led to the dismissal of
the first ICSID arbitration; (2) the resubmission jurisprudence suggests that ICSID arbitration
would still have been available to Claimant were it not for Respondent’s withdrawal from the
ICSID Convention; and (3) Claimant may have been led to believe that UNCITRAL
arbitration was acceptable to Respondent, and may have withdrawn its refiled ICSID claim

on that basis.

195. The Tribunal is convinced that the resubmission jurisprudence presented by Claimant
establishes that the failure of a party to abide by the so-called “cooling-off period” is a
curable procedural defect and not an absolute jurisdictional hurdle. In Waste Management v.
Mexico, for example, the tribunal delineated between the underlying rights of a claim and the
jurisdictional requirements that attach to the filing of a claim, which explains why the tribunal
in that case accepted a claim that was refiled by the claimant after that claim was initially
dismissed for the claimant’s failure to meet a jurisdictional requirement.” In Daimler v.
Argentina, the tribunal dismissed a claim for the claimant’s failure to meet a jurisdictional
requirement but at the same time noted that the claimant could bring its claims once it

fulfilled the so-called conditions precedent to arbitration.“

196.

a

Respondent itself characterises the relevant resubmission jurisprudence as “[at most]
stand[ing] for the proposition that an investor who has consented to an arbitral procedure
might be able to resubmit its claims for arbitration, in the case of a curable jurisdictional
defect, to the same arbitral forum, provided, of course, that the conditions for accessing that
procedure are met.” From this characterisation, the Tribunal notes that Respondent itself
seems to take issue not with the right of Claimant to resubmit its dispute per se but, rather,

with Claimant’s resubmission of its dispute to an arbitral forum other than ICSID.

197.

x

Under the circumstances of this case, Respondent’s interpretation of Article VI(3)(a) entirely
forecloses Claimant’s access to international arbitration. The Tribunal considers such a result
to run counter to the object and purpose of the BIT and to be “manifestly absurd and

unreasonable” under the meaning of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.

198. The Tribunal acknowledges that Respondent was fully within its right to withdraw from the
ICSID Convention. The Tribunal recognises, however, that Respondent’s denunciation of the
ICSID Convention forms part of the factual matrix that must be considered in its evaluation
of the results to which the Parties’ respective interpretations of Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) of
the BIT would lead.

199. At the hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties whether, under the circumstances of this case
and assuming that Respondent had not withdrawn from the ICSID Convention, Claimant
could have validly refiled its claim with ICSID, as it had since complied with the six-month
negotiation period indicated in Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT.**° As previously stated, Claimant
answered this question in the affirmative. Respondent answered that Claimant would not
have been able to commence a second ICSID arbitration based on its original consent in
Murphy I,*! but refrained from expressing a position on whether Claimant could have
consented anew to ICSID arbitration were it not for Respondent’s withdrawal from the ICSID

Convention.***

200. The Tribunal finds that this question must be answered in the affirmative. Specifically,
because Claimant has since cured the procedural defect that led to the dismissal of its claim in
Murphy I, it could have refiled its claim for resolution via ICSID arbitration had Respondent
not renounced the ICSID Convention. On both its own analysis of the resubmission
jurisprudence and Respondent’s characterisation of it, the Tribunal is satisfied that a claimant
that has since cured the procedural defect that had led to the dismissal of its initial claim can
refile its claim in the same forum. Since this same forum is unavailable in this case, in
keeping with the object and purpose of the Treaty, Claimant shall have recourse to
UNCITRAL arbitration.

Validity of Claimant’s Consent to Murphy I

201. Even were the Tribunal to accept Respondent’s position that Article VI(3)(a) operates as a
fork-in-the-road, it finds that the consent of Claimant to the present UNCITRAL arbitration

constitutes its first valid consent to international arbitration under Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT.

202. On this issue, Respondent argues that an investor can select an arbitral forum that then
triggers the fork-in-the-road effect of Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT even before the fulfilment of
the condition precedent; the effect of the non-fulfilment of the condition precedent is that the
selection would not then trigger the consent of the State to arbitration? Respondent also
submits that when a party has itself prevented a condition precedent from being fulfilled, that
party may not seek to derive benefit from its own breach of the condition; in other words, in
this case, Murphy cannot seek to have its own election of ICSID rendered invalid by invoking

its own failure to respect the negotiating period requirement.***

203. The Tribunal considers it clear from the text of Article VI(3)(a) that Claimant—or the
“company concerned” in this case—could only “choose to consent in writing to the
submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration” after meeting two conditions.
First, that Claimant had not submitted the dispute for settlement under Articles VI(2)(a) and
VI(2)(b). That Claimant satisfies this condition is not disputed. Second, that “six months
have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose.” The Murphy I tribunal dismissed
Claimant’s ICSID case precisely because Claimant had not met this requirement—which the
Murphy I tribunal had found to be jurisdictional. The Murphy I tribunal defined the date on
which the dispute arose as 29 February 2008, which is when Murphy wrote to Ecuador
alleging a breach of the Treaty. The Murphy I tribunal simply held that it had no jurisdiction
over Claimant’s claim and did not address the issue of the validity of either Claimant’s or
Respondent’s consent in respect of the ICSID Arbitration. The Tribunal finds that the
invalidity of Claimant’s choice of ICSID arbitration is a necessary consequence and corollary

of the decision of the Murphy I tribunal.

204. Article VI(3)(a) explicitly provides a condition precedent to Claimant’s valid selection of an
arbitral forum and its acceptance of the host State’s offer of consent of international
arbitration. Because Claimant did not make a valid choice of forum and therefore did not
properly accept the State’s offer of consent, the consent that it gave in the present
proceedings to UNCITRAL arbitration is the first instance of proper consent under Article

VI(3)(a).
