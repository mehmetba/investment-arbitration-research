and the Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic (Mongolia) concerning the
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments 1991 (the Treaty) and under the Foreign

fraudulent misrepresentation.

On 3 October 2011, the Respondent submitted a set of 62 requests, outlined in a Redfern Schedule,

for the production of documents from the Claimants.

On 30 November 2011, the Claimants submitted an Answer to Respondent’s Request for
Production of Documents by which they objected to each of Mongolia’s requests.

On 23 December 2011, after further exchanges, the Tribunal requested that the Parties confer on

the pending requests.

On 6 January 2012, the Tribunal convened a conference call during which the Parties updated the
Tribunal on the status of the requests for the production of documents, and the Tribunal, while
advising that it did not intend to indicate how it might finally rule, asked questions and made

observations intended to assist the Parties to reach a resolution.

On 24 April 2012, having had no further advice from the Parties, the Tribunal requested

confirmation that they had resolved all issues discussed on the 6 January conference call.

On 9 May 2012, the Parties advised that they wished to make simultaneous final submissions on

the remaining document production issues on 16 May 2012. On that date, they each did so and

 

provided a final Redfern Schedule.

of Mr. Li Xiaoming. In their Reply, the Claimants objected to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction with

respect to the Respondent’s counterclaims.

be held from 23 February 2013 through 1 March 2013 in Singapore.

On 6 October 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, concerning the production of

documents.

Also on 6 October 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, declining to issue the

“reminder” requested by the Claimants in their letter of 31 August 2012.

On 14 December 2012, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder, accompanied by the witness
statements of Mr. Ch. Khurts and Mr. Nergui B and the expert reports of Ms. Anthea Roberts,

Ms. Natsagdorj Taivan, Ms. Tsevegjav Darijav, and Mr. R Zorigt.

On 7 January 2013, Mr. Donovan wrote to the Parties, disclosing that:

Debevoise & Plimpton LLP has taken on the representation of a party to an investor-state
arbitration arising under a treaty that includes a provision identical to Article 8(3) of the
Agreement between the Government of the Mongolian People’s Republic and the
Government of the People’s Republic of China Concerning the Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 26 August 1991.

Mr. Donovan further requested that, if this disclosure raised an issue of concern to any party, the

Tribunal be notified by no later than 15 January 2013.

On the same day, Mr. Clodfelter wrote to the Parties, disclosing (a) that his firm, Foley Hoag
LLP, had been retained under a treaty that, while it “does not have language resembling that of
Article 8(3),” “supersedes a previous treaty between the same States that does have language like
that of Article 8(3),” and (b) that a confidential award had been rendered in a previously disclosed
case in which he represented the respondent under a treaty containing language similar to that in
Article 8(3), as well as other, differing language, with respect to which some of the same issues

had been raised that have been raised in the pleadings in this case.

On 16 January 2013, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal to “confirm that they have no issues to
raise in relation to the disclosures made in Mr. Donovyan’s letter dated 7 Jan 2013, and

Mr. Clodfelter’s letter dated 7 Jan 2013.”

On 17 January 2013, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, objecting to “new arguments and
evidence that have been included in the Respondent’s Rejoinder” (the “Objection to the
Rejoinder”). According to the Claimants, “the Respondent has used its second round of written
pleadings as an opportunity to respond to the Claimants’ Memorial.” setting out arguments and

evidence that were not raised in the Respondent’s intervening Counter-Memorial.

On 23 January 2013, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal in respect of Mr. Donovan’s

disclosure, stating that:

after careful consideration of the circumstances in which we find ourselves, including certain
information that become public about Debevoise’s work as counsel following your January
7, 2013 disclosure, Mongolia does not think the steps outlined in your letter can adequately
address the issues that have arisen in light of the Debevoise party representation.

The Respondent accordingly requested that Mr. Donovan resign as President of the Tribunal.

On 25 January 2013, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, rejecting the grounds of the
Claimants’ Objection to the Rejoinder. In its letter, the Respondent reviewed the issues raised by
the Claimants point-by-point and concluded that, “the material submitted by Mongolia in its

Rejoinder was responsive to new assertions and arguments made by the Claimants in its Reply,

 

and to revisit arguments advanced by Mongolia in its Counter-Memorial.”

Also on 25 January 2013, the Parties exchanged correspondence identifying the witnesses they
wished to call for cross-examination. In its letter of that date, the Respondent also requested that
the Tribunal order the presence of Ms. L. Tuya as a witness (the “Request to call L. Tuya”),

notwithstanding that her testimony had not been presented by either side.

On 28 January 2013, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal further regarding the disclosures made

by Mr. Donovan and Mr. Clodfelter.

On 29 January 2013, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal regarding the Respondent’s Request to
call L. Tuya, arguing that the Tribunal’s procedural orders do not “extend to individuals who have
not been proffered as “witnesses” by the parties” and that the Parties “are not . . . entitled to request
the appearance of an individual who has not given evidence in the proceedings.”

On 6 February 2013, the Respondent wrote further in respect of the disclosure made by

Mr. Donovan and requested the formal adjournment of the hearing.

Later on 6 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, adjourning without date
the hearing scheduled to begin that month and designating the Secretary-General of ICSID to
determine any challenges to arbitrators. On the same day, following the issue of Procedural Order

No. 6, Mr. Donovan resigned as President of the Tribunal.

On 14 February 2013, Dr. Banifatemi and Mr. Clodfelter (the “co-arbitrators”) wrote to the
Parties, indicating that they “consider the same procedure to apply to the appointment of a
replacement arbitrator as was applicable to the original appointment pursuant to Article 8(4) of
the Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government
of the Mongolian People’s Republic concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments.” The co-arbitrators further indicated that unless the Parties disagreed, they would

“seek to reach agreement on the selection of a Chairman within the two-month period following

Mr. Donovan’s resignation, failing which either of the Parties may invite the Secretary General

of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes to make the appointment.”

On 18 February 2013, the Respondent wrote further to the Claimants, reiterating its rejection of
the Claimants’ Objection to the Rejoinder and requesting, in the event the Claimants maintained
their position, that they propose a schedule of further submissions to permit any additional

arguments or evidence the Claimants wished to raise to be addressed by both Parties in writing.

On 8 April 2013, Dr. Banifatemi and Mr. Clodfelter wrote to inform the Parties that they had not

been able to reach agreement on the selection of a new President.

On 5 August 2013, the Respondent wrote to the co-arbitrators, noting that six months had passed
since the resignation of Mr. Donovan and requesting “[iJn light of Claimants’ abandonment of
their case, and/or their failure to proceed with their claims” that the co-arbitrators “enter an order
providing for the discontinuance of this arbitration” (the “Request for Discontinuance”).

On 7 August 2013, the co-arbitrators wrote to the Parties inviting the Claimants’ comments in
respect of the Respondent’s Request for Discontinuance.

On 30 August 2013, Claimants wrote to the co-arbitrators, asserting that “[i]n no way could .
[they] be said to have abandoned their case,” and indicating that they intended “to invite the ICSID

Secretary-General to proceed to appoint a replacement President.”

On 5 and 6 September 2013 respectively, the Respondent and the Claimants exchanged
correspondence regarding the Request for Discontinuance. The Parties confirmed that they would
try to reach agreement on a replacement President of the Tribunal, and the Respondent reserved

its rights with respect to its Request.

On 16 December 2013, the Parties jointly invited Judge Peter Tomka to act as Presiding

Arbitrator. In the same correspondence, the Respondent reserved its right to ask the Tribunal to

 

hear its Request before the hearing on jurisdiction and liability.

On 26 January 2014, Judge Tomka accepted the office of Presiding Arbitrator.

On 11 March 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to clarify whether it maintained the

Request for Discontinuance.

On 17 March 2014, the Respondent indicated that it maintained its Request and asked that the
Tribunal order the Parties to undertake simultaneous submissions in respect thereof. On 20 March

2014, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal regarding the form of such submissions.

On 17 December 2014, prior to a pre-hearing teleconference scheduled for that day, counsel for

the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal disclosing a serious medical complication that would

prevent counsel from participating in the scheduled January 2015 hearing.

Later on 17 December 2014, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties,
addressing both the Respondent’s request for the postponement of the scheduled hearing dates
and various procedural matters in relation to the organization of the hearing. Following the

teleconference, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, postponing the scheduled hearing dates.

On 19 December 2014, the Parties exchanged further correspondence concerning the

postponement of the proceedings.

On 21 December 2014, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, proposing 8-13 June 2015 as dates for
the rescheduled hearing. On 26 January 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal, noting a

conflict with the rescheduled hearing dates proposed by the Tribunal and enquiring regarding the

 

possibility of hearing dates in July, August, or September 2015.

On 4 February 2015, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, indicating that it could be available for a
hearing on either 8-13 June 2015 or 14-19 September 2015. On 9 and 23 February 2015, the

Parties wrote to the Tribunal concerning their preferred dates.

 

On 25 February 2015, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, fixing 14-19 September 2015 as the dates

“[w]e do not rely on that provision of the Treaty at all in making our jurisdictional case.”>

On 7 December 2015, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal informing it that the Claimants’
witness, Mr. Bayartsogt, had been called in for questioning by Mongolia’s Independent Authority
Against Corruption. During this meeting, Mr. Bayartsogt was allegedly “presented with a
Prosecutor’s Order purporting to ‘reassign’ jurisdiction over the criminal investigation against
[him] to the Department of Investigation of the Independent Authority against Corruption.” The
Claimants noted that they considered this to be irregular and requested the Tribunal to issue an
Order restraining the Respondent from taking any “unwarranted steps” against Mr. Bayartsogt.
The next day, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, inviting the Respondent to provide its comments

regarding the Claimants’ request.

On 19 December 2015, the Parties each made submissions with respect to the costs incurred in

the proceedings up to that date.

On 21 December 2015, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal, requesting additional time to

respond to the Claimants’ letter of 7 December 2015.
On 22 December 2015, the Claimants submitted a corrected version of its costs submissions.

On 8 January 2016, the Respondent responded to the Claimants’ letter of 7 December, objecting
to the Claimants’ request on the grounds that “the domestic criminal proceedings are proper
exercise of Mongolia sovereign police powers and are independent and unrelated to Mr.

Bayartsogt’s involvement in the arbitration.”

On 29 January and 19 February 2016, the Parties made further submissions regarding the
Claimants’ request of 7 December 2015.
On 3 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 in respect of the Claimants’ letter

99. The feasibility study submitted to the Mongolian government in 1997 by BLT in support of its
application for a mining licence (the “Feasibility Study”) describes the Tumurtei deposit as

follows:

The Tumurtei iron deposit is conveniently located in a favorable location in terms of economy
and infrastructure in the region of the Selenge Aimag at 95 km from the Dulaankhaan railway
station, 130 km from Darkhan town, which is a major industrial center (with a metallurgical
plant), and 8-10 km northwest of the 35 kV Khuder-Bugant high-voltage power transmission
line.

The topography of the area where the deposit is located is a little mountainous. The highest
point lies 1100 to 1250m above the sea level, most of the area being covered with trees.

Ore containing bodies of the Tumurtei iron deposit are mainly divided into two independent
sections: “East” Section and “West” Section. These ore bodies are located at 2.0 to 2.5 km.
from each other.

100. The location of the Tumurtei deposit in the north of Mongolia, adjacent to the Russian border,

can be seen in the following map, included as Appendix II to the Claimants’ Memorial:

The Tumurtei iron deposit is connected to the city of Ulaanbaatar via railway and road that
run through Darkhan town. Darkhan and Ulaanbaatar, 230 km apart, connect via railway and
road. The railway station located closest to the deposit is Dulaankhaan Station lying at 100

km. It is 130 km to Darkhan, which is an industrial town. The road from Ulaanbaatar to
Sukhbaatar runs by the deposit at 80 to 85 km.°>
The Tumurtei deposit is one of Mongolia’s largest iron ore deposits.**

MONGOLIA’S HISTORICAL ATTEMPTS TO DEVELOP ITS NATURAL RESOURCES

In 1924, the State now known as Mongolia declared itself the People’s Republic of Mongolia. In
the decades that followed, it maintained close political and economic ties with the Soviet Union*”

and effectively functioned as a “satellite of the Soviet Union.”**

Mongolia’s iron ore industry was relatively undeveloped during that period.” As the Feasibility

Study notes, the Soviet Union “said it would supply Mongolia’s demand for iron. As a result, an

 

ore and ing plant was not ped in M lia”?

Neverthel the Mongolian government did make efforts to study the Tumurtei iron ore deposit

 

 

during the Soviet era.*! The Claimants note that the Tumurtei deposit “has been studied since the
1940s," The Feasibility Study describes preliminary exploration of the Tumurtei deposit by the
Mongolian government in the 1970s." In the early 1980s, a government study of the deposit

confirmed exploitation of it to be economically viable.“

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Mongolia underwent a democratic
revolution and transitioned to a market-based economy.** That transition took a toll on Mongolia’s

GDP and its ability to finance its own development.** Nevertheless, even in 1990, the Mongolian

 

government envisaged the development of a ferrous metallurgical plant and an open cast iron ore

mine.*”

THE MONGOLIAN REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR MINING

In 1988, towards the end of the Soviet era, the Mongolian government passed the Law on Subsoil
of the Mongolian People’s Republic, which came into force on | July 1989 (the “Subsoil Law”).
The Subsoil Law specified that the State owns the subsoil” and the subsoil could be used in the
exploitation of minerals,* including by a non-state enterprise where legislation so provides.*!

Article 14 of the Subsoil Law addressed the issue of mining tenure in the following terms:

Grant of the mining tenure area for the
purpose of exploitation of a mineral deposit

A state inspection body on mining shall grant a mining tenure area for the purpose of
exploitation/development of a deposit of minerals other than widely distributed minerals.

The Executive Administration of the People’s Deputy Khural (Meeting) of the given aimag
or city shall grant a mining tenure area for the purpose of exploitation of a deposit of a widely
distributed mineral and shall register it with the state inspection body on mining. If a deposit
of a widely distributed mineral covers the territories of 2 or more number of aimags or cities,
the Executive Administration of the People’s Deputy Khural of the aimags and cities
involved shall jointly decide the matter regarding the issuance of the mining tenure area.

The Procedure for the issuance of a mining tenure area shall apply to make change to the
boundaries of a mining tenure area granted for the purpose of exploitation of a deposit.

The Ministers’ Council of the People’s Republic of Mongolia shall set out the Procedure for
the Issuance of a Mining Tenure Area for the purpose of Exploitation.

It shall be prohibited to exploit the mineral deposit beyond the boundaries of the mining
tenure area.

A mining claim for commonly distributed mineral deposits shall be granted by the
Administration Office of the People’s Deputy Khural of the city and registered at the Mining
and Mineral Resources Authority. In the event of commonly distributed mineral deposits
located in the territories of more than two aimags or towns, the issue of granting a mining
claim shalll be jointly decided by the administration offices of the respective People’s Deputy
Khural.

  

The regulations on mining claims shall be duly observed when changing borders of mining

gree with respect to the regulatory procedures governing mining rights during this

 

period and in particular whether mining rights could be conferred by Government resolution.

According to the Claimants, the Subsoil Law “provided that licences for the mining of non-

 

commonly distributed minerals, including iron ore, could only be granted by a special authority

  

in charge of mining and mineral resources,”>° and “the Council of Ministers . . . had no authority

 

to grant mining licences,”™ In contrast, according to the Respondent’s witness, “[b]ecause there
was no Law on Minerals prior to 1994, the Government of Mongolia have regulated these issues
by the approval of resolutions, which have had validity as a Law.”55

In July 1990, Mongolia held its first democratic election and began a transition to a market

 

economy. As part of this transition, the Mongolian parliament adopted a series of new legislation,

including with respect to minerals, mining, and foreign investment.

On 10 May 1993, Mongolia adopted the Foreign Investment Law, which permitted foreign
investors to invest in “all areas of production and all services” and in “all parts of the territory of
Mongolia,” except where prohibited by law.°° The Foreign Investment Law also provided certain

guarantees with respect to the treatment of foreign investments.

On 30 September 1994, Mongolia adopted the Minerals Law (the “1994 Minerals Law”), which
came into force on | January 1995 “to regulate the exploration for and the mining of minerals and

 

the protection of the environment in exploration areas and mining concessions within the territory

F. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DARKHAN AND INITIAL EXPLORATION OF THE TUMURTEI DEPOSIT

124. On 14 April 1990, shortly prior to Mongolia’s democratic transition, the Government of Mongolia

adopted Resolution No. 160 concerning the establishment of a Steel Plant at Darkhan and the

 

mining of the Tumurtei Deposit. As translated by the Claimants, Resolution No. 160 provides as

follows:

1. THAT the Agreement made by and between “Mongol Impex” Corporation under the
authority of the Ministry of the Economic Foreign Relations & Procurement and
Itochu Corporation of Japan on the establishment of a Metallurgical Plant Complex in
Darkhan with an annual capacity of 100.0 thousand tons of steel roll be deemed
commendable.

2. THAT the State Commission for the Social and Economic Development be obliged
to specify and implement the economic and social development plan so that an iron
smelting and rolling mill plant of the Metallurgical Mill Plant Complex be built and
presented into exploitation from 1990 to 1993 and a mill plant producing reduced iron
from iron ore from 1993 to 1995.

3. THAT an ore extracting open-cast mine relying on the Tumurtei iron deposit be built
by and before 1994 and the Mine and the Metallurgical Plant Complex be together
reorganized into a Metallurgical Mill Plant Kombinat.

 

»

 

The Respondent's translation of the same portions of Resolution No. 160 differs significantly and

provides as follows:

1. To support the contract concluded between the “Mongolimpex” Society of the
Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Procurement and the “Itochu”” company
of Japan on the construction of a 100.0 thousand tons of steel casting per year capacity
plant compound in Darkhan city by way of a loan from the state of Japan.

 

2. Toorder the State Committee for Social and Economic Development to build the plant
compound in 1990-1993 to produce ferrous steel casting and the plant workshop to
deliver iron product from iron ore during 1993-1995, and to include this project into
the economic and social development plan.

3. To establish an open mine to exploit the “Tumurtei” iron ore deposit by 1994 and to
establish the mine and the ferrous metallurgical plant complex as “Ferrous Metallurgy
Plant”.

Darkhan was incorporated on 15 April 1990, immediately following Resolution No. 160, and the
steel plant (the “Darkhan Plant”) commenced operation on 4 July 1994.87 The Darkhan Plant
was designed to produce steel from scrap metal or from reduced iron, i.e., iron derived from the

reduction of the oxidation state of iron oxide ore.

The Parties disagree as to whether or not Resolution No. 160 accorded Darkhan rights with respect
to the Tumurtei deposit, and also on the extent to which the Tumurtei deposit was explored before
BLT applied for a licence to explore and mine it. According to the Claimants, “Resolution 160
did not confer specific rights on any entity, much less on [Darkhan]”** and Darkhan “had not been
carrying out work on the Tumurtei deposit for ‘more than a decade’ in 1995.”*? In contrast,
according to the Respondent, “the Council of Ministers gave final approval on April 14, 1990

 

both to build a plant in Darkhan city and to assign the Tumurtei deposit to the newly-formed state

  

  

company created to run the complex.”” Thereafter, “Darkhan continued in 1991 to do exploration
work at the Tumurtei iron ore deposit in order to prepare the area for mining and to establish the

grade of iron ore it would have to process at the steel plant and separation facility.”*!

Notwithstanding the Parties’ different understanding of events at the time, the record includes
certain correspondence from Darkhan in 1991 (during the period when Mr. Ganjuurjav was

General Director) concerning the Tumurtei deposit:

(a) On 18 March 1991, Darkhan wrote to the Geology Survey Expedition stating that:

There is a need to select proper techniques and technologies based on research on
attribution of iron ore at Tumurtein [sic] and Tumurtolgoi, near the Black Iron
Combination, Darkhan City, as the production using iron ore and utilization of second
shift of this factory is going to start in 1995. Therefore, please get 350 kg iron ore
sample from each deposit that has medium chemical component and can be mined
and used during the utilization based on agreement that is going to be established with
your organization.”

On 21 May 1991, Darkhan wrote to the Executive Administration, ADH, Darkhan City,
stating that “[t]he mining of iron ore at Tumurtei shall start in 1995.”

On 7 November 1991, Darkhan wrote to the “Mongol Impex” Union, seeking quotations
from foreign suppliers for an iron separation plant, “which will be second plant of Black

Tron Fa

 

ctory, Darkhan City, that separates iron ore, Tumurtei and Tumurtolgoi, using coal
of Shariin Gol.” Darkhan went on to specify that “[t]he capacity of the factory can be 75-
150 ton and the separated product must be composed of more than 93% iron, competent to
make good quality steel in electric arc oven, and can be used as substitute of residual iron

and main row material.”

128. The Minutes of the Meeting of the Geological, Scientific and Technical Council at the Ministry

of Energy, Geology, and Mining on 21 July 1994 (the “Minutes”)** discussed a “Report on the

Findings of the Detailed exploration completed at Tumurtei Iron Deposit and Prospecting and

Evaluation completed at the Khust-Uuul Iron Ore Occurrences from 1990 to 1992”, authored by
“Khuderbat N. and Noostoi Ts” (the “1990-1992 Report”). The Minutes relate that “in March

1990, a detailed exploration and a i uation work were

di d at the Tumurtei

iron deposit . . .in accordance with the proper methodologies” and “the deposit was prepared for

extraction.” The Minutes further state:

The report contains necessary information regarding geological formation, minerals
distribution, shape and size of orebodies, mineralization, chemical constituents, technological
aspects of ore, contents of trace minerals and contaminants, and mining technical condition
and hydrogeological condition of the deposit, etc.°”

129. According to the Feasibility Study subsequently submitted by BLT, “[t]he detailed exploration

completed at the Tumurtei iron deposit was discussed at the meeting of the State Minerals Council

of Mongolia dated 13 February 1995 and its resources were approved.””*

130. The record also includes certain government resolutions and correspondence from Darkhan in
1995 and 1996 (during the period when Mr. Shagdar was General Director) concerning the

Tumurtei deposit:

(a) On 3 February 1995, Darkhan wrote to the Mongolian National Development Authority,

reporting on the deposit as follows:

As stated in the order # 160, 1990, by the Minister’s Counsel, PRoM (In old name),
steel cast factory should be established in 1990-1993, resource survey of iron ore
should be conducted in 1990-1992 and iron separation from ore factory shall be built
starting from 1994. Corresponding to above order, the detailed survey at Tumurtei
Iron Ore Deposit, located at north east, 130 km, from Darkhan, had done, and related
research on possibilities to build Separated Iron Factory had conducted.

There is necessity to supply Metallurgical Factory with enough row material by
substituting residual iron with separated iron, as today’s Mongolian condition is short
of it.

 

Capacity of the Separated Iron Factory have selected as 225000 ton and Mining
capacity as 562500 ton. According to this option, total of 27.6 million USD exporting
trade and 9.4 billion tugrug of profit shall be made by sparing from domestic use in
case of Separated Iron Factory and Mining Plant establishment, and these conditions
are formulating core foundation to build such factory immediately.

 

The technical and economical basis for the Separated Iron Factory and Tumurtei
Mining shall be developed based on foreign donation and credit, and related data and
researches shall be submitted by our side. Mongolians shall contribute in making
related conclusions and doing technical and economical calculation suited for
Mongolian condition.”

 

(b) On 9 February 1995, Darkhan wrote to the Ministry of Environment, requesting climate,

soil, and earthquake data in relation to the Tumurtei deposit as follow:

 

The second shift factory and mining of our Combination are planned to build at
industry region, Darkhan soum, Darkhan-Uul aimag, and Tumurtei Deposit, Khuder

BLT’s APPLICATION FOR A LICENCE TO MINE THE TUMURTEI DEPOSIT

BLT and Mr. Khuderbat used the 1990-1992 Report (see paragraph 128 above) to prepare the
Feasibility Study, which the Parties agree formed part of BLT’s application for a licence to mine
the Tumurtei deposit. According to the Claimants’ witness, Mr. Bayartsogt: “Gangold, Bayarkhuu
and Khuderbat . . . visited the archives and reviewed various reports on behalf of BLT.”!* The
Feasibility Study lists Mr. Khuderbat as among its authors.!?

The Mongolian government granted BLT “special permission” to mine the Tumurtei deposit in
1997. On 21 June 1997, the Minister of Agriculture and Industry issued Order No. A/108 and a
Certificate of Special Permission of Deposit Mining No. T-30 (the “T-30 Certificate”) that

  

Claimants assert gave BLT mining rights over the Tumurtei deposit.!' The T-30 Certificate

BLT’s OPERATIONS AND THE FORMATION OF TUMURTEI KHUDER

On 20 July 1997, shortly after the suspension of the T-30 Certificate, BLT concluded an
agreement with China Heilongjiang entitled “Contract on the Joint Development of the Tumurtei

Iron-Ore Deposit.”!2° Mr. Li was involved in the conclusion of this agreement and, according to

 

his testimony, was an assistant to the General Manager of China Heilongjiang, and authorized by
the company to conclude the agreement. The Parties disagree as to whether this was a binding
agreement or an informal memorandum of understanding, but the record does not indicate that

any activity was undertaken pursuant to the agreement.

On 2 December 1997, Mr. Li incorporated Qinlong, and on 1 June 1998, BLT and Qinlong

 

an “ it on the Joint Di p) of Me lia Tumurtei Iron Ore.”!?!

 

According to the Claimants, “[a]lthough the parties did not ultimately carry out activities under

the 1998 JVA, Qinlong financed preparatory works for the mine in the years that followed.

On 15 June 1998, BLT concluded a second agreement with China Heilongjiang, '”3 again with no
activity in fact being undertaken. According to the Claimants’ witness, Mr. Bayartsogt, BLT’s
agreements with China Heilongjiang at this point “were all in the nature of co-operation
agreements, and were effectively superseded by later agreements, as the project progressed

further.”!*

On 18 June 2002, BLT, MCS Holding LLC and Boroo Mining LLC concluded a consortium

147. On 4 October 2005, BLT wrote to the Ministry of Finance, reporting on the work that had been

done as follows:

In recent years, we have elaborated research and economic survey for exploiting the deposits
and completed the project of the factory and plan of building the town. By implementing this,
project we can exploit 1.5 million tons of iron ore concentrate from open-pit mine annually
and export 800 thousand tons of iron pellets. If we use the project capacity fully, we can
achieve to make 70 billion tugrugs of sales annually. The reserve of the deposit is 232 million
tons which will be exploited for 60 years for the capacity of the project. If we continue to
conduct the comprehensive exploration in the area, the reserve may be increased up to 3-4
times.

  

At present, the investment of totally around 15 billion tugrugs of was made for settling
machines, works, project road and railway
and power generation, and it will reach 150 billion tugrugs.

 

We obtained the license to build a 96-kilometer-railway from Dulaankhaan (Yeroo railway
station) to the deposit by Government Resolution of 194 of 2003. Accordingly, we have
finished the railway truss and road construction. We also obtained the licenses to build the
road from aimag and soums. This year we have started extension work of Dulaankhaan
railway with cooperation of Ulaanbaatar railway with budget of approximately 60 million
tugrugs. We are also going to start the road building from November. This road will have 5
crossroads that will cross territories of five soums such as Shaamar, Javkhlant, Yeroo and
Khuder of Selenge aimag with the distance of 24.5 kilometers. Main transportation will be
from Tumurtei deposit. However, it will also transport 100 thousand tons of local
transportation a year.

When building railways of Sukhbaatar- Zamiin Uud and Darkhan-Erdenet, common minerals
used for the dams were provided free of charge. Therefore, we requested the local meeting
to discount or release from the payment of common minerals for 96 kilometer-railway dam.
If our request is accepted positively, the transportation fee will be same as Ulaanbaatar
railway tariff.

 

Our company built a new 50-kilometer road to Tumurtei deposit and renovated a 70 kilometer
road to Dulaankhaan. Therefore, any issues related to road are completely decided. We have
spent for road development around 480 million tugrugs.

We also finally settled the electricity by connecting with Sukhbaatar-Khuder 35KW line. We
spent 120 million tugrugs for this project. In future, we are planning to connect with Darkhan-
Bugant’s 110KW line and Galuut-Khuder line of the Russian Federation. This will be reliable
connection of electricity. The demand of annual usage of electricity will be around 17 million
kWhs.

  

Moreover, we have been doing exploration work for increasing hydrogeology and iron ore
reserves. We spent 2500 million tugrugs for this work.

THE REVOCATION OF TUMURTEI KHUDER’S LICENCE

In early 2001, Mr. Natsagdorj was replaced as General Director of Darkhan by Mr. Erdenetsog
D. (“Erdenetsog”).'°!

On 13 April 2001, following Mr. Erdenetsog’s assumption of the directorship, Darkhan wrote to
the Mineral Resources Authority of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, complaining of the

 

uance of the 939A Licence to BLT and requesting that the licence be terminated. Darkhan’s

letter provided as follows:

Paragraph Two of Resolution # 160 of the Ministers’ Council of the People’s Republic of
Mongolia states, “That . . . an iron smelting and rolling mill plant of the Metallurgical Mill
Plant Complex be built and presented into exploitation from 1990 to 1993 and a mill plant
producing reduced iron from iron ore from 1993 to 1995”, and Paragraph Three further states,
“an ore extracting open-cast mine relying on the Tumurtei iron deposit be built by and before
the end of 1994 and the Mine and the Metallurgical Plant Complex be together reorganized
into a Metallurgical Mill Plant Kombinat.”

 

With the purpose of enforcing the above provisions, the Plant assigned funds, made efforts,
engaged what is currently known as “Almaz” Company to complete a detailed exploration
and resource estimation, and safeguarded the samples and other results under its control,
protected by a watchman.

 

 

The Plant had laboratory and semi-industrial experimental tests completed by Davy McKay
of the UK, Mannes Demag and Lurgi of Germany, Kiwasaki of Japan, Simmko of India, and
Hyprorud of the Russian Federation /Leningrad/ to evaluate whether the Tumurtei and
Tumurtolgoi deposits would qualify for direct reduction and they were able to draw certain
conclusions.

An international bid was announced with respect to the establishment of the direct reduction
plant and the above-mentioned corporations and companies submitted their quotes.

 

However, the Department of Geology and Mining Cadastre issued licenses over DMP’s
Tumurtei, Bayangol, and Khust-Uul iron deposits to “BLT” LLC and the Tumurtolgoi
deposit to “Khar-Morit” LLC in 1997 allowing these companies to exploit the deposits for
the period of 100 years free of charge.

 

Mongolia is now running out of scrap iron resources and we have been planning to engage
in extraction and processing of iron ore. However, the prospects of the Plant have become
vague and the Plant is soon to have to cease its operation because the above-mentioned iron
deposits have gone to the control of private companies.

   

 

The above-mentioned companies, which have obtained the licenses, have failed to carry out
any mining operations during the course of 3 to 4 years.

Budget between the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority and Tumurtei Khuder 5 June 2006

The right to the use of subsoil can now be terminated on the ground that “there is an
unavoidable necessity to retrieve the subsoil for the State or public purposes” as provided for
in Article 1.3, Chapter One of the Law of Mongolia on Subsoil and on the ground of failure
to “commence mining operations within 3 years following the issuance of subsoil” as set out
in Article 2.1.

Therefore, we hereby request you to reconsider the licenses issued to “BLT” LLC and “Khar
Morit” LLC under these provisions of the law for the purpose of improving the prospects of
the only metallurgical plant in Mongolia, and to give us a reply to assist us with our
business.!6?

152. On8 May 2001, Darkhan also wrote to the Mongolian Metallurgists’ Association, notifying them
that the private companies holding the licence to the Tumurtei deposit had not commenced work
and secking the Association’s assistance in protecting Darkhan’s interests.'°

153. On 22 May 2001, the Department of Geology and Mining Cadastre responded to Darkhan as

follows:

 

J

No letters, applications, or requests applying for licenses of exploration or mining over the
deposits in the Tumurtei and Khustai areas in the territory of Khuder Soum, Selenge Aimag
had been submitted to the Mineral Resources Authority or its Department of Geology and
Mining Cadastre by Darkhan Metallurgical Plant /State-owned Enterprise/ in Darkhan-Uul
Aimag before the abovementioned licenses were thus issued. The license holders - NGB
Spectrum LLC and BLT LLC ~ haven’t lost their rights to possession of these licenses and
Licenses 2914X, 939X, and 940X are still valid.

 
    

In your letter to our Department, you request us to reconsider our decision, under which the
abovementioned licenses were issued, while referring to the specific grounds for terminating
the right to use the subsoil on the basis of Article 21 of the Law on Subsoil.

1. The Law on State and Local Properties states that it is the sovereignty of the
Government to make a decision to expropriate items of other’s ownership into state
ownership or submit to the Parliament to expropriate items of other’s ownership into
state ownership and that the right to such decision rests with the Parliament only.

 
  

According to the provisions of this law, the right to expropriation of other’s licensed
areas for State purposes is granted to the Parliament and the Government. However,
no resolutions or decisions of the Parliament or the Government regarding any
unavoidable necessity to retrieve licensed areas for exploration or mining activities or
iron deposits in Darkhan-Uul and Selenge Aimags, for State purposes have been
received by the Mineral Resources Authority or its Cadastre Division. Nor have any
such resolutions or decisions of local self governance bodies or local administration
regarding any unavoidable necessity to retrieve subsoil for the public purposes been
received.

2. It has been 3 years since BLT LLC, holder of Mining Licenses # 939A and 940A,
obtained these licenses from the Department of Geology and Mining Cadastre. In the
meantime, no letters, acts or formal demands of any state body or specialized
inspection body, or recommendations, conclusions, or notifications of local
administrative bodies setting out justifiable grounds or evidences regarding BLT
LLC’s failure to carry out mining operations or failure to conduct proper and efficient
activities in accordance with the terms and conditions and procedures set out in the
law have been received by us. Therefore, it is deemed that it is not p
Department of Geology and Mining Cadastre to terminate the rights of the license
holders under Article 21 of the Law on Subsoil on the grounds of alleged failure to
use the subsoil within 3 years following the issuance or on the grounds of unavoidable
necessity to retrieve the subsoil for the State or public purposes. !*

  

 

Thereafter, on 7 February 2002, Darkhan wrote to the Ministry of Trade and Industry providing
further documents in relation to Resolution No. 160 and the Tumurtei deposit, and requesting that
the Ministry “assist our effort to operate at the Tumurtein [sic] Deposit by nullifying the Mining
Licenses, #939A and #940A, allowed to the ‘BLT’ LLC by the Cadastre Division.”!*

On 14 March 2002, the Governor of Khuder soum adopted Darkhan’s position on the Tumurtei

deposit and wrote to the Governor of Selenge aimag, requesting that a proposal to transfer the

  

939A Licence to Darkhan be presented to the relevant authorities.’ The Governor of Selenge
aimag proceeded to advance this request with the Chairman of the Mineral Resources Authority

and the Chief of the Cabinet Secretariat.'©”

Thereafter, the record includes no evidence of efforts to revoke the 939A Licence until 2005. In
October 2005, the Government revoked the licence over the nearby Tumurtolgoi iron ore deposit

and transferred it to Darkhan.'®*

On 24 April 2005, the Specialised Inspection Department of Selenge aimag wrote to Tumurtei

Pursuant to the guideline provided by the Chairman of the Specialized Inspection Department
of the province, a working group led by Batbold, Chairman of the Taxation Department of
the province, and accompanied by Turtogtokh D., state inspector of environment, geology,
and mining, and Davaadorj, specialist at the Governor’s Administrative Office of the
province, inspected on 05 April 2006 and drew conclusions on the operations of Tumurtei
Khuder Co., Ltd being engaged in development of Tumurtei deposit and Khustai Yuruu Co.,
Ltd being engaged in development of Khustai deposit.

One. About Tumurtei Co., Ltd and Khustai Yuruu Co., Ltd

BTL Co., Ltd with Director Bayartsogt was incorporated in 1997, obtained mining license
over Tumurtei area in Khuder sub-province and Khustai area in Yuruu sub-province, and
started implementing a project in 2001 at Tumurtei in Khuder sub-province, within which
iron ore is to be processed to make pellets. Within the project, an auto road and a railway
were projected to be built from Tumurtei to Dulaankhaan. As of today, a high tension power
transmission line from Bugant in Yuruu sub-province to Tumurtei, a two-storey construction
for the administration and a hotel, and a 45km improved road stretching from Tumurtei to
Yuruu have been built.

However, the foundation of the processing plant at Tumurtei, the major work to be
undertaken within the project, has not been laid out, the construction of the railway has not
been commenced, and everything except the study on alignment has been slow. Besides, it
was evident from the exploitation of iron ore that it is profitable for the Company to export
ore to a foreign country without undertaking any processing work. BTL Co., Ltd incorporated
Khustai Yuruu Co., Ltd in 2003 relying on Khustai iron deposit in Yuruu sub-province and
exported 28000 tons of ore in 2003 and 80000 tons in 2004. While failing to register the
business entity with the province and the local area, it incorporated Tumurtei Khuder Co.,
Ltd in addition to Khustai Yuruu and thus exported, in the absence of documents, 166400
tons of ore in 2005 in total. In Quarter 1 of 2006, as they reported themselves (the quarries
on-site suggest even more), they extracted 34100 tons of ore as of 05 April 2006 and
transported it to the People’s Republic of China without entering into Stability Agreement as
required under the Minerals Law.

 

Two. Breaches discovered during the Inspection

1. Engaging in exploitation while failing to pay land fees is in breach of Article 3.1.8,
Article 7.1, and Article 27.2 of the Land Law of Mongolia.

2. The failure to cause to set the marks of the boundaries of the mine area is in breach of
Article 27.1 of the Minerals Law.

3. (They) operated in the absence of resource estimation report within which the
resources of the mining are to be estimated, feasibility study, or survey plan.

 

4. (They) failed to deliver environmental impact assessment and environmental
protection plan to the province, sub-province, and ins
engaged in exploitation without obtaining perm
authorities. These are in violation of Article 30.4.6 and Article 30.4.7 of the Minerals

aw.

   
 
  

5. Provisions regarding the obligations of the persons engaged in mineral exploitation
and ownership with respect to environmental protection have not been fulfilled. This
is in violation of Article 30.2.3 of the Minerals Law /operation in the absence of
environmental analysis program/ and Article 31.2.3.

6. The Company failed to submit a report, in which it must specify the volume of ore
loaded quarterly for sales, volume of ore extracted, justification for estimation of sales
value, and the total amount of payment, to the Inspection Department of Geology and
Mining, which is in breach of Article 38.5 of the Minerals Law.

7. Khustai Yuruu Co., Ltd and Tumurtei Khuder Co., Ltd infringed Article 38.2.1 of the
Law on Establishment of Royalty Fee when they set the royalty fee in 2005 /instead
of setting the price of ore per ton on the basis of the market value of the given month
or internationally accepted principle, they set the value of US$30.5, which is a value
lower than the world market value/.

Three. CONCLUSION

1. Although Tumurtei Khuder Co., Ltd has environmental imp:
the Company did not have environmental analysis program or environmental
protection plan of 2006 and performed unsatisfactorily with respect to preparation of
documents.

 

 

2. Tumurtei Khuder Co., Ltd failed to have workplace conclusions drawn by the relevant
inspectors at the Specialized Inspection Department of the province for its newly
installed equipment and machineries and failed to obtain permission from the
Governor’s Administrative Office or local sub-province.

3. It is hereby concluded that the ore mining activities at Khustai and Tumurtei should
be recommenced after Tumurtei Khuder Co., Ltd and Khustai Yuruu Co., Ltd remedy
the breaches of numerous provisions stated above, settle the outstanding amount and
compensation of royalty fee imposed on the Companies under acts, and export ore
under agreements made with the Ministry of Finance of Mongolia, not under
agreements made by and between the two companies involved.'®?

 
    

From 12-14 May 2006, an “Intergovernmental Working Group” carried out an inspection of the
iron ore export operations Khustai Yuruu and Tumurtei Khuder and produced a report. The
available portion of the report appears to principally focus on labour conditions and describes a
visit only to the Khustai Yuruu mine (also partially owned by BLT through a separate corporate
structure) in the following terms:

The main purpose of the inspection was to investigate the accuracy of the information

regarding a substantial amount of iron ore being exported to the People’s Republic of China

and to clarify if the permission for mining, a feasibility study, a detailed environmental

assessment, and other relevant permissions and documents are prepared in accordance with
the laws.

 

The working group members first inspected the situation of iron ore being exported from
Dulaankhan station to China via railway. State customs inspectors are assigned to the station
one at atime every week to scrutinize the iron ore being transported and complete the customs
clearance process. Approximately 34 railway carriages of iron ore is exported per day, each
of the carriages loaded with approximately 61 tons. For about this year, export loading took
place from 16 January to 15 March, and after a temporary pause, from 21 April to date. This
year, 1189 railway carriages or 72529 tons of iron ore had been exported by the time we
started the inspection on 13 May. Freight Handling Section Officer Nagvachimbee says that
a railway expansion was being carried out to increase the export loading capacity from 01
June to achieve a capacity of up to 100 railway carriages per day.

    

 

 

Regarding customs fees, US$5 is charged for the clearance documents for each carriage and
US$7 per hour for service fees. No other fees or charges are collected. Ulaanbaatar Railway
charges MNT 168 500 for transportation fees per train to get to Erlian, China. No other taxes
or fees are collected by Mongolia. This is because there is no legal provision that prohibits
or requires any type of special permission to export iron ore to China. This is due to a
‘Joophole in the legislation’. Put differently, one needs a takeoff agreement and a conclusion
issued by the Customs Central Laboratory in order to export iron ore, but not any sort of
permission. There is a lot of unemployment in Dulaankhan village and the residents have
negative feelings about the current situation where a substantial amount of iron ore is being
exported.

At present, over 50 heavy duty trucks haul iron ore each day over a distance of 100 km and
most of the drivers are Chinese people, who are paid a salary that is 5 times higher than that
of a Mongolian driver, according to the drivers.

The working group then headed to the centre of Yuruu Soum, where information regarding
the investment made by the Company to the locality and the Company’s business activities
was collected.

According to the sowm Governor Ganbold S., considerable investment was made to the local
area by the Mine of BLT LLC and its Chinese partner and job positions were created. So far,
MNT130.0 million has been invested for the construction of a hospital building, which was,
at that time, incomplete and halted due to a lack of funds, and as a result, the hospital is now
in operation. Additionally, repairs were done at MNT25.5 million to the building of the local
police office, which was burnt, to restore it into exploitation. A contract was made to establish
a factory for assembling small size tractors in the soum, but it did not happen.

Instead, 30 small size tractors made in China were leased to local residents. Over 30 local
residents were given jobs; however, their working conditions are quite poor, no employment
agreements were entered into, and the Chinese employers discharge them any time they want.

So that more local people were hired, the local administration required that no Chinese
drivers were allowed, and more Mongolian drivers were provided with employment.
However, the fulfillment of this requirement is inadequate. Additionally, waste is dumped
from the permitted exploitation site. This pollutes the environment and is in breach of the
law. The Company holds an exploration license over 200 thousand hectares in the soum. The
local Citizens’ Representative Meeting intends to safeguard most of the area under special
protection and is preparing a petition to the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority to
annul the license.

No other taxes are collected at the local level. A royalty fee is paid to the State fund in Selenge
Aimag.

The working group then visited the Khustai Yuruu mine located in Yuruu Soum. The mine
was first opened in 2004 and 35.0 thousand tons of ore was extracted in 2004, 165.0 thousand
tons in 2005, and 20.0 tons in 2006. At present, there is no loading taking place. No permit
was in place at the Mine. According to the Chinese manager, every document is kept at the
head office in Dulaankhan. One of the serious breaches discovered here is the fact that
blasting is carried out without any permit. At present, 13 tons of explosives are kept at the
mine, regarding which, Amgalanbayar B., specialist of the State Specialized Inspection
Agency, and Bat-Amgalan, the state inspector of the environment in Yuruu Soum, have
contained and issued an act.

Currently, 59 Mongolians and 27 Chinese employees are working here. No employment
agreement is in place, the Chinese chief of the mine dismisses Mongolian workers arbitrarily
at any time, and no permit is in place. On the basis of these facts, the mine operation is now
suspended temporarily for the period until the breaches are remedied and the machineries are
sealed in accordance with the applicable regulations.

From 8 to 11 June 2006, a “Sub-Working Group” was sent “to examine the operations of the
license holders over the “Tumurtei Khuder’, ‘Khust-Uul’ and “Bayangol’ Iron Deposits located in
the territories of Yuruu and Khuder Soums of Selenge Aimag, prepare recommendations, and
explore the dispute between the local residents and the license holders of the above-mentioned
deposits.”!”? The Sub-Working Group’s report was principally focused on explosives operations

at the Khustai Yuruu mine and provided as follows:

The main purposes of the inspection were to examine the information regarding the
unauthorized access to the explosives warehouse located at Khustai Mountain, which was
locked during the previous inspection on 12 May 2005 by the deputy chairman of the
MRPAM Gankhuyag Ts. and state inspector at the State Specialized Inspection Agency
Amgalanbayar Ts., and the subsequent unauthorized blasting works and to check the works
done as a follow-up to the previous inspection.

 

 

The Mine of Khustai Yuruu LLC extracted 35 thousand tons of ore in 2004, 165 thousand
tons in 2005, and 78 thousand tons in 2006 as of 13 May 2006, whereas the Mine of Tumurtei
Khuder LLC extracted 35 thousand tons of ore in 2004 and 165 thousand tons in 2005. Four
excavators, one loader, and two bulldozers are in operation at the Mine. A total of 35 dump
trucks are used in internal and external haulage at the mines of Khustai Yuruu LLC and
Tumurtei Khuder LLC interchangeably.

Khustai Yuruu LLC and Tumurtei Khuder LLC have transported approximately 2074 tons
of ore a day or around 41480 tons in 20 days from Dulaankhan railway station to the PRC
since the previous inspection.

While engaging in ore haulage with heavy duty (20 tons capacity) trucks from the iron deposit
to the railway station, they damaged 6 km of the paved road built in Dulaankhan village. As
aresult, the road is no longer in a good shape for continued exploitation. The residents of the
village started a civil movement and are fighting to get the road repaired.

The authorities of the above-mentioned two companies were absent during the inspection; as
a result, we were unable to access the documents pertaining to the operations of the mine.

Khustai Yuruu LLC operates over 216 hectares of the Khust Uul mining site referred under
license # 940A issued to BLT LLC in 1998 with 29 Chinese and 61 Mongolian employees
who work 11 hours a day with a one hour lunch break. Khustai Yuruu LLC is a Mongolian-
Chinese joint venture company with 30% investment made by BLT LLC of Mongolia and
70% investment by Qinhuangdao Mincheng Construction Engineering LLC.

The breaches discovered with Khustai Yuruu LLC and Tumurtei Khuder LLC were that the
Companies did not have in place any mining work plans, drilling and blasting procedures,
records for the explosives warehouse, or any records of the deposit & withdrawal of
explosives. Nor are employees given any safety instructions. It was discovered that they took
explosives and detonators from the explosives warehouse, which was locked by the state
inspector of the SSIA, and carried out blasting works at the mines of Khustai Yuruu LLC and
Tumurtei Khuder LLC on two occasions each.

 

While carrying out drilling work at the mine site of Khustai Yuruu LLC without any
permission from the state inspector, senior driller Baatarkhuu was injured when the drill rig
fell down and was taken to a hospital in Ulaanbaatar city. However, it appears that the
procedures for industrial accidents were not applied. The fire extinguishers in the warehouse
were not charged; nor were they certified.

  

Tumurtei Khuder LLC operates over 1180 hectares of mining site referred under License #
939A issued in 1998 with 35 Chinese and 57 Mongolian employees, who work 11 hours a
day with a one hour lunch break. Four excavators, one loader, and two bulldozers operate at
the Mine site.

There are 2 two-storey buildings designed for residency and office use, 2 containers for
storage of spare parts, and one repair and maintenance shop built at the mining site of the
Bayangol iron deposit referred under license # 8888A held by Montai Mines LLC. A canal
is dug to separate one side of the mining area. No production activities have been commenced
at the deposit.

 

The working group photos and videos documented the breaches discovered during the
inspection. To avoid repetition, the measures and actions specified in the report of the
previous inspection group are not mentioned here.

The working group hereby draws the following conclusions.

1. Khustai Yuruu LLC opened the explosives warehouse, which was locked by a state
inspector, and without permission, carried out unauthorized blasting works on two
occasions, and extracted iron ore. Therefore, Amgalanbayar Ts., a member of the
working group and state inspector of the SSIA, put seals on the explosives warehouse
and 5 items of machinery and equipment, including an ore crusher, an excavator, a
loader, and a bulldozer and suspended the operations of the mine temporarily.

 

2. Article 2.5.1 of the Law on Control of Explosives, Blasting Items, and their
Circulation, which states, “The premises and warehouses for the manufacture and
storage of explosives, blasting agents, and detonators shall have a safety zone,
identified by the means of calculation” was breached.

        

3. The following provisions of the Law on Control of Explosives, Blasting Items, and
their Circulation were violated: Article 11.1.2, which states, shall have blasting
agents and detonators specifically designed for the purpose of blasting, special
purpose vehicles, and security enhanced explosives warehouse”, Article 14.1
“Explosives, blasting agents, and detonators shall be kept in a standard warehouse
specifically designed for the purpose”, Article 14.2 “Business entities shall keep
accounting records of explosives, blasting agents, and detonators in accordance with
the General Rule for Blasting Works Safety Operations by clearly stating deposits,
withdrawals, and the remaining balance and shall carry out inventory quarterly ”, and
Article 14.4 “Provincial or capital city governor shall identify the physical location
for the place of manufacture or storage of explosives, blasting agents, and detonators.”

Failure to implement the Act will result in measures set out in the Licensing Law and the

163. On 20 June 2006, Darkhan applied to the City Administrative Court, setting out its view that
“[t]here is sound ground to consider Mr. L. Natsagdorj intentionally failed to re-register the
license by misusing own official position for his personal interest which caused nullification of
the license and obtained it into his possession rendered by his sister” and requesting that the Court
“invalidate the license allowed illegally to ‘BLT’ LLC and decide license holder’s right of our
Plant in accordance with law.”'”°

164. On 21 June 2006, the Ministry of Trade and Industry responded to Darkhan’s request to the

Parliament (see paragraph 159 above) as follows:

We have reviewed your request addr

  

d to the Prime Minister of Mongolia

In accordance with Resolution #160 issued by (former) Ministers’ Council of People’s
Republic of Mongolia in 1990, iron ore deposits of Tumurtei, Bayangol and Tumurtolgoi
were issued to ownership of Darkhan Metallurgical Plant.

However, the above iron ore deposits (Tumurtei, Bayangol and Tumurtolgoi) were lost their

ownership status and economic values due to wrong actions of some then-officials who
abused their power for their personal interests, as it appears.

    

 

Thus, it is required to take relevant measures in order to stop and regulate such illegal actions
which seriously violated laws and regulations.

To solve the i:
Law which hi

 

ue, the Ministry did reflect amendments in the revised version of Minerals
een discussed by the Cabinet meeting and submitted to the Parliament.

    

Under this law, certain provisions have been included in the law bill draft to legalize the state
policy and directions on deposits where exploration work has been conducted at the expense
of the State budget and so have their resources been determined accordingly.

Issues related with cluster deposits in Darkhan-Selenge region, such as Tumurtei, Bayangol
and Tumurtolgoi’s iron ore deposits, will apply to this upcoming revised law, if enacted.”
165. On 22 June 2006, Darkhan wrote to the State Property Committee, reiterating its position on the

Tumurtei deposit and the 939A Licence.'7*

166. On 3 July 2006, the State Specialized Inspection Agency wrote to Tumurtei Khuder, lifting the

suspension it had imposed on 15 June. The Agency noted as follows:

Since the Act [suspending mining operations] was issued, some actions have been taken: the
Contract on Land Use and the Contract on Water Use were made, and the relevant fees were
paid; a contract was made to run an internal inspection laboratory; a renewed contract on
product export was made; ore poured out along the road on the way to Dulaankhan was
cleared away; designs and plans of the plant were developed in Mongolian; and the camp
plan was reviewed by the Specialized Inspection Department in Selenge Aimag.

 
  

Therefore, on the basis of Article 27.1.3 of the Law on Environmental Protection, Article
52.1.6 of the Minerals Law, and Article 10.9.7 of the Law on State Inspection, we hereby
permit you to remove US-2 seals, put on ore crusher present at the mining site referred under
License # 940 in the presence of the environmental inspector in Khuder Soum for the purpose
of reference of the condition of the equipment, and restart your production.!?

On 20 July 2006, Tumurtei Khuder reacted to what it considered to be Darkhan’s misstatements
regarding the Tumurtei deposit and wrote to Darkhan, offering to supply it with iron ore (in an
unreduced form not then useable in the Darkhan Plant). Darkhan refused the offer.'*°

On 26 July 2006, the Department of Geology and Mining Cadastre wrote to Tumurtei Khuder,
suspending its licence for a period of three months on the basis of the State Specialized Inspection

Agency’s action of 15 June, notwithstanding the Agency’s further correspondence of 3 July.'*!

On 3 August 2006, a further Sub-Working Group was established —

with the task of organizing follow-up measures in relation to the complaints filed to
Parliament Speaker Nyamdorj Ts. and Prime Minister Enkhbold M. by Darkhan
Metallurgical Plant and “Cement Shokhoi” Stock Company in Khutul and others on the
matter of the issuing of explorations and mining licenses, for the purpose of conducting
inspections over deposits, on which the above-mentioned plants were established, and with
the task of preparing recommendations. '*?

 

On 4 August 2006, the State Property Committee wrote to the Department of Geology and

Mining Cadastre requesting the revocation of the 939A License in the following terms:

During the handover of the position of the executive director of Darkhan Metallurgical Plant
State-Owned Stock Company, it was discovered that the Tumurtei iron deposit, on which the
Plant was established, is no longer in the structure of the Plant. When we looked into the
matter, we established that it is decreed in Provision Two of Resolution # 160 of 1990 of the
Ministers’ Council of the People’s Republic of Mongolia (as formerly known) “That . . . an
iron smelting and rolling mill plant of the Metallurgical Mill Plant Complex be built and
presented for exploitation from 1990 to 1993 and a mill plant producing reduced iron from
iron ore from 1993 to 1995”, and in Provision Three “That an ore extracting open-cast mine

With the purpose of enforcing the above resolution of the Ministers’ Council of the People’s
Republic of Mongolia, the Plant assigned funds, made efforts, hired Almaz Company for a
completed detailed exploration and resource estimation, and safeguarded samples and other
results.

 

Nevertheless, it appears that your Division illegally transferred the licenses over this deposit
(939A and 940A) to a Mongolian-Chinese joint private company called “BLT” LLC on 26
January 1998. Although some authorities of Darkhan Metallurgical Plant repeatedly
submitted letters of request to the relevant institutions to revoke the illegally issued licenses,
no specific decision was made to date other than saying that the license could not be
terminated in accordance with Article 24 of the Law on Subsoil and that Natsagdorj, ex
Director of the Plant, was being investigated under a criminal case.

By failing to inform DMP when it issued the above-mentioned licenses (939A and 940A) to
the said “BLT” LLC, your Division has seriously violated the applicable provisions of the
Law on State and Local Property, Minerals Law, and Law on Licensing.

 

To be precise, this is in breach of the provisions of specific laws as detailed below:

Law on State and Local Property: Article 4.1 “Those that are designated as property
of all People and intended for public use in the Constitution and in other laws shall be
considered state property for public use.” Article 4.2 “. . . subsoil and its resources

     

Law on Licensing: Article 9.1.1 “ensuring national security and defense”, Article
reating a favorable environment for business”, Article 9.1.3 “ensuring

governor”

   

Minerals Law: Article 5.1 “Mineral resources naturally occurring in Mongolia on the
earth’s surface, in subsoil, or natural water are the property of the state.”, Article 16.1
“Upon satisfying the prerequisites set out in Chapter 4 of this law, a license holder
shall conduct its operations in accordance with its management and marketing
principles. . .”, and Article 22, Article 23, Article 24, and Article 25 of Chapter 3.

 

Asa result, ‘the eligibility requirement for holding a license set forth in Chapter 3 of this law
is not met’, as set out in Article 47.1

For that reason, we hereby request you to revoke 939A and 940A licenses illegally issued to
a Mongolian—Chinese private company, so-called BLT LLC, in accordance with Article
47.2.1 and Article 47.2.2 of the Minerals Law and to enable Darkhan Metallurgical Plant
State-Owned Stock Company to run regular operations, which will suit the national
interest.'5

On 5 August 2006, the State Specialized Inspection Agency wrote twice to Tumurtei Khuder,
noting the absence of “a license for the use of explosives and blasting items, which must be
kept in the mine facility of a business entity” and requiring that Tumurtei Khuder “1. To
submit relevant information to the State Specialized Inspection Agency by and before 15

August 2006 for inspection; 2. To obtain a license for the use of explosives”.!*4

The inspections were carried out within the context of the Minerals Law, the Law on Control
of Explosives, Blasting Items, and their Circulation, the Law on Environmental Impact

sment, the Law on Licensing, and the Law on State Inspection and the status of
enforcement of the above laws was checked.

 

According to the guidelines provided for the inspections, the following areas of the operations
of the business entities were inspected:

. On-site examination of the geographic coordinates of the deposits;

.. Exploration and/or exploitation processes and results;

. On-site examination of the fulfillment and status of the exploration plan and mining plan;
On-site examination of environmental restoration work in process;

s. Although Darkhan Metallurgical Plant and Cement Shohoi Stock
Company in Khutul have repeatedly submitted letters to the MRPAM since 2001, no
followup measures have been taken.

BLT LLC, the founder of Khustai Yuruu LLC and Tumurtei Khuder LLC, currently holds
exploration and mining licenses for iron ore in 9 soums in Selenge Aimag, including Yuruu,
Khuder, Javkhlant, Altanbulag, Shaamar, Orkhon, Zuunburen, Tsagaannuur, and Tushig.

Four excavators, one loader, and two bulldozers are in operation at the Mine of Khustai
Yuruu LLC. A total of 35 dump trucks are used for internal and external haulage by Khustai
‘Yuruu LLC and Tumurtei Khuder LLC interchangeably.

Khustai Yuruu LLC operates over 216 hectares of the Khust Uul mining area referred to
under license # 940A, which was issued to BLT LLC in 1998, which has 29 Chinese and 61
Mongolian employees working 11 hours a day with one-hour lunch break. Khustai Yuruu
LLC is a Mongolian-Chinese joint venture company with a 30%investment from BLT LLC
of Mongolia and a 70% investment from Qinhuangdao Mincheng Construction Engineering
Co., Ltd. 25 citizens of the People’s Republic of China are working on the buildings under
construction at the mine site. Among them, 11 had permission to work in Mongolia. Eight of
them were authorized to work for Tumurtei Khuder LLC only. The documents for the other
employees, are, according to them, kept by the management, which is the same excuse they
used during the previous inspection.

 

The following breaches were discovered during the inspection, which was conducted in
accordance with the guidelines provided:

1. With respect to the on-site examination of the geographic coordinates of the deposits:

While checking the coordinates of the deposit at the Department of Geology and Mining
Cadastre of the MRPAM, we discovered that the coordinates were changed only on the
sis of the Act on Marking of Comer Coordinates when the original coordinates of 939A
and 940A licenses were found to be different from those specified in the current licen:
New licenses must therefore be obtained. The mining area under License #1993A fal
under the jurisdiction of Orkhom Soum, Selenge Aimag. However, on the certificate of
the License, it says Saikhan Soum.

 

  

Article 27.1 of the Minerals Law states, ‘a mining license holder shall put corner
coordinate marks in the mining area in accordance with the technical specifications
established by a Specialized inspection body within 90 business days from the license
registration.” In violation of this provision, Erel LLC put the comer coordinate marks on
06 to 07 May 2000.

n

With respect to exploration or exploitation work processes and results:

Prospecting-assessment work has been completed by Khustai Yuruu LLC. However, it is
discovered that no preliminary and detailed exploration works were completed and that
the Company developed the feasibility study and mining plan on the basis of the
prospecting-assessment work and was engaged in exploitation of the Khust Uul deposit.

 

During the inspection, it was revealed that the above companies do not follow the mining
plan in their operations.

Erel LLC had the feasibility study of the Khutul II deposit completed by the School of
Mining of the Technical University in 2000. This is in violation of Article 39.4.1 of the
Minerals Law, which requires the feasibility study for mining of a deposit to be completed
within 60 days from the date of the license being issued.

 

w

. With respect to the on-site examination of the status and fulfillment of the exploration
work plan and mining plan:

Khustai Yuruu LLC and Tumurtei Khuder LLC failed to submit their [previous] years”
exploration work plans to the MRPAM. This is in violation of the applicable provision[s]
of the Minerals Law. Khustai Yuruu LLC prepared its mining plan for 2006 and had it
approved while Tumurtei Khuder LLC prepared its mining plan for 2005 and 2006 and
had them approved. The 2004 report of Khustai Yuruu LLC on iron ore extraction was
submitted to the Mining Department; however, it failed to submit the 2005 report to the
MRPAM. This is in violation of Article 39 of the Minerals Law. Another shortcoming
that is discovered was that the State Specialized Inspection Agency and the MRPAM
approved the mining plan without actually having reviewed it.

>

With respect to the on-site examination of the environmental restoration work in process:
The road repair and maintenance work undertaken by Khustai Yuruu LLC and Tumurtei
Khuder LLC is found to be unsatisfactory and the dust which results, adversely impacts
the employees’ health and residential condition and pollutes the agricultural field.

 

 

During the on-site inspection of the status of environmental restoration activities
undertaken by Khustai Yuruu LLC on the Khust Uul deposit, it was discovered that no
annual plan for environmental protection is in place and nothing is done in this regard.
This is in violation of the applicable provision[s] of the Law on Environmental
Assessment.

Although Khustai Yuruu LLC and Tumurtei Khuder LLC engaged Omego Eco LLC in
2003 and Shinechlel Eco LLC in 2004 to carry out detailed environmental assessments
over the Khust Uul and Tumurtei deposits respectively, no on-site environmental
restoration took place. Although Tumurtei Khuder LLC and Khustai Yuruu LLC stated
in their Report on the Environmental Impact Assessment that they would beneficiate the
iron ore, they are still exporting it to the People’s Republic of China in the form of ore.
This is in violation of the Law on the Environmental Impact Assessments.

During the inspection conducted in June 2006 pursuant to Directive # 38 and Directive #
39 of the Prime Minister of Mongolia involving representatives of the civil movements,
a meeting was held with the deputy governor of the soum, chairman of the Citizens’
Representative Meeting, the environmental inspector, and the tax inspector to listen to
their opinions and comments. The deputy governor of the soum and the chairman of the
Citizens’ Representative Meeting said that the authorities of Khustai Yuruu LLC were
leading local investors.

 

Although we tried to see the local authorities and officials concerned, no one was
available. We were given some excuses for their being unavailable. According to these
excuses, “they went to a resort” or “they went to see someone off”. When we listened to
the comments and opinions of the local residents and Company employees, they said that
Chinese nationals with no identifi

related infringes, are hired, sa
standard requirements for hygiene, labour safety, and safety operations are not satisfied,
no employment contracts Were entered into, little consideration is given to employees’
social welfare issues, and employees are dismissed for a s for taking part in a
movement. These breaches constitute violations of applicable provisions of the Labour
Code of Mongolia. During the inspection, the Chinese company authorities were not
present; as a result, we were unable to see any employment contracts. Therefore, there is
no ground to believe that the violations of the Labour Code revealed during the earlier
inspection have been remedied.

With respect to the status of production and trade of mining commodities:

Khustai Yuruu LLC extracted 35.0 thousand tons of ore in 2004, 165 thousand tons in
2005, and .. . thousand tons as of 04 August 2006 and exported . . . thousand tons to the
PRC. With the absence of an approved mining plan, it extracted . . . thousand tons of ore
in 2004 and 2005, which was based on laboratory test results and sales / purchase
contracts, and sold at a rate lower than that of the world market, all of which are in
violation of the applicable provisions of the Minerals Law.

x

. With respect to the status of storage, preservation, transportation, and expenditure of
explosives, detonators, and blasting items:

With the absence of a license for blasting activities, it carried out blasting works in 2004,
2005, and 2006, which is in violation of the applicable provisions of the Law on Control
of Explosives, Blasting Items, and their Circulation and Article 15.10.4 of the Law on
Licensing.

Yuruu sub-Aimag governor Ganbold, Environmental inspector Bat-Amgalan, and the
authorities of the Mine opened the explosives warehouse located in Khustai Mountain,
which was sealed and closed down by the state inspector of the State Specialized
Inspection Agency Amgalanbayar Ts. et al. during the inspection on 12 May 2006,
without permission and carried out blasting activities. This is in violation of Article 10.9.6
of the Law on State Inspections.

No drilling and blasting procedures, accounting records for the explosives warehouse
and/or explosives were in place. Employees are not given any safety instructions; fire
distinguishers in the warehouse are not charged; nor were they certified. This is in
violation of the provisions of the General Rule for BlastingWorks Safety Operations.

While carrying out drilling work without the permission of the state inspector, who
temporarily suspended the operations of the mine, senior driller Baatarkhuu got injured
and was taken to a hospital in Ulaanbaatar city. The procedure for industrial accidents
was not issued, which is in violation of the Labour Code.

Law on Subsoil, which states, “The failure to exploit the subsoil within 3 years
shall lead to the termination of the right to use the subsoil.”

 

-  Khustai Uul LLC and Erel LLC violated Article 41.2.1 of the Law on Subsoil,
which requires full geological surveys of the subsoil to be completed.

- Khustai Yuruu LLC carried out mining activities on the mining area licensed for

- The above-mentioned 3 companies failed to comply with Article 30.1 of the
Minerals Law, which states, “An environmental protection plan shall be prepared
by the mining license holder in accordance with the applicable laws promptly
before or after obtaining a mining license.”

-  Tumurtei Khuder LLC and Khustai Yuruu LLC were engaged in blasting activities

By entering into a Contract on Blasting Work with Blast LLC to hire it for blasting and
drilling after the Act was issued, the Company appears to have remedied the breaches set out

175. On 30 August 2006, the Ministry of Trade and Industry wrote to the Department of Geology
Mining Cadastre with the subject “Inspection Result”, as follows:

To deal with the complaints filed by some individual citizens and organizations to the
Parliament speaker of Mongolia Nyamdorj Ts., the Prime Minister Enkhbold M., the
Chairman of the Government Secretariat and a Minister of Mongolia Batbold S., and the
Minister of Industry and Trade, with respect to the Tumurtei and Khust-Uul iron deposits and
the Khutul-2 limestone deposit, four working groups were formed and sent to the deposits at
considerable expenses to carry out investigations pursuant to Letter of Assignment of Tasks
#3 of the Government of Mongolia from 2006 and Directive # 38 and Directive # 39 of the
Prime Minister of Mongolia from 2006. These working groups, consisting of the
representations from the relevant ministries, agencies, and civil society organizations, were
formed with the purpose of investigating the instances of granting of the explorations and
mining licenses over some major deposits; mining work plans; environmental reclamation
works; use, storage, and protection of explosives and blasting agents. A number of breaches
have been dis during these ig as the of the
working groups suggest. Upon examining the unified findings of those working groups,
several violations were revealed.

 

 

 

 

 

The following violations were detected in the operation of “Tumurtei Khuder” LLC, “Khustai
Yuruu” LLC and “Erel” LLC during the inspection:

* While it was resolved by Government Resolution No.160 dated 1990 designating the
Tumurtei, Tumurtolgoi, Bayangol and Khustai mountain iron ore deposits when building
the “Metallurgical Plant” in Darkhan city and the Khutul-I and Khutul-II limestone
deposits when building the “Khutul-Cement” lime plants as their raw material bases,
“Tumurtei Khuder” LLC, “Khustai Yuruu” LLC and “Erel” LLC acquired the licenses of
the above mentioned deposits for the above mentioned plants in violation of the
Government Resolution No.10,

Detailed exploration work to determine the Tumurtei Iron Ore Deposit reserve was
carried out by the state budget between 1990-1994, at an expense of 62.6 million togrogs,
however, “Tumurtei Khuder” LLC failed to make the repayment and violated Article 7,
“Law on Implementation of the Minerals Law”,

  

Prospecting and assessment work at an expense of US$7,100 on the state budget to
estimate the Khustai mountain iron ore deposit reserve , however, “Khustai- Yuruu”
failed to make the repayment and violated Article 7, “Law on Implementation of the

Minerals Law”,

+ “Erel” LLC violated the provision 2.1, Article 21 of “Law on Subsoil” which provides
that the “right to mine subsoil is void if the mining is not started for 3 years after the
subsoil was issued” by not conducting certain activities after it acquired the license for
the Khutul-II limestone depos

 

“Khustai-Yuruu” LLC and “Erel” LLC respectively violated the provision 2.1, Article 41
of “Law on Subsoil” on completing full geological research of the subsoil,

By conducting activities in the area with the “BLT” LLC special license, “Khustai-
Yuruu” LLC is violating Section 2, Article 11 of the “Minerals Law” which provides that
“No person shall conduct mining of minerals covered by this law within the territory of
Mongolia without a valid mining license.”,

The above mentioned three companies failed to implement and therefore violated Section
1, Article 30 of the “Minerals Law” which provides that “An environmental impact
assessment and an environmental protection plan shall be prepared by a mining license
holder in accordance with applicable laws as soon as possible before or after receiving a
mining license.”.

 

 

 

“Tumurtei Khuder” LLC and “Khustai-Yuruu” LLC respectively violated Section 10.4,
Article 15, of the “Licensing Law” and Article 11 of the “Law on Control of Explosives,
Blasting Items and their Circulation” by conducting explosive works without a special
license to conduct explosive works,

Even though in the “Environmental Impact Assessment Reports” of “Tumurtei Khuder”
LLC and *Khustai-Yuruu” LLC it was mentioned that the iron ore shall be concentrated,
these companies have repeatedly violated the “Law on Environmental Impact
Assessments” by exporting iron ore to China.

 

The working group has issued a recommendation that the Minerals Mining License No. 940A
issued by the Department of Geology and Mining Cadastre to “BLT” LLC in 1998, Minerals
Mining License No.939A issued to “Tumurtei Khuder” LLC in 1998 and Minerals Mining
License No. 1993A issued to “Ere!” LLC in 1999 should be revoked under Article 47,
“Minerals Law” as those companies are conducting activities which violate the current laws
of Mongolia.

 

Thus, we inform you to take measures under the provisions of the relevant laws and report to
us the results. ‘88

176. On 8 September 2006, the Department of Geology Mining Cadastre issued Resolution No. 902,

nullifying the 939A Licence in the following terms:

TUMURTEI KHUDER’S CHALLENGE TO THE REVOCATION AND THE ALLOCATION OF THE
LICENCE TO DARKHAN

On 14 September 2006, BLT and Tumurtei Khuder initiated a challenge to the revocation of the
939A Licence in the Mongolian courts.'?!

On 5 and 16 October 2006, Darkhan wrote to the Department of Geology and Mining Cadastre
and to the Mineral Resources and Petroleum Authority, seeking the licence to the Tumurtei

deposit."

On 29 November 2006, the Capital City Administrative Court denied the BLT and Tumurtei

Khuder’s challenge.'* The Court reasoned in relevant part as follows:

Lo]

After receiving license # 939A, “Tumurtei khuder” LLC initiated mining within deposit and
since January of 2006, it started export of iron ore to China.

In 2006, by the Decree #39 of Prime Minister of Mongolia, task force for studying and
specting activities of license holders of “Tumurtei”, “Khust mountain”, “Bayangol”,
‘Khutul” deposits, and dispute between license holders and local residents. By the decision
of Minister for Industry and Trade, task force visited above mentioned deposits for 3 times
on May, June and August of 2006 and produced report respectfully.

   

Task force consists of relevant state authorities, inspection officials and representatives of

civil society.

 

During this study and inspection, task force revealed continues and material breach of
Minerals law, Transitional law on effecting Minerals law, law on Subsoil, Law on
Environmental assessment, law on Control of circulation of explosive materials by “BLT”
LLC and “Tumurtei khuder” LLC.

 

This includes:

. Although license #939A and 940A were issued to “BLT” LLC in January of 1998, it did
not use the deposit until 2003. Therefore it resulted in violation of Article 21.2 of law on
Subsoil stating that “if subsoil was not used for 3 years since its allocation, then right to
use the subsoil can be terminated” which was proven by statements of parties to dispute
and other written evidences;

On 3rd of December, 1997, the Goverment of Mongolia approved “Regulation on
reestablishing amount of explorations expenses conducted from state budget and
repayment of it to state budget” by Resolution #234. “BLT” LLC concluded agreement
to repay explorations expenses for “Khust mountain” deposit equaling 7.1 thousand in
USD and agreed to repay it within 2nd of May, 2005. But it was repaid in 11th of August,
2005. Even though it could be seen as non responsiveness of license issuer on this matter,
on the other hand it violated Article 7 of Transitional law of effecting Minerals law calling
for repayment within 5 years from eflecting Minerals law. For “Tumurtei” deposit, on 5th
of June, 2006, “Tumurtei khuder” agreed to pay repayment equaling 667522 in USD
within 5 years. “Tumurtei khuder” only paid 37761 in USD as initial tranche of
repayment. It also rules violation of above mentioned provision. In other words, “BLT”
LLC supposed to pay all repayments within Ist of July, 2002.

 

 

w

. “Khustai Eroo” LLC initiated its mining activities in “Khust mountain” deposit of “BLT”
LLC, without any license, resulting violation of Article 11.2 of Minerals law of 1997
stating that “ts prohibited to mine without license within territory of Mongolia”. It’s been
proven by statement of claimant at court and other written evidences.

&

. Per Customs statistic provided on 9th of November 2006 of General customs
administration, “BLT” LLC exported 17372195 kg iron ore to China in 2004 and
“Tumurtei khuder” LLC exported 162390280 kg of iron ore to China since January of
2006. It contradicts with claimant’s goal to building eco-friendly plant and materially
violated Article 16.3 of Minerals law of 1997, stating that “license holder can sale
minerals extracted from its deposit after fulfilling obligations referred in Chapter 4 of this
law”.

w

. Both companies had environmental impact assessment, But none of them [rehabilitated]
used area. Therefore it violates Article 30.1 of Minerals law stating “license holder shall
implement environmental impact assessment plan”

C both broke twice into sealed storage containing explosives, which were sealed
by of [sic] State inspector and used explosives, violating Article 2.1.5, 12.1.2, 14.1 14.2
and 14.4 of law on Controlling circulation of explosive materials

 

 

Claimant and its advocates are raising grounds to repealing administrative decision #902,
which includes use of non applicable ad generally regulated law (law on Licensing) while
there are more detailed and applicable law (Minerals law) were existing. In addition to this
claimant raises issue over inclusion of official letter from the Ministry of Industry and Trade
as legal basis of issuing above mentioned decision, which certainly brought this decision to
fall under article 9.1.7 of law on Administrative procedure.

 

Article 1.1 of law on Licensing stated that “The purpose of this law is to issue license,
suspending and revoking such license in respect of business activities requiring specific
knowledge or specialty or activities that may harm public interest, health of population,
environment and national security of the country”. Article 14.1 of law on Licensing stated
‘that “License issuer will revoke the license on following grounds” and Article 14.1.4 stated
‘that “continuous and/or material breach of license requirement”. It’s clear that claimant
continuously and materially breached requirements and conditions of the license. Therefore
use of relevant provisions of law on Licensing by OMA in issuing decision #902 to revoke
license is justified. In other words, relations regarding to mining is regulated by Minerals
law, however some activity of license holder shall be regulated by law on Licensing on
limited bas

In addition to this hereby, the court concluded that reference ad us e of official letter from

conduct of the claimant. Therefore decision #902 of OMA is legally binding and in
consistence with relevant legislations.!°*
BLT and Tumurtei Khuder appealed this decision as far as the Supreme Court of Mongolia,

without success.'°

On 12 February 2007, Darkhan made a renewed application to the Department of Geology and

Mining Cadastre, seeking the licence to the Tumurtei deposit.'°°

On 30 April 2007, another company, EXIMM LLC (“EXIMM”), filed suit in the Capital City

Tumurtei deposit, in keeping with the 2006 Minerals Law.'*’ After EXIMM’s application was

dismissed on procedural grounds, EXIMM recommenced its case on 5 September 2007.'%*

On 12 May 2008, the Supervisory Court of the Supreme Court of Mongolia upheld the dismissal
(given in the first instance on 10 January 2008) of EXIMM’s claim on the grounds that, as the
licence to the Tumurtei deposit had been held by Darkhan in the first instance, there was no need
to conduct a tender.” Thereafter, Darkhan entered into a management agreement with the
Ministry of Trade and Industry, and on 27 June 2008, the licence to the Tumurtei deposit was

transferred from Erdenes to Darkhan.7°5

After the licence to the Tumurtei deposit was transferred to Darkhan, Tumurtei Khuder filed suit,

 

arguing that the Government had failed to conduct the necessary tender when the licence was
transferred from Erdenes to Darkhan.?° On 2 April 2009, the Capital City Administrative Court
ruled that the transfer did not give rise to obligation to tender.” Tumurtei Khuder’s appeal was

also unsuccessful.

At the same time, Tumurtei Khuder filed suit against Darkhan in the Inter-soum Court of Darkhan,

 

aimag on 18 August 2008, arguing that it was the owner of the stockpile of ore at the mine.

Tumurtei Khuder received an order on 26 January 2010, restraining Darkhan from disposing of

The Claimants recall that pursuant to Resolution No. 160, which envisaged the establishment of
ferrous metallurgical factory and iron-ore plant, the Mongolian government incorporated a ferrous
metallurgical factory in Darkhan in April 1990.2 The Claimants depict Darkhan’s operations as

dysfunctional:

DMP [Darkhan] experienced financial difficulties even before production could commence
at the scrap-metal plant. It lacked sufficient working capital and by 1996 was struggling to
pay the salaries of its employees despite the Government’s support. In addition, DMP was
unable to operate at full capacity due to a shortage of scrap metal required for the plant’s
operations. DMP became such a heavy burden on the state budget that the Mongolian
government asked the World Bank to carry out a viability study for the plant’s future
operation. The outcome of the study was a World Bank loan of MNT 1.7 billion to the
Mongolian state and a recommendation that Mongolia restructure DMP.2!”

 

 
  

The Claimants reject the notion that Resolution No. 160 granted Darkhan rights to mine the
Tumurtei deposit:”* “Resolution 160 did not grant mining rights over the Tumurtei deposit.”?!°
Rather, the Claimants consider that Resolution No. 160 established the government's intention to
build a ferrous metallurgical factory in Darkhan and an open-cast mine at Tumurtei.2° The
Claimants point to the language used in the 1998 Minerals Programme, which the Claimants
consider to indicate “the Government's understanding at the relevant time that DMP [Darkhan]
did not hold mining rights over the Tumurtei deposit.”'

In fact, the Claimants consider that Resolution No. 160 could not have granted mining rights to
Darkhan because the Council of Ministers was not empowered to issue mining licences over iron
ore deposits.2? In any event, the Claimants argue, Darkhan did not comply with the 1997
Implementation law, which required holders of all existing mining licences to re-register their

licences for their licence to remain valid.”

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent ascribes a different significance to Resolution No. 160:

After prospecting was concluded, the Council of Ministers gave final approval on April 14,
1990 both to build a plant in Darkhan city and to assign the Tumurtei deposit to the newly-
formed state company created to run the complex. . . . The resolution set up two phases... a
first phase to build the steel plant, which was completed in 1994, and a second phase to
exploit the Tumurtei iron ore.?*

   

 

The Respondent emphasizes the significance of Resolution No. 160 in the context of Mongolia’s
historical effort to develop Tumurtei deposit “as part of an integrated State enterprise.”> The
Respondent notes that Mongolia’s plans regarding the development of the deposit “spanned

multiple years beyond 1997.”?7°

Rather than generically describing the Mongolian government's intentions as regard the Tumurtei
deposit, the Respondent considers that Resolution No. 160 granted exploitation rights to Darkhan.

The Respondent notes that, unlike western economies at that time, Mongolia granted rights to

 

natural resources by means of government resolutions and not licences; thus the Mongolia
Council of Ministers was competent to act.”7 The Respondent traces Darkhan’s legal right to
begin mining the Tumurtei deposit to “approval by Mongolia’s Council of Ministers on February
13, 1995.””8 The Respondent claims Darkhan “secured the necessary land grants from the

regional government units to proceeding with building the mine” in early 1996.”

The Respondent also describes the scale of Darkhan’s activities during that period differently:

At the same time it was discussing plans to build a metallurgical plant with Itochu and
Mitsubishi, Darkhan Steel Company’s (“Darkhan”) predecessor was conducting further
prospecting and exploration at Tumurtei. A detailed map was drawn up of the Western parts
of the deposit in 1986 to 1989. Additional prospecting and exploration was conducted in
1988-1989. The results from this exploratory work were presented to the Minerals Council.”

 

 

After the Council of Ministers had passed Resolution No. 160, the Respondent claims Darkhan:

 

“further refined techniques for mining operations;””*! planned to build an iron-ore separation
facility as “part of the second phase of the plan set out in Resolution No. 160, i.e. the exploration

of iron ore from the Tumurtei iron ore mine;”?* entertained bids to provide technology for mining

work at the Tumurtei iron ore deposit in order to prepare the area for mining and to establish the

grade of iron ore it would have to process at the steel plant and separation facility.”

Quoting from Minutes of the Meeting of the Geological, Scientific and Technical Council at the
Ministry of Energy, Geology and Mining taken in 1994, the Respondent describes the 1990-1992

Study completed by Darkhan as a “detailed exploration and a prospecting-evaluation work.”**

The 1990-1992 Study evidences what the Respondent describes as “a decade’s worth of work.”?*°
The Respondent also describes a later feasibility study completed by Darkhan, which was

“circulated for comment and review in February 1996.”?57

THE 1997 FEASIBILITY STUDY AND BLT’S ACQUISITION OF A LICENCE TO MINE THE

TUMURTE! DEPOSIT

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants describe the genesis of the 1997 Feasibility Study as follo’

   

Under the 1994 Minerals Law, then in force, one of the main requirements for obtaining a
mining licence was to prepare an acceptable feasibility study for developing the deposits,
which was to be submitted to the Ministry of Agriculture and Industry. Bayartsogt understood
from government officials that BLT could improve its chances of receiving the licences by
addressing DMP’s [Darkhan’s] need for raw materials in its feasibility study. BLT thus
commissioned external consultants in 1996 to prepare what became the 1997 Feasibility
Study, which accorded with the requirements of the 1994 Minerals Law and the wishes of
the Mongolian government to help DMP. The 1997 Feasibility Study was submitted to the
Ministry of Agriculture and Industry in April 1997.7

 

 

 

The Claimants contend that they “consulted materials available at the archives of the Central
Geological Laboratory, including a geological survey Khuderbat had himself prepared in 1990-
19922 to produce the 1997 Fea

 

ibility Study.

[The 1997 Feasibility Study] set out BLT’s then plans for the development of the areas,
including an analysis of the iron ore that was to be found in the deposits and proposals for
processing and selling it. The 1997 Feasibility Study was a comprehensive plan that set out
the need for infrastructure development to exploit the deposits and ship the iron ore to market,
as well as the processing work that was to be carried out... . [T]he 1997 Feasibility Study
set out BLT’s intention to process the ore by means of electro-magnetic separation.2"°

 

The Claimants note that while the 1997 Feasibility Study assessed options for supplying raw
materials to Darkhan, it “envisaged that the plant would export the bulk of its production to China
and Russia.”™*!

The 1997 Feasibility Study formed part of the Claimants’ application for a licence to mine the
Tumurtei deposit. According to the Claimants, the Minister of Agriculture and Industry granted
BLT that licence through Order No. 4b/1261 on 8 May 1997.3 The Claimants recall that the
Governor of Selenge aimag granted BLT land-use rights over the “relevant mining areas” at
Tumurtei on 9 May 1997.4 On 10 May 1997, the Governor of Khuder soum issued Order No.
41, granting the sowm’s permission to BLT to develop the Tumurtei mine™ and on 21 June 1997,
the Minister of Agriculture and Industry granted BLT special permission to mine the Tumurtei

deposit through Order No. A/108 and the T-30 Certificate.“

The Claimants recall that “almost immediately thereafter . . . on 30 June 1997, the Minister of
Agriculture and Industry suspended the T-30 Licence without providing any justification.”™’
Nevertheless, BLT “decided to re-register its licence” in accordance with the 1997
Implementation Law, which required “all licence-holders to re-register their licences”** and on
19 January 1998, “the DGMC granted the 939A Licence to BLT.”*?

The Claimants vigorously contest the claim that BLT obtained the 939A Licence through

corruption, fraud, and misrepresentation.?”

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimants obtained their licence to exploit the Tumurtei deposit
through corruption, fraud, and misrepresentation.**! The Respondent alleges that the Claimants
took the material from the 1990-1992 Report by theft and misrepresented it as their own work in

the 1997 Feasibility Study.25?

The Respondent claims that BLT, Mr. Natsagdorj and Mr. Bayartsogt were involved in “wrongful
actions” and “corruption” regarding “key iron deposits.”*°> For example, the Respondent claims
Mr. Bayartsogt “had access to nearly all internal reports generated by Darkhan about the deposit”
and failed to complete the tasks that Darkhan set out for him with respect to the deposit,*
preferring instead to collaborate with Mr. Natsagdorj and Mr. Li “to secure mining opportunities
in Mongolia.” Similarly, the Respondent recalls that Mr. Natsagdorj:

stopped the actions that would have been required for Darkhan to retain the Tumurtei license,

as well as taking active steps to divert Darkhan’s rights for the Tumurtei mine to BLT.
egdorj failed to re-register Darkhan’s mining rights under the 1997 Minerals Law.
Natsegdorj made sure that Darkhan’s feasibility study and the materials from which it had

been generated were given to BLT. Natsegdorj allowed Darkhan’s land rights to the Tumurtei
deposit, as well as to the access roads to the deposit, to be cancelled.25*

     

 

The Respondent also claims that BLT and Mr. Bayartsogt corrupted Mr. Khuderbat, who Darkhan
had entrusted to collect and analyse confidential geological information for Darkhan’s own

feasibility study. The Respondent states,

Khuderbat failed to deposit the final copy of his report with Darkhan. Darkhan Director
Ganjuurjav tasked Bayartsog[t] with retrieving the document from Khuderbat — with no
success. Instead, Khuderbat gave the document to Bayartsog[t]’s company, BLT?” . . . the
Claimants paid off Khuderbat to obtain Darkhan’s proprietary geological studies, which were
later included in the 1997 feasibility study. Claimants used bid document submitted to
Darkhan, and removed from Darkhan’s archives during Natsegdorj’s tenure, as materials
the technical parts of the 1997 Feasibility Study.25

 

 

 

The Respondent supports its claim of theft with the assertion that only Darkhan had the right to
survey the deposit before the publication of the 1997 Feasibility Study so BLT could not have

authored the study alone.*°° The Respondent contends that the funds the Claimants said they spent
on the 1997 Feasibility Study were in fact used to corrupt Darkhan staff. Additionally, the
Respondent reports that information from a further set of confidential documents containing
“specific technological information about to mine the Tumurtei deposit” and belonging to
Darkhan appeared in BLT’s 1997 Feasibility Study.® The Respondent also notes, “Mongolian
officials brought charges against Nats[a]gdorj, Bayartsog[t] and Tuya in 2005 for embezzlement
and other charges for the theft of the license from DMP [Darkhan].”?°!

The Respondent points to what it characterizes as a series of misrepresentations in the 1997

Feasibility Report. For example, it notes that the 1997 Feasibility Study misrepresented BLT’s

sources of funding,”” its experience in mining,” the timeline of BLT’s operations”, the intent

to supply Darkhan with raw materials,” and the intended use of the iron ore.” The Respondent

concludes,

Claimants’ false representations are critical because the grant of the license to BLT was
dependent upon approval of the feasibility study . . . The license therefore was issued on false
pretenses and on the basis of purposeful concealment and affirmative misrepresentation by
the Claimants.*7

     

 

BLT / TUMURTEI KHUDER’S DEVELOPMENT OF THE TUMURTEI DEPOSIT

Khuder—entered into contracts necessary for their investment operations.”?°°

The Claimants describe Qinlong’s purchase of “all the necessary mining equipment,”

“establishment of a production line,” and study and survey of the Tumurtei deposit.”

The Claimants also assert that they contributed to Mongolia’s development to fulfil their
obligations under Mongolian law. In particular, they claim to have constructed: 48 km of dirt
roads, a 10km aerial power line, a railway line extension, residential apartments, a hotel and an
office building for employees, a hospital, a local clubhouse, a sewing factory, a police station,
schools, and street lights.”!

In terms of iron ore production before the revocation of the 939A Licence, the Claimants note
that “Tumurtei Khuder began, as of mid-2005, to commit more resources to the mine and to move

necessary personnel over from the Khustai mine”?””

and by “late 2005, major progress had been
made.”?”3 According to the Claimants, “[i]n 2006, until the revocation of its licence in September
of that year, Tumurtei Khuder mined 461.1 thousand tonnes of iron ore to make 322.7 thousand
tonnes of processed iron ore, 180 thousand tonnes of which it had exported.”*”* The Claimants
also note, with reference to the 2005-2006 work plan that “Tumurtei Khuder had plans to expand
its investment activities by building further processing facilities that would include a beneficiation
plant (meaning in this context a plant for the electro-magnetic separation of the iron ore), an

yp and p ially a reduced-iron plant or a steel-smelting plant.”?”>

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent values the Claimants’ investment at a fraction of the Claimants’ figure.”

According to the Respondents, the Claimants’ “‘inyestments”” and the amounts the Claimants

purported to pay for them “are not corroborated by documentary evidence.”?7”

THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF MR. NATSAGDORJ AND MR. BAYARTSOGT

The Claimants’ Position
According to the Claimants:

(a) “In 2006, at the request of DMP (the very party that directly benefited from the revocation
of the 939A Licence), the State General Prosecutor of Mongolia (Mongolia’s Prosecutor)
started a criminal investigation against Natsagdorj and Bayartsogt.”°**

(b) “The investigation focused on whether the alleged failure to re-register the licence that
DMP would have been granted by Resolution 160 constituted embezzlement on the part of

(d) “Two anda half years after the dismissal of the prosecution for want of evidence, magically
there is a review of that decision by an individual called Dorligjav, who was the senior
prosecutor and who has now become the Minister of Justice of Mongolia and it says, oh,

no, wrong decision. . . . He says the findings [have] been fully asserted and proven.”?*”

The Respondent's position:

According to the Respondent, “Mongolia prosecuted this violation of its criminal law until
Bayartsog[t], Tuya and Natsegdorj fled the country. This wrongdoing is also a basis for the

revocation of the Tumurtei license.”***

Additionally, the Respondent submits that “the irregular nature of the dismissal by the prosecutor
Enkhbat is suspicious, and for that reason cannot be credited.””*? In explanation, the Respondent
notes that

290

(a) _ the case was dismissed on the same day that the file was received by the prosecutor;

(b) _ the file encompassed eight binders of documents, or approximately 2,000 pages, that the
prosecutor cannot realistically have reviewed as required by the Criminal Procedural Code

of Mongolia;?"!
(c) _ the dismissal did not contain reasons;

(d) the case was dismissed during a period in which it was suspended—and therefore not

 

eligible for dismissal—because the subjects of the investigation had left Mongolia:2"° and

(e) _ Enkhbat was dismissed as prosecutor shortly thereafter.*

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION AND APPLICABLE LAW

 

1. Jurisdiction Ratione Personae
The pertinent part of Article 1(2) of the Treaty defines “investors”, in respect of the People’s
Republic of China, as:

(a) Natural persons who have nationality of the People’s Republic of China:
(b) Economic entities established in accordance with the laws of the People’s Republic
of China and domiciled in the territory of the People’s Republic of China.”
The Claimants assert that they are “qualifying investors” under Article 1(2) of the Treaty because
they are each “economic entities” that are “established and domiciled in the territory of the PRC

in accordance with the PRC’s laws.”*"!

2. Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae

Article 1(1) of the Treaty defines “investments” as “every kind of asset invested by investors of
one Contracting State in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting State
in the territory of the Latter.” The definition of “investments” in Article 1(1) of the Treaty
specifically includes “shares. stock and debentures of companies” and “concessions conferred by

law, including concessions to search for or exploit natural resources,”

The Claimants consider they have made a qualifying investment under Article 1(1) of the Treaty.
They assert they have made a “direct investment” in the shares of Tumurtei Khuder’s registered
share capital.*”? The Claimants also consider that they made a qualifying “indirect investment”
because the 939A Licence gave Tumurtei Khuder the right to exploit the Tumurtei mine and the
Claimants are shareholders in Tumurtei Khuder. According to the Claimants, “[t]he Treaty
expressly provides for the protection of indirect investments consisting of an ‘interest in the
property’ of companies.”*°?

3. Applicable Law

Article 8(7) of the Treaty requires that the Tribunal adjudicate in accordance with Mongolian law,
including its rules on conflict of laws, the provisions of the Treaty, and “the generally recognized
principle [sic] of international law accepted by both Contracting States.”

THE RESPONDENT’S PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

The Respondent has objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on a series of grounds, as follows:

a) that the Claimants’ investment was procured by theft, embezzlement, and fraud;

(b) that Mongolia’s consent to arbitration set out in Article 8(3) of the Treaty does not extend

to the subject matter of the Claimants’ claims;

(c) _ that Beijing Shougang and China Heilongjiang are not investors because they cannot be
classified as “economic entities” under Article 1(2) of the Treaty as a matter of Chinese

treaty practice;

(d) _ that the Claimants have not made a qualifying investment, insofar as they have not incurred

investment risk;

(e) _ that the Claimants ask the Tribunal to make a manifest error of law in requesting restitution

on the basis of customary international law;

(f) _ that the Claimants elected to submit the same dispute to the Mongolian courts and therefore
cannot now have recourse to international arbitration, referring to Article 8(3) of the Treaty

as containing a fork-in-the-road clause.

The Respondent also objects to the admissibility of the Claimants’ claims on the grounds that the
Claimants come to the Tribunal with “unclean” hands and that principles of fairness and equity

and ex injuria jus non oritur ius require the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimants’ claims.

1. Objections to the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction

According to the Respondent, for an investment to qualify under Article 1(1) of the Treaty, it
must be made “in accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting State.”*"* The
Respondent relies on Inceysa Vallisoletane, SL v. El Salvador to support the proposition that
“disputes that arise from an investment made illegally are outside the consent granted by the
parties.”*°* Citing Gustav Hamester v. Ghana, the Respondent also asserts that illegality precludes
jurisdiction even where the language on legality in the relevant treaty is limited.*°° The
Respondent asserts that the consequences of the Claimants’ theft, embezzlement, and fraud are
that: (a) the Treaty does not protect the Claimants’ investment; and (b) the Claimants do not have

a valid interest in what they assert is their investment.

Mongolian criminal law prohibits “embezzlement, conspiracy to commit embezzlement and
concealment of embezzlement”; “the acquisition of property by fraud, conspiracy to commit
fraud, and concealment of fraud”; and “the theft, destruction, damage or concealment of a
business entity’s or organization’s documents.”*” Citing the UN Convention Against Corruption
and the municipal law of the PRC and the United States, the Respondent argues that
embezzlement “also violates fundamental principles of law of civilized nations.”*°*

The Respondent alleges that Mr. Natsagdorj. the former director of Darkhan, “fraudulently
diverted” the right to mine the Tumurtei deposit, granted under Resolution No. 160 of 1990, from

Darkhan to the Claimants.*°? The Respondent claims that Mr. Natsagdorj:

(a) “diverted the intellectual property about the Tumurtei deposit, including Darkhan’s

feasibility study, tender documents and geological data, to BLT”: *!°

(b) “cancelled Darkhan’s land rights to the Tumurtei deposit as well as access roads to the

deposit”; *!" and

(c) “failed to register Darkhan’s right to the deposit under the 1997 Minerals Law.”*!?

The Respondent asserts that such actions were “presumptively fraudulent” because the Claimants
did not compensate Darkhan for the loss of its mining licence, for its intellectual property, or for
the release of its land rights for the surface land above the Tumurtei deposit.*!* The Respondent
considers that such actions were also actually fraudulent because they were “financed by bribing
Darkhan’s former employees,”** specifically Mr. Khuderbat, who the Claimants paid for his
feasibility study. According to the Respondent, it was for those reasons that criminal proceedings
were brought against Mr. Bayartsogt, Ms. Tuya, and Mr. Natsagdorj in Mongolia and that the
Claimants’ mining licence was revoked.*!> The Respondent adds that although the criminal case
against Mr. Bayartsogt, Ms. Tuya, and Mr. Natsagdorj was dismissed, this decision was
subsequently found to be illegal and groundless by general prosecutor.>!° The Respondent claims
that fraud was also the reason that the transaction documents establishing the Tumurtei Khuder
joint venture contained no representations or warranties about legality*'” and that the Claimants

paid comparatively little for their shares in Tumurtei Khuder.>"*

 

The Respondent also denies that the similarities between the feasibility studies of BLT and DMP

can be explained by publicly available geological data in the archives. The Respondent points to

  

the identical information regarding production facilities and collaboration with Japanese
companies in the BLT feasibility study and in Darkhan’s earlier documents and in Resolution

No. 160.5!

As a matter of law, the Respondent argues that the difficulty in definitively proving corruption
has led investment arbitration tribunals to adopt a burden shifting approach, rather than to require
a high standard of proof. Relying on Asian Agricultural Products. Ltd. (AAPL) v. Democratic

Islamic Republic of Iran,*"! and ICC Case No. 6497, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal
“may reverse the burden if the facts show difficulty in procuring evidence and once prima facie
evidence or reasonable inferences exist to support the corruption claim.”**? The Respondent
distinguishes the higher standard applied by the Tribunal in EDF (Services) Ltd. v. Romania™! as
having been necessitated by the involvement of officials at the highest level of the Romanian
government.”

According to the Respondent, “[t]he incongruity of the Claimants’ payments, Darkhan’s failure
to protect and retain its license, and BLT’s bid ‘out of nowhere’ that mimicked Darkhan’s precise
technical and financial—including the dates of the feasibility study—all point to underlying
corruption in this transaction.” Accordingly, the Respondent argues that “[t]he operative
question for the Tribunal . . . is not whether Respondent’s have [sic] proven that the 939A License
was illegally procured, but whether it has presented prima facie evidence of the truth of this

submission.”*””

The Respondent also asserts that the Claimants’ alleged embezzlement invalidates the validity of
the Claimants’ ownership interest in the Tumurtei mining licence such that they do not have a
qualifying investment that would permit jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims.°* The
Respondent relies on Anderson v. Costa Rica”? for the proposition that “an asset could not be an

"330 and argues that the Claimants do

investment when its very ownership was prohibited by law”
not legally own the Tumurtei mining licence through BLT because that licence was procured by

fraud, embezzlement, and theft.

Comparing this case to the facts in Inceysa v. El Salvador,* the Respondent argues that the
Tribunal should deny jurisdiction on the basis of the Claimants’ alleged misrepresentations.“*
The Respondent submits that BLT’s “fraudulent promises”™® to the Mongolian authorities
concerning the transfer of technology to Mongolia are both material and “an independent basis
on which the Tribunal should deny jurisdiction.”“’ Relying on the award in Plama v. Bulgaria,**
the Respondent also asserts that the Claimants had a duty to disclose to the Mongolian State the
change in the ownership structure of BLT and that failing to so do was a material

misrepresentation.*”?

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that the Respondent “has not proved any of its assertions.”**° The Claimants
note that the Mongolian authorities have not brought charges against Mr. Bayartsogt and
Mr. Natsagdorj, despite investigating them for five years and, in any case, allegations were made
not against the Claimants, but against individuals and BLT.**! The Claimants describe the absence
of representations and warranties in share transfer agreements as “probative of nothing”*? and
claim that Mongolia “has not produced any evidence with respect to its theft and fraud
allegations.”>° In sum, the Claimants submit that the Respondent has not discharged its burden
of proof in making allegations of theft, fraud, and embezzlement and is impermissibly asking the

Tribunal to infer fraud, theft, and embezzlement from scant evidence.

In the Claimants’ view, “[t]he Respondent is effectively asking the Tribunal to infer fraud from
(a) the Claimants’ not having submitted documents cited in the 1997 Feasibility Study and records

of the communications between BLT, Mr. Bayartsogt and Li Xiaoming before 1997; and (b) the

“there is general consensus” that a high standard of proof of corruption should be applied.*? In
the Claimants’ view, Anderson v. Costa Rica is entirely distinguishable from the present
circumstances, as the claimants in that case had been found guilty of an offence. Here, the
Mongolian authorities have dropped all charges against the Claimants. The Claimants also submit
that Order No. 1 of 2014 is not in accordance with Mongolia’s Criminal Procedure Law, and in

any case, only a court can ascertain guilt or innocence under Mongolian law.*

Feasibility Study were fraudulent, and has “not established the . . . core element of (fraudulent)
misrepresentation, namely reliance,” as well as intent to deceive.** The Claimants submit that
“[als the competent authority had no discretion to refuse to grant a licence because of the
particulars of a feasibility study, it could not on any view have relied on those particulars in its

The Claimants further object to the Respondent’s reasoning that fraudulent misrepresentation
justifies expropriation, claiming that the Respondent has failed to cite “any provision of
Mongolian law that would allow revocation of a mining licence under such circumstances.”>”° In
fact, under the 1994 Minerals Law, fraudulent misrepresentation is not a ground for revocation of
a licence and “false information and records” only give rise to the payment of a fine.*”' In this
respect, the Claimants consider the Respondent's reliance on Gustav Hamester v. Ghana, Inceysa
v. El Salvador and Plama v. Bulgaria as misplaced.>? They emphasise that the tribunals in those

cases required strong proof of allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation, not “‘inferences””>”>

and assert the Respondent has not discharged that burden.

(b) Whether the Treaty Provides Jurisdiction to Determine Liability for Alleged
Expropriation

Article 8 of the Treaty provides in relevant part as follows:

1. Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting State and the other Contracting
State in connection with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting State
shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through negotiations between the parties
to the dispute.

2. If the dispute cannot be settled through negotiations within six months, either party to
the dispute shall be entitled to submit the dispute to the competent court of the
Contracting State accepting the investment.

3. If a dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation cannot be settled
within six months after resort to negotiations as specified in paragraph | of this
Article, it may be submitted at the request of either party to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal.
The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply if the investor concerned has resorted
to the procedure specified in the paragraph 2 of this Article.

  

 

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the grounds that Mongolia’s consent
to arbitration set out in Article 8(3) of the Treaty does not extend to the subject matter of the

Claimants’ claims.

According to the Respondent, the language of Article 8(3) of the Treaty “expressly limits the

scope of arbitration to disputes over questions of quantum, with questions of liability to be

face is an exceptional provision,” and the “ordinary jurisdiction provision in the BIT is not Article
8(3) but Article 8(2),” referring to the competent courts of the host State.*””

In interpreting the text of the Treaty, the Respondent focuses on the reference in Article 8(3) toa
“dispute” and recalls the consistent line of jurisprudence from Mavrommatis Palestine
Concessions* to Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania,**! to recent investment

arbitrations regarding the meaning of the term “dispute” in international law. According to the

 

Respondent, in interpreting Article 8(3), “[t]he appropriate test is not whether Claimants’ claims

 

involve the amount of compensation, but whether the dispute between the parties involves the
amount of compensation.”*? Because the Claimants have sought restitution of the Tumurtei
licence and have not pled monetary compensation, the Respondent submits that the “Claimants

do not—and, indeed, cannot—assert that the parties are in a dispute involving the amount of

with the depth of reasoning in these awards and the reliance on the words “‘involving’ or

For the Respondent, the Claimants’ “expansive” interpretation would deprive the restrictive
language of Article 8(3) of meaning.” The Respondent argues, however, that this would not be
the case with a more restrictive reading. In particular, the Respondent emphasizes that Article 4
of the Treaty, concerning expropriation, refers to the “proclamation” of an expropriation.
According to the Respondent, “[a]s a matter of Mongolian law, a ‘proclaimed’ expropriation is
an expropriation pursuant to the ‘Law on State and Local Properties’.”“"' Similar provisions exist
in Chinese law, such that “[t]he provision therefore has a precise scope as matter of both
Mongolian and Chinese law.” Article 8 thus does not universally require investors to go first to
the local courts and then to arbitration as “investors whose property has been the subject of an
expropriation declaration or similar legal decree would be able to bring a dispute over the amount

of quantum.”*°

Similarly, the Respondent argues that the fork-in-the-road provisions in Article 8(3) would not
prevent an investor from pursuing liability for an expropriation before the local courts and
quantum before an arbitral tribunal. The Respondent notes the Claimants’ own emphasis on the
importance of identity of parties, cause of action, and object in arguing that Tumurtei Khuder’s
many lawsuits in the Mongolian courts should not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction and submits
that “claims under liability and quantum constitute different disputes.“ In addition, the
Respondent submits that a claimant has an option to bring an administrative claim for declaration
of expropriation.*°° The Respondent considers that the tribunal in Tza Yap Shum failed to consider
established fork-in-the-road jurisprudence and accepted an unqualified and unsupported
presumption that an “investor cannot resort to international arbitration after reliance on domestic
courts,“°°

In the Respondent’s view, “[t]he object and purpose of the Treaty also support a finding against
jurisdiction.”“°’ The Respondent considers the Claimants place excessive weight on the Treaty’s

preamble, but argues in any event that “when the Treaty was signed, sovereignty was an issue of

extreme importance to both Mongolia . . . and China,” a fact that is reflected in the preamble.“

The Respondent also notes that “scholarship on Chinese BITs identifies that their preambles
should not be interpreted to support a one-sided, pro-investor presumption™”?

Stepping beyond the text and context of the Treaty and applying Article 32 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Respondent asserts that three supplementary means of

interpretation support Mongolia’s interpretation of Article 8(3) of the Treaty:

(a) First, early Chinese investment treaty policy and past practice in the conclusion of
investment treaties show an “unwillingness to submit questions of liability to international
arbitration.”“!° The Respondent in particular emphasizes China’s reservation with respect
to the ICSID Convention.*!! Indeed, the Respondent argues, “[I]imited consents to
arbitration were the norm in Chinese BITs at the time the China-Mongolia BIT [was]
concluded” and “[p]rior Chinese treaty practice confirms the intention on the part of the
People’s Republic of China to limit the scope of the jurisdictional undertakings.”*'? This
can be seen even in the academic writings of Claimants’ own counsel, who previously
supported the view that it was typical to restrict the right to arbitration to “the amount of
compensation payable on expropriation (but not the initial question of whether an
expropriation had taken place)” in treaties concluded by the PRC before the end of the
1990s.4!3

 

st

 

(b) Second, more recent Chinese investment practice does entr es of liability to
international arbitration and, as a result, more recent treaties contain language that differs
in significant respects to that in the Treaty.*"*

(c) Finally, the preambular language of the Treaty is less protective of investor interests than

other investment treaties to which the PRC or Mongolia are party.*!°

The Claimants’ Position
The Claimants submit that —

the ordinary meaning of Article 8(3) in the context of the Treaty and in the light of its object
and purpose can only be construed to the effect that the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction
over disputes involving the existence and lawfulness of the expropriation of the Claimants”
investments, as well as the reparation to be granted to the Claimants.*!®

The Claimants rely on four authorities in elucidating the ordinary meaning of Article 8(3):

(a) In EMV y, Czech Republic" the High Court of England and Wales in reviewing the
tribunal’s decision accepted that the jurisdictional reference to “any dispute” “concerning

compensation” extended to determining the existence of an entitlement to compensation‘!

419

(b) In Renta v. Russia,” the tribunal held that the existence of an obligation to pay

compensation was an “evident predicate to any amount being ‘due’” and thus within the

scope of the arbitration clause.*?°

(c) In Sanum Investments Limited v. Laos,”! the tribunal held that the term “to involve” is
inclusive rather than exclusive and, while admitting that other readings are possible,
supported the wider interpretation as more consistent with the other provisions of the

BT.”

(d) Finally, in Tza Yap Shum v. Peru, with a jurisdictional clause functionally identical to
Article 8(3), the tribunal “held that the word ‘involving’ must not be understood as

restricting the tribunal’s jurisdiction to the determination of the amount of compensation.*”+

The Claimants insist that the decisions in Tza Yap Shum, EMV, and Renta are relevant because

the treaty provisions in those cases were either “identical” or similar to Article 8(3) the Treaty

 

and consider that the Respondent struggles to meaningfully distinguish the relevant text./?5 The
Claimants emphasize that although the Sanum Investments award was initially set aside by the
High Court of Singapore, the “Court of Appeal reversed Judicial Commissioner Leow’s earlier
decision and found that the tribunal in the Sanum case had subject-matter jurisdiction over
Sanum’s claims under Article 8(3) of the China-Laos BIT, which is substantially similar to

Article 8(3) of the China-Mongolia BIT.”*”°

The Claimants also submit that this result is supported by the context of Article 8(3) and the

operation of the fork-in-the-road provision in that paragraph. According to the Claimants:

 

(i) if Article 8 were read as suggesting that only local courts are competent to rule over
the existence of expropriation; and

(ii) since establishing the existence of an expropriation must necessarily occur before any
determination of reparation;

(iii) _ it would follow that once the investor had submitted a dispute as to the existence of
an expropriation to the local courts, he would — by operation of the fork-in-the-road
clause — be barred from later submitting the issue of quantification to an arbitral
tribunal.””

 

 

The Claimants also disagree that Article 4(2) provides for an option to circumvent the fork-in-
the-road provision, arguing that there can be no proclamation of expropriation in cases of indirect

expropriation?

The Claimants likewise consider that “Article 8(3) of the Treaty must be read to provide tribunals

 

with the jurisdiction to decide the existence and lawfulness of an expropriation in order for the
interpretation of that provision to remain consistent with the Treaty’s object and purpose of
protecting investment.”*?? According to the Claimants, the Treaty’s object and purpose is “to

foreign ii by providing to foreign investors.”**” The
Claimants disagree with the Respondent that preservation of sovereignty is the object and purpose

of the Treaty.**! The Claimants also note that the protective purpose of investment treaties was

recognised in Czech Republic v. EMV, Renta, Tza Yap Shum and in SGS v. Philippines.** For the
Claimants, such a protective purpose mandates broad international arbitral jurisdiction on the
existence and lawfulness of expropriation, as well as on compensation for expropriation.*3 The
Claimants submit that to adopt a more restrictive interpretation of Article 8(3) of the Treaty
“would lead to an untenable conclusion—namely that the investor could never actually have

access to arbitration,** which would deny foreign investors meaningful protection.*°

The Claimants submit that their interpretation of Article 8(3) is the only effective interpretation.
Thus, the Claimants provide that in the situation where the host State has a right to unilaterally
declare the existence and lawfulness of expropriation, substantive provisions of Article 4(1) of
the BIT are futile.**° Further, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal cannot determine quantum
without looking at liability,’*” because the Tribunal needs “to know specifically what and how the
expropriation or dispossession took place.™*

Finally, the Claimants submit that China’s practice with respect to other treaties is irrelevant. In
the Claimants’ view, “according to Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention, the “subsequent
practice in the application of the treaty’ must be one which ‘establishes the agreement of the
parties regarding its interpretation.” The Claimants also consider that Mongolia has not

presented any evidence on its own policy.

The Claimants acknowledge the existence of a line of arbitral decisions suggesting another view
as to jurisdiction, but argue that “those cases can either be distinguished from the present one or
are, in the Claimants’ submission, wrong as a matter of treaty interpretation, and should therefore

(a) The decision in Berschader v. Russia should not be followed because the tribunal’s

 

reasoning was driven by considerations of the treaty parties’ subsequent practice in other

treaties, contrary to the approach required by the Vienna Convention.”

(b) The decision in RosInvest v. Russia should not be followed because —

the RosInvest tribunal analysed the applicable dispute-resolution clause in the light of
the ordinary meaning of its words but failed to analyse it in the light of its main
purpose of giving effective protection to foreign investors, when such purpose had
precisely led the contracting states to enter into a treaty for the reciprocal protection
of investments. The tribunal also failed to apply the principle of effective
interpretation by preventing the investor from seeking relief in the event of unlawful
expropriation.

(c) Finally, the decision in Austrian Airlines v. Slovakia “is distinguishable from the instant
case as the Austria-Slovakia BIT contained two separate clauses for claims over ‘the
legitimacy of the expropriation’ and for claims over ‘the amount of the compensation and
the conditions of payment’.* Only the latter of these two separate disputes clauses
provided for arbitration. The Claimants submit that the ST-AD decision is very similar to

Austrian Airlines.“

(c) Qualifying Investor / Role of Chinese Government
The Respondent's Position

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds that Beijing Shougang and
China Heilongjiang are not investors because they cannot be classified as “economic entities”
under Article 1(2) of the Treaty.“®

The Respondent submits that the meaning of the term “economic entities” “must be resolved by
reference to both Chinese treaty practice and to international investment jurisprudence,”“” which
it contends would exclude Beijing Shougang and China Heilongjiang.“* According to the

Respondent, “the formulation must be read narrowly.”° Other Chinese treaties include express

Respondent reiterates that Mongolia did not invite Chinese investors, rather it was the PRC that

was interested in the Tumurtei deposit.*!

The Respondent argues that Qinlong, which is not government-owned, similarly did not operate
as an entity having the requisite “separateness” implied in the term “economic entity”.“°? The
Respondent cites the fact that Mr. Li had represented China Heilongjiang in the signing of a
number of agreements relating to the Tumurtei deposit, that the licence was not transferred to
Tumurtei Khuder until approximately three years after Qinlong first signed the joint venture
agreement, and that Mr. Li could not explain the unavailability of a copy of the agreement
transferring Tumurtei Khuder shares from Qinlong to China Heilongjiang.*> The Respondent
also points to a series of “oddities” regarding various agreements between the participants in the
project over time“ and questions whether BLT itself had any actual existence “apart from
wrongful acquisition of interests.” including an initial agreement that accorded BLT a 51 percent
interest in what was projected to be a USD 680 million investment by China Heilongjiang. The
Respondent also cites the fact that Mr. Li himself claimed to have been assigned by the leadership

of the Chinese Ministry of Commerce to resolve issues relating to the exploitation of the

 

deposit.“ Finally, the Respondent cites the general unfamiliarity of the Claimants’ witnesses

with the underlying pleadings in the arbitration.“”

The Respondent also argues that the Claimants failed to provide any evidence they are
shareholders of Tumurtei Khuder or that Tumurtei Khuder ever issued shares or received any
payment for the shares.*** The Respondent points to “odd” contractual arrangements between

BLT and the Claimants, the absence of evidence regarding BLT’s economic activity prior to

obtaining the 939A Licence, and BLT’s lack of a foreign currency bank account prior to August
1996.4

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants dismiss the Respondent's interpretation of Article 1(2)(b) of the Treaty as doing
“violence” to the Treaty’s text.“”° Crucially, the Claimants emphasize, there is no restriction in
the text of the Treaty excluding State-owned enterprises from qualifying as investors.*’! The
Claimants add that all the required consents and approvals required under Mongolian law were

obtained.*””

In the Claimants’ view, the Respondent attempts to draw meaning from the “random selection. . .
of two differently-worded BITs concluded by China with third states,” 4”? The Claimants consider
this “probative of nothing’ and contrary to Article 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties, which requires that “subsequent practice” establish “the agreement of the
parties” regarding the interpretation of a treaty, such that evidence of Chinese practice alone is
insufficient.”

The Claimants similarly discount the Respondent’s attempt to draw meaning from the
circumstances of the adoption of the ICSID Convention. The Claimants both recall that the ICSID
Convention has no application in these proceedings and submit that the Respondent’s
interpretation is, in any event, incorrect.‘ The Claimants rely on the observations of Aaron
Broches, who played a key role in establishing the ICSID, and Professor Christoph Schreuer for
the proposition that a “government-owned corporation should not be disqualified as a ‘national
of another Contracting State’ unless it is acting as an agent for the government or discharging an

essentially governmental function.”*” The Claimants deny that China Heilongjiang and Beijing

(a) Qualifying Investment / Investment Risk in the Claimants? Investment
The Respondent's Position

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds that the Claimants have not

made a qualifying investment, insofar as they have not incurred investment risk.

Relying on Romak v. Uzbekistan3” Pantechniki v. Albania,®® Phoenix Action v. Czech
Republic,*' Fakes v. Turkey,** and Globex v. Ukraine,*** the Respondent argues that investment
risk is inherent to the meaning of the term “investment. On the basis of Romak, the Respondent
defines investment risk as a “situation in which an investor cannot be sure of a return on his
investment, and may not know the amount he will end up spending.

The Respondent further defines investment risk in opposition to “policy risk”: “the former
concerns a likelihood of profitability, and the latter concerns a likelihood of accruing benefit to
the State.”“*° The Respondent considers this dichotomy as “supported by the context and object
and purpose of the Mongolia-China BIT.”*? It points to the Treaty’s preambular reference to
“mutual respect for sovereignty”, which it describes as “a marker of the recognition by China of
the rights to decolonization and self-determination of the Mongolian people.” following an

initially fraught post-colonial relationship between Mongolia and China.*** For the Respondent,

the object and purpose of the Treaty was to promote investment while preserving Mongolia’s

sovereignty.

As “instrumentalities™*? of the Chinese government, the Claimants’ risk is “state policy risk,”
which is not—in the Respondent’s view—an “investment risk” because it is not commercial.”
The Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ sale of unprocessed iron ore below market prices
“comports with . . . directives to place strategic considerations above profitability.’ The
Respondent reasons that China’s investment in Mongolia was “motivated by politics and state
policy” that constituted “interference in the internal affairs” of Mongolia and that, as such, it “is

not an investment capable of protection under the BIT.”#°?

The Respondent also submits that the Claimants did not make any contribution to Mongolia’s
economic development. The Respondent supports this statement by referring to the failure of the
Claimants to follow their representations in the feasibility study; their use of open-pit mining,
which according to the Respondent entails only the extraction of resources; the Claimants’
harmful strategy of high-grade mining; below-market sales of ore; and the failure to pay fees and
493

taxes to Mongolia.*”’ The Respondent adds that the Claimants’ expenses were minimal and “were

only intended to benefit themselves.”4*

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that their investment comprises their shares in Tumurtei Khuder and their

indirect interest in the 939A Licence and that those interests fall within the definition of

 

“investment” in Article 1(1) of the Treaty.°> The Claimants argue that the ordinary meaning of
Article 1(1) is clear, such that recourse to supplementary means of interpretation is not supported

by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.*”°

The Claimants consider the Respondent’s distinction between “state policy risk” and “investment
tisk” to be “completely artificial” and without legal basis.°’ In the Claimants’ view, the
Respondent's reliance on arbitral decisions based on the requirements of the ICSID Convention
is inapposite because the ICSID Convention and its particular provision on investment do not
apply.* According to the Claimants, the only non-ICSID decision advanced by the
Respondent—Romak—is an outlier and distinguishable by its “very different factual predicate,”
involving only a one-off contract for the sale of wheat.*”? The Claimants also submit that the
“Salini Criteria” and the requirement of investment risk identified therein “are not universally
accepted and need to be applied with the utmost care.”*° The Claimants recall the observation in
Biwater v. Tanzania™' that “the five criteria set forth in the Salini case ‘are not fixed or mandatory

as a matter of law.”

In any event, the Claimants consider that they undertook investment risk. According to the
Claimants, “shareholdings in a mining company and concessions over natural resources carry
with them the inherent risk that no return (or no sufficient return) be received on the investment
made.”*°> The Claimants also disagree that open pit mining did not contribute to the economic
development of Mongolia. The Claimants note that they have spent money, paid tax and royalties,

and in any case that the value of investment will be addressed in the next phase of proceedings."

CMS and Sempra decisions as “irrelevant to determining whether an award should be set aside

Mongolia are in keeping with Mongolian law, there is no expropriation but only Mongolia’s

exercise of its police powers to rectify fraud, embezzlement and other wrongdoing.”*'®

In the Respondent’s view, this is the same claim that Tumurtei Khuder “has argued and lost.”
Accordingly, the Respondent argues, the Claimants triggered the “fork-in-the-road” clause, and
“[iJt is irrelevant that the claimant in the Mongolian court action was Tumurtei Khuder and not
Claimants themselves.”*!’ Because the Claimants would not have had standing to challenge the
license revocation in the courts directly, they “elected to press their claims with regard to the
939A license through Tumurtei Khuder.”*'® In the Respondent’s view, “Tumurtei Khuder is
merely a shell for Claimants,” and “Claimants themselves were active in the proceedings as the
‘Chinese investors,’ introducing evidence and advancing arguments that the Mongolian courts
erred in its determinations.”*"

According to the Respondent, the revocation of the 939A License is also res judicata, or-—as
expressed by the Tribunal in RSM v. Grenada®®°—a matter barred from further consideration by
collateral estoppel.**! The Respondent also recalls the attention in Pantechniki v. Albania®? on
the “fundamental basis of claim” and whether “claimed entitlements have the same normative
source.”> Here, the Respondent argues, “the ‘normative source’ in both the Mongolian court
proceedings and the present case is the same—the alleged expropriation of the 939A License.”
and the “Claimants themselves repeatedly relied on the China-Mongolia BIT in the Mongolia
court proceedings as a basis upon which ‘Tumurtei Khuder LLC shall be protected.”

parties; (b) identity of the cause of action; and (c) identity of object (or relief or subject-

matter).”°5

The Claimants consider that there is no identity between the applicant in the proceedings before
the Mongolian administrative courts and the Claimants, because the municipal action was brought
by Tumurtei Khuder, not the Claimants. The Claimants submit that arbitral tribunals have
interpreted the identity of the parties requirement strictly.*?° The Claimants add that in any case

they would not have standing in the Mongolian courts.°””

The Claimants also contest any identity of cause of action because the claim brought before the
Mongolian courts was made on the basis of “Mongolian law provisions dealing with revocation
of a licence, not with expropriation.” The Claimants also reject the broader “fundamental basis”

test set out in Pantechniki and expect that “that test would not be met in the instant case.” *°

The Claimants distinguish RSM v. Grenada on the grounds that it involved “exceptional
circumstances” of abuse of process and parallel arbitrations under the ICSID Convention that
were “substantially the same.”** Instead, they contend that the weight of jurisprudence militates
in favour of allowing a locally-incorporated company to “bring administrative proceedings
osal

without precluding the investor-shareholder from bringing a treaty claim.

Finally, the Claimants note that, unlike Tumurtei Khuder, they are claiming damages as an

alternative relief to restitution. *

alleges that the Claimants provided BLT with the funds to embezzle the 939A Licence and the
Claimants made materially false representations about their intentions and capabilities.** The
Respondent considers that the Claimants come to the Tribunal with “unclean” hands and that
fundamental principles of fairness and equity and ex injuria jus non oritur require the Tribunal to
dismiss the Claimants’ claims.*** For the Respondent, “[e]ven if the BIT would permit such claims

to be brought, the Tribunal should refrain from examining the merits of such a claim.”**°

The Respondent also submits that the Claimants “illegally interfered with Mongolia’s internal
affairs.” The Respondent relies on the decision of the International Court of Justice in Military
and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua®* and argues that the principle of State
sovereignty establishes certain fundamental societal choices as a reserved domain of the State.**?
In the Respondent’s view, “Mongolia’s express choice to develop heavy metallurgical industry in
Darkhan using the iron ore at Tumurtei iron ore deposit in order to take significant steps towards
self-sufficiency following a long quasi-colonial past is part of . . . such [a] systemic choice.”*”
Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ claims are “inadmissible by Claimants’

prior political bad acts.”™*!

The Claimants’ Position

  

The Claimants object to the factual basis for the Respondent’s objections to the admissibility of
their claims™? and submit that Mongolia has “demonstrated no basis on which the doctrine of

“clean hands’ applies.”**?

According to the Claimants, “the three factual assertions on which the Respondent appears to rely
to substantiate its ex iniuria non oritur ius argument . . . are unsupported by evidence.”“*

complaint against unwelcome Chinese participation in its mining sector is . . . unconvincing.”**>

The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s allegation that they unlawfully interfered in

Mongolia’s internal affairs. The Claimants consider Mongolia’s equation of its alleged self-

 

sufficiency policy with the issues raised in the Nicaragua decision to be unavailing. According
to the Claimants, the principle at issue in Nicaragua was limited to intervention by States, not
State-backed economic interests. Moreover, the Claimants submit, “this principle was developed
in the context of state intervention by force and cannot extend to the present case, in which
Mongolia alleges interference in its affairs by way of alleged fraud by corporate entities. Indeed,
the main element of the principle of non-intervention, that of coercion, is wholly lacking in the

present case.”™“6

THE MERITS OF THE CLAIMANTS’ CLAIM OF UNLAWFUL EXPROPRIATION

Article 4 of the Treaty provides in relevant part:

1. Investments made by investors of one Contracting State shall not be nationalized,
expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation (hereinafier referred to as “expropriation”) in the territory of the other
Contracting State, except for the need of social and public interests. The expropriation
shall be carried out on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with legal procedures
and against compensation.

 

2. The compensation mentioned in Paragraph | of this Article shall be equivalent to the
value of the expropriated investments at the time when expropriation is proclaimed,
be convertible and freely transferable. The compensation shall be paid without
unreasonable delay.

1. The Legal Standard under Article 4 of the Treaty
The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, Article 4(1) of the Treaty provides for protection against both direct

and indirect expropriation. In the Claimants’ words:

PCA Case N° 2010-20

Page 105 of 153

 

Article 4(1) of the Treaty endorses the well-accepted principle of customary international law
that expropriation may occur either directly or indirectly. The former will occur through “an
outright taking of property” or measures that affect the legal title to an investor’s property,
while the latter will manifest itself through acts depriving an investor of the use and
enjoyment of its investment without affecting the formal title to the investment: such acts
have “effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation.”*”

 

 

304. With respect to indirect expropriation, the Claimants submit that “[t]he accepted measure for

305.

sa7

determining whether the conduct of a state constitutes an expropriation is the extent of economic

impact on the investment.” The Claimants rely in this respect on —

(a)

(b)

(c)

 

the reasoning in Metalclad v. The United Mexican States that “expropriation . . . includes
... covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of
depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected

economic benefit of property”;***

the reasoning in Tecmed v. The United Mexican States, requiring the tribunal to determine

whether an investor was “radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its

   

investments, as if the rights related thereto—such as the incomes or benefits related to the

[investment}—had ceased to exist”;*“? and

the reasoning in RosInvest v. The Russian Federation that “[a] measure constitutes an
expropriation if it has the effect of a substantial deprivation of property forming all or a

material part of the investment, and if the measure is attributable to Respondent” and that —

the term “measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation”
covers indirect expropriation, but without dispensing with the requirement of a
substantial or total deprivation of (i) the economic value of an investment .. . , (ii)
fundamental ownership rights, or (iii) deprivation of legitimate investment-backed
expectations. . . . the Tribunal should evaluate whether the “net effect” of the measure
(or set of measures) is the same as an outright expropriation, i.e., a substantial or total
deprivation of the economic value of an asset.>°°

 

The Claimants further submit, relying on the same authorities, that “tribunals have also found it

relevant that host state measures violated the legitimate expectations of the investor.”>*!

The Claimants deny, however, that Article 4(2) of the Treaty (concerning compensation) is
relevant, much less central, to the present dispute.*°? According to the Claimants, Article 4(2)
“does not apply to unlawful expropriations, where reparation is governed exclusively by
customary international law.” °°?

The Claimants consider the Respondents focus on Article 4(2) to be misplaced and, in any event,
premature. Nevertheless, the Claimants argue that “[t]he Respondent’s argument that an
expropriation must be ‘proclaimed’ in accordance with the municipal law of the host state in order

for Article 4(2) to be applicable is necessarily wrong,” as this would effectively shield unlawful

 

conduct from review.**4

The Respondent's Position

In light of the jurisdictional restrictions in the Treaty, the Respondent considers the relevant
provision to be Article 4(2), concerning compensation.*** According to the Respondent, however,
the “ordinary meaning of Article 4(2) requires that an expropriation have been ‘proclaimed’ for

compensation to be due.”>*°

Turning to the interpretation of Article 4(1), the Respondent submits that —

Article 4(1), according to its plain meaning, has several elements that must be met for there
to be liability. There must be an investment. The investment must have been made by
investors of one Contracting State. There must have been a measure. This measure must have
had an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.

Alternatively, there must have been a measure equivalent to nationalization or expropriation.
This measure must not have been for the need of social or public interest, carried out on a
y basis, in with legal and against
The Respondent also submits that “findings that an investment was not invested in accordance
with law cannot be expropriations for purposes of Article 4(1).”*°* In the Respondent’s view,

requirement for the protections of the BIT to apply. To the extent that a determination has been

made that an asset was not invested in accordance with law, that asset could not be expropriated

because it is not an investment.”**?

2. The Application of Article 4(1) of the Treaty

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that the Respondent has expropriated their investment in Mongolia in two
ways:

(a) _ first, as a direct expropriation of their indirect interest in the “939A Licence which had been,
granted to BLT and then transferred to Tumurtei Khuder, and which qualifies both as ‘an
interest in the property of Tumurtei Khuder under Article 1(b) of the Treaty and as a

ind

 

“concession to . . . exploit natural resources’ under Article 1(e) of the Treaty”:

(b) second, as an indirect expropriation through devaluation of the Claimants’ direct
“shareholdings in Tumurtei Khuder, which qualify as an investment under Article 1(b) of

the Treaty.”°©°
The Claimants argue that expropriation may take different forms, including:
(a) “the formal taking of property rights (including intangible property rights)”;

(b) “the deprivation, in whole or in substantial part, of the use or value of the investment”; or

(c) “the compulsory cessation of investment activities” >!
The Claimants characterise the revocation of the 939A Licence as a direct, formal taking of

property rights. Relying on Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia, the Claimants assert

“Mongolia’s taking of Tumurtei Khuder’s licence resulted in an expropriation of the Claimants”

investment by virtue of their interest in Tumurtei Khuder.”*°

314. The Claimants also regard the revocation of the 939A Licence as an indirect expropriation in

multiple ways:

The 939A Licence . . . gave it [Tumurtei Khuder] the right to exploit the Tumurtei mine and
sell its production, whether inside or outside Mongolia. This was the sole purpose of
Tumurtei Khuder and indeed its sole activity, and the conditio sine qua non of the Claimants’
investment. Without the 939A Licence, Tumurtei Khuder’s shares, and thus the Claimants’
investments, are now effectively valueless. Moreover, the revocation of the 939A Licence
obviously prevents Tumurtei Khuder from fulfilling its corporate purpose, and leads to the
definitive cessation of the Claimants’ investment activities. The result of either is an indirect
expropriation of those shares.**

315. The Claimants assert that the Respondent’s revocation of the 939A Licence frustrated the

565 namely that “Tumurtei Khuder (and

Claimants’ legitimate expectations for their investment,
BLT before it) held a valid licence to exploit the Tumurtei mine and market its production both
domestically and abroad.”*% The Claimants submit that they invested in Mongolia in reliance
upon those legitimate expectations and that these were confirmed by repeated assurances from

the Government to BLT and Tumurtei Khuder, including the following:

 

granting the original T-30 Licence to BLT under the 1994 Minerals Law and then
confirming that right by re-registering it under the 1997 Minerals Law as the 939A
Licence;

approving the transfer of the 939A Licence from BLT to Tumurtei Khuder;

issuing numerous approvals of land-use rights that affirmed first BLT’s and then
Tumurtei Khuder’s rights under the 939A Licence;

 

the signing by local governments of co-operation agreements with Tumurtei Khuder to
improve local infrastructure and employ local workers;

assisting the Claimants in securing financing from the Export-Import Bank of China
through its statements of support for their investment;

expressing support through the Ministry of Industry and Trade for FIFTA to approve
Tumurtei Khuder as a foreign investment enterprise, which it did five days lat

 

approving the Feasibility Study, EIAs, EPP and 2005-2006 Work Plan prepared over the
life of the 939A Licence, which all clearly explained how BLT, and then Tumurtei
Khuder, were planning to process and sell the iron ore;

 

requiring Tumurtei Khuder to sign a repayment agreement to reimburse state funds
expended on exploration operations in accordance with the 1997 Implementation Law;
and

lifting suspensions imposed on Tumurtei Khuder on the basis of alleged violations of the
1997 Minerals Law, the EIA Law, the Environmental Protection Law and the Law on
Control of Explosives, once Tumurtei Khuder had taken remedial actions.°7

The Claimants consider that these alleged assurances gave rise to legitimate expectations on their

part that were frustrated when the license was revoked.**

The Claimants deny that Mongolia’s actions can be justified as legitimate regulatory acti

 

a matter of law, the Claimants assert that “the so-called ‘police power exception’ is not
absolute.”* Rather, a measure can only fall within the exception if “it is non-discriminatory,
bona fide and undertaken in the public interest.”*’° On the basis of ADC v. Hungary,*"' the
Claimants assert that the burden of demonstrating a public interest lies with the Respondent*””

and that the Respondent had failed to discharge its burden.*”*

In any event, the Claimants consider the revocation of the 939A Licence had no bona fide social
and public purpose.* The Claimants submit that the revocation “was not based upon a finding
of embezzlement,”*” and point to the divergence between the stated grounds of revocation and
the Respondent’s present allegations of corruption. The Claimants note that both the notice of
revocation and the court decision upholding it cited only breaches of: (a) Resolution No. 160,
(b) Article 7 of the Implementation Law, (c) Article 30.1 of the 1997 Minerals Law, (d) Article

The Claimants also deny that Mongolian municipal court decisions are the proper focus of the

Tribunal’s attention. First, the Claimants note that they “do not base their expropriation claim on

 

Tumurtei Khuder’s failed legal challenge.”**° Rather, “Resolution 902 amounts to an unlawful
expropriation in breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty, entitling the Claimants to international-law
remedies. The fact that Tumurtei Khuder sought domestic legal remedies in response to the
revocation does not change the nature of the Claimants’ claim.”**! The Claimants further clarify
that they are not bringing a denial of justice claim; rather they argue that the decision of the court
was wrong in substance and that the Tribunal should consider points of Mongolian law directly.5*2
In the Claimants’ view, the question before the Tribunal is “purely a matter of international
law,”583 While the Tribunal may look to Mongolian Law, including to determine whether the
expropriation was “in compliance with legal procedures,” this “does not mean that it is bound by
the decisions of the Mongolian courts or that it has to defer to their judgment.* In the Claimants’
view, “the revocation was not justified even as a matter of domestic law” (see paragraphs 328-372
below).**> Nevertheless, the Claimants argue, “even if the revocation were capable of being
justified under Mongolian law, this is not a defence to a claim of expropriation under the

Treaty.”"8°

Finally, the Claimants submit that the revocation of the 939A License was an unlawful
expropriation. The Claimants recall that “[t]he Treaty prohibits any form of expropriation that is
not (i) ‘in accordance with legal procedures’, (ii) in “the need of social and public interests’, and
(iii) ‘against compensation’ .”**’ According to the Claimants, Mongolia has failed to meet each of

these elements:

(a) First, the Claimants argue that “Mongolia failed to follow its own legal procedures,” insofar

as it did not provide notice and as the alleged violations, even if true, warranted a fine,

rather than the revocation of the license.** The Claimants submit that the relevant
procedural rules are set out in article 56 of 2006 Minerals law and deny that article 14.1.4
of the Licensing Law applies. The Claimants further argue that even if it does apply, the

required procedure of giving notice for each breach was not followed.

(b) Second, the Claimants submit that Mongolia “bears the burden of demonstrating that its
measures comply with the public-interest requirement of the Treaty.”°°? However, “[t]he
mere fact that the expropriatory measure affected a right over Mongolia’s natural resources
is not enough in and of itself,”**' and “the facts show that giving a licence over the Tumurtei
mine to DMP, a state-owned company, was the primary reason why Mongolia revoked the

939A Licence,"

(c) Third, the Claimants note that “Mongolia has not compensated the Claimants for the
expropriation of their investments.”*°?

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that there was no expropriation and no grounds for the application of

Article 4 of the Treaty, even if the Tribunal were to have jurisdiction to do so.

According to the Respondent, a State may deprive an investor of property in the valid exercise of

its police powers, in which case no expropriation will have occurred. The Respondent recalls the

 

discussion of police powers in Chemtura Corporation v. Canada,** Saluka v. Czech Republic,

Methanex v. U.S.,°°° and Tecmed v. Mexico,” and argues that measures to combat embezzlement

are a direct exercise of police powers “as they are entirely premised upon public safety, security,
morals and general welfare as is generally recognized around the world in international anti-

corruption treaties.”°°*

323. According to the Respondent, the revocation of the 939A Licence “was premised on a finding of

&

oO

theft, embezzlement and fraud by Natsegdorj, Bayartsog[t] and Tuya, who Claimants now admit
to have bankrolled.”*”? Moreover, the Respondent argues, the “Claimants” egregious and repeated

illegal conduct served as the basis for the revocation of the 939A License”:

[T]ime and again [Tumurtei Khuder] violated Mongolian law. It conducted unauthorized
explosions, illegally shipped unprocessed ore to China at far below market prices, refused to
build the iron-reduction plant as promised, and repeatedly breached its environmental impact
assessment, to name a few violations.“!
Against this background, the Respondent argues, the revocation of the 939A Licence responded
to “the need of social and public interests” in Mongolia. In particular, the Respondent considers
that the “Claimants” fraudulent misrepresentations caused harm to Mongolia in the form of loss
of development of the mine and promised royalty and other tax revenues”? and that “Tumurtei
Khuder’s egregious and repeated violations reflect a systemic disregard for the Mongolian
regulatory system at the expense of Mongolian public interest.”®> Accordingly, for the
Respondent, “Mongolia’s actions . . . fell entirely within the legitimate exercise of Mongolia’s
police powers.”°*
The Respondent also submits that, having “challenged the revocation of the 939A license
unsuccessfully in Mongolian courts . . . the Mongolian court decisions must be a qualifying
‘measure’ for purposes of the expropriation provision” for the Claimants to succeed. “The
question of whether the revocation of the 939A Licenses was legitimate,” the Respondent argues,
“is a question of Mongolian law.”®° The Respondent observes that the Claimants have repeatedly
contested the revocation of the license before the Mongolian courts and have repeatedly lost.”

Against this background, the Respondent considers that, “[a]n international tribunal such as this
one . . . does not sit as an appeal body of local law determinations, let alone of factual
determinations made by the local courts,”* and “[t]he principal manner in which a court may
violate an international obligation would be through a denial of justice." However, “because
Claimants do not allege any procedural failure by the Mongolian courts, and certainly none that

meaning of Article 4(1) supports that interpretation: the provision refers to “investments,” not “an
investment or some portion thereof.”

The Respondent argues that the facts of the revocation do not equate to permanent and complete
deprivation of the Claimants’ property. The Respondent points out that the “Claimants have not
alleged to have been deprived of their shareholdings in Tumurtei Khuder.”! The Respondent
also submits that “[t]he bulk of the purported investments made by Claimants, namely Tumurtei
Khuder’s equipment, has not been taken at all. Rather, Claimants continue to use the very
equipment they claim to have lost in this arbitration at other, neighbouring deposits. There is thus

no relevant deprivation of an investment of a sufficient level to constitute an expropriation.”

3. The Lawfulness of the Revocation of the 939A License in Mongolian Law

The Parties’ arguments on the application of Article 4 of the Treaty highlight their divergent views
on the legality of revoking the 939A license as a matter of Mongolian law. The Parties also differ
on the relevance of this consideration. In general terms, the Claimants consider that compliance
with Mongolian law is not determinative of whether the requirements of the Treaty have been
met, but are also convinced that the Government's actions were in violation of Mongolian law. In
contrast, the Respondent considers the repeated occasions on which its actions were upheld by
the Mongolian courts to be dispositive of Mongolian law, and also asserts that a violation of
Mongolian law is a necessary predicate to any possible violation of the Treaty. In the absence of

a violation of law, the nsiders that the ion was justified as an

appropriate regulatory action.

The Parties’ respective views on the various municipal law grounds advanced for the revocation

of the 939A License are set out as follows.

(a) Prior ownership of rights to the Tumurtei deposit pursuant to Resolution No. 160
The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, “Resolution 160 did not grant mining rights over the Tumurtei

deposit.” On the basis of the text of the Resolution, the Claimants submit, “one can see from

the wording of the third paragraph that, although Resolution 160 provided for the establishment
of an open-cast mine at the Tumurtei site, it did not purport to grant any mining rights over the
deposit.” The Resolution is rather a statement of intent. The Claimants also add that, in any

case, DMP did not exist at that time.°

Moreover, in the Claimants’ view:

even if Resolution 160 had purported to grant mining rights over the Tumurtei deposit, there
was no legal basis under Mongolian law for the resolution to have that effect: the 1988
Subsoil Law, which governed the granting of mining licences when Resolution 160 was
passed, did not give the Council of Ministers the power to issue mining licences for iron-ore
deposits. Rather, Article 14 of the 1988 Subsoil Law provided for a special authority in
charge of mining and mineral resources to have exclusive competence to issue a mining
licence over non-commonly distributed minerals such as iron ore.
The Claimants conclude that “Resolution 160, . .. issued by the Council of Ministers, cannot have

granted mining rights under Mongolian law as it then stood.”

In any event, the Claimants note that Darkhan did not re-register any rights that it may have had,
as required by the 1997 Implementation Law,’ and prior to its actions in 2006, “the Mongolian
government repeatedly and voluntarily affirmed that Tumurtei Khuder (and BLT before it) was
the rightful and lawful holder of the 939A Licence,” pointing out that DMP was incorporated only

on the day after Resolution 160.°°

The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, BLT and Tumurtei Khuder acquired the 939A Licence in violation
of Resolution No. 160 of 14 April 1990.

According to the Respondent, the Council of Ministers had authority to grant rights to the deposit
by way of Resolution No. 160, characterising that body as the “highest executive and

admit

 

strative agency of state administration” in Mongolia, authorised “to direct the work of the

ministries, including adopting measures specifically addressing state and personal property

rights.” The Respondent refers to the testimony of Mr. Khurts and clarifies that in the early
1990s Mongolia underwent a transition from planned to market economy, with the result that,
after 1994, the Subsoil Law functioned together with new Minerals Law.®! The Respondent
further clarified that the procedure set in article 14 of the Subsoil Law refers only to obtaining

rights for “mining tenure areas” and not mining rights.’
mid-1990s it was a common practice in Mongolia to grant mining rights through resolutions of

the Council of Ministers in the absence of an authority responsible for issuing licences.

The Respondent notes that Darkhan was established immediately after the passage of Resolution

 

No. 160 and submits that this is evidence of the link between the Ferrous Metallurgy plant
referenced in the resolution and Darkhan.°* The Respondent also refers to the testimony of
Mr. Shagdar and Mr. Ganjuurjav (the directors of Darkhan at the time), contemporaneous
correspondence, and the findings of the Mongolian courts, and submits that “there was no

confusion following Resolution 160 as to who owned and controlled the Tumurtei deposit.”

The Respondent concludes that, “[i]n the absence of any decree or other legal basis by which
Claimants’ [sic] can demonstrate that Darkhan’s legal interest in the Tumurtei deposit was
stripped away, there can only be one conclusion: Darkhan’s interest was not taken away.”
Rather, as Darkhan set out in its letter to the State Prosecutor's Office:

Natsagdorj T. had intentionally failed to file an application for the reregistration of the mining
license through abuse of his authority and position for the purpose of satisfying his private
interests, and as a result the license of our Plant was made invalid and thus he took over
Tumurtei Iron Ore Deposit with the help of his sister Tuya L. and his close friend Ganbat.©7

The Respondent emphasises the standard on which the license was revoked was one of civil

liability,“ and argues that the “Claimants misleadingly seek to project the Mongolian standard

for criminal conduct upon the Tribunal,”

The Respondent further argues that BLT’s conduct is relevant to the Claimants’ claims because:
(a) “the 939A Licence was revoked, inter alia, because it was illegally obtained”? and under
Mongolian law, would be considered stolen, even when validly sold; and (b) “[t]here is a clear
and strong relationship"™! between the Claimants and BLT because, inter alia, BLT is a joint-
venture partner of Tumurtei Khuder and Mr. Bayartsogt is one of two shareholders in BLT and a

manager of Tumurtei Khuder.“?

(b) Failure to repay the Government for exploration costs
Article 7 of the 1997 Implementation Law provides:

In cases where a mineral deposit was discovered, and reserves determined, by exploration
activities paid for from the State budget, the holder of the mining licenses with respect to
such deposit shall pay back to the State the exploration costs previously incurred by the State,
on a straight line basis, over the five (5) year period commencing as of the effective date of
the Minerals Law.

 

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants acknowledge that “Article 7 of the 1997 Implementation Law required that certain

licence-holders reimburse the government for the costs of exploration works previously

 

conducted with state funds on the sites subject to the licence in question.

However, the Claimants note that Tumurtei Khuder entered into a repayment agreement on 5 June
2006 and argue that “it was standard practice in Mongolia for licence holders to repay under
Resolution 234 only once they had received notification to enter into an agreement with the
MRPAM, which would provide the draft agreement to be signed.”* The Claimants also note that
“the formula provided in Resolution 234 calculated exploration costs based on information that

only the state had,” such that “it would therefore have been impossible for Tumurtei Khuder to
calculate its own repayment obligations.”

In any event, the Claimants submit that “[e]ven if Tumurtei Khuder were in breach of its
repayment obligations under Article 7 of the 1997 Implementation Law, revocation of its licence
would not have constituted a proper penalty.”*° Neither the 1997 Minerals Law, nor the 1997
Implementation Law, provides for such a penalty, and the 2006 Minerals Law sets out only a

schedule of fines for late payments.”

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that Tumurtei Khuder failed to remit timely payment for the exploration
of the Tumurtei deposit undertaken by Mongolia between 1990 and 1994. According to the
Respondent, this breached Article 7 of the 1997 Implementation Law™* so egregiously as to merit

revocation of 939A Licence under Article 14.1.4 of the Licensing Law.°?

The Respondent maintains that the Claimants were obliged to remit payment by 1 July 2002, but
only began to pay from June 2006. The Respondent does not consider that the belated
repayment agreement expunged the Claimants’ payment obligations because the “Claimants did
not seek to enter into any such agreement . . . before the deadline” and “made no effort” to request
any necessary information from the Mongolian authorities before 1 July 2002.5! The Respondent
also notes that the repayment agreement did not include any “waiver that Mongolia will forego
remedial measures pursuant to the Minerals Law and Licensing Law”? and that Tumurtei Khuder
was unquestionably aware of the requirement as the Government had written previously to BLT

concerning the Khust Uul deposit.

Ultimately, the Respondent argues, “that Tumurtei Khuder’s failure to remit timely payment

breached the Implementation Law was repeatedly affirmed by the Mongolian Courts,” and

 

‘ignorance is not an excuse for its non-compliance with Mongolian law.”*+

(c) Failure to implement the EIA and Environmental Protection Plan
The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants’ submit that “in 2005 Tumurtei Khuder filed an EPP that provided a detailed plan,
including an itemised monitoring programme, for minimising the environmental impact of its
planned mining activities in accordance with the EIA it had prepared for the site.”°* In the
Claimants’ view, the Government cannot realistically have required Tumurtei Khuder to have
completed the EPP more quickly, and in any event, the Government “approved without

reservation the EPP.”°%°

The Claimants also submit that “[e]ven if Tumurtei Khuder were late in filing its EPP, that would
not have constituted a valid ground for revoking its licence.”*’ The 1997 Minerals Law sets out
a schedule of fines for violations of its environmental provisions, and provides “in the case of a
continuous breach of environmental protection standards, the licence will be suspended for 60
days and the licence-holder given an opportunity to remedy the breach before the mine could be

closed.”** According to the Claimants, Tumurtei Khuder was never provided such notice.*?

The Claimants also submit that there are no provisions in the Environmental Impact Assessment

Law, or anywhere else, that prohibit export of iron ore to China.

The Respondent's Position

impact assessment and environmental protection plan, Claimants violated Article 30 of the 1997

Minerals Law.”! As set out in a 30 August 2006 Letter from the Ministry of Trade and Industry
on which the revocation was based, the violation was that Tumurtei Khuder “failed to implement
and therefore violated Section 1, Article 30 of the Minerals Law,” not the timing of the

Environmental Protection Plan as suggested by the Claimants.°

 

‘ding to the R “in its 2003 Envi Impact Tumurtei Khuder
provided, in considerable detail, that it would beneficiate the ore extracted from the Tumurtei
deposit.” Tumurtei Khuder also “guaranteed that it would take steps that no more than the
‘permissible concentration’ of dangerous pollutants would enter the environment, and that it
would undertake restorative steps to improve the environment and control the impact of its

pollution.”6*

In fact, the Respondent submits that “not only were no environmental restorative steps undertaken
by Tumurtei Khuder, but . .. Tumurtei Khuder had failed to meet the terms of the 2003 EIA by
exporting unbeneficiated iron ore to China without meaningful progress on the beneficiating
plant.” As a result, according to the Respondent, “[t]he Licensing Law . . . expressly permits
revocation of a license for continuous and/or material breach of that license’s requirements—
requirements that include obligations undertaken in the documents submitted in order to receive

said license.”°°°

(d) Conducting explosives activities without required authorizations
The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, Tumurtei Khuder had the necessary license to employ explosives.

According to the Claimants:

(a) “On 26 January 2006, the Minister of Industry and Trade, the highest authority in Mongolia
regarding the granting of blasting licences, issued an order allowing Tumurtei Khuder to

carry out explosives activities for a period of three years.”°*”

(b) “On6 April 2006, some four months after Tumurtei Khuder’s initial application, the SSIA
finally issued a letter of permission (Certificate No 46) allowing Tumurtei Khuder to

conduct explosives works until 31 December 2006."

a

BLAST LLC, which was authorised to perform explosives works, and which would perform them
at the Tumurtei deposit.” Thereafter, the Claimants observe, “[t]he State Inspector responded
on 21 August 2006 in a letter confirming that Tumurtei Khuder had remedied the alleged
violations, thus invalidating the State Inspector's Act that suspended Tumurtei Khuder’s
explosives activities on 5 August 2006.7

In any event, the Claimants argue, “the appropriate penalty for violating Article 15.10(4) of the
Licensing Law is the imposition of a fine, not revocation. Likewise, the appropriate penalty for
violating Article 11 of the Law on Control of Explosives is a fine, not the revocation of the licence,

whether the blasting licence or the mining licence.”*”!

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that “Tumurtei Khuder used explosives without a license, beginning in
672

2005 during which time it shipped extracted iron ore to China.”
The Respondent rejects the argument that Tumurtei Khuder did not begin mining activities until
it received an explosives license in April 2006. Instead, the Respondent relies on the Selenge
Aimag Audit Report of Tumurtei Khuder’s activities and argues that “between January and March
2006, Tumurtei Khuder exported 1,750,000 tons of iron ore.”*”* The Respondent also argues that
“[iJn addition, Claimants were exporting, without documentation, significant amounts of iron ore

to China in 2005."6"*

Moreover, the Respondent submits that —

Tumurtei Khuder never received a license “to do blasting activities” pursuant to Paragraph
15.10.4 of the Licensing Law. Rather, Tumurtei Khuder received an April 6, 2006 Certificate
for Blasting Activity that permitted the use of explosives on the “Tumurtei iron deposit,” but
did not provide Tumurtei Khuder permission to use the explosives.

 

The certificate received by Tumurtei Khuder simply permits a licensed party to conduct
explosives on that particular site.”
Further, the Respondent alleges that by failing to document its drilling and explosions in the
Tumurtei area, Tumurtei Khuder violated Article 12.1 of the Law on Controlling Circulation of

Explosive Materials.‘

And, on the basis of a Mongolian court decision, the Respondent alleges
that Tumurtei Khuder LLC “broke twice into sealed storage containing explosives, which were
sealed by of State inspector and used explosives, violating Article 2.1.5, 12.1.2, 14.1 14.2 and
14.4 of law on Controlling circulation of explosive materials.”°”

Acknowledging that Article 21 of the Explosives Law provides for pecuniary punishment, the
Respondent argues that Article 14.1.4 of the Licensing Law also permits revocation of a licence
“if the terms and requirements of the license have been breached several times or have been

egregiously breached.”°”*

(e) Illegally exporting ore below cost and without authorization
The Claimants’ Position

In the Claimants’ view, “Mongolia’s allegation lacks specificity and does not identify which
provision of the 1998 EIA Law this alleged act supposedly violates.”°”? The Claimants also

consider it to be wrong on the facts, and submit as follows:

(a) “Tumurtei Khuder has always been open and transparent about its intention to export most
of the iron ore it would extract at Tumurtei given the low domestic demand.”®°

(b) According to Article 16(3) of the Minerals Law, exporting ore is lawful. The Claimants
indicated their intention to export iron ore both in the feasibility study and in the working

plan, both of which were approved by Mongolia.®*!

(c) “Mongolia’s assertion that the iron ore Tumurtei Khuder exported to China was
unprocessed is incorrect.”°? The iron ore from Tumurtei was processed by electro-
magnetic separation, as anticipated in all relevant documents, and this fact was noted in the

The Claimants again submit that even if true, such a violation would not warrant the revocation
of the 939A License. The 1998 Environmental Impact Assessment Law provides only for fines
and, according to the Claimants’ no conceivable violation was repeated or egregious within the

meaning of the Licensing Law.**5

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that “Tumurtei Khuder violated the 1997 Minerals Law, inter alia, in its
sale of ore to China at less than 40% of the IMF’s international market price per metric ton.”°*°

According to the Respondent, “Articles 38(1) and 38(2) of the 1997 Minerals Law provide that
the sales value of exported products “extracted from the mining claim . . . shall be the average
monthly prices of the products, or similar products, based on regularly published international
market prices or on recognized [principles of international trade].’”°*’ The Respondent recalls that
“the IMF’s market price per metric ton in January 2006 was $77.35, whereas the Tumurtei
Khuder’s price per metric ton to China was only $30.50.”6* The Respondent also recalls that

“Tumurtei Khuder’s 2003 Environmental Impact Assessment provided in considerable detail, that

it would beneficiate the ore extracted from the Tumurtei deposit,” whereas in fact it exported

significant quantities of unprocessed ore.“

Although export to the PRC may have been mentioned in Tumurtei Khuder’s work plans and
documents, the Respondent emphasizes that the “illegal conduct is not simply the shipment of ore
to China, but its doing so in an undocumented fashion at a cost far below international market
prices and without proper authorization.”®° As for the consequences of this, the Respondent
submits that “the Tribunal should accept that revocation of a license pursuant to Mongolian law

is informed by the Licensing Law” and that “Tumurtei Khuder’s underpriced shipments of ore to

 

China were a valid basis by which to revoke its license, and, by extension, valid under

international law.”

(Other grounds for revocation
The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that it is “impermissible to introduce additional grounds in the Rejoinder
some six years after the revocation.” And in any case, according to the Claimants, the introduction

of new grounds for the revocation of a license is not allowed under Mongolian law.”

The Claimants also clarify:

[a]s to the first ground, as a matter of fact, BLT did not make any representation about its mining
experience and as to the second, (a) BLT’s licence was governed by the 1994 and then 1997 Minerals
Law, not the Subsoil Law, and secondly, (b) as we have seen from the exhibit C-93, the government
had itself rejected such an application on the part of DMP some years before.

The Respondent's Position
The Respondent identifies two further legal bases for the revocation of the 939A Licence:

(a) _ misrepresentation of BLT’s mining experience, in violation of the Licensing Law: and

(b) BLT’s failure to make use of the subsoil licence within three years of it being granted, in
breach of Article 21.2 of the Subsoil Law.

In respect of the first, the Respondent recalls a letter from BLT to the Ministry of Agriculture and
Industry in which BLT asserted that it had started to “build a team of experts for the [mining]
development project.”“® In fact, the Respondent argues “BLT was a livestock company run by
an officer worked [sic] and shopkeeper. The only staff with mining experience were seconded
Darkhan employees. This inexperience was not without consequence; indeed, it explains why
BLT waited nearly five years to begin development.””” According to the Respondent, under the
2006 Minerals Law, “[f]raudulent misrepresentation, as a violation of Mongolian law, is thus a
permissible basis by which to revoke the 939A License.”°*

As to the second, the Respondent points out that “BLT breached the Subsoil Law by waiting over
five years to begin mining activities.” The Respondent recalls the Mongolian Courts holding
that Article 21.2 of the Subsoil Law authorises revocation of a subsoil licence if it has not been
used for three years since its allocation.” In the Respondent’s view, revocation of the 939A
Licence was justified because the “failure to develop the Tumurtei deposit in a timely fashion

caused harm to the Mongolian economy fou

(g) The Provision of Notice
The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that Mongolia did not give due notice of the existence of Tumurtei
Khuder’s alleged breaches under the 2006 Minerals Law or Licensing Law. Instead, the Claimants
argue, “the DGMC proceeded directly to revoke the 939A Licence through Resolution 902,
without giving prior notice to Tumurtei Khuder, thereby depriving it of the opportunity to
establish that the grounds of revocation were unfounded or to remedy the alleged breaches.”

The Claimants submit that, even if report of the Working Group can be regarded as a valid notice,

it was given to the Government and not to the licence holder, as required by Article 56 of the 2006
Minerals Law. And, as confirmed by Mr. Nergui, the Working group only considered grounds
related to mining operations and did not examine the issue of alleged fraud or non-repayment of
state budget.” The Claimants also note that both the report of the Working Group and the letter
of 30 August rely on Article 47 of the 1997 Minerals Law. According to the Claimants, this
legislation was no longer applicable, but in any case the procedure set out there is the same as in

the 2006 Minerals Law. 7°

The Claimants further argue that the criminal investigation into Mr. Bayartsogt and
Mr. Natsagdorj’s conduct “cannot have been an effective communication of notice, given that the

prosecution was unrelated to the revocation.”7°°

The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent considers that the Claimants were given more than sufficient notice of the
grounds for revocation of the 939A Licence. According to the Respondent, the relevant notice

took the form of:

(a) The 24 April 2006 letter from the Specialized Inspection Department of the Selenge aimag
to Tumurtei Khuder, “informing it of the results of a Working Group investigation into
Tumurtei Khuder’s operations” and identifying “no less than nine violations by Tumurtei
Khuder of Mongolian law, including three violations that later informed the revocation of

the 939A Licens:

 

The Respondent submits that the letter is addressed to Mr. Bayartsogt

as the Director of Tumurtei Khuder;”””

(b) The 15 June 2006 letter from the Mongolian State Specialized Inspection Agency to
Tumurtei Khuder, identifying “e/even independent breaches of Mongolian law, several of
which were again invoked as the basis for the revocation of the 939A License”;7*

(c) The 5 August 2006 letter from the State Specialized Inspection Agency to Tumurtei
Khuder, noting that “during [the Agency’s] inspection of the Tumurtei Iron Ore Deposit, it

discovered Tumurtei Khuder to be using ‘explosives, detonators, and blasting items’

without any ‘special permission’”;?°° and

(d) The 14 August 2006 report of the Government Working Group, which “found Tumurtei
Khuder responsible for a number of serious violations” and “whose findings led to the
suspension of Tumurtei Khuder’s operations,””"”

Taken together, the Respondent argues that “Mongolia satisfied the requirements of Article 56(2)

of the Minera

 

s Law in informing Tumurtei Khuder not once but several times of the breadth and
severity of its violations of Mongolian law, and further giving Tumurtei Khuder as many

opportunities to attempt to disprove the results of the investigative findings.””"!

4. Preclusion and Estoppel
The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that the Respondent is estopped from “relying on alleged violations it
repeatedly affirmed did not exist or, alternatively, had been cured.”7!? In particular, the Claimants
assert that “Mongolia’s grants of licences and authorisations and its approvals of legally-required
documents preclude it from claiming now that Tumurtei Khuder was in breach of any laws or
regulations or that Resolution 160 gave DMP [Darkhan] an enforceable right that is now
opposable to Tumurtei Khuder.””"?

The Claimants rely on “a well-established principle of customary international law” ” that “a
state may not benefit from its own inconsistent statements or conduct to the detriment of a party
that relied in good faith on such statements or conduct . . . a state may be precluded from denying

the truth of a statement of fact it previously made.”’'* The Claimants endorse conditions for a

valid claim of preclusion set out in Professor D.W. Bowett’s well-known article on the subject,

namely:
(a) “[t]he meaning of the statement must be clear and unambiguous”;
(b) “the statement or representation must be voluntary, unconditional and authorized”; and

(c)  “[rJeliance in good faith upon the representation of one party by the other party to his
detriment (or to the advantage of the party making the representation).”7!

The Claimants also rely on treatment of preclusion in the Shufeldt Case to support their view. In

that case, the arbitrator found preclusion to be “in keeping with the principles of international

law”? and held that:

the Guatemala Government having recognized the validity of the contract for six years and
received all the benefits to which they were entitled under the contract and allowed Shufeldt
to go on spending money on the concession, is precluded from denying its validity; even if
the approval of the Legislature had not been given to it.”*

  

On this basis, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s attempt to revoke the 939A Licence on

the basis that it had been illegally granted to BLT was “unavailing as a matter of customary

international law.””'? The Claimants further assert that:

On any view, by entering into the Repayment Agreement, Mongolia waived any argument
that Tumurtei Khuder was in breach of its repayment obligations under the 1997
Implementation Law. Mongolia is moreover precluded from arguing the contrary as a matter
of international law, under which an act of any state organ is considered an act of the state
itself. The MRPAM’s repayment agreement with Tumurtei Khuder bound the Mongolian
state, including state organs such as the DGMC. It follows that, to the extent that Mongolia
argues that another state organ such as the DGMC could revoke the 939A Licence for non-
payment despite the Repayment Agreement’s existence, it is precluded from doing so as a
matter of intemational law.72°

 

  

In reply to the objections raised by the Respondent, the Claimants argue that “Mongolia’s

suggestion that the Claimants cannot plead estoppel against Mongolia without an express

 

provision in the Treaty is plainly wrong.””' In the Claimants view, “Estoppel has been

recognised as a general principle of law applicable in the investment-law context” and need not
be specifically set out in the Treaty.”” Moreover, “Mongolia provides no explanation, let alone

evidence,” of its “argument that its acts were not voluntary, i.e. sufficiently clear and

authoritative. Ultimately, the Claimants conclude, with reference to the decision in Desert

Line v. Yemen,”* that —

the Respondent is estopped from arguing, 15 years after the events, and having invited the
Claimants to invest precisely in the Tumurtei deposit, that the 939A Licence was lawfully
revoked because DMP had a pre-existing right.

Led

the Claimants have relied on the Respondent’s assurances and acceptance of their
investments to their detriment, and that it is preposterous for the Respondent to allege that
the 939A Licence was lawfully revoked on the basis of alleged misrepresentations made by
BLT well before the Claimants were invited to invest in the country and in spite of the
Mongolian government's having approved the Claimants” inves

 

 

The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the “Claimants cannot benefit from any kind of preclusion or

estoppel in this case.””°

As an initial matter, the Respondent submits that “an investor cannot plead an estoppel against

the state absent an express provision in the instrument of consent permitting it to do so.”””” In the

 

Respondent’s view, an “investor does not deal with the state as an equal,” and “[t}here is therefore

   

is another state and vis:

 

a fundamentally different quality to a state act vis -vis a private
individual within the regulatory sphere of the host state.””* The Respondent relies on U.S.
Supreme Court jurisprudence excluding the application of estoppel in the regulatory context’?
and submits that in the investment context, estoppel would require a fair and equitable treatment

claim for inconsistent statements to give rise to liability.”°

Moreover, the Respondent argues that even if the Claimants could plead estoppel or preclusion

»731

as a matter of law, “duress or fraud of any material kind will nullify the plea of estoppel.

 

Preclusion is excluded, in the Respondent’s view, because with the embezzlement of the rights to
the Tumurtei deposit, “there could be no ‘reliance in good faith’ by Claimants on any

72 Tn other words, the “Claimants . . . cannot

own fraudulent, criminal acts.””? Relying on World Duty Free v. Kenya,” the Respondent
concludes, “the state simply cannot be estopped from raising corruption when it has found out

about it.”

THE RESPONDENT’S COUNTERCLAIMS

1. Jurisdiction over the Respondent’s Counterclaims
The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Mongolia’s counterclaims.”*° According
to the Claimants, “[c]ounterclaims, like primary claims, must fall within the scope of the parties’
consent to arbitration,” and the Respondent’s counterclaims do not fall within the bounds of
Article 8(3) of the Treaty.”*”

As an initial matter, the Claimants consider that the Respondent’s counterclaims do not fall within
the scope of the Treaty because they arise under Mongolian law. Relying on Paushok v. Mongolia,

the Claimants conclude that the Respondent’s counterclaims,

 

arise out of law and exclusively raise issues of with
... law... All these issues squarely fall within the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction of
Mongolian courts, are matters governed by Mongolian . . . law, and cannot be considered as
constituting an indivisible part of the Claimants’ claims based on the BIT and international
law or as creating a reasonable nexus between the Claimants’ claims and the Counterclaims

justifying their joint consideration by an arbitral tribunal exclusively vested with jurisdiction

under the BIT.
Second, the Claimants assert that the Respondent has not satisfied “the jurisdictional threshold
established by the Saluka tribunal: it has failed to demonstrate that its counterclaims have a “close
connection’ with the primary claim in this dispute, namely the Claimants’ treaty claim for
expropriation.””*”
Third, relying on Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania,” Amco v. Indonesia™! and Saluka v. The Czech
Republic,” the Claimants contend that the Treaty “imposes no substantive obligations on
investors that could form the subject of a counterclaim” and therefore, there is no “legal basis”
for the Respondent’s counterclaims.” The Claimants conclude that the counterclaims amount to
144

“vague factual assertions,”” rather than substantive legal arguments.

Finally, the Claimants submit that, in any case, the counterclaims cannot “succeed if Mongolia’s

own jurisdictional arguments are accepted.”4*

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction generally, but argues that if the Tribunal
were to find in favour of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal would also possesses jurisdiction to hear
Mongolia’s counterclaims.”°

The Respondent considers the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear its counterclaims to be a corollary
of its jurisdiction under Article 8(3) of the Treaty. Adopting the Claimants’ legal standard for

jurisdiction over ims, the R argues that “ must have

aclose connection with the primary claim to which it is a response.””” The Respondent considers
that its counterclaims are “directly connected” to the Claimants’ expropriation claim™* because
“they are based on BLT’s illegal acquisition of the 939A License, which was an express basis for

the license revocation.”"?

Rejecting the Claimants’ objections, the Respondent distinguishes the facts of Saluka v. The
Czech Republic from the present case. The Respondent notes that “the counterclaims in the
present dispute are in direct response to the misconduct that inter alia resulted in the revocation
of the 939A Licence.”” In other words, the claims and counterclaims arise out of the same facts.
By contrast, the Respondent observes, the Saluka tribunal rejected jurisdiction over counterclaims
“because they arose out of a separate agreement which contained its own mandatory arbitration
provision.””*! To support the applicability of Mongolian law in this context, the Respondent also
points to the renvoi to State law in Articles 8(7) and 4(2) of the Treaty.”

The Respondent further relies on Professor Reisman’s dissent in Spyridon Roussalis for the
proposition that rejection of jurisdiction over the counterclaims would produce “an ironic, if not
absurd, outcome” insofar as Mongolia would be directed “to pursue its claims in its own courts
where the very investor who had sought a forum outside the state apparatus is now constrained to
become the defendant.””°> The Respondent also points out that tribunals, including the Saluka

tribunal, have acknowledged that investment treaties confer jurisdiction over counterclaims.”

(a) “BLT’s fraudulent conduct resulted in the procurement of mining rights that had belonged
to Darkhan, thereby delaying the development of a processing plant of which there was

great need in Mongolia”;”*°

(b) “Once BLT had the mining rings, BLT waited more than five years to engage in mining
activity, depriving Mongolia of much needed royalties and violating Mongolia’s subsoil

law in the process”;7°°

international arrangements to procure processed ore”;7*”

The Respondent argues that “the Claimants’ fraudulent misrepresentations caused harm to
Mongolia in the form of loss of development of the mine and promised royalty and other tax

the increased price of iron, considers that that loss is “substantially more.”7*!
The Respondent submits that the high grading method used by Claimants while exploiting the

deposit decreased its value, thereby causing damage to Mongolia.

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s counterclaims should “fail on their merits as their
factual basis is neither accurate nor proved.”"°* The Claimants elaborate:

Mongolia’s counterclaims appear to rest on the damage supposedly caused to it by the
Claimants’ “embezzlement and fraud”, along with “the very real damage [the] Claimants
have done to Mongolia in fraudulently obtaining the licence.” On the allegation of
embezzlement, the “severe economic harm” done to Mongolia can only be imaginary, given
that its own organ withdrew the embezzlement charges. There is not even a prima facie
showing of harm done. As to the issue of fraud in the application for the T-30 Licence, as
emphasised and explained above, Mongolia failed to provide cogent evidence to prove this
serious allegation.”

 

The Claimants emphasize that BLT owns 66 licences, including the one over Khust-Uul, and thus
the application for a licence over the Tumurtei deposit “out of 6,000 other licences available in

Mongolia” cannot be evidence that the Tumurtei licence was acquired improperly. °°

The Claimants also submit that Tribunal “should not take seriously” the review of the prosecutor's
decision to dismiss the allegations for want of evidence, since the document was “conveniently”

produced a week before the hearing, two and a half yea

 

s after the prosecution was dismissed,

and after the limitation period had expired.”

The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, “[i]n accordance with customary international law principles, the
Claimants are entitled to full reparation for the harm caused by Mongolia’s breach of its
international obligations.””’ The Claimants recall that the content of such customary law
principles was set out by the Permanent Court of International Justice in Factory at Chorzow,"*

reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-
establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to
the value which a restitution in kind would bear.”
In the present case, the Claimants argue that restitution of the 939A Licence is not materially
impossible and far from being burdensome to the Respondent, would actually be beneficial to the
Mongolian economy. The Claimants also argue that “since restitution alone will not suffice to
provide full reparation,””” compensation should be awarded for “any losses that are not made

good by restitution.””!

In the alternative, the Claimants submit that they “will, in the second phase of these bifurcated
proceedings, request full compensation for the losses they have suffered as a result of the

expropriation of their investments.””””

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent disputes the Claimants’ claim to restitution on the grounds that “Claimants have
not demonstrated why the appropriate remedy to the alleged failure of Mongolia to adhere to
Article 56(2) of the Minerals Law would be the most extreme option available: to return the

license outright. Claimants extend no support for this proposition, simply taking it for granted.”773

The Respondent also argues that Article 4(2) BIT does not apply to the present dispute because
the text of Article 4(2) requires that the expropriation be “proclaimed” and because Mongolia did
not proclaim the expropriation, the requirements of Article 4(2) to pay compensation do not

apply.”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal has given careful consideration to the Parties’ detailed arguments as regards both
its jurisdiction and the merits of the dispute, as well as the Respondent’s counterclaims, and the
complex factual circumstances that gave rise to the Parties’ dispute. For the completeness of the
record of the proceedings, the Tribunal has elected to preserve a full account of the Parties’ claims
and counterclaims (as recounted above) although, as will be apparent, the Tribunal’s decision
with respect to its jurisdiction prevents it from reaching any decision with respect to the merits of

the Parties’ claims and counterclaims.

In reaching this decision, the Tribunal begins its analysis with the consideration of its jurisdiction,
in respect of which the Respondent has made a number of objections (see paragraphs 231 to 301
above). Although the Tribunal has set out the Respondent’s objections above in the order in which
they were presented, the Tribunal itself approaches the question of its jurisdiction in the manner
it considers appropriate and does so beginning with its jurisdiction ratione personae and the
Respondent’s objection in this respect. Thereafter, the Tribunal will turn to the question of its
jurisdiction ratione materiae and the Respondent’s corresponding objections. In light, however,
of the conclusion ultimately reached by the Tribunal with respect to Article 8(3) of the Treaty and
the scope of Mongolia’s consent to international arbitration (as set out below), the Tribunal finds

it unnecessary to reach a decision regarding the Respondent’s remaining objections.

JURISDICTION RA TIONE PERSONAE

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae on the grounds that the
Claimants do not qualify as investors under Article 1(2) of the Treaty (see paragraphs 269 to 276

above).

The Claimants in these proceedings are three Chinese companies. In order to qualify as protected
investors of China under the Treaty, they must satisfy the three requirements set by its

Article 1(2)(b), namely:
(a) they must be “economic entities”;
(b) _ they must be “established in accordance with the laws” of the PRC; and

(c) _ they must be “domiciled in the territory” of the PRC.”

Treaty, Art. 1(2).

were, at all relevant times, domiciled in the territory of the PRC.

The Parties are in dispute, however, as to the question whether the Claimants can be regarded as

“economic entities.”

    

The Respondent acknowledges that “economic entit[y]” can refer to “private, commercial

entities” or to “entities of any kind engaging in economic activities.”””° However, in its view, the
determination of whether Beijing Shougang and China Heilongjiang are “economic entities”
cannot be resolved by looking at the Treaty alone, and guidance should be found in the Chinese
treaty practice, which includes a few treaties that expressly include public entities as covered
investors, thus implying that public entities would otherwise not be regarded as “economic”

“investor”.”® The Respondent also argues that the activities of Beijing Shougang and China
Heilongjiang are not “economic” in nature’” because they are “not motivated to make a profit in

the sense that an economic entity would ordinarily be thought to be.””*° In addition, according to

 

the Respondent, they do not function with “sufficient independence” from their owner, the

Chinese State,”*' and are in fact “quasi-instrumentalities of the Chinese government”? “under

the direct control of the Chinese government, and [] under express instruction to invest abroad in
order to serve China’s foreign policy goals.””*>

Similarly, Respondent argues that Qinlong, while having corporate form and not being owned by
the Chinese government, did not operate as an entity having the requisite “separateness” implied

of agreements relating to the Tumurtei deposit with “some striking oddities””** and on behalf of

the Government of China.”*°

The Respondent also claims that the Claimants failed to provide any evidence of their

shareholding in Tumurtei Khuder.’*7
The Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent’s submissions on these points.

First, the Tribunal has considered the terminology used at Article 1(2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal
finds that the wording “economic entity”, which characterizes protected legal persons in relation
to both Mongolia and the PRC, is expressed in broad terms and does not distinguish on the basis.
of organizational type, business purpose, ownership, or control. In the Tribunal’s view, therefore,
there is no basis to read into Article 1(2) of the Treaty any restrictions pertaining to an investor's
organization, business purpose, ownership, or control, where none appears to have been intended

by the Treaty’s drafters.

The Tribunal notes in this respect that, under Article 31(4) of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties, a special meaning shall be assigned to a term only “if it is established that the parties
so intended.” There is no indication that the Treaty drafters intended to assign any special meaning
to the term “economic entities”. The notions of “separateness”’** and “independence”? that the
Respondent seeks to ascribe to the terms find no basis in the Treaty (or other evidence submitted

by the Respondent), and the Respondent has not established that the PRC and Mongolia intended

 

to assign a special—and limited ing to the broad i y entities”.

The Respondent's case is not advanced by its exclusive reference to the PRC’s treaty practice. As

a matter of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal does not consider the limited examples cited of the

  

PRC’s unilateral treaty practice to be relevant to establishing the meaning assigned to the term
“economic entities”.”° Under Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the
Tribunal may take into account any subsequent practice in the application of the Treaty which

would have established the agreement of the parties regarding its application. The Respondent,

however, has not adduced evidence of any such agreements that would support its restrictive
interpretation of Article 1(2) of the Treaty. Nor has it provided any support for the notion that the

PRC’s practice, as the Respondent has described it, is shared by or common to Mongolia’s treaty

practice.

The Tribunal concludes that the terms “economic entities” in Article 1(2) of the Treaty refer to

any kind of legal entity engaging in economic or business activities.

In the circumstances of this case, it is clear that all three Claimants are companies which have
engaged in economic activities to any extent necessary to qualify them as “economic entities” for

the purposes of Article 1(2) of the Treaty.

The Tribunal further finds that the fact that the Chinese State directly or indirectly owns Beijing
Shougang and China Heilongjiang has no relevance for the purpose of their qualification as

“economic entities” under Article 1(2) of the Treaty.

Second, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent’s additional argument that Beijing
Shougang and China Heilongjiang acted as “quasi-instrumentalities of the Chinese
government,”””! The Tribunal does not find any evidence in the record to support such a
conclusion, or a conclusion that they acted under the Chinese Government’s “express instruction
to invest abroad in order to serve China’s foreign policy goals.””? Moreover, nothing in the roles
played by Qinlong’s controlling shareholder, Mr. Li, amount to a showing that Qinlong was under

government control or instruction.

Nor is the Tribunal convinced by the Respondent’s argument, advanced during the hearing, that
‘because the “Claimants abandoned the preferred basis of claim in favour of sole reliance on a
provision that is generally understood in Chinese BITs not to permit determination of whether
expropriation has occurred,” it would be “fair to conclude that asserting [fair and equitable
treatment] and [most-favoured nation] arguments would have carried risks for the PRC with
respect to its own treatment of foreign investors. An economic entity acting independent of the
State would have no reason to drop arguments that it plainly believes it had available to it,”73 If
anything, the evolution of the Chinese treaty practice since 1998 shows the PRC’s more recent
desire to expand the level of protection accorded both to foreign investors investing in the PRC

and to Chinese investors investing in other countries. The Tribunal cannot, in this context, second-

guess and read too much into disputing parties’ strategic decisions as to which arguments should
be put forward and which should be abandoned, in order to draw general conclusions on the

meaning that is to be given to treaty terms.

Finally, in the Tribunal’s view, the question whether the Claimants have proved to hold shares of
Tumurtei Khuder or whether Tumurtei Khuder has ever issued shares or received any payment
for the shares, is not relevant for the determination of whether the Claimants qualify as protected

investors under the Treaty.

In any event, the Tribunal notes that, in the certificate of incorporation of Tumurtei Khuder,
Mongolia itself has referred to the Claimants as “investors””” that “invested” in the company.”°°
As explained above, in order to qualify as “investors” under the Treaty, the Claimants must fulfil
the three requirements set out in Article 1(2) of the Treaty.””° The Tribunal is satisfied that all
three Claimants are economic entities established under the laws of the PRC and domiciled, at all
relevant times, in the territory of the PRC. As such, they qualify as protected “investors” for the

purposes of the Treaty.

The Respondent’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae is accordingly

dismissed.

JURISDICTION RA TIONE MATERIAE — WHETHER THE TREATY PROVIDES JURISDICTION TO
DETERMINE LIABILITY FOR ALLEGED EXPROPRIATION

The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the grounds that Mongolia’s consent
to arbitration set out in Article 8(3) of the Treaty does not extend to the subject matter of the

Claimants’ claims (see paragraphs 252 to 268 above).

The Respondent’s objection calls for the Tribunal to determine the scope of its jurisdiction ratione
materiae. In order to accomplish this, the Tribunal must interpret paragraph 3 of Article 8 of the
Treaty, the only provision which provides for the jurisdiction of an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. This

provision reads as follows:

Order No A-470 of the Foreign Investment and Foreign Trade Agency of Mongolia, 16 May 2005 (Exhibit
C-64).

Ifa dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation cannot be settled within
six months after resort to negotiations as specified in paragraph 1 of this Article, it may be
submitted at the request of either party to an ad hoc tribunal. The provisions of this paragraph
shall not apply if the investor concemed has resorted to the procedure specified in [ ]
paragraph 2 of this Article.

 

The provision just quoted cannot be interpreted in isolation. According to the general rule of
interpretation, as codified in Article 31, paragraph | of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to
be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.”

The provision on the jurisdiction of an ad hoc arbitral tribunal forms part of Article 8 which is
devoted to the settlement of disputes between an investor of one Contracting State and the other
Contracting State. Article 8 consists of eight paragraphs. The first three paragraphs”” concern the
ways of settling such investment disputes, either amicably through negotiations (paragraph 1),
through judicial proceedings in the competent court of the Contracting State accepting the
investment (paragraph 2), or through international arbitration (paragraph 3). Paragraphs 4 to 8

concern the procedure for the constitution of an ad hoc arbitral tribunal, the procedural rules, the

 

decision-making, the law to be applied by the tribunal, and costs. These paragraphs (4 to 8) are

of no particular relevance for the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae.

 

   

The Tribunal, in its further analysis, will thus focus its attention on the first three paragraphs of

Article 8. Paragraph | states that
Any dispute between an investor of one Contraction State and the other Contracting State in
connection with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting State shall, as far as

possible, be settled amicably through negotiations between the parties to the dispute.

This provision thus circumscribes the types of disputes which may fall within the scope of the

 

provisions on dispute settlement under Article 8 of the BIT. First, ratione personae, a dispute
must involve either a Chinese investor and Mongolia, or a Mongolian investor and China. Such a
dispute shall, ratione materiae, arise “in connection with an investment”; in other words, it must

be an investment dispute.

What may fall within the category of investment disputes under the Treaty is to be ascertained

having regard to i

 

substantive provisions, in particular, Articles 3 to 5 and Article 9. Article 3

guarantees to investors fair and equitable treatment in respect of their investments, as well as the

 

returns or activities associated therewith. Article 3 also guarantees the protection of such

investments, returns, and activities in the territory of the State accepting the investment. This

treatment and protection shall not be less favourable than that accorded to the investments,

returns, or activities of investors of third States.

According to Article 4, paragraph 1, investments of investors of the other Contracting States shall
not, in principle, be “nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent
to nationalization or expropriation.” These three categories are subsequently referred to in the

Treaty by the term “expropriation.” Expropriation is allowed only “for the need of social and

 

public interest” and “shall be carried out on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with legal
procedures and against compensation.” Paragraph 2 of that Article sets out parameters for the

determination and payment of the compensation.

Article 5 of the Treaty guarantees the investors of one Contracting State the free transfer of their

investments and returns held in the territory of the other Contracting State.

Pursuant to Article 9 of the Treaty, should the treatment of the investments in accordance with
the law and regulations of the State accepting the investment be more favourable than the
treatment provided for in the Treaty, the investors will be entitled to such more favourable

treatment.

This broad category of investment disputes, in which an investor claims that the receiving State
is in breach of one of its obligations under the Treaty, is thus subject to amicable settlement
through negotiations. An attempt to settle amicably is a pre-condition for resort to the other
procedures which may be available under either paragraph 2 (judicial procedures) or paragraph 3

(arbitral procedures) of Article 8.

Both procedures, judicial and arbitral, have in common that they must be preceded by a
“cooling-off” period of six months. Paragraph 2 and paragraph 3 of Article 8 thus each establish
a pre-condition for resort to judicial or arbitral procedures, which will be available only “[i]f the

dispute cannot be settled through negotiations within six months””*.

Here, however, the commonality of the two procedures comes to an end. The jurisdiction of the
courts of the Contracting State which has accepted the investment is much broader. Any
investment dispute between an investor and the Contracting State that is not settled amicably
within six months can be brought before a court. This is because Article 8, paragraph 2, of the

Treaty refers to “the dispute”, which is defined in Article 8, paragraph 1, as “[a]ny dispute

   

Treaty, Art. 8(2). Paragraph 3 specifies the same condition using a slightly different language: “Ifa dispute
involving the amount of compensation for expropriation cannot be settled within six months after resort to
negotiations as specified in paragraph | of this Article.”

between an investor of one Contracting State and the other Contracting State in connection with
an investment in the territory of the other Contracting State . . . .” Such a dispute can concern
either the alleged failure to accord to investments, returns, or activities associated with such
investments fair and equitable treatment or protection, as required by Article 3 of the Treaty, or
the alleged expropriation and conditions under which a State can proceed to expropriation in
accordance with Article 4 of the Treaty. It may pertain to the alleged failure to guarantee to

investors free transfer of their investments and returns, as stipulated in Article 5 of the Treaty, or

 

the alleged failure to provide the more favourable treatment in conformity with Article 9 of the

Treaty,

In the view of the Tribunal, the jurisdiction of domestic courts under Article 8, paragraph 2,

encompasses all disputes that may arise between an investor of one Contracting State and the

 

other Ce State the latter’s 1 with its under the Treaty.
This includes the Contracting State’s obligation not to subject an investment to measures of
expropriation, except for the need of social and public interests and while respecting the
obligations of non-discrimination and paying appropriate compensation without unreasonable

delay.

The jurisdiction of an ad hoc arbitral tribunal under Article 8, paragraph 3 of the Treaty, however,
is, ratione materiae, much narrower and covers only “a dispute involving the amount of
compensation for expropriation.” While it remains for the Tribunal to determine the meaning of
this phrase and thus the precise scope of its jurisdiction, there can be no doubt that disputes
concerning the alleged failure of a State to comply with its obligations under Articles 3, 5, or 9 of
the Treaty fall outside the jurisdiction of an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. The jurisdiction of a
competent court of the Contracting State accepting the investment is exclusive as far as disputes
regarding the performance of obligations under these three articles of the Treaty are concerned.
The investor can submit such disputes only to a court of the Contracting State which has accepted
the investment. It seems that the Claimants have realized this during the arbitral proceedings.
Thus, while in their Request for Arbitration they asked the Tribunal to “find that Mongolia is in
breach of its obligations under the Treaty . . . by having unlawfully expropriated the Claimants”
investment, having failed to accord them fair and equitable treatment and having failed to protect
them” (see paragraph 222 above, emphasis added), later in the Memorial and the Reply the claim
of a failure to provide the fair and equitable treatment, as well as the protection, have been
abandoned as the Claimants request the Tribunal to “declare that the Respondent is in breach of
Article 4 of the Treaty in that it unlawfully expropriated the Claimants’ investments” (see

paragraphs 223 and 224 above).

For disputes involving the amount of compensation for expropriation, neither a court nor an ad
hoc arbitral tribunal is given exclusive jurisdiction. The investor has a choice; he may submit such

a dispute either to a court of the C ing State accepting the i pursuant

 

to Article 8, paragraph 2 of the BIT, or to an ad hoe arbitral tribunal in accordance with
paragraph 3 of Article 8. But once the investor has made its choice by submitting “a dispute
involving the amount of compensation for expropriation” to a court, that choice is final and the
jurisdiction of an ad hoc arbitral tribunal is barred. This legal consequence flows from the last
sentence of paragraph 3 of Article 8 of the BIT which provides that “[t]he provisions of this
paragraph shall not apply if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified in [ ]

paragraph 2 of this Article.”

This brings the Tribunal to the critical issue of the interpretation of the first sentence of
paragraph 3 of Article 8 and, in particular, the phrase “a dispute involving the amount of

compensation for expropriation.”

The Tribunal is of the view that the purpose of the words “involving the amount of compensation
for expropriation” is to qualify a category of disputes which may fall within the jurisdiction of an
ad hoc arbitral tribunal. The purpose of this phrase is thus to restrict the jurisdiction of an ad hoc
arbitral tribunal to encompass only disputes which involve the amount of compensation for
expropriation. While the ordinary meaning of the term “the amount of compensation for
expropriation” does not seem to cause a difficulty, the same is not the case as far as the term
“involving” is concerned. Does the term “involving” restrict the scope of that phrase only to
disputes about the amount of compensation for expropriation and nothing else? Or does it cover
all disputes which may arise in relation to expropriation, provided that the amount of
compensation for expropriation is an element of such disputes? The Tribunal agrees with the view
of the Court of Appeal of the Republic of Singapore in Sanum, which had to interpret an identical
provision in the China-Laos BIT, that “the word ‘involve’ is certainly capable of supporting either
of the Broad or Narrow Interpretations and to cavil over the possible definitions of the word
‘involve’ will not help us interpret Art 8(3)... Rather, the words in Art 8(3) can only be
accurately, and more meaningfully, understood by considering the context of the provision.”””

The Tribunal has already described® the dispute settlement provisions in Article 8 within which
the phrase now under consideration is contained. These provisions are part of the context to be

taken into account when interpreting the phrase “disputes involving the amount of compensation

for expropriation.” Part of that context*”' is also Article 4 of the Treaty which deals with

expropriation. In the view of the Tribunal, the provisions of Article 8, paragraph 3 of the Treaty

must be interpreted in the context both of paragraphs | and 2 of Article 8 and of Article 4.

At this juncture, it is useful to reproduce Article 4, paragraphs 1 and 2°” of the Treaty, which read

as follows:

1. Investments made by investors of one Contracting State shall not be nationalized,
expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) in the territory of the other
Contracting State, except for the need of social and public interests. The expropriation
shall be carried out on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with legal procedures
and against compensation.

2. The compensation mentioned in Paragraph | of this Article shall be equivalent to the
value of the expropriated investments at the time when expropriation is proclaimed,
be convertible and freely transferable. The compensation shall be paid without
unreasonable delay.

 
  

  

As the Tribunal has noted, the terms “involving the amount of compensation for expropriation”
qualify the dispute which may be submitted to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. A dispute involving the
amount of compensation is a dispute as to whether the sum to be paid by the State as a
compensation “is equivalent to the value of the expropriated investments at the time when

expropriation is proclaimed.”*

The Tribunal notes that the phrase used in Article 8, paragraph 3 of the BIT is not “a dispute
involving the compensation for expropriation” but “a dispute involving the amount of
compensation for expropriation” (emphasis added). This, in the Tribunal’s view, links the
provision of Article 8, paragraph 3 with Article 4, paragraph 2 of the BIT.

The payment of compensation for expropriation is a primary obligation imposed by Article 4,

paragraph | of the Treaty which, in its last sentence, provides that “[t]he expropriation shall be

   

carried out on a non-discriminatory basis in accordance with legal procedures and against

compensation” (emphasis added).

The phrase “a dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation” thus describes a
particular category of disputes, namely disputes whether the compensation which is due under

paragraph | of Article 4 of the BIT is “equivalent to the value of the expropriated investments at

Article 31, paragraph 2, of the Vienna Convention confirms that the context for the purpose of interpretation

the time when expropriation is proclaimed,” as prescribed by paragraph 2 of Article 4 of the BIT

 

In the view of the Tribunal the term “involving” is a neutral one. It does not by itself enlarge nor
restrict the category of disputes falling within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction; nothing turns on it. The

critical terms are rather the terms “the amount of compensation for expropriation.”

The Tribunal is aware that some other arbitral tribunals and the Singapore Court of Appeal have
reached a differing interpretation of similar provisions in other bilateral investment treaties. While
many of these decisions have considered investment treaties involving other States that are
materially different from the provisions of the Treaty, some have examined other treaties
concluded by the PRC that are substantially similar.8° These tribunals and the Court of Appeal
have justified their conclusion principally on the grounds of effet utile. They, like the Claimants
in this case, have taken the view that a narrow reading of the relevant treaty provisions would

deprive them of any practical meaning.

With due respect, this Tribunal does not share this concern. In the Tribunal’s view, paragraph 3
of Article 8 will still retain its legal effect. Arbitration before an ad hoc arbitral tribunal would be
available in cases where an expropriation has been formally proclaimed and what is disputed is
the amount to be paid by the State to the investor for its expropriated investment. In other words,
arbitration will be available where the dispute is indeed limited to the amount of compensation
for a proclaimed expropriation, the occurrence of which is not contested. While it may be the case
that formally proclaimed expropriations are a less common event than measures having an effect
equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (which are also prohibited by Article 4 of the
Treaty), the Tribunal cannot see that an arbitration provision that would nevertheless encompass

an entire category of disputes can fairly be said to be lacking effet utile.

Arbitration before an ad hoc arbitral tribunal would be available in the case of both direct and
indirect expropriation; in the latter case, if an investor were to seek a proclamation from the courts
(or from any appropriate administrative body) that an expropriation had occurred, or were to seek
through judicial proceedings to protect its investment against measures having (in its view) an
effect equivalent to expropriation, while reserving the issue of compensation for an out-of-court
procedure. The Tribunal does not see that the fork-in-the-road provisions of Article 8,

paragraph 3, would deprive an ad hoc arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction where an investor, in the

See, e.g., Tza Yap Shum v. The Republic of Peru (\CSID Case No ARB/O7/6) Decision on Jurisdiction and
Competence, 19 June 2009 (Authority CLA-32); Sanum Investments Limited v. The Government of the
Lao People’s Democratic Republic, [2016] SGCA 57 (Authority CLA-153).

course of prior judicial proceedings, had expressly sought to reserve the question of compensation

for a decision in arbitration.

450. The Tribunal is thus not of the view that an investor will be left without a meaningful opportunity

451.

to make use of the Treaty’s provisions for arbitration before an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. Nor does
the Tribunal see that an investor would be left without legal recourse for the protection of its
investment in circumstances beyond the scope of the agreement to arbitrate in Article 8,
paragraph 3. As emphasized above, the primary methods envisaged in the Treaty for the
resolution of disputes are amicable settlement through negotiation and judicial proceedings in the
courts of the Contracting State that accepted the investment, which are accorded general (broad,
unrestricted) jurisdiction over any investment dispute (“any dispute between an investor of one
Contracting State and the other Contracting State in connection with an investment”) pursuant to
the Treaty. The Tribunal does not see grounds, in particular in the context of a treaty in which
arbitration was framed as an exception, for considering arbitration to be preferable to these
methods. Nor can the Tribunal see that the absence of broader arbitration provisions leaves

investors without legal recourse.

The Tribunal is similarly not convinced that taking into account the object and purpose of the
Treaty in the course of interpretation would allow it to reach a different conclusion. The Tribunal
notes that the Preamble, where usually the object and purpose of a treaty is set out, consists in this
Treaty of just one single paragraph. Therein the two Contracting States express their desire “to
encourage, protect and create favourable conditions for investment by investors of one
Contracting State in the territory of the other Contracting State based on the principle of mutual
respect for sovereignty, equality and mutual benefit and for the purpose of the development of
economic cooperation and friendly relations between both States.” Nothing in the Preamble

suggests that the two Contracting States intended to confer upon an arbitral tribunal to be

 

constituted under Article 8 a broad juri: ing in connection with a claimed
expropriation. If such had been their intention, they could have simply referred, in Article 8,
paragraph 3, either to a dispute relating to Article 4 of the Treaty or a dispute concerning
expropriation. Such formulations would have provided a tribunal with jurisdiction over any issue
concerning an alleged expropriation, including the amount of compensation for expropriation.
Under international law, as the International Court of Justice stated, “[w]here jurisdiction exists
over a dispute on a particular matter, no separate basis for jurisdiction is required by the Court to

consider the remedies a party has requested for the breach of the obligation.”*°> However, the

Contracting States of the Treaty have carefully worded the text of Article 8, paragraph 3, as
relating to “a dispute involving the amount of compensation for expropriation.” Only this narrow
issue falls within the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal while all disputes, including those
involving the amount of compensation for expropriation, can be submitted to the competent court
of the Contracting State accepting the investment. This is what the two States, Mongolia and
China, agreed on in 1991 when they signed the Treaty. This arrangement should not be surprising
as both States then had similar political and economic systems and did not have any reason to
question the judicial system of the other Treaty Party and consequently to favour international

arbitration for the settlement of investment disputes.

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that it lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae with respect to the
Claimants’ claim that “the Respondent is in breach of Article 4 of the Treaty in that in unlawfully

expropriated the Claimants’ investments,”

Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal need not deal with the remaining objections to

jurisdiction advanced by the Respondent.

For the same reasons, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in relation to the Respondent’s

counterclaims.

COSTS

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s request on 18 September 2015, the final day of the hearing, each Party

provided the Tribunal with submissions concerning the costs it had incurred in these proceedings.

The Claimants’ Position

In their costs submission, the Claimants request “a full award of their related costs and fees, in

accordance with the Factory at Chorzéw principle of full compensation.”*°°

According to the Claimants, the Tribunal has the power to order costs pursuant to Article 8(5) of
the Treaty, which provides that the Tribunal “shall determine its own procedure” and may “take
as guidance” the rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(“ICSID”). The Claimants take note of the Tribunal’s instructions, in its Procedural Order No. 1,

for the Parties to bring to the Tribunal’s attention “such guidance from the ICSID Rules, the

UNCITRAL Rules, or other authorities they deem appropriate.” The Claimants observe that both
the ICSID and UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules grant the Tribunal discretion in the award of costs.

Drawing on precedents under the ICSID and UNCITRAL Rules, the Claimants argue that these
provisions “afford the Tribunal broad discretion in deciding how to allocate the costs of the
arbitration.”*”’ The Claimants submit, however, that the Tribunal should consider both “the extent
to which each party has prevailed on its arguments” and “the conduct of each party in the
arbitration,” in particular “whether either party has ‘needlessly prolonged’ or ‘obstructed’ the

proceedings.”*"*

The Claimants submit that the costs should follow the event if the Tribunal determines that the
Claimants will prevail on jurisdiction and the merits.*°? The Claimants also submit that tribunals
are generally more likely to award costs “against a party that has needlessly prolonged and
obstructed arbitral proceedings, for example by raising unmeritorious preliminary objections to

jurisdiction or admissibility or by making overly burdensome document requests.”*"°

In the event that the Claimants are not awarded full costs, they nevertheless request that they be

awarded their costs in relation to the postponement of the hearing at the Respondent’s request.*!!

The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that “Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, as well as general

arbitral practice, provide the Tribunal with the authority to determine allowable costs, and the

 

discretion to apportion such costs as between the Parties.”*!

The Respondent requests the Tribunal to award it its costs on the grounds that the Claimants have
“failed to substantiate any investments allegedly made” and that the Respondent has established
that the 939A Licence was “acquired by misrepresentation” *'? The Respondent further submits

that the Claimants have exacerbated the costs of the proceedings, through their delay in

commencing the arbitration, through their delay in reconstituting the Tribunal following the

resignation of the initial presiding arbitrator, and by taking extreme positions.5'*

The Tribunal’s Considerations

The Tribunal notes that both sides have requested the award of their costs in these proceedings
and have made submissions in respect of their costs incurred. Both sides have submitted that the

Tribunal possesses the authority to award costs.

The Tribunal notes, however, that Article 8, paragraph 8 of the Treaty provides as follows:

Each party to the dispute shall bear the cost of its appointed member of the tribunal and of its
representation in the proceedings. The cost of the appointed Chairman and the remaining
costs shall be borne in equal parts by the parties to the dispute.

 

Neither side has given consideration to this provision of the Treaty in the course of its costs

submi

 

ions, but the Tribunal considers the Article to be binding upon it, notwithstanding the

Treaty’s recognition of the Tribunal’s power to determine its own procedure.

Accordingly, each side shall bear the costs of its own legal representation in these proceedings
and the Tribunal will apportion the costs of the arbitration in accordance with paragraph 8 of
Article 8. In so doing, the Tribunal wishes to record that at no point in these proceedings has any
member of the Tribunal considered him or herself to be anything less than fully independent and

impartial with respect to the side to have made the appointment.

With respect to fixing the costs of the arbitration, the Parties have deposited with the PCA a total
of US$1,030,000.00 (US$5 15,000.00 by the Claimants, US$515,000.00 by the Respondent) as an

advance against the costs of arbitration in these proceedings.

The fees and expenses of Dr. Yas Banifatemi, the arbitrator appointed by the Claimants, amount
respectively to US$216,440.00 and US$10,441.09. These amounts will be deducted from the
Claimants’ portion of the deposit held by the PCA.

The fees and expenses of Mr. Mark Clodfelter, the arbitrator appointed by the Respondent,
amount respectively to US$300,270.00 and US$21,206.44. These amounts will be deducted from
the Respondent’s portion of the deposit held by the PCA.

‘The fees and expenses of Mr. Donald Donovan, the Presiding Arbitrator until his resignation on

6 February 2013 amount respectively to US$42,700.00 and US$742.78.

The fees of Judge Peter Tomka, the Presiding Arbitrator from 26 January 2014, amount to
US$199,150.00.

Pursuant to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 1, the International Bureau of the PCA was
designated to administer this arbitration. The PCA’s fees for registry services amount to
US$120,044.48.

Also pursuant to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 1, a tribunal secretary from the law firm of
Debevoise & Plimpton LLP was appointed during the period in which Mr. Donovan served as
Presiding Arbitrator. The fees of the tribunal secretary during this period amount to

US$17,600.00.

Other tribunal costs in this arbitration, including court reporters, interpreters, hearing room
equipment, bank charges, and all other expenses relating to the arbitration proceedings amount to

US$97,544.99.

Based on the above figures, the fees of the appointed Chairmen, the fees of the PCA and tribunal
secretary, and the remaining costs total US$477,782.25, which shall be deducted from the deposit
in equal shares (US$238,891.13 for each side).

The unexpended balance of US$49,227.79 in the Claimants’ portion of the deposit held by the
PCA will be returned to the Claimants. The Respondent is requested to supplement its portion of
the deposit held by the PCA with a payment to the PCA of US$45,367.57 within 30 days of the
