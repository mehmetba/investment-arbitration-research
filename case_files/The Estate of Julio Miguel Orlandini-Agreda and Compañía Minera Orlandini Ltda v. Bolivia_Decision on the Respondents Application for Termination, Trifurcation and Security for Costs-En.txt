PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

By Notice of Arbitration dated January 31, 2018 (the “Notice of Arbitration”), Julio Miguel
Orlandini-Agreda (“Mr. Orlandini”) and Compafifa Minera Orlandini Ltda. (“CMO”)
commenced arbitration proceedings against the Respondent pursuant to Article IX of the Treaty
between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of
Bolivia concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, entered into

force on June 6, 2001 (the “Treaty”).

On January 17, 2019, counsel for the Claimants informed the Tribunal that Mr. Orlandini had
passed away on January 1, 2019.

The Tribunal held a first procedural meeting on January 29, 2019 (the “First Procedural
Meeting”), following which the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | dated February 4, 2019.
Procedural Order No. 1, among other things, fixed a procedural calendar leading to a Decision on
Bifurcation. In its cover letter circulating Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal made the following

observation regarding the procedural calendar:

In light of the passing of Mr. Orlandini, the Tribunal has resolved not to invite any
submissions from the Parties until the personal representative of Mr. Orlandi i
formally appointed. Accordingly, the Procedural Calendar set forth in Annex 1
the Claimants to (i) promptly inform the Tribunal and the Respondent of the appointment of
a personal representative of Mr. Orlandini’s estate; (ii) provide a power of attorney evidencing
the authority of counsel for the Second Claimant to also represent the First Claimant in this
arbitration; and (iii) provide a declaration from the appointed personal representative ratifying
all submissions made by the Second Claimant in these proceedings prior to such appointment.

 

Procedural Order No. 1 included two other provisions that are relevant to this Decision. First,

Section 11 (Third Party Funding) of Procedural Order No. | reads:

11.1 The Parties shall submit a written notice disclosing the use of third party funding to
cover the costs of this arbitration and the identity of the third party funder. Such notice shall
be sent to the Tribunal once the third party funding agreement has been signed.

11.2 Each Party bears the ongoing duty to disclose any change in the information addressed
in Section 11.1 occurred after the initial disclosure, including termination or withdrawal of
the funding agreement.

In turn, Section 14 (Issuance of Procedural Order No. 1) of Procedural Order No. | provides:

14.1 This Procedural Order No. 1 is issued subject to the legal representative of
Mr. Orlandini’s estate ratifying the actions taken so far in this arbitration by the Second
Claimant.

 

PCA 276769

Page 4 of 49

14.2 The Second Claimant shall bear any costs of arbitration, as defined in Article 40 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, that may arise from the legal representative of Mr. Orlandini’s estate not
ratifying the actions taken by the Second Claimant in this arbitration.

14.3. The dispositions in this Procedural Order are without prejudice to the rights of
Respondent to challenge the representation or the standing of either Claimant or to raise any
other objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

6. On March 6, 2019, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Notice of Arbitration

(the “Response”).

7. On March 8, 2019, following consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order

No. 3 (Procedural Calendar), which reads, in relevant part, as follows:

4. Having carefully considered the Parties’ proposed calendar scenarios, the Tribunal has
determined that the Procedural Calendar shall be as set out in Annex | to this order.

5. The schedule for the phase of the proceedings following the Decision on Bifurcation
shall be fixed in accordance with Scenario | or 2 of Annex | to this order, as applicable, after
the issuance of the Decision on Bifurcation.

8. By letter dated March 25, 2019, counsel for the Claimants (i) informed the Tribunal that
Mrs. Francees Rosario de la Via de Orlandini (“Mrs. Orlandini’”’), who is Mr. Orlandini’s widow,
had been formally appointed to serve as personal representative of Mr. Orlandini’s estate;
(ii) submitted a copy of an order issued on March 21, 2019 by the Probate Division of the Circuit
Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County (the “Miami-Dade Court”)
ordering that “FRANCEES ORLANDINI [be] appointed personal representative(s) of the [estate
of Mr. Orlandini]” (the “Miami-Dade Court Order”);! (iii) submitted a copy of a power of
attorney dated March 22, 2019, granted by Mrs. Orlandini to Mr. David M. Orta of Quinn
Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP, Mr. Bernardo A. Wayar Caballero of Wayar & Von Borries
Abogados S.C. and any lawyer working with them; and (iv) submitted a declaration dated March
22, 2019 and signed by Mrs. Orlandini stating that “[i]n my capacity as the Personal
Representative of the Estate of Julio Miguel Orlandini-Agreda, I hereby ratify and approve all
actions taken thus far in this arbitration by Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP and by the

Ltda.”? This letter included the following request for relief:

In light of the foregoing, Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal declare that:

@ the undersigned counsel are duly authorized to represent the Estate of Julio Miguel
Orlandini-Agreda, the First Claimant, in this arbitral proceeding for all consequent
purposes;

(ii) Section 14.2 of Procedural Order No. | is now moot; and

(iii) the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation of the Proceedings is due by April 24,
2019, should the Respondent wish to file one.

By letter dated April 1, 2019, the Tribunal fixed a schedule for submissions on the Respondent’ s
Request for Bifurcation, and confirmed that it would decide the Claimants’ requests, as set out in

their letter of March 25, 2019, no later than in its Decision on Bifurcation.

On April 24, 2019, the Respondent submitted its Solicitud de Terminacion, Trifurcacién y Cautio

Judicatum Solvi (the “Respondent’s Triple Application’).

By letter dated April 27, 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to respond to all matters
addressed in the Respondent’s Triple Application within the deadline set forth in Procedural Order

No. 3 for the filing of the Response to the Request for Bifurcation of the Proceedings.

By letter dated May 23, 2019, the Claimants alleged “that the Respondent, through the Bolivian
National Service of Pension Funds (“SENASIR” for its acronym in Spanish), has taken serious
and harmful retaliatory actions against the Claimants in Bolivia as a reprisal for having filed this

arbitration.”

On May 24, 2019, the Claimants submitted their Opposition to the Application for Ter

 

Trifurcation and Security for Costs (the “Claimants’ Opposition”).

By letter dated June 7, 2019, the Respondent provided a response to the Claimants’ letter of May
23, 2019.

By letter dated June 14, 2019, the Claimants responded to the Respondent’s letter of June 7, 2019.

BACKGROUND OF THE DIS

 

UTE

The Claimants’ claims relate to two mining concessions over the Antequera River in Bolivia
known as Veneros San Juan and Pretoria (the “Antequera River Concessions”) and 46 other
concessions in an area known as Mina Totoral (the “Mina Totoral Concessions”, and, together

with the Antequera River Concessions, the ““Concessions”).*

According to the Claimants, the dispute concerns the purported expropriation of the Concessions
and other related properties in Bolivia through the concerted actions of the Bolivian administrative
mining authority (Superintendente Departamental de Minas);> the Bolivian mining agency and
registry (Servicio Nacional de Geologia y Técnico de Minas);° the Bolivian Judiciary (in
particular, the Judiciary’s actions in connection with labor proceedings against CMO referred to
as the “Martinez Case”),’ the State-owned Mining Company of Bolivia (Corporacién Minera
de Bolivia, “COMIBOL”)’ and certain private entities and individuals.? The Claimants allege
that the actions undertaken by the Respondent’s instrumentalities purported to deprive CMO of
its Concessions and other related property in Bolivia to favor COMIBOL and its corporate joint-
venture partners, in breach of the Claimants’ rights under Bolivian law, the Treaty and

international law.'°

The Respondent argues that (i) the Claimants have failed to establish the scope of their mining
rights over the Antequera River Concessions and to prove that works were actually carried out in
that area;'! (ii) the Claimants have no right to request that the Tribunal review the decisions of the
Bolivian courts in the Martinez Case;'? and (iii) none of the State measures underlying the

Claimants’ claims constitute a breach of the Treaty, international law or Bolivian law."

THE RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR TERMINATION, SUSPENSION AND
TRIFURCATION

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent has advanced four objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, relevantly
summarized below (A).'4 Flowing from the first of these jurisdictional objections, the Respondent
requests that the Tribunal order the termination of these proceedings or, in the alternative, their
suspension (B).'° If the Tribunal decides for the proceedings to continue, the Respondent requests

that the proceedings be trifurcated (C).!°

A. — The Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objections

The Respondent first objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction rationae personae (a). Second, the
Respondent argues that the Claimants have failed to prove that they possess a “covered
investment” in the Antequera River Concessions as per Article I(e) of the Treaty (b). Third, the
Respondent submits that the Claimants have failed to prove that they have made an investment in
the Concessions (¢). Fourth and lastly, the Respondent claims that its conduct in the Martinez

Case does not constitute a prima facie violation of the Treaty for denial of justice (d).
a) Rationae Personae Objection

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction rationae personae on the basis that
Mr. Orlandini, his successors and CMO do not hold US nationality under the terms of the Treaty,
and, as such, they are not entitled to bring a Treaty claim.'’ The Tribunal refers to this objection

as the “Rationae Personae Objection”.

First, the Respondent posits that the Treaty does not extend its protections to dual US-Bolivian

investors.'* According to the Respondent, Article I of the Treaty defines “company”,'? “company

como un nacional boliviano (nunca fue, por lo tanto, un ‘nacional’ de los Estados Unidos en los términos
del Tratado)”.

Respondent’s Triple Application, paras. 21-27.

Treaty Article I(a) provides: “‘company’ means any entity constituted or organized under applicable law,
whether or not for profit, and whether privately or governmentally owned or controlled, and includes a
corporation, trust, partnership, sole proprietorship, branch, joint venture, association, or other organization”
(C-1).

of a Party”,”° “national” of a Party?! and “covered investment” i

in such a way as to require that
Bolivian companies be controlled by a US national in order to constitute an “investment” for the
purposes of the Treaty.?* The Respondent also reads Article IX of the Treaty through the prism of
Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “WCLT”) as restricting the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction to disputes involving “a Party and a national or company of the other
Party”, thus excluding dual nationals.° Finally, the Respondent considers that Treaty Article
IX(4) imports the jurisdictional requirements set forth in Chapter II of the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID
Convention”), and contends that these requirements apply irrespective of the dispute resolution
forum selected by the investor.”° The Respondent recalls that these requirements encompass the
prohibition for investors to bring a claim against their State of nationality (explicitly referring to

dual nationals) set out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.””

Second, the Respondent contends that dual nationals must prove that the nationality on which

they rely when bringing a claim is the dominant one “both at the date of the alleged injury and at

9928

the time of submission of the claim.

Treaty Article I(b) reads: “‘company of a Party’ means a company constituted or organized under the laws
of that Party” (C-1).

Treaty Article I(c) states: “‘national’ of a Party means a natural person who is a national of that Party under
its applicable law” (C-1).

Treaty Article I(e) provides: “covered investment’ means an investment of a national or company of a Party
in the territory of the other Party” (C-1).

Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in
accordance with the choice of the national or company under paragraph 3 (a)(i), (ii), and (iii) or the mutual
agreement of both parties to the dispute under paragraph 3 (a)(iv). This consent and the submission of the
dispute by a national or company under paragraph 3 (a) shall satisfy the requirement of [...] Chapter II of
the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and the Additional Facility Rules for written consent of
the parties to the dispute.” (C-1).

Respondent's Triple Application, para. 27. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention provides, in relevant part,
that: “[t]he jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment,
between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute
consent in writing to submit to the Centre”; where “‘[nJational of another Contracting State’ [...] does not
include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute”
but includes “any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on
that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of
another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention” (RLA-5).

Page 9 of 49

On the basis of the above considerations, the Respondent claims that Mr. Orlandini’s Bolivian
nationality—which the Respondent alleges he has held from his birth”—excludes the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction over Mr. Orlandini’s claims.*° First, as a dual national, Mr. Orlandini would be
precluded from resorting to Treaty Article [X.3! Second, the Respondent refers to several
documents on record showing, in its view, that Mr. Orlandini’s Bolivian nationality was the

dominant one, and thus could not have been considered a US national under the Treaty.*?

In the Respondent’s view, these considerations also exclude the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over
Mr. Orlandini’s estate or his future heirs.** The Respondent first observes that it is still uncertain
who Mr. Orlandini’s future heirs or legatees may be.** The Respondent refers in this regard to
Mr. Orlandini’s Last Will and Testament (the “Testament”), which reads, in relevant part, as

follows:

I give all my Residuary Estate to the then serving trustee of the Julio Miguel Orlandini-Agreda
Trust, created today prior to the execution of this Will (referred to in this Will as "my
Revocable Trust"), as it now exists or may be amended after the execution of this Will, for
administration under its terms. If the gift to that trust is ineffective for any reason, I give all
my Residuary Estate to the trustee of my Revocable Trust upon the same terms and conditions
set forth in that trust as of this date. I incorporate those terms by reference, but only for the
purpose of this contingent gift.**

The Respondent notes that there is no information available concerning “the Julio Miguel
Orlandini-Agreda Trust” (the “JMO Trust”) or its ultimate beneficiaries.*° Mrs. Orlandini could
be the ultimate beneficiary of the JMO Trust, the Respondent notes, but the Claimants have
conceded that she is a Bolivian national.*” The Claimants have also failed to indicate whether
Mr. Orlandini’s claims have been passed on to a specific entity or person.** It is nonetheless

certain, the Respondent avers, that “the Estate must be closed within 12 months” under the terms

of the Miami-Dade Court Order, which might result in a yet unknown entity or individual claiming

title over Mr. Orlandini’s claims.*

Without this information, the Respondent asserts, the Tribunal is impeded from establishing its
own jurisdiction at this stage, for three reasons.“° First, the Tribunal cannot determine whether the
continuous nationality requirement embedded in the Treaty has been fulfilled without first
ascertaining who the beneficiaries and the managers of the JMO Trust are.*! Second, the
Respondent cannot determine whether it will deny the benefits of the Treaty to the beneficiaries
of the JMO Trust under Treaty Article XII until their identity and nationality are determined.”
Third, the Respondent may decide to submit further jurisdictional objections directed at the

assignees of Mr. Orlandini’s claims after his estate is closed.**

Finally, the Respondent submits that CMO has no standing to bring a claim against Bolivia under
the Treaty because CMO is a company controlled by Bolivian nationals, and thus cannot qualify
as a US “company” under Articles I(d), IX(4) and IX(8) of the Treaty.“4 According to the
Respondent, this is again because Article [X(4) imports the jurisdictional requirements set forth
in Chapter II of the ICSID Convention, including the prohibition for nationals of a respondent
State and companies controlled by nationals of that State to bring claims against their State of

nationality.*°

As a result, upholding jurisdiction over CMO’s claims would, in the Respondent’s view, defeat
the object and purpose of the Treaty and the intention of the Treaty Parties.“° The Respondent
refers to certain evidence on record showing, in its view, that CMO was controlled in its entirety

by Mr. Orlandini and Ms. Jeannette Said de Orlandini (Mr. Orlandini’s former partner), who are

ICSID Convention] refers to ‘foreign control’ without specifying any nationality requirements in this
respect. It is clear from the wording and from the context that control exercised by nationals of the host
State is not ‘foreign control’ and that juridical persons controlled by such nationals are excluded from
ICSID’s jurisdiction.” See also supra para. 22.

cooperation between them, with respect to investment by nationals and companies of one Party in the

both Bolivian nationals.” According to the Respondent, this is also consistent with CMO’s

conduct before Bolivian authorities.**

Irrespective of the nationality of the owners of CMO, the Respondent posits that the Claimants
have failed to prove that Mr. Orlandini held control over CMO at all relevant times. The
Respondent considers that the ownership of CMO was, at least, “confusing”, owing to
(i) Mr. Orlandini’s relatives bringing judicial proceedings against him to take over CMO;
(ii) Bolivian authorities taking control over CMO at certain stages;*° and (iii) the recording of

liens on CMO’s shares.*!
b) Covered Investment Objection

The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ claims concerning the Antequera River Concessions
fall outside the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because the Claimants have failed to prove”
that they constitute a “covered investment” under Articles I(e) and [X(1) of the Treaty.*? The

Tribunal refers to this objection as the “Covered Investment Objection”.

The Respondent alleges that CMO’s exploitation rights under the Antequera River Concessions
were limited to the river bed, while the State measures that constituted an alleged expropriation
in this case related only to the underground. As a result, the Respondent claims, no “covered
investments” made by the Claimants could have been affected by the State measures regulating

the use of the underground of the Antequera River.*°

The Respondent explains that the scope of the Antequera River Concessions is defined in a 1906
act that was deliberately not filed with the Notice of Arbitration,*° and rejects the Claimants’
reliance on certain certificates issued by the Servicio Nacional Técnico de Minas (“SETMIN”)
in 2000 because they do not address the nature or scope of the Claimants’ rights under the

Antequera River Concessions.*”
c) Protected Investment Objection

The Respondent further rejects that Mr. Orlandini’s shareholding in CMO or CMO’s mining
concessions and other property constitute investments protected by the Treaty.** The Tribunal

refers to this objection as the “Protected Investment Objection”.

The Respondent argues that the Treaty only protects “investments” that (i) are “covered” in the
sense of Article I(d) and (e) of the Treaty; and (ii) constitute an investment in accordance with
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which is incorporated into the Treaty via Article [X(4).°
Under both of these instruments, the Respondent says, claiming ownership of an asset with
economic value would not suffice to demonstrate the existence of an investment; an “economic
aspect” or a “commitment of resources” must also exist.“ Relying on Orascom v. Argelia and
other ICSID and UNCITRAL investment cases, the Respondent submits that the “economic
dimension” of the concept of investment requires that an investment encompass
“(@) a contribution or allocation of resources, (ii) a duration, and (iii) risk, which includes the
expectation (albeit not necessarily fulfilled) of a commercial return.”°!

Applying the above rationale to the instant case, the Respondent submits that the Claimants have
failed to prove ownership of an investment pursuant to the Treaty and the ICSID Convention;
first, because the issues raised in connection the Rationae Personae Objection preclude the

existence of a “covered investment” owned by a US national;® and second, because the Claimants

have failed to prove that they have made a longstanding economic contribution, borne any risk or

sought to obtain a commercial profit with respect to the Concessions.
d) Denial of Justice Objection

Lastly, the Respondent argues that its course of conduct in the Martinez Case, as characterized by
the Claimants, does not amount to a prima facie violation of the Treaty for denial of justice.“ The

Tribunal refers to this objection as the “Denial of Justice Objection”.

Relying on Judge Higgins’ Separate Opinion in the Oil Platforms case and other decisions in
investment cases, the Respondent contends that the Claimants must prove that the facts underlying
their claims, as alleged, constitute a prima facie violation of the Treaty for the Tribunal to hold

jurisdiction over those claims.

According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ contentions regarding the Martinez Case do not
constitute a prima facie denial of justice because they refer exclusively to certain procedural
decisions of Bolivian courts that have no bearing to international law.® Even if the Claimants’
allegations were proven, the Respondent avers, the actions of Bolivian courts would amount, at

most, to a defective application of Bolivian law, and not to a breach of the Treaty.”

The Respondent argues that Bolivian courts alone are competent to interpret Bolivian procedural
law, while arbitral tribunals should refrain from acting as “appeal organs” for the systematic

revision of domestic court decisions.

B. Request for Termination or Suspension

The Respondent requests, in connection with its Rationae Personae Objection, that these
proceedings be terminated without prejudice as per Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.” The

termination of the proceedings would be justified, in the Respondent’s view, because it is evident

that Mr. Orlandini, his successors and CMO do not fulfill the requirements to bring a Treaty claim

against Bolivia.”

In the alternative, the Respondent opines that suspending the proceedings until the estate of
Mr. Orlandini is closed by the Miami-Dade Court”! would be a “pragmatic solution”,” seeing that
itis still uncertain who Mr. Orlandini’s future heirs or legatees may be and the Tribunal is impeded

from establishing its jurisdiction until their identity is determined.”

C. Request for Trifurcation

The Respondent requests that the proceedings be trifurcated as between jurisdiction, merits and

quantum if the Tribunal decides for the proceedings to continue.”

First, the Respondent refers to considerations of elementary justice and procedural efficiency to
support its trifurcation request.”> Compelling a State to respond on the merits and quantum of
claims over which no tribunal has established its jurisdiction is, in the Respondent’s view,
inherently unjust and contrary to basic principles of international dispute resolution.” This is
because no sovereign State can be presumed to have consented to the jurisdiction of an
international tribunal.”’” The Respondent also refers to instances in which investment tribunals
have opted for bifurcation when addressing jurisdiction as a preliminary question would result in

significant savings of work and costs.”

The Respondent posits that the standard for bifurcation applicable to its jurisdictional objections

is that articulated in Philip Morris Asia v. Australia,” which it claims includes the following three

guiding factors: (i) “ [i]s the objection prima facie serious and substantial?;” (ii) “[c]an the

objection be examined without prejudging or entering the merits?;” and (iii) “[c]ould the

objection, if successful, dispose of all or an essential part of the claims raised?”*”

The Respondent considers that the above standard for bifurcation is clearly met vis-a-vis its

jurisdictional objections:*!

(a)

(b)

(©)

First, the Respondent sees its objections as “‘serious and substantial” because they require
the Tribunal to address fundamental questions of public international law and interpretation
of the Treaty,*? such as the implications of Mr. Orlandini’s dual nationality,** the standing
of a company controlled by Bolivian nationals to bring a claim against Bolivia and the

scope of the Tribunal’s power to scrutinize the actions of domestic Bolivian courts.*°

Second, the Respondent considers that the Tribunal can decide its jurisdictional objections
without entering into analysis of 15 years of proceedings in the Martinez Case,*° the
decisions of the Superintendente de Minas in connection with the Antequera River

Concessions*’ or whether the Respondent's actions constitute an expropriation.**

Third, the Respondent argues that the Rationae Personae Objection, the Protected
Investment Objection and the Denial of Justice Objection would, if upheld, dispose of the
entirety of the dispute; while upholding the Covered Investment Objection would dispose

of all claims raised in connection with the Antequera River Concessions.*°

Lastly, the Respondent contends that both the merits and the quantum phase of the arbitration
would be significantly large and complex, if at all necessary. It therefore claims that trifurcating

the proceedings would simplify the analysis of the dispute.”

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants consider that the Respondent’s request for termination or suspension of the
proceedings is made in bad faith and with dilatory purposes, and request that it be rejected (A)."!
The Claimants also oppose the Respondent’s request that jurisdiction and merits issues be decided

separately, but do not object to the bifurcation of the proceedings with regard to quantum (B).°”

A. Request for Termination or Suspension

The Claimants first argue that the Tribunal has already addressed and rejected the Respondent’s
request for termination or suspension of the proceedings:°? the Tribunal and the Parties discussed
the consequences of Mr. Orlandini’s passing (including the need to terminate or suspend the
proceedings) during the First Procedural Meeting, and the Tribunal later decided that the
proceedings continue in Section 14 of its Procedural Order No. 1.°* The Claimants also consider
that they have “fully complied with all of the Tribunal’s instructions” as set forth in that provision,
which they infer is confirmed by the fact that the proceedings continued and a schedule for

submissions on bifurcation was fixed.°°

The Claimants note that they already identified Mrs. Orlandini as the sole heir of Mr. Orlandini,”®

and contend that the Tribunal has not requested any further clarifications regarding
Mr. Orlandini’s heirs or beneficiaries. As a result, the Claimants request that the Tribunal grant

their outstanding requests, as set out in their letter of March 25, 2019, that the Tribunal confirm

that (i) counsel appointed by Mrs. Orlandini are authorized to represent the First Claimant; and

(ii) Section 14.2 of Procedural Order No. 1 is now moot.®”

The Claimants further reject that continuation of the arbitral proceedings has become
“unnecessary or impossible” as per Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules following the passing
of Mr. Orlandini.*

First, the Claimants consider that all applicable nationality requirements have been satisfied
because Mr. Orlandini was a US national from birth until his passing,” and investment tribunals
have consistently determined that the investor’ s nationality at the time of filing the claim “is what
is germane to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”!° The identities or nationalities of Mr. Orlandini’s
heirs or beneficiaries, according to the Claimants, are completely irrelevant to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction'®' because the Treaty does not contain a continuous nationality requirement.'°? The
Claimants argue that the authorities relied upon by the Respondent to support the existence of this
requirement pertain to the diplomatic protection context, not to investor-State arbitration.'°? Even
in that context, they note, the International Law Commission (the “ILC”) has declined to adopt a

blanket continuous nationality rule.!°*

Second, the Claimants reject that Mr. Orlandini’s heirs could replace his estate for the purpose of

determining the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.'°° According to the Claimants, Mr. Orlandini’s sole heir

 

is Mrs. Orlandini,'® who is duly qualified to prosecute Mr. Orlandini’s claims on behalf of his

estate'”’ and is only participating in the present proceeding in a representative capacity, and not

as a claimant herself. '°* It is therefore “entirely speculative and baseless”, in the Claimants’ view,

whether other heirs or beneficiaries of Mr. Orlandini may appear before the Tribunal. !°

The Claimants further consider the Respondent’s request for further details concerning the JMO
Trust to be “intrusive and unnecessary.”!'® They submit that this information would be irrelevant
for a denial of benefits defense, which in any event would be untimely as the dispute has already
crystalized.'!! The Claimants repeat that, as provided in the Testament and confirmed by the
attorney representing Mrs. Orlandini before the Miami-Dade Court (Ms. Kimberly A. Martinez-
Lejarza), Mrs. Orlandini will be the trustee and sole beneficiary of the JMO Trust, as well as the

recipient of the residuary estate. !!*

The Claimants consider that the Respondent has displayed an “insensitive” conduct and baselessly

113

accused them of not abiding by the Tribunal’s instructions.''* Consequently, they submit that the

Respondent’s “delay tactics” should be punished and that “the Tribunal should assess the costs

incurred by Claimants in responding to the Respondent’s termination and suspension request.” |'+

Lastly, the Claimants refer to Ms. Martinez-Lejarza’s indication that the probate proceeding
before the Miami-Dade Court will remain open until Mr. Orlandini’s claims against Bolivia are
fully resolved.'!> In the Claimants’ view, this makes the Respondent’s request for termination or

suspension “nonsensical” and “impractical.”!!®

B. Request for Trifurcation

The Claimants first address the applicable standard on bifurcation (a) and then explain how, in
their view, the Rationae Personae Objection (b), the Covered Investment Objection (c), the
Protected Investment Objection (d) and the Denial of Justice Objection (e) fail to meet that
standard. Finally, they propose that the proceedings be bifurcated exclusively with respect to

quantum (f).
a) Applicable Standard

The Claimants refer to Articles 17(1) and 23(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules as containing the
applicable standard on bifurcation.''’ The “proper touchstone”, the Claimants opine, is whether
bifurcation would contribute to a “fair and efficient process.”!'®

The Claimants reject the existence of a presumption in favor of bifurcation in Article 23(3) and
the Respondent’s proposition that deciding all issues in a single phase would be unfair and
contrary to international law.'!® Tribunals in investor-state arbitrations often decide large and
complex cases within a single phase, the Claimants note; but, in doing so, they do not “presume”
that a State has consented to arbitration.'”° The Claimants consider the Respondent's reliance on
the practice of the International Court of Justice (the “ICJ”’) to be “misplaced”, since Article 79(5)
of the ICJ Rules of Court provide for automatic bifurcation when preliminary objections are
submitted.'?! Instead, the Claimants rely on the UNCITRAL Rules, which allow a tribunal to rule
on jurisdictional pleas “either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits.” '”? In the
Claimants’ view, this provision embodies an existing practice of gathering of jurisdictional and

merits issues in a single phase, which seeks to enhance efficiency and procedural economy. !”°

The Claimants also refer to the three criteria considered in Glamis Gold v. United States of
America as a standard often applied by tribunals when deciding bifurcation requests,'* and note
that the factors established in Philip Morris v. Australia, on which the Respondent relies, “involve
substantially the same considerations.”!75 The Claimants consider that, under either standard, all
criteria are cumulative;!7° and even when all three requirements are met, the Tribunal may still
“exercise its discretion to hear all issues in a single phase.””!?7

Lastly, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s request for trifurcation should be rejected for
reasons of procedural efficiency and fairness.'?* The Claimants note that the present proceedings
have been pending for more than a year, and argue that dividing the proceeding into three phases
would cause “outrageous delay and expense”, an aspect that is oft-criticized in the arbitral
community. '?° The Claimants finally note that the Respondent has failed to provide any precedent

of a tribunal ordering trifurcation in an investor-State arbitration.

b) Rationae Personae Objection

The Claimants submit that the Rationae Personae Objection is not substantial, raises issues that

are intertwined with the merits and cannot justify bifurcation of the jurisdictional phase.'*!

First, the Claimants repeat their argument that the identity and nationality of Mr. Orlandini’s heirs
is irrelevant to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and consider the Respondent’s allegations in this regard
to be frivolous and insubstantial.'*? The Claimants also highlight that CMO has independent

standing as a Claimant in this arbitration,'*? which would make the Respondent’s jurisdictional

objection regarding Mr. Orlandini’s heirs incapable of disposing the dispute, making bifurcation

unwarranted. '**

Second, the Claimants claim that the Treaty does not exclude dual citizens, such as Mr. Orlandini,
from the scope of protected “nationals”:!*5 Mr. Orlandini holds US nationality and is therefore a
“natural person who is a national of [the US] under its applicable law” in accordance with Article
I(c) of the Treaty.'*° Relying on Serafin Garcia Armas v. Venezuela,'™ the Claimants argue that
reading an exclusion of dual nationals into Treaty Article IX(1) would be tantamount to an
impermissible revision of the text of the Treaty, which would be contrary to Article 31 of the
VCLT"* and would also contradict the Treaty’s object and purpose in “promot[ing] greater

economic cooperation,” “stimulat[ing] the flow of private capital” and establishing a “stable

framework for investment.” %?

The Claimants further reject the Respondent’s attempt to import the exclusion of dual nationals
in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention through Treaty Article [X(4).'4° The Claimants read this
Treaty provision through the prism of Article 31 of the VCLT as simply clarifying that the standing
consent to arbitrate given by the Treaty Parties constitutes a “written consent of the parties” (for
purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention) and an “agreement in writing” (for purposes of
the 1958 New York Convention), which is standard treaty practice."4! This provision, the
Claimants claim, does not “covertly import requirements of the ICSID and New York

Conventions”,'”? and, if it did, it would “deprive claimants’ choice of [the UNCITRAL] arbitral

reliance on the ICSID Convention to be frivolous because Bolivia denounced the ICSID

Convention in 2007.'*

Third, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s proposition that a dominant and effective nationality
test applies. '*° First, the Claimants read the plain text of Article I(c) of the Treaty as requiring that
a natural person be a national under the laws of the pertinent Contracting Party to be considered
a “national” for the purposes of the Treaty.'4° The Claimants highlight that this definition of
“national” differs from comparable definitions in other treaties, which contain an express
reference to the dominant and effective nationality test.'*7 Second, the Claimants consider the
Respondent’s reliance on authorities from the diplomatic protection context to be improper
because they are “are guided by a different logic” than investor-State arbitration.'* This is
because of the Treaty’s standing as lex specialis in these proceedings.'*? The Claimants also
criticize the Respondent’s reliance on Serafin Garcia Armas v. Venezuela, observing that the
tribunal in that case found that the dominant and effective nationality test was irrelevant for the

purpose of determining its jurisdiction rationae personae.'*°

The Claimants further argue that, if a dominant and effective nationality test applied, it would
require “a full examination of Mr. Orlandini’s time in Bolivia and the United States”, raising
issues that are intertwined with the merits.'*! The Claimants refer in this regard to Ballantine v.

Dominican Republic, where the tribunal was required to apply the dominant and effective

152

nationality test as per the governing treaty'*’ and decided not to deal with this matter as a

preliminary question owing to “the factual link between the merits and the objection”.'™ In the
instant case, the Claimants note, bifurcating jurisdiction and merits would require the Tribunal to
examine, on two separate occasions, the same facts regarding the Parties’ conduct in the Martinez
Case and other related proceedings, and could lead to the Tribunal prejudging certain issues going
to the merits if it issued a preliminary ruling that Mr. Orlandini acted only as a Bolivian national

before Bolivian authorities. '**

Fourth, the Claimants contend that CMO is entitled to bring claims in its own right against
Bolivia.'°> This is because CMO was 95% owned and controlled by Mr. Orlandini (a protected
US national). As such, the Claimants claim, CMO qualifies as a “covered investment” under
Treaty Article I(e),'°° and shall be treated as a US company under Article [X(8),'°’ regardless of
how it presented itself before Bolivian authorities.'°* The Claimants also repeat their argument
that the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention do not apply, and

extend this consideration to CMO.'*

The Claimants further submit that the relevant test for establishing CMO’s standing in this
arbitration is whether Mr. Orlandini held ownership or control “immediately before” the allegedly

unlawful actions of the Respondent, and claim that this test is satisfied in the instant case.!°°

Finally, the Claimants argue that there is a “factual link” between the Respondent’s arguments on
the merits and its arguments regarding CMO’s control'®! that tilts the balance against

162

bifurcation.'* The first limb of this “factual link” are the legal proceedings involving

CMO).'* The second limb are the judicial interventions against CMO within the context of the
Martinez Case, which, according to the Claimants, could not have affected Mr. Orlandini’s
control, since the role of the intervenor was only to oversee the management of the company. '*
Finally, the Claimants refer to the liens allegedly recorded on the shares of CMO, which would

have had to be executed to affect the ownership of CMO.'®
c) Covered Investment Objection

The Claimants consider that the Covered Investment Objection is not substantial, is directly

intertwined with the merits and would not, even if upheld, dispose of the entirety of the dispute. '°°

According to the Claimants, the measures adopted by the Respondent’s authorities denying their
ownership of their mining rights, including in the Antequera River, concern “some of the central

treaty breaches in this dispute.”'®”

In arguing that CMO did not have underground mining rights
to Veneros San Juan, the Claimants claim, “Bolivia is in essence arguing that it did not commit
an expropriation”, which is an argument going to the merits.'°* In the Claimants’ view, dealing
with these issues in two phases would entail the repetition of witness and expert evidence on the

same matters, as well as a risk of prejudging the merits while deciding on jurisdiction.'®

As to the substance of the Covered Investment Objection, the Claimants consider that the
SETMIN certificates are sufficient to prove the nature and scope of their rights in the Concessions,
since they are directly referenced in the documents in the form of ‘pertenencias’ .'” In denying
the Claimants’ underground mining rights under the Antequera River Concessions, the Claimants

claim, the Respondent has conceded that an expropriation occurred.!7!

Finally, the Claimants note that their expropriation claim also encompasses their surface mining
rights, and therefore the Covered Investment Objection could not, even if upheld, dispose of the

dispute. !7”
d) Protected Investment Objection

The Claimants also consider the Protected Investment Objection to be insubstantial and

intertwined with the merits, and thus incapable of justifying bifurcation.'”*

The Claimants submit that the Concessions and their shares in CMO “amply fall” within the
definition of “investment” in Article I(d) of the Treaty.!* The Claimants also consider the
Respondent’s application of the Salini factors to be “devoid of merit and insubstantial”; first,
because Article 25 of the ICSID Convention does not apply in these proceedings, ' and second,
because importing the Salini factors would be contrary to the plain text of the Treaty and to the

VCLT.!°

The Claimants finally observe that, in considering the Protected Investment Objection, the
Tribunal would irremediably come across factual and legal questions (such as the essential

features of the Claimants’ investments) that are closely linked with the merits of the case.!7”

e) Denial of Justice Objection

The Claimants finally submit that the Denial of Justice Objection fails to meet all three factors in

Glamis Gold v. United States and Philip Morris v. Australia."

First, the Claimants contend that dealing with the Denial of Justice Objection as a preliminary
question would lead to duplication of the analysis of the factual background of the Martinez
Case.'” Second, they claim this objection could not dispose of the whole dispute because the
Notice of Arbitration refers to several violations of the Treaty and international law beyond the

THE RESPONDENT’S APPLICATION FOR SECURITY FOR COSTS

As part of its Triple Application, the Respondent has requested that the Tribunal order the
Claimants to (i) provide a USD 4 million security for its costs of arbitration, in the form of a
guarantee payable on first demand or a deposit held in escrow by the PCA;'*° and (ii) disclose
whether they use third party funding to cover the costs of the arbitration, and, if so, the identity
t. 186

of the third party funder and the terms of any third party funding agreement

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal is empowered to order security for costs, which it
claims would be fully warranted in light of the events following the passing of Mr. Orlandini.'*’
The Respondent first refers to the standard for the Tribunal to impose security for costs (A) and

then explains why that standard is met in the instant case (B).

A. Applicable Standard

The Respondent asserts that the Tribunal has the power to order the Claimants to provide security

for costs in favor of the Respondent under Articles 17(1)'** and 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules.'”

This is evidenced, in the Respondent’s view, by decisions in other investor-State arbitrations!”

and by Section 11 of Procedural Order No. 1, explicitly requiring the Parties to disclose the use

of third party funding. !°!

The Respondent refers to an order in Manuel Garcia Armas v. Venezuela as containing the
applicable test for evaluating security for costs under Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules.” The

four limbs of this test are: (i) whether there is, prima facie, a reasonable prospect that the Tribunal

the measure is not ordered; (iii) whether such harm would substantially outweigh the harm that is
likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted; and
(iv) whether the measure requested is of such urgency that it cannot be postponed until the

issuance of the award.'°

B. Circumstances Warranting Security for Costs

Applying the Manuel Garcia Armas yv. Venezuela test, the Respondent contends that the

circumstances of the present case warrant a security for costs order in its favor.!°4

First, the Respondent submits that there is, prima facie, a reasonable prospect that the Tribunal
will award the Respondent its costs of legal representation. '®* In this regard, the Respondent notes
that the Manuel Garcia Armas y. Venezuela tribunal considered that the respondent’s objections
concerning the dual nationality of the claimants were reasonable and substantiated for purposes
of an application for security for costs.'°° In the Respondent’s view, the same rationale applies to
its jurisdictional objections rationae materiae and rationae personae.'” The Respondent also
notes that the Claimants have failed to provide an estimate of the amount they claim in this
dispute, thus raising doubts about the reasonableness and credibility of the Claimants’ case and

the likelihood that an award will be issued in their favor.'°*

Second, the Respondent asserts that it would likely be precluded from recovering its legal costs
if an award is issued in its favor.'? This is because, in its view, there are “serious doubts”
concerning the Claimants’ ability to honor an award on costs or the existence of assets against
which such an award could be enforced:*” the amount of the residual estate that will be left after

the closing of Mr. Orlandini’s estate is still unclear, as are the finances of the JMO Trust?” or the

solvency of CMO” (which the Claimants themselves have noted has “no other meaningful
assets” other than the Concessions and “ the claims in this proceeding”).”°* The Respondent also
posits that the Claimants’ credit history raises “legitimate concerns”, seeing that Mr. Orlandini
had been involved in several bankruptcy proceedings in the US and other proceedings concerning
debts with his employees in CMO,” while CMO and its assets have been sequestered on several
occasions.””° The Respondent claims that these circumstances led it to invite the Claimants to
disclose whether they are using third party funding, but note that the Claimants are yet to

respond.”°6

Third, the Respondent submits that if its application for security for costs is not granted it will

suffer substantially more harm than the Claimants would suffer if the application was granted.”””

Relying again on Manuel Garcia Armas v. Venezuela, the Respondent argues that there is an actual
risk that its representation and other costs will not be recoverable because it is unclear whether
the Claimants are solvent or are using third party funding.” In contrast, an order requiring
security for costs would, in the Respondent’s view, cause no harm to the Claimants, since they

have already assumed the risk of an adverse decision on costs.?”

Lastly, the Respondent asserts that the requested measure cannot be delayed until a final award is
issued. According to the Respondent, the urgency of its application lies in the increasing amount

of funds destined to its legal representation in this proceeding.?!°

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants request that the Tribunal reject the Respondent’s application for security for cos

  

since it fails to meet the general standard of extreme and exceptional circumstances (A) or the

specific requirements set out in Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules (B).?!!

The Claimants have also provided the following clarification in response to Bolivia’s request that

they confirm whether they have secured third party funding for this arbitration:

[] Bolivia’s request that the Tribunal order the Claimants to confirm whether they have
secured third-party funding is improper, as it is not in accordance with Procedural Order No.
1. Procedural Order No. | provides that the Parties have to send a written notice to the Tribunal
if they have signed a third-party funding agreement to cover the costs of the arbitration. As
long as this event does not occur, the Parties have no obligation to make any general disclosure
of the kind that Bolivia is improperly seeking from the Claimants. Claimants have no
disclosures to make based on Procedural Order No. 1, and Bolivia’s request should be
rejected.2!2

 

A. Applicable Standard

According to the Claimants, “security for costs is an extraordinary measure that is granted only

in the most extreme and exceptional of circumstances,”?!* such as bad faith on the part from whom

security for costs is requested, the likelihood of an irreparable damage or serious misconduct.”!4
The Claimants deny that “[a] general doubt or concern for a party’s inability to pay”,?!° or “even

financial distress and the risk that an adverse costs award will go unpaid”?!° could meet the

standard applicable to a request for security for costs. According to the Claimants, the Respondent

bears the burden of proving’’’ “clearly and sufficiently” that the Claimants are unable or unwilling

to comply with a costs order.?!*

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s reliance on RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia,
where security for costs was granted because the claimant had proven financial difficulties and
also had a track record of failure to pay adverse costs awards in prior proceedings.”!” In the
Claimants’ view, this stands in contrast with their “cooperative attitude” in the present proceeding,
which they claim is evidenced by their timely payment of the first deposit and their agreement to
cover any additional costs that could have resulted from the First Claimant not ratifying all the
actions taken by the Second Claimant following the passing of Mr. Orlandini.?”° The Claimants
note that it is actually the Respondent who, in what they consider was an attempt to “clean its

hands”, paid its share of the deposit only one day before submitting its application for security for

 

The Claimants finally request that the Tribunal decline to follow Manuel Garcia Armas v.
Venezuela. The Claimants assert that the tribunal in that case effectively reversed the burden of
proof by ordering security for costs on the sole basis that a third party funding agreement existed
and did not cover a costs award.” According to the Claimants, this decision “goes against the
very essence of investor-State arbitration” and the standard established by numerous tribunals,

223

creating a risk that “meritorious claims for which no alternative forum exists” will be stifled.

In the Claimants’ view, the Respondent’s argument that “it has not been proven” that the
Claimants, Mr. Orlandini’s heirs or CMO can pay “a hypothetical adverse costs award in favor of

Bolivia” fails to meet the “extreme and exceptional circumstances” standard.?74

B. Circumstances Warranting Rejection of the Security for Costs Application

The Claimants assert that the Respondent also “bears the burden of proof to establish all of the
requirements stated in Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules”, and consider that none of those
requirements are met in the present case.?>>

First, the Claimants claim that the Respondent has failed to establish a plausible defense on the
merits.” The applicable standard in this regard is, according to the Claimants, whether the

2207 228

Respondent’s defenses have a reasonable possibility of success,’ which the Claimants deny.

Second, the Claimants assert that the Respondent has failed to establish a likelihood to be awarded

the costs of this arbitration,’” and note that there is no “blanket right” to be awarded costs under

Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules.”” This is confirmed, the Claimants argue, by the practice of
investment tribunals on the apportionment of costs.”!

Third, the Claimants argue that the Respondent has failed to prove that they would be unwilling
or unable to pay a costs award?” and is improperly seeking to reverse the applicable burden of
proof in this regard. The Claimants contend that the Respondent relies on decades-old events
that do not have any bearing on the Claimants’ current solvency.”™ These include Mr. Orlandini’s

insolvency proceedings in the US from the early 1990s (which were filed by Mr. Orlandini

being declared bankrupt);?*° and certain Bolivian proceedings for default and arrest warrant,
which the Claimants allege refer to the Martinez Case and are strictly connected to the merits of
the dispute.?** Also in connection with the Martfnez Case, the Claimants note that a security for
costs order should not be granted on the basis of financial hardship caused by the State’s actions
that gave rise to the dispute.” Even if the Respondent’s concerns were to be accepted, the
Claimants note that proven financial difficulties do not necessarily warrant security for costs.?*8
The Claimants finally submit that the Respondent’s failure to make timely payment of the initial

deposit should also be taken into consideration in assessing its request.?*°

Fourth, the Claimants contend that the Respondent has failed to prove that the risk of a potentially
unpaid costs award “exceeds greatly” the harm of a security for costs order.“° They contend that
this risk is hypothetical, and in any event minor for a sovereign State, as compared to the
“immediate and significant” harm that a security for costs order would entail for the Claimants.™!

The Claimants add that any financial difficulties on their side derive from the Respondent’s

242

unlawful actions,” and argue that granting the Respondent’s application would further

exacerbate this imbalance and distort the relevant standard in investor-State arbitration.*

Fifth, the Claimants submit that the Respondent has failed to establish the existence of “a current

or imminent risk of irreparable harm”*“*

and merely refers to its purported right to recover the
costs of the arbitration in the event of succeeding on the merits. The Claimants insist that no
such right to recover costs exists and that the alleged risk of harm is “speculative” and cannot
give rise to urgency. The Claimants also repeat their argument that the Respondent has failed
to prove that they would resist or be incapable of facing enforcement of an adverse costs award.”
Sixth, the Claimants consider that upholding the Respondent’s request for security for costs would
be tantamount to pre-judging its jurisdictional objections, since this request is based on the
circumstances of Mr. Orlandini’s death and its concern about past events involving Mr. Orlandini,
mostly relating to the Martinez Case.”4* The Claimants consider this to be contrary to Article
26(3)(b) of the UNCITRAL Rules, and contend, relying on Rurelec v. Bolivia, that the Tribunal
should follow a conservative approach to avoid the risk of prejudgment.”°°

Seventh, and lastly, the Claimants request that the Tribunal take into account the Respondent’s
overall conduct when assessing the Respondent’s security for costs application. This conduct
includes, first, the Respondent’s alleged “harmful retaliatory measures” against CMO through
SENASIR,”*! which, according to the Claimants, are “completely without legal support”, reflect
the Respondent’s bad faith approach and could even amount to a further violation of the Treaty.”
The Claimants also invite the Tribunal to assess Bolivia’s conduct in two other investment
arbitrations (Rurelec v. Bolivia and South American Silver v. Bolivia) where two tribunals rejected

Bolivia’s security for costs applications for reasons that, the Claimants argue, are largely similar

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal has considered and analyzed carefully the positions and the arguments of the Parties
relating to the Respondent’s Triple Application. The Tribunal will proceed to analyze below the

three different parts of the Respondent’s Application.

RESPONDENT’S APPLICATION FOR TERMINATION OR SUSPENSION

The Respondent has advanced four jurisdictional objections. The Respondent submits that the
first of these objections (rationae personae) alone results in a manifest lack of jurisdiction. On
that basis, the Respondent requests that these proceedings be terminated without prejudice

pursuant to Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules.” The Claimants object to this request.

Neither Party has argued that the Tribunal lacks the powers to terminate the proceedings. Indeed,

such power is derived, inter alia, from Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which states:

If, before the award is made, the continuation of the arbitral proceedings becomes unnecessary
i ssible for any reason not mentioned in paragraph 1, the arbitral tribunal shall inform
f its intention to issue an order for the termination of the proceedings. The arbitral
tribunal shall have the power to issue such an order unless there are remaining matters that
may need to be decided and the arbitral tribunal considers it appropriate to do so.

    

Pursuant to this provision, the Tribunal has the power to terminate the proceedings for any reason
not mentioned in para. 1 of Article 36 (which deals with settlement of the dispute) if the
continuation of the proceedings becomes unnecessary or impossible. The Tribunal understands
the Respondent to be arguing that the continuation of the proceeding is unnecessary or impossible

because of the Tribunal’s manifest lack of jurisdiction.?>*

The difficulty the Tribunal has with the Respondent’s argument is that the Tribunal must decide
that it lacks jurisdiction at this initial stage of the proceedings without having been fully briefed
on the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections. Due process requires that the Parties be granted an
opportunity to be heard on the matters pertaining to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and to fully present

their arguments on the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent.

To be clear, there may be situations where the lack of jurisdiction is manifest. ICSID jurisprudence

addresses the existence of a manifest lack of jurisdiction because of the provision in Article 36(3)

Respondent’s Triple Application, paras. 3, 5, 16, 46, 53.

See J. Paulsson, G. Petrochilos, UNCITRAL Arbitration (2017), Kluwer Law International, pp. 333-334
ssible” may include a situation where the tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction over the
dispute and, as a result, decides to terminate the proceedings). See also D. Caron, L. Caplan, The
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary, (2" ed. 2013), Oxford University Press, pp. 788-789.

of the ICSID Convention allowing ICSID’s Secretary-General to decline to register a request for
arbitration if the dispute is manifestly outside of the jurisdiction of the Centre, , as well as because
of ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), which provides for an expedited procedure if a claim is
“manifestly” without legal merit. ICSID jurisprudence also addresses amply the meaning of the
term “manifest” in the context of annulment proceedings pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID
Convention, which allows annulment of an ICSID award in case the tribunal has manifestly

exceeded its powers.

This Tribunal does not operate under the ICSID Convention and does not need to engage in an
analysis of ICSID case law to determine the meaning of the term “manifest.” It is sufficient for

present purposes to rely on the meaning of the term “manifest” in authoritative English or Spanish

language dictionaries, where it is described as “evident,” “obvious,” “readily perceived by the eye
or the understanding.”*° It is nevertheless helpful to note that ICSID tribunals and ad hoc

committees have referred to “manifest” as “obvious by itself,’ “self-evident” rather than the

product of interpretations,”*' “plain on its face” rather than susceptible to argument,” or

“textually obvious.”

The Tribunal is not in a position to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction in a manner that is “evident,”
“obvious” or “readily perceived by the eye or the understanding,” nor that it is “plain on its face”
rather than susceptible to argument, or “textually obvious.” Such would be the case, for example,
if the Claimants relied on a treaty that did not exist or if the applicable treaty explicitly excluded

investor-State arbitration.

Here, by contrast, the Claimants have vigorously disputed the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections and advanced arguments that those objections are not meritorious. To conclude that it
manifestly lacks jurisdiction, the Tribunal must dismiss the Claimants’ arguments off-hand, i.e.,
it must conclude that the Claimants’ arguments manifestly lack merit. Without prejudging in any

way the strength of the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent, the Tribunal

See for example, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Shorter Oxford English Dictionary; Diccionario de la Real
Academia Espanola (defining “manifiesto” as “descubierto, patente, claro”).

believes that it is not in a position to rule on those objections at this stage. The Tribunal needs to
hear from the Parties their fully developed arguments on the jurisdictional objections before it can

reach any conclusion with respect to its jurisdiction.

In that sense, the continuation of the arbitration proceedings is both necessary and possible within
the terms of Article 36(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules. It is necessary because the Tribunal needs to
be fully briefed by the Parties on the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections. Further, the
continuation of the proceedings is possible because the Tribunal is not in a position, at this stage,

to conclude that it lacks jurisdiction.

The Tribunal, therefore, must decline the Respondent’s application to terminate the proceedings

for manifest lack of jurisdiction.

The Respondent argues, in the alternative, that the proceedings must be suspended until the estate

of Mr. Orlandini is closed by the Miami-Dade Court.” In the view of the Respondent, this would

99265

be a “pragmatic solution, given that it is still uncertain who Mr. Orlandini’s future heirs or

beneficiaries may be. The Respondent further argues that the Tribunal is not in a position to
establish that it has jurisdiction until the identity of those heirs or beneficiaries is determined,”
which would then allow the Tribunal to determine whether they meet the relevant jurisdictional

requirements.

In response, the Claimants advance essentially three arguments. First, according to the Claimants,

the investor’s nationality at the time of filing the claim “is what is germane to the Tribunal’s

29267

jurisdiction and, therefore, the identities or nationalities of Mr. Orlandini’s heirs or

beneficiaries are “irrelevant to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”?*

Respondent's Triple Application, paras. 16, 40, 46, 53, 130. The Miami-Dade Court Order (R-17) provides
that “[t]his Estate must be closed within 12 months, unless it is contested or its closing date is extended by
court order”.

Second, according to the Claimants, after Mr. Orlandini’s passing, his claims have remained with
his estate; and Mrs. Orlandini is duly qualified to prosecute Mr. Orlandini’s claims on behalf of
his estate”® as a duly authorized representative of Mr. Orlandini’s estate. The Claimants point out
that, as confirmed by Ms. Martinez-Lejarza, the attorney representing Mrs. Orlandini before the
Miami-Dade Court, Mrs. Orlandini will be the trustee and sole beneficiary of the JMO Trust, as
well as the recipient of the residuary estate.?” On this basis, the Claimants also assert that the

identity of Mr. Orlandini’s heirs is irrelevant.

Third, the Claimants assert that the probate proceeding before the Miami-Dade Court will remain
open until Mr. Orlandini’s claims against Bolivia are fully resolved.” Therefore, in the
Claimants’ view, the suspension of the proceedings would be “impractical.”?””

Similarly to the application for termination, the Respondent’s request for a suspension requires
that the Tribunal rule on matters on which it has not been fully briefed. The Tribunal must give
the Parties full opportunity to submit evidence and present arguments on matters such as: (i) the
existence of a requirement of continuous nationality and its potential application to the facts of
this case; (ii) the relevance, if any, of the identity of Mr. Orlandini’s heirs or the beneficiaries of
the JMO Trust; or (iii) the relevance of the probate proceeding before the Miami-Dade Court and
whether such proceeding can conclude before the disposition of Mr. Orlandini’s (and his estate’ s)

claims in this arbitration.

The Tribunal is not in a position to rule definitively on any of those, or other relevant, matters
without hearing further from the Parties. Moreover, because the Tribunal needs to hear further
from the Parties, the disposition of those matters at the current stage may affect one or the other
Party’s due process rights. The questions raised by the Parties need to be fully aired before this

Tribunal. A suspension of the proceedings would not achieve that objective.

Finally, the Tribunal is reluctant to suspend these proceedings in light of the possibility that the

probate proceeding before the Miami-Dade Court may not be closed until Mr. Orlandini’s claims

proceedings would not only be impractical but place the Claimants in a situation of legal limbo
and this would impede the process of rendering justice. To the extent that such a possibility exists,

the suspension of these proceedings is not justified.

The Tribunal thus concludes that it cannot, at this stage, grant the Respondent’s alternative
application to suspend the arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal notes that the Respondent is not
luded from ing its li for ion if in the course of the arbitration

proceedings evidence emerges that a suspension would better serve the interests of justice.

THE RESPONDENT’S APPLICATION FOR TRIFURCATION

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree to a separate stage of the proceedings
dedicated to damages in case the Tribunal finds jurisdiction and liability. In light of that
agreement, the question the Tribunal needs to decide is whether to hear the matters related to its
jurisdiction and the matters related to the Respondent’s liability in two separate stages or together,

in one stage.

The Tribunal further notes that the Parties do not disagree materially with respect to the applicable
criteria for bifurcating jurisdiction from liability/merits. For example, the Respondent relies on
the decision of the tribunal in Philip Morris v. Australia to identify three criteria for bifurcation:
(i) whether the jurisdictional objections are prima facie serious and substantial; (ii) whether the
jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits; and (iii) whether the jurisdictional
objections, if granted, are capable of disposing of the whole case or an essential part of the case.”
The Respondent also refers to the decision of the tribunal in Philip Morris v. Australia to point
out that a tribunal’s decision on bifurcation must take into consideration the matter of efficiency,
ie., the savings of costs and time that may result from bifurcation.?”

The Claimants have also relied on the criteria articulated by the tribunal in Philip Morris v.
Australia and on the (very similar) criteria articulated by the tribunal in Glamis Gold v. United

States.°”° The Tribunal will also rely on those criteria in its analysis and consideration of the

 

application for bifurcation of the Respondent's jurisdictional objections.

129. The Tribunal is, however, reluctant to engage in an analysis of whether the jurisdictional
objections advanced by the Respondent are serious and substantial. As discussed in the Tribunal’s
analysis of the application for termination, the Tribunal believes that it is premature to form a
view on the seriousness of the objections. Therefore, at this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal
is not prepared to rule that the jurisdictional objections advanced by the Respondent are not

serious or not substantial and deny bifurcating them on that basis.

130. The Tribunal further believes that at least some of the jurisdictional objections, if granted, are
capable of disposing of the entire case or of an essential part of the case. Therefore, the Tribunal

cannot deny bifurcating the jurisdictional objections on that basis either.

131. In the view of the Tribunal, therefore, the key question is whether the jurisdictional objections are
intertwined with the merits (more specifically, with the questions of liability). The Tribunal

believes that they are.

132. For example, while the ratione personae objections relating to Mr. Orlandini’s nationality may
seemingly require only an analysis of legal matters, the Tribunal’s task would be more
complicated if the Tribunal were to find eventually that it needs to decide on Mr. Orlandini’s
“dominant and effective” nationality. Such an inquiry would inevitably lead the Tribunal into an
investigation of factual matters relating to Mr. Orlandini’s actions in relation to his business and
his investments in Bolivia. Further, an analysis of the ratione materiae objections would require
a factual analysis of what rights the Claimants acquired, how, when, etc., which would also

inevitably lead the Tribunal to delve into facts that would also be relevant to liability.

133. The problem that arises out of situations where the jurisdictional objections are, at least in some
respects, intertwined with the merits, is two-fold. First, evidence, such as documents and witness
testimony, relevant to the determination of jurisdiction would also be relevant to the determination
of liability. Thus, assuming the Tribunal finds jurisdiction, the Tribunal will have to review the
same or substantially the same evidence in the next phase of the proceedings, dedicated to liability.
Such an overlap would not contribute to the efficient conduct of the proceedings. It will hardly be
efficient if the same documents would have to be reviewed twice, the same witnesses would have

to be heard twice, etc.

134. Second, and perhaps more significantly, such overlap of evidence may result in due process
concerns. At the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal will need to make certain findings of fact. To

the extent that the same facts are also relevant to liability, and if the Tribunal reaches that stage,

PCA 276769

PCA Case No. 2018-39
July 9, 2019
Page 44 of 49

the Tribunal may have prejudged some of the issues of fact without having heard (at the
jurisdictional stage) all the relevant evidence, which will only become fully available to the

Tribunal at the liability stage.

135. In light of its conclusion that the jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent are, at least
with respect to significant matters of fact, intertwined with the merits, the Tribunal concludes that
bifurcation of the jurisdictional objections is not warranted and that they should be heard together

with the matters of liability.

136. The Tribunal further believes that its decision not to bifurcate jurisdiction from liability is not at
variance with the goal of conducting efficient proceedings. When jurisdictional objections are
raised, there is always the possibility that the tribunal declines jurisdiction. In a unitary
proceeding, such a result would lead to inefficiency in that the parties will have also spent time
and resources arguing the merits. This possibility has to be weighed against the inefficiency of
the tribunal finding jurisdiction after a separate jurisdictional stage and only then proceeding to
the merits. When seeking to determine which of the two alternatives is more likely to result in a
more efficient proceeding, tribunals take into consideration, among other matters, the time, cost
and fees associated with the presentation of the parties’ case on damages, the engagement of

damages experts, etc., which typically constitutes part of the merits stage.

137. Here, however, the Claimants do not oppose bifurcation of the damages stage if jurisdiction and
liability are heard together. A non-bifurcated stage of jurisdiction and liability would not be as
time-consuming and expensive as a non-bifurcated proceeding that also includes damages. If the
Respondent prevails on jurisdiction, additional time and cost will have been spent (unnecessarily)
on presenting the case on liability; however, that additional cost will be less, possibly significantly

so, than the typical case that includes damages.

138. Moreover, trifurcation of the proceedings into jurisdiction, liability and quantum, as requested by
the Respondent, would result (assuming the Claimants are successful on jurisdiction and liability)
in three sequential stages of the proceedings. The Tribunal finds that this would materially prolong
the duration of the proceedings, delay the final disposition of the dispute and cause increased

costs.

139. Thus, the Tribunal has to balance the possibility that the case may be dismissed on jurisdiction
after a separate jurisdictional stage without engaging in the matters of liability and damages

against the possibility that the case will proceed to three separate stages resulting in considerable

length and increased cost of the proceedings.” In light of the totality of the circumstances as
currently known by the Tribunal, and in particular (i) the Tribunal’s conclusion that the
jurisdictional objections are intertwined with the merits, and (ii) the Parties’ agreement to
bifurcate damages, the Tribunal believes that hearing jurisdiction and liability together is more

likely to contribute to the efficient conduct of the proceedings.

THE RESPONDENT’S APPLICATION FOR SECURITY FOR COSTS

The Tribunal begins with the applicable standard. The views of the Parties differ somewhat in that
regard. The Respondent refers to a four-limb test: (i) whether there is, prima facie, a reasonable
prospect that the Tribunal will issue an award in favor of the Respondent including its costs of
legal representation (fumus boni iuris); (ii) whether harm not adequately reparable by an award
of damages may be caused if the measure is not ordered; (iii) whether such harm would
substantially outweigh the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is
directed if the measure is granted; and (iv) whether the measure requested is of such urgency that

it cannot be postponed until the issuance of the award.?””

According to the Claimants, security for costs is “an extraordinary measure” that is granted only

“in the most extreme and exceptional of circumstances.”?”* In the Claimants’ view, “[a] general

o> 279

doubt or concern for a party’s inability to pay”,”” or “even financial distress and the risk that an

59280

adverse costs award will go unpaid’”**° is not sufficient. For the Claimants, the burden is on the

Respondent to prove that the Claimants are unable or unwilling to comply with a costs order.”*!

The Tribunal is reluctant to opine, at this stage of the proceedings, on whether there is a reasonable

prospect of an award of costs in favor or against either Party. To the extent that there is a

 

A third possibility would be that that the Tribunal deals first with jurisdiction alone and then (assuming it
finds jurisdiction) hear liability and quantum together. The Tribunal believes that hearing jurisdiction and
liability first and quantum later (if necessary) is most likely to contribute to the efficient conduct of the
proceedings.

reasonable prospect of an award of costs against the Claimants, there is also a reasonable prospect
of an award of costs against the Respondent. Any pronouncement by the Tribunal on the matter
at this stage would be premature. Therefore, the Tribunal cannot issue a ruling on the
Respondent’s application for security for costs on the basis of whether it is reasonable, or not, to

expect that there would be an award of costs against the Claimants.

That, however, does not mean that a tribunal would be precluded from ordering security for costs
at an early stage of the proceedings if such an order is compelled by other factors. The Tribunal
believes that such factors would include: (i) a claimant’s track record of non-payment of cost
awards in prior proceedings; (ii) a claimant’s improper behavior in the proceedings at issue, such
as conduct that interferes with the efficient and orderly conduct of the proceedings; (iii) evidence
of a claimant moving or hiding assets to avoid any potential exposure to a cost award; or (iv) other

evidence of a claimant’s bad faith or improper behavior.”

The Tribunal observes that other factors, such as third-party funding or a claimant’s serious and
proven financial difficulties, may also play a role in the assessment of whether security for costs
should be ordered. However, those factors should be assessed in the context of all other relevant
circumstances and would typically not, in and of themselves, constitute a sufficient basis for such

an order.

Further, the Tribunal agrees that a balancing test must be applied when considering the potential
harm to a respondent resulting from the non-payment of a cost award and the potential harm to a
claimant resulting from an order of security for costs. The potential harm to a respondent, i.e., the
inability to recover its costs pursuant to a cost award, if no security for costs is ordered, must be
weighed against the potential harm to a claimant, taking into account that: (i) providing security

involves costs of its own; (ii) a claimant should not be required to pay a “fee” for the right to

283 and (iii) a claimant’s

submit a claim (in addition to the filing fees and advance payments);
financial distress may be caused by the respondent’s actions that are the subject of the dispute,
etc. All these circumstances may play a role in striking the right balance when assessing the

potential harm to a claimant or to a respondent.

In applying those tests, the Tribunal takes into account the following factors. First, the Claimants
have paid their share of the advance payment. There is no evidence that the Claimants experienced
financial difficulties in making that payment. Second, pursuant to Section 14.2 of Procedural
Order No. 1, the Second Claimant was to “bear any costs of arbitration, as defined in Article 40
of the UNCITRAL Rules, that may arise from the legal representative of Mr. Orlandini’s estate
not ratifying the actions taken by the Second Claimant in this arbitration.” Although this event
did not arise, the Second Claimant’s acceptance of the Tribunal’s ruling does not evidence
reluctance or inability to make the payments necessary for the conduct of the proceedings. On the
contrary, it demonstrates the Claimants’ willingness to shoulder the necessary financial burden to
ensure the continuation of the proceedings. Third, the Claimants have not engaged in any abuse,
serious misconduct, inappropriate behavior, dilatory tactics or bad faith actions during the course

of these proceedings.

The Parties have presented extensive arguments with respect to the financial situation of the
Claimants and their financial ability, or inability, to comply with a potential costs award. The
Tribunal does not believe that it is necessary, at this stage, to engage in further analysis of the
Claimants’ financial situation. As a factual matter, as noted in the preceding paragraph, the
Claimants have demonstrated their willingness and ability to cover their share of the costs of these
proceedings. As a legal matter, this Tribunal is of the view that financial distress, in and of itself,
does not provide a sufficient basis for ordering security for costs. In that sense, the Tribunal agrees
with the tribunal in EuroGas v. Slovakia that “financial difficulties and third party-funding—
which has become a common practice—do not necessarily constitute per se exceptional

circumstances justifying that the Respondent be granted an order of security for costs.”?**

See for example, Burimi S.R.L. and Eagle Games SH.A y. Albania, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural
Order No. 2, May 3, 2012, para. 41 (“Even if there were more persuasive evidence than that offered by the
Respondent concerning the Claimants’ ability or willingness to pay a possible award on costs, the Tribunal
would be reluctant to impose on the Claimants what amounts to an additional financial requirement as a
condition for the case to proceed.”) (CLA-22).

The Tribunal does not need to opine on the significance of third-party funding for an order of
security for costs. Pursuant to Section 11 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties are required to
“submit a written notice disclosing the use of third party funding to cover the costs of this
arbitration and the identity of the third party funder.” This has not happened and, thus, any
discussion of the relevance of third-party funding to these proceedings is, at this stage,

unnecessary.

It is worth noting, in this context, that the decision of the tribunal in Manuel Garcia Armas v.
Venezuela, which the Parties have discussed extensively in their respective submissions, is
distinguishable from the situation in this case for a number of reasons. Like this Tribunal, the
Manuel Garcia Armas tribunal agreed that the appropriate test is the existence of “exceptional
circumstances.” It concluded, however, that such circumstances existed in that case as a result of

the combination of third-party funding and the insolvency (or the lack of proof of solvency) of

 

the claimants.*> On that basis, the Manuel Garcia Armas tribunal found that, on balance, the
claimants’ harm (in providing security for costs through their third-party funder) did not outweigh
the potential harm to Venezuela.”*° Whether one agrees with the Manuel Garcia Armas tribunal
or not, the situation in the present case is different, as discussed above, and the Tribunal is

therefore not persuaded that exceptional circumstances exist.

Finally, the Tribunal agrees that the urgency of an order of security for costs is a matter to be duly
taken into consideration. However, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent’s arguments
on urgency. The argument advanced by the Respondent is that it will continue to incur costs and
fees, the amounts of which will increase as the proceedings advance.”*’ There is no sufficient
evidence, however, that the financial situation of the Claimants is such that an order of security
for costs is urgent. In particular, there is no evidence that the Claimants may be in a position to
provide security for costs today but would lose that ability in the future. The Tribunal notes that

the Respondent is of course free to renew its application should the circumstances change.

On balance, for all the reasons discussed above, the Tribunal is not persuaded that circumstances

exist that warrant an order of security for costs.
