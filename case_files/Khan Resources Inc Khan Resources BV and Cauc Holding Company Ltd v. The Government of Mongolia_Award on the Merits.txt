BIFURCATION AND OTHER PROCEDURAL MATTERS

On 13 July 2011, the Tribunal circulated for the Parties’ comments draft Terms of Appointment
and a draft Procedural Order No.1.

On 26 July 2011, following an exchange of correspondence between the Parties and a
procedural telephone conference, the Tribunal circulated a finalized version of the Terms of

Appointment to the Parties and issued Procedural Order No. 1.
Article 4 of the Terms of Appointment describes the applicable procedural rules as follows:

4.1 In accordance with Article 26 of the Treaty and Article 12 of the Founding Agreement,
the parties agree that the proceedings shall be conducted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules 2010.

4.2 For issues not dealt with in the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010, the Tribunal shall
apply the rules that the Parties have agreed upon. In the absence of such agreement, the
Tribunal shall apply the rules it deems appropriate.

The Terms of Appointment also reflect the Parties’ choice of English as the language of
arbitration, Paris as the place of arbitration and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) as

Registry.

Procedural Order No. | set forth, among other procedural matters, a timetable for submissions

and a date for a hearing on bifurcation of the proceedings.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties made submissions on bifurcation in the
course of July, August and September 2011. The hearing on bifurcation was held on
19 September 2011 in Paris. The Parties each submitted a post-hearing brief on bifurcation on

26 September 2011.

On 4 October 2011, the Respondents informed the Tribunal, and the Claimants confirmed, that
the Parties had reached agreement on the procedural issues that had been submitted for
determination by the Tribunal during the hearing on bifurcation. More specifically, the Parties
agreed “to having all of the [c]laims heard and resolved in a single, consolidated proceeding
before this Tribunal” and “to having the Tribunal hear all of Respondents’ remaining objections
to jurisdiction in a separate jurisdictional phase, according to the schedule set forth in Section
3A of Procedural Order No. 1.” The Tribunal endorsed and confirmed the Parties’ agreement in

Procedural Order No. 2, dated 6 October 2011.

On 24 October 2011, Maitre Fortier disclosed that his law firm, Norton Rose OR, would, on
1 January 2012, merge with the firm Macleod Dixon, and that Macleod Dixon was acting for

Khan Canada. Maitre Fortier informed the Parties that he had no knowledge with respect to this

lawsuit and that he would resign from Norton Rose OR as of 31 December 2011. On the same

HEARING ON THE MERITS AND QUANTUM

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, on 14 October 2013, the Claimants and the Respondents
each filed a Pre-Hearing Brief (“Claimants’ Pre-Hearing Brief’ and “Respondents’ Pre-

Hearing Brief’).

After conferring, by e-mail dated 21 October 2013, the Parties submitted to the Tribunal a joint
proposal concerning certain hearing logistics, including an agreed hearing schedule, and
informed the Tribunal of outstanding areas of disagreement regarding procedural matters for
the hearing. The e-mail included each Party’s notification of the witnesses it wished to cross-

examine.

By letter dated 22 October 2013, the Respondents requested that one of their witnesses,
Mr. Wallace Mays, whom the Claimants had not expressed a wish to cross-examine, be allowed
to testify. By letter of the next day, the Claimants objected to the Respondents’ request and
indicated that, should the Tribunal allow Mr. Mays to testify, the Claimants would want to file
six new factual exhibits. The Respondents replied by letter dated 28 October 2013, re-iterating
their application regarding Mr. Mays and objecting to the filing of the new exhibits.

A pre-hearing conference call was held on 31 October 2013 between the Parties and the
Presiding Arbitrator. A complete transcript of the call and minutes summarizing key points

were circulated to the Parties and the Tribunal.

On 8 November 2013, following a letter from the Respondents on 4 November 2013 and an e-
mail response by the Claimants on the same date, the Tribunal refused the Respondents’
application for Mr. Mays to be called at the hearing and said that it would destroy the six

documents that it had been provided with by the Claimants in connection thereof.

On the same date, at the request of the Presiding Arbitrator, the Parties submitted an updated

hearing schedule agreed between them.

The hearing on merits and quantum was held at the ICC Hearing Center in Paris from 11 to 15

November 2013. Present at the hearing were:

the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, providing, inter alia, a timetable for the filing of
two rounds of short post-hearing submissions, submissions on costs and the joint submission by

the Parties of an agreed chronology of main events and facts.

On 20 December 2013, the Parties, unable to agree upon a single chronology of main events
and facts, submitted separate versions to the Tribunal.
On 31 December 2013, after having conferred, the Parties each submitted their respective

changes to the transcript that had been agreed by the other Party.

Award on the Merits

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 5, on 5 February 2014, the Parties each filed a first post-
hearing brief (““Claimants’ First Post-Hearing Brief” and “Respondents’ First Post-Hearing
Brief”).

By letter dated 27 February 2014, the Claimants requested permission from the Tribunal to
submit an attachment to their second post-hearing submission to address what they alleged to
be improper citations in the Respondents’ First Post-Hearing Brief. The Respondents objected

to this request by letter dated 5 March 2014.

By letter from the PCA dated 11 March 2014, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’ request,
specifying that each Party would be allowed to file an attachment to their second post-hearing
submission to briefly address any alleged improper citations or misstatements in the other

Party’s First Post-Hearing Brief.

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 5, on 11 April 2014, the Parties each filed a second post-
hearing brief (“Claimants’ Second Post-Hearing Brief’ and “Respondents’ Second Post-
Hearing Brief’) and a costs submission (“Claimants’ Submission on Costs” and
“Respondents’ Submission on Costs”). In addition, the Claimants filed a Table of

Respondents’ Improper Citations.

On 15 April 2014, the R d bmitted a letter disputing the reasonabl of the

Claimants’ reported costs.

On 8 May 2014, after having been invited by the Tribunal to do so, the Claimants responded to
the Respondents’ letter of 15 April 2014, dismissing it as “frivolous and unsupported,” and
maintaining their submission that the Respondents should bear the “full and reasonable costs”
of this arbitration. The Respondents submitted a letter in response the next day (on 9 May
2014), requesting that the Tribunal order the Claimants “to disclose the fee arrangement
between the Claimants and their Counsel in its entirety,” including details concerning its

claimed “success fee.”

On 15 May 2014, the Presiding Arbitrator notified the Parties that, “should the Tribunal decide
to make a costs award in favour of the Claimants, the Tribunal would require a full
understanding of the success fee arrangement,” and he directed the Claimants to “provide either
(i) the success fee arrangement or (ii) correspondence relating to the success fee that evidences
the terms of the agreement” within seven days. On 30 May 2014, the Presiding Arbitrator
acknowledged receipt of additional information from Claimants and another letter from
Respondents, noting that “the Tribunal considers that it has sufficient information to make a
costs determination, but will inform the parties if the need for further information arises in the

future.”

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
THE DORNOD PROJECT

From 1988, commencing under the communist Mongolian People’s Republic, to 1995, the
Russian state-owned company Priargunsky Production Mining and Chemical Enterprise
(“Priargunsky”) extracted uranium oxide from an open pit mine, known as Deposit No. 2 or
Ore Body No. 2 (“Deposit No. 2”), located in Dornod, a province in northeast Mongolia.’ Due
to a shortage of funds and a drop in demand for uranium after the dissolution of the U.S.S.R. in

1991, the mine was shut down in mid-1995.°

Around the same time, Priargunsky and the Mongolian state-owned company Mongol-Erdene
(“Erdene’) formed, with the U.S. company WM Mining Inc. (“WM Mining”), a joint venture
known as the Central Asian Uranium Company Ltd. (“CAUC’”), in order to develop a uranium
exploration and extraction project in Dornod (“Dornod Project”). WM Mining was wholly

owned by Mr. Wallace Mays.’

The founders of CAUC executed the following three documents: (i) the Founding Agreement,
(ii) the Agreement on Development of Mineral Deposits in Eastern Aimak (Province) of
Mongolia between WM Mining, Priargunsky and Erdene (“Minerals Agreement”) and (iii) the
Charter of the Company with Limited liability “Central Asian Uranium Company of Mongolia”
of the Mongolian-Russian-American Venture.’ The Minerals Agreement also was signed by an
authorized representative of the Mongolian Ministry of Energy, Geology, and Mining.”
Pursuant to the Minerals Agreement, WM Mining was to contribute “monetary funds and the

services related to locating and obtaining financing for the joint venture.”"

Initially, each of the three parties held an equal 33.3 percent share of the joint venture. On
12 December 1996, the parties entered into the Agreement on CAUC’s Share Redistribution
(“Share Redistribution Agreement”), pursuant to which WM Mining’s participation in
CAUC was increased to 58 percent in consideration for an additional financial contribution to

the joint venture."!

In 2003, through a series of transactions, Khan Canada became the indirect holder of WM
Mining’s shares in CAUC. In July 1997, WM Mining had transferred its shares in CAUC to
World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc, a British Virgin Islands company that was also wholly
owned by Mr. Mays.'? In October 2002 and January 2003, Mr. Mays incorporated Khan
Canada and Khan Resources Bermuda Ltd (“Khan Bermuda”), respectively.'* On 30 July
2003, Mr. Mays transferred his shares in World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc. to Khan
Bermuda.'* On 31 July 2003, all of Mr. Mays’s shares in Khan Bermuda were transferred to
Khan Canada.'* Following Khan Canada’s acquisition of World Wide Mongolia Mining Inc.,
the latter was renamed CAUC Holding on 28 April 2004.

As for Erdene’s share in CAUC, it was successively transferred to the Mineral Resources
Authority of Mongolia (“MRAM”) on 27 November 2001, the State Property Committee of
Mongolia (“SPC”) on 28 March 2005, and MonAtom, a Mongolian company wholly owned
and controlled by the SPC, in 2009.'°

When this arbitration commenced in 2011, Priargunsky and MonAtom each held a 21 percent
share in CAUC, while CAUC Holding, the wholly owned subsidiary of Khan Bermuda (itself
the wholly owned subsidiary of Khan Canada), held the remaining 58 percent share in CAUC.

On 27 March 2003, Khan Canada established a separate subsidiary incorporated in Mongolia —
Khan Resources LLC (“Khan Mongolia”) — to help coordinate its activities in Mongolia.'’
Originally, all of the shares in Khan Mongolia were held by Khan Bermuda. On 5 September
2007, Khan Netherlands was incorporated for the purpose of holding Khan Mongolia. On 28
May 2008, the Foreign Investment and Trade Agency of Mongolia (the “FIFTA”) issued a
“Certificate of Foreign Incorporated Company” recording the transfer of 75 percent of the
shares in Khan Mongolia to Khan Netherlands and indicating that the other 25 percent

remained with Khan Bermuda.'*

As background to their decision to invest in Mongolia, the Claimants allege that in recent years
Mongolia’s economy has become one of the “fastest growing in the world” due to its mineral

wealth and a twenty-plus year campaign to attract foreign investment by creating “the

The Respondents explain that, after its transition into democracy in 1990, Mongolia spent
considerable time and effort to encourage foreign investment, especially from countries other
than Russia and China. In the uranium sector in particular, Mongolia wished to benefit from
foreign capital and experience.”

According to Claimants, Khan “always had a champion within the Mongolian Government,””!

citing assistance and praise received in 2007-2009 from various Mongolian state officials.”” In
light of these reassurances, Khan did not perceive any special “risk” associated with its

investing in Mongolia.

THE ACQUISITION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION LICENSES

On 10 November 1998, the joint venture company CAUC obtained Mineral Exploitation
License Number 237A (“Mining License”), which allowed CAUC to engage in the
exploitation of radioactive mineral resources in an area of land covering both Deposit No. 2 and
an underground mineral deposit known as Deposit No. 7 or Ore Body No. 7 (“Deposit No.

py

On 12 September 2000, on CAUC’s application (aimed at tax and fee savings), the Mining
License area was reduced to less than a third of its size.*> The new Mining License area (the

“Main Property”) excluded a segment of Deposit No. 7.

On 22 April 2005, Khan Mongolia acquired Mineral Exploitation License 9282X
(“Exploration License,” collectively with the Mining License, the “Mining and Exploration
Licenses”), covering the segment of Deposit No. 7 that had previously been excluded from the

Mining License area (the “Additional Property”).”°

THE CLAIMANTS’ INTENTIONS REGARDING THE DORNOD PROJECT

The Claimants allege that they were committed to bringing the Dornod Project into production
and were “ideally situated” to help Mongolia develop its uranium resources.”’ In their First
Post-Hearing Brief, they state that Khan “reasonably expected to bring the Dornod Project into
operation in collaboration with Mongolia.”’* They gathered an experienced board of directors
and management team and hired highly qualified employees.” They recount investing over
USD 50 million.*° Furthermore, Khan independently verified the existence and extent of
uranium reserves at the Dornod site by conducting a diamond drilling program and filing a

technical report that complied with Canadian (and international) regulatory criteria.

In 2006-2007, Khan secured financing for the Dornod Project, including approximately
USD 14 million in seed money from private investors, USD 6.3 million in an initial public
offering on the Toronto Stock Exchange and USD 25 million in a follow-on offering.” These

funds were devoted to the development of the Dornod Project.*

the exclusion of a segment of Deposit No. 7 from the reduced Mining License area was due to a surveying
error. Following discovery of this error, the MRAM issued a decision to restore the Mining License to its
original size and coordinates. However, in the intervening time, licenses had been issued over a portion of
this area to other parties that successfully challenged the MRAM’s decision before the Capital City
Administrative Court of Mongolia. Memorial, 44-45. Given the joint venture’s lack of capital, Khan took
it upon itself to purchase the Exploration License from Western Prospector Group Ltd. for “the ultimate
benefit of the Project.” Memorial, 46-47. The Respondents emphasize that Khan Canada first entered into
an agreement with Western Prospector in accordance with which Western Prospector would transfer to Khan
Canada the portion of its exploration license covering the Additional Property and that only then did Western
Prospector obtain the Exploration License. Statement of Defence, fj 46-47. The Respondents also note that
the other CAUC shareholders were not informed of Khan Mongolia’s acquisition of the Exploration License.

Claimants’ First Post-Hearing Brief, p. 10. The Claimants provide the following reasons for this expectation:
The Dornod Project already had a history of development; Mongolia’s actions in entering into and
performing the Agreements over a period of years demonstrated its commitment to further developing the
Dornod Project with the assistance of a foreign investor; Mongolia’s actions in the years leading up to
Khan’s i further that it foreign mining inves , including in particular
Canadian investment; Mongolia accepted Khan as a “new investor” in the Dornod Project and the CAUC
joint venture after its prior partner proved unable to advance the project; shortly after Khan’s investment, the
MRAM agreed that the area now covered by the Exploration License should be reunified with the area
covered by CAUC’s Mining License, expressly citing to the Minerals Agreement as the basis for its action;
Khan was subsequently able to acquire the Exploration License from a third party, thus enabling the joint
venture parties to achieve commercial production from Deposit No. 7; Khan significantly advanced the
Dornod Project towards production by hiring highly qualified professionals, carrying out comprehensive
studies, and raising financing for the project; and Khan maintained positive relations with the Government
during the course of its investment in the Dornod Project, and Mongolia consistently acted in support of that
project in the exercise of its public authority. See Claimants’ First Post-Hearing Brief, pp. 10-11. See also

After obtaining these funds, Khan continued its drilling program, complemented by a
magnetometer and gravity survey, and conducted three studies providing an extensive analysis
of, among others, the resources and reserves at the site and the costs and methodologies

required to exploit the mine in an economically feasible manner.**

The last of these studies was the Definitive Feasibility Study of 4 May 2009 (“DFS”), which
estimated the capital cost for constructing the mining and surface facilities to be in excess of
USD 330 million, with a rate of return of the Dornod Project, after taxes, at 29 percent. The

DFS also “conservatively” estimated the Dornod Project’s net value at USD 276 million.*

In addition, Khan retained and funded expert firms to conduct environmental and social

assessments, and devoted funds to infrastructure construction in Mongolia.*®

With regard to the Respondents’ allegation that the Claimants’ exploration work reproduced
exploration surveys carried out when Priargunsky operated the Dornod site, the Claimants
“readily acknowledge that significant exploration data was developed by Priargunsky before
1995,” but explain that the data was not verifiable or reproducible because “the underlying
exploration material (e.g., the drill core) was destroyed when Priargunsky abandoned the site.”
Thus, over 8,000 metres of additional drilling were performed to verify and expand upon

Priargunsky’s data.

Moreover, according to the Claimants, Priargunsky had neither conducted social and
environmental impact assessments, nor developed mining plans or engineered processing and
support facilities.*” Furthermore, the Claimants dispute the Respondents’ allegation that the
Claimants did not share the results of their studies with Mongolia, submitting that had Khan’s
studies duplicated Priargunsky’s work, there would have been no need for Khan to share the

results with Mongolia.** The Claimants add that Khan shared its studies with Mongolia.”

The Claimants also aver that Mongolia knew and accepted that Khan Canada was the ultimate
owner and controller of the majority share in CAUC, as well as the ultimate source of financing
of the Dornod Project. For instance, on 22 September 2005, the SPC issued a resolution
proposing to offer Khan Canada its 21 percent interest in CAUC, thus recognizing, as

Claimants argue, that Khan Canada was a “potential source of immediate and substantial cash”

and was “the party to deal with on matters relating to CAUC.”””

Regarding the Respondents’ argument that Khan could not have expected to bring the Dornod
Project to production as it needed to obtain additional approvals from Mongolia before the
commencement of mine operations, the Claimants emphasize that “Mongolia was obliged by
the mandatory terms of Mongolian public laws (as well as by its contractual duty of good faith)
to grant such approvals.”*' Its related argument on the issue of the conversion of the

Exploration License into a mining license is discussed in Section V(B) below.

In contrast, the Respondents allege that “Khan never intended to take this project forward into
operation,” but, rather, was focused on maximizing the value of Khan Canada in order to sell
off its interests at a profit.” They argue that, when Khan became a partner in CAUC, its main
priorities were its Mongolian gold properties, which it did not develop, but proceeded to sell for
a profit.” The Respondents contend that Khan did not have the capability to develop the mining

4

project on its own,“ noting that “Khan has never taken a project into production” and

reiterating that it “would not have taken this one forward.’”“* The Respondents further contend

that the market conditions during this time were unfavourable to the Dornod Project.“

The Respondents emphasize that in the seventeen-year existence of CAUC, there have been no
mining activities at the Dornod site,”” with the possible exception of a few holes having been

drilled.“* They note that “Khan’s only tangible activity was to obtain information in Russia

regarding the mineral reserves.”

While acknowledging that Khan carried out drilling programs, updated its evaluation of the
Dornod deposit reserves and completed various feasibility reports, the Respondents emphasize
that Khan Canada would notify the results of its activities to its shareholders in “an attempt to
boost its share price” on the Toronto Stock Exchange, but consistently fail to inform its partners
in CAUC ™ or the Mongolian authorities.*' They submit that from 2002 to 2007 there was no

communication between the CAUC joint venture partners, as not a single management

conducted until September 2007.°*

Further, the Respondents note that, already in 2006, Khan Canada was preparing for a takeover
by adopting an amended shareholders’ rights plan “to ensure the fair treatment of shareholders

in connection with any take-over offer for the Corporation.”*™*

They submit that, as of July 2009, the actual production of the uranium mine was at least three
years away,” as the Claimants had secured neither a strategic partner for the development of
the project nor an off-take agreement, pursuant to which the bulk of the financing was to be
obtained.” They state that “[t]he reality is that the Claimants were not capable of raising the

157

necessary capita and conclude that “Khan had neither the internal capital necessary nor the

stature necessary to raise capital, to take the properties into production.”

MONGOLIA’S INVESTIGATION OF CAUC AND KHAN MONGOLIA’S ACTIVITIES AND THE
INVALIDATION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION LICENSES

In April 2005, and, again, in May 2006, the State Specialized Inspection Agency of Mongolia
(“SSIA”) inspected the Dornod site, reporting several violations of Mongolian law, including
breaches of the Radiation Protection and Safety Law.”

On 6 February 2007, Mongolia designated the Dornod mineral deposits as being “of strategic

importance” pursuant to the Minerals Law of 30 October 2006 (“2006 Minerals Law”).

On 14 September 2007, Khan applied to convert the Exploration License into a mining
license.*' On 27 November 2007, the Mongolian Mineral Resource and Petroleum Activity
Authority (the predecessor of the MRAM) informed Khan that the decision on its application
would be deferred until the Mongolian Minerals Council had reviewed the Dornod reserve

estimates registered in the State Integrated Registry.

CAUC in contemplation of the transfer of the SPC’s interest to Erdene, informed
Mr. Enkhbayar, Khan’s legal representative in Mongolia, of several breaches by Khan of the

Minerals Agreement, the Founding Agreement and the Share Redistribution Agreement.

The Respondents argue that the Claimants breached their obligations to the joint venture, as
follows: Khan breached Articles 1.2, 1.3 and 5.1 of the Minerals Agreement by taking six years
to prepare a definitive feasibility study whereas it was obliged to conduct two feasibility studies
within the year; Khan breached the Share Redistribution Agreement by not having provided a
loan of USD 30-35 million, which was the condition for the increased shareholding in the joint
venture;°> and Khan breached Article 16.2 of the Minerals Agreement, which stated that
production should not be suspended by longer than two years, by not carrying out the
production of yellowcake (the final product of uranium mining) for the two years following its

acquisition of an interest in the joint venture in July 2003.

On 29 August 2008, on the basis of the results of its drilling program, Khan filed for the
registration by the Minerals Council of a re-estimation of the Dornod mineral reserves.©” In

October 2009, a “Team of Experts” was appointed to review Khan’s application and, in

1,8

December 2009, this team submitted a report to the Minerals Council The Claimants contend

that this report recommended the registration of Khan’s re-estimation of the reserves, while the

Respondents note that it identified “a number of deficiencies and missing information.””

Between 15 and 21 April 2009, the SSIA again inspected the Dornod site.”” On 10 July 2009,
the SSIA issued a report (“July 2009 SSIA Report”) that raised several alleged violations of
Mongolian law.’! The Respondents also allege that, before the July 2009 SSIA Report, the

In respect of the 2009 SSIA inspection, the Claimants allege that “the SSIA inspectors were
instructed to concoct as many violations as possible,””> and stress that the July 2009 SSIA
Report was issued to the MRAM, and not to CAUC, such that the Claimants first saw it only
when the MRAM forwarded it to them two weeks after the Mining and Exploration Licenses
were suspended.” The Claimants add that they had not seen the April 2009 SSIA Report before

the Respondents filed it in this arbitration.”*

On 10 July 2009, the MRAM informed CAUC of the suspension of the Mining License for a
period of three months due to the results of the 2009 SSIA inspection (“Suspension Notice”),

and, in the Respondents’ view, Khan’s failure to remedy the alleged legal violations.”°

In September 2009, CAUC challenged the temporary suspension of the Mining License before
the Capital City Administrative Court (“Administrative Court”).’’ However, the parties

reached a settlement, which was recognized by the Administrative Court on 12 January 2010.”

On 15 August 2009, Mongolia enacted the Nuclear Energy Law of Mongolia (“NEL”) and the
Law on Procedures for Compliance with the NEL (“LPCNEL”), which, inter alia, created a
Nuclear Energy Agency (“NEA”) and provided that Mongolia was to take ownership, without
compensation, of “no less that 51 percent of stake in the joint company, where exploration and

determination of [uranium] reserve have been conducted with state budget.”

On 8 October 2009, the NEA issued Order No. 141, suspending 149 uranium exploration and
mining licenses including the Mining and Exploration Licenses, pending their re-registration
under the NEL (“Order No. 141”). The NEA confirmed the effect of Order No. 141 on the
Exploration and Mining Licenses by issuing its Notices Nos. 447 and 448 to CAUC and Khan

Mongolia, respectively (“Temporary Invalidation Notices”).*!

On 22 January 2010, Khan Canada and MonAtom signed a Memorandum of Understanding
(“2010 MOU”), providing for the re-registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses in
exchange for CAUC accepting the NEL’s 51 percent ownership requirement, free of charge,

the Mining License." According to the Claimants, the 2010 MOU contained the principal terms

for a new joint venture agreement, operator agreement and investor agreement.**

By declaration
dated 29 January 2010, the NEA refused to implement it.** Nevertheless, the Claimants allege
that Mr. Sodnom Enkbakht, the then Director of the NEA, had confirmed Mongolia’s

agreement with the 2010 MOU’s terms in earlier discussions.

In March 2010, an SSIA “Inspection Group” composed of officials of the SSIA, the SPC, the
NEA and MonAtom conducted another inspection of the Dornod site. In a report dated
15 March 2010, the inspectors found that neither CAUC nor Khan Mongolia had remedied the
violations of Mongolian law identified in 2009, and listed further alleged breaches of the
Founding Agreement, the Minerals Agreement and the NEL,"° relating specifically to the
financing and pre-emption rights set out in the Founding Agreement and the Minerals
Agreement (collectively, “Agreements”) that were allegedly violated when Khan acquired its
interest in CAUC in 2003.*’ On 9 April 2010, the NEA issued notices to CAUC and Khan
Mongolia, respectively, invalidating the Mining and Exploration Licenses (“Permanent

Invalidation Notices”).**

On 15 and 23 April 2010, Khan Mongolia and CAUC each commenced proceedings against the
NEA before the Administrative Court to challenge the Temporary Invalidation Notices and the

Permanent Invalidation Notices.”

On 19 July 2010, in the proceedings initiated by CAUC, the Administrative Court rendered a
decision concerning the Mining License, stating that its invalidation was “clearly not lawful.”””

Similarly, on 2 August 2010, in the proceedings initiated by Khan Mongolia, the
Administrative Court rendered a decision concerning the Exploration License, stating that its

April 2010 invalidation was “clearly invalid.”*!

The NEA appealed the Administrative Court’s decision in the case involving CAUC before the
Appellate Court of the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court of Mongolia

Parties hold different views as to the effect of this decision, as described in Section V(E)

below.”

The Parties agree that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were not re-issued after the
purported April 2010 invalidation. On 11 November 2010, in a declaration published in the
Mongolian press, the NEA stated that “the renewal of special permits by [CAUC and Khan
Mongolia] [was] not a possibility.”°* On 15 December 2012, the NEA issued notices to CAUC
and Khan Mongolia respectively, reiterating that the Mining and Exploration Licenses would

not be re-registered.”*

Khan maintained the Dornod site on a care and maintenance basis until 2012, when it “decided
to minimize its losses and to vacate the mine site.”°* Khan was subsequently delisted from the
Toronto Stock Exchange as no longer possessing a “property of merit” and, in April 2012, was

The Parties disagree as to whether the inspections, license suspensions and license invalidations
to which Khan was subjected in 2009 and 2010 were intended to expel Khan from CAUC to
allow for a strictly Mongolian-Russian joint venture to develop Mongolia’s uranium projects in

the Dornod region.”

According to the Claimants, it is “only in the light of the prior agreement by the Russia-
Mongolia joint venture to exclude Khan from the Dornod Project that the arbitrary, erratic and
often self-contradictory behaviour of the Government throughout the course of 2009-2010 can
be explained.””* More specifically, “Mongolia’s decision to oust Khan from Dornod had

everything to do with its relationship with Russia and the formation of a new joint venture

between MonAtom and RosAtom.””

The Claimants allege that Russia and Mongolia became interested in developing the Dornod

Project to the exclusion of Khan after Khan had demonstrated its value by: (i) communicating

and (iv) announcing on 11 March 2009 that the DFS established the economic feasibility of the

They further allege that it was following an announcement in January 2009 by representatives
of Mongolia and RosAtom that they planned to create a Mongolian-Russian joint venture for

the “development of uranium deposits”!

that Mongolia undertook related administrative
actions against Khan, which culminated in the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration
Licenses and the NEA’s refusal to reinstate them.'®* Furthermore, during a visit by the then
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to Mongolia in August 2009, the press reported that
Russia and Mongolia had agreed that their joint venture would specifically “focus on the

Dornod deposit.”"°°

As the most compelling evidence of collusion between Mongolia and Russia, the Claimants
refer to a 3 March 2010 letter from RosAtom in which it thanks the NEA for rejecting the 2010
MOU and informs it of RosAtom’s failure to enact a hostile takeover of Khan Canada.'"’ The
Claimants note that the Respondents do not address this “smoking gun.”"”* They also refer to a
statement made by the Chairman of the SPC on 7 October 2010 (which he later retracted) that

Russian pressure accounted for the ousting of Khan from the Dornod Project.”

Finally, the Claimants note that, following news that the Mining and Exploration Licenses
would not be renewed, RosAtom publicly announced that a Russian-Mongolian joint venture

would soon be established.'"”

The Respondents strongly reject the Claimants’ allegations, asserting that while discussions
occurred between the Mongolian and Russian Governments on “a general level,” these were not

aimed at ousting Khan from the Dornod Project. In fact, the agreements contemplated would

V. THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS ON LIABILITY

101. The Claimants contend that the Respondents (and Mongolia, in particular) unlawfully deprived
the Claimants of both their investment, in the form of the Mining and Exploration Licenses, and
their contractual rights under the Agreements. The Claimants also bring claims against the

Respondents for the breach of the duties of good faith and loyalty in relation to the Parties’

joint venture and for treatment in contravention of Mongolian and international law.

102. The Claimants identify the following factual bases for their claims:

26 Exhibit CLA-53 (art. 10).
27 Exhibit CLA-53 (art. 13).

21

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

(i) the temporary suspension of the Mining License on 10 July 2009;

(ii) the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL and the subsequent invalidation of the
Mining and Exploration Licenses;

(iii) the alleged refusal of Mongolia to comply with the decisions of its administrative
courts, which required it to reinstate the Mining and Exploration Licenses; and

(iv) the wrongful undermining of the Claimants’ business reputation through the
media.!

103. The Respondents dispute the Claimants’ interpretation of events and deny being liable for any

of the actions taken.

104. Underlying the general framework of the Claimants’ claims as summarized above are separate
claims brought by the individual Claimants pursuant to different arbitration agreements and

invoking different legal standards.

105. Khan Canada and CAUC Holding bring claims against Mongolia and MonAtom pursuant to the
arbitration agreement in Article 12 of the Founding Agreement for the deprivation of their
rights in relation to the Mining License and the Agreements, as well as for the Respondents’
failure to act in good faith for the advancement of the joint venture. They bring their claims on
the following bases:

(i) Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement, which states that “[p]roperty of the
Company [CAUC] will not be subject to requisition or confiscation;”

(ii) Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law, which entitles foreign investment in
Mongolia to legal protection;

(iii) Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law, which prohibits the unlawful
expropriation of foreign investment within the territory of Mongolia;

(iv) Article 9 of the Foreign Investment Law, which obliges Mongolia to accord
foreign investors treatment no less favourable than the treatment accorded to
Mongolian investors;

(v) _ the duty of good faith as reflected in Article 13 of the 2002 Civil Code;
(vi) _ the duty of loyalty as reflected in Article 83 of the Company Law; and

(vii) the international minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary
international law (against Mongolia only).'””

106. In turn, Khan Netherlands brings claims against Mongolia pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT for
the deprivation of its rights under the Exploration License, as well as for Mongolia’s failure to
act in good faith for the advancement of the joint venture. The Respondents submit that the
claims brought under the ECT must be limited to those relating to the indirect interest of Khan

Netherlands in the Additional Property, in the form of its 75 percent ownership of Khan

Mongolia, the holder of the Exploration License.'*” Khan Netherlands brings its claims on the

following bases:

(i) Article 13 of the ECT;

(ii) the umbrella clause set out in Article 10.1 of the ECT, in relation to Mongolia’s
obligations under the Foreign Investment Law; and

(iii) _ the fair and equitable treatment obligation set out in Article 10.1 of the ECT."

107. The Claimants also contend that the Tribunal must apply the international minimum standard as

an independent basis for its decision on those issues to which Mongolian law applies if it finds
that the Constitution does not require Mongolia to uphold this standard or if the protection

132

offered by Mongolian law falls below it.

108. While the Parties do not dispute the framework under which the Claimants bring their claims,

they disagree regarding the interaction of these different legal standards in application to these
proceedings as well as the nature of the investment in question, with specific regard to the
alleged unity of investment comprising the Mining and Exploration Licenses. Subsequent

sections discuss these issues as well as the Parties’ other arguments on the merits.

PRELIMINARY ARGUMENTS ON THE APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARDS

The Claimants’ position

109. The Claimants submit that the legal standards that apply to the claims of Khan Canada and

CAUC Holding, on the one hand, and those of Khan Netherlands, on the other hand, are
“closely intertwined at every level of the analysis.”'*> The Claimants also submit that
Mongolian law was intended to coincide with international law, which means that the latter

should assist in the interpretation of the former.'**

The cor ding provisions of the ECT and the Foreign Investment Law are substantial

identical.

110. The Claimants contend that the corresponding provisions of the ECT and the Foreign

Investment Law are substantially identical For example, Article 13 of the ECT (that allows

expropriations only if they are in the public interest, not discriminatory, carried out under due

and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law (with Article 8.2 prohibiting unlawful expropriation and

Article 8.3 stating that investments may be expropriated only for the public interest in

111. With respect to their claims concerning their treatment and that of their investments, the

135
136

146

Claimants raise a number of points. First, they note that Khan Netherlands invokes the umbrella
clause in Article 10.1 of the ECT to raise claims for breaches of the Foreign Investment Law,
which Khan Canada and CAUC Holding raise directly.'** Second, the Claimants contend
that Article 10.7 of the ECT, which obliges the State to accord the covered investments
“treatment no less favourable” than that extended to domestic investors as well as other foreign
investors’ is substantially identical to Article 9 of the Foreign Investment Law, which requires
Mongolia to accord foreign investors “favorable conditions not less than those accorded to

Mongolian investors.”'*° The Claimants submit that the duty of loyalty'"'

and the duty of good
faith'? under Mongolian law provide for the same treatment. Third, the Claimants argue that
the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 10.1 of the ECT" is also provided for under
Mongolian law in the form of the duties of good faith'* and loyalty.'** Fourth, the Claimants
argue that the guarantee in Article 10.1 of the ECT against the impairment of qualifying
investments via unreasonable or discriminatory measures'“° expresses the negative aspect of the

7

fair and equitable treatment obligation,'*” and has an effect equivalent to Article 8.1 of the

Foreign Investment Law, which guarantees foreign investments “legal protection guaranteed by
the Constitution, this law and other legislation, consistent with those laws and [Mongolian]
international treaties.”'** Lastly, the Claimants contend that the guarantee in the ECT that
covered investments be accorded treatment no less favourable than that required by

international law'”’ obliges the State to comply with the international minimum standard,'*° a

in Article 10.12 of the ECT that the domestic law of the State provide effective means for the

assertion of claims and the enforcement of rights related to the covered investments
subsumed under the guarantee against the denial of justice,'** and forms part of the international

minimum standard.'**

The failure by Mongolia to abide by the sovereign i it assumed _under_the

A will amount to a breach of the civil obligations it owes its joint venture partners.

112. The Claimants submit that Mongolian law allows the State to participate in civil legal relations

and thereby be bound by Mongolian civil law.'** The Minerals Law of 1 January 1995 (“1995
Minerals Law”), which governs the Minerals Agreement, authorizes the State to both license
the right to mine mineral deposits and invest in mineral mining.'*° As Mongolia undertook the
latter activity through its execution of the Founding Agreement and its participation in the
CAUC joint venture, a civil relationship was created between the State and its partners in

CAUC,'*’ making Mongolia a participant in a civil legal relationship.'**

113. In the context of this civil relationship, Mongolia assumed sovereign commitments in the

a

161

Agreements’

pursuant to Article 12 of the 1995 Minerals Law, which authorizes the
Government to determine the terms applicable to State participation in a mining venture.’
Because the obligations assumed by the State in the Agreements conform to the relevant
Mongolian legislation, the Claimants contend that they are valid and enforceable.'*' In practical
terms, this means that, for matters specifically regulated by the Agreements, the terms of the
Agreements prevail over generally applicable public law (save the Constitution); whereas for
matters not specifically regulated by the Agreements but nonetheless connected to their subject
matter, Mongolia is bound by the civil duties of good faith and loyalty not to frustrate the

underlying purpose of the Agreements, inasmuch as the civil obligation of the State exists

102 This means, therefore, that the

alongside the laws governing its administrative conduct.
failure by Mongolia to abide by its sovereign commitments under the Agreements will amount

to a breach of the civil obligations it owes its joint venture partners.'®*

114. The Claimants reject the Respondents’ argument that actions taken by Mongolia in its
sovereign capacity somehow shield Mongolia from civil liability. They contend that civil
obligations are defined not by the capacity in which an obligor performs an obligation but by
the subject-matter of the obligation, its voluntary assumption and performance, the parity
between the parties in the contractual setting, and the legal protection of the rights of each party

to demand performance from the other.’

115. Relatedly, in response to the Respondents’ argument that the 2002 Civil Code does not apply to
the Agreements because they create a relationship of administrative subordination, the
Claimants contend that Mongolia does not automatically become a party to a “relationship

165 As previously

based on administrative subordination” upon its exercise of sovereign powers.
stated, the Claimants clarify that the relationship between the parties to the Agreements does
not depend on the use of governmental powers, but, rather, on the voluntary assumption by the

Government of civil commitments that entail the use of sovereign powers.’

The Mining and Exploration Licenses are property under Mongolian law.

116. The Claimants reject the Respondents’ corollary argument that the alleged non-application of
the 2002 Civil Code to relationships of administrative subordination means that the Mining and
Exploration Licenses are not property. They also reject the Respondents’ argument that the
licenses cannot be transferred or pledged freely and are not, therefore, property. As a
preliminary matter, the Claimants stress that, were this not the case, the current Minerals Law
would not require the State to compensate the holder of a minerals license who is impeded in its
ability to carry out its authorized exploration or mining activities by the State’s establishment of

a special protected area.'*”

117. As regards the specific issue of whether the licenses can be transferred or pledged, the

Claimants note that Article 49 of the 2006 Minerals Law allows minerals licenses to be

obligation is dependent on (i) whether the obligation properly overrode the applicable public law; (ii) if

public law was applicable, whether it permitted an alternative action less prejudicial to the Agreements; and

(iii) if it did not, whether the application of the public law was proper and equitable. Memorial, #4 205-206,

transferred and Articles 51 and 52 of the 2006 Minerals Law contemplate the pledging of these
licenses.'** The Claimants also reject the Respondents’ reliance on the Mongolian Supreme
Court decision in Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom as evidence that minerals licenses cannot
be pledged; they clarify that this decision dealt with the applicability of the 2002 Civil Code
provisions on tangible property to the pledging of mineral licenses, but said nothing about
whether rights conferred under licenses could constitute intangible property for the license-

holder.’

Administrative law is relevant to the Claimants’ claims under Mongolian and international law.

118. While acknowledging that the arbitration clauses in the Founding Agreement and the ECT

preclude claims based on Mongolian administrative law per se, the Claimants nevertheless
contend that Mongolian administrative law forms the factual predicate for their claims under
Mongolian civil law and international law.'” The Claimants also contend that the issue of
whether Mongolia has properly applied its administrative law is relevant to the resolution of the
claims brought under the ECT, which requires the State to apply its laws fairly, transparently

and in accordance with due process of law,!”!

and to the claims brought under the Foreign
Investment Law, which requires the State to properly apply its laws relating to foreign

investment and to follow due process of law.'”

International law is relevant to the interpretation and application of the Founding Agreement.

119. As regards the claims brought by Khan Canada and CAUC Holding, the Claimants submit that

168

169

the parties to the Founding Agreement must be deemed to have consented to the application of
international law given the broad wording of the arbitration agreement in Article 12, that the
Minerals Agreement is an international investment agreement and that international public
policy requires the application of international principles.'” In response to the Respondents’

Claimants clarify that their claims concern the illegal interference with their contractual rights

176

under the Agreements,'”° which are valid legal entitlements under Mongolian law!” and subject

to protection under international law as property rights.'*

120. The Claimants contend that the claims brought by Khan Netherlands must be resolved
according to international law, in accordance with the ECT and customs and principles of
international law, and note that international law should also serve gap-filling and interpretative

functions.'”
The Respondents’ position

121. The Respondents emphasize the difference between the legal standards applicable to the claims
of Khan Canada and CAUC Holding, on the one hand, and the claims of Khan Netherlands, on

the other hand. They also reject the view that Mongolian law and international law are similar.
The Foreign Investment Law and the ECT do not have similar effect.

122. As regards the Claimants’ claims for breaches of Mongolian law, the Respondents contend that
the effects of the relevant Foreign Investment Law provisions are different from the
corresponding ECT provisions, primarily because a Mongolian court would interpret the
provisions of the Foreign Investment Law in the context of the Mongolian legal system.'*” The
Respondents further contend that the Tribunal’s interpretation and application of Mongolian
law should not be conducted in light of “general principles of international law” but should,

rather, accord to how domestic law would be interpreted and applied in Mongolia.'*'

The Mining and Exploration Licenses do not constitute “property” under the 2002 Civil Code
and Mongolian law.

123. The Respondents clarify that the 2002 Civil Code, which is the source of the obligation of good
faith, and the Company Law, which is the source of the duty of loyalty, do not apply to actions

182

of the State taken in the exercise of its sovereign authority.’ Specifically, the Respondents

argue that Article 1.2 of the Civil Code of Mongolia, 1994 and Article 1.3 of the 2002 Civil
Code exclude the application of this Code to relationships based on administrative

subordination, such as the one in the present case, where Mongolia suspended and terminated

the licenses in the exercise of its administrative power.'** Mining licenses, moreover, create
precisely this kind of relationship between the Government and the license-holders.'** And
secondly, the Respondents contend that the 2002 Civil Code establishes a special regime with
respect to the transfer of ownership and pledge, while mining and exploration licenses cannot

be freely pledged or transferred.'*°

124. The Respondents refer to the decision of the Mongolian Supreme Court in Gobi Shoo LLC v.

Mongolrudprom which states that “a mining license, however, is possessed but not owned by
any entity, and therefore there is no legal ground to consider such mining license to be a

property right which is transferable to the ownership of others.”'**

 

The 2002 Civil Code is of limited relevance to the Claimants’ claims, as are the A

themselves.

125. The Respondents argue that the 2002 Civil Code does not apply to matters that are not

186

193

specifically regulated by the Agreements, although it is otherwise applicable to them.'*’ Matters
external to the Agreements include the protection of the environment and the termination and

suspension of licenses.'**

Moreover, the Respondents contend that the relevance of the
Agreements itself to the Claimants’ claims is limited because the invalidation of the Mining and
Exploration Licenses are not regulated by the Agreement, and are, therefore, governed by
Mongolian law.'*? The Respondents reject the Claimants’ contention that the terms of the
Agreements can override generally applicable public law,'” citing three reasons: (i)
Article 12.2 of the Minerals Agreement provides for the participation of the Government in the
mining operation not in its sovereign capacity but in its civil capacity, which means that
Mongolia is free to enact legislation affecting the Agreements;'®' (ii) the Agreements explicitly
refer to the application of Mongolian law;'” and (iii) Mongolian law does not authorize the

terms of the Agreements to override inconsistent public law.'**

126. The Respondents also argue that Erdene was not authorized to make “sovereign promises” in

the Founding Agreement, which means that such “sovereign promises” (if found to exist, which

The Mining and Exploration Licenses were terminated pursuant to ative law, over

Agreement, the Respondents submit that the claims brought by Khan Canada and CAUC

Holding under the Founding Agreement are limited to customary international law.

Mongolian law is relevant to Khan Netherlands’ claims under the ECT.

129. While acknowledging that international law applies to Khan Netherlands’ claims under the

ECT, the Respondents contend that Mongolian law also applies to these claims.'*” They
contend that international law mandates a renvoi to domestic law for the determination of the
scope of the relevant investment.'”* In this case, this means that Mongolian law determines
issues related to the registration, suspension, invalidation and re-registration of the Mining and
Exploration Licenses under the ECT, inasmuch as these licenses were created under and are
subject to Mongolian law.'”” To hold otherwise would be to insulate the Claimants from the

requirement of complying with Mongolian law.”

THE ALLEGED UNITY OF INVESTMENTS

The Claimants’ position

130. While the Mineral License and the Exploration License can each be considered an investment

201

in its own right,” the Claimants submit that there really is only one investment at issue in this

case: “the mining and development of the Dornod Project, including principally Deposit No. 7,

202

by the CAUC joint venture.” The Claimants reason that “uranium could not be economically
mined and produced from Deposit No. 7 by virtue of the rights conferred under either of the
Licenses alone.”””* Accordingly, they contend that the impairment of rights conferred under
either license equates to a breach of the obligations owed to the holders of both Licenses — that

is, to all the Claimants.?”

131. First, the Claimants argue that the Agreements themselves envisage this unity of investment.

Thus, in the Minerals Agreement, Mongolia “guarantee[d] in compliance with the Mineral Law
of Mongolia [the] issuance of a license permitting development of [Deposit No. 2] and [Deposit
No. 7],” and “contribute[d] the right to utilize [Deposit No. 7]” to CAUC once the economic

viability of the deposit was shown.””

Consequently, the original Mining License covered the
entirety of Deposits Nos. 2 and 7, and was intended to continue to cover these deposits even
after its size was reduced at CAUC’s request in 1998. The Exploration License was acquired by
the Claimants only as a result of an inadvertent surveying error that excluded a segment of

Deposit No. 7 from the area of the Mining License.””

132. While they financed the acquisition of the Exploration License themselves, the Claimants stress

that their intention was always to use the Additional Property to benefit the Dornod Project as a
whole.” In this respect, the Claimants note that the Respondents contradict themselves when
they insist, on the one hand, that the Mining and Exploration Licenses are entirely unconnected
and, on the other hand, that Khan Canada had acquired the Exploration License for its own
benefit and at the expense of the joint venture.”’* The Claimants contend that all joint venture

partners were not only aware of the acquisition of the Exploration License but also openly

recognized and jointly acknowledged that the planned merger of the Exploration License with

the Mining License was necessary for the economic viability of the Dornod Project.2”

133. Second, the Claimants argue that Khan Canada had a right under the Agreements to the

reunification of the Mining and Exploration Licenses. Article 38.5 of the 1995 Minerals Law
(under which the Mineral License was issued) allows a mineral license holder to request
changes to the concession boundary in response to changes in the deposit size”"” and Article 40
of the Minerals Law of 5 June 1997 (“1997 Minerals Law”) (under which the Exploration
License was issued) allows a license holder to transfer the license.?!' The Claimants contend
that Mongolia’s duties of good faith and loyalty toward its partners in CAUC required
Mongolia to apply the minerals laws in furtherance of the purpose of the CAUC joint

venture."

134. Third, the Claimants allege that they attempted to convert the Exploration License into a

mining license in the fastest possible time.’!* When the Exploration License was invalidated by
the MRAM in August 2007 on the basis that Khan had not converted it into a mining license,”"*
Khan immediately wrote to the MRAM explaining that it was in the process of registering the
Dornod reserves, which was a prerequisite for the conversion of the Exploration License to a
mining license.’'> The Claimants allege that MRAM Chairman Luvsanvandan Bold clarified,
via a public statement on 10 September 2007, that the exploration licenses that had been
invalidated the previous month (including Khan’s) would remain valid, as long as their license-

holders converted them to mining licenses.’'®

Khan therefore submitted an application for
conversion on 14 September 2007.”” In a meeting with Khan representatives on 17 September
2007, Chairman Bold explained that the conversion of the Exploration License was being
delayed due to the designation of the Dornod deposit as “of strategic importance.””'* On
27 November 2007, the MRAM instructed Khan to wait until the Minerals Council had reached

a decision on the registration of the Dornod deposit reserves before attempting to convert the

Exploration License into a mining license.”"” The Claimants conclude by noting that Khan had
met all of the legal requirements to obtain mining rights over the Additional Property and that
“Mongolia later used these delays in its administrative process to justify its failure to ever

consider Khan’s application to convert the Exploration License to a mining license.””””

135. Finally, the Claimants submit that, when the NEA cancelled its Exploration License, Khan

Mongolia as the holder of an exploration license”! had a vested right to a mining license.”
The Claimants add that the MRAM has no discretion in considering applications for
conversion, as the 2006 Minerals Law both enumerates the requirements for obtaining a mining
license and lists all possible decisions on an application and their bases.”* They also note that,
because Khan Mongolia had met all the legal requirements to obtain mining rights over the
Additional Property, Khan was justified in its expectation that a mining license would be issued

for it?"

136. The Claimants clarify that they did not submit a written formal proposal for the merger of the

licenses and explain that “they would not logically have done so until the Government

99225

approved their application to convert the Exploration License into a mining license.

The Respondents’ position

137. The Respondents reject the Claimants’ argument regarding the alleged unity of the Mining and

Exploration Licenses, and submit that “it is an undisputable fact that no agreement [for the

reunification of the Mining and Exploration Licenses] was ever made or even proposed.”””°

138. The Respondents stress that the Additional Property was excluded from the scope of the Mining

License due to CAUC Holding’s own decision to reduce the Mining License area, and refer to

the confirmation of this decision in 2004 by the Administrative Court.’

139. Further, the Respondents contend that the Claimants sought to acquire the Exploration License

for their benefit alone. They argue that, even in the face of the Respondents’ requests for

not inform the SPC or Priargunsky of (i) the surveying error that allegedly led to the exclusion
of a segment of Deposit No. 7 from the Mining License area, (ii) the necessity of acquiring
mining rights over the excluded area in order to ensure the economic viability of CAUC or

(iii) the Claimants’ plan to acquire the Exploration License.”

140. Moreover, the Respondents argue, Khan Mongolia treated the Exploration License as separate

from the Mining License, and did not seek to have the two licenses merged.” To illustrate this
argument, the Respondents refer to the Claimants’ draft proposals for an updated joint venture
agreement that describe the area of the joint venture as the area covered by the Mining License,
without any reference to the Exploration License or the Additional Property’! The
Respondents note that there were no further draft proposals for an updated joint venture
agreement and, ultimately, no joint venture agreement.” They also refer to a publication by
Khan dated 4 February 2008 for the Toronto Stock Exchange that mentions the joint venture

only with regard to the Mining License, and not the Exploration License.”

141. The Respondents further argue that Khan required mining licenses over both the Main Property

and the Additional Property in order for the Dornod Project to be profitable, and stress that,
while Khan had a Mining License over the Main Property, it had only an Exploration License
over the Additional Property, which was in any event due to expire in February 2011.7" In
practical terms, this means that Khan would have had to first convert its Exploration License

into a mining license, before it could be merged with the existing Mining License.”

142. Yet, the Respondents submit, Khan was not entitled to the conversion of the Exploration

236

License into a mining license.~” Mongolian law does not grant the owner of an exploration

license the automatic right to convert that license into a mining license,’ but instead

conditions this conversion on the meeting of several requirements and the approval of the

238

Mongolian authorities.~” Khan’s 14 September 2007 application for the conversion of the

Exploration License into a mining license lacked certain requirements listed in Article 25 of the

2006 Minerals Law.”* Because the conversion of the Exploration License into a mining license

42%

was conditional and not guarantee the Respondents argue that the Exploration License

“represents the interest of Khan Mongolia, and should be assessed at face value.””*!

143. According to the Respondents, Khan also was not entitled to the merger of the Mining and

Exploration Licenses.” Mongolian law does not recognize the concept of unifying an
exploration license and a mining license, as the MRAM maintains discretion over the
consolidation of adjoining licenses.’ The merger of licenses is not addressed in the Minerals
Agreement either, and, therefore, “[t]he reduction of the area covered by the Mining License
held by CAUC entailed an equivalent reduction of the area covered by the Minerals
Agreement.” This is further supported by the fact that a “significant portion of the

Exploration License area is outside the boundaries of the original Mining License.””*°

THE JULY 2009 TEMPORARY SUSPENSION OF THE MINING LICENSE

The Claimants’ position

144. In line with their overall argument that Mongolia’s conduct leading up to the permanent

246

invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses was wrongful,” the Claimants submit that

the July 2009 temporary suspension of the Mining License by the MRAM was both an

improper act under Mongolian law™4’

and one of the pretexts for the eventual expropriation of
the Mining and Exploration Licenses.”“* Specifically, the Claimants contend that the enactment
of the NEL and the LPCNEL was connected to the temporary suspension of the Mining License

(see paragraph 173 below).

145. According to the Claimants, the violations of Mongolian law identified in the 2009 reports of

239

the SSIA did not justify the suspension of the Mining License.” The Claimants further contend

that the SSIA inspections themselves were politically motivated and intended to manufacture

violations on the part of the Claimants.”!

146. With respect to Khan’s alleged violation of Mongolian law through its failure to register the

Dornod mineral reserves in Mongolia while publishing information thereon on the Toronto
Stock Exchange, the Claimants submit that Khan Canada’s actions on the Toronto Stock
Exchange could not have violated Mongolian law, as Khan Canada was neither registered in

Mongolia nor subject to the jurisdiction of the SSIA.°*

147. Further, the Claimants argue that Mongolia was itself at fault for failing to register the Dornod

mineral reserves, as the sole responsibility of the license holder is to submit reserve estimates to
the competent authority, while the actual registering of the reserves falls to the State.** The
Claimants contend that they exerted all efforts to have the Dornod reserves registered by the

Minerals Council, but to no avail.” Specifically, while Khan submitted an application for the

255

registration of a re-estimate of the Dornod reserves on 29 August 2008,°° the relevant

authorities delayed reviewing this application for over a year.**° The Team of Experts that was

report and that the licenses were permanently invalidated on the basis of this non-registration.?°

149. With regard to the other alleged breaches of Mongolian law, the Claimants argue: that SSIA

266

and NEA inspectors had previously confirmed the safety of the drill core” and commended

Khan’s efforts to store it within the Yakhi Lake protected area;?*”

that Mongolia itself issued
the Exploration License without regard for the boundaries of the protected area and that, in any
case, any overlap between the Exploration License area and the protected area is speculative;?*
and that Khan complied with the Radiation Protection and Safety Law and was in regular

contact with the relevant agencies to ensure compliance with all applicable regulations.””

150. The Claimants specify that, in their letter to the SSIA of 22 April 2009 and during the meeting

with the SSIA of the same date, they did not admit to having committed the violations listed in
the 2009 SSIA inspection reports, but merely acknowledged the SSIA’s opinion with regard to
these alleged breaches of Mongolian law and expressed their willingness to cooperate with the
SSIA and other relevant authorities.”” They emphasize that all of the breaches or observed

improprieties referred to in the SSIA reports were remedied.””!

151. The Claimants note that the MRAM’s Suspension Notice refers to Article 13.2 of the State

262

Inspection Law and Articles 13.1 and 13.2 of the Licensing Law,’” and argue that the former
3

provision is irrelevant to license suspensions,”” while the latter designates as the relevant

inspection body not the SSIA, but the MRAM.” According to the Claimants, the MRAM
would not have needed to investigate any alleged failure by CAUC to register the Dornod

reserves when the license was suspended, since “it had been in regular contact with the

275

company over the previous ten months about that very issue.”*’” The Claimants contend that the

MRAM nevertheless “blindly relied” on the July 2009 SSIA Report in issuing its Suspension
Notice, as demonstrated by the fact that both the report and the notices were issued on the same

276

day.

152. The Claimants add that they saw the April 2009 SSIA Report for the first time when the

7

Respondents produced it in this arbitration,”’ and note that it is not signed by the SSIA

inspectors nor representatives of either CAUC or Khan Mongolia.?**

153. The Claimants lastly allege that they provided Mongolia with data and repeatedly requested

meetings with the relevant officials in order to address concerns raised by the 2009 SSIA

inspection,”” but that their requests were ignored or rebuffed by Mongolia.”

The Respondents’ position

154. The Respondents submit that the July 2009 suspension of the Mining License cannot amount to

an expropriation, as it was a three-month suspension that, therefore, does not meet the

281

expropriation requirement that the measure be permanent.” Nor can Mongolia’s failure to

register the Dornod reserves amount to an interference with property rights.”

The Respondents
argue that being unable to claim that the non-registration of the Dornod reserves and the
suspension of the Mining License amount to an expropriation, the Claimants are constrained to
characterize these acts as mere instances of the “entire chain of illegal administrative actions

that ultimately resulted in the expropriation of Claimants’ investment.””*?

155. The Respondents further submit that the suspension of the Mining License was proper under

Mongolian law, as it was motivated by the breaches of Mongolian law uncovered during the
SSIA’s inspection of the Dornod site in April 2009 and summarized in the April 2009 SSIA
Report and July 2009 SSIA Report.“

156. The Respondents also defend the legitimacy of the SSIA’s inspections. They dismiss the

Claimants’ argument that these inspections were brief and instead stress that such inspections

285

lasted up to a week;~” refer to the testimony of Mr. Munkhtamir, a senior SSIA inspector, who

explained that the inspections were not politically motivated and that the inspectors had acted

impartially;** and note that Ms. Davis, on whose testimony the Claimants rely for their
argument that the inspections were atypical, was not present during either the 2009 or 2010

inspections.°*”

157. The Respondents argue that, most importantly, the Claimants violated Article 45 of the Subsoil

Law*** and Articles 25.1.5, 48.3 and 48.4 of the 2006 Minerals Law when they published
information about the Dornod mineral reserves on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 2006,
without first registering them in the State Integrated Registry or otherwise sharing information
about them with either Mongolia or their partners in CAUC.”” The Respondents state that “it is
ironic” for the Claimants to argue in this arbitration that Mongolia should be held liable for not
registering Khan’s reserves, given that, by 2008, when Khan finally made its application for the
registration of the Dornod reserves, it had already been in breach of Mongolian law for two

years and that this application, therefore, was belated.”

158. The Respondents add that, with respect to Khan’s 2008 application, Mongolia followed

standard procedure. It appointed a Team of Experts,”' which identified deficiencies and
insufficiencies in Khan’s application materials” and noted that the application contained little
input from Khan, being based largely on data provided by Priargunsky.”*

159. While Khan’s application was being considered, the NEL, on the basis of which the NEA

285

286

decided not to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses, took effect, making any
decision on Khan’s application for the registration of the Dornod reserves unnecessary." In

other words, “this process of registering the reserves became moot at that time as the [Mining

and Exploration] Licenses had to be re-registered under the new applicable regime.””**

According to the Respondents, this meant that neither the Team of Experts nor the Minerals

Council ever reviewed the accuracy of the updated reserve report.?°°

160. The Respondents further argue that the Claimants were in breach of: (i) Article 19.2.3 of the

2006 Minerals Law, due to an overlap between the Exploration License area and the protected
Yakhi Lake reserve, (ii) Article 33.1 of the Law on Special Protected Areas, due to the storage
of radioactive materials in the protected Yakhi Lake reserve,” (iii) Article 5.4 of the 2006
Minerals Law, due to a failure to “enter into a mining agreement with the MRAM,” and (iv)
the Radiation Protection and Safety Law, despite having been previously notified of this
violation during the SSIA inspections of 2005 and 2006.°**

161. According to the Respondents, Khan itself admitted to having committed these breaches of

Mongolian law, both in a letter to the SSIA dated 22 April 2009 and at a meeting with the SSIA
of the same date during which Mr. Erdenebileg (representing CAUC) agreed to remedy these

breaches.””

162. The Respondents also contend that the Suspension Notice issued by the MRAM complied with

Articles 13.1 and 13.3 of the Licensing Law, which allow the three-month suspension of a
license based on the evaluation of a specialized inspection authority” They note that, in
reaching its decision, the MRAM did not “blindly” rely on the conclusions of the SSIA, but
rather had “ample” time to consider its findings, since three months elapsed between the
submission of the April 2009 SSIA report to the MRAM and the issuance of the Suspension
Notice in July 2009." As for Article 13.2 of the State Inspection Law, it was cited in the
Suspension Notice because it relates to the obligation of business entities to remedy their

violations of the law.

163. In response to the Claimants’ allegation that the April 2009 SSIA Report was never provided to

CAUC, the Respondents note that the results of the SSIA inspection were discussed during the
meeting of 22 April 2009, which was attended by representatives of both CAUC and Khan

opportunity to present its position.**

THE NEL, THE LPCNEL AND THE INVALIDATION OF THE MINING AND EXPLORATION
LICENSES

The Claimants’ position

164. The Claimants submit that the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL confirmed Mongolia’s

intention to expropriate the Claimants’ rights under the Mining and Exploration Licenses and

the Agreements,**°

while the expropriation was consummated by the subsequent invalidation of
the Mining and Exploration Licenses through the NEA’s issuance of the Permanent

Invalidation Notices and its subsequent refusal to re-register the licenses.*””

(i) The Enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL

165. The Claimants submit that the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL confirmed Mongolia’s

expropriatory intent because, had these laws been properly applied (which they were not), they
would have infringed the Claimants’ rights in the Mining and Exploration Licenses and the

Agreements.

166. The Claimants highlight three problematic features of the NEL and the LPCNEL. First,

Article 5.2 of the NEL required Mongolia to take ownership of “no less than 51 percent of stake
in the joint company, where exploration and determination of [uranium] reserve have been
conducted with state budget.”*** Second, the LPCNEL provided for the retroactive application

of the NEL by giving the NEA significant discretion*”

to reject re-registration applications on
the basis of violations of the NEL and providing that licenses that were not re-registered would
be revoked.*!” Third, uranium licenses issued under the NEL would grant license holders

limited rights as compared to uranium licenses previously issued in Mongolia.*"!

167. The Claimants submit that the proper application of these features of the NEL and the LPCNEL

to CAUC and Khan Mongolia would have effectively neutralized their property rights in the
Mining and Exploration Licenses, because it could have led to the permanent invalidation of
the Licenses based on the breach of requirements found in the NEL, an entirely new law, and
because, had the licenses been re-issued under the NEL, they would nevertheless have granted
CAUC and Khan Mongolia less favourable rights than did the Mining and Exploration CAUC

and Khan Mongolia less favourable rights than did the Mining and Exploration Licenses.*'”

168. Thus, the proper application of the NEL and the LPCNEL to CAUC and Khan Mongolia would

have amounted to an expropriation of the Claimants’ property rights in the Mining and

°? in violation

Exploration Licenses and their shareholding rights in CAUC and Khan Mongolia’
of Article 13 of the ECT, Mongolian rules on property protection, as reflected in Article 8.2 of
the Foreign Investment Law and the Constitution, and the international minimum standard for

the treatment of aliens.*'*

169. In support, the Claimants submit that “it is widely recognized that a State’s general legislative

measures are expropriatory where: (i) they are arbitrary, discriminatory, disproportionate or

otherwise unfair; and (ii) they result in the effective neutralization of the foreign investor’s

property rights”*!* through the investor’s loss of control over the investment.*'®

170. The Claimants argue that, in the present case, the application of the NEL and the LPCNEL to

CAUC and Khan Mongolia would have been disproportionate, as these laws serve no

of the radioactive minerals industry in an environmentally friendly way*'* and the

encouragement of foreign investment,” the Claimants contend that most actual NEL

provisions in fact concern the State ownership and licensing requirements.**” The Claimants

characterize the NEL’s State ownership requirement, in particular, as an authorization of the

“naked confiscation of property rights,”””’ and stress that the Respondents failed to identify the

171. The Claimants further argue that, even if the NEL served some legitimate public purpose

(which is denied), its retroactive application to license holders could not be justified as its

policy goals could be achieved through less onerous means.”

172. The Claimants add that the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL was arbitrary and irrational,

as it was undertaken without input from stakeholders and passed only two weeks before the
Mongolian national summer holiday.*”* In particular, the Claimants allege that the earlier draft
of the NEL that had been circulated to Khan representatives did not contain the provisions on

State ownership and licensing,””* which were “shoe-horned” into it.°

173. Lastly, the Claimants contend that the bad faith and discriminatory intent underlying the

enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL is supported by: (i) the fact that CAUC was the only
company holding a mining license for radioactive minerals at the time these laws were enacted;
(ii) the opposition of Mr. Enkhbat — the head of the NEA and its “reputed architect” — to Khan’s
involvement in the Dornod Project; and (iii) the temporary suspension of the Mining License a
mere six days prior to the enactment of these laws.’ The Claimants also contend that the
LPCNEL was targeted at two foreign companies, namely Khan and Western Prospector Group
Ltd. (“Western Prospector”).”* The Claimants also note that the Mongolian Prime Minister
controlled both the NEA, which was created by the NEL, and the SSIA2”? As regards the
connection to the SSIA, “the agency that had first fabricated allegations against Khan,” the
Claimants allege that the MRAM was unable to lift the suspension of the Mining License due to
the SSIA’s failure to respond to the MRAM’s queries about Khan’s alleged violations of

. 3
Mongolian law.**°

Foreign Investment Law.**! According to the Claimants, such principles are violated “when
application of a new public law completely invalidates a prior right without compensation,”
even if such principles would not generally be violated by non-discriminatory public laws that
affect property rights but do not go so far as “to detract from the[ir] essence.”**? Here, the
application of the LPCNEL would lead to the invalidation of a prior right without compensation
in that this law “effectively requires the license holders to apply to obtain new rights, which are

constituted under a completely different set of terms and conditions than the original ones.” **3

175. In addition, the Claimants submit that the retroactive application of the NEA and the LPCNEL

would have violated Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement. According to the Claimants,
Article 3.6. of the Founding Agreement, which provides that the “[p]roperty of the Company
will not be the subject of requisition or confiscation,” allows Mongolia to confiscate CAUC

3 thus

property on the basis solely of the Constitution, and not generally applicable law,
offering broader protection than Article 13 of the ECT, Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment
Law and Article 16.3 of the Constitution.*** The Constitution allows expropriation only if the
license rights are used to the detriment of the population’s health, environmental interests or

336 Which is not the case here.**” The Claimants emphasize that, due to the

national security,
restrictive phrasing of Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement, even if the NEL and the
LPCNEL were based on public policy (which is denied), their application to CAUC would

nevertheless be in violation of this provision.**

176. The Claimants also submit that the application of the NEL and the LPCNEL to CAUC and

Khan Mongolia would have violated Mongolia’s duty of good faith (as set out in Article 13 of
the 2002 Civil Code) and duty of loyalty (as set out in Article 83 of the Company Law) to its
partners in the CAUC joint venture. In applying the NEL and the LPCNEL, Mongolia would
effectively have used its sovereign power not in the best interest of CAUC, but rather to obtain

a favourable commercial position vis-a-vis its partners in the joint venture.

177. The Claimants further submit that, not only would the application of the NEL and the LPCNEL

to CAUC and Khan Mongolia have violated Mongolia’s obligations under the Agreements as a

matter of Mongolian law, but such illegal interference with the Claimants’ contractual rights

would also have constituted a violation of international law.” The Claimants contend that a
State can be held internationally liable when it enacts legislation that infringes a foreign
investor’s rights that rest on a contract with the State into which the State has entered as “a

«on as i 3.
Sovereign,” as is the case here. 40

(ii) The Invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses

178. While taking issue with the content of the NEA and the LPCNEL, the Claimants note that these

laws were not properly applied to them." Nonetheless, the measures taken by Mongolia — in

 

particular, the NEA’s issuance of the Permanent Invalidation Notices and its subsequent refusal
to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses under the NEL — realized Mongolia’s
intention to expropriate the Claimants’ rights under the licenses and the Agreements.
Specifically, Mongolia’s invalidation of and refusal to reinstate the Mining and Exploration
Licenses resulted in a total deprivation of these license rights, which, in turn, deprived Khan
Resources of its contractual rights under the Agreements to participate in the production of

uranium from the Dornod deposits.*”

179. With regard to the improper application of the NEL and the LPCNEL, the Claimants submit

that while the LPCNEL provided for the revocation of licenses that failed to be re-registered
after the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL, it did not authorize the invalidation of
licenses before the re-registration deadline of 15 November 2009.2 Yet on 8 October 2009, the
NEA issued Order No. 141, revoking all uranium licenses in Mongolia, and the Temporary
Invalidation Notices, confirming the effect of Order No. 120 on the Temporary Procedure on
Re-Registration and Re-Issuance of the License for Radioactive Minerals (“Order No.

120”) 2"

180. As regards the Respondents’ contention that Order No. 141 only had temporary effect and

therefore could not amount to a permanent invalidation, the Claimants submit that this

temporary measure was in fact given permanent effect by subsequent actions.

181. In addition, the Claimants note that the Respondents did not follow the terms of Order No. 141

the Claimants stress that Order No. 141 was a temporary suspension whose terms required the

re-registration of licenses pursuant to Order No. 120.“

182. As for the NEA’s notices of 15 December 2010, the Claimants argue that the Notices did not

constitute a decision not to re-register the licenses made in application of the NEL, as the
Respondents now allege, and note that the Claimants did not in fact receive any decision on
their applications for re-registration.“’ The Claimants stress that “there is actually no valid
decision by an authorized agent of the Government of Mongolia anywhere in the record of this
case that could justify the permanent invalidation of the licenses.”*“* The Claimants submit that
the procedure for consideration of license re-registration applications under the NEL was set
out in Order No. 120°” and point out that, rather than referring to the NEL, Order No. 141. or
Order No. 120, the 15 December 2010 notices mention only the alleged violations of
Mongolian law identified in the April 2009 SSIA Report, a requirement that may be taken to
fall under the NEL but that only applies to licenses already issued under that law.**’ In other
words, the Claimants stress, the provision under the NEL on repeated violations of Mongolian
law deals not with the re-registration of licenses under the NEL but with the invalidation of
licenses already registered therein.**' It is with this argument that the Claimants address the

Licenses was justified by Article 26.1 of the NEL.**

183. The Claimants note that Letter No. 8/1033 from the NEA, on which they claim the Respondents

applied to have their licenses re-registered, in that the two licenses of CAUC and Khan
Mongolia were, out of 165 other licenses, invalidated without the issuance of a decision on re-
registration, while the other licenses were not re-registered on account of their failure to submit

an application for re-registration? The Claimants further note that the applications for re-

registration that were submitted by other license-holders resulted in the re-registration of these

licenses within a matter of days.*™

184. The Claimants argue, therefore, that the Permanent Invalidation Notices were intended to

“invalidate the Mining and Exploration Licenses once and for all, no matter how frivolous the
basis.”**° According to the Claimants, this intention is made apparent by: (i) the content of the
Temporary Invalidation Notices, which did not mention any violations of Mongolian law, (ii)
the annulment of the effect of the 2009 SSIA reports via the January 2010 settlement agreement
between CAUC and the MRAM, and (iii) the fact that the allegations of breaches of Mongolian
law found in the 2009 SSIA reports were baseless (see paragraph 78 above).’*° The Claimants
also point to official statements made by Government officials during this time, which they
allege indicate that the fate of the licenses had already been decided during the pendency of the

relevant administrative and judicial proceedings.*”

185. The legal standards which, according to the Claimants, the Respondents breached in

permanently invalidating the Mining and Exploration Licenses, are detailed below.

(iii) Expropriation and Other Violations Relating to Property

186. The Claimants first contend that, in permanently invalidating the Mining and Exploration

354
355

356

Licenses, Mongolia breached Article 13 of the ECT, as well as the customary international law
principle that prohibits expropriation without compensation.** First, the Claimants contend that
the Mining and Exploration Licenses do constitute property. Second, the invalidation of the
Mining and Exploration Licenses neutralized the Claimants’ investment in the Dornod
Project.* Third, the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses was carried out
without due process of law or payment of compensation, and was not based on any legitimate
public interest” Fourth, the issuance of the Permanent Invalidation Notices was arbitrary, as
the decision-making process of the agency was based not on fact but prejudice.**' Fifth, the
invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses was discriminatory, because the licenses
of other business entities that complied with the NEL were reissued, while there is no basis to

find that CAUC and Khan Mongolia did not comply with the NEL*” and as CAUC and Khan

Mongolia’s license applications were more thorough than those of other companies.*** Because
the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses was the outcome of a campaign of
conduct that aimed at depriving the Claimants of their participation in the Dornod Project, in
order to make way for the Mongolian-Russian joint venture, the Claimants contend that this

case is one of direct expropriation in violation of Article 13 of the ECT.**

187. Moreover, in reliance on the confirmation by the Mongolian administrative courts of the

illegality of the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses (discussed in Part V(D)
below), the Claimants contend that the NEA’s issuance of the Permanent Invalidation Notices
violated the constitutional principles of property protection as reflected in Articles 8.2 and 8.3
of the Foreign Investment Law.*®* The Claimants argue that the Government must follow due
process of law when invalidating property rights (even when such invalidation is legally
permissible), which the administrative courts found that Mongolia did not do in the present
case.*°° The Claimants stress that the Tribunal should accept this finding of the Mongolian
courts.” Specifically, the Claimants contend that Mongolia’s permanent invalidation of and
refusal to reinstate the Mining and Exploration Licenses amounted to a khuraakh, or a
deprivation of property that is carried out as a penalty for breaches of law and not accompanied
by compensation, which is prohibited by Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment Law as well as
Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement.** This is especially in view of how the permanent
invalidation of the licenses was not in accordance with the legal procedures for the
implementation of the NEL“ The Claimants also note that the Respondents have not proven
that Mongolia’s permanent invalidation of the licenses could be considered a daichlakh as in
Article 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law, that is, an action that was necessary to protect an

urgent public interest and is accompanied by compensation.*”°

188. The Claimants further submit that the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses

363

364

369
370

violated Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement, which prohibited Mongolia from confiscating
CAUC’s property unless required by the Constitution, as would have been the case if CAUC
had used its license rights to harm population health, the environment, or national security (see

paragraph 175 above). The Claimants argue that, in the present case, CAUC did no such thing,

as the NEA based the Permanent Invalidation Notices primarily on baseless allegations of

violations of Mongolian law.

The Claimants also contend that Erdene could and did make a sovereign promise not to
confiscate in Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement. The Claimants refer to the Jurisdictional
Award to argue that Erdene (predecessor of MonAtom) undertook obligations in both the
Founding Agreement and the Minerals Agreement that only a sovereign state could fulfil. The
Claimants also explain that State-owned entities operate on behalf of the State, which means
that Mongolia, through Erdene, could make the sovereign promise not to confiscate the
property of the joint venture. As regards Article 12.3 of the 1995 Minerals Law, on which basis
the Founding Agreement was entered, the Claimants interpret this provision to mean that a
State, as a commercial participant in a mining venture, will participate on an equal basis with
other business partners and shall be subject to civil liability if it fails to meet its commercial
commitments. According to the Claimants, therefore, Mongolia’s failure to abide by its
sovereign commitment as contained in Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement amounts to a
breach of the civil obligation owed to its joint venture partners, thereby triggering civil liability

on its part (see paragraphs 112-115 above).

(iv) Violation of Standards for the Treatment of the Claimants and their Investment

The Claimants submit that Mongolia’s permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration

Licenses violated rules for the treatment of the Claimants and their investments.

First, the Claimants submit that the permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration
Licenses violated Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law, which requires investments to be
afforded the “legal protection guaranteed by the Constitution, this law and other legislation,

consistent with those laws and international treaties to which Mongolia is a party.”*”"

Second, the Claimants submit that the permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration
Licenses violated Mongolia’s obligation under Article 10.1 of the ECT to accord Khan
Netherlands’ investment treatment no less favourable than that required by international law.
According to the Claimants, the invalidation of the licenses was arbitrary, undertaken without

the benefit of a rational decision-making process, and motivated by overt prejudice.*”*

Third, the Claimants contend that the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses
breached Mongolia’s obligation under Article 10.1 to provide the investments of Khan

Netherlands with fair and equitable treatment, in that Mongolia used its sovereign authority to

benefit itself at the expense of the Claimants, rather than honouring its obligations under the
Agreements.*” The Claimants reject the contention that they cannot claim protection for what
the Respondents characterize as an imprudent investment’™ by referring to the specific
assurances made by Mongolia in its international investment agreement with the Claimants —

the Minerals Agreement.’”*

194. Fourth, the Claimants submit that Mongolia violated its commitments under Article 9 of the

Foreign Investment Law and Article 10.7 of the ECT to accord the relevant investors (all of the
Claimants under the Foreign Investment Law, and Khan Netherlands under the ECT) treatment
no less favourable than that accorded to Mongolian investors and their investments, because of
the prima facie evidence that the NEA re-registered the radioactive minerals licenses of many
other companies, despite Khan being in a better position to meet the legal requirements for the

re-registration.

195. Fifth, the Claimants submit that Mongolia’s breach of Articles 8.1 and 9 of the Foreign

Investment Law also constitutes a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, as this provision states

that the host State shall “observe any obligations it has entered into” with an investor.

196. Finally, the Claimants submit that Mongolia violated its obligations under the Agreements and

Article 81.2 of the Company Law by failing to act in good faith towards its joint venture
partners and in the best interests of CAUC. The Claimants further contend that, in light of its
duty of loyalty, Mongolia was in fact obligated to use its sovereign powers to further the

interests of the CAUC joint venture.

The Respondents’ position

197. The Respondents contend that neither the enactment of the NEL and the LPCNEL nor the

permanent invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses breached any obligations owed
by the Respondents to the Claimants or were enacted to target the Claimants specifically.
Arguing that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated through the proper
application of the NEL and the LPCNEL, the Respondents do not differentiate (as do the

Claimants) between the effects of the potential and actual application of these laws.

198. The Respondents submit that Mongolia enacted the NEL and the LPCNEL in an exercise of its

sovereignty in the uranium industry, which was both potentially profitable and potentially

detrimental to the environment.*” The Respondents contend that the application of the NEL
served the public purpose of providing a comprehensive regulatory regime for the exploitation
of radioactive materials and nuclear energy in a manner that adhered to both national and

international standards and that ultimately protected human health and the environment.”

199. The Respondents argue that the NEL was passed in a transparent manner, given that: the

International Atomic Energy Agency (“IAEA”) assisted in its drafting;*”* drafts were
transmitted to Khan;*” and a draft was published in the May 2009 edition of the Mongolian

Mining Journal. **°

200. The Respondents explain that the NEL and the LPCNEL required all uranium mining or

exploration licenses to be re-registered.**' By Order No. 141, the NEA ordered all such licenses
to be invalidated in October 2009, pending their re-registration; in the Temporary Invalidation
Notices, the NEA requested CAUC and Khan Mongolia to suspend the relevant activity

pending re-registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.’

201. The Respondents characterize Order No. 141 as “a general measure which applied to all

radioactive minerals mining and exploration license holders” and note that it provided the
necessary guidance for the implementation of the LPCNEL.** The Respondents highlight that
the validity of the decree was confirmed in the 13 October 2009 decision of the Administrative
Appellate Court (see Part V(D) below), and stress that the Tribunal should not second-guess the

decisions of Mongolian administrative courts.***

202. The Respondents reject the emphasis placed by the Claimants on the allegedly “retroactive”

376

386

application of the NEL, and clarify that “[t]he NEL applied to existing license holders but
applied to their activities prospectively.”*** The Respondents note that the real question is
whether this regulatory change breached any obligation that the Respondents owed the

Claimants, and contend that this question should be answered in the negative.**°

203. Among the features of the NEL that are relevant to license-holders are the following: (i) the

obligation to comply with the general requirements set out in Article 16.3, such as the

requirement to abide by Mongolian legislation and relevant standards and to use technology

387

that is not harmful to human health and the environment;””’ (ii) the NEA’s discretion in view of

Article 16.3.1 to base its decision on the re-registration of licenses partly on an applicant’s

history of compliance with Mongolian law; (iii) the license-holder’s obligation to comply

with the conditions specified in Article 17.2, as applicable to licenses for exploring for

radioactive materials; and (iv) the obligation to comply with the conditions specified in

Article 17.3, as applicable to the license for exploiting radioactive materials.*””

204. The Respondents highlight that the Claimants are challenging provisions of the NEL that never

applied to them, such as the State ownership requirement of Article 5.°”'

205. The Respondents allege that the implementation of the NEL triggered a further SSIA

inspection,’ which revealed that the breaches identified in the April 2009 SSIA Inspection

Report had not yet been remedied.*”*

Because the NEL requires license-holders to comply with
Mongolian law, the Respondents note that the results of the SSIA inspection required the NEA
to confirm the decision not to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses.*** The
Respondents also highlight the SSIA Inspections of 2005, 2006, 2009 and 2010, all of which
had found that the Claimants had breached Mongolian law on several occasions.” The
Respondents allege that the NEA’s notices nos. 4/1401 and 4/1402 issued on 15 December
2010 clearly stated that the Mining and Exploration Licenses could not be re-registered because
CAUC and Khan Mongolia had not satisfied the requirements of the NEL*”* and that these
notices also recalled the administrative process regarding the re-registration of the licenses
under the NEL.*”’ The Respondents also note, specifically, that these notifications indicated
that the Mining and Exploration Licenses could not be re-registered because of the repeated
breaches by CAUC and Khan Mongolia of Mongolian law.*”* The Respondents further contend
that the decision of the NEA complied with Articles 26.1 and 26.1.3 of the NEL, which

required the revocation of licenses that did not comply with the terms and conditions of the

licenses.*” They also highlight that Khan Mongolia and CAUC should have and could have,

but did not, challenge these notifications before the Mongolian administrative courts.”

206. As regards the Claimants’ reliance on the settlement by the MRAM of the dispute relating to

the suspension of the Mining License, the Respondents note that the 2010 SSIA inspection,
which revealed that some breaches had not been remedied and that others had been committed

took place after the settlement. “”'

207. The Respondents’ response to the Claimants’ specific claims of breaches of Mongolian and

international law is set out below.

(i) Expropriation and Other Violations Related to Property

208. The Respondents submit that Mongolia’s application of the NEL and the LPCNEL to the

Mining and Exploration Licenses does not amount to an expropriation under international law.

209. The Respondents argue that international law does not oblige States to compensate foreign

investors for the enactment of non-discriminatory bona fide regulations that pursue a legitimate
purpose.” The Respondents stress that Mongolia has the right of permanent sovereignty over
its natural resources.*”’ International law recognises the right of the State to regulate its energy
sector" and thereby accords Mongolia significant discretion in how it regulates the

exploitation of its mineral wealth.“°°

210. Moreover, observing that international law grants States significant latitude in how they define

211. The Respondents then contend that both the NEL and LPCNEL were applied in a non-

discriminatory manner. First, the NEL was intended not to oust Khan from the Dornod region
but to attract investors from countries other than China and Russia.*”” Second, the NEL and
LPCNEL applied in the same way to all uranium license-holders in Mongolia.*'? The non-
discriminatory application of the NEL was confirmed by the 13 October 2009 decision of the

Administrative Appellate Court.*"!

212. The Respondents note that the NEA did not treat CAUC or Khan Mongolia in a discriminatory

manner, and highlight that 165 licenses were cancelled and 49 were not re-registered.‘?

Moreover, six licenses were invalidated on the basis of Order No. 141 AB

213. The Respondents also clarify that the NEL did not result in the permanent invalidation of

minerals licenses, but only in their temporary invalidation, pending re-registration after the
fulfilment of legitimate requirements.*'* Such a temporary invalidation cannot amount to an

woe 5
expropriation.*"°

214. The Respondents explain that the application of the NEL to existing license-holders was

necessary in order to avoid a two-track system, in which different regulatory regimes would
apply to license-holders, depending on whether such entities received their licenses before or

after the enactment of the NEL.*"°

215. To address the Claimants’ argument that an expropriation occurs whenever the rights of an

investor are replaced by less favourable rights, the Respondents observe that an investor may be
said to have less favourable rights whenever a State pursues the public interest through the

enactment of legislation."””

216. The Respondents submit that the application of the NEL does not amount to a breach of

property rights under Mongolian law, relying on the 13 December 2009 decision of the
Mongolian Constitutional Court, which confirmed the constitutionality of the NEL provisions
authorizing State ownership in mineral exploration works.‘'* This decision referred to

Article 6.2 of the Constitution, which assigns property rights over “the subsoil with its mineral

resources” to the State,” and confirmed the competence of the State Great Khural to determine

the requirements for and the percentage of State ownership in mineral exploration projects.‘””
The Mongolian Constitutional Court also found that the NEL did not breach the principles of
justice, equality and rule of law, as well as property rights “consistent with universal trends of
world economic development,””' Mongolia’s obligation under Article 10.2 of the Constitution
to fulfil its international treaty obligations,” or the provisions regarding expropriation under

Mongolian constitutional law.‘”*

217. The Respondents further submit that Mongolia did not breach Article 3.6 of the Founding

Agreement. The Respondents explain that the Founding Agreement was entered into on the
basis of Article 12 of the 1995 Minerals Law, and contend that this provision did not authorize

Mongol Erdene to make the sovereign promise not to confiscate on behalf of Mongolia.

218. If the Tribunal finds that Article 3.6 contains a sovereign promise, the Respondents make the

alternative argument that this article is void under Mongolian law, because Mongolian law does

not authorize the state-owned entity to exercise rights belonging to a State.

219. But even were Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement found not to be void under Mongolian

law, the Respondents contend that they did not breach this provision. Specifically, the
Respondents note that Article 3.6 of the Founding Agreement prohibits “bituumjlekh” (freezing
or sealing) and “khuraakh” (seizure of property by authority of law as penalty or sanctions for
unlawful conduct). There was no “bituumjlekh” in this case, as the Mining License was
invalidated on the basis of Order No. 141 and a decision made not to re-register it was made
because CAUC did not comply with the requirements of the NEL for holding a license. As
well, there was no “khuraakh” in this case because the Mining and Exploration Licenses do not
constitute property under Mongolian law (see paragraphs 123-124 above) and were invalidated

pursuant to a law that applied to all radioactive minerals license holders.

Statement of Defence, j 248, referring to Exhibit C-237.
Specifically, Article 12.3 of the 1995 Minerals Law states that “[t]he obligations of the Government in
respect of its participation in the exploration for or mining of minerals shall be performed through a business
entity with State participation, and in that case that entity shall have the same rights and obligations as other
participating business entities.” Viewed in this light, Article 3.6 merely requires the parties to the Founding
Agreement to treat the common property of CAUC with the same equal regard for the purpose of the joint
venture. Statement of Defence, | 294, citing First Bayar Report, § 31. Article 3.6 also assigns the parties
equal rights, meaning that Erdene could hold only those rights that the other parties to the joint venture had.
That neither of the other entities (namely, Priargunsky and WM Mining) could make a sovereign promise is
uncontested. The creation by the Founding Agreement of a civil legal relationship means, therefore, that
Mongolia did not make a sovereign promise not to confiscate. Statement of Defence, | 295.

promise of legal stability, which makes them subject to the evolving legal framework in

221. The Respondents reject the Claimants’ allegation that the revocation of the Exploration License

breached the fair and equitable treatment standard provided in Article 10 of the ECT on the
basis that the enactment of the NEL and LPCEL did not violate the legitimate expectations of

the Claimants, if any.

222. The Respondents argue that the Claimants’ allegation that Mongolia conspired to exclude Khan

from the CAUC joint venture is unsupported by the factual record.’?* The Respondents also
reject the Claimants’ contention that Mongolia failed to act transparently in the implementation
of the NEL, by stressing the assistance of the IAEA in the development of this law, the
consultation with stakeholders, and the communication of various drafts of the NEL to Khan.*”°
They highlight the current dormancy of the Dornod Project to show that the Respondents did

not intend to develop the project for their own benefit.‘””

223. In connection with the Respondents’ response to the Claimants’ claims on property, the

Respondents further argue that the regulatory authority of the State negates the expectation that
the legal framework of the State is to be frozen for the entire investment period, absent a
specific guarantee.** Neither the fair and equitable treatment standard nor the international
minimum standard for the treatment of aliens prohibits a State from modifying its legal

framework."””

224. The Respondents then contend that investment treaties do not insure against business risk,

which should be considered by and is ultimately borne by the investor.**”’ The Respondents note

that Mongolia was undergoing rapid economic and legal changes during the execution of the
Agreements and the issuance of the Exploration License, and they contend that this situation
would have led any reasonable investor to expect an evolving legal framework in Mongolia.**!
The Respondents argue that this awareness on the part of Khan, as well as the legal significance
of such awareness, negates the Claimants’ argument that the enactment of the NEL and
LPCNEL violated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations and breached the fair and equitable

treatment standard.‘

225. The Respondents further reject the Claimants’ argument that the invalidation of the Exploration

License breached the guarantee in Article 10.1 of the ECT that Mongolia not subject the
investment of Khan Netherlands to impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures,"**
which has been defined as “something done capriciously, without reason.”*** The Respondents

5 j ther “capricious” nor “wi 20435
stress that the actions of Mongolia were neither “capricious” nor “without reason.”*

226. The Respondents reject the Claimants’ claim of breach of Article 10.7 of the ECT, a claim

433,

436

which they characterize as “a discrimination claim [based on treatment to be provided to the
new Russian-Mongolian joint venture] in the guise of a claim for breach of the MEN clause in
Article 10.7 of the ECT.”*** The Respondents explain that Mongolia and Russia have signed an

agreement that contemplates the formation of “a joint venture to exploit uranium resources in

9437

Mongolia,’ which has not yet been established, thereby rendering the Claimants’ argument

8

speculative.** In addition, the agreement between Russia and Mongolia foresees the

participation of third parties and provides for the protection of existing rights.” In fact,

Mongolia does not afford Russian investors more favourable treatment than Dutch investors,

and is, therefore, not in breach of Article 10.7.

Statement of Defence, 4] 269. The Respondents contend that Khan was in fact aware of this situation by
referring to its 2008 Annual Information Report which referred to “risks of political instability and changes
in government policies, laws and regulations,” “changes in regulations or shifts in political conditions,” and
“[the] regulatory environment [being] in a state of continuing change,” among other similar references.

227. The Respondents reject the Claimants’ contention that the Respondents breached their

obligations of good faith and loyalty under the Company Law and 2002 Civil Code by
contending that the 2002 Civil Code does not apply to relationships involving administrative
subordination, which they allege is the case here (see paragraph 123). Because the 2002 Civil
Code does not apply to the Mining and Exploration Licenses, the Respondents further contend
that these licenses do not constitute “property” for the purposes of Mongolian law (see
paragraphs 123-124). The Respondents also argue that the duty of loyalty applies only to
MonAtom, as the Company Law imposes this duty only on those who have a 20 percent or
greater shareholding in a company.“"' The Respondents contend, accordingly, that the duties of
good faith and loyalty could not have obliged Mongolia to exercise its administrative discretion

in favour of CAUC.*”

228. But even were the 2002 Civil Code and Company Law to apply to Mongolia, the Respondents

contend that neither of these “prevent[s] Mongolia from implementing a general, non-
discriminatory measure that pursues a legitimate public interest, such as the NEL and Order No.
141°“ and that Mongolia has not, therefore, breached the duty of good faith and loyalty under

Mongolian law.

229. In response to the Claimants’ allegation that the Respondents breached Article 8.1 of the

Foreign Investment Law, which accords foreign investment the legal protection of the
Constitution, the Foreign Investment Law and other legislation consistent with laws and
international treaties‘ and guarantees foreign investors access to the Mongolian legal system

445

for the enforcement of their rights,” the Respondents reiterate that the NEA’s actions complied

with Mongolian law and international law.“

230. As regards the Claimants’ allegation that the Respondents breached Article 9 of the Foreign

Investment Law, which obliges Mongolia to accord foreign investors conditions that are no less
favourable than those accorded to Mongolian investors in respect of their investments, the
Respondents note that the NEL and the LPCNEL applied to both Mongolian and non-
Mongolian investors and that Order No. 141 also applied to all license-holders without

distinction.

THE DECISIONS OF MONGOLIA’S ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS

The Claimants’ position

231. The Claimants allege that, in its Decision No. 325 of 19 July 2010 and Decision No. 340 of 2

August 2010, the Administrative Court found the Temporary Invalidation Notices and the
Permanent Invalidation Notices to be void.‘”” As regards Decision No. 340, the Claimants note

that this decision was binding between the parties because the parties did not appeal it.““*

232. In its Decision No. 374 of 13 October 2010, the Administrative Appellate Court confirmed the

holding in Decision No. 325 in respect of the notices addressed to CAUC.“” As regards
Decision No. 374, the Claimants also clarified that the administrative appellate courts in
Mongolia do not have the authority to issue binding interpretations of Mongolian law, which
only the Mongolian Supreme Court can do, meaning that the decisions they issue determine the
interpretations only between the parties to the judicial proceeding.*” The Claimants also note
that Decision No. 374 does not have an effect on the finality of Decision No. 340, as the
claimants in these proceedings were different.**' Because of this, the Claimants contend that

Decision No. 374 had no effect on the validity of Order No. 141.4

233. According to the Claimants, the effect of these decisions was to make it as if the Claimants’

. so 53
licenses had never been invalidated.‘

234. The Claimants submit that the NEA should have therefore considered CAUC and Khan

456

Mongolia’s applications for the re-registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses and
issued a decision conforming with the LPCNEL, Order No. 141 and Order No. 120. Instead,

the NEA continued to act as if the Permanent Invalidation Notices were administrative acts

435

with legal effect" by issuing, first, on 11 November 2010, a declaration in the Mongolian press

stating that the Mining and Exploration Licenses could not be reinstated and mentioning

notifications to CAUC and Khan Mongolia, stating that their licenses had not been reinstated

“since your company has not satisfied the conditions and requirements of the law.”“°”

235. The Claimants submit that, in failing to comply with the decisions of its courts, Mongolia

violated: (i) Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law (in which Mongolia committed to
provide the Claimants with the full protection of its laws);“** (ii) Article 10.12 of the ECT (in

which Mongolia guaranteed that domestic law would provide investors with effective means for

459

the enforcement of rights related to their investments); **” and (iii) the customary international

law minimum standard of treatment of aliens (under which a State’s failure to give effect to a

judicial decision amounts to a denial of justice).*”

236. In addition, Mongolia’s failure to comply with the decisions of its courts confirms the

illegitimate intent behind the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses, thus
compounding Mongolia’s breaches of Articles 10.1 and 13 of the ECT and its good faith and

non-expropriation obligations under Mongolian and international law.**'

237. The Claimants also point to Article 5 of the Mongolian Law on Administrative Procedure,

which imposes liability on a body failing to comply with the acts of administrative courts, and
Article 498.2 of the 2002 Civil Code, which imposes liability on the State or administrative

body that employs a Government official who wrongfully causes damage to another party.“

238. In response to the Respondents’ emphasis on the Claimants not having raised the issue of re-

registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses with the Mongolian courts, the Claimants
argue that the role of administrative courts is only to determine the validity of specific
administrative acts, while it is the responsibility of administrative agencies such as the NEA to
resolve petitions directed to them. The latter responsibility arises by virtue of law, not of any
court decision.** Stated differently, the obligation of the NEA to consider and issue a “well-
founded decision” on CAUC and Khan Mongolia’s license re-registration applications arose by

virtue of the LPCNEL.*“*

239. As regards the Respondents’ emphasis on the Claimants not having challenged the NEA letters

of 15 December 2010 before the Mongolian administrative courts, the Claimants note that the

availability of a domestic administrative challenge procedure does not affect the right of Khan

to challenge a confiscatory action before an international tribunal.‘°*

The Respondents’ position

240. The Respondents submit that the decisions of the Mongolian administrative courts had no

bearing on the NEA’s decision not to register the Mining and Exploration Licenses under the
NEL

 

241. The Respondents note that the decisions of the Admini ive Court in Decision No. 325 and

Decision No. 340 finding the notifications as regards the invalidation of the Mining and

Exploration Licenses invalid were based on purely procedural grounds.*””

242. First, the Administrative Appellate Court, in Decision No. 325, actually upheld the validity of

Order No. 141, which revoked all uranium licenses in Mongolia pending their re-registration
under the NEL.** The Court decided “to dismiss the claim having order No. 141 by the head of
Nuclear Energy Agency in 2009 recognized as illegal and to make modifications to the
resolution of first instance court.“ After this decision, therefore, the Mining and Exploration

Licenses remained invalidated pending their re-registration.“”

243. Second, because in the proceedings before the Mongolian courts CAUC and Khan Mongolia

did not claim that they had a right to the reinstatement of the Mining and Exploration

“7! the decisions of these courts could not have obliged the NEA to reinstate them.‘

Licenses,
And, in fact, the Administrative Court held that “in the future it shall be noted that this judicial
decision does not have any restriction on the decision regarding re-registration of the Mining
License No. 237A [.. .],’’ thus clarifying that its decision was unrelated to the NEA’s decision

ote 3
on the re-registration.“

244. In not reinstating the Mining and Exploration Licenses, the NEA therefore did not ignore any

465

decisions of the Mongolian courts. Moreover, the NEA’s decision was justified, as Khan
Mongolia and CAUC continued to violate Mongolian laws and regulations (as was noted

during the March 2010 SSIA inspection).** In fact, in the administrative proceedings in

Mongolia, CAUC and Khan Mongolia did not challenge the grounds on which the NEA

decided not to re-register their licenses.*”°

245. Accordingly, Mongolia did not violate Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law and the

Claimants cannot bring a claim for the denial of justice.’”° That Khan Mongolia and CAUC
were able to commence proceedings before the Mongolian courts and were in fact successful in
their challenges to the Temporary Invalidation Notices and the Permanent Invalidation Notices

further proves that there was no breach of Article 8.1 of the Foreign Investment Law.*””

246. Nor, in refusing to reinstate the Mining and Exploration Licenses, did the Respondents breach

the international minimum standard for the treatment of aliens. According to the Respondents,
this standard is breached by “treatment of an alien ... [that] amount[s] to an outrage, to bad
faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of
international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its
insufficiency.*”* The Respondents first contend that, in the present case, the actions of
Mongolia cannot be considered arbitrary. The NEL and the LPCNEL were valid exercises of
Mongolia’s permanent sovereignty over its natural resources and pursued a legitimate
purpose.*” In addition, the NEA’s decision not to re-register the Mining and Exploration
Licenses was taken after a series of actions involving site inspections and discussions with the
Claimants.*” Second, the due process offered by Mongolia to the Claimants satisfied the
international minimum standard, in that the Claimants were afforded the opportunity to
challenge the administrative decisions in the Mongolian courts (which they did, successfully in
some instances).’*' The Respondents point out that it is the Claimants who chose not to
challenge the NEA’s decision not to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses in the
Mongolian courts.” Finally, Mongolia did not discriminate against either Khan Mongolia or
CAUC, in that Order No. 141 applied to all uranium mining and exploration license-holders

without discrimination."

THE ALLEGED MANIPULATION OF THE MEDIA

The Claimants’ position

247. The Claimants contend that the public statements made by Mongolia about Khan — which they

characterize as revealing the autocratic tendencies of the Government — not only evince that
other conduct by Mongolia toward the Claimants has been arbitrary and discriminatory, but

also constitute an instance of wrongful conduct.**

248. Specifically, the Claimants contend that some of the statements made by Government officials

— such as: “[t]hese small Canadian companies intending to take activities in Mongolia have
done cheating. We are watching the small Canadian companies through a loop. Provided they

breach our law, we shall confiscate their licenses straight away’***

and “[t]he management of
Khan Resources is probably the lifa]rs’** — amount to illegal defamation, for which the
administrative bodies that employ these officials, or the State, could be held liable pursuant to
Article 498.2 of the 2002 Civil Code,**’ and for which the Claimants should, therefore, be able

to claim damages.***

249. The Claimants note that the status of Khan Canada as a publicly traded company in Canada

obliges it to publish information for the benefit of its shareholders and potential investors about
material events that affect its investments in Mongolia, but argue that, contrary to the
Respondents’ assertions, Khan Canada’s press releases are neutral and are not, in any case,

adversely targeted toward the Respondents.”

The Respondents’ position

1. The Respondents argue that Mongolia has refrained from responding to these allegations
publicly, and note that the Claimants’ allegations to the contrary are based on interviews
conducted with a single NEA representative, who responded to Khan’s “incorrect” public

statements only because he was confronted by them.‘

THE PARTIES’ ARGUME!)

 

'S ON DAMAGES
STANDARD OF DAMAGES

The Claimants’ position

252. The Claimants assert that their entitlement to damages is governed by the ECT, Mongolian law

. . 3
and customary international law.‘

The ECT directs the Tribunal to apply both the provisions
of the ECT and the “applicable rules and principles of international law.”*™* Similarly, while the
Founding Agreement states that it is to be interpreted in accordance with Mongolian laws, the
Constitution and 2002 Civil Code confirm that Mongolian law must be interpreted in
accordance with international law.*’> Accordingly, any award of damages, whether under the

ECT or Mongolian law, should adhere to the relevant norms and principles of international law.

253. The Claimants submit that compensation for damages under Mongolian law, whether with

respect to breach of obligations arising under the Agreements, wrongful administrative acts or
breach of civil obligations (such as those under the Foreign Investment Law and the Company
Law), should aim to put the Claimants in the position they would have been in had the
Agreements been properly performed and had the Mining and Exploration Licenses not been
illegally invalidated.’*° The Claimants rely, in support, on Articles 227, 229, 497.1 and 498.2 of
the 2002 Civil Code and Article 16.14 of the Constitution.”

254. As for the standard of compensation for Mongolia’s illegal expropriation of the Claimants’

492

496

investment in breach of the ECT, the Foreign Investment Law and the Founding Agreement,
the Claimants submit that it is to be found in the general principles of damages under customary
international law.’** This is because neither the ECT nor Mongolian law provide a standard for

assessing compensation for unlawful expropriation.”

255. The Claimants submit that the applicable customary international law standard of compensation

for unlawful expropriation, set out in the Case concerning the Factory at Chorzéw (“Chorz6w
Factory”) and confirmed by the Draft Articles of the International Law Commission on
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC Articles”), is that the
Tribunal should aim to put the claimant in the position it would have been in had the

investment not been expropriated.”

256. The Claimants argue that, by focusing on the Claimants’ interests at the time before the illegal

conduct, rather than on the situation that would have existed “but for” the Government
measures, the Respondents misapply the Chorzéw Factory standard, ignore the impact of their
own conduct, and are in fact applying the standard for lawful expropriation (set out, for

example, in Article 13(1) of the ECT).*"

The Respondents’ position

257. While the Respondents agree with the Claimants that the standard of compensation at

customary international law is the Chorzéw Factory principle that reparation must “reestablish
the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed,”*” they submit that, in a correct application of this “but for” approach to the
present case, the “appropriate compensation for a successful claimant is the sum of its
investment.’ According to the Respondents, this standard is particularly appropriate where,
as here, there are several variables between the situation existing at the time of the alleged

breach and any ultimate future profits.™

258. In respect of Article 8.4 of the Foreign Investment Law, the Respondents argue that “any award

3

ae

should therefore value compensation on the basis of Khan’s expenditure,” determined as “the

+9505

value of the expropriated assets at the time of expropriation. Mongolian courts have

construed this provision as requiring an asset-based approach to damages calculation, which is

The Claimants’ position

259. The Claimants submit that the Respondents should be held liable for damages in the amount of

USD 255 million (before interest, and not subject to Mongolian taxation).*"”

260. To assess the fair market value of the Claimants’ investments, expert firms BRG and Raymond

James applied the income-based approach and the market-based approach, respectively.** The
Claimants emphasize that these two approaches have been described by commentators as
complementary in their emphasis on earnings.” The Claimants then averaged the valuations
produced by their experts.” At the Claimants’ request, both experts assessed the value of the

“a relative valuation technique that is used to value a company by comparing that company’s

valuation multiples to those of its peers,’”*'*

and asserted that its review of investment banking

inappropriate in light of Government actions, as it is difficult to “separate any impact from a

breaches, such as the breach of fair and equitable treatment, the correct approach permits a
valuation that deviates from the time the asset was taken or interfered with, and permits a

valuation at the time of the award.”’> This is the basis for Raymond James’s use of

As for the Claimants’ estimate of costs expended on the Dornod Project,*’ Mr. Edey’s
evaluation of USD 50 million is conservative and consistent with the Claimants’ prior
statements.**' The evaluation is based on audited financial statements, which represents the

most widely accepted evidence of expenditures linked to investments.”

265. The Claimants note that many of the allegedly “insurmountable obstacles” they faced in putting

the mine into production were due to Mongolia’s unlawful conduct,** and that the Claimants
would have been able to obtain necessary financing, “[g]iven the substantial uranium reserves
reflected in the DFS.”*** Moreover, the risks cited by the Respondents as offsetting any value of
the investment were both common to mining projects and surmountable in light of the
conclusion reached in the Respondents’ valuation expert Behre Dolbear’s report that such risks
could be addressed by adding only one year to the production schedule.** According to BRG,
Behre Dolbear’s report also “double counts risk [by applying] a totally subjective adjustment
parameter it calls the chance of success.”**° The Dornod properties had numerous
characteristics that made them highly attractive to investors: evidence of the deposit’s quality
by virtue of its Soviet mining history, previous Mongolian approval of the reserves, consistent
registration of the reserves in Mongolia, and the State’s designation of the reserves as of
“strategic importance.”**” Attempted takeovers by ARMZ and China National Nuclear
Corporation (““CNNC”) in 2009-2010 demonstrate as well that the Claimants’ investment

exceeded the “zero value” asserted by the Respondents.***

The Respondents’ position

266. The Respondents submit that, should the Tribunal find the Respondents liable for breaches of

any obligations, the Claimants are nevertheless not entitled to damages, as the Claimants, in all

probability, could not have brought the Dornod Project into production.”

267. Should the Tribunal determine that damages are due to the Claimants, these damages should be

limited to the amount that the Claimants actually invested in the Dornod Project — that is,

USD 16.7 million 5”

268. In this respect, the Respondents argue that the Claimants have exaggerated the amount they

claim to have invested by including: amounts made by Mr. Mays and other predecessors in
interest; USD 1.7 million for foreign exchange losses that were not realized; USD 11.1 million
for stock-based compensation for management; USD 11.9 million for general corporate

expenses (even though Khan pursued other projects); USD 1.6 for a failed attempt to acquire

Western Prospector;*' and legal fees and settlements arising from litigation unrelated to the
Dornod Project.**

269. In the alternative, the Respondents argue that the value of the Claimants’ investment should be

calculated by reference to the share price of Khan Canada as at the Valuation Date, which,
according to the Respondents’ expert Mr. John Lagerberg, would amount to between USD 13.4
and USD 18.6 million.~” In support of this valuation, the Respondents note that CNNC’s USD
39 million offer “was deemed by Khan itself to be a good offer for the business, and that

secondly it was at an inflated, as opposed to a fair market value.”**

270. The Respondents argue that, as on the Valuation Date, Khan Canada, a publicly-traded

company, held all of the Claimants’ interests, the Claimants’ claim cannot exceed the value of
this company.** And, as stated in RosInvestCo v. Russia,’ the best evidence of fair value for a
publicly-traded company is its quoted share price in an active market.’ The Claimants’
argument that the share value of Khan Canada as it was in 2007 — two years before the alleged
expropriation — should be used is without a legal** or factual basis, designed to inflate
damages by profiting from the “uranium bubble” of 2007,°° and contrary to the value of the
Claimants’ expenditures.*' At the hearing, comparing Khan Canada’s share price against peer
group prices, the Respondents’ expert Behre Dolbear observed that the 2007 “dip in Khan’s
price purportedly caused by the actions of the Mongolian government [follows] that same drop

in the peer group prices that weren’t affected by the Mongolian government.”**?

271. Moreover, the Respondents argue that the DCF method and comparable companies and

transactions methods used by the Claimants for the assessment of the fair market value of their

investment are inapposite in the present case.

272. According to the Respondents, international tribunals have repeatedly rejected the application

certainty regarding future profitability.’ In the present case, the Claimants had not begun

“highly speculative.” First, the Claimants did not possess title to any interest capable of
exploitation.°°° In fact, for the Claimants to be able to exploit the Dornod Project, the
Exploration License would have had to be converted to a mining license,” this mining license
would have had to be merged with CAUC’s Mining License,*** and an investment agreement
with Mongolia and a joint venture agreement with the CAUC partners would have had to be
concluded.*? At the hearing, Behre Dolbear asserted that, in the absence of this investment
agreement, “the conditions under which such a merger could have occurred were very unclear
when you have 3 different parties.” Second, the Claimants would have been unable to obtain
the required financing for the Dornod Project.**! The alleged CAD 37 million previously raised
by the Claimants is dwarfed by the large amount of investment remaining to be made according
to the Claimants’ own expert (USD 336.6 million before production and another USD 200
million after the start of production)” Third, the Claimants lacked experience in mine

274. The Respondents submit that, in any event, the Claimants’ application of the DCF method is

flawed, because it does not properly reflect the specific political, business and execution risks
of Khan Canada’s ability to finance and develop the Dornod Project,*® relies on tax incentive
calculations based on long-abolished Mongolian foreign investment laws, uses a 19-year
forecast for the price of uranium (despite the limited certainty of uranium price forecasting
beyond three years), and assumes a joint operation of the Main Property and the Additional
Property with the adjacent Gurvanbulag mine owned by Western Prospector, which had
rejected the Claimants’ merger offer in 2008.” As put by Respondents’ expert John Lagerberg,
the DCF method distorts Khan Canada’s economic value because “[t]he market would give you
credit if you are about to get your hands on [financing] more than if that cash is many years and
many hurdles away.”*™ Should the Tribunal, contrary to Respondents’ submissions, decide to
apply the DCF method, it should rely on Mr. Lagerberg’s DCF calculation of USD 29.1

million”

275. The Respondents further argue that the comparable companies and transactions methodologies

are generally inadequate,”

relying on OEPC v. Ecuador for the premise that each resource
property presents “a unique set of value parameters.”*”' The Respondents criticize the
Claimants’ application of the comparable companies and transactions methodologies on the
grounds that: (i) the “comparable” companies, unlike Khan, have projects that are in
production, are located in more stable regions, possess the necessary permits and have partial or
full funding,*” (ii) the Claimants’ comparable company calculations do not adjust for
differences based on varying climatic, geographical and regulatory conditions,*” and (iii) six of
seven “comparable” transactions took place in significantly different market conditions, either

during the “uranium bubble” of 2007 or over a year after the Valuation Date.*™

276. No matter which valuation method is applied, the Respondents submit that any damages

566

awarded to the Claimants should not include any possible mining profits from the exploitation
of the area covered by the Exploration License,*” as the Exploration License does not include a

right to mine the area and is thus not an asset from which sales can be derived.*”° Moreover, the

Exploration License was set to expire in March 2011, only two years after the Claimants’

Valuation Date.*””

2. Interest

The Claimants’ position

277. The Claimants submit that a 7.5 percent compounded interest rate, calculated from the time of

taking to the payment of any awarded damages, should be applied to their USD 255 million

damages claim, resulting in a total claim of USD 326 million.

278. The Claimants rely on Article 38 of the ILC Articles for the premise that interest must be

compounded in order to reflect the reality of financial transactions,*” and on Article 13 of the
ECT for the premise that interest should be assessed at a commercial rate established on a
market basis.**” The Claimants also rely on recent case law for the general premise that interest
should be granted, and Occidental in particular for the premise that “most recent awards
provide for compound interest.”**! The Claimants further submit that the interest rate granted
should be consistent with “the concept that, prior to paying the award, Respondents will have
essentially forced Claimants to make an involuntary loan to Respondents for the period prior to

99982,

payment.”””” The interest rate should therefore reflect the risk that the Claimants are taking that

the Respondents will default on their payment.***

279. According to the Claimants, the Respondents’ argument that, under Mongolian law, interest is

payable only upon the breach of a monetary payment obligation is inconsistent with the general
standard for compensatory damages established in Articles 227 and 229 of the 2002 Civil
Code.

The Respondents’ position

280. The Respondents submit that no interest should be applied to any damages awarded. In the

alternative, interest should be awarded as simple interest,** calculated at a commercially

reasonable rate “no higher than LIBOR, or at the very most LIBOR plus | or 2 %.

281. According to the Respondents, “the general view of courts and tribunals has been against the

award of compound interest,”**’ while the award in MTD v. Chile should guide the Tribunal in

capping the interest rate at the LIBOR level.**

282. The Respondents submit that the Claimants’ preferred 7.5 percent interest rate should be

rejected because it is based on Mongolia’s foreign debt, which is irrelevant in the present

case.**” Moreover, the Claimants’ “coerced loan theory” should be rejected on the basis that

tribunals have only adopted this theory in exceptional cases.*”

The Respondents’ position

284. The Respondents submit that “the Claimants should pay all the associated costs of these

IX. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS ON LIABILITY

287. The Claimants in this arbitration have brought their claims against the Respondents on multiple
legal bases, which are listed at paragraphs 105-106 above. The Tribunal has considered the

Parties’ arguments in relation to each of the legal bases invoked by the Claimants in full.

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

However, for the purposes of this award, the Tribunal will address only those legal bases and

arguments that are necessary to reach the Tribunal’s conclusions on liability and damages.

THE ALLEGED UNITY OF INVESTMENT

288. The Tribunal first addresses the question of the alleged “unity of investment,” that is, the

Claimants’ contention that the Mining and Exploration Licenses are to be viewed as a single
investment, such that the impairment of rights conferred under one License would also

constitute an impairment of rights under the other License.

289. Whether there was a “unity of investment” matters for the purposes of determining liability and

damages. For example, the Claimants have argued that, if the Mining and Exploration Licenses
are viewed as one investment, then, although the Exploration License is held by Khan
Mongolia, an entity that is not a party to the Founding Agreement, it would suffice for the
Claimants to demonstrate that the Respondents breached Article 3.6 of the Founding
Agreement to establish liability in respect of both licenses.*”” In addition, if liability is found
and the Mining and Exploration Licenses are viewed as one investment, then damages will
have to be assessed on the basis of the value of a single Dornod Project comprising both

licenses.

290. The Claimants submit that their intention to merge the Mining and Exploration Licenses and

the informal discussions held in that regard with the partners to the CAUC joint venture suffice
to connect the two Licenses for the purposes of this arbitration. The Claimants assert that the
joint venture would not have been viable without the Additional Property covered by the
Exploration License.*** Conversely, the Respondents contend that since the Claimants took no
steps to merge the Mining and Exploration Licenses, the Tribunal should not treat the

Exploration License as part of the CAUC joint venture.*”

291. In the Tribunal’s view, the Mining and Exploration Licenses must be treated separately. In its

Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that, “by all accounts, Khan Canada (through Khan
Mongolia) acquired the Exploration License,” though Khan Mongolia was not a party to the
CAUC joint venture.® It is also undisputed that the Exploration License was never formally
merged with the Mining License, or transferred to the partners of the CAUC joint venture.”

There is no evidence that the Claimants made any formal proposals or took any active steps in

Award on the Merits

this regard. Although, as the Claimants’ assert, Khan may have intended to merge the two
licenses and informal discussions regarding a potential merger may have taken place,” the
Tribunal must take the situation as it was at the time of the Respondents’ allegedly wrongful
acts, which is that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were not in fact merged. Accordingly,
there is no legal basis upon which the Tribunal could treat the Exploration License as being part

of the CAUC joint venture.

292. Having found that there was no “unity of investment,” the Tribunal must consider separately
whether the Respondents breached their obligations toward (i) Khan Canada and CAUC
Holding in relation to the Mining License, and (ii) Khan Netherlands in relation to the
Exploration License. In the event of a finding of liability, the Tribunal will also have to assess

the value of the Claimants’ investments in Mongolia as they stood as at the Valuation Date.

B. FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW BREACHES AND LIABILITY TOWARD ALL THREE CLAIMANTS,

293. The Tribunal now turns to the question of the Respondents’ liability. In particular, in the
sections below, the Tribunal considers whether the Respondents breached their obligations

under Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law.

294. As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that a finding that the Respondents breached
Articles 8.2 or 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law in relation to each of the Mining License and
the Exploration License, as well as in relation to any related contractual rights held under the

Agreements, would suffice to establish the Respondents’ liability toward all three Claimants.

295. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that a breach by Mongolia of any provision
of the Foreign Investment Law would constitute a breach of the ECT’s so-called “umbrella”

clause, Article 10(1):

The Claimants submit that the terms “any obligations” [in Article 10(1) of the ECT]
encompass the statutory obligations of the host state and in this case, Mongolia’s
obligations under the Foreign Investment Law. Given the ordinary meaning of the term
“any” and the fact that the Respondents have not submitted any arguments or authorities to
the contrary, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ interpretation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.
It follows that a breach by Mongolia of any obligations it may have under the Foreign
Investment Law would constitute a breach of the provisions of Part III of the Treaty.

 

296. Accordingly, a finding that the Respondents breached Articles 8.2 or 8.3 of the Foreign
Investment Law in relation to the Mining and Exploration Licenses would establish that the

Respondents breached their obligations toward CAUC Holding and Khan Canada under the

Foreign Investment Law, and that Mongolia breached its obligations toward Khan Netherlands

under the ECT through operation of the umbrella clause.

DID THE RESPONDENTS BREACH ARTICLES 8.2 OR 8.3 OF THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT
Law?

1. Did the Claimants have an investment within the meaning of the Foreign
Investment Law?

297. Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law provide:

(2) Foreign investment within the territory of Mongolia shall not be unlawfully
expropriated.

(3) Investments of foreign investors may be expropriated only for public purposes or
interests and only in accordance with due process of law on a non-discriminatory basis and
on payment of full compensation.

298. On their face, these provisions protect “foreign investment” and the “investment of foreign

investors” against certain types of expropriation.

299. Article 3.1 of the Foreign Investment Law defines “foreign investment” as “every type of

tangible and intangible property which is invested in Mongolia by a foreign investor for the
purpose of establishing a business entity within the territory of Mongolia or cooperating with a
Mongolian business entity.”°“ Article 6 of the Foreign Investment Law outlines the “forms of

foreign investment,” which include “acquiring rights under the laws, concession and product

. . 99605 « i
sharing contract to exploit and process natural resources” and “concluding a contract on
marketing and management.”*””

300. It appears from these provisions that the Claimants’ rights in the Mining and Exploration

Licenses, as well as their contractual rights stemming from the Agreements, are protected as
“foreign investment” under the Foreign Investment Law only if they constitute “tangible and
intangible property” of the Claimants. This is a controversial question between the Parties, as
the Respondents contend that rights held under mining exploration and exploitation licenses do

not constitute a form of property under Mongolian law.°”

301. The Commentaries on the Constitution define “property in its broad meaning” as “the relations

between people for the purposes of acquiring individual material wealth, as well as producing
and distributing it; and property rights arise from these relationships [. . .].”°* The 2002 Civil

Code, in turn, defines “property” as “tangible assets, and intellectual values, which are

intangible property, as well as rights earned by means not prohibited by law or not conflicting
with commonly accepted behavioral moral norms [. . .].”° The Code goes on to define
“intangible property” as “[r]ights and claims that bring profit to their owner or that entitle to

demand from others [. . yo"

302. The plain text of these provisions suggests that Mongolian law is consistent with the general

notion that rights under licenses (as well as contractual rights) to exploit natural resources

constitute intangible property.

303. In support of their argument that license rights are not property, the Respondents argue that

(i) the 2002 Civil Code does not apply to relationships of administrative subordination, and that
(ii) licenses such as the Mining and Exploration Licenses cannot be transferred or pledged
freely. The Respondents’ expert, Mr. Bayar, cites a decision of the Mongolian Supreme Court,
Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom, for the proposition that “[a] mining license [. . .] is
possessed but not owned by any entity, and therefore there is no legal ground to consider such

mining licence to be a property right which is transferable to the ownership of others.”°"!

304. On the first point, the Respondents’ argument cannot be sustained. Article 1.2 of the 2002 Civil

Code states that it “shall not apply to the property relations [. . .] arising from the administrative

9612

subordination of one person to another. This provision necessitates a conclusion that
property relations may arise from situations of administrative subordination, even though the
Code itself may not apply. The Tribunal cannot extrapolate from this provision that licenses

and the rights conferred thereunder are not the “property” of license holders in a general sense.

305. On the second point, the Tribunal finds that the Mining and Exploration Licenses can be

609
610

pledged and transferred under Mongolian law.*'? The Mining License was issued under the
1995 Minerals Law, Article 14.2 of which provides that mining licenses are fully transferable

with the consent of the State:

If Parties wish to transfer or take over a licence or to amend the rights and obligations
established under it (whether in whole or in part) they shall submit an application, and the
transferee of the licence or rights shall confirm and notify in writing that he or she can
observe the obligations. The body which previously granted the licence shall give its
decision in respect of the transfer of the licence or right(s) within 60 days of the date of
receipt of the application and notification.°*

306. The Exploration License was issued under the 1997 Minerals Law, Article 12.3 of which

similarly states that the holder of an exploration license holds “the right to transfer or pledge all

or part of an exploration license in accordance with the terms and conditions of this law.”*'*

The Exploration License also confers “the exclusive right to obtain a mining license for any

part of an exploration area upon fulfilling the terms and conditions of this law.”*'®

307. Further, Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom does not provide a basis on which to depart from

the understanding of license rights as intangible property. The Respondents cite this case to
support their broader argument that, because Mongolian law places restrictions on the transfer
and pledging of minerals licenses, licenses may not be transferred freely and, therefore, may
not be considered “property.”°'’ However, the Tribunal does not agree with the Respondents’
conclusion. Generally, states may place limitations and restrictions on property transactions.
The presence of such limitations on the disposal of property does not mean that the rights in
question are not “property.” In Gobi Shoo LLC v. Mongolrudprom, the Supreme Court held that
Article 51.1 of the 1996 Minerals Law allows “that a holder of a mining licence or an
exploration licence may pledge its licence to a bank or a non-banking financial institution
together with the related documents such as the exploration work results, geological
information and feasibility study reports, and assets which are permitted to pledge by law.”*'*
The Court summarized that the 1996 Minerals Law “provide[s] that a licence alone shall not be
a pledge item.”*! The Court found that “the only possibility to pledge a minerals license” was a
limited one, and there are circumstances in which a “mining licence holder has grounds to deem
the pledge agreement illegal and void when the licence is pledged along and to persons other
than banks or a non-banking financial institu[tion] [pr Nonetheless, the existence of this
limitation on pledging does not lead the Tribunal to conclude that such licenses are not
property, even though the Respondents take out of context a quotation from the decision and

present it as a hard rule.°' Indeed, Gobi Shoo holds that a mining license may be pledged to a

2 The Tribunal is not

bank or other financial institution together with “related documents.
convinced that it should depart from the general notion of license rights being intangible

property.

308. Thus, the Tribunal is satisfied that the rights under the Mining and Exploration Licenses and

stemming from the Agreements constitute intangible property under Mongolian law.
Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that these rights are a protected investment under the Foreign

Investment Law.

2. Were the Claimants deprived of their investment?

309. The next question for the Tribunal is whether the Claimants were deprived of their investment

by the Respondents’ actions. The Claimants assert that the correct standard to be applied here is

39623

that of “substantial deprivation.’ The Respondents do not dispute this.°*

310. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants were substantially deprived of their rights under both the

Mining License and the Exploration License through the combined effect of the supposedly
temporary suspension of the two licenses by Order No. 141 and the Temporary Invalidation
Notices and the NEA’s subsequent failure to re-register them. The fact that Mongolia did not
intend to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses is supported by (i) the issuance of the
Permanent Invalidation Notices on 9 April 2010; (ii) the NEA’s 12 November 2010 declaration
in the Mongolian press that “the renewal of special permits by these companies is not a
possibility”;°* and (iii) the issuance on 15 December 2010 of Notices Nos. 4/1401 and 4/102,
stating that the Mining and Exploration Licenses had “not been reinstated since your company
has not satisfied the conditions and requirements of the law and has not pursued relevant laws

Sone i 5 962
and regulations in your operation.”**

311. Additionally, the loss of their rights under the Mining License deprived CAUC Holding and

622
03
624

625

626

Khan Canada of their rights and benefits under the Agreements. The preamble of the Minerals
Agreement makes clear that the Mining License was necessary for Khan to realize its benefits
under the Agreements, since the CAUC joint venture was established “to mine and process

uranium ore as well as other minerals [. . .] in the area of the Dornod deposit in northeastern

Mongolia for the benefit of the Parties.”®’ The Respondents had a number of obligations under
the Agreements, and the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining License made the
execution of those contractual obligations impossible.®* Without the Mining License, CAUC
Holding’s (and through it, Khan Canada’s) contractual rights under the Agreements were

essentially worthless.

312. Therefore, it does not matter that the Agreements were not formally terminated. Without the

Mining License, the Agreements could not proceed. Thus, not only were the three Claimants
deprived of their rights under the Mining and Exploration Licenses, but CAUC Holding (and
through it, Khan Canada) was deprived of the benefit of its contractual rights under the

Agreements.

3. Was this deprivation of property a Ahuraakh or a daichlakh?

313. While in their English translations Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the Foreign Investment Law both

refer to property being “expropriated,” in the Mongolian original two different words are used
in these provisions to refer to the notion of expropriation. Article 8.2 uses the word “khuraakh,”
while Article 8.3 refers to “daichlakh.”®” According to the Claimants’ legal expert, Mr. Tsogt,
these two terms refer to two distinct situations in which a taking of property can be carried out

under colour of authority under Mongolian law.”

314. Mr. Tsogt explains that khuraakh “refers to a situation in which the law authorizes the State to

627
628

29
630
6a
632
3

deprive an owner of its property due to the property owner’s breaches of law, or its use of the
property in a manner that endangers the interests of third parties.’ As put by the

Respondents’ legal expert, Mr. Bayar, khuraakh is “a seizure of property by authority of law as

39632,

a penalty for unlawful conduct by a person or entity.”””” A khuraakh may be carried out without

633

payment of compensation.” Daichlakh, by contrast, “refers to a taking of property or other

invalidation of property rights by the State under circumstances where that action is necessary

Joint Venture Agreement, Preamble, Exhibit C-17A.
As Claimants noted in their Pre-Hearing Brief (§] 39), the Agreements are clear about the obligations of
Mongolia: to “guarantee [. . .] issuance of a license permitting development of [Deposit No. 2] and [Deposit
No. 7]”; to guarantee that “[n]o area subject to a license or mineral title issued pursuant to this Agreement
may later be designated by the Mongolian Party as opened to competitive bidding as long as this Agreement
is in effect, unless such area has been returned to the Government”; and to “contribute[] the right to utilize

in order to satisfy an important public nee and must be accompanied by the payment of

compensation. Both a khuraakh and a daichlakh can be legal or illegal.°°°

315. The Tribunal observes that the Mongolian authorities explicitly justified their refusal to re-

register the Mining and Exploration Licenses by invoking alleged breaches of Mongolian law
by the Claimants. The Permanent Invalidation Notices informed Khan Mongolia and CAUC
that the “license[s] that used to be owned by [them] [were] made invalid on groundings that
[they] ha[d] not undertaken any measures to remove violations of the laws and regulations up
until now.”°” The NEA’s Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402 of 15 December 2010 informed Khan
Mongolia and CAUC that their “license[s] ha[d] not been reinstated since [they] ha[d] not
satisfied the conditions and requirements of the law and ha[d] not pursued relevant laws and
regulations in [their] operation.** In a public declaration, the Mongolian Government stated
that it had not renewed the Mining and Exploration Licenses “due to the fact that [the license
holders] ha[d] repeatedly broken the laws on Mongolian Mineral Resources, the Underground
Land usage, the Land of Especially Protected Areas, the Special Permit on Company
Operations, and ha[d] not corrected these infractions within the time frame allotted by the
law.”°” The NEA argued before the Administrative Court that it could not re-register the
Mining and Exploration Licenses because Khan had failed to correct its breaches of Mongolian
law.° In these proceedings, the Respondents also argued that the Mining and Exploration
Licenses could not be re-registered because the Claimants did not remedy their breaches of

Mongolian law.*"

316. Additionally, the Respondents did not pay (nor appeared to intend to pay) compensation to the

Claimants.

317. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining and

641

Exploration Licenses must be analysed as a khuraakh under Mongolian law.

4, Was the Khuraakh lawful?

318. Having established that the invalidation of the licenses was a khuraakh, the Tribunal must

consider whether this khuraakh was lawful or unlawful. Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment
Law only prohibits unlawful khuraakh, that is, according to Mr. Tsogt, a “situation where
property rights are invalidated under color of authority but not in accordance with due

oe 19642
authorization or process of law.”™

In order for a khuraakh to be lawful, “the law must provide
a basis to consider that the owner has forfeited its rights and, furthermore, the correct legal
process must be followed in the execution of this law. If either of these requirements is not
complied with, the confiscation will be considered illegal.” It thus appears that the
requirement of lawfulness has a substantive component (the penalty must be imposed on a valid
legal basis) as well as a procedural component (the penalty must be imposed in accordance with

due process of law).

(i) Was there a valid legal basis for the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining
and Exploration Licenses?

319. As described above, the Respondents invalidated and then refused to re-register the Mining and

Exploration Licenses on the ground of the Claimants’ alleged breaches of Mongolian law.
However, in the Tribunal’s view, the Respondents were not able to point to any breaches of
Mongolian law that would justify the decisions to invalidate and not re-register the Mining and

Exploration Licenses.

320. The April 2009, July 2009, and March 2010 SSIA Reports are the only documents in which the

alleged breaches of Mongolian law are detailed. As seen from the citations set out in
paragraph 315 above, later documents related to the invalidation and failure to re-register the
Mining and Exploration Licenses only referred to the Claimants’ general failure to remedy

violations of Mongolian law of which they had previously been notified.

321. With regard to the April 2009 Report, it is worth noting at the outset that the Claimants assert

that they saw it for the first time in this arbitration.“ As the Respondents have not been able to
show otherwise, this Report must be approached with caution. This Report lists five violations

of Mongolian law. Two out of the five violations are mentioned again in the July 2009 SSIA

646

Report,” which the Claimants acknowledge receiving at the time. For this reason, the Tribunal

° See paragraph 77 above, n. 72, referring to April 2009 SSIA Report, Exhibit R-62.

These two violations regarded (1) Article 45.1 of the Subsoil Law and Article 5.6 of the 2006 Minerals Law,
relating to the trading of shares and the publication of information regarding Mongolian mineral reserves on

83

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

considers the three unique violations identified in the April 2009 SSIA Report here, while the
other two violations are discussed in the context of the July 2009 SSIA Report below.

322. First, in the April 2009 Report, the SSIA alleged that Khan was in violation of Article 19.2.3 of

the 2006 Minerals Law, due to an overlap between the Additional Property (covered by the
Exploration License) and the Yakhi Lake Special Protected Area, a reserve set aside for grazing

animals.

323. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that this is a “hypothetical ‘violation’ lacking all

credibility.” Early maps of the Additional Property show it abutting, but not touching the
nearby Yakhi Lake Special Protected Area.“ The boundaries of the reserve area were
imprecise from the beginning.” Further, Khan worked with Government officials to remedy
the potential overlap, removing the area from its license conversion application after
consultation with the Office of Geology, Mining and Cadastre.**° Given the fact that the
boundary coordinates of the protected area were unclear, and that Khan made a good faith
attempt to remedy the potential violation, the Tribunal does not see how this alleged violation

could have justified the invalidation and failure to re-register the Exploration License.

324. Second, the SSIA alleged that CAUC had violated the Radiation Protection and Safety Law, as

had previously been noted during the 2005 and 2006 SSIA inspections. The Tribunal notes that
Khan took steps to remedy this alleged violation, including by purchasing a monitoring tool and

protective clothing for employees, and creating a waste management plan.°*'

325. Third, the April 2009 SSIA Report mentioned a violation of Article 33.1 of the Law on Special

649

650

651

Protected Areas, due to the storage of radioactive materials in a protected area. The alleged
violation concerned the manner in which Khan was storing radioactive drill cores. However,
during a site visit in December 2008 by inspectors from the SSIA and the Nuclear Energy
Commission, no violations were noted. An inspector from the SSIA even praised Khan for
being “a good example for other companies undertaking radioactive mineral exploration and
development activity,” and an inspector with the Nuclear Energy Commission noted that “[t]he

storage building complies fully with the regulations of Mongolia on radiation protection and

the Toronto Stock Exchange; and (2) Article 5.4 of the 2006 Minerals Law, due to a failure to “enter into a
mining agreement with the MRAM.” Statement of Defence, {fj 88-93, referring to Exhibit R-62.

safety requirements [...].”°*? The Chairman of the NEA followed up by writing to Khan that
“the storage of cores containing uranium complies with the radiation protection and safety
standards.”** Given this strong praise only months before the April 2009 inspection, the

Tribunal finds that Khan did not violate the law in its storage of the drill core.

326. In the July 2009 Report, the SSIA first alleged that CAUC had “failed to submit the exploration

results and work reports to the Mineral Council for its consideration” and had not “register[ed]
the reserves of the deposit with the State Registry of Mineral Resources.”*™ The 1995 and 2006
Minerals Laws require license holders to submit a reserve report and a report on the results of

exploration efforts.°°

327. The Law on Subsoil also requires that “[rJeserves of mineral resources, deposits and

occurrences shall be registered with the central national registry.”°°° However, the Law on
Subsoil puts the ultimate burden of reserve registration on the State, as it requires that “[t]he
state central administrative authority in charge of geology and mining [the MRAM] shall
monitor compliance with the following regulations and requirements, and shall take actions to

eliminate and prevent violations.”°””

328. As at October 2007, the Claimants’ reserves were validly registered, as demonstrated by the

MRAM’s 18 October 2007 letter indicating that “[t]he reserves of Dornod uranium deposit are

registered under No. 0881 in the State Integrated Database.”°*

329. In 2008, Khan submitted to the MRAM an updated reserve re-registration submission that

reflected a “new estimate of mineral resources and mineral reserves.”*” The fact that this new
estimate was not ultimately registered appears to have been due primarily to the inaction of the

Mongolian authorities.

330. The Parties agree that, before the licensing agency may register a reserve, a Team of Experts

must be appointed to accept and review the reserves report submitted by the applicant. Next,
the Minerals Council must be convened and must review and issue a decision on the conclusion
put forth by the Team of Experts. Based on the decision of the Minerals Council, the MRAM

must then register the reserves in the State Integrated Registry, or else will deny such

registration.” In this case, although Khan submitted its updated reserve re-registration
submission in August 2008, a Team of Experts was not appointed to review the submission
until October 2009,°*' after the Mining License had been temporarily suspended,®” the NEL

and LPCNEL had been passed,°®? and Mongolia and Russia had agreed on a separate joint

venture that would exploit the Dornod deposit.””” After the Team of Experts’ recommendation

was finally issued, the Claimants made a diligent effort have the Minerals Council consider the
re-registration of reserves, but in spite of such effort they were unsuccessful. When the

Minerals Council finally scheduled a meeting for January 2010, the meeting was cancelled one

6

hour before it was set to begin,° and no further meeting was ever scheduled, in spite of

multiple requests.°°”

331. Further, though the Respondents argue that Khan Mongolia’s report was not re-registered

because it contained “deficiencies” and it had undertaken “insufficient” work on exploration,“
the Claimants have shown that Khan made an updated reserves submission to remedy those
alleged deficiencies “in accordance with the experts’ conclusions, and, in order to have it
discussed at the Mineral Resources Professional Council (MRPC) and to have it in the state
register [...]. The Minerals Council and Team of Experts never requested that Khan revise

that submission.

that are ordinarily requested by the Team of Experts.°’' The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants

on this point.

333. Both Parties’ experts agree that “if the Minerals Council makes a determination that an

applicant or a private company has submitted correct information about the reserves,” then the
reserves “will be registered.”*” The Tribunal observes that, even if there originally had been
deficiencies, the MRAM should have registered the reserves once those deficiencies had been

corrected.

334. Further, even if the Claimants had failed to register reserves, the Mining and Exploration

Licenses should not have been revoked on that basis. The 1995 and 2006 Minerals Laws carry
the penalty of a fine for failing to submit work reports and reserve estimates.* The Law on
Subsoil provides no particular penalty for a failure to register." Accordingly, the Tribunal sees
no basis in law for the Government to depart from the normal sanction of a fine for failure to

register reserves.

335. Second, the SSIA contended that CAUC did not “enter into a mining agreement with

MRAM.”*” However, Article 5.4 of the 2006 Minerals Law, which the SSIA cited in its report,
concerns state participation in a mining joint venture,” and the Tribunal notes that, at the time
of the report, the Claimants had already entered into a mining agreement with Mongolia
through the Minerals Agreement and the Founding Agreement.°” The Tribunal finds that the
Claimants were not in breach of Article 5.4 at the time of the July 2009 SSIA report or
thereafter. Moreover, the 2006 Minerals Law does not give the SSIA the authority to monitor
mining agreements, and does not prescribe any particular sanction for failure to “enter into a

mining agreement with MRAM,” much less a harsh penalty such as revocation of a license.”

336. Third, the SSIA cited as a breach the fact that Khan Canada “offered [its] shares for the public

at the [Toronto] stock exchange.”*” However, the provision of law cited by the SSIA does not
prohibit such activity. Article 5.6 of the 2006 Minerals Law states that “[a] legal person holding

a mining license for a mineral deposit of strategic importance shall trade no less than 10 percent

of its shares on the Mongolian Stock Exchange.”*° The Tribunal finds that this provision
would not have prohibited Khan Canada from offering shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
In fact, as observed by the Claimants’ witness Mr. Arsenault, if the Respondents were correct,
other major mining companies in Mongolia also would have their licenses suspended, as many
of them have parent companies that trade shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange.**' The

Respondents are incorrect on this point.

337. Even Mongolia, it seems, recognized that the alleged breaches had been remedied. On

11 January 2010, CAUC reached an administrative settlement with the MRAM, and on
12 January 2010, the MRAM noted in a letter to the Administrative Court that “according to the
conclusion of the experts appointed by the order of the Minister for Mineral Resources and
Energy, the condition to eliminate the violations stated on the conclusion No. 08/01/1699 of

10 July 2009 of the inspector of the State Specialized Inspection Authority has been created.”

338. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Administrative Court held that the violations listed in the

July 2009 SSIA Report were not legitimate grounds on which to deny re-registration.**

339. The SSIA carried out another inspection in 2010, resulting in the March 2010 SSIA Report."

Some of the violations in the March 2010 Report mirrored those of the July 2009 Report,
including an allegation that CAUC had failed to register reserves.°*° The March 2010 SSIA
Report also included allegations that CAUC violated terms of the Agreements.°*° However, the
Claimants’ legal expert notes that the 2006 Minerals Law does not grant the SSIA authority to
control or monitor mining agreements.” The Respondents’ expert cites Articles 11 and 66.1 of
the Law of Mongolia on State and Local Property for the proposition that a member of the SPC
has “a clear basis [...] to monitor questions such as changes in shareholding structure and

compliance with contractual obligations in the case of an enterprise involving Mongolian State

ownership.”*** Yet, even if this is so under Mongolian law, it has not been demonstrated that
the penalty for a violation related to contractual compliance would be the invalidation of a

license.

340. In addition, the weakness of the Respondents’ argument regarding the alleged breaches of

Mongolian law strongly suggests that imposing a penalty on the Claimants for such breaches
was not the Respondents’ real motivation in invalidating and refusing to re-register the Mining
and Exploration Licenses. Other evidence presented by the Claimants, and in particular the
timing of the SSIA inspections, reports and the various invalidation notices, indicates that the
Government was in fact motivated by the prospect of developing the Dornod deposits at greater

profit with a Russian partner.

341. In January 2009, before the 2009 SSIA inspection, the Mongolian Prime Minister and the

688

689

690

691

692

General Director of RosAtom met and planned a joint venture for the exploitation of uranium
between Russia and Mongolia. In March 2009, just one week after Khan announced that the
Dornod Project was economically feasible, the Prime Ministers of Mongolia and Russia met
and “established a cooperation agreement” between the NEA and RosAtom.™” Soon after, in
April 2009, the SSIA conducted its inspection of Khan. In August 2009, then Russian President
Dmitry Medvedev visited Mongolia and, as reported in the media, formed a joint venture
between Russia and Mongolia that would “exploit the Dornod uranium deposit.””' In March
2010, the RosAtom General Director sent a letter to the NEA Chairman, thanking the NEA for
rejecting the 2010 MOU and asking how it intended to establish the “Dornod Uranum joint
venture” given that ARMZ had failed in its hostile takeover of Khan Canada. One week later,
the SSIA found additional alleged violations after another inspection of Khan. By January
2011, in the context of burgeoning agreements with Russia, Mongolian officials were making
statements in the press regarding the untrustworthiness of Khan, as well as alleging that Khan

did not hold any licenses.*” Finally, there were press releases that indicated closer cooperation

Award on the Merits

with Russia on the Dornod Project, including commentary from the mining industry that

supported this conclusion.‘

342. It is worth noting that the appointment of the Team of Experts, an essential step in the process

for the re-registration of minerals reserves, was not appointed to review Khan’s reserves re-
estimation submission until October 2009. By this point, as explained above, Mongolia had
already made an agreement with Russia on a joint venture that would exploit the Dornod
reserves. The Team of Experts’ appointment also came after the SSIA purported to temporarily
suspend the Mining License on 10 July 2009. The Tribunal observes that this confluence of
dates is not merely coincidental, as it reflects the fact that Mongolia had decided to cooperate

with the Russians on the Dornod deposit rather than to re-register the Claimants’ reserves.

(ii) Does alleged bad faith on the part of the Claimants justify the actions of the
Respondents?

343. The Respondents have invoked the Claimants’ alleged bad faith as an affirmative defence.

Specifically, the Respondents assert that the Claimants made little to no tangible progress on
the Dornod Project over a number of years, simply relying on data provided by Priargunsky to

inform its technical filings and reserves estimates.

344. The facts do not support the Respondents’ argument and it therefore cannot succeed as an

affirmative defence.

345. The factual record shows that progress was being made and that, until Mongolia’s apparent

decision to replace Khan by a Russian partner, there did not appear to be any concern regarding
the rate of progress. As noted by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction, “the studies and
reports produced by the Claimants are tangible proof that progress was being made on the
project.” Most notably, the Claimants produced a DFS, which indicated that the Dornod

Project was viable and could yield significant profits.”

346. MonAtom itself was aware of this progress. According to the minutes of a CAUC meeting in

2009, “Khan Resources stated it had completed its commitments as per the original Founding
Agreement,” and “Monatom acknowledged that, with the completion of these activities, and the

recent changes brought forward by the GOM, it was timely to review the operational

Award on the Merits

requirements of CAUC to move forward into production with a proper sharing of

responsibilities.”°*

347. Further, it is clear that the Claimants kept the Government informed of their activities. In

addition to communication by people “on the ground,”” the Claimants submitted annual
reports to the Government describing the operations of the past year.” As such, the

Respondents cannot credibly claim that the Claimants failed to keep them informed.

348. As for the Respondents’ claim that the Claimants attempted to surreptitiously deprive the other

members of the CAUC joint venture of the benefits of the Exploration License, the

Respondents have provided no evidence to support this assertion.

(iii) Was the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses carried out in accordance
with due process of law?

349. The Parties disagree on (1) whether the MRAM or the NEA was the proper licensing agency to

make the final decision on re-registration of the Mining and Exploration Licenses under the
NEL, and (2) whether certain NEL provisions apply to the decision-making procedure on re-

registration. As will be seen below, the Tribunal need not resolve these disagreements here.

350. In short, the Tribunal finds that, after the temporary suspension of all minerals licenses in

Mongolia through operation of Order No. 141, the relevant Mongolian licensing agency,
whether the MRAM or the NEA, was obliged to re-register the licenses of all license holders
who complied with the re-registration requirements set out in Attachment No. | to Order
No. 120. A failure to re-register the license of a license holder whose application was compliant
with Order No. 120, such as occurred in respect of the Mining and Exploration Licenses, thus
constituted a breach of due process. Additionally, the relevant Mongolian licensing agency was
under an obligation, at the very least, to issue a decision regarding re-registration. No such

decision was issued in this case.

351. The Parties agree that Order No. 141 was issued to implement the LPCNEL.”” Article 1 of the

698

699

LPCNEL required that “[t]he exploration and mining licenses of Radioactive Minerals issued
before the date the Nuclear Energy Law comes into force shall be newly registered according to
the conditions and procedures specified in this Law on or before November 15, 2009.”

Article 2 required a license holder to “submit an application to renew the registration of its

Award on the Merits

license to the State Administrative body in charge of the nuclear energy issues and the licenses
shall be registered and newly issued according to the Article 1 of this Law if it meets the

conditions and requirements specified in the Nuclear Energy Law.”””

352. The Parties disagree, however, about whether the NEL applied retroactively to licenses

registered under prior minerals laws. The Respondents argue that the NEL governed the
procedure for the invalidation of the Mining and Exploration Licenses.” However, the licenses
were not originally registered under the NEL, and, as the Claimants’ expert, Mr. Tsogt, notes, it
is not clear that the NEL was intended “to regulate legal situations that came into existence
prior to its entry into force [15 August 2009], or that make reference to the rights of minerals
license holders acquired or maintained under other Mongolian laws.””** For this reason, Mr.
Tsogt, suggests that the NEL “did not purport to apply retroactively.” The Respondents’
expert, Mr. Bayar, disagrees, arguing that there is no temporal limitation in the NEL and
pointing out that other changes to mineral legislation had been applied to the Mining and

Exploration Licenses in the past.”"”

353. The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Tsogt that the NEL does not apply retroactively to licenses

registered under other minerals laws. The NEL regime applies to licenses registered under that
law, and a license would need to be newly registered under the NEL for that regime to apply. In
other words, the relevant Mongolian authority would have been in a position to invalidate the
Mining and Exploration Licenses on the basis of a breach of the NEL only once the licenses

had been initially registered under that law.

354. Ultimately, it is Order No. 120 that specifies the requirements for re-registration. Order No. 120

assumes this procedural authority because Order No. 141, which purported to invalidate the

Mining and Exploration Licenses, required the NEA to follow Order No. 120.

355. Mr. Bayar states that the Mining and Exploration Licenses were invalidated according to Order

703

No. 141, noting also that the Administrative Appellate Court found the Order to be valid.”*

Thus, the Tribunal notes that the Respondents accept the authority of Order No. 141. Mr. Tsogt
also appears to believe that Order No. 141 is the proper decree to look toward in determining

whether due process was followed. Mr. Tsogt adds that, if Mr. Bayar “accepts that Order No.

Award on the Merits

141 was the basis for the NEA to temporarily revoke the Licenses, he must also accept that the

NEA should have followed the procedure for re-registration established in Order No. 141.”

356. With the Parties in agreement on the significance of Order No. 141, the Tribunal has examined

the requirements of this Order, and it agrees with Mr. Tsogt that it required the NEA to follow
the re-registration process set forth in Order No. 120.” The Tribunal also agrees with
Mr. Tsogt that, with regard to the revocation of the licenses, Order No. 141 was intended as a
temporary measure, since Article 2 of the LPCNEL required that “the licenses shall be
registered and newly issued according to the Article 1 of this Law if it meets the conditions and
requirements specified in the Nuclear Energy Law.””'' No license was to be permanently
invalidated until the re-registration application had been reviewed by the relevant licensing

agency—whether the MRAM or the NEA—and the NEA had issued an official decision.

357. The process for re-registration is described in Articles 3.1 through 4.1 of Attachment No. | to

2

Order No. 120.” Article 4.1 of Attachment No. 1 specifies that “[t]he Licensing Department
shall examine the application requesting to renew the registration of exploration and mining
license in conformity with the clause 3.1 of this instruction and shall re-issue the license if the
application has met the conditions specified in the clauses 18.2, 18.3, 18.5 and 18.6 of the

713

Nuclear Energy Law.” Article 3.1 specifies two “activities” that the NEA must undertake in
the review of applications: “[e]xamin[ing] whether the applicant [...] has completed
documents” that meet certain conditions and “[e]xamining whether the applicant [...] has paid
exploration and mining license fees and royalty [...].”""* The NEL Articles 18.2, 18.3, 18.5 and
18.6 reference Articles 17.2 and 17.3, and, read together, the NEL articles referred to in Article
4.1 of Attachment No. | require that an applicant possess, inter alia, financial and operational
ability, technological capability, and industry experience.” Together, these provisions in
Attachment No. | constitute the applicable criteria for re-registration of the Mining and

Exploration Licenses.

Award on the Merits

358. The Tribunal finds no legally significant reason why the Claimants would not have fulfilled the

above application requirements. As argued at length by the Claimants, Khan Mongolia and

CAUC possessed significant resources, capabilities, and expertise.”'°

A company of this level
of capability should have no difficulty complying with the relevant NEL requirements. Nor did
any of the Mongolian authorities rely on any purported failure by the Claimants to comply with

the relevant NEL requirements.

359. Mr. Bayar admitted at the hearing that “[i]t is written in [...] Order No. 141, the Chairman of

the NEA says to re-register,” such that “Order No. 141 required all the licenses covered by that
order to be re-registered.””'’ The Tribunal therefore finds that the licensing agency—whether
properly the MRAM or the NEA—should have re-registered the Mining and Exploration
Licenses pursuant to the process set forth in Attachment No. | of Order No. 120 and its failure

to do so constituted a breach of due process.

360. The Respondents contend, however, that re-registration could be refused on the basis of Article

26.1 of the NEL. Their legal expert, Mr. Bayar, connects Attachment No. | to Article 26.1 of
the NEL.”'* First, Mr. Bayar points out that Article 7.2 of Attachment No. 1, which states that
“[t]he Licensing Department shall invalidate the license on the grounding of the clause 26.2 of
the Article 26 of the Nuclear Energy Law,” refers to Article 26.2 of the NEL. Next, Mr. Bayar
connects Article 26.2 of the NEL to Article 26.1 of the NEL by noting that Article 26.2.1 cross-
refers to Article 26.1.’'° By so doing, Mr. Bayar suggests that the procedure set out in
Attachment No. | incorporates by reference the four grounds of invalidation prescribed in
Article 26.1, and, notably, the following ground: “[fJailure to comply with the requirement to
eliminate violations during the period of suspension of a license.” For Mr. Bayar, this
connection between Article 26.1 of the NEL and Attachment No. | would justify the NEA’s
failure to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses: “As the existence of these grounds
would justify the revocation of a license, they must justify a decision not to re-register a license.
Otherwise, the NEA would be in a position where it would re-register a license and then be

required to de-register it straight away.”””°

361. The Tribunal disagrees. Article 26.1 concerns the invalidation of licenses under the NEL. It is

not a part of the re-registration procedure. As discussed above, the Mining and Exploration

Licenses were registered under the prior minerals laws. To be invalidated based on the

Award on the Merits

conditions described in Article 26.1 of the NEL, they would have needed to first be registered

under that new law. This re-registration never occurred.

362. The Tribunal notes here that, even if Article 26.1 of the NEL were a valid part of the re-

registration procedure, the NEA would not have been justified in failing to re-register the
Mining and Exploration Licenses on the grounds of non-compliance with this provision. As
stated at paragraphs 319-342 above, the violations relied on by the Respondents did not justify

the invalidation and failure to re-register the Mining and Exploration Licenses.

363. Further, the Tribunal notes that Attachment No. | to Order No. 120 requires the Chairman of

the NEA to notify applicants of the NEA’s decision on re-registration.””' According to
Mr. Bayar’s second expert report, such notice was completed by the NEA’s Notices 4/1401 and
4/1402, which stated that the Claimants’ Licenses “ha[d] not been reinstated since your
company has not satisfied the conditions and requirements of the law and has not pursued
relevant laws and regulations in your operation.””” In contrast, Mr. Tsogt explained that
Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402 do not actually include the decision on re-registration itself, and
moreover, they give no legal bases for rejecting the application to re-register and, thus, are not

decisions pursuant to Attachment No. | of Order No. 120.”

364. The Tribunal finds that Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402 failed to provide the Claimants with the

decision that the NEA was required to provide pursuant to Attachment No. | of Order No. 120.
As Mr. Bayar admitted during the hearing, Notices 4/1401 and 4/1402 were not decisions on re-
registration: “If you are asking if the decision was made on re-registration, I will reply no, it is
not a decision on re-registration. [...] Perhaps the decision was made, but this letter is not a
legal document on par with a decision, it’s not a decision made pursuant to the Mongolian laws
and regulations.””’ The Respondents have not put forward any other document that could
plausibly constitute a decision on re-registration. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the
Government never provided such a decision. This failure to provide a final decision constituted

a breach of due process.

365. In addition to the two aforementioned breaches of due process, the Tribunal also notes that the

NEA did not appear to possess the authority to invalidate licenses issued under prior minerals

laws.”° Under prior minerals laws, that authority was legally vested in the MRAM.”° The

LPCNEL gives the NEA the authority to determine whether licenses issued under prior mineral
laws would be re-registered under the NEL, but it does not appear to give the NEA the
authority to invalidate those same licenses.” If the NEA did not possess the authority to
invalidate, through Order No. 141, all mineral licenses issued under prior minerals laws, this

ultra vires action would mean that Order No. 141 itself did not conform with the LPCNEL.

D. CONCLUSION ON LIABILITY

366. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondents breached their obligations toward the Claimants
under Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment Law in relation to both the Mining and Exploration
Licenses. This breach of Article 8.2 of the Foreign Investment Law also means that the
Respondents are liable toward Khan Netherlands under the ECT through operation of the
umbrella clause, Article 10(1) of the ECT.

X. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS ON QUANTUM

367. The Tribunal will now determine the damages caused to the Claimants by the Respondents’

breach of the Foreign Investment Law and the ECT.

A. PRINCIPLES TO BE APPLIED

368. The starting point of any quantum analysis is to identify the principles to be applied when
assessing damages. In the present case, the liability of the Respondents having been established
under the Foreign Investment Law — a Mongolian statute — and the ECT — an international
treaty — the relevant damages principles are to be derived from these two instruments, as well as

both Mongolian and customary international law.

369. The Claimants submit that the customary international law principles set out in the Chorzéw
Factory case apply, as neither the ECT nor Mongolian law set out a specific standard of
compensation for illegal expropriation.”** The Respondents also refer to the Chorzéw Factory

standard.

370. Chorzéw Factory establishes that the purpose of compensation under international law is to
“wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in
all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.”””” The Claimants alternatively

describe this standard as “address[ing] a hypothetical future situation that would have existed,

in all probability, but for the illegal conduct’ and assert that, in this case, it amounts to “fair

 

market value.””*!

371. In addition, the Respondents refer to Article 8(4) of the Foreign Investment Law, which

provides that “the amount of compensation shall be determined by the value of the expropriated

99732

assets at the time of expropriation or public notice of expropriation.”'”~ This is essentially also a

“fair market value” standard.

372. As noted by the Respondents, “fair market value” is defined by the World Bank as:

An amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller after taking into
account the nature of the investment, the circumstances in which it would operate in the
future and its specific characteristics, including the period in which it has been in existence,
the proportion of tangible assets in the total investment and other relevant factors pertinent
to the specific circumstances of each case.”

  

373. As will be seen below, the Parties disagree on the most appropriate methodology to be used to

assess the fair market value of the Claimants’ investment in the present case.”**

374. The Claimants advocate a Valuation Date of 1 July 2009, which is at the end of the quarter

during which the DFS was issued, nine days before the Mining License was first suspended,
and 44 days before the NEL was enacted.”** The Respondents do not dispute this suggested

date.”*°

375. The burden of proof falls on the Claimants to show that they have suffered the loss they claim.

The standard of proof required is the balance of probabilities. This, of course, means that
damages cannot be speculative or uncertain. However, scientific certainty is not required and it
is widely acknowledged by investment treaty tribunals and publicists that the assessment of
damages is often a difficult exercise and will usually involve some degree of estimation and the
weighing of competing (but equally legitimate) facts, valuation methods and opinions, which

does not of itself mean that the burden of proof has not been satisfied.

In addition to the question of compensation for illegal expropriation, the Claimants also state that the 2002
Civil Code creates an obligation by a person who causes damages to compensate for such damages (Article
497.1), including for lost income (Articles 227 and 229). The Claimants summarise Mongolian laws on
compensation as aiming to “put Claimants in a position they would have been in if the Agreements had
properly been performed and the [Mining and Exploration] [L]icenses had not been illegally invalidated.”

B. CAUSATION

376. The Respondents have suggested that causation between the violations of international and
Mongolian law and any loss has not been proven in the present case because there is no
evidence that the Claimants could have taken the mine into profitability. Consequently, the
Respondents argue that the Claimants’ investment had no value and no damages should be
awarded (or, at most, compensation should be limited to the investment already made by the

Claimants).7°7

377. The Tribunal does not agree. While there may have been a number of uncertainties that needed
to be overcome by the Claimants before the mine could come into production — as discussed
below — the fact that the Dornod Project itself had a considerable inherent value as at the
Valuation Date is clear from the DFS. The Claimants’ investment in the Dornod Project
therefore also had value, as acknowledged by the Respondents when they stated that “[t]he
Claimants had always sold off their interests after carrying out exploration in the past, and the

reality is that [they] expected to do the same here.””**

378. The Claimants clearly would have realised value from selling their interest in the Dornod
Project to a willing buyer. As noted above, this reflects the definition of fair market value —
what a willing buyer would have paid the Claimants for the mine on the Valuation Date.
Moreover, the Claimants have provided examples of other companies in similar situations that
have taken similar projects through to production and therefore the Tribunal accepts that this
may well have occurred in the present case. In any case, whether Khan would have sold the
mine or developed it to production is not the issue at hand. The issue is what the mine’s market

value was on the Valuation Date — prior to the Respondents’ breaches.

379. The Tribunal does not consider the fact that the Exploration License over the Additional
Property had not yet been converted into a mining license to be a causation issue, as suggested
by the Respondents. It is clear that, under Mongolian law, a mining license will be granted
provided the requisite conditions are met. The evidence in the record demonstrates that the

requisite conditions were being met.”*° The Tribunal finds that Khan Mongolia was taking the

737 Statement of Defence, § 354; Rejoinder, §{ 233, 259.

®8 Rejoinder, § 240.

7° The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants’ legal expert, Mr. Tsogt, that the conditions for the conversion of an
exploration license into a mining license were that the applicant: (i) hold an exploration license; (ii) be a
legal person formed and operating under the laws of Mongolia; (iii) pay the applicable annual fee; and (iv)
submit a final report on the results of the exploration work, including an estimate of the ore reserve. See
Second Tsogt Report {| 35-48, referring to 2007 Minerals Law, Exhibit CLA-140, arts. 10.2, 12.2, 17.1,

relevant steps and that, had the Mongolian Government not decided to abandon the project in
favour of working with Russian partners, a mining license over the Additional Property would

likely have been granted in due course.

Similarly, the fact that licenses over the Main Property and the Additional Property were held
separately at the time does not mean that the venture had no value. If the two properties needed

to be mined together to be economic (as both Parties agree),”°

a willing buyer would clearly
have wished to purchase both properties. The fact that no formal merger had taken place by
July 2009 does not prevent a valuation being undertaken of the Claimants’ overall investment
in Mongolia (although, as discussed below, it is a factor when considering which methodology

may be appropriate for valuating the project).

The other issues raised by the Respondents as going to “causation” (e.g., whether financing
would have been raised or whether a new joint venture agreement was needed) are relevant to
assessing the correct methodology, but do not demonstrate that the Dornod Project had no
intrinsic market value as at the Valuation Date. The Tribunal takes these factors into account

below.

In summary, the Tribunal finds that, in the light of the DFS, the Respondents’ primary position

that Khan’s investment in the Dornod Project was of no value at all is untenable.

OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE

Before considering the methodology for calculating damages and the specific amount of any
loss suffered by the Claimants, it is pertinent to clarify the percentage of the Claimants’ interest

in the Dornod Project for the loss of which compensation is due.

As at the Valuation Date, Khan Canada and CAUC Holding owned 58 percent of CAUC
(which held the Mining Licence over the Main Property), while Khan Netherlands owned 75
percent of Khan Mongolia (which held the Exploration Licence over the Additional Property),
with the remaining 25 percent being held by Khan Bermuda (and, through it, by Khan Canada).

The Claimants’ expert, Dr. José Alberro (of BRG), assumed that this meant that the Claimants
held 58 percent of the interest in the resources of the Main Property and 100 percent in the
resources of the Additional Property, and, based on the resources available in each property,

concluded that the Claimants had an interest in 68 percent of the total resources found in the

Exploration License, 19 December 2006, endorsements, Exhibit R-6. As for condition (iv), Khan Mongolia
took the requisite steps to register the ore reserves. As described in paragraphs 329-334 above, the
registration did not take place due to the inaction of the Government.

™ Statement of Defence, {f] 378-379; Reply, § 380.

Award on the Merits

two properties.”*!

The Respondents’ expert, Mr. Lagerberg, provided three alternative
calculations, using ownership figures of 58, 62 and 68 percent.” Mr. Lagerberg arrived at the
ownership percentage of 62 on the basis that the Claimants are only entitled to claim damages
for 75 percent of the resources of the Additional Property, as this represents Khan Netherlands’
interest (through Khan Mongolia) and therefore the percentage interest subject to an ECT
claim. The third figure of 58 percent was based on the assumption that the Claimants’ interest
in CAUC would have remained unchanged if the Additional Property had been merged into the
CAUC joint venture (i.e., the merger of the two properties would have occurred without any
alteration to the shareholding percentages of the three joint venture partners or any other

compensation to the Claimants).”?

386. The damages assessment is being made as at | July 2009, before any formal merger had taken

place. Given that at the Valuation Date Khan (that is, Khan Canada, CAUC Holding and Khan
Netherlands) had an interest in 68 percent of the resources of the two properties, and given that
it is impossible to know the percentages that may have been agreed had the properties been
formally merged after July 2009, the Tribunal considers that, as a starting point, 68 percent is
the appropriate adjustment to apply. Consequently, the Tribunal does not consider

Mr. Lagerberg’s third alternative of 58 percent to be appropriate.

387. The only remaining issue, therefore, is whether, under the ECT, the Claimants can only recover

75 percent of the value of the Additional Property, being the percentage owned by Khan
Netherlands. If so, the overall percentage of the two properties for which the Claimants could

seek damages would be reduced to 62 percent.

388. The Claimants argue that the ECT provides that the controlling investor is entitled to

741

74s

100 percent of the damages in relation to the covered investment, even if the remainder of the
investment is not owned by an entity covered by the ECT.” The basis for this argument
appears to be that the Exploration License itself would qualify as an investment under the ECT
by virtue of being indirectly controlled by Khan Netherlands through its majority shareholding
in Khan Mongolia — i.e., the licence is a covered investment, not just the shares in Khan

745

Mongolia.” This reasoning, however, does not automatically lead to the conclusion — as the
Claimants appear to assume — that Khan Netherlands can claim for 100 percent of the loss of an
investment in which it only has a 75 percent interest. Principles of reparation in international

law, as set out in Chorzéw Factory, are clear that a claimant is entitled to compensation for

losses it has actually suffered — not for losses suffered by third parties over which the tribunal
has no jurisdiction. Only express wording to the contrary in a treaty could override this
fundamental principle. No such wording has been provided in the present circumstances and the
Tribunal concludes it has no jurisdiction to award compensation in relation to the 25 percent

interest in the licence owned by Khan Bermuda.

389. The Tribunal therefore finds that the correct ownership percentage to adopt is 62 percent (of the

value of the Dornod Project).

D. METHODOLOGY TO BE APPLIED

390. The Tribunal has been presented with three principal methodologies by the Parties: DCF,
market comparables and market capitalisation. The Tribunal examines each of the
methodologies below, but has ultimately come to the conclusion that — while all of them are
valid and widely-used methods for valuing mines — none of these methodologies are wholly
satisfactory in the present case. This conclusion is not a reflection on the expert witnesses, all of
whom the Tribunal found to be helpful and professional. Ultimately, however, the Tribunal
considers that the true value of Khan’s investment is better reflected by the offers made for the
mine or for Khan Canada’s shares in and around the relevant period than by the more

traditional methodologies advanced by the Parties.

1. DCF

391. The Claimants advocated using a DCF method, which they state is appropriate for determining
the fair market value of a mine with proven reserves.” According to the Claimants, once these
reserves are known, together with the costs associated with development and production, the
market price for the relevant resource can be applied to estimate future earnings with
reasonable certainty. It therefore does not matter that the mine has not actually come into full
production or is not a functioning “going concern.” The Tribunal agrees that, in the case of a
mine with proven reserves, the DCF method is often considered an appropriate methodology

for calculating fair market value.”

392. However, in this particular case, there are a number of additional factors and uncertainties
which, in the Tribunal’s view, make the use of the DCF method unattractive and speculative.

These uncertainties include:

(i) how the Dornod Project would have been financed;

746 Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief, p. 24.
7 See e.g. Occi 1 Petroleum Corporation and Occi | Exploration and Production Company v,
Ecuador, \CSID Case No ARB/06/11, Award, 24 September 2012, Exhibit CLA-207.

 

 

101

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

(ii) | whether a further strategic partner would have been brought into the business and,
if not, whether Khan was capable of bringing the Dornod Project into production

itself;

(iii) | whether Khan would have taken the Dornod Project through to production or sold
it;

(iv) when and how the Additional Property would have been merged into the CAUC

joint venture to create a single “Dornod Project”; and

(v) the signing of various agreements (an investment agreement and a new joint

venture agreement) to finalise the commercial terms of the Dornod Project.

393. The combination of these factors does not mean, as the Respondents allege, that the Dornod

Project had no value in the Claimants’ hands,’ but it does mean that the level of certainty
required for the DCF method to be used has not been attained. In particular, it is far from
certain: (i) whether the mine would actually have reached production; (ii) if it did, on what
terms the parties would have participated in the venture; and (iii) whether the Claimants would
still have been involved in the Dornod Project at all. In this context, the Tribunal finds that the
DCF method is inappropriate and that any damages calculated through it would be too

speculative.

2. Market comparables approach

394. The Claimants’ valuation expert, Mr. Kevin J. Carter (of Raymond James), used the market

comparables approach to determine the value of the Dornod Project on the Valuation Date. He
considered both “trading comparables” and “transaction comparables” to arrive at an overall

value of USD 245 million.””

395. In his first expert report, to derive a figure based on trading comparables, Mr. Carter reduced an

initial list of fifty uranium companies to what he considered to be the ten most comparable

companies. He stated that:

This list was selected based on several criteria including but not limited to, project stage,
resource size and quality, technical risks associated with development/operation, and
recovery method. In selecting comparable companies, the public companies considered
should be comparable in terms of commodity mix, geographic location, operating
characteristics, growth prospects, risk profile and size.”*°

396. Mr. Carter also identified seven comparable transactions and noted that:

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

Ideally, comparable transactions considered would be comparable with the [Dornod]
Project in terms of commodity mix, geographic location, operating characteristics, growth
prospects, risk profile and size.”"'

397. The Respondents accept that market comparables are a valid way of valuing a mine in

circumstances where other more reliable data is not available. However, the Respondents state
that this methodology is only as good as the comparables chosen and that, in the present case,
the comparables are not truly “comparable” to the Dornod Project. Therefore, according to the

Respondents, Mr. Carter’s conclusions are unreliable.’

398. Although Mr. Carter may have used the companies he considered most comparable to Khan,

the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents’ damages experts’ criticisms of Mr. Carter’s selection
and considers that the companies and transactions chosen are not sufficiently comparable to
allow the Tribunal to make a true determination of Khan’s fair market value. Reasons for this

conclusion include the following:

(i) CAMECO, Denison Mines Corp., Paladin Energy Ltd., and Uranium One Inc —
being large, producing, multi-project companies — are not appropriate comparables

for Khan.

(ii) | With respect to the remaining six junior mining companies, the differences
presented in Table 8.1 of Behre Dolbear’s second report are, taken together,
sufficient to cause concern as to the accuracy of any valuation based solely on

3

those comparables.’ These differences were similarly summarised by

Mr. Lagerberg at Appendix 2 of his second report.’

(iii) The comparable transactions chosen suffer from similar issues, as the projects
concerned were in different locations with different conditions and stages of
development, all of which are factors that have a significant effect on value.”** The
Tribunal is not convinced that sufficient adjustments were made — or could be

made — to account for these differences.

399. Overall, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondents’ observations that the comparables chosen

represent “companies whose sites are based in different countries, under varying climatic,
geographical and regulatory conditions to those experienced by Khan.””° This is one of the key

reasons why arbitral tribunals are often reluctant to rely on a comparables analysis as the sole or

First Raymond James Report, p. 12.

Award on the Merits

primary method of valuation.”*’ The difficulty of finding truly comparable companies in the

present case makes this method unattractive.

3. Market capitalization or “Quoted Market Price” (“QMP”) approach

400. The market capitalization approach advocated by the Respondents on its face has much
attraction. The Tribunal accepts that Khan Canada ultimately held the investment that is the
subject of this dispute and that it was essentially a “single-project” company. The market
capitalisation of Khan Canada should, therefore, reflect the market’s (i.e., a willing buyer’s)
view of the value of the company and its interest in the Dornod Project. Using this approach,
Mr. Lagerberg calculated that Khan Canada’s market capitalisation in April-July 2009 was
between USD 14.8 and USD 20.4 million.”** Mr. Lagerberg then discounted this price to reflect
the possibility that the part of the Claimants’ investment for which compensation is due
includes only a 75 percent interest in the Additional Property and thus arrived at his final

estimate of a value between USD 13.4 and USD 18.6 million.”

401. Absent countervailing factors, this should be the simplest and most accurate reflection of the
value of the Claimants’ interest in the Dornod Project and is preferable to the approximations
and estimations provided by the DCF and market comparables methodologies, which are used
in the absence of an accurate valuation. The Tribunal therefore needs to consider whether, in
the present case, there were other factors affecting the share price of Khan Canada as at the

Valuation Date that would make it an inaccurate reflection of the value of the Dornod Project.
402. The Claimants reject a QMP approach. They argue that:

To properly apply a QMP Approach [. . .] there are two key requirements: first, the shares
must be liquid, and, second, the share price must be analyzed in a period in which it has not
been negatively impacted by the complained of measures.”

403. Thus, the Claimants suggest that events prior to July 2009 had created concern within the
market and had unduly distressed Khan Canada’s share price such that it was not an accurate
indication of the investment’s value. Therefore, the Respondents’ illegal conduct would be
taken into account if a valuation date in July 2009 were to be used for this method. In
particular, the Claimants suggest that Mongolia’s actions in 2007 had a lasting effect on Khan

Canada’s share price. Dr. Alberro observed:

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

On August 17 2007, Khan announced it had received a notice from the Mineral Resources
Authority of Mongolia (the “Minerals Authority”) advising that the Minerals Authority had
determined that the decision to issue Khan’s [Exploration License] was considered invalid.
Khan’s share price declined 48% on the announcement with 4.8 million shares trading on
that day, more than 10 times the average volume for the preceding 20 days. The market
reaction reduced Khan’s market capitalization by Cdn$90.0 million.”

404. The Claimants also state that the market in July 2009 was “illiquid,” making a QMP approach

inappropriate. In the event that a QMP approach is used, the Claimants advocate a valuation
date in early August 2007, which, in the Claimants’ view, would ensure that no negative effect
of the Government’s temporary invalidation of the licences in 2007 would be included in the

valuation.”

405. The Tribunal has examined the movements of Khan Canada’s share price and cannot see any

permanent impact on it of the temporary invalidation of the licences in August 2007. The
Tribunal accepts the Respondents’ position that none of the ECT and Foreign Investment Law
violations complained of by the Claimants had occurred prior to 1 July 2009. In principle,
therefore, there is no reason to shift the share price two years earlier to August 2007, at which

time the short-lived “uranium bubble” artificially inflated the value of the Dornod Project.

406. It appears to the Tribunal that the share price of uranium companies generally fell in late 2007

as the so-called “uranium bubble” burst and the global credit crisis began. The movement of
Khan Canada’s share price at this time seems consistent with that of other uranium companies.

The graph on page 58 of the Rejoinder clearly demonstrates this trend.”

407. However, the Tribunal does have concerns that the QMP approach produces a valuation for the

Claimants’ interests in the Dornod Project that bears little or no relation to the inherent value of
the project as set out in the DFS.”“ This may mean that, when the DFS was released in April
2009, the market was indeed already suspicious of Mongolia’s motives and therefore
approached Khan Canada cautiously or that, as argued by the Claimants, the “illiquid” nature of

the market at the time makes the approach unreliable.

408. Whatever the reason, it seems clear from the contemporaneous offers discussed below that a

willing buyer in or around the relevant time was willing to pay much more for Khan’s
investment than suggested by the Respondents’ QMP approach. The Respondents have not
been able to offer any persuasive evidence to explain why their proposed value as at July 2009

(before the expropriation) was lower than the later offers by ARMZ and CNNC in November

2009 and February 2010 (after the expropriation). Faced with this reality, the Tribunal does not
consider that the valuation advanced by the Respondents reflects the true market value of the
investment. The Tribunal therefore accepts the Claimants’ position that, as of July 2009, the

market price of Khan did not reflect the intrinsic value of the Dornod Project.

409. In any case, if the Respondents’ contention that the Dornod Project had no value in the

Claimants’ hands is put aside, both Parties acknowledge that the minimum that the Claimants
would be entitled to receive as compensation for any expropriation is the equivalent of their

investment in the Dornod Project to date.”

The Tribunal accepts that the Dornod Project had
moved beyond a minimal stage of development, particularly after the release of the DFS.
Consequently, a “sunk investment” approach is not appropriate. However, such an approach
can serve as a “bottom line” below which compensation should not fall. Unfortunately, even
the costs figure in this arbitration has proved controversial, although it seems to fall somewhere
between USD 16.7 and USD 50 million. The fact that the Claimants’ investment is likely to be
higher than the market capitalisation calculated by the Respondents means that the QMP
approach is of limited use, unless the upper end of the Respondents’ range is used. Although
the investment made is the minimum the Claimants should be entitled to recover, the Tribunal
agrees with the Claimants that it is not an accurate method for ascertaining the fair value of a

mine,” and therefore the Tribunal has looked to other information in its possession.

conclusions set out in this section, the Tribunal has been guided by the following principles and

conclusions:

[w]hat is required is not the selection of an arbitrary figure but the application of
principles which at least enable the reader of the judgment to discern the factors which
led the Court to fix the sum awarded. Moreover, those principles must be capable of
being applied in a consistent and coherent manner, so that the amount awarded can be
regarded as just, not merely by reference to the facts of this case, but by comparison
with other cases.”

(iii) The Parties have agreed that the date of the valuation is 1 July 2009 and that a fair

market value approach is appropriate.

(iv) The costs, DCF, market comparables and QMP methods are not appropriate for the

reasons set out above.

(v) | Having discounted these other methods, the only remaining material on the basis
of which the Tribunal might estimate fair market value is the various offers that
were made between 2005 and 2010 for the shares in the CAUC joint venture or

Khan Canada, as set out in detail in this section.

(vi) | When examining this material, the Tribunal is mindful of the comments of Sergey

Ripinsky and Kevin Williams in Damages in International Investment Law:

Valuation can be performed on the basis of past transactions with the evaluated asset
itself. Such transactions, whether actually executed or only contemplated by the parties
at arm’s length, represent strong evidence of the asset’s [fair market value], provided
that no value-affecting factors have interfered between the date of the transaction and
the valuation date.””

411.

Hence, the three offers made to acquire the shares in the Dornod Project during the relevant
period are the best information presented to the Tribunal in terms of the real value of the
Claimants’ investment. The two most relevant offers time-wise are the offers made in late 2009
and early 2010 by ARMZ and CNNC respectively. ARMZ was already a minority shareholder
of Khan Canada and made a hostile takeover bid in November 2009 for the remaining shares at
approximately CAD 0.65 per share.” This resulted in an overall offer of USD 33 million (net-
of-cash USD 18.2 million).’”' Mr. Lagerberg calculated that this offer included a 44 percent

control premium.”

412. The offer made in February 2010 by CNNC was for all shares in Khan Canada. The offer was

made at CAD 0.96 per share and, on Mr. Lagerberg’s calculation, included a control premium

of around 33 percent.””* The total offer for all shares was USD 53 million (net-of-cash USD

39.1 million)’

Mr. Lagerberg speculated that CNNC’s offer may have been higher due to
synergies that the company was hoping to achieve.’ However, the Tribunal has been presented
with no evidence or detail as to such synergies. Given that the control premium seems to have
been smaller in the CNNC offer, the Tribunal finds no evidence to support a contention that the

price was unduly inflated.

413. The ARMZ offer was rejected by Khan’s shareholders, but the CNNC offer was accepted

(although it did not progress due to a failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals from
Chinese authorities). Of course, these offers were made after the expropriatory acts had taken
place and were thus made in a distressed environment. The fair market value of the investment
must therefore be presumed to be higher than the CNNC offer. As stated by the Claimants,
these offers provide only “a very conservative baseline”’”* for the value of the Dornod Project

which, when assessed from a willing buyer / willing seller perspective would have been higher.

414. The only other evidence of offers to acquire the Dornod Project is the Government’s offer to

sell to Khan Canada its 21 percent shareholding in CAUC in November 2005. This offer is
obviously more distant time-wise. It was also made before proven reserves had been confirmed
in the DFS. However, it has the advantage of having been made well before there was any hint
of the expropriatory acts (including the 2007 temporary invalidation of the licences) and of not
being affected by the “uranium bubble” of 2007. The offer represented a valuation of
Mongolia’s 21 percent shareholding agreed after almost a year of negotiation. The agreed value
was USD 31.5 million.”” Dr. Alberro calculated that this translates to an overall value for
CAUC of USD 150 million (being USD 31.5 million / 21 percent).””* The Tribunal accepts
Dr. Alberro’s explanation that the offer for Mongolia’s CAUC shares was exclusive of the
USD 50 million capital cost that Khan had agreed to finance in addition to payment of the sum
of USD 31.5 million for the 21 percent interest in CAUC. There is therefore no basis on which
to deduct the USD 50 million from the agreed price as suggested by Mr. Lagerberg.””

415. The Claimants submitted that the offer of 2005 is conservative because at that time no

definitive feasibility study had yet been completed and the long term uranium price was

approximately one third (USD 22 per pound) of that in 2009 (USD 65 per pound in the
Claimants’ case). However, the Tribunal also accepts that market conditions were less
favourable in 2009, which would have affected a prospective buyer’s ability to raise finance
and other important factors related to value. A prospective buyer would also face the
uncertainties of attempting to merge the Main Property and the Additional Property and of
negotiating new agreements with the other joint venture owners (uncertainties which made the
DCF model unattractive). Therefore, because there are factors which suggest both better and
worse conditions in 2009 for a sale, the Tribunal has decided to make no adjustments to the
2005 figure. Any attempt to adjust the figure up or down to account for other factors would be

speculative.

The 2005 offer provides a value for the CAUC joint venture and therefore the overall value
derived from this offer does not include the Claimants’ interest in the Additional Property,
which included part of the resources in Deposit No. 2. The Tribunal accepts that the 2005
Mongolia offer suggests that the Additional Property would provide a further USD 50 million

of value, equating to an overall value for the two properties of around USD 200 million.”*°

In order to estimate the value of the Claimants’ investments in the two properties, the overall
value must be divided by the percentage of the resources for which the Claimants are entitled to
compensation. As discussed above, the appropriate percentage to represent the Claimants’
investment in the Dornod Project is 62 percent, yielding on the basis of the 2005 offer a value

of USD 124 million.

In this case, all three offers suffer from clear “value-affecting factors” and therefore an
adjustment would need to be made to reflect the change in value between July 2009 and the
date of any given offer. As such, the value of the Dornod Project as at the Valuation Date
cannot be determined precisely, but this does not mean a fair value cannot be determined at all.
Rather, the Tribunal has used its best efforts to balance these issues and arrive at a damages

estimate that it considers reasonable in the circumstances.

Having examined the offers carefully, the Tribunal considers that the offer that most closely
approximates the fair value of the Claimants’ investment as at July 2009 is CNNC’s offer of

February 2010, for the following reasons:

(i) The offer is sufficiently close temporally to the Valuation Date for the Tribunal to
be satisfied that general market conditions would not have altered so significantly

as to considerably affect valuation.

780 See Reply, 4 377, n. 803.

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

(ii) | The value of Khan Canada’s shares improved following the ARMZ offer and,
unlike the ARMZ offer, the CNNC offer was not a hostile takeover bid motivated
by an apparent desire to further an alternative joint venture between the Russian

and the Mongolian Governments.
(iii) |The offer was acceptable to Khan Canada’s shareholders.

(iv) By the time CNNC made its offer, the 2010 MOU had been signed between the
Claimants and the Mongolian Government, which would suggest that the
investment was less distressed than it was when the ARMZ offer was made
(although the 2010 MOU was rejected by the NEA before the offer was formally

announced to the market).

(v) | When the CNNC offer was made, steps were being taken to register the proven

reserves.

(vi) |The CNNC offer was made by a Chinese investor that had no prior investment in
the Dornod Project. CNNC must therefore have been satisfied that it could

persuade the Government to re-register the licenses.

Clearly, however, despite the efforts of Khan Canada to work with the Mongolian Government
to restore the licences, the investment remained in a distressed state. A fair market value as at
July 2009 must take into account the actions of the NEA between July 2009 and January 2010,
and the valuation must be adjusted to remove the impact of such actions. To do this, the
valuation derived from the 2005 offer is informative. In the Tribunal’s view, the 2005 offer —
which was made almost four years prior to the Valuation Date — is too distant to serve as the
basis for assessing fair value in July 2009. Market conditions, both generally and in relation to
uranium, altered significantly in the period from 2005 to 2009. However, the value of the
Claimants’ investment in 2005 (USD 124 million) and the value of the proven reserves as
estimated in the DFS (net present value of USD 276 million, which would result in the
Claimants’ investment being valued at USD 171 million) are informative when assessing the
adjustment that should be made to the CNNC offer. Both valuations suggest that CNNC would
have acquired the investment at a significant discount had its purchase been approved by the

relevant Chinese regulatory authorities.

Taking all of the above into account, the Tribunal considers that the fair value of the Claimants’
investment as at July 2009 is USD 80 million. The Tribunal has applied a 100 percent
adjustment factor to the CNNC offer to eliminate the effects of the Respondents’ actions post-
July 2009. The figure takes into account the considerable challenges and uncertainties that

would face a new investor in order to realise the value of the proven reserves at Dornod. It also

110

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

takes into account the Claimants’ prior investment into the Dornod Project and the fact that
considerable further investment would have been needed. The Tribunal considers this figure to
provide fair and reasonable compensation to the Claimants for the loss of their investment. It
reflects the Tribunal’s best and conscientious effort at assessing the fair value of the Claimants’

investments immediately prior to the Government’s illegal acts.

422. The Respondents do not dispute that, if damages are awarded to the Claimants, the Claimants

would be entitled to interest on those damages. The Respondents also do not dispute that the
minimum standard on which interest should be awarded is at a “commercially reasonable

ssT81

rate,”"” the underlying principle being that interest is required to effect “full reparation” for the

breach and therefore should be applied from the date of expropriation.”

423. The Claimants have argued that they have effectively been forced to take an involuntary loan

from the Government and that the Respondents’ borrowing rate of 7.14 percent is therefore the

appropriate interest rate to apply. The Claimants request interest on a compounding basis.’**

424. The Respondents state that interest should be simple and awarded at a commercial rate of

LIBOR or, at most, LIBOR plus | or 2 percent. The Respondents note that the Claimants’

approach has been rejected by most ICSID tribunals as not being commercially reasonable.”

425. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that the interest rate requested by the Claimants is

too high and that using Mongolia’s borrowing rate is not equivalent to a “commercially
reasonable rate.” The Tribunal considers that an interest rate based on LIBOR plus a small
percentage reflects a commercially reasonable borrowing rate over the relevant period. This
view is consistent with recent practice amongst ICSID tribunals and the prevailing scholarly
view. It is also consistent with recent practice to compound interest, rather than to award it on a

simple basis (as used to be the prevailing view).”*°

426. Taking the above into account, the Tribunal concludes that a commercially reasonable interest

rate would be LIBOR plus 2 percent. The Tribunal therefore orders that interest be calculated at
a rate of LIBOR plus 2 percent compounded annually from | July 2009 until the date of
payment of this Award.

XI. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS ON COSTS
A. INTRODUCTION

427. As set out at paragraph 283 above, the Claimants have claimed USD 13,405,158.50 in costs.

This amount is broken down as follows:

(i) Legal costs: USD 6,991,731.82, consisting of legal fees already paid of
USD 3,748,171.82, plus a success fee to be paid of USD 3,243,560;

(ii) | Expenses incurred by the Claimants’ legal counsel: USD 530,680.20;
(iii) Expert witness costs (fees and travel): USD 1,112,271.96;

(iv) Other arbitration expenses paid by the Claimants, including vendor charges and
expenses for duplicating, translating, etc., costs associated with counsel, client and
witness travel and paying factual witnesses for their time and expenses:
USD 269,315.58. This includes payments to Mr. Arsenault of USD 125,661.05, to
Ms. Davis of USD 38,650, and to Dr. Jamsrandorj of USD 20,800;

(v) “Other costs” specified as the costs of keeping the Khan companies running while
the arbitration was continuing, including the cost of salaries, accounting services,

insurance, office expenses and investor relations: USD 4,093,404.12; and

(vi) Costs of the arbitration: USD 407,754.82.”

B. THE UNCITRAL RULES
428. This arbitration is governed by the UNCITRAL Rules.
429. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules states, in relevant part, that:

1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems
appropriate, in another decision.
2. The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be
fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;

(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral
tribunal;

(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses
are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(c) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the
extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

PCA Case No. 2011-09
Award on the Merits

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses
of the Secretary-General of the PCA.

[ed

430. Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules states that:

1. The costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties.
However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it
determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case.

2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other
award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of
the decision on allocation of costs.

431. The text of UNCITRAL Rules clearly evidences a presumption in relation to the costs of the
arbitration that such costs will follow the event, i.e., that the successful party is entitled to
recover from the unsuccessful party the costs of the arbitration which the former has incurred.
In relation to the costs of legal representation, no such presumption exists and the Tribunal is
free to determine the allocation of such costs at its discretion, subject to the requirement that
they are reasonable. Of course, the Tribunal’s wide discretion in relation to legal costs includes
the discretionary power to order that such costs will also follow the event, i.e., that the amount

of the successful party’s legal costs will be recovered from the unsuccessful party.

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S FINDINGS
1. Costs of the arbitration

432. In relation to the costs of the arbitration, having considered the Parties’ submissions in detail,
the Tribunal concludes that there are no extraordinary factors that would cause it to depart from
the presumption that costs follow the event. The Claimants were the successful party in the
merits phase of the arbitration. There are no countervailing circumstances that suggest that the
Claimants should not be compensated for these costs. In particular, the Tribunal does not find
that either the Claimants or the Respondents acted inappropriately in their conduct of the
arbitration. As such, it is appropriate that costs should follow the event as provided in Article
42 of the UNCITRAL Rules and that the Claimants should be able to recover their share of the

costs of the arbitration as the ultimately successful party.

433. The Parties deposited with the PCA a total of EUR 700,000 (EUR 350,000 from each side) for
this arbitration. The PCA has determined that the final costs of the arbitration are
EUR 634,882.37, including the fees of the arbitral tribunal, which, in accordance with Article
40(2)(a) and Article 41 of the UNCITRAL Rules, are fixed as follows:

(i) Professor David A. R. Williams Q.C. — EUR 189,006.89;

(ii) | Dr. Bernard Hanotiau — EUR 131,781.13; and
(iii) The Hon. L. Yves Fortier PC CC OQ QC — EUR 126,999.42.

The PCA’s fees and expenses for registry services amount to EUR 94,481.72.

Other Tribunal costs, including for hearing facilities, court reporters, interpreters, courier

P bank costs, P and supplies, amount to EUR 92,613.21.

Accordingly, the costs of the arbitration, including all items set out in paragraphs (a), (b), (c),
(d), and (f) of Article 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules amount to EUR 634,882.37, or
USD 710,510.00.

The Tribunal orders that the Claimants’ share of the costs of the arbitration (being

USD 355,255.00) be borne by the Respondents.

The unexpended balance of the deposit shall be returned to the Parties in accordance with

Article 43(5) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Section 6.4 of the Terms of Reference.

2. Legal and other costs

As noted above, the Tribunal has wide discretion to decide on how to allocate the legal and

other costs incurred by the successful party, if at all.

The Claimants were largely successful in their claims. Because of this success, the Tribunal, in
its discretion, considers that the Claimants should be entitled to recover at least some of their

reasonable legal and related costs in the present case.

Specifically, the Tribunal finds that the costs claimed by the Claimants in relation to expert
evidence (USD 1,112,271.96) are reasonable. The Tribunal also finds that the disbursements.
incurred by the Claimants’ legal counsel (USD 530,680.20) are reasonable. While the

Respondents have noted that these disbursements are considerably larger than their own,”*”

this
is not uncommon in an international arbitration where the claimant often produces a much
larger amount of documents and is responsible for preparation of materials for the hearing. The
Tribunal therefore orders that the Claimants should be entitled to recover from the Respondents

these costs, together amounting to USD 1,642,952.16.

The Claimants have also claimed approximately USD 4 million in other costs related to the
costs of keeping Khan Canada and related entities running — such as salaries, insurance, office
expenses, investor relations costs etc. — while the arbitration was continuing. The Tribunal

agrees with the Respondents that these costs do not fall within any of the categories set out in

787 Respondents’ Letter to the Tribunal, dated 15 April 2014, p. 3.

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.”** They are, therefore, not recoverable. In particular, the

cost of running these companies is not a “legal and other cost[] incurred by the parties in

99789 790

relation to the arbitration,”’”’ as suggested by the Claimants.

The Tribunal also does not consider that the cost of time spent by witnesses in preparing
witness statements or preparing and attending the hearing is recoverable under Article 40 of the
UNCITRAL Rules. The Claimants confirmed that three of their factual witnesses (being those
no longer employed by Khan entities) were reimbursed for their time in preparing statements
and attending the hearing.””' These costs amount to USD 185,111.05. The Tribunal finds that

the Claimants are not entitled to reimbursement of these costs.

Other expenses claimed by the Claimants amount to USD 84,204.53 (being USD 269,315.58
minus USD 185,111.05). The Claimants have stated that these expenses relate to vendor
charges, additional duplication costs, translation costs and travel expenses for witnesses, all of
which fall within Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.”” The Tribunal therefore orders that the

Claimants are entitled to recover these costs, which it finds reasonable, from the Respondents.

The final issue concerns the Claimants’ costs of legal representation. This is an issue only
because of the success fee arrangement that the Claimants have entered into with their legal
representatives. The Tribunal notes that the time spent by counsel for the Claimants (which
would have incurred a fee of approximately USD 5.7 million if it had charged at the firm’s
normal rates) is reasonable. This is additionally confirmed by the fact that the time for which

this amount is being claimed is similar to that spent by counsel for the Respondents.

The Claimants have confirmed that they will be liable to pay the success fee if a favourable
award is rendered. A favourable award was said to “involve a decision of the Tribunal

confirming the liability of Respondents resulting in an award of damages.”

Counsel for the Claimants has provided a redacted copy of the agreed fee arrangement. On the
basis of the information before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that the decisions rendered in this
Award will result in the Claimants being liable to pay the success fee to its counsel. Although
this is not a fee that has been “incurred” to date as required by Article 40(2)(e) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, it is a fee that the Claimants have already incurred a legal obligation to pay.

The Tribunal thus finds that it is recoverable under this same provision. Moreover, creating a

distinction between “incurred and paid” fees and fees for which the liability has been incurred
seems artificial, given that the Tribunal could, in theory, render a partial award on liability and
quantum, followed by a separate costs award that would include the paid success fee. The same

conclusion was reached in Siag v Egypt.’”*

448. The Respondents’ primary objection to the success fee was that details of the fee arrangement
were not fully disclosed by the Claimants.” The Respondents did not object to the legality of
the fee arrangement or the reasonableness of the arrangement itself. Although the Respondents
retained their disclosure objection following the provision of further information by the
Claimants — including the provision of a redacted fee agreement letter — the Tribunal, as noted
above, considers that sufficient detail and evidence of the success fee arrangement has now
been provided by the Claimants. There is therefore no basis on which the Respondents’

continued disclosure objection can be sustained.

449. As a result, the Tribunal orders that the Claimants are entitled to recover legal costs in the

amount of USD 6,991,731.82.

450. In summary, the Tribunal therefore finds and declares that the Claimants are entitled to be paid
by the Respondents a total of USD 9,074,143.51, calculated as follows:

Arbitration costs USD 355,255.00
Expert costs USD 1,112,271.96

Disbursements USD 530,680.20

Other costs USD 84,204.53
