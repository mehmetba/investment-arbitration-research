1. This decision is issued regarding the request of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the

 

“Appli on Annul it”, “Vi la” or the “Republic’”) to maintain the provisional stay
on the execution of the award issued on July 25, 2017 by the tribunal comprised of Messrs.
Eduardo Zuleta (President), Yves Derains and Horacio Grigera Naon (the “Tribunal”) in ICSID
Case No. ARB/13/11, initiated by Valores Mundiales, S.L. and Consorcio Andino, S.L. (the
“Respondents on Annulment” or “Valores and Consorcio” and, jointly with the Applicant on

Annulment, the “Parties”) against Venezuela (the “Award”).

107. In this case, in light of what has been commented, the Committee considers that the
existence of circumstances that require the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award,
pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention, has not been proven. In this regard, the
Committee deems particularly relevant the difficulties encountered in ensuring compliance with
the ICSID awards issued against Venezuela and the fact that Venezuela has officially declared
its policy of opposition to compliance with those awards, circumstances that have also been

considered in other decisions issued by annulment committees.

108. Therefore, the Committee concludes that there are no reasons to continue the stay of

enforcement of the Award.

VI. DECISION

113. For the foregoing reasons the Committee decides:
a. To lift the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award; and

b. To reserve its decision on costs.
