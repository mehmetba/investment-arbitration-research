Messrs. Bruno Leurent, Thomas Bevilacqua, and Ivan Urzhumov, and Mmes. Angelynn Meya

and Hana Doumal of Foley Hoag LLP in Paris.

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

This dispute arises out of a series of legislative measures taken by Ecuador in connection with its
hydrocarbons industry. The measures were taken following the significant increase in oil prices
that began in the first half of the 2000s.

At the heart of this dispute is the operation of the Participation Contract concluded in 1996 between
a consortium of foreign investors (“Consortium”) in which Murphy held an interest through its

100% owned subsidiary, Murphy Ecuador Oil Company Limited (“Murphy Ecuador’), and the

 

p of the stat d entity P dor. According to Claimant, the Participation
Contract operated such that the Consortium would receive a share of the production calculated on
the basis of the volume of production and without regard to oil prices. However, when oil prices
spiked, the government enacted legislation, known as Law 42, that provided that Ecuador would
participate in the Consortium’s profits from the sale of crude oil if the market value of the oil
exceeded a reference price (“Law 42”). Initially the government set the level of its participation
at a minimum of 50 percent. Several months later the government raised the level of its

participation to 99 percent.

Claimant submits that Law 42 constituted a unilateral and unlawful modification of the
Participation Contract by Ecuador and had a significantly detrimental effect on the financial
performance of Claimant’s investment. It contends that it had no other choice but to forego its

investment by selling its interest in the Consortium, which it did in March 2009.

Murphy claims that Law 42 breached Ecuador’s obligations under the Treaty between the United
States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal
Protection of Investment (“BIT”, “Treaty” or “US-Ecuador BIT”). It seeks reparation in the
form of compensation for (1) the payments Murphy Ecuador made to Ecuador under Law 42; (2)
the cash flow that it would have received through Murphy Ecuador from the date of its sale through

the end of the Participation Contract’s term; and (3) interest.

According to Ecuador, the rise in oil prices was exceptional and unexpected. In light of it, virtually
all oil producing countries implemented legal adjustments, on the one hand, to maintain their
agreements with petroleum sector operators and, on the other hand, to protect public interest over
natural resources. Ecuador contends that Law 42 was one such measure, legitimately instituted in

accordance with Ecuadorean constitutional and procedural requirements.

Following the implementation of Law 42, Ecuador entered into negotiations with the
Consortium—as well as with other operators—to agree modified terms to the Participation
Contract. It states that while negotiations proceeded successfully with the other Consortium
members, they did not with Murphy. Murphy refused to agree to a modified contract and elected
instead to sell its interest in the Consortium—which it did profitably—and pursue arbitration, first

at ICSID (unsuccessfully), and then here.

Ecuador argues that Claimant has failed to allege losses that are distinct and separate from the
losses allegedly suffered by its former subsidiary, Murphy Ecuador. After Murphy sold Murphy
Ecuador, the latter settled all claims related to those losses and withdrew its claims, with prejudice,
from the Repsol ICSID arbitration that the Consortium had commenced under the Participation

Contract, in exchange for a new oil production agreement.

Ecuador denies having breached the US-Ecuador BIT. It rejects Claimant’s assertion that Law 42
effected an alteration of the contracting parties’ agreed formula governing their sharing of the
extracted petroleum. According to Ecuador, Law 42 is a “matter of taxation” and thus expressly
excluded from arbitration by the tax carve-out clause in the Treaty. The only claim that is capable
of surviving the tax carve-out is expropriation, which Ecuador rebuts on several grounds. It seeks

the dismissal of all of Claimant’s claims.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

A. Murphy’s relationship with Canam and Murphy Ecuador

Murphy operated in Ecuador through Murphy Ecuador Oil Company Limited (“Murphy
Ecuador”), a wholly-owned, Bermudan subsidiary of Canam Offshore Limited (“Canam”).
According to Claimant, Canam was incorporated in the Bahamas in November 1966 and acquired
by Murphy on | June 1970.!7 Canam is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Murphy. Up until 2004,
Murphy Ecuador was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Murphy. In 2004, Murphy transferred
Murphy Ecuador to Canam.'*

B. The Ecuadorian oil industry

From the 1960s onwards, oil exploration and development became a major activity in Ecuador. At
that time, Ecuador had adopted the “concession contract”? model according to which investors paid
the Government for exploration and exploitation rights under liberal concession terms.'°
Following significant increases in oil prices in the 1970s, Ecuador nationalised its oil industry.
Concession contracts with foreign investors were terminated and transferred to the State oil
company, Corporacion Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana (“CEPE”), the immediate predecessor of

Petroecuador.””

In the early 1980s, Ecuador enacted several reforms in a renewed attempt to attract foreign

investment to its oil industry. One such reform consisted of a modification to Ecuador’s

Hydrocarbons Law to allow Petroecuador to enter into “service contracts” with foreign investors.”!
Under the service contract model, investors could bid for exploration areas. If they found

reserves, the would undertak

the necessary exploration and development

of the reserves in return for a fee from the Government for the contractor’s services and

reimbursement of its costs. The contractor would not enjoy any share in the oil produced.

P would maintain ip over all oil production.”

45. There were several downsides to the service contract model. First, there was little incentive for
contractors to develop the reserves to their maximum capacity. The payment from the Government
was the same regardless of the volume of oil production. Also, when oil prices were low, there
was a risk that the cost of the contractor’s services would exceed the revenue obtained by the
Government from oil sales. Additionally, the Government could not control the contractor’s costs

and there was no real incentive for contractors to keep costs down.

C. The original investment in Ecuador under the service contract model

46. Murphy Ecuador’s original investments in Ecuador involved three separate oil exploration and
production projects governed by service contracts, in respect of three areas: Block 16 of the
Amazon Region of Ecuador (“Block 16”); the Bogi-Capir6n Common Reservoirs—an area
adjacent to Block 16 (“Bogi-Capirén”)—; and the Tivacuno area of Ecuador’s Amazon Region,

adjacent to Block 16 in the north (“Tivacuno”).

47. The first contract concerned Block 16. On 27 January 1986, Petroecuador and a consortium of oil
companies comprised of Conoco Ecuador Ltd. (“Conoco”), Overseas Petroleum and Investment
Corporation, Diamond Shamrock South America Petroleum B.V., and Nomeco Latin America
Inc. (“Consortium”) executed the Service Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of
Hydrocarbons in Block 16 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (“Block 16 Service Contract”).

The Consortium appointed Conoco as the initial operator.”*

From 1986 to 1996 the Block 16 Service Contract governed the relationship between the

Consortium and Petroecuador. Under its terms, exploration and production operations in Block 16

and the Bogi-Capirén field were carried out by the Consortium in exchange for the fees set forth

in the Block 16 Service Contract. The Consortium also operated the Tivacuno field under the

Tivacuno Contract.

54. Conoco’s first oil discovery occurred in the first half of 1987.7 As a result, the Consortium
P plans for the ideration of P “° The plans included an

economic analysis of commerciality based on investment and production costs and anticipated
production volumes of crude oil and a per barrel price of USD 15.50.*! According to Respondent,
the Government would approve the exploitation phase if it determined that the discovered reserves
were “commercially exploitable” and capable of generating revenues to ensure a 15% profit
margin for Petroecuador.*? The Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the plans in September
1991, at which point the development phase of the exploitation portion of the Block 16 Service

Contract became effective.’ Production from Block 16 began in December 1994.

55. By 1995, it had become apparent to the Government that the sale of crude oil from Block 16 was
insufficient to cover the costs and expenditures of the Consortium as well as provide a return to
the Government. Governmental authorities reported that “the State Enterprise has received
absolutely nothing so far as a result of exploitation from this contract.”

56. The poor results under the Block 16 Service Contract and certain other contracts prompted
Ecuador to review the contractual arrangements governing Block 16 and other similar projects.*°
Ecuador sought to convert the service contracts to participation contracts under which the investors
would own a share of oil production but assume their own costs and, inherently, the risk of low
oil prices. Such an arrangement would provide an incentive to contractors to develop the reserves

to their full potential. As was the case with the service contracts, the ownership of the resources

would remain with the State, but the remuneration to the contractor would be based on a

production-sharing modality provided for in the contract.

57. The change from service contracts to participation contracts required an amendment to Ecuador’s
Hydrocarbons Law. On 29 November 1993, the amendment—also known as Law 44—was
implemented through Decree 1417.* In a statement preceding the change in the Hydrocarbons

Law, the Ecuadorian President Duran Ballén—in office from August 1992—stated:

[T]he limited financial resources that the country has [...] do not justify
PETROECUADOR’s assumption of all the risk involved in exploration activities;
such risk must be shared with international petroleum companies. [...]

The Services Contract has become an extremely complex contract in terms of
management and control, due to the relationship of dependency created among
the various State agencies. Moreover, the provision for mandatory reimbursement
of the contractor’s investments, costs and expenses has significantly reduced the
participation of the State in the economic benefits of oil exploration and
production in medium and small fields.

Finally, the Service Contract does not permit the contracting company to have a
production flow of its own. This characteristic goes against the interest and raison
détre of international oil companies, for the majority of whom the availability of
production is an essential aspect of marketing in international markets.

The new proposed contract—the participation contract—will allow Ecuador to
position itself at an internationally competitive level for attracting venture capital,
because the contractor company, through the bidding process, shall set the

i itions for the iP ion for its i The State, in any
case and whichever the production level, shall have priority to receive a share of
the production of the area under the contract.*”

58. The desire on the part of Ecuador to transform the service contracts was part of a broader scheme
to make foreign investment in its hydrocarbons industry more attractive. In addition to the change
in the Hydrocarbons Law, Ecuador passed the Investment Promotion and Guarantee Law on 19
December 1997—also known as Law 46—the stated objective of which was to “promote national
and foreign investment and regulate the rights and obligations of the investors so that they may

effectively contribute to the economic and social development of the country.”** These and other

steps were taken by Ecuador with the aim of creating a legal and regulatory environment attractive

to foreign investors in the hydrocarbon and other sectors.

59. In the same vein, Ecuador also amended its Constitution to provide a stable and reliable legal
framework for the promotion of foreign investment in all economic activities, which, inter alia,

guaranteed that foreign investment would be afforded the same treatment as national investment.”

60. In an official letter dated 20 August 1996, Petroecuador gave notice to the Consortium of its
decision to modify the Block 16 Service Contract into a participation contract.“° In a document
dated 22 August 1996, the Consortium agreed to modify the Block 16 Service Contract and the

Parties agreed to agree upon the terms and conditions of the new contract."

61. Also on 22 August 1996, the Executive President of Petroecuador appointed a committee in charge
of renegotiating the Block 16 Service Contract. The committee conducted a detailed analysis of
the consequences of modifying the Block 16 Service Contract into a participation contract. The
results of its analysis were recorded in a report entitled “Report from the Negotiating Commission
to Modify the Service Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons into a
Production Sharing Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 16”

(“Renegotiating Committee Report”).*? One of the Committee’s conclusions was:

Since the State’s production sharing under the modified contracts does not depend
from Contractor’s costs and investments but, rather, from the level of production,
the State obtains an assured production sharing percentage of 19.3% under these
contracts. This does not exist in the current contracts because the State runs
practically all the risk.?
62. The Government and the Consortium also considered whether to continue with the joint
exploitation of the Bogi-Capirén reservoirs with Block 16 or to transfer those operations to
Ecuador. The Committee concluded that it would be better to continue with the joint exploitation

of the reservoir because a transfer to the State would entail greater risks for the State."

63. From 22 August to 24 October 1996, the Consortium and Ecuador negotiated the conversion of
the Block 16 Service Contract to a participation contract.* According to Respondent, during
negotiations—and given the requirement that a contract modification could only be recommended

by the Government negotiators if it was in the interest of the State—negotiators had to pursue
terms that would provide the State with at least the 15% margin that it expected to receive under

the Block 16 Service Contract.“

D. The Participation Contract

64. On 27 December 1996, the Consortium and Petroecuador agreed upon the modification of the
Block 16 Service Contract to a participation contract by executing the Modification of the Service
Contract into a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons
(Crude Oil) in Block 16 of the Amazon Region of Ecuador (“Participation Contract”).”” It was
to last until 31 January 2012.**

65. The Participation Contract ensured that the Consortium members enjoyed full rights of ownership

over their share in production.”” Clause 4.2 of the Participation Contract stated:

The Contractor shall have the exclusive right to perform, at its own cost and risk,
the exploitation activities of Crude Oil and additional exploration in the Contract
Area, investing capital and utilizing personnel, equipment, machinery and
technology needed for its exact fulfilment, and in exchange the Contractor shall
receive, as participation, a percentage of the Controlled Production.”

66. The Participation Contract also set parameters to calculate the parties’ respective participation

shares. As noted in the Renegotiating Committee Report, the factors negotiated with the

45 Renegotiating Committee Report, CEX-35; Annex V of the Participation Contract (Report of the Negotiation
Commission, 1.9), REX-61; Participation Contract, Supporting Document C (Minutes of the Commitment

Contractor were as set out below. These parameters were to be included in the calculation formula
of the respective shares:
BLOCK 16:
L1 = 20,000 barrels per day

L2 = 40,000 barrels per day

X1 = 84.74%
X2 = 77.00%
X3 = 60.00%

BOGI-CAPIRON:

L1= 5,000 barrels per day

L2 = 15,000 barrels per day

X1 = 82.00%

X2 = 73.50%

X3 = 62.00%!
According to Claimant, the price of oil was not a variable included in the calculation formula;
rather, its participation share was to be based only on the number of barrels produced per day.”
Claimant submits that one of the main goals of the conversion to the Participation Contract was to
allocate to the Consortium the risk of fluctuations in the global price of oil: if the price of oil was
excessively low, the Consortium had no right to claim that it was not able to recoup its investment.

By the same logic, if the price of oil was high, the Government had no right to claim that the

Consortium’s share of the profits was too high.

Clause 8.1 of the Participation Contract contained the formula for calculating the parties’

respective participation shares. It set forth a decreasing percentage of the Consortium’s

 

participation when the daily producti ded the thresholds of 20,000 barrels per day and
40,000 barrels per day. Accordingly, Ecuador’s participation increased proportionately when the

Consortium’ s participation decreased. Clause 8.1 provided as follows:

8.1. Calculation of Contractor’s Production Sharing: Contractor’s
Production Sharing shall be calculated according to the following formula:

PC=*%io9

Where:

PC = Contractor’s Production Sharing.

Q = Fiscalized Production.

xX = Average factor, as a percentage rounded up to the third decimal
point, corresponding to Contractor’s Production Sharing. This is
calculated in accordance with the following formula:

XH Nal +x2@Q+X3a3/
4

Where:

q = Average daily Fiscalized Production for the corresponding Fiscal
Year

ql = Portion of q lower than L1

q2 = Portion of q between L1 and L2

q3 = Portion of q greater than L

Parameters L1, L2, X1, X2, and X3 are the following:

 

LI = 20,000 Barrels per day
L2 = 40,000 Barrels per day
X1 = 84.74%
X2 = 77.00%
X3 = 60.00%

The State’s Production Sharing cannot be less than 12.5% if the Fiscalized
Production (q) does not reach 20,000 Barrels per day. Production sharing shall
increase to a minimum of 14% if the daily production is between 20,000 and
40,000 Barrels, and shall not be less than 18.5% if production exceeds 40,000
Barrels per day.

In consequence, Contractor’s Production Sharing may in no case exceed the limits
of 87.5%, 86%, and 81.5%, respectively.

In order to determine The State’s Production Sharing and Contractor’s Production
Sharing, “Q” shall be estimated in advance by the Parties every quarter. In order
to determine the definitive State’s Production Sharing and Contractor’s
Production Sharing, the actual values corresponding to the Fiscalized Production
and API degrees for the relevant Fiscal Year shall be used. The X factor shall be
estimated during the first ten (10) days of the corresponding Quarter on the basis
of the daily Fiscalized Production and its quality during the immediately
preceding Quarter. Upon commencing Fiscalized Production, and while it is not

the amounts of 5,000 and 15,000 barrels per day. See Bogi-Capirén Contract, cl. 9.3, CEX-37.

possible to estimate and apply the X factor according to the above procedure,
Contractor’s Production Sharing shall be assumed to be equal to X2. In order to
calculate the definitive X factor, Fiscalized Production and quality shall be used
according to their actual values for the relevant year or fraction thereof and shall
be settled during the first Quarter of the Fiscal Year next following.

69. Clause 8.2 of the Participation Contract provides that:

The Participation of the Contractor, calculated on the basis of the sales price,
which in no event shall be lower than the Reference Price, plus any other income
that the Contractor’s activities may receive in relation to this Contract, shall be
the gross income of the Contractor under this Contract; from that gross income,
[Contractor] shall make any deductions and shall pay income tax, in accordance
with Clauses 11.1 and 11.2.*4

70. Clause 8.5 of the Participation Contract provides the formula for calculating the State’s

participation:
PE = (1-9 %, 5,

71. After determining the Consortium’s participation, which was deducted from total production, the

remaining portion of crude oil was then delivered to the Government.**

72. Claimant relies on the Hydrocarbons Law and Decree No. 1417 as affirming that the only relevant

factor for assessing its participation was the amount of oil produced:

The contractor, once production has begun, shall have the right to a participation
in the production of the contract area, which will be calculated on the basis of the
offered percentages and agreed-upon in the contract, taking into account _the
volume of produced hydrocarbons. This participation, valued on the basis of the
price sales of the hydrocarbons of the contract area, which in no event shall be
lower than the reference price, shall constitute the gross income of the contractor
from which it shall make any and shall pay the income tax, in accordance with
the regulations of the Internal Tax Regime Act.*°

 

Participations: Upon commencement of hydrocarbon production, to be measured
at the inspection and delivery center, contractor shall be entitled to its
participation in the production of the contract area, which shall be calculated using
the formula established in the conditions of contract, on the basis of the

therein agreed upon of the hydrocarbons produced. In any case the
State, through PETROECUADOR, shall receive its participation at the inspection

and delivery center, where it shall be measured and calculated using the formula
established in the conditions of contract.”

73. According to Claimant, all parties involved in the negotiation of the Participation Contract were

sophisticated actors, who were aware that the exclusion of the price of oil as a factor in the

 

participation formula was deli 8 This is Claimant alleges, by the fact that
some of the same negotiators concluded a participation contract over the Tarapoa field, which
contained a price-variable mechanism entitling the Government to increase profits in the event the

price of oil exceeded a certain amount.”

74. According to Respondent, the price of oil was an integral part of the formula for calculating the
parties’ shares in participation.” It submits that the basic reference price parameter—known as
the “uniform price” and equalling USD 15.26 per barrel—was imbedded in the determination of
the X1, X2, and X3 factors.°! It is included as a basic parameter in the Report of the Negotiating
Commission, which is part of Annex V of the Participation Contract. Clause 3.3.9 of the
Participation Contract defines the Participation Contract as: “this instrument, including its annexes
and exhibits, which jointly are denominated ‘Participation Contract for the Exploration and

Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block (16).””

75. According to Respondent, the parties also agreed upon the following investment rates of return

(“IRR”) during the execution of the Participation Contract:

76. On the same day that the Participation Contract was concluded, the Consortium and
Petroproduccién also executed new contracts relating to the Bogi-Capirén Common Reservoirs
and the Tivacuno Area.°° With respect to the latter, the Specific Services Contract was not
converted into a participation contract. The modified contract, however, incorporated an economic
formula similar to that found in the Participation Contract. While the Consortium assumed
similar risks of exploration, it acquired no ownership rights to a share of the production.®’ The
Consortium’s fees were calculated as a percentage of the value of the oil produced in the contract

area.

77. On 10 January 2001, Repsol YPF Ecuador SA (“Repsol YPF”) assumed the role of Consortium
operator.” It received its interest in the Consortium as follows: (a) on 31 January 1992, Conoco

E. The increase in global oil prices

78. From the mid-1980s until the beginning of the 2000s, crude oil prices had remained stable at
around USD 20/bbl. In early 2002, global prices for crude oil began to rise significantly. The
upward trend continued steadily and in 2005 exceeded most projections to reach USD 60/bbl. In

July 2006, oil prices reached a record high of USD 75/bbl.”

79. In September 2005, Ecuador’s President Palacio Gonzalez was reported as stating that the State
wished to reorganise the participating contracts to “achieve a 50% share for the country.” In the
same report, the former Minister of Energy, Fernando Santos, was reported as stating that “all
contracts must be respected because they have the effect of law for the parties, but they may be
amended by mutual consent.””°

80. On 1 March 2006, President Gonzalez presented to Congress a bill to amend the Hydrocarbons
Law.” The bill was then sent for review by the Commission on Economic, Agricultural, Industrial
and Commercial Matters (“EAIC Commission”) within the Ecuadorian Congress.” The EAIC
Commission prepared a report on the bill, which was submitted to the Congress for debate, in

which it raised several concerns regarding the bill’s constitutionality:

The bill, as proposed by the President of the Republic, would contain some
constitutional violations against the stability of contracts executed in good faith
and the legal certainty, therefore, as expressed by the majority of Representatives
during the first debate, the bill must be reformulated and adjusted to constitutional
provisions. [...]

It is indispensable to respect the constitutional guarantee of investments and
contracts [...]”*

81. In the same session of the parliamentary debate, one of the representatives also warned about the
risks that Ecuador could face if the bill was passed as it had been proposed by the Executive

Branch, in violation of the rule of law:

[A] very important aspect that we need to consider is that Argentina, which
modified contracts unilaterally, is now facing claims in an amount of US$17
billion. That is exactly what will happen to us, Ecuadorians, if contracts are
modified unilaterally or by means of a law; we are going to get a flood of
international claims, and the amounts of future judgments against us will be
catastrophic.”

F. The enactment of Law 42 and the issuance of Decree No. 1672 (“Law 42 at 50%”)

82. On 29 March 2006, the Ecuadorian Congress passed Law 42."° It took effect on 25 April 2006.

 

Law 42 applied to all investors holding participation contracts. It amended Article 44 of the

Hydrocarbons Law so as to entitle the State to receive from oil companies with participation

contracts what was described as “participation in the surplus of oil sale prices”.*!

83. Law 42 also amended Article 55 of the Hydrocarbons Law, thereby granting the State a
participation of at least 50% of the “extraordinary income” arising from the price difference
between the then prevailing oil price and the oil price prevailing at the date the participation

contracts were concluded, multiplied by the number of oil barrels:

State’s participation in the surplus of oil sale prices, which have not been agreed
upon or foreseen.—Contractor companies that have current participation
contracts with the State for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation,
notwithstanding their crude oil participation volumes, when the monthly average
FOB Ecuadorian crude oil sale price exceeds the monthly average FOB sale price
prevailing as of the date of execution of their contracts, stated at constant prices
as of the month of payment, shall grant the Ecuadorian State a participation of at
least 50% of the extraordinary income arising from the price difference. For
purposes of this Article, extraordinary income shall be understood to mean the
above described price difference multiplied by the number of oil barrels. The price
of crude oil as of the date of the contract used as a reference for the calculation of

companies to amend existing contracts, which was in line with constitutional and legal principles under Ecuadorian
law (Statement of Claim, footnote 169).

the difference shall be adjusted based on the United States Consumer Price Index
published by the Central Bank of Ecuador.

84. On 13 July 2006, President Gonzalez issued Decree No. 1672, which set the “additional
participation” at a minimum of 50%. Section 2 of Decree No. 1672 stated:

The State right to the surplus resulting from oil sale prices not agreed upon or
established in the participation Contracts for Hydrocarbon Exploration and Crude
Oil Exploitation entered into with the State of Ecuador through
PETROECUADOR shall amount to a minimum of 50% of extraordinary income
resulting from the difference between the monthly weighted average effective
[FOB] sale price of Ecuadorian oil by the contractor and the weighted average
monthly sale price on the date following execution of the above-mentioned
Participation Contracts, times the number of barrels produced by each contractor,
pursuant to the provisions set out in section 4 of these Replacing Regulations.

85. Just before Law 42 came into effect, Canam assigned its entire interest in the Consortium to
Murphy Ecuador.“ As of this date, therefore, Murphy Ecuador held a 20% interest in the
Consortium.

86. In May 2006, two claims were filed with Ecuador’s Constitutional Tribunal challenging the
constitutionality of Law 42.55 On 22 August 2006, the Constitutional Tribunal of Ecuador issued
a consolidated decision (“Joint Resolution”) upholding the constitutionality of Law 42.*°
G. The issuance of Decree No. 662 (“Law 42 at 99%”)

87. On 18 October 2007, the new President, Rafael Correa, issued Decree No. 662 under Law 42,

which increased the “additional participation” to a minimum of 99%:

88. Petroecuador started demanding payments under Law 42 from the Consortium members in 2006.**
From May 2006 to October 2007, the Consortium made payments pursuant to Law 42 and Decree
No. 1672, according to which the “additional participation” was set at 50%. From October 2007
to March 2008, the Consortium made payments pursuant to Law 42 and Decree No. 662 which

89. The Consortium initially paid the amounts under protest while reserving their rights. Repsol YPF
sent several letters to the Government stating that the payments had been made under protest and

The Ley de Equidad Tributaria created a 70% tax on profit or “extraordinary income” from the
sale of crude oil. This applied to all participation contracts, new or modified, entered into from 1
January 2008 onwards. The 70% tax would apply when the oil price exceeded a reference price
on which Petroecuador and the contractor were to agree. Once such an agreement had been
reached, Law 42 ceased to apply to the affected contract. Many oil companies signed modification
contracts in mid- to late-2008 with increased reference prices which had the effect of narrowing

what constituted “extraordinary income”.

93. Negotiations between the Consortium and Petroecuador commenced in January 2008 and lasted
until March 2008.” Repsol YPF, acting as Operator for the Consortium, represented all members
of the Consortium in the negotiations with each member being consulted in respect of all principal

decisions.” Approximately 40 meetings were held during this period.”

94. Not long into the negotiation process between the Consortium and Petroecuador, the following

report regarding President Correa’s views was published:

In Correa’s view, international oil companies have three options available in the
renegotiation process: to accept the 99-1 percent executive order, change their
contract model, or terminate their operations, in which case he undertakes to
reimburse them for the investments made, and the state owned oil company,
Petroecuador, will exploit the fields left by the oil companies.

The President said that if at the end of the term the renegotiation process is not
concluded or if the oil companies fail to invest, he will adopt “another kind of
measures.”

“My message to transnational companies is that Ecuador already has a
Government. They’d better be careful if they still believe they are operating under
the same conditions as they were before January 15, 2007,” he noted in reference
to the date when he took office.

He warned that he will not allow companies “to boycott oil production, or not
make investments, so that they may continue to enjoy the privileges they have
had in recent times.”**

On 3 March 2008, Murphy initiated ICSID proceedings under the Treaty against Ecuador.”

In late March 2008, Repsol and government representatives executed an acta to reflect economic
terms upon which, Respondent says, agreement had been reached in the context of negotiations
on the terms of a provisional modification contract to extend and replace the Participation Contract
until a new service contract could be agreed upon.'® No modification contract was concluded at

this time, however, and negotiations stalled.

On 9 June 2008, Murphy Ecuador, together with the other Block 16 Consortium members, initiated
a separate ICSID arbitration (“Repsol ICSID Arbitration”).'°' The Repsol ICSID Arbitration
involved the Block 16 Consortium members’ contract claims, and Repsol’s international law

investment claims under the Spain-Ecuador BIT."
In August 2008, Petroecuador and the Consortium agreed to recommence negotiations.’

In April and December 2008, President Correa was reported as acknowledging that one of his

tactics to obtain new terms and conditions under oil contracts with foreign companies included the

“tool of pressure” to force them to negotiate. '** He was later reported as saying:

and they were probably right [...]'

100. On 17 September 2008, the then-Minister of Mines and Petroleum sent to the Executive President
of Petroecuador an official communication requesting the initiation of the process for unilateral
termination of the Participation Contract, known as caducidad.'®° Notwithstanding the Minister's
request, the contract termination process was not initiated by the Executive President of

Petroecuador.'””

101.

On 29 October 2008, the new Minister of Mines and Petroleum sent to the Executive President of
Petroecuador a second request “that the early termination process [of the Participation Contract]
be initiated immediately.”! At the time, Ecuador conceded that this communication “was part of
a consistent practice by Respondent to reach mutually acceptable agreements with all of its
participation contractors, including [Murphy Ecuador] and its consortium partners, for the
voluntary termination of their contracts in return for new service provider contracts and buyouts
of their investments."

102. On 6 November 2008, a further acta was signed by all members of the Consortium—except
Murphy Ecuador—which, Respondent says, contained the terms and conditions of the future
contract that would modify the Participation Contract. Claimant argues that those terms and

conditions did not allow for the recovery of the Consortium’s benefits from the investment to

to accept the terms.

103. On 5 December 2008, Respondent approved the sale by Canam, the first-tier subsidiary of
Claimant, of its entire interest in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF.'” The actual sale was only

effected several months later on 12 March 2009.'3

104. Around this time (December 2008), Murphy Ecuador circulated an internal memorandum (“ME
Memo Dec. 2008”).'"* It addressed the possibility of an impairment for the investment in Block
16 as of year-end 2008, and several ways in which the company could recover its investment.
Among the various scenarios mentioned was the sale by Murphy Ecuador of its shareholding in

Block 16 to Repsol YPF. The memorandum stated the following:

Murphy has been in negotiations to sell its interest in Block 16/Tivacuno to
Repsol. The verbally agreed price is $80 million, with Murphy also keeping its
$83 million of unpaid Law 42 tax. An agreement has been drafted, but neither
party has signed the agreement at this time. Murphy’s board has been presented
with the progress of this negotiation, and if officially offered by Repsol has given
tentative approval to sell the field under these terms. The government of Ecuador
has tentatively approved the ownership transfer, but final authorization is pending
the agreement of the remaining owners to amend the contract as noted above, stop
furtherance of the arbitration proceedings, and possibly meeting other demands
such as payment of interest on unpaid Law 42 liabilities. Additionally, the
government is insisting that the new contract only allow most issues, including
tax and fiscal matters, to be brought before either Ecuadorian courts or a regional
arbitration tribunal based in Latin America. In order to sell our interest to Repsol,
the operator must obtain an agreeable contract renegotiation with the government,
which will include settlement of past Law 42 payments.

Led

Conclusion: Based on the information available, and primarily based on the
expectation that a sale to Repsol will occur at a price that will recover our
investment, and that our Law 42 liability exceeds our net book value, I conclude
that we are probable of recovering our investment in Block 16/Tivacuno.'*

105. On 19 February 2009, Petroecuador initiated what is known as a coactiva proceeding against the

Consortium. This is a process under which certain Ecuadorian agencies, of which Petroecuador is

Consortium owed Petroecuador USD 444,731,349.00.'!* Petroecuador issued a second writ of
payment on 20 February 2009 and a third writ of payment on 25 February 2009 for the same
amount.'!° As a result, Claimant and Repsol sought immediate provisional measures before their

20

respective ICSID Tribunals.

 

106. Faced with the imminent threat of seizure of its assets, Repsol tried to reach an agreement with
Ecuador. The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, in an official visit to Ecuador, mediated
between Repsol and the Government in an attempt to avoid the unilateral termination of the
Participation Contract and to find a mutually satisfactory solution to the dispute.'?!

107. Before any overdue Law 42 amounts were collected from the Consortium, Ecuador and Repsol
YPF reached an oral agreement to move forward with the signing of contractual arrangements,
and the coactiva proceedings were suspended.'” According to Claimant, the preliminary verbal
agreement reached on 25 February 2009 required a number of prerequisites to be resolved in a
short amount of time.'?? Murphy Ecuador did not agree with the proposed terms. Although the
Consortium members other than Murphy Ecuador had earlier signed the acta (or letter of intent)

with the government on 6 November 2008, the Participation Contract could not be amended

I. Murphy’s sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol

108. On 12 March 2009, Canam, the first-tier subsidiary of Claimant, sold its entire interest in Murphy
Ecuador to Repsol YPF pursuant to a Sale and Purchase Agreement (“SPA”).'*° The SPA
contained a clause that provided, inter alia, that “to the extent that certain rights or privileges of

5. Order, pursuant to Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, Claimant to pay all
costs and expenses of this arbitration proceeding, including the fees and expenses of

the Tribunal and the cost of the Republic’s legal representation, plus pre-award and

post-award interest thereon;'“* and,

6. Grant any other or additional relief as may be appropriate under circumstances or as
may otherwise be just and proper.'”

JURISDICTION

Respondent has raised a number of jurisdictional objections in these proceedings. Early on in the
case, Respondent argued that by Claimant's earlier election of ICSID arbitration, Claimant had
exhausted all opportunity afforded to it under Article VI of the Treaty to arbitrate its claims. That
objection was dismissed by a majority of this Tribunal in the Partial Award on Jurisdiction dated
13 November 2013. Respondent has also pleaded that Claimant’s claims should be precluded
because they are really those of its former shareholder Murphy Ecuador. That issue is addressed
in Section VIII of this Award. Respondent has also objected to Claimant’s claim under the so-
called “umbrella” clause of the Treaty. In light of this Tribunal’s finding on the merits, it is not

necessary for this Tribunal to address that issue.

 

P s ining juri i bjection to be by the Tribunal is based on

Article X of the Treaty.

125. Article X provides:

(1) With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness
and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the
other Party.

8

Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and
VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:

(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;

(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or

 

(c) the observance and of terms of an i Agreement or
authorization as referred to in Article VI(1)(a) or (b), to the extent they are
not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the
avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised
under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable
period of time.

A. Respondent’s Position

126. Respondent claims that Law 42 is a “matter of taxation” for the purposes of Article X of the
Treaty.'®° Therefore, with the exception of Claimant’s claim for expropriation, all of Claimant’s
claims that Ecuador breached its obligations under the Treaty are excluded from the Tribunal’s

Ist

jurisdiction.’ None of the other exceptions to the tax carve-out clause of Article X apply. The

Participation Contract does not constitute an investment agreement because Murphy Ecuador is a

Bermudan entity, not a U.S. entity.

127. Because the BIT does not define or limit the terms “matters of taxation” or “taxation” to measures
labelled as “taxes” under Ecuadorian or U.S. law,'*? Respondent alleges that the meaning of these

terms must be established based on their ordinary meaning and pursuant to international law.'*?

128. Respondent contends that a common definition of tax “is a mandatory levy imposed by the
government for public purposes, without any direct benefit to the taxpayer”.'** According to
Respondent, this definition is independent of domestic laws and accommodates the diversity of
legal systems. It also satisfies the requirement of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(“VCLT”) that undefined terms be given their ordinary meaning. '*° This definition has also been
embraced by other international tribunals; namely, Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of
Ecuador, EnCana v. Republic of Ecuador, and Duke Energy Electroquil Partners et al. v. Republic

of Ecuador Ecuador."

129. Respondent submits that the Burlington case addressed the precise question that this Tribunal must
address, i.e., whether Law 42 is a tax within the meaning of Article X of the US-Ecuador Treaty.'*”
That tribunal held that the Treaty is governed by international law, and as such the question must
be informed by international law, not Ecuadorian law.'** Applying international law, the
Burlington tribunal concluded that Law 42 is a tax for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty.'?
It also found that claimant’s claims that challenged Law 42 raised “matters of taxation” and thus
fell outside of the tribunal’s jurisdiction, while all of the claimant’s claims that did not challenge
the validity or enforcement of Law 42 were not precluded.'® In addition, the tribunal retained
jurisdiction over Claimant’s expropriation claim based on Law 42 pursuant to the Article X(2)(a)

exception.

130. Relying on EnCana, Respondent contends that the Tribunal must focus on the substance of a

measure rather than its label in determining whether the measure is a tax.'*! To that end, it notes

that the Burlington tribunal, which cited EnCana, rejected the argument that the domestic
characterisation of Law 42 meant that it was not a tax.' The heart of the Burlington tribunal’s
finding was that Law 42 satisfied four requirements for identifying a “matter of taxation”, i.e., it
is (1) a law (2) that imposes a liability on classes of persons (3) to pay money to the State (4) for

public purposes.’

131.

Respondent acknowledges that EnCana concerned the Canada-Ecuador BIT, the critical wording

of which was “taxation measure”, not “matter of taxation”.'“ Respondent claims that the concepts
of “taxation measure” in the Canada-Ecuador BIT and “matters of taxation” in the U.S. BIT are

indistinguishable.'®

132. Respondent relies on the EnCana tribunal’s holding that “[t]he question whether something is a
tax measure is primarily a question of its legal operation, not its economic effect”.'“ Respondent
explains that the “legal operation” of a tax law refers to how it “imposes a liability on classes of
persons to pay money to the State for public purposes”.'®’ In view of this, Respondent argues that
a measure’s link to a State’s internal tax regime is unnecessary.'® It submits that its position
accords with EnCana in that it respects the purpose of a tax carve-out clause which is to protect

the State’s power to raise revenues for public purposes.’

133. Respondent does not accept that EnCana, as well as Duke Energy—which Respondent says also
adopted a broad definition of “tax”—are distinguishable from this case because both dealt with

measures that were “clearly part of the Ecuadorian tax regime”.'” Respondent clarifies that neither

tribunal expressly concluded that tax carve-outs applied only if the internal tax regimes defined

the relevant measure as a “tax”.'7!

134. Respondent argues that Law 42 functioned as an income tax by imposing a compulsory liability

ona select group of persons or companies.'” It submits that Law 42’s history and purpose supports
its characterisation as a tax.'"* It notes that Law 42 was enacted to enable Ecuadorian citizens to

benefit from allegedly “windfall” oil profits!

135. Respondent explains that Law 42 was enacted through an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law
rather than through tax legislation because of its “urgent economic nature”.'> Respondent points
out, however, that the Ley de Equidad Tributaria, which replaced Law 42 (including Decree 662),
was enacted pursuant to procedures for tax measures.' Respondent characterises the Ley de

Equidad Tributaria as a natural continuation or replacement of Law 42 because it operated

1177

similarly by imposing a fixed percent levy on the extraordinary income from oil,’ and applied to

all “modified” participation contracts.'* Respondent also notes the availability of coactiva—a
special administrative procedure for forcibly collecting debt owed to the Ecuadorian

government—for collecting debt under Law 42, is reminiscent of tax collection procedures.'”

136. Even if Law 42 were not a tax under Ecuadorian law, Respondent states that it could implicate a
“matter of taxation”.'® It notes that the tribunal in Occidental Petroleum Corporation and

Occidental Exploration and Production Company yv. Republic of Ecuador (“Occidental IT’)'*'

accepted that a State measure although not ‘a tax, a royalty [or] a levy’ under domestic law, may

wo182

nonetheless raise a ‘matter of taxation’ for purposes of Article X of the Treaty.

137. Respondent states that the plain meaning of Article X of the BIT belies Claimant’s restrictive view

that the term “matters of taxation” covers only measures that are part of the tax regime of the

Contracting State.'**

Such an interpretation, Respondent argues, leads to an inconsistent

application of the tax carve-out provision of Article X to substantially similar measures, based

solely on whether they are labelled a “tax” domestically.'** Respondent contends that Claimant

has acknowledged that Law 42 is in substance a “tax” by stating that the “result” of Law 42 “could

have been achieved simply by levying oil companies with a tax”.'*°

138. The commentary to Article X in the U.S. Submittal Letter to the BIT states that “tax matters are
generally excluded from the coverage of the prototype BIT, based on the assumption that tax
matter[s] are properly covered in bilateral tax treaties.”!*° Respondent confirms that Ecuador and
the U.S.A. have not entered into a bilateral tax treaty.'*’ Respondent adds that even if there were

such a treaty, the range of tax matters that would be covered by the BIT—and excluded by Article

X—would be much broader than the range covered by a tax treaty.'** Respondent argues that while
BITs can cover the entire range of effects (both direct and indirect) flowing from all measures of
taxation that violate substantive BIT protections, tax treaties are designed to address a much
narrower range of taxes, like double taxation and tax evasion.'*? This is demonstrated, Respondent
argues, by the fact that the U.S. Submittal Letter expressly states that the three exceptions to the

Article X tax carve-out are “not typically addressed in tax treaties.”!°” There would be no need for

the three exceptions if “matters of taxation” were limited to those covered by tax treaties.'"!

Further, tax treaties usually define the specific kinds of taxes to which they are designed to apply

whereas BITs do not.'**

139. Respondent submits that like BITs, bilateral tax treaties emphasise the nature, rather than the label
or legislative origin, of the measure at issue.’ In this way, Respondent argues that tax treaties
support the approach taken by the tribunals in EnCana, Duke Energy, and Burlington, of looking
at what a measure actually does to assess whether or not it is a tax.'*4 As such, Respondent submits
that, notwithstanding that it was enacted as an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law, Law 42
would fall within the coverage of typical tax treaties since it imposed a levy on income achieved
from the sale of crude oil.!* It argues that the classification of a measure under the vocabulary of
domestic legislation as a tax measure is irrelevant under both tax treaties and BITs.'°°

140. Respondent rejects Claimant’s assertion that Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) and
umbrella clause claims do not directly challenge the enactment or validity of Law 42.'”

“matter of taxation” while the application or enforcement of a tax measure would not be a “matter
of taxation.”'* Respondent objects to Claimant’s argument that its FET and umbrella clause
claims are based upon Ecuador’s failure to compensate it for violations of provisions of the
Participation Contract rather than on the enforcement of Law 42.' Respondent argues that the
enforcement of a tax measure is predicate to any right to compensation to begin with, thus the

distinction drawn by Claimant is of no assistance.”

B. Claimant’s Position

Claimant argues that Article X applies only when “matters of taxation” are involved in the dispute,
and given that Law 42 is not a tax—either under Ecuadorian or international law—it cannot be
considered a “matter of taxation” for the purposes of Article X of the BIT." As such, Claimant’s

claims are not excluded from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Claimant argues that under Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the BIT must be interpreted “in accordance
with the ordinary meaning” of its terms, and, absent a specific definition in the BIT, the term
“matters of taxation” cannot be expanded to cover matters that do not fall within the respective
tax regimes of the Contracting States.” As Law 42 was enacted outside the scope of the
Ecuadorian tax regime, it cannot be considered a tax under any other purportedly applicable law.?
Murphy argues that the BIT should be interpreted “in the light of its object and purpose”, which
is the promotion and protection of covered investments." Any concerns to protect the State’s

power to raise revenues through taxation cannot override the clear terms of the BIT.

Claimant claims that the EnCana, Duke Energy, Occidental II and Burlington cases are

distinguishable and do not support Respondent’s case.

144. First, Claimant clarifies that EnCana was brought under the Canada-Ecuador BIT, not the US-
Ecuador BIT.” The dispute was whether VAT refunds were excluded by the tax carve-out. While
the Canada-Ecuador BIT does not define “taxation measures,” it does define “measures” as “any
law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.” In light of the broad definition of
“measures”, the EnCana tribunal held that there was no reason to limit the tax carve out to “actual
provisions of the law which impose a tax” but that it should also include “all those aspects of the
tax regime which go to determine how much tax is payable or refundable”.””’ The tribunal found
that the term “taxation” included indirect taxes such as VAT.** The tribunal also stated that “a
measure is a taxation measure if it is part of the regime for the imposition of a tax.””” Given that
the measure in dispute in EnCana was part of the Ecuadorian tax regime, Murphy argues that
EnCana does not support the argument that the term “taxation” should be interpreted as including
laws that are not part of the Ecuadorian tax regime.”"°

145. Second, Claimant submits that Duke Energy does not support Ecuador’s broad interpretation of
the term “taxation”.*!! The tribunal in Duke Energy considered the EnCana ruling to be relevant
and deemed that the measure at issue, an exemption from customs duties, was a tax? The
measure fell under the Ecuadorian tax regime whereas Law 42 did not.?"?

146. Third, Claimant submits that while the Burlington tribunal correctly stated that an international
treaty is governed by international law, it failed to acknowledge that domestic law is a “key
element” to establish whether a measure like Law 42 forms part of Ecuador’s taxation regime.”!*
Murphy avers that the Burlington tribunal did not apply the test in EnCana, which is that “the

question whether something is a tax measure is primarily a question of its legal operation not its

economic effect.”*!5 Claimant also asserts that the Burlington tribunal failed to acknowledge that

not all payments made to a government are taxes, even though they may have been enacted by law

for alleged public purposes.”'° Claimant argues that the Burlington tribunal disregarded the title
and express terms of Law 42 which show that it was enacted to increase Ecuador’s share in the
participation contracts.”!”

147. Fourth, Claimant points out that the Occidental II tribunal held that Law 42 could not be
considered a tax under the participation contract at issue.”!* It stated that “[flor purposes of
characterising Law 42, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude [...] that the participation of
Ecuador under Law 42 ‘in surplus from oils sales prices not agreed upon or foreseen,’ is neither a

royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the Participation Contract.

Claimant argues that while it does not govern this dispute, Ecuadorian law “is relevant as a matter
of fact.””° To that end, Murphy submits that it is right to look to Ecuadorian law for the proper
characterisation of a measure such as Law 42 for purposes of applying Article X of the BIT.”
This, Claimant argues, is what the EnCana tribunal did when it found that all aspects related to
VAT were covered by the term “taxation measures”. It is also what the Duke Energy tribunal did
when it found that the exemption from customs duties was instituted by law and thus part of the

222

taxation legislation.~* These two tribunals did not resort to international law, or any other

legislation apart from Ecuadorian law, to make those determinations.

149. Claimant alleges that Law 42 is not a tax under Ecuadorian law or the Participation Contract
because it was not enacted through procedures that apply to tax measures, as Respondent has
acknowledged.” Even the Office of the Attorney-General of Ecuador allegedly said that Law 42
was not a tax.?”* Claimant asserts that Respondent could have enacted Law 42 as a tax, but did not
do so in order to circumvent the Participation Contract’s economic stability clause.””> In addition,
Claimant submits that Ecuador did not enact Law 42 to serve a public purpose, but rather to
pressure oil companies into modifying their participation contracts to a more favourable

arrangement for Ecuador.”

150. While acknowledging that the economic effects of Law 42 on the Participation Contract mirror
those of a tax, Claimant reiterates that the classification of a measure as a tax depends on its legal
operation, not its economic effect.?”’ Claimant submits that Law 42 could not be considered to be
taxing real income let alone windfall profits, and nor did it exhibit “substantial” elements of a

tax.

151.

Claimant argues that Law 42 can be contrasted with the Ley de Equidad Tributaria which
constitutes tax legislation that is part of the Ecuadorian tax regime.””” The difference between the
two laws shows that Law 42 is not and never was part of Ecuador’s tax regime.” The Ley de

Equidad Tributaria “was enacted in accordance with procedures for taxation measures”**! and

states explicitly that it “creates” a “tax on extraordinary income”.?” Claimant disagrees with
Respondent's assertion that the Ley de Equidad Tributaria replaces, or, is a natural continuation

of, Law 42. That is belied, Claimant says, by the fact that Law 42 is still in force today."

152. Further, Claimant submits that the enactment of Law 42 as a purported “urgent economic measure”
has no bearing on whether or not it is a tax.

153. Even if Law 42 were a tax, Claimant submits that Article X(2) is only triggered if Claimant’s
claims “raise” “matters of taxation”.”** For that to be the case, Ecuador argues that Murphy’s

claims must “relate to the legality of Law 42 under the Treaty.”?*° Claimant says that it does not
contest Law 42 per se and its claims do not challenge the enactment of Law 42,7 or Law 42’s
status under Ecuadorian or international law, or Ecuador’s taxation powers.” Rather, Claimant
avers that it is challenging the application or enforcement of Law 42 to the Participation
Contract.” Specifically, Claimant submits that Ecuador’s enforcement of Law 42 violated the

guarantees and protections provided for in the Participation Contract, including the following:

[the] exclusive ownership of the Consortium’s participation (Clause 3.3.5) and its
right to sell it at market prices (Clause 10.1); the specific formula agreed-to by
the Parties, which deliberately excludes the price of oil from the calculation of
each Party’s respective share, which is based exclusively on production volumes
(Clause 8.1 through 8.5); the legal stability set forth in Clause 22.1 in accordance
with Article 7.18 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code; the prohibition against unilateral
modification provided for in Clause 15.2; and, subsidiarily and in the alternative,
the need to preserve the economic stability of the contract provided for in Clauses
8.6 and 11.11.%°

effects of Law 42 did not constitute a challenge to the law itself.7'

155. Claimant confirms that Ecuador has not signed a bilateral tax treaty with the United States.” It

adds that Ecuador’s bilateral tax treaties or double taxation agreements with other States do not

 

deal with general matters of taxation but instead address specific issues on the avoidance of double

taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion.”

In any event, Claimant argues that even if there
were a bilateral tax treaty between Ecuador and the United States, it would not be relevant because
Murphy’s claims in this arbitration do not involve “matters of taxation.”*“ This is so because not
only was Law 42 not enacted within the Ecuadorian tax regime, but also because Murphy’s claims

do not directly challenge the validity or legality of Law 42.4

C. Analysis of the Tribunal

156. Article X of the Treaty provides in its entirety:

(1) With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness
and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the
other Party.

Q

Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and
VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:

(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;
(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or

(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment Agreement
or authorization as referred to in Article VI(1)(a) or (b), to the extent they
are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the
avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised
under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable
period of time."
157. Article X is a tax carve-out clause similar to many found in bilateral investment treaties. It
excludes from international supervision the Contracting States’ powers to legislate taxes. The

question before this Tribunal is whether Law 42 is properly considered a “matter of taxation”

under Article X of the Treaty. If it is, this Tribunal would not have jurisdiction over Claimant’s
claims, unless one of the three exceptions in Article X(2) were to apply. The main point of
difference between the Parties is the extent to which the domestic characterisation of Law 42—
ie., that it is a change to the Hydrocarbons Law, not a tax law—should be taken into account when
deciding whether Law 42 is a “matter of taxation” for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty.

Claimant says Law 42’s domestic characterisation is relevant; Respondent says it is not.

The Treaty does not define “matters of taxation” or “taxation”. As it is an instrument of
international law, the term must be interpreted in accordance with international law. Article 31(1)
of the VCLT provides that: “A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object
and purpose.” Article 31(1) contains separate principles that are to be applied simultaneously:
interpretation in good faith; recourse to the ordinary meaning; and that the ordinary meaning is

not to be determined in the abstract but in context and in light of the treaty’s object and purpose.”

Ordinary Meaning

Turning first to the ordinary meaning, the Tribunal notes that both Parties accept the observation
made by the EnCana tribunal that a “taxation law” is one which imposes a liability on classes of
persons to pay money to the State for public purposes. It is also uncontested that “tax” ordinarily
means a mandatory levy imposed by the government for public purposes, without any direct
benefit to the taxpayer. The latter definition identifies an additional element that there is no direct
benefit to the taxpayer, which this Tribunal accepts as part of the ordinary meaning. Considering
the essential elements of a tax as identified by the Parties and other tribunals, this Tribunal
considers that the ordinary meaning of a “matter of taxation” is a matter related to the imposition
of a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes and without any

direct benefit to the taxpayer.
Context of the Treaty

The Tribunal turns next to the context by reference to which the term “matters of taxation” must

be interpreted. “Context” includes the other terms of Article X as well as the remainder of the

Treaty.>4*

161.

The first clause in Article X exhorts each Contracting State, with respect to its tax policies, to
strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investments of nationals and companies of
the other State. Following this exhortation is the provision excluding matters of taxation from the
dispute settlement clauses of the Treaty. The Tribunal determines that the reference to the
Contracting States’ “tax policies” in Article X(1) is pertinent to the question of whether the
domestic characterisation of a measure should be considered in the interpretation of the term
“matters of taxation”. Article X(1) provides context in reference to which Article X(2) should be
interpreted. A State’s domestic tax regime is the manifestation of its tax policies. When the
Tribunal interprets the term “matters of taxation” under Article X(2), it should therefore take into
account the domestic tax regime that is the legislative and regulatory manifestation of its tax
policies. Even though the domestic characterisation of a law is not decisive in the treaty context,
it is a strong indication as to how the law should be characterized. A tribunal would be remiss if,
in interpreting Article X(2) of the Treaty, it paid no regard to the characterisation of the measure

under the domestic tax regime.

162. The final paragraph of Article X refers to a “Convention for the avoidance of double taxation
between the two Parties.” The commentary in the U.S. Submittal Letter states that “tax matters”
are generally excluded from the coverage of the prototype BIT based on the assumption that “tax.
matters” are properly covered in bilateral tax treaties. This suggests that the content of bilateral
tax treaties informs the interpretation of “matters of taxation”. It also states that “two of the three
expropriatory taxation and tax provisions contained in an investment agreement or authorization
are not typically addressed in tax treaties.” This suggests that there are “taxation and tax
provisions” that are not typically covered by bilateral tax treaties but that could be considered

“matters of taxation” under the Treaty.

163. Ecuador and the U.S. have not concluded a bilateral tax treaty. The Parties agree that most bilateral
tax treaties typically cover matters of double taxation or tax evasion. Whereas Claimant submits
that bilateral tax treaties are generally limited to these discrete categories of tax matters,”
Respondent argues that while they often include a list of specific tax laws, those lists are not

exhaustive, and more general measures related to taxes on income and capital are also covered.”*°

The Tribunal finds that the reference in Article X to a bilateral tax treaty is inconclusive in terms
of assisting in the interpretation of “matters of taxation”. Bilateral tax treaties typically concern
issues of double taxation and fiscal evasion. However, other matters exist that may be considered

taxation matters but that are not covered by bilateral tax treaties.

Object and Purpose of the Treaty

Finally the Tribunal turns to the object and purpose of the Treaty, as relevant to the interpretation
of “matters of taxation”. The object and purpose of the Treaty as a whole is to promote greater
economic cooperation between the parties and investment by nationals of one party in the territory

of the other.**! The purpose of Article X specifically is to preserve the State:

 

overeignty in
relation to their power to impose taxes in their territory. Most governments view these powers as
a central element of sovereignty. Therefore, while they may be willing to accept international
discipline over State conduct, they are reluctant to accept such oversight as regards their powers
of taxation. This has led most State parties to modern investment treaties to omit taxation from a

treaty’s ambit, or restrict the treaty’s application to certain types of taxes.”

The Tribunal finds that, for it to assess whether a measure is one which was meant to be excluded
from an international arbitral tribunal’s purview because it concerns a State’s sovereign power of
taxation, it is necessary for the Tribunal to examine whether that measure comes within the State’s

domestic tax regime.

The Parties agree that Law 42 was not enacted under Ecuadorian tax legislation.?*? Rather, it was
an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law.” Law 42 was promulgated under Article 155 of the
Ecuadorian Constitution which provides the President with powers to submit emergency draft
legislation regarding economic matters to Congress, at which point the draft laws must be
approved, modified, or tabled within 30 days of submission to the legislative branch, or pass as is.
Law 42 reformed the Hydrocarbons Law by changing and inserting standards into it. Article 1

substituted Article 44 and Article 2 inserted an unnumbered article after Article 55.7° By contrast,

Article 147 of the Ecuadorian Constitution applies to the creation, modification, or removal of tax

laws. It stipulates that only the President can submit draft tax laws to Congress.

At the time of Law 42’s enactment, high-ranking government officials said that it was not a tax.
The then-current Attorney General, Dr. José Maria Borja Gallegos, stated before Ecuador’s

Constitutional Tribunal on 12 July 2006 that:

[t]o state that ‘All the elements of a tax can be found without difficulties in Art.

2 of [Law 42]’ is absolutely irrational [...]. In this case it is very clear that [Law

42] is not a tax law, not only because it lacks a tax law’s constitutive elements,

but also because given its character as a law amending a principal law, it receives

the same treatment as the latter, and the Hydrocarbons Law is not in any way a

tax law.”?°°
The current Attorney General of Ecuador, Dr. Diego Garcia Carrién, also stated before Ecuador’s
Constitutional Tribunal on 12 July 2006 that Law 42 “is not a Tax Law, neither does it create nor
does it modify any tax or tribute”.?*”
That Law 42 did not come within the Ecuadorian tax regime is further demonstrated by the
difference between its enactment and that of the Ley de Equidad Tributaria. The latter was enacted
in accordance with a chapter of the Ecuadorian Tax Code and formed part of a wider reform of
Ecuador’s national tax system.?** It states explicitly that it “creates” a “tax on extraordinary
income”, also known as the “Windfall Income Tax”.*?
The Parties have referred to the findings of several tribunals established under investment treaties
that have examined whether legal measures taken by Ecuador, including Law 42, ought properly

to be considered tax measures under Ecuadorian law and/or international law.

One of these cases is the EnCana case, commenced in March 2003 pursuant to the Canada-
Ecuador BIT. Article XII(1) of that treaty provides that “nothing in this Agreement shall apply to

taxation measures.” While the treaty does not define taxation or taxation measures, it does contain

50% of the “extraordinary income” arising from the price difference between the then prevailing oil price and the
oil price prevailing at the date the participation contracts were concluded, multiplied by the number of oil barrels.

a broad definition of the word “measure” as including “any law, regulation, procedure,

requirement or practice”.

The EnCana case concerned claims for VAT refunds arising out of contracts for the exploration
and exploitation of oil and gas reserves in Ecuador.” The claimant impugned measures taken by
Ecuadorian tax authorities that sought to deny tax credits and refunds to oil companies.”"! The

respondent argued that the claim was inextricably associated with a “taxation measure” and
therefore excluded from the scope of the BIT’s dispute settlement provisions (except for

expropriation). The tribunal agreed.

The tribunal held that the term “taxation measures” should be given its normal meaning in the

context of the treaty. It made the following observations:

 

(1) It is in the nature of a tax that it is imposed by law. [...] The Tribunal is not
a court of appeal in Ecuadorian tax matters, and provided a matter is
sufficiently clearly connected to a taxation law or regulation (or to a
procedure, requirement or practice of the taxation authorities in apparent
reliance on such a law or regulation), then its legality is for the courts of the
host State.

There is no reason to limit the term “taxation” to direct taxation. [...] Thus
indirect taxes such as VAT are included.

2

(6)

Having regard to the breadth of the defined term “measure”, there is no
reason to limit Article XII(1) to the actual provisions of the law which
impose a tax. All those aspects of the tax regime which go to determine how
much tax is payable or refundable are part of the notion of “taxation
measures”. Thus tax deductions, allowances or rebates are caught by the
term.

4

The question whether something is a tax measure is primarily a question of
its legal operation, not its economic effect. A taxation law is one which
imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public
purposes. The economic impacts or effects of tax measures may be unclear
and debatable; nonetheless a measure is a taxation measure if it is part of the
regime for the imposition of a tax. [...}°*

When the EnCana tribunal interpreted the tax carve-out provision of the Canada-Ecuador BIT, it

examined Ecuador’s domestic legal tax regime.” It was clear from that analysis that, unlike Law

42, the impugned measures in EnCana were part of the Ecuadorian tax regime. The question
before the EnCana tribunal was whether the term “taxation measures” was broad enough to
include indirect taxes. There was no dispute that the measures were enacted within the tax regime;
demands were made on the claimant by tax officials. The tribunal held that “all those aspects of
the tax regime which go to determine how much tax is payable or refundable are part of the notion

of ‘taxation measures”. There is thus a significant difference between the issue before the EnCana
tribunal and the question before this Tribunal. This Tribunal must assess whether a measure is a
matter of taxation under Article X notwithstanding that it was not enacted as a tax or otherwise

part of the national tax regime.

The Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador (“Occidental I’)?
and Duke Energy cases also involved measures that were enacted within the Ecuadorian tax
regime. Occidental I involved the same measures as EnCana—V AT reimbursements—and Duke
Energy involved exemptions from customs duties.” These cases are therefore of limited
assistance given that, unlike the measures at issue in them, Law 42 was enacted outside of the
Ecuadorian tax regime. What is notable, however, is that in both of these cases, as in EnCana, the
tribunals examined the domestic tax regime when assessing whether the measure fell within the

treaty’s tax carve-out provision.

The Burlington tribunal was the first to determine whether Law 42 constituted a “matter of
taxation” under Article X(2) of the US-Ecuador Treaty. The tribunal was of the view—and the
parties had presupposed the same view—that there could be “matters of taxation” under Article X
only if there was a tax within the meaning of that provision.* Accordingly, the tribunal examined

whether Law 42 was a tax for the purpos

 

of Article X of the Treaty. In its Decision on
Jurisdiction of 2 June 2010, the tribunal held that the question whether Law 42 constituted a tax
for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty was a question of international law, not Ecuadorian

law:

[...] the question whether Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X is governed
by international law, not by Ecuadorian law.

Therefore, for the purposes of jurisdiction, the Tribunal needs only to decide
whether Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X of the Treaty under international

law. In other words, there is no point in the tribunal determining at this stage
whether Law 42 is a tax under Ecuadorian law.”°
178. The Burlington tribunal applied the tax definition in EnCana and Duke Energy, i.e., that the
measure constitutes a tax if the following four requirements are met: (1) there is a law;
(2) that imposes liability on classes of persons; (3) to pay money to the State; (4) for public
purposes.””” The tribunal held that under this definition, Law 42 constituted a tax for the purposes
of Article X of the Treaty.?’! It then examined whether Burlington’s claims “raised” matters of
taxation within the meaning of the Treaty. The parties had agreed that a dispute “raises ‘matters
of taxation’ whenever an investor challenges the validity or enforcement of a tax.””” The tribunal
concluded that some of the claimant’s claims challenged the validity or enforcement of Law 42
and were thus excluded from the tribunal’s jurisdiction, whereas other claims did not and thus

came within the tribunal’s jurisdiction.

179. The Occidental II tribunal constituted under the U.S.-Ecuador Treaty assessed whether Law 42
was properly characterized as a tax. It asked whether Law 42 was: “a tax, a royalty, a levy or, more

generally, a ‘matter of taxation’ under the Treaty, or [...] something else?”.?™

180. The Occidental IT tribunal noted that at the quantum hearing, Ecuador had for the first time argued
that Law 42 was a “matter of taxation” for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty. At the same

hearing, Ecuador had also stated that Law 42 was not a tax:

488. There is also a compelling procedural reason why the Tribunal must
characterize Law 42. At the Hearing on Quantum, the Respondent, for the
first time in these proceedings, claimed that “the question of Law 42 is
excluded from the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction in accordance with Article
10 of [the] Treaty”. In effect, as will be seen, the Respondent was now
adopting the position that Law 42 was a “matter of taxation.”

489.The Tribunal recalls that the Respondent, throughout the Hearing on
Quantum, was loath to characterize Law 42. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the
Respondent stated categorically that Law 42 was not a royalty.

490. The Tribunal also recalls that at the Hearing on Quantum, the Respondent
submitted categorically that Law 42 “is not a tax”. In the words of counsel
for Ecuador:

“[I]n Ecuador [...] for a tax to be created and imposed on the
citizens, you need to follow some special procedures in the
constitution. Here, this Law 42 was issued pursuant to a different
procedure. So it couldn’t be a tax.”

The Occidental IT tribunal held that Law 42 was not a tax:

495. The Tribunal [...] agrees with the Respondent that Law 42 is not a tax.
Again, such a characterization is contrary to the plain text of Law 42 and, in
any event, as stressed by the Respondent, it was not “created” in accordance
with the Ecuadorian Constitution.
The tribunal characterized Law 42 rather as “a unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to
allocate to the Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of the revenues earned by contractor
companies such as OEPC that hold participation contract[s].”’” While it is clear that the
Occidental II tribunal did not consider Law 42 to be tax under Ecuadorian law, the tribunal did
not explicitly state whether it considered Law 42 to be a “matter of taxation” under the Treaty. It
found that the claimant fell within the Article X(2)(c) “investment agreement” exception to the

Treaty’s tax carve-out.

By contrast, the tribunal in Perenco Ecuador Limited v. The Republic of Ecuador (“Perenco”),””°
constituted under the France-Ecuador BIT, held that Law 42 was a tax under Ecuadorian law (and
thus triggered the taxation modification clauses of the underlying contracts). That tribunal held
that while the evidence went both ways, on balance, and having regard to “its economic effect, the
fact that it mandated the payment of monies to the State in accordance with a specified formula,
and Perenco’s contemporaneous characterization of Law 42 as a tax to which the taxation
modification clauses of the Contracts applied, the Tribunal consider[ed] that Law 42 should be

treated as a taxation measure.”?””

One element that weighed in favour of the tribunal’s conclusion in this case was the fact that the
claimant Perenco Ecuador Limited had characterized Law 42 as a tax at the time it was enacted.
That element is not present in this case. Neither Murphy, Murphy Ecuador, nor the other

Consortium members contemporaneously characterized Law 42 as a tax. To the contrary, they

believed that Law 42 was not a tax at the time it was enacted which is why, at the time, they did

not invoke clauses 8.6 (economic stability) or 11.11 (modification of the tax regime and the labour
profit sharing) of the Participation Contract.”

185. For the reasons set forth at paragraphs 167 to 170 above, this Tribunal concludes that Law 42 did

not constitute a tax under Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal is of the view that while the domestic

characterisation of a measure is not determinative at international law, it provides a strong

indication of the measure’s proper characterisation.

186. Respondent has argued that notwithstanding that Law 42 was not enacted as tax legislation per se,
it carried all of the conceptual characteristics of a tax, i.e., it required (1) payment of money
unilaterally required by the State; (2) in order to obtain resources and for public expenditures; (3)
in exercise of the State’s absolute power required, even under compulsion; (4) by virtue of the
law.?” It contends that it should thus be considered a “matter of taxation” for the purposes of the

Treaty.

187. Respondent relies on the guidelines for the definition of “tax” given by the EnCana tribunal, i-e.,
a measure that imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public
purposes. It argues that Law 42 satisfies the EnCana test because it instituted a fixed levy—called
“additional participation”—on the extraordinary income generated by oil sales.’*” The additional
participation was compulsory and applied to a select group of persons.”*! It was collected on a

282

mandatory basis and entered Ecuador’s treasury.** Its purpose was to “promote public welfare by

allowing the Republic [...] to provide its people with the benefit of the unprecedented increase in
oil prices.”
188. The Tribunal agrees that notwithstanding that Law 42 was clearly enacted outside of the

Ecuadorian tax regime, it is necessary to examine whether it may nevertheless be considered a

matter of taxation at international law for the purposes of Article X(2). In order to assess this, the

Tribunal shall examine its legal operation.**

189. Law 42 operated similarly to a tax in that it imposed economic burdens (50% and later 99% of
additional participation) upon a class of persons (contractors with participation contracts for oil
exploration and exploitation in Ecuador) to pay money to the State, ostensibly for public purposes
(to allocate a larger share in revenues derived from the country’s natural resources to its citizens
via State expenditure) without there being any direct benefit to the taxpayer. Law 42 and the

subsequent Ley de Equidad Tributaria had similar effects.

190. Notwithstanding these similarities, the Tribunal holds that, taking into account all circumstances,
the more accurate characterisation of Law 42’s operation is that it was not a tax, or a matter of
taxation at international law, but a unilateral change by the State to the terms of the participation
contracts that were governed by the Hydrocarbons Law.”** The stated purpose of the law was to
amend certain oil contracts held by certain oil companies, all of which were foreign companies.”*°

The obligation to pay 50% in additional participation stemmed from the contractual obligations in

the participation contracts. The revenue earned by the State under Law 42 was classified as non-

tax revenue.”*’ After the enforcement of Law 42, Ecuador’s “non-tax” revenue from hydrocarbon
exploitation increased, while the contractors’ decreased, essentially modifying the participation

formula in the contracts.

191.

The Tribunal further observes that not every mandatory payment made by a class of persons to the

State for public purposes without direct benefit is necessarily a tax. For example, certain types of

28 EnCana Award, para, 142(4), CLA-79.

285 See supra, para. 182. This was also the conclusion reached by the tribunal in Occidental II Award, paras. 509

and 525, CLA-117:
“509. For purposes of characterizing Law 42, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude, as it now
does, that the participation of Ecuador under Law 42 ‘in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed
upon or not foreseen,’ is neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the
Participation Contract.
[1
525, [...] the Tribunal finds that with the introduction of Law 42, the Respondent modified
unilaterally and in a substantial way the contractual and legal framework that existed at the time the
Claimants negotiated and agreed the Participation Contract and thereby violated Clauses 5.3.2 and
8.1 of the Participation Contract.”

fines, fees, or special contributions may be required payments to the government but not constitute

a tax.°

In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Law 42 does not constitute a “matter of taxation”
for the purposes of Article X(2) of the Treaty so as to preclude this Tribunal’s jurisdiction over

Claimant’s non-expropriation claims.
MERITS

Claimant claims that Ecuador has breached (1) the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty;
(2) the so-called “umbrella” clause found at Article II(3)(c); (3) the obligation of full protection
and security at Article II(3)(a); (4) the obligation of non-impairment through arbitrary measures
found at Article II(3)(b); and (5) the provision against unlawful expropriation at Article III(1) of

the Treaty.

The Tribunal turns first to Claimant’s claim for breach of the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of

the Treaty.

1. Whether the fair and equitable treatment standard under the Treaty exceeds the scope
of the customary international law minimum standard

A. Claimant’s Position

Claimant argues that Respondent violated the FET standard under Article II(3)(a) of the BIT,
which states that “[iJnvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall
enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required
by international law”.?”

Claimant states that the FET standard requires a host State to: (1) “protect and observe an
investor’s legitimate expectations;” (2) “ensure the stability and predictability of the legal and
business framework;” (3) “act consistently and transparently towards the investor and its
investment;” and (4) “act in good faith and treat the investor and its investment free from coercion

and harassment”.”” Claimant argues that Respondent has breached each of these requirements.

B. Respondent’s Position

199. Respondent argues that Article II(3)(a) of the BIT reflects the Contracting States’ customary

international law obligation, which is the international minimum standard,” and does not

prescribe an autonomous fixed standard or an “ever expanding catalog of constituent elements”.””°

200. Respondent notes that Article II(3)(a) neither defines the term “fair and equitable” nor refers to
any of Claimant’s FET “components”.””” Respondent argues that Claimant has the burden of

showing that the “components” it cites form part of customary international law.?*

201.

Respondent submits that Article II(3)(a) does not state that the FET standard is “independent from”
the international minimum standard.” That the FET standard only refers to the international

minimum standard is, Respondent alleges, well-established in case law.”

204. Respondent asks the Tribunal to accord deference to Ecuador’s regulatory prerogative, as required

by international law and as implicit in the international minimum standard.

C. Analysis of the Tribunal

205. The Parties dispute the extent to which Article II(3)(a) of the BIT represents an autonomous treaty

standard that is distinct from the standard established under customary international law.

206. This debate is more theoretical than substantial. It is clear from the repeated reference to “fair and
equitable” treatment in investment treaties and arbitral awards that the FET treaty standard is now

such as:

generally accepted as reflecting p p . a
stability, predictability, conduct in good faith and the fulfilment of an investor’s legitimate

: >° The precise application of these comp: and the stringency of the standard
applicable, may vary from case to case depending on the terms of the clause and the specific
circumstances of the case. Notwithstanding, the function of the FET clause in investment treaties
is broadly the same: it ensures the stability and predictability of the legal and business framework
in the State party subject to any qualifications otherwise established by the treaty and under
international law.**” Moreover, as articulated by the Occidental / tribunal, also referring to the US-
Ecuador BIT, the treaty’s FET standard “is an objective requirement that does not depend on
whether the Respondent has proceeded in good faith or not”.

207. Protecting the stability and predictability of the host State’s legal and business framework also
underpins the modern customary international law standard.*”? The CMS Gas Transmission

Corporation v. Argentine Republic*'® tribunal, for example, decided that “the Treaty standard of
fair and equitable treatment and its connection with the required stability and predictability of the

business environment, founded on solemn legal and contractual commitments, is not different

from the international law minimum standard and its evolution under customary law.”*!! Other
tribunals interpreting the customary international law obligation have repeatedly embraced a less
stringent standard and have emphasised that they were dealing with an evolving concept that
embraces the application and interpretation of the treaty FET standard.’!? The Mondev

International Ltd. v. United States of America’

tribunal interpreted the Free Trade Commission
statement regarding the content and standard of Article 1105 of NAFTA as “incorporating current
international law, whose content is shaped by the conclusions of more than two thousand bilateral
investment treaties and many treaties of friendship and commerce. Those treaties largely and
concordantly provide for ‘fair and equitable’ treatment of, and for ‘full protection and security”
for, the foreign investor and his investments”.*!* The ADF Group Inc. v. United States of
America®" tribunal, affirming the observations made in Mondey, stated further that the constantly
evolving international standard “must be disciplined by being based upon State practice and
judicial or arbitral caselaw or other sources of customary or general international law”.*'°
208. The international minimum standard and the treaty standard continue to influence each other,”!”
and, in the view of the Tribunal, these standards are increasingly aligned. This view is reflected in
the jurisprudence constante not only of NAFTA caselaw, as discussed above, but also in the
arbitral caselaw associated with bilateral investment treaties.*'* Some tribunals have gone so far
as to say that the standards are essentially the same.*!? The Tribunal finds that there is no material

difference between the customary international law standard and the FET standard under the

“Investment treaties run between North and South, East and West, and between States in these spheres inter se.
On a remarkably widespread basis, States have repeatedly obliged themselves to accord foreign investment such
treatment. In the Tribunal’s view, such a body of concordant practice will necessarily have influenced the content
of rules governing the treatment of foreign investment in current international law. It would be surprising if this
practice and the vast number of provisions it reflects were to be interpreted as meaning no more than the Neer
Tribunal (in a very different context) meant in 1927.”

present BIT. Certainly, the FET standard of the BIT is not lower than the international minimum
standard. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to determine for the purposes of the present case
whether the FET standard reflects an autonomous standard above the customary international law

standard.

2. Whether Ecuador violated Claimant’s legitimate expectations
A. Claimant’s Position

209. Claimant argues that the FET standard prohibits the host State from “alter[ing] the conditions an

+9 320

investor relied upon in making its investment”, which would violate the investor’s legitimate

and reasonable expectations.*”! Claimant notes that tribunals have held that the FET standard

safeguards investors’ legitimate expectations.”

210. Claimant contends that its expectations arose from “specific assurances and representations”, i.e.,
the contractual commitments in the Participation Contract.” In any event, it submits that an

investor’s legitimate expectations can arise from assurances of an “informal, indirect, or more

general nature when an investor relies on such assurances”.*”*

Partial Final Award

Page 67 of 173

Claimant avers that Ecuador violated Murphy’s legitimate expectations by dismantling specific
commitments to: “(i) uphold the terms of the Participation Contract; (ii) maintain an amicable,
cooperative business relationship; (iii) stimulate foreign investment through an open legal and
regulatory framework; and, (iv) promote future investment”.*** Those commitments also included

a guarantee of Claimant’s share in oil production as well as rights of ownership, of free disposal,

and to receive the full value of its share of participation.”

Claimant notes that the Participation Contract, the Hydrocarbons Law, and the BIT, as well as
Ecuador’s legislative and regulatory framework, memorialized those guarantees and

expectations.”’ Claimant submits that it relied on such specific commitments when it agreed that

the Block 16 Service Contract be converted to the Participation Contract.**

Claimant submits that because of Law 42 and its related decrees:

[Respondent] (i) failed to maintain the value of Murphy’s participation, first
decreasing the so-called ‘extraordinary income’ by 50% and then by 99% in the
express terms of Law 42 and its regulatory decrees; (ii) unilaterally modified the
Participation Contract, which expressly prohibits modification unless all parties
agree; (iii) incorrectly applied Ecuadorian law in issuing its Joint Resolution,
thereby failing to void Law 42; (iv) destabilized the legal framework within which
Murphy expected to operate; (v) effectively punished Murphy for a rise in oil
prices when Murphy expected its participation share to remain disconnected from
the price of oil; (vi) repeatedly threatened Murphy with coactiva and caducidad
in addition to continued requests for payment; (vii) attempted to force Murphy to
renegotiate its Participation Contract terms; (viii) generally created a hostile
investment environment, where there once was a cooperative and productive one;
all to the extent that it forced Murphy to sell its share of Block 16 to Repsol and
cease operating in Ecuador. *°

 
   

Claimant argues further that Law 42 and its implementing decrees:

effectively breached and rendered ineffective (i) Murphy’s right to legal stability
and not to have the Participation Contract modified without its consent; (ii) the
inviolability of Murphy’s share of participation in crude production including the

rights of ownership, free disposal, and entitlement to receive the full value of its

share of participation; (iii) Murphy’s right to economic stability, especially the

right to fiscal stability; and [(iv)] Murphy’s right to be exempt from royalties.*”
215. Claimant contends that clauses 15.2 and 22.1 of the Participation Contract guaranteed legal
stability through the application of Ecuadorian laws in force at the time the contract was signed,
subject only to limited exceptions enumerated in clause 8.6.*"! It notes that the Hydrocarbons Law,

which Law 42 amended, was not among the exceptions listed in clause 8.6.**”

216. Claimant submits that clause 11.11 of the Participation Contract guaranteed economic stability.
Pursuant to this provision, Respondent agreed to apply a correction factor if it enacted any tax
measure that altered the tax burden of the parties to the Participation Contract as well as the
contract’s economic equation. That correction factor would adjust the parties’ share of production

to absorb the negative effects of the tax change.

217. Claimant contends that Respondent should have applied the correction factor in the Participation
Contract, which it did not.*™ It explains that “if [Law 42 is] a tax under international law [as
Respondent submits], you have to treat it as a tax under domestic law.”*** Respondent's failure to

apply the correction factor allegedly constitutes a distinct breach of the FET standard.**°

218. Claimant clarifies that it did not request the application of clauses 8.6 and 11.11 of the Participation
Contract because it relied on Respondent’s statement that Law 42 was not a tax.” Claimant
explains, however, that it considers the creation of new taxes as a “modification of the tax regime”
that would trigger the economic stability provision of the Participation Contract.** It notes that

the Participation Contract exhaustively lists all the taxes applicable to Claimant’s investment, thus

exempting Claimant from any taxes that Ecuador might enact during the life of the Participation

Contract.*”

219.

ay

Claimant highlights the importance of the guarantees of legal and economic stability. It explains
that its right freely to dispose of its share of the oil produced would be rendered meaningless “if
Ecuador did not provide protection against changes in the applicable legislation or the economic
equation of the [Participation] Contract”.*"°
220. Claimant alleges that the Participation Contract provided that Murphy Ecuador’s “absolute rights
to participation in oil” were “independent of the price of oil”. It highlights that the parties to the
Participation Contract agreed to exclude the price of oil from the participation formula*”
Claimant submits that Respondent, an experienced actor in the oil industry, played a significant
role in defining that formula, which “allowed [Claimant] to benefit from the full upside of its risky
investment”.** Claimant contends that had the parties to the Participation Contract intended the
price of oil to limit participation in oil production, they would have included a clause in the

contract to that effect.

221.

From this, Claimant states that the parties to the Participation Contract knew that the Consortium
would bear the risk of low oil prices going forward, given the relatively low prices of oil in 2006,

but also that “the Consortium would benefit from rising oil prices”.*“

222. Claimant clarifies that it is not asserting entitlement to “windfall profits” but is instead requesting
that Respondent fulfill its commitments under the Ecuadorian legal framework, the Participation

Contract, and the BIT.*“’ Claimant contends that it need not show that Ecuador’s commitments

gave Claimant a right to “windfall profits” but only that they gave rise to legitimate expectations

that Claimant relied on and that Ecuador contravened through Law 42."

Claimant states that, even without Law 42, it would not have made any “windfall profits.” It
explains that its investment in Ecuador was “an unprofitable venture”; indeed, even if the Tribunal
awarded the damages claimed, Claimant states that its rate of return for its investment in Ecuador

would still fall below the cost of capital for the project.*°

Claimant avers that the confiscation through Law 42 of all but 1% of the “windfall profits” belies

Respondent’s claim that Law 42 was enacted “simply” to prevent “windfall profits”.*!

Claimant rejects Respondent’s argument that Claimant was only entitled to its share in the oil
production and not to the revenues from the sale of that share.**? Claimant submits that “oil
companies are in the business of making money,” not “getting [oil] off the ground and stor[ing]

it”>* It reiterates that the Participation Contract protected the full value of its share of oil.***

B. Respondent’s Position

While acknowledging that the determination of whether the international minimum standard has
been violated may involve the investor’s legitimate expectations,’ Respondent argues that
obligations arising from “legitimate expectations” are not part of customary international law and

do not create stand-alone obligations for the host State.>*°

an investor’s expectations are irrelevant to the FET standard because Article II(3)(a) requires that

358,

FET be accorded to the investment, not the investor.”’” Respondent states that the parties to the

BIT intended to limit the FET standard to the international minimum standard, which excludes

obligations from investors’ expectations.*”

228. Respondent argues that even if the FET standard includes obligations arising from legitimate
expectations, those expectations must be based on “actual, authorized, and specific representations

or assurances” from the host State, which Ecuador allegedly did not provide to Claimant That

requires establishing a causal link between the investment and the specific promise by the State.**!

Respondent adds that the investor must then demonstrate that the State actually breached that

specific promise.*

229. Respondent reiterates that “this is a dispute about windfall profits’*° It submits that the
Participation Contract did not provide Claimant with a contractual expectation of “windfall
profits” because Murphy Ecuador was not guaranteed “the value of [its] participation” >“

230. Respondent argues that the Participation Contract only guaranteed Murphy Ecuador’s right to its
share in oil production and not a revenue stream from any ensuing sale of oil.*° The Participation
Contract likewise recognised the continuing application of Ecuador’s fiscal powers to any income

from the sale of Murphy Ecuador’s share of oil.*°°

231.

Respondent further asserts that it did not restrict Murphy Ecuador’s rights to sell or transfer its oil,

rights which remained unaffected by Law 42.” Indeed, Respondent alleges that the Consortium

always fully exercised its rights to ownership over and free disposal of its production share

232. Respondent submits that Claimant’s argument that Ecuador did not comply with its contractual
obligations conflates the FET clause with the BIT’s umbrella clause.*” It argues that accepting
this argument “would put all agreements between an investor and a host State under the protection
of the FET standard [which] would become for certain types of claims a mere clone of the umbrella
clause”.°””

233. Respondent rejects Claimant’s contention that clause 22.1 of the Participation Contract is a legal

stabilisation clause. It asserts that: (1) clause 22.1 is a typical choice of law clause whereby the

contracting parties subject themselves “to a given system of law, not to a specific set of legal rules
taken as frozen at a particular moment in time”; (2) Claimant's interpretation renders “key” clauses
in the Participation Contract contradictory or meaningless; and (3) clause 22.1 could not act as a

legal stabilisation clause as a matter of Ecuadorian law.*”!

234. Respondent explains that Ecuador and the Consortium agreed on a long-term oil price assumption
of USD15.26/bbl based on the economic situation when the Participation Contract was being
negotiated.*” Thus, the “historic” high prices of oil in the mid-2000s purportedly went beyond
what the oil companies had contemplated and undermined a key assumption of the Participation

1373

Contract Respondent characterizes the increase in oil prices as “unforeseen, unprecedented,

unexpected, [and] unforeseeable”.>™4

235. Respondent clarifies that, had the parties to the Participation Contract expected the increase in oil
prices, they would have incorporated this expectation into the Participation Contract.*”> Barring
that, Respondent allegedly would not have converted the Block 16 Service Contract to the

Participation Contract.>”°

236. Respondent notes further that Claimant’s internal model used an average high price assumption
of $15.55/bbl.*”” Respondent therefore submits that “Claimant could not have reasonably expected

its price upside to exceed the ‘high’ price scenario described in its economic model”.*”*

237. Respondent alleges that “the Parties’ price expectations, which is what they projected oil prices

were going to go through the life of the [Participation] Contract, was a fundamental basis for the

share participation formula that was eventually agreed”.*” This is the case, Respondent notes,

even if oil price was not a component of the production share allocation formula.**°

238. Respondent submits that an investor’s “expectations must be ‘reasonable’ in order to be protected
under the FET standard”.**! It argues that “Claimant could have expected that in the event of an
extraordinary increase in the price of oil, the Republic might enact new legal rules having an effect

similar to that of Law 42”**?

239. Respondent contends that “[a]s a seasoned player in the petroleum sector, Claimant knew that if
oil prices increased in a dramatic fashion, the Republic could be expected to act to protect the
public interest and to seek to avoid a scenario whereby a windfall inures to the sole benefit of
petroleum operators”.**?

240. Respondent asserts that it is “expected industry practice” for States to use tax changes and related
measures, such as windfall profit taxes, to obtain an equitable benefit from changed economic
circumstances.*™ It notes that more than two dozen sovereign States enacted measures “to preserve
the value of their petroleum resources for their citizens” in light of the historic increase in oil prices

in the mid-2000s.**

241.

Respondent further avers that the Participation Contract was subject to the Ecuadorian legal
framework under which a party has the right, under the principle of “teoria de la imprevision" or
“clause rebus sic stantibus” to renegotiate a contract if the circumstances forming the basis of the
agreement have changed.**° This principle would purportedly apply to “an unprecedented and

extraordinary increase of international oil prices”.**’ As the principle was applicable in Ecuador

even before the execution of the Participation Contract, Respondent asserts that Claimant could
not have been unaware that a good faith application of the principle required the renegotiation of
the Participation Contract."

Respondent also contends that the Ecuadorian Constitution as well as norms regulating public
administration imposed obligations on the State to request a renegotiation in cases which call for
a more equitable sharing of the “windfall profits”.

Respondent submits that Claimant should have expected that Law 42 would be enforced. It asserts
that the coactiva and caducidad procedures were reasonable exercises of Ecuador’s regulatory

powers, and did not frustrate Claimant’s legitimate expectations.*””

Respondent further notes that: (1) civil law countries use coactiva and caducidad to collect unpaid
taxes or levies; (2) the Consortium agreed, under the Participation Contract, to pay taxes or
contributions and to comply with all applicable laws; and (3) the Consortium made Law 42

payments for two years and then unilaterally ceased those payments.**!

In addition, Respondent submits that: (1) coactiva and caducidad were conducted in full

’s in Ecuador before the coactiva

 

compliance with the law; (2) Claimant agreed to divest its activi
process was initiated, and in any event, the coactiva process was suspended before any collections
were made; and (3) coactiva applied to Repsol YPF as operator and not Murphy Ecuador.*””
Respondent also clarifies that the Consortium was not notified or threatened with caducidad and

that the process was never initiated. °°

Respondent rejects the assertion that the BIT “memorialized” Ecuador’s “guarantees” as the BIT

came into force after the Participation Contract was signed.?”*

C. Analysis of the Tribunal

Introduction

 

247. A host State’s treaty obligation to accord FET to an investment or investor requires the host State

to protect an investor’s legitimate expectations. This has been confirmed by numerous tribunals.*°*

 

248. An investor’s legitimate expectations are based upon an objective understanding of the legal
framework within which the investor has made its investment. The legal framework on which the
investor is entitled to rely consists of the host State’s international law obligations, its domestic
legislation and regulations, as well as the contractual arrangements concluded between the investor
and the State.*°° Specific representations or undertakings made by the State to an investor also
play an important role in creating legitimate expectations on the part of the investor but they are
not necessary for legitimate expectations to exist.*”’ An investor may hold legitimate expectations
based on an objective assessment of the legal framework absent specific representations or

promises made by the State to the investor.

249. An investor’s legitimate expectations are grounded in the legal framework as it existed at the time

that the investment was made.*** Accordingly, the Tribunal must make an objective assessment of

Murphy’s legitimate expectations at the time that it made its investment in Ecuador, taking into

consideration all of the relevant circumstances.*”

Murphy made its original investment in Ecuador in 1987 when it acquired a 20% interest in the
Block 16 Service Contract through two of its subsidiaries—Murphy Ecuador and Canam—who
each held a 10% working interest.” Murphy maintained a 20% interest in the Consortium from

July 1987 through March 2009 when it sold Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF.

Notwithstanding that Claimant’s original investment was made in 1987, the legal framework in
Ecuador as it applied to foreign investors generally, and the contractual arrangements that applied
to Claimant’s investment specifically, changed significantly in the mid-1990s. When Claimant
entered into the Participation Contract in January 1997, the nature of its investment changed in a
fundamental way; it gained the right to a share in oil production. Under the new contract, it bore
exploration, development and production costs, and thus, inherently, the risk of low oil prices. It
also stood to gain from an increase in oil prices through sales of its share in production. Given the
significantly different legal framework that existed at the time of Claimant’s original investment
in the Block 16 Service Contract and its subsequent investment in the Participation Contract, the
Tribunal finds that it is relevant to assess Claimant’s legitimate expectations as of 1997. Indeed,

this is how the Parties have pleaded the case.

 

The International and Domestic Legal ‘kL inning Claimant’s L

Expectations

In view of the poor results Ecuador had experienced under the services contracts concluded in the
mid-1980s, it sought to amend its legal regime so as to allow participation contracts under which
investors and the State would share participation in oil production. This required an amendment

to Ecuador’s Hydrocarbons Law.

When introducing the bill to amend the Hydrocarbons Law, the Ecuadorian President Duran
Ballén issued the following statement to the President of the National Congress:
[T]he limited financial resources that the country has [...] do not justify

PETROECUADOR’s assumption of all the risk involved in exploration activities;
such risk must be shared with international petroleum companies.

Led

The Services Contract has become an extremely complex contract in terms of
management and control, due to the relationship of dependency created among
the various State agencies. Moreover, the provision for mandatory reimbursement
of the contractor’s investments, costs and expenses has significantly reduced the
participation of the State in the economic benefits of oil exploration and
production in medium and small fields.

 

Finally, the Service Contract does not permit the contracting company to have a
production flow of its own. This characteristic goes against the interest and raison
d’étre of international oil companies, for the majority of whom the availability of
production is an essential aspect of marketing in international markets.

The new proposed contract—the participation contract—will allow Ecuador to
position itself at an internationally competitive level for attracting venture capital,
because the contractor company, through the bidding process, shall set the

i iti for the ion for its i The State, in any

case and whichever the production level, shall have priority to receive a share of
the production of the area under the contract.*”!

254. On 29 November 1993, the amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law (Law No. 44) was implemented

through Decree 1417.4

The Decree introduced the production sharing contract-type to Ecuador’s
oil industry with the aim of obtaining “greater technical and economic efficiency, for the benefit
of the Government's interest.” It contained a number of provisions designed to attract foreign
investment, including (1) confirmation that contractors would be entitled to participation in oil
production, calculated using formula established in the contracts; (2) an exemption from royalties;
and (3) an economic stability clause ensuring that the participation in production would be
readjusted to maintain the economics of the contract if the applicable tax regime was modified.“
Decree No. 1416, issued on 21 January 1994, provided the contractual bases upon which
production sharing would be regulated.” It also confirmed that under the participation contract
scheme, contractors were delegated the right to explore and exploit hydrocarbons and to incur on
their “own account and risk all investments and costs and expenses required for exploration,

development and production.“

In December 1993, the Law on the Modernization of the State was passed.‘ It sought to

modernise the public sector, encourage privatisation, and enhance public-private partnerships. The

State undertook to delegate the exploration and exploitation of non-renewable natural resources

owned by it to public-private partnerships or private entities, subject to the State’s guarantee that
such resources would be explored and exploited “for the benefit of the nation.”“””

As part of the overhaul and modernisation of its hydrocarbons industry, Ecuador entered into 27

bilateral investment treaties, 19 of which were concluded in the 1990s.°* The US-Ecuador BIT

was signed on 27 August 1993.”

It was within the context of this positive legal reform that the Consortium and Petroecuador
entered into negotiations in mid-1996, with a view to transforming the Block 16 Service Contract
into a participation contract. It is uncontested that both parties were represented during
negotiations by highly-qualified executives and that the negotiations themselves were lengthy and
detailed.*"° Both parties believed that they would benefit from the conversion to a participation
contract. Petroecuador, having reimbursed costs but having received little in the way of revenue
for the preceding decade, considered that it would be better off shifting the responsibility of costs
to the contractor, even if that meant relinquishing a share in production. The Consortium believed
that it would benefit from a direct participation in oil production because that would enable it to

1

profit from the upside of increased oil prices."!' According to Mr. DePauw (who worked for

Murphy from 1982 to 2007, in management positions), that was one of the main reasons Murphy

decided to stay in Ecuador:

One of the main reasons that Murphy decided to remain in Ecuador and convert
to the production-sharing format was that we had envisaged that oil prices would
in fact increase. We saw this as one of the main upsides to balance out the added
risks that the Participation Contract entailed.4"?

On 27 December 1996, the Consortium and Petroecuador entered into the Participation
Contract.*"? It is at this point in time that Murphy’s legitimate expectations are grounded; namely,
at a time when Ecuador was striving to retain and attract foreign investment. Through its legal
reforms, it held itself out as being able to provide a modern, stable, and predictable legal and

business framework that would operate for the mutual benefit of foreign investors and Ecuador.

Significant positive legal reforms continued after Claimant agreed to the Participation Contract.
In December 1997, Ecuador passed the Investment Promotion and Guarantee Law in which it
made many important undertakings.*"* For example, Ecuador offered several guarantees, such as
legal stability and government support to develop economically viable projects.*'* It also declared
the hydrocarbons sector a national priority.‘'° It awarded investors rights of ownership without
limitation, except for those under laws in force.*'’ Ecuador undertook to ensure that its agencies
and other public sector entities would respect constitutional guarantees.*'* It also undertook to
comply with its investment treaty obligations, and confirmed its consent to international arbitration

in accordance with the investment treaties that it had signed."

In addition, in August 1998, Ecuador amended its Constitution. It further committed to provide a
stable and reliable legal and institutional framework to promote the development of all economic
activities.””° It also authorised Ecuador to include stabilisation clauses in contracts so that such

contracts would not be affected by any future changes in the laws.””!

Cc Ar Underpinning Claimant’s Legitimate E:

The Tribunal turns next to an examination of the contractual arrangements agreed by the Parties
under the Participation Contract. The Tribunal confines its examination to those terms that it

considers pertinent to its analysis of Claimant’s legitimate expectations.

One fundamental point of difference between the Parties is whether, as argued by Respondent, the
price of oil was a variable to be included in the calculation formula of clause 8.1 of the
Participation Contract (which would generate a certain guaranteed rate of return), or whether, as

argued by Claimant, Claimant’s participation share was to be based on production volume alone.

Clause 8.1 sets out the formula by which Claimant’s share of production was to be calculated.
There is no mention of a price factor in clause 8.1 of the Participation Contract. Nor is there a
reference to a rate of return. It appears from the text of clause 8.1 that the Contractor’s participation

was linked to volume of production:

8.1. Calculation of Contractor’s Production Sharing: Contractor’s
Production Sharing shall be calculated according to the following formula:

PC=*%io9
Where:
PC = Contractor’s Production Sharing.
Q = Fiscalized Production.
x = Average factor, as a percentage rounded up to the third decimal

point, corresponding to Contractor’s Production Sharing. This is calculated in
accordance with the following formula:

EXIgl x2 4+383
x la

Where:

q = Average daily Fiscalized Production for the corresponding
Fiscal Year

ql = Portion of q lower than L1

qo = Portion of q between L1 and L2

gg oo= Portion of q greater than L2

Parameters L1, L2, X1, X2, and X3 are the following:

L1 = 20,000 Barrels per day
L2 = 40,000 Barrels per day

X1 = 84.74%
X2 = 77.00%
X3 = 60.00%

Page 82 of 173

The State’s Production Sharing cannot be less than 12.5% if the Fiscalized
Production (q) does not reach 20,000 Barrels per day. Production sharing shall
increase to a minimum of 14% if the daily production is between 20,000 and
40,000 Barrels, and shall not be less than 18.5% if production exceeds 40,000
Barrels per day.

In consequence, Contractor’s Production Sharing may in no case exceed the
limits of 87.5%, 86%, and 81.5%, respectively.

In order to determine The State’s Production Sharing and Contractor’s
Production Sharing, “Q” shall be estimated in advance by the Parties every
quarter. In order to determine the definitive State’s Production Sharing and
Contractor’s Production Sharing, the actual values corresponding to the
Fiscalized Production and API degrees for the relevant Fiscal Year shall be used.
The X factor shall be estimated during the first ten (10) days of the
corresponding Quarter on the basis of the daily Fiscalized Production and its
quality during the immediately preceding Quarter. Upon commencing
Fiscalized Production, and while it is not possible to estimate and apply the X
factor according to the above procedure, Contractor’s Production Sharing shall
be assumed to be equal to X2. In order to calculate the definitive X factor,
Fiscalized Production and quality shall be used according to their actual values
for the relevant year or fraction thereof and shall be settled during the first
Quarter of the Fiscal Year next following.

Respondent argues that the Report of the Renegotiating Committee, annexed to the Participation
Contract at Annex V,*” contains the mathematical equation upon which the parties negotiated the
basis for calculating the Contractor’s production share. Respondent points out that the crude oil
price of USD 15.26 per barrel is listed as a basic parameter that was “negotiated” by

Petroecuador’s commission and the Consortium."

Annex V is a copy of the Report of the Renegotiation Commission. It constitutes the results of an
internal negotiation team’s detailed analysis pertaining to the conversion of the Block 16 Service
Contract to the Participation Contract.‘*4 Specifically, the authors adopted economic parameters
with which to analyse the projected benefits of such a conversion.’** One parameter that they had
to estimate was the price of oil over the lifetime of the contract. They assumed a price of USD
15.26 per barrel, and, using that as one of several basic parameters, concluded that the conversion
from the Service Contract to a participation contract would be in the State’s economic interests.*”°

Indeed, the purpose of the analysis was to satisfy the State that the terms negotiated with the

Consortium were in the State’s interest.’”” Given this background, it cannot be said that Annex V
reflected an “agreement” between the parties to the Participation Contract that a reference price
variable of USD 15.26 per barrel was to be included in the calculation formula of clause 8.1. While
the Renegotiating Committee Report refers to those parameters as “negotiated”, on the evidence
before it, the Tribunal does not accept that Claimant agreed to the parameters adopted by
Petroecuador’s team.“* Rather, clause 8.1 reflects the factors agreed by the parties for the

calculation of the Contractor’s participation in production.

The Tribunal is not persuaded otherwise by Respondent’s reference to clause 3.3.9 of the
Participation Contract which reads: “This instrument, including its supporting documents and
exhibits, which shall as a whole be called ‘Production Sharing Contract for Exploration and
Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block No. 16.”°° While the Tribunal accepts that
this clause incorporated all supporting documents and exhibits into the Participation Contract, it
does not mean that the contents of each document reflected an agreement of the parties,

particularly when some of the documents, on their face, were prepared by one side only.

The Tribunal also notes that, in contrast to the present case, Petroecuador did negotiate
mechanisms to address price variations in other contracts.’ For example, in July 1995, Ecuador
concluded a participation contract over the Tarapoa Area. That contract was premised on the same
participation formula as that in clause 8.1 of the Participation Contract, except that at the end of

clause 8.1, the Tarapoa contract said:

If the price of crude oil in the Block exceeds USD 17 per barrel, the surplus of the
benefit brought about by the price increase in real terms [...] will be distributed
between the Parties in equal shares.**!
The parties to the Tarapoa Contract expressly factored in the price of oil. Had the parties to the
Participation Contract truly agreed on such a significant term, that term would have been reflected
clearly in the contractual documents as it was in the Tarapoa Contract. Given that the negotiation
teams for both sides were sophisticated and experienced actors in the oil industry, the Tribunal

does not accept that the reference to USD 15.26 as a “basic parameter” in Annex V indicates that

the parties had agreed that the price of oil would be a factor for the calculation of the Contractor’s

production share.

The Tribunal further notes that the Burlington and Occidental II tribunals reached the same
conclusion with respect to the formula for the calculation of the contractor’s production share
(which is the same formula as in this case) and the reference to a price of oil in an annex V to the

underlying contracts (where those annexes also comprised reports of the renegotiating committee):

Annex V was not intended to set out the terms of the prospective [Participation
Contract], but merely to establish whether it would be in Ecuador’s interest to
enter into a [Participation Contract] in lieu of a service contract from an economic
standpoint.”

It is clear to the Tribunal that, in the Participation Contract, the Claimants
knowingly accepted the risk of losses on its investment in case of a low price
scenario and the Respondent knowingly forewent the opportunity to increase its
participation in case of a high price scenario. This was the bargain which was
struck by the parties and which was reflected in the Participation Contract.
Under clause 10 of the Participation Contract, Claimant had the right to “freely dispose of the
Crude Oil that corresponds to it,” subject to domestic supply needs.*™4 Clause 10.2 guaranteed
Claimant the right to market its production share on the domestic or international markets, and

Article 10.3 of the Contract guaranteed Claimant the full value of its share of production.*

In addition, clause 15.2 of the Participation Contract provided that it would be possible to modify
the contracts upon the prior agreement of the parties. The contracts could not be modified

unilaterally.

272. As stated by the tribunal in Perenco:

In cases where a contract exists between the investor and the host State, the terms
of the contract and the State’s legislation in relation thereto, assume particular
significance in the analysis.

Led
Where a State has duly considered a legislative/regulatory policy, as was the case

in 1994 when Ecuador resolved that it was in the nation’s interest to move from
service to participation contracts, governmental decisions taken thereafter must,

during the lifetime of such contractual arrangements maintain fidelity to that
policy framework. This is not to say that the policy framework is frozen and
cannot be changed because this is not so unless the State has expressly stabilised
its law vis-a-vis its contractual counterparty. But [...] any changes to the policy
framework must still be made mindful of the State’s contractual commitments.

The Participation Contracts were anchored in a legislative framework duly
considered and enacted by the Nation’s Congress. That framework and its
rationale set out certain key features of the new contractual regime which were
then reflected in the contracts subsequently concluded with oil companies.
Consequently, any contractor could reasonably expect that the contracts’ structure
would not be altered by Petroecuador unilaterally or undone by subsequent State
action external to the contract except in accordance with their terms and the
State’s law.

Conclusion on Claimant’s Legitimate Expectations

Considering both the terms of the Participation Contract and the legal framework that was in place
in Ecuador at the time that Claimant signed up to the Participation Contract, the Tribunal finds
that the Consortium members held legitimate expectations that the terms of the Participation
Contract would not change except within the confines of the law and pursuant to a negotiated
mutual agreement between the contractual partners. The State had committed to maintaining a
contractual business relationship with the Consortium according to the terms of the Participation
Contract set within a stable and predictable legal and business framework. What those guarantees
meant in practical terms for the Contractor was that the price of crude oil would not be factored
into the calculation of its participation share in the contract. As such, Claimant would assume the
risk of any decrease in the price of crude oil as well as the benefit of any increase, in exchange for
assuming the risk of its exploration activities.**”” Claimant would then enjoy the principal benefit
obtained by its decision to convert the Block 16 Service Contract into the Participation Contract,

which was entitlement to full ownership of a percentage of its production through participation.***

Claimant has alleged that Respondent’s enactment of Law 42 along with its implementing decrees
breached the Treaty’s FET standard. The Tribunal shall now consider the enactment of Law 42
and Decree No. 1672.

Whether Law 42 at 50% Breached Claimant's Legiti E

Law 42 stipulated that the State would be entitled to receive “participation in the surplus of oil

sale prices”. It clarified that “the surplus of oil sale prices” meant the “extraordinary income”

arising from the price difference between the then-prevailing oil price and the oil price prevailing
at the date the participation contracts were concluded, multiplied by the number of oil barrels. The
minimum percentage of participation of the State in the extraordinary income would be 50%.*”

Decree No. 1672 set the additional participation at the minimum percentage of 50%.

The sharp increase in global oil prices that began several years into the Participation Contract was
not foreseen by the Consortium or Ecuador. It dramatically changed the dynamics of the oil
industry in Ecuador and oil industries around the world. It is well recognised in investment treaty
arbitration that States retain flexibility to respond to changing circumstances unless they have
stabilised their relationship with an investor.““° Ecuador was within its sovereign right to react to
the significant change in oil prices, as many States did.“*' Indeed, it would not have been
reasonable for the contractors to expect that the contractual terms or Ecuadorian law would not
change at all in the face of such exceptional prices rises. This is all the more so given that the
Consortium knew that the “interests of the State” had been a key factor in the overhaul of the
hydrocarbons industry in the 1990s and a key qualifier to certain State guarantees. As expressed

by the Perenco tribunal:

It would be unsurprising to an experienced oil company that given its access to
the State’s exhaustible natural resources, with the substantial increase in world oil
prices, there was a chance that the State would wish to revisit the economic
bargain underlying the contracts.”
In late 2005, Petroecuador invited the Consortium to negotiate the Participation Contract towards
an increase in the State’s share and appointed a renegotiation committee for this purpose.

443

However, the Consortium rejected the invitation.“ According to Respondent, it was in the face

of the unwillingness of investors to renegotiate their contracts that it decided to enact Law 42.

Following the enactment of Law 42 and Decree No. 1672, the Consortium was then entitled to
only 50% of the “extraordinary” revenue generated from sales of its production share. The
Tribunal does not consider that this fundamentally changed the operation of the Participation

Contract for the Consortium. The latter continued to receive a share of production calculated under

the Participation Contract. It was still able to earn more revenue with Law 42 at 50% than it did
before the oil price rise, notwithstanding that it was not receiving the full potential revenue from

those sales. What is important is that the basic structure of the agreement remained in place.

Further, the Tribunal does not consider that the Participation Contract contained a stabilisation
clause such that the Government could make no legislative or regulatory adjustments in what were
exceptional circumstances. Claimant has argued that clause 22.1 of the Participation Contract is a
legal stabilisation clause. The Tribunal does not accept this. Clause 22.1 is entitled “applicable
legislation”. It does not identify itself as a legal stabilisation clause and is more properly
characterised as a choice-of-law clause with a temporal clarification. It does not guarantee that the
legal regime in place at the time of contracting shall not change. Indeed, the Participation Contract
did contain a number of clauses that sought to maintain the status quo of the contract
notwithstanding changes in the law (clauses 8.6 and 11.11). The very fact that those clauses were
included in the Contract meant that the parties contemplated the possibility of legislative changes

that could affect the Participation Contract.

In light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal does not accept that Claimant could have
reasonably expected that there would be no governmental response to the significant rise in oil
prices. The Tribunal does not consider that the enactment of Law 42 and Decree No. 1672 changed
the operation of the Participation Contract in such a fundamental way that Claimant’s legitimate
expectations of not having its contractual agreement disturbed, or unilaterally changed without
agreement, were breached. In sum, the Tribunal does not consider that the enactment of Law 42
at 50% breached Claimant’s legitimate expectations and thus finds that it did not breach the FET

standard of the Treaty.

Whether Law 42 at 99% Breached Claimants Legiti E

The same cannot be said for Law 42 and Decree No. 662 which was issued on 18 October 2007,
approximately 18 months after the enactment of Law 42. Decree No. 662 raised the State’s
participation in the extraordinary income to 99%. Not only did this development fundamentally
change the nature of the Participation Contract, it occurred within the context of an increasingly
hostile and coercive investment environment. The business and legal framework that existed at
the time the investors agreed to the Participation Contract had fundamentally, and prejudicially,

changed.

The enactment of Decree 662 by President Correa marked the beginning of the State’s demands

that the Contractors revert back to the service contract model. In fact, the application of the 99%

283.

“4 Perenco Decision on Juri

participation of the State effectively transformed the Participation Contract into a service contract.
It meant that the Contractor’s costs were covered but their ability to participate in the upside of
high oil prices was severely limited.““ The Contractor’s entitlement to full ownership of a
percentage of its production was effectively eliminated. Law 42 at 99% changed the foundational
premise upon which the Participation Contract had been agreed. This change was made
unilaterally by the State in breach of the Participation Contract and the then existing domestic and
international legal framework. Specficially, Law 42 at 99% breached clause 10.1 of the
Participation Contract pursuant to which Claimant had the right to “freely dispose of the Crude
Oil that corresponds to it,” subject to domestic supply needs“ and clause 10.3 which guaranteed
Claimant the full value of its share of production.’ It also breached clause 15.2 of the
Participation Contract which provided that modifying contracts would be possible to negotiate and
execute “upon the prior agreement of the Parties.” “” Clause 15.2 referred to Law No. 44 which,
in turn, referred to the Ecuadorian Constitution, and confirmed that Contractors were delegated
the right to explore and exploit hydrocarbons and to participate in production on the basis of agreed
contractual terms.“* In addition, according to Ecuador’s Investment Promotion and Guarantee
Law, contractors such as Claimant enjoyed “right[s] of ownership without limitations other than
those provided under current laws”.” Article 21 of the same law ensured that foreign investment
would be carried out “with the freedom and guarantees established in the Constitution of the
Republic and under the legal and regulatory framework of the Country.“ Article 33 recorded

that the government would encourage compliance with international agreeements for the

 

protection of investments.**! The enactment of Law 42 at 99% ran afoul of the above-mentioned
clauses in the Participation Contract and the domestic legal regime, as well as the promise under

Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty to accord Claimant’s investment fair and equitable treatment.

Following the issuance of Decree 662, on 28 December 2007, the Constituent Assembly approved

tax on profit from oil sales that would apply when the oil price exceeded a reference price on
which Ecuador and the contractor agreed. This applied to all participation contracts, new or

modified, entered into from 1 January 2008 onwards.

284. Shortly after the issuance of Decree No. 662 and the enactment of the Ley de Equidad Tributaria,
President Rafael Correa gave a public radio address during which he declared that oil companies

operating in Ecuador had the following three options:

We are renegotiating the oil contracts. Oil companies have three options:

[1] either they comply with the 99-1 Decree, that is, of the extraordinary profits,
extraordinary! [...] Out of the extraordinary gains: 99 percent for the state and 1
percent for the company because the resource is ours. If they disagree, that’s the
first option, perfect.

[2] We can renegotiate the contract into a services contract which always should
have been the preponderant model in the oil industry. Why? Because if the oil is
ours we hire somebody to take our oil out, right? We pay for the job, $10 for each
barrel of oil extracted, but the rest is for us. So, that’s the contract to which we
want to go, which was in force at the beginning of the’90s [...]. What does
“participation contract” mean? They exploit 100 barrels, they take out 100 barrels
of our oil, the private and transnational oil companies, and they give us a little
piece and the rest they take away [...].

And there are people who defend this. How shameful. They want to take us back
into that opprobrious past, when they took away with no shame the resources of
our country. This revolutionary, patriot and citizen government is renegotiating
oil contracts and we want to go to such special service contracts, that’s how they
are called, where we pay $10 per each barrel of oil, whatever they consider
appropriate.. negotiating obviously, but the rest is for us, the owner of the
resource. So that’s the second option.

[3] And the third option: If they are not happy, no problem. We don’t want to rip-
off anybody here. How much have they spent in investments? $200 million? Here,
have your $200 million and have a nice day, and PetroEcuador will exploit that
field. But we will not allow!

My compatriots, for them to keep taking away our oil. [...] We have to put a limit:
45 days, or if not, they have to continue to comply with the 99-1.4%

285. The Consortium made Law 42 payments under protest and entered into negotiations with
Petroecuador concerning its future operations in Ecuador. In April and December 2008, President

Correa acknowledged that one of his tactics to obtain new terms and conditions under oil contracts

with foreign companies included the issuance of Decree 662 as a “tool of pressure” to force them

to negotiate.“ He was later reported as saying:

[T]hey accused us of threatening the rule of law, of committing an exaggeration,
and they were probably right [...]**

286. Under the Participation Contract, the Government had the power to unilaterally terminate the
agreement if the Contractor failed to make payments due or perform its obligations.** Article 74
of the Hydrocarbons Law set out the specific grounds for unilateral termination (caducidad) of the
agreement.**’ The caducidad process would have required an immediate cessation of all operations
being performed by the Consortium under the Participation Contract and the return to the
Government of the areas covered by it, along with all equipment, machinery, and other assets used
for hydrocarbon exploration and production, without reimbursement.*** It would also entail the
automatic loss of all bonds and guarantees that had been issued in accordance with the
Hydrocarbons Law and the Participation Contract.**°

287. On 17 September 2008, the then-Minister of Mines and Petroleum sent to the Executive President
of Petroecuador an official communication requesting the initiation of the caducidad process for
the unilateral termination of the Participation Contract.“ Notwithstanding the Minister’s request,
the process was not initiated by the Executive President of Petroecuador.**! On 29 October 2008,
the new Minister of Mines and Petroleum sent to the Executive President of Petroecuador a second
request “that the early termination process [of the Participation Contract] be initiated

immediately.“

Ecuador stated that this ication “was part of a consistent practice by Respondent to reach
mutually acceptable agreements with all of its participation contractors, including [Murphy
Ecuador] and its consortium partners, for the voluntary termination of their contracts in return for
new service provider contracts and buyouts of their investments.“

On 19 February 2009, Petroecuador initiated a coactiva proceeding against the Consortium.**
Petroecuador’s Chief of Unit of Finance Administration issued a title of credit and a writ of
payment confirming that the Consortium owed Petroecuador USD 444,731,349.00.4°
Petroecuador issued a second writ of payment on 20 February 2009 and a third writ of payment

on 25 February 2009 for the same amount.

Before any overdue Law 42 amounts were collected from the Consortium, Ecuador and Repsol
YPF reached an oral agreement to move forward with the signing of contractual arrangements. As
a result, the coactiva proceedings were suspended.*”

On 12 March 2009, Murphy exited the Consortium by selling its entire interest in Murphy Ecuador
to Repsol YPF.“** On the same day, the Consortium signed a Modification Contract with the State
that governed the transitional period during which the terms of a service contract were negotiated,

and eventually concluded on 23 November 2010.4°

The Tribunal holds that the enactment and enforcement of Law 42 at 99% constituted a violation
of Claimant’s legitimate expectation that the basic terms of the Participation Contract would not
change except within the confines of the law and pursuant to a negotiated, mutual agreement
between contractual partners. Claimant’s legitimate expectation that it would be treated fairly in a
business-like manner as a contractual business partner was also breached by Ecuador’s coercive

conduct in negotiations.

The Tribunal thus finds that Ecuador breached the FET standard at Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty
when it enacted Decree 662 on 18 October 2007 and when it took actions subsequently to enforce

it.

As the Tribunal has found that Ecuador breached Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, it is not necessary
to determine Claimant’s claims that Ecuador breached other provisions of the Treaty such as
Article II(3)(c) (the “umbrella” clause); (2) Article II(3)(a) (full protection and security); (3)
Article II(3)(b) (non-impairment through arbitrary measures); and (4) Article III(1)
(expropriation). The Tribunal is satisfied that the damages alleged by Claimant under the other
heads of claim are the same as those alleged under its claim for breach of the FET standard; thus
finding a breach under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty as opposed to under any other provision
invoked by Claimant has no impact on the calculation of damages. Moreover, since Claimant has
relied on the violation of several of the Treaty’s provisions as alternative grounds for its claim for
compensation, once the Tribunal has found that one of those alternative grounds is well-founded,
deciding on the other grounds is no longer part of the Tribunal’s mission. It would also not be in

keeping with the Tribunal’s duty to conduct these proceedings in as efficient a manner as possible.
CLAIMANT’S RIGHT TO CLAIM COMPENSATION

The Parties dispute whether Murphy claims compensation for losses in its own right or whether
its claims are solely for the losses of Murphy Ecuador, which have been settled. In order to assess
whether Muprhy’s claims are properly made in its own right and extant, it is useful to recall first

the relevant facts before turning to the positions of the Parties.

On 12 March 2009, Murphy sold its interest in Murphy Ecuador pursuant to the SPA concluded

between Canam and Repsol YPF.*”

At that time, Murphy on the one hand and the Consortium,
including Murphy Ecuador, on the other hand had respective ICSID arbitrations pending.*”! Under
clause 12.7 of the SPA, Canam and Repsol YPF assigned to Murphy all rights and privileges of

Murphy Ecuador that were necessary for Murphy to prosecute its treaty claims against Ecuador.*””

On 23 November 2010, the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador—which was then owned by
Repsol YPF and no longer by Murphy—.,, reached a settlement with Ecuador by which it settled

all of its claims.‘ Consequently, the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, withdrew its ICSID

claims, with prejudice, bringing the Repsol ICSID Arbitration to an end.‘

Little under one month
later, on 15 December 2010, a majority of the tribunal in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration held that

I. Summaries of the Parties’ Positions

1. Whether Claimant Claims Losses in its Own Right or Solely for the Losses of Murphy
Ecuador

A. Claimant’s Position

Claimant contends that it is bringing its own claims under the BIT.“ It submits that Murphy
Ecuador was merely a vehicle through which Claimant invested in Ecuador.” Claimant argues
that its investments in Ecuador comprise, inter alia, its “shares of stock” and “other interests in a
company” and “interests in the assets thereof.” Its investment also included an “investment
contract,” rights “conferred by law and contract,” claims “to performance having economic value,
and associated with an investment.”

Claimant contends that its treaty claims differ from Murphy Ecuador’s claims, which are based on
the Participation Contract.“ It alleges that the distinction between contract claims and treaty
claims means that a “subsidiary can never ‘bind’ its shareholder (let alone its former shareholder)
with respect to the shareholder’s pending BIT rights and claims absent the shareholder’s separate

and express agreement.’”*!

B. Respondent’s Position

300. Respondent submits that Claimant’s claims are solely for the losses of Murphy Ecuador.‘ It
argues that, as a result, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this case because Article VI of the

BIT covers “only losses distinctly suffered by Murphy International”.*** Respondent explains:

No basis whatsoever can be identified in the Statement of Claim for distinguishing
between the harm allegedly suffered by Murphy Ecuador (and which formed the
object of claims now withdrawn with prejudice) and that claimed by its indirect
shareholder, Murphy International. Therefore, because the damage caused by
breach of the BIT, and invoked to support calling upon the Tribunal’s jurisdiction,
must be damage suffered by the shareholder itself, jurisdiction over the claims
here is lacking.*“*

301.

Respondent submits that, rather than bringing claims based on the BIT, Claimant is effectively

asserting claims based on the Participation Contract when “Claimant is neither a party to the

Participation Contract nor in a position to assert claims thereunder.”***

302. Respondent argues that, even if Claimant had standing to claim for the losses of its former

subsidiary, Claimant would not be entitled to compensation,"** because:

First, Claimant caused the sale of its subsidiary, Murphy Ecuador, to Repsol,
with all of that subsidiary’s rights intact, including all rights with respect to the
losses alleged here; the rights to any such losses were subsequently settled in full
by their continuing direct owner, again, Murphy Ecuador, in exchange for
substantial compensation by Ecuador. Second, Claimant had already previously
received from Repsol substantial compensation reflecting the full value of
those rights. As a result, because all of Claimant’s claims are ultimately based
upon the rights of Murphy Ecuador (Claimant having chosen not to pursue
the unmerited claim made in its first arbitration for diminished value of its
indirect shareholding), no compensable claims remain and the case must be
dismissed.”

2. Whether the SPA Prevented the Settlement by Repsol YPF, or Murphy Ecuador’s
successor, of Claimant’s Claims

303. On 12 March 2009, Claimant sold its entire interest in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF pursuant
to the SPA.“*

304. The following provisions of the SPA addressed the issue of Claimant’s claims against Ecuador:

12.7 Pending Arbitration Proceedings.

12.7.1 Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Murphy Exploration &
Production Company — International, an Affiliate of Seller (““MEPCI”),
shall retain, and shall prosecute in its sole discretion, all the claims it may
have against Ecuador for violation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty
between Ecuador and the United States, including the claims made in the
current ICSID arbitration that MEPCI has initiated against Ecuador (the
“Arbitration”). The Arbitration involves claims, among others, for the
diminution in value of MEPCI’s investment in Ecuador through the
Company.

12.7.2 Purchaser further acknowledges that the claims that are the subject matter
of the Arbitration are “investor” claims properly vested and owned by
MEPCI and not “Company” claims vested or retained by Company. All
rights, privileges, and future awards arising from the Arbitration are
retained by MEPCI. Purchaser hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right or claim whatsoever to the rights, privileges and future
awards arising from the Arbitration.

12.7.3 To the extent that certain rights or privileges of Company are required to
be held by MEPCI in the process of prosecuting the Arbitration or
collecting any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal, Purchaser and its
Affiliates, predecessors, successors in interest and _ interrelated
companies, employees, officers, directors, agents, attorneys and other
representatives, do hereby assign to MEPCI all rights and privileges of
the Company which are the subject matter of the Arbitration, including
but not limited to (i) claims to money or claims to performance having
economic value and (ii) any rights conferred by Law of contract. For the
avoidance of doubt, the assignment of rights and privileges set forth in
this Clause 12.7.3 shall be limited to safeguarding the due and punctual
prosecution of the Arbitration and the collection of any awards rendered
by the arbitral tribunal in favor of MEPCI and shall not confer any
monetary rights or performance rights which do not form part of the
subject matter of the Arbitration.

 

12.7.4 Purchaser agrees not to act against MEPCT’s interest in connection with
MEPCI’s claims in the Arbitration. For the avoidance of doubt,

Operations Contracts, or a decision by any member of the Repsol YPF

arbitration claim against the GOE, shall not be deemed to be an act against
MEPCTI’s interest for purposes of this Clause 12.7.4.

12.7.5 The Seller agrees to reimburse, indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its
Affiliates harmless from any damage, loss or expense resulting from an
award in the Arbitration.

A. Claimant’s Position

Claimant contends that the SPA prevented either Repsol or Murphy Ecuador’s successor
(Amodaimi Oil) from settling the claims of Claimant.** It states that “the over-arching goal of the

SPA was to allow Murphy International to exit the Consortium [...] and to allow the other

members of the Consortium to remain in operation.”“”°

On the date of conclusion of the SPA, both Claimant and Murphy Ecuador had pending ICSID

491

arbitrations against Respondent.” While Murphy Ecuador had brought contractual claims and

Claimant treaty claims, Claimant states that its losses were equivalent to Murphy Ecuador’s.*””

Claimant knew that once it sold its interest in Murphy Ecuador, it would not benefit from any
subsequent compensation granted to, or settlement arrived at, by Murphy Ecuador. Claimant

states:

Through the SPA, Canam and Repsol agreed that Murphy International alone
would receive any compensation for the losses through Murphy Ecuador that
Murphy International was claiming in its own arbitration. [T]he entirety of the
SPA’s Clause 12 purported to ensure that Murphy International, and not Murphy
Ecuador, would receive any compensation for such losses, because it was Murphy
International, as the investor and real party in interest, that had suffered those
losses—not Repsol, which was acquiring Murphy Ecuador’s interest in the
Participation Contract at a steep discount.”

According to Claimant, the raison d’étre of clause 12 of the SPA was “to ensure that Murphy

International was the only entity able to recover the losses that it had suffered (either directly or

through Murphy Ecuador).”“* The preservation of Murphy International’s treaty claims was “at

7,495

the heart” of clause 12. Claimant interprets each provision of clause 12.7 as follows.

First, clause 12.7.1—which states that Claimant “shall retain, and shall prosecute in its sole
discretion, all the claims it may have against Ecuador for violation of [the BIT] including the
claims made in the current ICSID arbitration that [Claimant] has initiated against Ecuador™°—
“made clear that the sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol did not affect Murphy International’s own
claims and rights under the BIT, further acknowledging that they were independent from Murphy
Ecuador’s contractual claims.”*””

Second, Claimant alleges that clause 12.7.2, wherein Repsol waived “any right or claim
whatsoever to the rights, privileges and future awards arising from the Arbitration”, confirms that
“Repsol, in its capacity as Murphy Ecuador’s new 100% shareholder, relinquished any possibility

to eventually receive any compensation for such losses” in favour of Claimant.**

Third, Claimant contends that “clause 12.7.3 of the SPA assigned to Murphy International all of
Murphy Ecuador’s rights and claims for losses that Murphy International was pursuing in its own
ICSID Arbitration.” As a result of this assignment, Claimant posits that “Murphy Ecuador had
no rights and claims to settle, to the extent that such rights and claims were or are required to be

held by Murphy International to recover on its own BIT claim.”

Claimant disputes Respondent’s argument that the assignment of claims under clause 12.7.3 was

ineffective. As a preliminary matter, it identifies the purpose of this provision as follows:

[O]ne goal of that provision was to avoid any potential risk of double recovery or
double payment for the losses that, although equivalent in monetary terms, both
Murphy International and Murphy Ecuador could claim against Ecuador, albeit
based on different legal grounds. Murphy International was the intended claimant
and beneficiary for all of those claims following the execution of the SPA. Had
Murphy Ecuador continued to exist and attempted to pursue claims against

Ecuador in its own name after the SPA, Ecuador would have been entitled to
object to that pursuit by virtue of Clause 12.7.3.
Claimant also contests the allegation that it is inconsistent for it to argue that the assignment of
Murphy Ecuador’s rights to Claimant via clause 12.7.3 of the SPA was effective on the one hand,

inct, on the other.*°?

  

and that the Treaty claims and Murphy Ecuador’s contractual claims are di:
Claimant contends that “Murphy International was ‘required’ to hold Murphy Ecuador’s rights
and privileges to ensure that only Murphy International was entitled to claim and eventually collect
any compensation for losses to Murphy Ecuador under the to-be-terminated Participation

Contract.”*? Claimant explains further:

[T]he SPA preserved what Claimant always held (its own BIT claims) and, in
addition, granted to Claimant any and all related rights of Murphy Ecuador as
were necessary to ensure that Claimant’s own BIT claims would not be adversely
affected by the sale. Importantly, it is Claimant’s view that the acquisition of those
additional rights and claims was not “required” in order for Claimant to pursue
the instant BIT arbitration, although in the absence of clear case law at the time,
it was included in the SPA out of an abundance of caution in the event the tribunal
ultimately deciding Murphy International’s BIT claims took a contrary view.**

In response to Respondent’s allegation that the assignment was invalid because it was not
authorised by Ecuador, Claimant submits that authorisation was not required. It says that the
Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law required governmental authorisation for the assignment
of rights arising under the Participation Contract but not for the assignment of claims arising out

of violations of the Participation Contract.

But, even if prior authorisation from Ecuador had
been required, Claimant submits that seeking it would have been futile.*°° Furthermore, Claimant
submits that Ecuador acquiesced in the assignment. Ecuador knew of the SPA before it executed
the Repsol Settlement Agreement in November 2010, and if not then, it knew by the time Claimant

filed its first memorial in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration on 30 April 2009 (the SPA was attached

as an exhibit).*” It claims that Ecuador’s passivity regarding the SPA’s assignment provision
508

demonstrates that it had no issue with it-
314. Claimant asserts that the assignment in clause 12.7.3 was unconditional and_ perfected
immediately.*” Clause 12.7.3 used the BIT’s definition of an investment, which supports the
argument that the assignment covered all treaty claims regardless of forum.*"” It states that “[t]he
parties need not have used different or more precise language to perfect the assignment of Murphy
Ecuador’s claims. Indeed, the broadness of the assignment language compels the opposite
conclusion.”*'! Claimant also notes that clause 12.7.1 “ensures that Murphy International retains
the right to prosecute ‘all the claims it may have against Ecuador for violation of the Bilateral
Investment Treaty between Ecuador and the United States including the claims made in the current

a512

ICSID arbitration that [Murphy International] has initiated against Ecuador.

315. Claimant does not agree with Ecuador’s argument that its claim for lost cash flows goes beyond

the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and, therefore, the scope of clause 12.7.3.
First, it submits that its lost cash flows claims “are part of its BIT claims and need not be covered
by clause 12.7.3 in order to be pursued”.*'* But, if not, Claimant points to the broad wording of
clause 12.7.3 as well as the broad definition in clause 12.7.1 of the “subject matter of the

Arbitration”, which shows that the assignment covered these claims:5'5

Murphy International’s claim for diminution in value (in the ICSID arbitration)
and its current claim for lost cash flows (in the UNCITRAL arbitration) are one
and the same: a claim for the losses that Murphy International suffered in relation
to its investment, as Murphy Ecuador’s indirect 100% shareholder, due to the
forced and premature termination of the Participation Contract, which directly

prevented Murphy International from receiving the economic benefits that it
would have otherwise received from March 12, 2009 (the date of the sale), to
January 31, 2012 (the original date of the Participation Contract’s termination).°"°

Claimant clarifies that the DCF approach it used in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and the lost

cash flows approach it uses now are different methodologies to calculate the same losses.*!”

  

Claimant alleges that clause 12.7.4 of the SPA, which prevents Repsol from acting against
Claimant’s interest in connection with its arbitration claims, was simply a means of “further
ensur[ing] that only Murphy International collected any compensation for the losses through
Murphy Ecuador that Murphy International was claiming in its own ICSID arbitration.”*'*
Claimant rejects Ecuador’s contention that clause 12.7.4 “expressly authorized Murphy Ecuador
to ‘settle or dismiss any arbitration claim’ against Ecuador.”*'? It submits that clause 12.7.4
“requires that Repsol ‘not [...] act against [Murphy International’s] interest in connection with
[Murphy International’s] claims in the Arbitration.””*° This means, Claimant argues, that Murphy

Ecuador could not have settled the treaty claims of Claimant.

B. Respondent’s Position

Respondent alleges that, through clause 12.7.4 of the SPA, Claimant authorised the settlement of
Murphy Ecuador’s claims under the Participation Contract and agreed to be bound by any such
settlement.*” Respondent submits that the binding effect of the Repsol Settlement Agreement on
Claimant derives not from the settlement agreement as such, but from the SPA.* According to
Respondent, clause 12.7.4 not only gave Repsol the right to settle Murphy Ecuador’s arbitration
claims, it also expressed that such a settlement would not be deemed contrary to Claimant’s

interest. It explains the relation of clause 12.7.4 and clause 12.7.1:

[W]hile acknowledging Murphy International’s right to retain and pursue
whatever claims Murphy International might have against Ecuador (Clause

12.7.1), Repsol YPF expressly reserved its own right and that of Murphy Ecuador
to settle any arbitration claim against Ecuador (Clause 12.7.4), including the
claims Murphy Ecuador (now part of the Repsol YPF group of companies)
asserted in the Consortium arbitration. In other words, both Murphy Ecuador and
Murphy International retained their own rights, including the right to settle their
claims made against Ecuador.*?°

319. Respondent contends that Murphy Ecuador was sold to Repsol with the entirety of its rights under

the Participation Contract.*”* It alleges that Claimant knew that Repsol had to acquire the entirety

of Murphy Ecuador’s rights because:

[T]he settlement of all outstanding claims of the Consortium Members, including
Murphy Ecuador’s claims for the repayment of the historical Law 42 payments
and the claim for alleged cash flows under the Participation Contract, both
asserted in the Consortium ICSID arbitration, was a conditio sine qua non for the
contract renegotiation and the eventual Settlement.*””
Respondent contests Claimant’s argument that clause 12.7.3 of the SPA transferred the rights of
Murphy Ecuador to Claimant. It does not agree that clause 12.7.3 was intended to prevent double
recovery, in the form of Claimant and Murphy Ecuador recovering for the same losses, by

requiring the former to hold the rights and privileges of the latter.

Respondent points out that
clause 12.7.3 identifies as its purpose the protection of Claimant’s prosecution of its investor

claims, which differs from precluding Murphy Ecuador from prosecuting its contract claims.*”°

Respondent also submits that Claimant’s argument that clause 12.7.3 of the SPA transferred
Murphy Ecuador’s rights to Claimant is contradicted by (a) clause 12.7.4 of the SPA, which allows
Murphy Ecuador to “settle or dismiss any arbitration claim against the [Respondent]”;**° and (b)
clause 12.7.5, which “confirms that after the SPA, Murphy Ecuador continued to be the rightful
holder and beneficiary of its claims under the Participation Contract”.**! Respondent reiterates that
both Repsol and Claimant needed Murphy Ecuador to retain its own claims. This was necessary,

for Repsol, to be able to renegotiate a contract with Respondent, and, for Claimant, to recover its

investment through the SPA.

Respondent clarifies that Claimant cannot invoke rights under the SPA and the SPA cannot be
invoked against Respondent as neither is party to it.**> Respondent contends that clause 12.7.3 did
not effectively transfer to Claimant any of Murphy Ecuador’s rights because the purported
assignment was (a) subject to a condition precedent that never materialized (as to which, see next
paragraph); and (b) not authorised as required by both the Participation Contract and the

Hydrocarbons Law of Ecuador.**

As to the condition precedent, Respondent states that clause 12.7.3 provided for an assignment
only “to the extent that certain rights and privileges of [Murphy Ecuador] are required to be held
by [Murphy International] in the process of prosecuting the [ICSID] Arbitration or collecting any
awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal.**° It explains that the condition precedent to the
assignment was “indeterminate” in its terms, and that it became forever indeterminable when the

Murphy ICSID Arbitration was dismissed.“

According to Respondent, the SPA purposefully employed “vague and conditional language” in
clause 12.7.3 that would not effect “an actual immediate and effective assignment of [Murphy
Ecuador’s] claims”.**’ This is because both parties understood that the point of the sale of Murphy
Ecuador to Repsol was to permit the latter to settle all Law 42 claims in order to move forward

with the new and extended contractual arrangements with Ecuador.**

Second, Respondent argues that “neither Murphy Ecuador nor Repsol sought, let alone received,

39539

ministerial authorization for the purported assignment’ in violation of Article 16 of the

Participation Contract and Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law.™’ Respondent rejects the

argument that governmental approval was not required for the assignment under clause 12.7.3

 

because this provision was capable of assigning contractual rights but not claims; it explains that
clause 12.7.3 covers any rights under the Participation Contract, including those relating to the

arbitration.

Respondent also contends that it would not have authorised the assignment of rights as that would
have gone against the spirit of the negotiations that were already underway for the conclusion of

the new contract with the Consortium members.*”

But, this having been said, Respondent disputes
Claimant’s assertion that seeking Ecuador’s authorisation would have been futile as “logically
dishonest and evidentially unsupported.”*# Ecuador denies that it acquiesced in (or was passive
with regard to) the assignment in clause 12.7.3; it submits that it “raised the implications of SPA.
Clause 12.7.3 immediately in its first written submission in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration after
the conclusion of the SPA, and (b) [...] raised it in this arbitration immediately after Claimant

relied on Clauses 12.7.1 and 12.7.2 of the SPA (but not Clause 12.7.3).”°"*

Even were clause 12.7.3 effective, Respondent notes that the assignment in clause 12.7.3 excludes
Claimant’s claim for cash flows from March 2009 onwards.** It argues that clause 12.7.3 assigns
only those “rights and privileges of [Murphy Ecuador] which are the subject matter of the [ICSID]
Arbitration”.*“° Respondent asserts that Claimant never brought a claim for cash flows under the

Participation Contract in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration:*””

[E]ven if you could deem the right of Murphy Ecuador to settle its claims
somehow affected by the SPA, such a fact would be limited to the loss asserted
by the Claimant in the ICSID arbitration, since that’s a defined term in the
Agreement. Here, of course, Claimant is now claiming all lost cash flows in
contrast to what it asserted in the first case. So even if it had an effect, it would
only be a limited effect.*#*

Respondent disputes Claimant’s defense that Claimant’s current lost cash flows claim is identical

to its ICSID Arbitration claim for diminution in the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador’s shares.

Ecuador alleges that “[t]he incongruity between Claimant’s ICSID and UNCITRAL claims for

lo

 

is not merely the result of ‘using different methods and available data.’ Claimant is claiming
in this proceeding loss that is conceptually and materially different from that it claimed in its
ICSID arbitration.” It states that the “express rejection of the DCF method [in Claimant’s
calculation of damages] proves beyond contention that Claimant is no longer claiming loss

pertaining to a diminution in the FMV of its shares in Murphy Ecuador.”°*”

3. Whether the Repsol Settlement Agreement Binds Claimant

On 23 November 2010, the members of the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, entered into
the Repsol Settlement Agreement with Ecuador pursuant to which they withdrew all of their claims
in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration with prejudice. On the same date, the Consortium and Ecuador
executed the Final Modification Contract which converted the Participation Contract into a

services contract.

A. Claimant’s Position

Claimant's position is that the Repsol Settlement Agreement did not settle its treaty claims: “since
the BIT claims of Murphy International are separate and distinct from the contract claims of

Murphy Ecuador, the Repsol Settlement could not settle Murphy International’s BIT claims.”**!

Claimant submits that it had neither interest in,** nor control over, Murphy Ecuador at the time
of the settlement because it had sold Murphy Ecuador 18 months prior.*** Claimant notes that in
the ICSID Award on Jurisdiction, issued just after the Repsol Settlement Agreement on 15
December 2010, “the ICSID Tribunal [...] ruled that Murphy Ecuador did not have the ability to

negotiate on behalf of and bind Murphy International”.***

332. Claimant submits that as it was not a party to the Repsol Settlement Agreement, it is not bound by

it. Ecuadorian law limits the binding effect of settlement agreements to their direct parties.**

333. Claimant also argues that the settlement covered only the pending claims in the Repsol ICSID
Arbitration, which did not include Claimant’s claims in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. The parties
to the SPA had assigned to Murphy all of Murphy Ecuador’s claims for losses that were being
claimed indirectly by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.** In light of this assignment,
Claimant argues that a settlement affecting its rights would be void under Ecuadorian law, which
prohibits agreements that settle the rights of third parties.**’ It would also have been in violation
of clause 12.7.4 of the SPA, which prohibited Repsol from acting against Claimant's interest in

the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.**

334. Claimant asserts that neither the SPA nor the Repsol Settlement Agreement, or both collectively,
adequately satisfied its claims for losses.**” It argues that the sale price of Murphy Ecuador was
insufficient compensation for Claimant’s losses arising out of Law 42, not least because the SPA.
carved out any possible compensation for Claimant’s BIT claims from the sale transaction.*°

Claimant describes this carve-out as follows:

[W]hile the Consortium members maintained their claims to be reimbursed for
Law 42 payments they made after March 12, 2009—which obviously included
payments made by Murphy Ecuador (Amodaimi Oil by then) after that date—the
Consortium members withdrew from their claim in the Repsol Arbitration all Law
42 payments made by Murphy Ecuador before March 12, 2009.**

335. Claimant explains that such a carve-out was intended to eliminate the overlap that still existed

between the claims brought by Claimant and Murphy Ecuador in their respective ICSID

legal persons composing the Consortium (i.e., Murphy Ecuador) and not on behalf of the owners
of the shares of the companies forming the Consortium (i.e., Canam and Murphy International.)”

arbitrations.*” It alleges that this was consistent with “the fact that Murphy Ecuador, after the
SPA, no longer held any of the rights and privileges to claim for those losses.”*° Claimant also
clarifies that clauses 12.7.2 and 12.7.3 of the SPA effectively waived its claim to the amount that

it had carved out.

336. As for the Repsol Settlement Agreement, Claimant submits that Murphy Ecuador settled only
claims for losses arising after the execution of the SPA on 12 March 2009 and for which Claimant
had never claimed in its ICSID Arbitration. The SPA had carved out the claims for losses occurring

before 12 March 2009 so they could not be settled.***

337. But, more importantly, Claimant submits that “the Settlement brought absolutely no economic
benefits to Murphy International” given its complete lack of interest in Murphy Ecuador at that
time.*° Claimant also suggests that Murphy Ecuador was not compensated for its losses pursuant
to the settlement, as neither the Repsol Settlement Agreement nor the Final Modification Contract
refers to compensation for Murphy Ecuador or Repsol YPF.*”

338. Sixth and last, Claimant contends that the settlement is irrelevant to liability and damages because,
“in the hypothetical but-for world that the Tribunal must use in assessing compensation”, neither
the SPA nor the settlement would have existed but for Respondent’s BIT breaches.** Claimant
clarifies that the SPA mitigated its losses, which is why it has deducted the sale price, plus the

accrued interest, from the damages claimed.*”

B. Respondent’s Position

Respondent alleges that, under international law, a shareholder can be bound by the settlement of
acompany’s claim if its interests are adequately satisfied.*” Respondent contends that “[a]lthough
not a party to the [Repsol] Settlement [Agreement], Claimant is bound by it because it was enabled
by Claimant, through Claimant’s consent to SPA Clause 12.7.4, and because Claimant’s interests
were adequately satisfied though the SPA price.”*”! According to Respondent, because all the
claims of Murphy Ecuador in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration were settled, “there are no remaining
rights or privileges of Murphy Ecuador that could still be held by Claimant.”°”*

Respondent submits that the settlement reached with Ecuador covered all potential claims that
Murphy Ecuador could have asserted based on the Participation Contract.*” It notes that, “the
scope of the settlement agreement entered into between Ecuador and the Consortium extended to
any claims or losses ever asserted in the course of the Repsol Arbitration, regardless of when they
were made and whether their amount may have evolved in the proceedings.”*”*

Respondent contests the argument that Murphy Ecuador settled only claims that arose after the
SPA was executed.*” It points out that the ““sweeping waiver’ [found in Clause 29.1.2 of the Final
Modification Contract] makes no exception for claims arising before the execution of the SPA.”5”°
Respondent also highlights the similarly broad language in clause 29.1.5 of the Final Modification
Contract; it alleges that, through this provision, Murphy Ecuador agreed to the withdrawal, with
prejudice, of claims arising after the execution of the SPA as well as those arising before.*” It
further points out that the argument that the settlement covered only the claims that were then
pending in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration rests on two allegedly mistaken assumptions: that (1) the
assignment under clause 12.7.3 of the SPA was effective; and (2) Murphy Ecuador had

successfully carved out its claims from that arbitration.5”

342. Respondent submits that “the ‘material or legal benefit” Murphy International enjoyed from [the
SPA and the Settlement] did not stem from the Settlement as such, but from the SPA in the form
of the SPA price, which allowed Claimant to recover its investment.”*” It submits that the USD
78.9 million sale price that Repsol YPF paid Claimant adequately satisfied its interest as it
“reflected accurately the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador’s rights and claims under the
Participation Contract as of March 2009.”**° This was supplemented by Repsol YPF’s assumption

of Murphy Ecuador’s liabilities, estimated at USD 86 million.**'

Respondent also notes that, after
the sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF and before the November 2010 Settlement—under
which Ecuador extended the Consortium Members “significant economic benefits”—, Murphy

Ecuador received its share of cash flow from the Block 16 production.**”

343. Respondent rejects the assertion that Murphy Ecuador was never compensated for the losses that

583

it had settled with Ecuador.” Apart from noting that Repsol YPF and Murphy Ecuador must have

waived their ing claims in exch for such p i Pp also points to

clause 29.1.3 of the Modification Contract, which states that Repsol YPF, Murphy Ecuador, and

other members of the Consortium are not owed anything by Respondent and do not possess

outstanding claims relating to the Participation Contract.

344. Respondent rejects the argument that the Repsol ICSID Arbitration claimants had carved out the
damage claim of Murphy Ecuador from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration. It points out that the carve-
out applied only to the historical Law 42 payments and not to the lost cash flows under the

Participation Contract.*** It also stresses that, while Murphy Ecuador may have reduced the

amount claimed, it did not waive either its legal claim or its rights to such payments.**° It explains

that “the withdrawal of a claim, even when it is done with prejudice, does not, unless otherwise
agreed, amount to a waiver of any underlying rights of the party.”°*’

Respondent rejects the argument that the SPA and the Settlement are irrelevant to the assessment

of Claimant’s claims, insofar as they allegedly resulted directly from the wrongful acts of

Ecuador.** It clarifies that, under the theory of causation in international law, “[t]he pertinent

question is not whether the sale would have occurred in the absence of Law 42, but rather whether

the sale was a direct, immediate and unavoidable consequence of Law 42.5 Tt states that, “the

sale to Repsol was one of several options that Claimant freely considered in making its business

decision to exit from Ecuador”.*””

4. Whether this Case Involves a Risk of Double Recovery
A. Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that awarding compensation to Claimant for either category of its claims would
result in both double payment by Ecuador (Ecuador having already compensated Murphy Ecuador
with benefits under the new contract), and double compensation for Claimant (Claimant having

already received the fair market value of these very same rights by Repsol).*?! Ecuador argues:

Murphy Ecuador has always had the corresponding 20 percent interest in the

amount, of course, that it settled as part of its settlement with Ecuador. [...]
Another key part of the equation is that Murphy International was compensated
for the indirect loss that it held—indirect loss that it had a right to claim for before
these claims were settled when it sold Murphy Ecuador to Repsol. [...] So, Repsol
paid for Murphy Ecuador’s claims, the outstanding claims that were existent then
under the ICSID Arbitration. And Murphy got paid--Repsol paid for the future

Contracts and then eventually under the new service agreement.**

Respondent argues that Murphy Ecuador waived definitively all of the claims it held at the time
of the SPA and the Repsol Settlement Agreement in exchange for compensation paid by Ecuador
(in the form of cash flow payments for Block 16 production under the Modification Contract, and
the extension of significant economic benefits under the Final Modification Contract).°° As a
result, Ecuador argues that Murphy Ecuador has been compensated for any rights it had to
historical Law 42 payments and cash flows and no damages under either category remain

compensable to Murphy.***

Respondent also argues that the prohibition against double recovery in international law applies
even when the subsidiary and the shareholder assert different legal bases to claim the same

losses.

B. Claimant’s Position

Claimant asserts:

Murphy is not seeking to be compensated twice for the same damage. Murphy
seeks compensation for breaches of its own rights under the BIT. The November
2010 Agreement did not constitute a “recovery” for Murphy, because none of the
parties to that agreement were able to settle Murphy’s claims and no benefit
obtained by those parties compensated Murphy. Further, to the extent Repsol
purchased any remaining benefit owed to Murphy Ecuador under the Participation
Contract, Murphy deducts the proceeds of that sale from its claim, so there is not
even a theoretical risk of double recovery in any event.*%

Claimant also stresses that its “claim is limited to the term of the Original Participation Contract
ending in January 2012. By contrast, the settlement of Repsol and Murphy Ecuador’s successor’s
claims occurred in the context of agreeing to a new service contract to replace the Participation
Contract for the period after January 2012.”°°’ Murphy Ecuador did not settle and nor was it

compensated for any losses that effectively occurred before 12 March 2009.°°* The members of

the Repsol Consortium agreed to withdraw their claims and waive their rights to compensation,

but did not acknowledge settlement for their losses.”

  

Claimant submits therefore that Ecuador has not paid for Murphy’s losses claimed in this
arbitration even once, let alone twice.’ Rather, Ecuador ended up increasing its total take from
Block 16 as a result of wrongful conduct." In that light, Claimant argues that even if a threat of
double recovery existed, which is denied, it follows from the unlawful conduct of Respondent;

that unlawful conduct cannot excuse Ecuador’s obligation to compensate Claimant.”

II. Analysis of the Tribunal

The question whether Claimant is entitled to compensation for claims for losses in its own right
and if so, whether the claim for loss is extant, involves several interrelated issues: (1) the Tribunal
must examine whether Claimant is entitled under the Treaty to claim for losses to its indirect
investment, Murphy Ecuador; (2) the Tribunal must interpret clause 12.7 of the SPA to ascertain
what rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador, if any, were assigned to Murphy for the latter’s
prosecution of its Treaty claims, and what rights and privileges, if any, Murphy Ecuador retained
following its sale to Repsol YPF; and, finally (3) the Tribunal shall ascertain what claims were
brought in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration and settled, with prejudice, with the conclusion of the
Repsol Settlement Agreement, and what impact that may have on Murphy’s entitlement to claim

for loss.

The Tribunal shall address these issues in the following order: (1) Claimant’s entitlement under
the Treaty to claim for losses to its indirect investment; (2) the effect of clause 12.7 of the SPA;
(3) Murphy Ecuador’s claims in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration; and (4) the Repsol Settlement

Agreement.

1. Claimant’s entitlement under the Treaty to claim for losses to its indirect investment

It is uncontested that at the time of the breach of the Treaty by Ecuador, i.e., 18 October 2007
(being the date Decree No. 662 was issued under Law 42 to increase the State’s additional
participation to 99%), Murphy was the 100% owner of Canam (a holding company), which, in

turn, was the 100% owner of Murphy Ecuador. At that time, Murphy Ecuador’s share in the

Consortium was 20%. Consequently, at the time of Ecuador’s Treaty breach, Murphy held an

indirect 20% interest in the Consortium through its ownership of Murphy Ecuador.

Article 1(1) of the BIT expressly covers indirect investments. It refers to “any kind of investment
in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies
of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes: [...] a
company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof [...].”
Murphy Ecuador was owned and controlled by Murphy over the relevant period. Murphy’s
investment consisted of its 100% indirect shareholding in Murphy Ecuador through Canam and

thus Murphy Ecuador’s rights under the Participation Contract.

Accordingly, as of 18 October 2007, Murphy had standing to claim for losses at international law
caused to its investment in Murphy Ecuador by Ecuador’s violation of the BIT. At the same time,
Murphy Ecuador was entitled to claim for losses under Ecuadorian law for any breach of the

Participation Contract to which it was a party.

The fact that both Murphy and Murphy Ecuador held entitlements against Ecuador under the
Treaty and the Participation Contract, respectively, did not deprive either entity of its entitlement.
They had different legal personalities and their respective rights to claim losses were not mutually
exclusive. Their claims emanated from two different instruments and gave rise to different causes
of action: Murphy, as a U.S. investor enjoyed standing under the Treaty to bring international law
claims against Ecuador, whereas Murphy Ecuador, a party to the Participation Contract, enjoyed
standing to bring contractual claims against Petroecuador. Investment arbitration case law
recognises that shareholder companies and the companies in which they hold shares have different

rights of action against States.°“

As of 18 October 2007, Murphy had standing to claim for losses at international law caused to its

investment in Murphy Ecuador by Ecuador’s violation of the BIT.

03 Response to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 128, 146.

604 A shareholder has “a separate cause of action under the Treaty in connection with the protected investment,
[...] which can be asserted independently from the rights of [the company]”. See CMS Award, para. 68, CLA-
20/RLA-165. The tribunal in Hochtief also recognised two independent causes of action, one under municipal law
and another one under treaty law as between the locally incorporated company and the shareholder, respectively.
That case involved a settlement by the local company with the State. The tribunal held that since there was no
evidence that the claimant’s rights under the BIT were transferred to the local company to take action on its behalf,
the claimant retained its standing to bring claims with respect to the treatment of its shareholding under the BIT.

2. The effect of clause 12.7 of the SPA

On 12 March 2009, Murphy’s first-tier subsidiary, Canam, and Repsol YPF entered into the SPA
by which Murphy sold its entire interest in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF.

According to Claimant, clause 12 of the SPA assigned to Murphy “all of Murphy Ecuador’s rights
and claims for losses that [Murphy] was pursuing in [the Murphy ICSID Arbitration].”°%
According to Respondent, Claimant sold Murphy Ecuador with all of Murphy Ecuador’s rights
intact, and when Murphy Ecuador settled its claims in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration under the

Repsol Settlement Agreement, those claims were extinguished.

Clause 12.7 of the SPA is critical to determining which claims remained with which entity at the
time of the sale and which claims survived the Repsol Settlement Agreement and the termination
of the ICSID arbitrations. As a preliminary point, the Tribunal notes that the law governing the
SPA is that of the State of Texas.’ The Parties’ arguments on the interpretation of the SPA, and
the validity or effectiveness of the assignment clause contained therein, were not based on Texas
law. The only reference made to Texas law was Respondent’s argument that, under Texas law,
there was a “re-conveyance” of rights to Murphy Ecuador once the Murphy ICSID Arbitration
was concluded.®* In the Tribunal’s view, Texas law is not relevant to its analysis because
municipal law in an international law context is treated as a fact.“ The Tribunal approaches its

analysis of whether an assignment took place under the SPA as a factual one.

The Tribunal turns now to an examination of clause 12.7 of the SPA. It shall address each

provision in turn.

Clause 12.7.1 of the SPA
Clause 12.7.1 of the SPA provides:

Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Murphy Exploration & Production
Company — International, an Affiliate of Seller (“MEPCI”), shall retain, and shall
prosecute in its sole discretion, all the claims it may have against Ecuador for
violation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Ecuador and the United
States, including the claims made in the current ICSID arbitration that MEPCI
has initiated against Ecuador (the “Arbitration”). The Arbitration involves claims,
among others, for the diminution in value of MEPCI’s investment in Ecuador
through the Company.
In clause 12.7.1, Repsol acknowledged and agreed that Murphy would retain and prosecute all
Treaty claims, including those claims made in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. This clause
indicates that all possible Treaty claims were retained by Murphy, not just those claims submitted

by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration at that time.
Clause 12.7.2 of the SPA
Clause 12.7.2 provides:

Purchaser further acknowledges that the claims that are the subject matter of the
Arbitration are “investor” claims properly vested and owned by MEPCI and not
“Company” claims vested or retained by Company. All rights, privileges, and
future awards arising from the Arbitration are retained by MEPCI. Purchaser
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right or claim whatsoever to
the rights, privileges and future awards arising from the Arbitration.
Respondent argues that the distinction that is drawn in clause 12.7.2 between “investor” claims
and “Company” claims shows that Murphy Ecuador retained the claims that it had against
Ecuador, as well as the right to settle those claims." Claimant argues that by waiving its right to
any future awards arising from the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, Repsol YPF—in its capacity as
Murphy Ecuador’s new owner—relinquished any possibility of receiving any compensation for
Murphy Ecuador’s losses. As such, Murphy alone had the right to prosecute and eventually collect
any compensation from Ecuador for those losses.°!!
The Tribunal finds that in clause 12.7.2, Repsol acknowledged that the claims that were the subject
matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration were “investor” claims vested and owned by Murphy (not
Murphy Ecuador), and not “Company” claims vested or retained by Murphy Ecuador. Repsol also

acknowledged that any rights, privileges and future awards arising from the Murphy ICSID
Arbitration were retained by Murphy. It irrevocably and unconditionally waived any right or claim
in regard to such rights, privileges and any future awards.°”? By this clause, the Tribunal finds that
Repsol acknowledged that Murphy had standing to bring “investor” claims under the Treaty with

respect to rights held by its investment, Murphy Ecuador, under the Participation Contract.

This reflects also the Tribunal’s conclusion that Murphy was entitled to claim under the Treaty for
Murphy Ecuador’s losses at the time of sale. Murphy Ecuador was Murphy’s protected investment.
Murphy was therefore entitled to bring claims under the Treaty for losses caused by Ecuador’s
Treaty violations to its investment. It was not necessary for Murphy Ecuador’s rights and
privileges to be assigned to Murphy for Murphy to enjoy standing or an entitlement to claim for

Murphy Ecuador’s losses.
Clause 12.7.3 of the SPA

Notwithstanding the acknowledgement of Murphy’s standing contained in clause 12.7.2, the
parties to the SPA included an assignment clause ostensibly to put the matter beyond doubt. Clause

12.7.3 provides as follows:

To the extent that certain rights or privileges of Company are required to be held
by MEPCI in the process of prosecuting the Arbitration or collecting any awards
rendered by the arbitral tribunal, Purchaser and its Affiliates, predecessors,
successors in interest and interrelated companies, employees, officers, directors,
agents, attorneys and other representatives, do hereby assign to MEPCI all rights
and privileges of the Company which are the subject matter of the Arbitration,
including but not limited to (i) claims to money or claims to performance having
economic value and (ii) any rights conferred by Law of contract. For the
avoidance of doubt, the assignment of rights and privileges set forth in this Clause
12.7.3 shall be limited to safeguarding the due and punctual prosecution of the
Arbitration and the collection of any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal in
favor of MEPCI and shall not confer any monetary rights or performance rights
which do not form part of the subject matter of the Arbitration.

Murphy contends that this clause assigned to Murphy all of Murphy Ecuador’s rights to claim for
the losses that Murphy was already claiming in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.“ In other words,

S12 The SPA defines claims as “any claim, demand, cause of action, chose in action, right of recovery or right of
set-off of whatever kind or description against any Person.” It does not define “right” or “privilege”.

clause 12.7.3 ensured that Murphy—not Murphy Ecuador or Repsol YPF—would receive any

compensation for the losses under the Participation Contract.°"

Respondent argues that the purported assignment was not valid or effective because it (a) was the
subject of a condition precedent that never materialised; and (b) was not authorised as required
under the Participation Contract and the Hydrocarbons Law of Ecuador.°'> Even if clause 12.7.3
was a valid and effective assignment, Respondent argues that (c) the assigned rights could not
have included Murphy Ecuador’s right to receive cash flows under the Participation Contract
because no such right was the subject of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration; and (d) the rights were
re-conveyed to Murphy Ecuador when the Murphy ICSID Arbitration concluded.*'® Respondent
considers that Murphy Ecuador was entitled to settle the claims it had asserted in the Repsol ICSID
Arbitration. In light of the Repsol Settlement Agreement, Respondent’s view is that there are no

remaining rights belonging to Murphy Ecuador that Claimant can hold under clause 12.7.3.

The Tribunal finds that clause 12.7.3 contains a valid and effective assignment by Repsol to
Murphy of all rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador which were the subject matter of the
Murphy ICSID Arbitration to the extent that they were required to be held by Murphy in the
process of prosecuting the Murphy ICSID Arbitration or collecting any awards therefrom. The
rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador which were the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID
Arbitration included Murphy Ecuador’s right of ownership over its share of oil production,’ and

the immutability of the Participation Contract except by agreement of the contracting parties.°'*

The Tribunal does not find that clause 12.7.3 was a conditional assignment. The Tribunal accepts
that it was included in the SPA out of an abundance of caution because the case-law on the point—
ie., the extent to which certain rights or privileges of Murphy Ecuador were required to be held
by Murphy for the purposes of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration—was unclear at the time.°!? Clause
12.7.3 confirmed that to the extent that certain rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador were

required to be held by Murphy for the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, they were so assigned. This

language did not create a condition to be fulfilled for the assignment to be effective; rather, this
language provided a pre-emptive clarification and confirmation as to the scope and subject-matter

of the assignment in case of future doubt.

Respondent argues that the assignment was invalid because Ecuador did not authorise it in advance
as required by Article 16.1 of the Participation Contract and Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons
Law.°”° Claimant submits that the assignment did not require Ecuador’s approval; authorisation
was required for contractual rights under the Participation Contract but not for claims arising out
of violations of the Participating Contract.!

The Tribunal notes that Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law requires governmental authorisation
for the “transfer of a contract or the assignment to third parties of rights arising out of a
contract.” Relatedly, Article 7 of Decree No. 1363 requires authorisation for the “transfer or
assignment of rights.”°? Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract requires authorisation for the
“transfer of this Contract or the assignment to third Parties of the rights arising therefrom.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the SPA did not assign to Murphy any contractual rights under the
Participation Contract within the meaning of Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law or Article 7 of
Decree No. 1363. The assignment only related to rights and privileges held by Murphy Ecuador
which formed part of the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration (and only to the extent
they were needed for prosecuting the Murphy ICSID Arbitration). Clause 12.7.3 expressly did not
“confer any monetary rights or performance rights which [did] not form part of the subject matter
of the [Murphy ICSID] Arbitration.” Clause 12.7.3 was strictly limited to safeguarding Murphy’s
prosecution of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.

Claimant argues that even if there was no authorisation, Ecuador acquiesced in the assignment.
Claimant says that Ecuador became aware of the assignment from at least 30 April 2009, the date
on which Claimant submitted a copy of its memorial on the merits in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration

to which the SPA was attached. Claimant argues that Ecuador’s subsequent failure to object

indicates that it acquiesced in the assignment. Respondent submits that it never considered that
any rights or privileges of Murphy Ecuador had been effectively transferred through clause 12.7.3
of the SPA. In support of this point, Respondent relies on footnote 106 of its Memorial on

Objections to Jurisdiction filed in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration on 15 August 2009, which states:

[...] Although clause 12.7.3 of the SPA assigns to Claimant Murphy — “[t]o the
extent that certain rights or privileges of Company [Murphy Ecuador] are
required to be held by [Murphy International] in the process of prosecuting the
Arbitration or collecting any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal” — “all rights
and privileges of the Company [Murphy Ecuador] which are the subject matter”
of the instant arbitration, “including but not limited to (i) claims to money or
claims to performance having economic value and (ii) any rights conferred by
Law or contract,” it also limits said assignment of rights providing: “For the
avoidance of doubt, the assignment of rights and privileges set forth in this Clause
12.7.3 shall be limited to safeguarding the due and punctual prosecution of the
Arbitration and the collection of any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal in
favor of [Murphy International] and shall not confer any monetary rights or
performance rights which do not form part of the subject matter of the
Arbitration.” Id. (emphasis added). In other words, cutting through the circular
and deliberately opaque language of the SPA, the underlying principle of the SPA
deal is arguably that Murphy Ecuador has retained all rights it has to recover from
the Republic of Ecuador for any alleged loss it claims it suffered due to any
alleged payments made by it under Law 42 which are the subject matter of the
Repsol/Murphy Ecuador arbitration which is currently pending.”

 

The Tribunal does not find that this is an objection to the assignment in clause 12.7.3. In fact, in
the footnote, Respondent first confirms the terms of the assignment as stated in clause 12.7.3.
Respondent then submits that the underlying principle of the SPA is “arguably” that Murphy
Ecuador retains all rights for any alleged loss it claims with respect to the Law 42 payments

currently pending in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration.

The Tribunal concludes that Ecuador acquiesced in the assignment of the historical Law 42 claims
by Murphy Ecuador to Murphy. It also finds that Ecuador, having knowledge of the SPA from at
least 30 April 2009, acquiesced in the assignment of all other rights and privileges held by Murphy
Ecuador that were the subject-matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration to the extent they were
required to be held by Murphy for the prosecution of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.

The Tribunal recalls that on 19 December 2009, Ecuador was notified that Murphy Ecuador’s

claims for damages based on historical Law 42 payments were withdrawn from the Repsol ICSID

Arbitration because they were being claimed by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.’
There is no indication before this Tribunal that Ecuador objected to the carve-out of these claims
from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration. The Tribunal finds therefore that, quite apart from the question

of whether footnote 106 should be construed as an objection by Ecuador to the

 

ignment of
Murphy Ecuador’s right to claim for historical Law 42 payments, Ecuador acquiesced to the
withdrawal of those claims from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration for inclusion in Murphy’s ICSID

Arbitration.

Further, and more importantly, the Tribunal finds that, as a result of the withdrawal of Murphy
Ecuador’s claims for historical Law 42 payments from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration, there is no
doubt that they were not settled by the Repsol Settlement Agreement. Those claims remain
unsettled and unsatisfied. Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s argument that there
exists a risk of double-recovery or double jeopardy as regards those claims. Murphy remains
entitled to seek compensation for loss it suffered through its indirect investment in Murphy

Ecuador as a result of those payments.

The Tribunal turns now to two final points raised by Respondend as concerns the assignment of
the right to receive cash flows under the Participation Contract. Respondent argues that the
assigned rights could not have included Murphy Ecuador’s right to receive cash flows under the
Participation Contract because no such right was the subject of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.©*
It also argues that those rights were “re-conveyed” to Murphy Ecuador when the Murphy ICSID

Arbitration concluded.©°

The Tribunal is not convinced by either of Respondent’s arguments. The overall purpose of clause
12.7 was to ensure Murphy’s ability to pursue all Treaty claims—which included but was not
limited to the ICSID claims—without obstruction by the sale of its interest in Murphy Ecuador to
Repsol. The SPA provided that: “[Murphy], shall retain, and shall prosecute in its sole discretion,

all the claims it may have against Ecuador for violation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between

Ecuador and the United States, including the claims made in the current ICSID arbitration that

[Murphy] has initiated against Ecuador”.

At the time that the SPA was concluded, the Murphy ICSID Arbitration was the only pending and
relevant proceeding for Murphy’s claims under the Treaty. The Tribunal determines that to restrict
the assignment in clause 12.7.3 to claims as they were formulated in the then pending ICSID
Arbitration would be to undermine the overall purpose of clause 12.7 of the SPA. Clause 12.7 was
designed to ensure that Murphy owned any rights and privileges that were necessary for it to
pursue all Treaty claims, including through an assignment if necessary (the Tribunal does not think
that an assignment was necessary). Clause 12.7.3 only referred to the Murphy ICSID Arbitration
because that was the arbitration that was pending at the time. The Murphy ICSID Arbitration
concluded on 15 December 2010 (one month after the Repsol Settlement Agreement) with a
majority award declining jurisdiction.“ As a result, the merits of Murphy’s Treaty claims were

never determined in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and thus survived that proceeding.

The Tribunal also rejects Respondent’s claim that the rights were “re-conveyed” to Murphy
Ecuador after the conclusion of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. The SPA does not provide for
Murphy Ecuador’s rights to be “re-conveyed” to Murphy Ecuador. In the absence of such

language, the Tribunal is not convinced that those rights were so “re-conveyed”.
Clause 12.7.4 of the SPA
Clause 12.7.4 of the SPA provides as follows:

Purchaser agrees not to act against MEPCI’s interest in connection with MEPCI’s

claims in the Arbitration. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser’s agreement after

the Closing Date to in any way amend the Operations Contracts, or a decision by

any member of the Repsol YPF S.A. group of companies after the Closing Date

to settle or dismiss any arbitration claim against the GOE, shall not be deemed to

be an act against MEPCI’s interest for purposes of this Clause 12.7.4.
Clause 12.7.4 of the SPA contains an undertaking by Repsol not to act against Murphy’s interests
in connection with Murphy’s claims in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. The clause does not specify
what actions would be considered as “against” Murphy’s interest. It does, however, specify certain
actions that would not be considered as “against” Murphy’s interest in the Murphy ICSID
Arbitration, e.g., the settlement of any arbitration claim against Ecuador by any member of the

Repsol group.

The Tribunal interprets this clause as ensuring Repsol’s freedom to settle any arbitration claim
that it or any member of its group of companies had against Ecuador that did not overlap with any
of Murphy’s Treaty claims. If that were not the case, Murphy Ecuador would have been able to
settle claims for the same losses that Murphy was pursuing in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration,

which would have inherently been “against” Murphy’s interests.
Clause 12.7.5 of the SPA
Clause 12.7.5 provides:

The Seller agrees to reimburse, indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its
Affiliates harmless from any damage, loss or expense resulting from an award in
the Arbitration.

According to Claimant, its indemnity to Repsol in clause 12.7.5 only makes sense under an

arrangement in which Repsol did not acquire Murphy Ecuador intact.°*!

Respondent submits that
clause 12.7.5 confirms that after the sale, Murphy Ecuador continued to hold its Participation
Contract claims: “if [Murphy] prevailed in its ICSID arbitration and if Ecuador relied on this fact
to prevent Murphy Ecuador from pursuing its own claims in the [Repsol ICSID Arbitration], or
from settling those claims in exchange for new contractual rights, [Murphy] would be bound to

‘reimburse, indemnify and hold [it] harmless.”””°?

The Tribunal finds that clause 12.7.5 is not probative of whether Repsol bought Murphy Ecuador
with its Participation Contract claims intact. An indemnity clause from Murphy to Repsol is

feasible in both scenarios.
Conclusions
The Tribunal concludes that:

(i) Following Murphy’s exit from the Consortium through its sale of Murphy Ecuador to
Repsol YPF, Murphy was entitled to bring claims under the Treaty for losses to

Murphy Ecuador caused by Ecuador’s Treaty violations;

(ii) It was not necessary for Murphy Ecuador’s rights and privileges to be assigned to
Murphy for Murphy to bring a claim for losses to Murphy Ecuador caused by

Ecuador’s Treaty violations;

(iii) But, if an assignment had been necessary, clause 12.7.3 of the SPA contained a valid
and effective assignment by Repsol YPF to Murphy of all rights and privileges of
Murphy Ecuador which were the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration to
the extent that they were required to be held by Murphy in the process of prosecuting

the Murphy ICSID Arbitration or collecting any awards therefrom; and,

(iv) As a result of the withdrawal of Murphy Ecuador’s claims for historical Law 42
payments from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration, those claims were never settled by the

Repsol Settlement Agreement.

3. What claims were pursued in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration and what claims were
settled by the Repsol Settlement Agreement?

On 9 June 2008, the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, commenced an ICSID arbitration

against Ecuador, referred to herein as the Repsol ICSID Arbitration.°*? Murphy Ecuador and the

other Block 16 Consortium members sued Ecuador under the Participation Contract and, in the

alternative, Repsol sued Ecuador under the Spain-Ecuador BIT.

The Tribunal has examined the claimants’ request for arbitration and main memorial filed in the

Repsol ICSID Arbitration prior to its withdrawal.

Repsol’s Request for Arbitration Dated 9 June 2008

In its Request for Arbitration, the Consortium sought the following orders from the tribunal: (i)
that Petroecuador and Ecuador comply with the Participation Contract in accordance with its
original terms, i.e., the terms that prevented Petroecuador and Ecuador from requesting Law 42
payments; (ii) alternatively, were the tribunal to consider that the State’s additional participation
was a tax, that it be awarded compensation in accordance with clause 8.6 of the Participation
Contract; (iii) reimbursement of past and future Law 42 payments, plus the reimbursement of the
loss caused by low-production and the suspension of investments, plus interest; (iv) enforcement

of the final and binding Consultor’s decision so as to prevent Petroecuador and Ecuador from

3 See supra para. 97.

Page 123 of 173

requesting another payment (known as “Glosa”); and (v) compensation for an increase in a

transport rate.

396. Respondent has asserted in this arbitration that in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration the Consortium
also claimed for loss of cash flow.°* In support, it refers to paragraphs 119 and 134(iv) of the
Repsol Request for Arbitration. An examination of those paragraphs indicates that the purported

claim for loss of cash flow is far from clear.

397. Paragraph 119 of the request for arbitration contains the only express mention of loss of cash flow.

It reads, in full:

At the same time as the requirement for payment of the State’s Additional
Participation, Ecuador demands investments for the Contractor that are
incompatible with its economical possibilities. As such, in fulfilling is obligations
under the Participation Contract, the Contractor should allocate to investments
USD 7 million, equating 10% of its net profits for the year 2007. In light of the
destruction of the Contractor’s cash flow due to the imposition of the State’s
Additional Participation, the Contractor presently lacks funds of its own to make
these investments. Ignoring entirely the situation, Ecuador demands said
investments under threat of termination of the Participation Contract. In the words
of the President of Ecuador:

 

“T have already sent a very clear message to the oil companies. I am not
going to allow that: either they invest or, well, we will act in accordance
with the law. [ ] If they do not keep on investing I will take a different
type of measures. [ ] For each field that those transnationals have, there
are 500 transnationals interested.” °

398. Paragraph 134(iv) reads:

On the basis of what has been expressed in the present Request, and with an
express reservation of the right to expand the present request for relief, including
the right to amend in light of new measures adopted by Ecuador or Petroecuador,
the Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal:

(iv) ORDER the Respondents to pay the damages for the violation of the
Participation Contract in an amount to be calculated at a later stage of this
arbitration, including, but not limited to, the losses caused by each of the
established violations.”

399. Paragraphs 74 and 75(iii) are also related. They state:

74. In light of the foregoing, the Claimants are legitimized to demand from
Petroecuador and Ecuador the fulfilment of their obligations under the
Participation Contract as they were originally agreed and a compensation for the
damages suffered.

75. In the present dispute, this implies:

(iii) Additionally, the claimants are legitimized to claim, and they do so,
compensation for the damages suffered due to the contractual breach,
including but not limited to, the reimbursement of the amounts paid as
the State’s Additional Participation and the amounts that for such concept
they pay in the future in order to avoid the termination of the Participation
Contract, the equivalent to the losses caused by the decrease in
production and the suspension of investments, with the corresponding
interest.*

A portion of these claims was also being pursued in parallel by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID
Arbitration. At that time, Murphy still owned Murphy Ecuador,

Repsol’s Memorial Dated 17 December 2009

The Consortium filed its main memorial in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration on 17 December 2009.°°
This was approximately nine months after the sale of Murphy Ecuador. In the memorial, the
Consortium carved out from its damages claim the amounts claimed by Murphy in the Murphy

ICSID Arbitration for Murphy Ecuador’s Law 42 payments made before 12 March 2009:

First, payments by [Murphy Ecuador] before being acquired by Repsol YPF have
been subtracted from the payments made by the Contractor, because those
payments are being claimed by [Murphy] in the [ICSID Arbitration] — this means
a reduction in the amount claimed in this arbitration equivalent to 20 percent of
the amount paid by the Contractor.“

As mentioned, the Repsol ICSID Arbitration involved the Consortium’s contract claims under the
Participation Contract and, in the alternative, Repsol’s treaty claims under the Spain-Ecuador BIT.
Section III of the memorial addressed the contract claims and Section IV addressed the treaty

claims.

Section IILC of the memorial dealt with the claimants’ right to compensation for damages under
the Participation Contract. It referred solely to damages for payments under Law 42. In it, the
claimants submitted that the Ecuadorean Civil Code was the applicable law and that, with regard

to compensation for damages, pursuant to Article 1572 of the Code, the contractor had a right to

be compensated for damnum emergens (actual loss) and also for Jucrum cessans (loss of profits).'
In the following paragraph, the memorial stated that “[i]n the present case, the Claimants claim

the actual loss, which is constituted by all the amounts already paid by the Contractor as State’s

 

Additional Participation.”“”

The claimants in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration were only claiming actual loss, even though they
had submitted that under Article 1572 of the Ecuadorean Civil Code they could also claim loss of
profit.

Later in the memorial, the claimants specified that the damage they claimed included the payments
made under the concept of actual loss between 2006 and 2008, as well as the payments made (and

those that may be made in the future) under the Disbursement Agreement, plus interest.“

In the memorial’s request for relief section, the claimants requested that the tribunal: declare that
Ecuador and Petroecuador are jointly and severally liable for the payment of compensation for
damages arising out of Ecuador’s breaches of the Participation Contract (paragraph 377(c)); order
the respondents to compensate them in an amount to be updated as necessary (paragraph 377(d));
and, grant the claimants any other satisfaction the tribunal deemed pertinent (paragraph 377(d)).
In the alternative, Repsol requested that the tribunal order that Ecuador compensate Repsol for the
damages suffered as a result of Ecuador’s violations of the Spain-Ecuador treaty, in an amount to
be updated based on the future Law 42 payments to be made by Repsol (paragraph 378(c)); and
grant Repsol any other satisfaction the tribunal deemed pertinent (paragraph 378(d)).

The language used in the request for relief section is general. There is no express reference to loss
of cash flow or loss of profit. Express reference is only made to Law 42 payments. While
paragraph 377(c) could arguably capture a loss of cash flow or loss of profit claim, notably, there
is no mention of loss of cash flow or loss of profit in all of section III.C (which addresses Murphy

Ecuador’s claims).

4 Section IV of Repsol’s Memorial addressed Repsol’s BIT claims, subsection C of which sets out the damages
it claims for treaty violations. That section refers back to the section on damages for Participation Contract
violations (paragraph 373). The only difference is that the treaty claims only correspond to Repsol, and, from

408. Thus, the only express reference to loss of cash flow is in the request for arbitration. When
examined in context, that reference merely describes the Consortium’s difficulty in satisfying the
obligations to simultaneously make Law 42 payments and to continue to invest, rather than as a
head of claim in and of itself. Apart from that (and arguably the passing reference to Jucrum
cessans in the memorial), there is no evidence before this Tribunal that loss of cash flow was a
separate head of claim pursued in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration. The request for relief in the
memorial was not subsequently expanded beyond the Law 42 payments claim. There is no

indication that the claimants filed an expert report on quantum in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration.

The Repsol Settlement Agreement

409. On 23 November 2010, the members of the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, entered into

the Repsol Settlement Agreement with Ecuador, which provided the following:“*

Settlement and withdrawal from Arbitration.

As a consequence of the agreement detailed in these Minutes of Negotiation —
Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A., Amodaimi Oil Company Ltd. [formerly Murphy
Ecuador], CRS Resources (Ecuador) LDC and Overseas Petroleum and Investment
Corporation, and once the Contract Modifying the Service [Contract] has been
signed and is in effect, the companies and the Secretariat as well as the Republic of
Ecuador shall give written notice of this agreement to the Arbitral Tribunal hearing
the proceedings designated as ICSID Case No. ARB/08/10 so that the Tribunal may
proceed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 43(1) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules.

The Parties agree and confirm that all claims, counter-claims, demands, counter-
demands, and requests contained in the Request for Arbitration, Statement of
Claim, Memorial on Jurisdiction, Counter-Memorial, and any other communication
sent by the Parties as a consequence of the Arbitration or submitted by the Tribunal
or by ICSID, as well as any other correspondence to third-parties related to the
arbitration shall be withdrawn with prejudice and shall be kept confidential, such
that under no circumstances, shall any of the Parties disclose [them] without the
prior consent of the other Party."

410. On the same date, the members of the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, entered into the

Final Modification Contract.“ Article 29.1.2 provided that:

It shall be understood that in entering into the [Final] Modification Contract,
Contractor irrevocably waives all claims or demands or losses that it could raise

force of the present [Final] Modification Contract.“*

411. Article 29.1.3 provided that:

Contractor acknowledges [to] Ecuador [...] that [...] neither the Contractor nor its
related companies are owed anything by, nor do they, by any means, have anything
to claim therefrom, directly or indirectly, in connection with the Original Contract
and any of its previous Amendment Contracts, whether due to missed opportunities,
damnus emergens or lucrum cessans.°”

412. Article 29.1.5 of the Final Modification Contract provided that:

The Parties agree and confirm that all demands, counter-demands, claims,
counterclaims and requests, contained in the Request for Arbitration, Memorial on
the Merits, Memorial on Jurisdiction, Counter-Memorial, and any other
communication sent by the Parties as a consequence of the Arbitration or sent by
the Tribunal, or as a result of Case [sic] International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID), as well as any other correspondence to third-parties
related to the arbitration shall be withdrawn with prejudice [...]*°
413. With the execution of the Final Modification Contract, the claims brought in the Repsol ICSID
Arbitration were withdrawn and definitively settled. For the sake of clarity, claims not raised in

the Repsol ICSID Arbitration were neither withdrawn nor settled; they remained alive.
414. On the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that:

(i) Murphy Ecuador did not pursue a claim for loss of cash flow in the Repsol ICSID

Arbitration;

(ii) Consequently, no claim by Murphy Ecuador for loss of cash flow was ever settled by

the Repsol Settlement Agreement.

would have obtained in the absence of Law 42, from the date it sold its interest to

January 2012), and the purchase price that Murphy received from Repsol YPF; and,

(iii) interest on the two amounts.

1. Appropriate Standard of Compensation

A. Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that the standard of compensation should be determined by /ex specialis or, in

°53 Tt notes that the only lex specialis standard

the absence of such, by customary international law.
in the BIT is Article III(1), which sets out the conditions for a lawful expropriation and that the

Treaty does not define the standard of compensation for other Treaty violations.°

Claimant contends therefore that customary international law sets the standard of compensation
in this case. It refers specifically to the Chorzéw Factory case* where the Permanent Court of
International Justice (“PCIJ”) held that an aggrieved claimant is entitled to compensation that
wipes out the consequences of the State’s unlawful act and re-establishes the situation that would
have existed had the act not been committed.°* Claimant maintains that investment tribunals have
repeatedly applied this standard, including where the treaty breach is other than unlawful

expropriation.*”

418. According to Claimant, a finding that Respondent has violated any of the Treaty provisions that

658 &

Claimant has alleged in this arbitration would entitle it to full compensation,” “to put the investor,

Murphy, in the same place it would be in the absence of the unlawful acts.”°?

B. Respondent’s Position

419.

ay

It is Respondent's case that Article III(1) of the BIT only applies to expropriation. With respect to
Claimant’s non-expropriation claims, Respondent argues that the standard of compensation is the
actual loss Claimant itself incurred as a result of the wrongful acts. In support of its position,
Respondent cites several cases, including Feldman v. Mexico, S.D. Myers v. Canada, LG&E v.
Argentina, MTD v. Chile, as well as the ILC Commentary." Respondent submits that some of the

cases Claimant relies on actually support Respondent's position if read comprehensively.

420.

S

Applying this standard of compensation to situations where the claimant holds an investment
indirectly, Respondent submits that tribunals have measured compensation by reference to the
concrete impact of the State’s conduct on the claimant’s financial position as shareholder. This
may include the loss of the value of the shares, but is not tantamount to the losses suffered by the

subsidiary through which the investment is held.“ Respondent argues that Claimant claims for

In sum, Respondent contends that in the present case, the relevant standard of compensation is the
actual loss caused to Murphy’s financial position as indirect shareholder of Murphy Ecuador and
that this loss cannot be considered legally identical to the harm, if any, incurred by Murphy

Ecuador."

C. Analysis of the Tribunal

The Tribunal agrees with the Parties that it is not bound by Article III(1) of the BIT in its
determination of the appropriate standard of compensation in the present case. Article III(1) only
applies to cases of lawful expropriation, but is silent on cases unrelated to expropriation. In
particular, the Tribunal notes that the Treaty does not address the appropriate standard of

compensation in cases involving violations of the FET standard.

In the absence of explicit rules in the Treaty, Claimant proposes that the standard articulated in the
PCIJ Chorzéw Factory case should govern the issue. Respondent does not dispute the applicability
of this standard. The dispute between the Parties centres rather on the question as to whether the
standard entails an obligation of full reparation or requires compensation of the actual harm

incurred by Claimant.

In the Chorzéw Factory case, the PCIJ held that compensation should “wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have
existed if that had not been committed.”*® Under Article 31 of the International law Commission
Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC Articles
on State Responsibility”), the applicability of the Chorzéw Factory standard has been confirmed
and broadened in scope beyond the sphere of expropriation.*” Article 31 of the ILC Articles on

State Responsibility provides:

1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the
injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the
internationally wrongful act of a State. (emphasis added)

425. The violation of an obligation under international law by a State entails the State’s international
responsibility. The Tribunal is satisfied that the above principle of full reparation applies to
breaches of investment treaties unrelated to expropriations. This is reflected in the practice of
investment tribunals.° The full reparation standard aims at “full reparation”of the concerete and
actual damage incurred. It provides a large margin of appreciation to tribunals with respect to

4.57

the selection of an appropriate valuation metho With that in mind, the Tribunal examines

Claimant’s heads of claim.

2. Restitution of the Law 42 Payments

426. Itis not contested that Murphy Ecuador paid USD 118.3 million in Law 42 payments as additional
participation to Ecuador from May 2006 through March 2008.°' The main point of conflict
between the Parties is whether or not the amount of historical payments claimed must be decreased

to account for income and labour taxes as well as the “threshold of tolerable proportionality”.°”

A. Claimant’s Position

427.

a

Claimant rejects the contention that the USD 118 million payment must be reduced by the
applicable taxes.” To be fully compensated, Claimant says that it should receive the historical
Law 42 payments without any tax deductions; such deductions should occur (if at all) post-

award.°™

Murphy Exploration & Production Company ~ International v. The Republic of Ecuador
Partial Final Award
6 May 2016
Page 133 of 173

Claimant gives seven reasons for its position. First, a damages claim is a single transaction that
may or may not impose a year-end tax liability for the compensated party. Second, the deduction
of corporate income taxes from a damages claim poses a risk of double taxation. Third, while
corporate income taxes are recognised as a potential result of an entity’s transactions for a
reporting year, a damages award must be enforced before it can be considered concluded. Fourth,
income and labour taxes are to be paid to a tax authority and not “netted” out through a damages
award. Fifth, tax issues arising from an award should be dealt within the ordinary course of
business and not “netted” against the damages award. Sixth, the approach Respondent suggests is
akin to Murphy amending and re-filing its 2006 to 2008 tax returns to recognise additional income
and the corresponding additional tax liability and then paying interest to the tax authority for
having understated its taxable income in prior periods. If an award is taxable in Ecuador and if the
tax laws of Ecuador require the tax payer, i.e. Murphy, to attribute the award as income generated
in prior periods rather than income generated in the current period, then Murphy ought to amend
and re-file its prior tax returns. Finally, in any event, the SPA transferred all of Murphy Ecuador’s
tax obligations prior to 2009 to Repsol.°”*

Claimant contends that the additional participation it paid should be brought to present value at a
pre-award interest rate based on Ecuador’s external borrowing rate in US dollars.‘ It sets the pre-
award interest at USD 238.4 million. This is based on the weighted average yield of Ecuador’s
global bond, factoring in Ecuador’s default in 2008 and bringing each additional participation

payment to the expected award date of 1 August 2015, with interest compounded annually.°”

B. Respondent’s Position

Respondent submits that the Tribunal would have to find that Law 42 violated the BIT at both the
50% and 99% rates for it to allow Claimant to recover the full USD 118.3 million requested.® It
argues that a finding of breach at the 50% rate would contradict previous ICSID awards and

constitute an undue restraint on a State’s liberty to apply legitimate revenue measures.°”

Respondent clarifies that, of the USD 118.3 million in Law 42 payments made by Murphy

Ecuador, USD 58.9 million was paid at the 50% rate, while USD 59.4 million was paid at 99%."

431.

It is for this reason that Respondent submits that the amount of compensation for the payments
made at 99% should be adjusted by subtracting from it the part attributable to what would have to
be considered a lawful taxation measure.*! Applying this reasoning, Respondent argues that the
claimed amount of USD 59.4 million paid under Law 42 at the 99% rate needs to be adjusted by
subtracting USD 30 million, which is the amount that Murphy would have paid on the USD 60

decreased by any additional revenue payments the Tribunal might find acceptable under the BIT.
In this regard, Respondent suggests a figure between 50% and 99%, inclusive, arguing that

sovereign nations would enjoy significantly greater flexibility in terms of revenue measures and

 

that the Tribunal should find that the permissible figure is greater than 50%. This further

decrease would result in an additional reduction of up to USD 29.4 million.

432. Respondent states that, in a next step, the amount of historical payments must then be further
decreased by 36.25%, which is the aggregate tax rate that combines the Ecuadorian labour tax
(15%) and income tax (25%) that Murphy Ecuador would have paid in the absence of Law 42."
It asserts that the obligation to pay these taxes, as well as the applicable rules of computation, are

provided for in the Participation Contract. Respondent submits that Claimant does not dispute

Perenco was still generating significant cash flows and appeared to be quite profitable. 602. In
all of the circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal finds that Law 42 per se did not amount to a
breach of Article 4 of the Treaty.”

Burlington Decision on Liability, para. 433, CLA-233: “These facts corroborate the Tribunal's earlier conclusion
that Law 42 at 50% did not substantially deprive Burlington of the value of its investment, and was therefore not
a measure tantamount to expropriation”.

this fact and that this approach would be consistent with the most common valuation principles

and practices."

Respondent explains that the application of tax to the damages claim is justified because Claimant
should not be awarded more than it would have obtained in the absence of Law 42.“ It notes that
the amount of historical payments would have been taxed as additional profit and thus would have
been subject to Ecuadorian taxes before they would have been available for distribution in the

corporate chain in the form of dividends.*?

Respondent rejects the argument that Ecuadorian taxes should not be deducted from any amount
of damages awarded to Claimant because one cannot determine in advance to which extent an
award of damages would contribute to Claimant’s tax liability.° According to Respondent, the
argument is flawed because it assumes, first, that the taxes apply to Murphy, the present Claimant,
while, in fact, they apply to Murphy Ecuador. Second, the taxation would not be triggered by the
arbitral award, but by the profits Murphy Ecuador might have earned had it not paid levies under
Law 42.

For the same reasons, Respondent disagrees with the argument that applying taxes to the amount
claimed could result in double taxation.” The Ecuadorian taxes in question are those due by

Murphy Ecuador, not Murphy.

Respondent describes Claimant’s argument that Ecuadorian labour tax should not be taken into
account because the ultimate beneficiaries of the tax are the taxpayer’s employees as “devoid of
logic”. Even if this were true, Murphy would have no entitlement to receive amounts that

correspond with that labour tax absent any link to the employees of its former indirect subsidiary

Murphy Ecuador.°*

Finally, Respondent argues that the SPA, which provides that Repsol YPF shall be liable for any
Ecuadorian taxes imposed on Murphy Ecuador, should be disregarded, as Ecuador is not a party

to the Agreement and therefore is not bound by it.’

In sum, Respondent asserts that the maximum compensation due Claimant for the historical Law
42 payments made by Murphy Ecuador is no greater than USD 18.74 million (ie.,
USD 29.4 million (100% — 36.25%)).°° While this figure is based on 50% as a tolerable rate
for Law 42, Respondent clarifies that States enjoy significant flexibility in terms of revenue
measures, which should lead the Tribunal to determine as appropriate a permissible figure greater

than 50%.°°

C. Analysis of the Tribunal

For the reasons given below, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to compensation in the

total amount of USD 19,971,309 for historical Law 42 payments.

Claimant claims a total of USD 118.3 million under this head of claim. The Parties do not dispute
that this figure represents what Murphy Ecuador paid in historical Law 42 payments as a member

of the Consortium when it was owned by Murphy.

The Tribunal has determined that Ecuador violated the Treaty when it enacted Law 42 at 99%.
The Tribunal does not consider that Ecuador violated the Treaty when it enacted Law 42 at 50%.
The Tribunal finds that therefore Murphy is entitled to compensation for the historical Law 42
payments that Murphy Ecuador made at 99%. Murphy Ecuador paid a total of USD 55,986,233
of payments under Law 42 at 99% for the period November 2007 to March 2008.°* Murphy
Ecuador would have paid only USD 28,275,875 over that same period had Law 42 remained at

50%. The Tribunal finds that Murphy is entitled to compensation for the difference between those

two amounts, i.e., USD 27,710,358.

Respondent has argued that the Tribunal is obliged to subtract from the amount of compensation
for historical payments the payments the sum of which would represent a lawful revenue measure
in the circumstances of the present case.°” The Tribunal determines that it has achieved this by
subtracting from the total amount paid under Law 42 at 99% the amount that Claimant would have
paid over the same period under Law 42 at 50%. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to
determine any other “outer tolerable limit” between 50% and 99% that may justify a further

reduction in the amount awarded to Claimant.

Respondent submits that if Murphy Ecuador had not made the payments under Law 42, the
amounts would have counted as additional profits and thus would have been subject to labour and
income taxes in Ecuador.” Claimant does not dispute this. Respondent argues that to reflect the
true but-for scenario, any amount awarded to Murphy as compensation for Law 42 payments
should be reduced by labour tax of 15% and income tax of 25% with the aggregate rate of
imposition being 36.25% (i.e., 15% + (25% x 85)). It is Respondent’s case that the net economic
impact of the measures on Murphy Ecuador is what is relevant. Claimant objects to this on a

number of grounds as set out above.”

Claimant submits that a damages award is a single transaction that may or may not contribute to a
year-end tax liability.” Nor is it a concluded transaction. This is important, Claimant argues,
because corporate income taxes are recognised as a potential, consequential result of an entity’s
concluded transactions.” It also contends that to deduct these tax obligations from the award
would be like Claimant amending and re-filing its 2006-2008 tax returns to recognise additional
income and additional tax liability, and then pay interest to the taxing authority for having
understated and underpaid its taxable income for those periods. ™ The Tribunal accepts that yearly
tax calculations are based upon a range of factors present in a given fiscal year. However, the
Ecuadorian taxes at issue here apply to the profits that Murphy Ecuador would have posted had it

not paid Law 42 payments. The relevant fiscal years to which those figures apply are closed.

Claimant submits no evidence that the labour and income tax rates set forth in the Participation
Contract would not have applied over those terms. The taxation of Murphy’s profits as a result of

the present award is a separate matter.

445. Relatedly, Claimant argues that if corporate taxes were deducted from a damages claim, there
would be a real risk of double taxation.”°> Claimant, however, has not substantiated this assertion.
It has not furnished evidence to show that it would be obliged to pay taxes on a damages award
either in Ecuador, the United States, or another jurisdiction. Claimant relies on a NAFTA case in
which the claimant, Corn Products Inc., petitioned the tribunal in its NAFTA Chapter 11 case
against Mexico to alter its damages award from a post-tax basis to a pre-tax basis.” Corn Products
did so after discovering that the award was possibly subject to tax in Mexico.” Murphy has not
established what tax—labour, income or another kind—the present award of damages would
possibly be subject to, if any, nor in which jurisdiction, nor at what rate. The Tribunal is satisfied
that the amounts paid by Murphy Ecuador from 2006-2008 to Ecuador would have been taxed as

per the Participation Contract. This much is not in dispute.

446. Claimant submits that income and labour taxes should not be “‘netted’ out on paper through a
damages award” because this means that the specific party that would normally receive the cash
ultimately does not.” If labour tax were “netted” out against an award compensating the Law 42
payments, Claimant argues that the employees of the Consortium would not receive this benefit.
Rather, Ecuador would be the beneficiary of the labour tax deduction from the award.” The
Tribunal’s present analysis, however, is concerned with placing Claimant back in the position that
it was in but-for the unlawful conduct of Ecuador. The Tribunal is not concerned with the impact
its award would have on the employees of the Consortium, nor for that matter with the impact its
award would have on Ecuador. That is not part of the present exercise which is the calculation of
the quantum of Claimant’s loss. The Tribunal notes that if it accepted Claimant’s example, any

gain from not deducting labour tax from an award would go to the Consortium’s employees, and

not to Claimant in any event.

In two cases relied upon by Claimant, compensation was sought directly by the injured
company.”” The claimant party was directly subject to taxes unlike here where the shareholder
benefits from the operating company’s profits post-tax. It may in some cases be necessary to award
damages pre-tax to restore an injured company to its but-for condition. But that is not the case

here. To restore Murphy to its but-for situation, taxes should be deducted.

The Tribunal notes that under the SPA, all of Murphy Ecuador’s obligations to pay taxes arising
from prior periods of operation were transferred to Repsol YPF.”'' As Murphy is not a party to the
SPA, the Tribunal does not find that the arrangement between Canam and Repsol YPF is relevant
to the present analysis. Any claim for amounts arising from Repsol YPF’s obligation to pay tax

would have to be made by Canam from Repsol YPF under the SPA.

The Tribunal finds that it is appropriate to deduct labour and income taxes from the amount
awarded to Claimant under this heading. The standard of compensation that the Tribunal must
apply is full reparation such that Claimant is placed in the position it would have been in but-for
the breach. Not only should reparation wipe out all the adverse consequences of the illegal act, it
should also “restore the liabilities that were avoided but for the wrong.” The Participation
Contract provides for 15% labour profit sharing (clause 11.2.2) and 25% income tax (clause
11.2.3), and together, a consolidated tax rate and labour profit sharing rate of 36.25% (clause
11.2.4).75 Had Law 42 and its related measures not been enacted, labour participation and income
tax would have applied to the sums not paid. The payments would have been made by Murphy
Ecuador, not Murphy. Murphy Ecuador’s additional profits would have first been subject to
Ecuadorian taxes before being available for distribution up the corporate chain. It is only be
deducting these taxes that the Tribunal will put Murphy back in the position it would have been
but for the Law 42 payments at 99%.

financial impact of the Law 42 payments on Claimant, Respondent also took into account the
foregone profit of Murphy Ecuador that resulted from the monthly payments and brought it to a
present value as of March 2009.4 Respondent did so based on the fact that until March 2009,
Murphy bore the industrial risk related to oil and gas operations. After the sale of Murphy Ecuador
in March 2009, it did not. As a consequence of that risk, Respondent considered that each damage
component until March 2009 should not only consider the time value of money but also reflect the
industrial risk borne by Claimant. Respondent quantified this amount according to the expected
return of investors at a rate of 12%.” It considered that 12% was an appropriate proxy to reflect
the time value of money and the industrial risk associated with the operations of Murphy
Ecuador.”'° Claimant and its expert do not object to this aspect of Respondent’s damages

calculation nor do they address it in any detail.”

The Tribunal accepts that there was an industrial
tisk that applied to Murphy’s investment up until it sold its investment in March 2009. The
Tribunal accepts to apply the actualisation rate of 12% to the amounts paid by Claimant under
Law 42 at 99% until March 2009. From March 2009, the Tribunal will apply an appropriate

interest rate (to be determined in Section 4 below).

Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that Murphy is entitled to compensation under this head of
claim for the difference between the total amount paid by Murphy Ecuador at 99% for the period
November 2007 to March 2008 and what it would have paid over the same period had Law 42
remained at 50%. That amount totals USD 27,710,358. An actualisation rate of 12% applied to

715 First Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 107-109:

“107. The expected return of investors is commonly considered in businesss valuation through
the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (“WACC”), which represents the risk incurred by capital
providers for all business activities. Yet, the WACC of a company should not be systematically
used in valuing individual projects with special industrial risk. This is key in the oil and gas
industry, where the higher expected return of successful projects offsets the sunk costs of
unsuccessful exploration projects. This implies that the required discount rate (used to value a
specific oil and gas asset) is not the company’s WACC, unless the risks associated with a specific
asset are similar to those of the overall company.

108. It is therefore essential to check the appropriateness of the standard industry WACC before
using it as the actualisation rate (or discount rate) applied to a specific oil and gas project.

109. In light of the above, we considered it necessary to determine an actualisation rate that fairly
reflects the industrial risk associated with the operations of the Projects operated by Murphy.
Based on our experience, discount rates used for oil and gas projects generally range between
10% and 15%. These figures are supported by the 9-15% range and the 13.4% average derived
from external studies.”

that amount results in a total of USD 31,327,544. After a consolidated tax rate of 36.25% (labour
tax at 15% and income tax at 25%) is applied to the amount of USD 31,327,544, the total amount

of compensation due to Murphy under this head of claim is USD 19,971,309.

3. Lost Cash Flows from March 2009 to January 2012
A. Claimant’s Position

452. Claimant claims compensation for the difference between cash flows that its investment would
have earned but-for Law 42 and related measures and what it received from selling its investment
to Repsol in light of those measures.”* Claimant submits that, before the expiration of the
Participation Contract on 31 January 2012, it would have collected USD 354.99 million via

Murphy Ecuador if not for Law 42, which caused it to sell Murphy Ecuador.””?

453. To calculate these damages, Claimant uses ex-post data. Claimant submits that the but-for cash
flows should be based on actual oil production and prices for March 2009 to January 2012.77°
Claimant argues that the actual production of the Consortium from March 2009 to January 2012
(less the proceeds from the sale to Repsol YPF) best represents the actual loss caused by Ecuador’s
unlawful conduct and should be used by the Tribunal to re-establish the situation that would have

existed had the unlawful act not been committed.”!

454. Claimant refers the Tribunal to the AMCO Asia v. Indonesia,” CMS v. Argentina,” and Enron

v. Argentina”

cases in which the tribunals used ex-post information rather than an ex-ante
valuation to calculate damages. The tribunal in AMCO Asia v. Indonesia, when assessing damages
for an unlawful revocation of an investor’s license for a period of more than nine years prior to

the award date, relied on an ex-post valuation based on actual information on inflation, exchange,

105. It is important to note that, because Ecuador refused to produce actual data, Claimant does not rely on actual
information on production and oil prices. Rather, it relies on publicly available information and historical data to
estimate what Murphy Ecuador’s performance would have been between March 2009 and January 2012 (First

and tax rates during that time.”* The tribunal based its damages calculation also on predictions
made by financial experts on annual income early in the relevant period.”° In CMS v. Argentina
and Enron v. Argentina, each tribunal sought to establish the fair market value of the respective
investment at the time the injury occurred on an ex-ante basis. However, the tribunals relied on
ex-post data such as actual exchange rates and natural gas demand, in order to adjust imprecise

predictions made as of the valuation date.”””

455. From the actual proceeds earned between March 2009 and January 2012, Claimant deducts the
USD 78.9 million received by Claimant from Repsol YPF on 12 March 2009.”* Doing so,
Claimant argues, satisfies concerns about double recovery or the “reinvestment” of such
proceeds.” It rejects the contention that it is claiming “both the capital value of an asset and the
future cash flows the asset is expected to generate”.

456. Claimant contests Ecuador’s argument that Claimant itself caused its post-March 2009 losses by
voluntarily selling Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF.”! Claimant argues that the issue is not
whether Claimant sold Murphy Ecuador voluntarily but whether, in a but-for scenario without

Law 42, Claimant would have sold Murphy Ecuador; to this, Claimant answers no.”

457. Claimant states that the loss in value of its share capital in Murphy Ecuador equates to Murphy
Ecuador’s lost cash flows because Murphy indirectly owned 100% of Murphy Ecuador in an
equity-only structure (Canam being a holding company).”* It notes that tribunals have recognised
that damages to a company typically flow to the shareholder in direct proportion to its equity

interest in the operating company.”

B. Respondent’s Position

Respondent contests Claimant’s claim for the lost cash flows of Murphy Ecuador. It argues that
Claimant has failed to establish a causal link between Law 42 and the loss of these cash flows.
Furthermore, it characterizes the damages allegedly resulting from the lost cash flows as highly

speculative.”**

According to Respondent, it was Claimant’s voluntary business decision to sell its shareholding
in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF, which in turn resulted in the non-collection of the cash
flows.”° Among the other options available to Claimant was the possibility to renegotiate the
existing contractual arrangements with Ecuador, as the other Consortium members did, with
success. However, Claimant had forbidden Murphy Ecuador from participating in the
renegotiations.”"’ Respondent argues that no compensation is due when the loss is caused by the
acts of the alleged “victim”.”* Claimant cannot claim for Murphy Ecuador’s cash flows as they
were generated after Claimant sold Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF. In support of its position,
Respondent cites cases holding that a party cannot claim for losses suffered by a former subsidiary
after the transfer of that subsidiary to a third party.”

Respondent suggests that Claimant has suffered no loss from selling Murphy Ecuador to Repsol
YPF since it received consideration that was more than the but-for value of Murphy Ecuador’s
shares as of the date of the sale.”” It states, specifically, that the actual value of Murphy Ecuador
on the date of the sale included the USD 78.9 million cash paid by Repsol YPF plus the value of
Murphy Ecuador’s tax liabilities assumed by Repsol YPF. Respondent contends that the sum of
the two components results in an actual value of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009 that exceeds
its but-for value at the same date.’ It argues that allowing Claimant to recover the cash flows

that would have been generated by Murphy Ecuador had it not been sold would represent double

counting and result in unjust enrichment to Claimant.”

461. Even were Claimant entitled to claim for cash flows,”’ which is denied, Respondent rejects the

inclusion in Claimant’s valuation methodology of ex-post information, which it says

inflates Claimant’s damages claim.”

According to Respondent, if the cash flows were to be

determined on an ex-post basis, then the valuation of Murphy Ecuador would also have to account

for the ex-post gains generated by the settlement agreement with Ecuador.”* Otherwise,

Respondent alleges, Claimant would in effect be comparing “ex-post ‘but for’ values with ex-ante

actual values”, which is incorrect.”°

462. Respondent identifies March 2009 as the only appropriate valuation date.”” It refers to legal
authorities and investment tribunals”? for the position that damages should be valued as of the
date of the alleged harm. Respondent submits that “no ex-post information should be
considered”.”*° Similarly, Respondent's expert states that it is the prevalent standard in valuation
theory that an asset should be appraised on an ex-ante basis “to reflect the valuation position of a
willing buyer and a willing seller, regardless of subsequent information unanticipated at the date
of valuation”.”*! Respondent also cites the World Bank’s Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign
Direct Investment, which mandate compensation to be “based on the fair market value of the taken
asset as such value is determined immediately before the time at which the taking occurred or the

decision to take the asset became publicly known.””

Respondent rejects the production and investment figures used by Claimant to calculate its cash
flows.” It points out that the production figures of Repsol YPF for 2009 to 2012 include the
additional investments that the Consortium made, in view of the extension of its contract to 2018.
Respondent submits that under the but-for scenario according to which the Participation Contract
was set to expire in 2012 the Consortium would not have made these additional investments.’
As for the investment figures, Respondent alleges that Claimant declines to consider the cost of
investments made by the Consortium to achieve the actual production figures, with the latter
exceeding expectations for December 2008.7** It states, in other words, that Claimant uses the
higher production figures but declines to consider the costs of investment that permitted those

gains.7°°

Respondent also challenges Claimant’s calculation of lost cash flows on the following four
grounds.”*” First, it states that Claimant has provided no evidence of the actual amount of cash
flow that Murphy would have received, after first being received and used by Murphy Ecuador
and Canam.”** Second, it posits March 2009 as the appropriate valuation date, and states that
accepted valuation practice would exclude using information obtained after Claimant’s sale of
Murphy Ecuador once it had abandoned all industrial risks related to Murphy Ecuador.” Third,
Respondent submits that Claimant wrongly computes Murphy Ecuador’s lost cash flows on a pre-
tax basis, in manifest disregard of widely accepted valuation principles." And fourth, Claimant
fails to account for lawful revenue measures that Ecuador may have adopted in the but-for
scenario. In this regard, Respondent notes that the impact of such measures would have to be
deducted from the amount of cash flows for which compensation is sought if Law 42 were found

licit in respect of the rate of 50%."

Partial Final Award

C. Analysis of the Tribunal

The Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to compensation for losses suffered as a result of the
enactment of Law 42 at 99% which includes the losses it suffered from selling Murphy Ecuador
in March 2009 and not participating in the Participation Contract until the end of its term in

January 2012.
Causation

The Tribunal finds that there is a sufficient nexus between Ecuador’s breach of the Treaty—
increasing the additional participation from 50% to 99%—and Murphy’s decision to sell Murphy
Ecuador to establish causation. The reality was that negotiations between the Consortium and
Ecuador were being conducted in an increasingly hostile environment in which it was not possible
for Murphy to freely negotiate an arms-length deal. The terms proposed by the Government were
significantly less favourable to Murphy than the terms of the Participation Contract. Against the

threat of the process of caducidad (which would have forced Murphy to leave the country

 

without recovering its i or equi ), and the of coactiva
proceedings by the Government (by which the Government would seize Murphy’s assets in the
amounts it claimed were owed under Law 42), Murphy was being forced to accept the
significantly less favourable terms proposed by the Government. Murphy’s only other option was
to sell its share in the Consortium. In this context, Murphy’s sale cannot be considered
“voluntary.” There was an undeniable nexus between Ecuador’s conduct in passing and
implementing Law 42 at 99% and Murphy’s decision to sell. It was a decision forced by Ecuador’s

breach of the Treaty, taken by Murphy to mitigate its losses:

Because Murphy no longer wished to operate in such a hostile environment and
in an effort to minimize our financial losses, we sold our 20% share in Ecuador
to Repsol on March 12, 2009. As the sale to Repsol only mitigated the financial
damages Murphy suffered in Ecuador, Murphy and Repsol included in the sale
agreement a provision allowing Murphy to maintain its claims against the
Government in this arbitration in order to recoup all of Murphy’s losses caused
by Law 42.77

The Tribunal rejects Respondent’s assertions that Murphy “caused” the post-March 2009 losses
by its “voluntary” sale to Repsol YPF. The Tribunal is satisfied that but-for Ecuador’s breach,

Murphy would not have sold its interest in the Consortium.”

The Appropriate Method for Evaluating Murphy’s Loss
i. Analysis of Claimant’s different methods for evaluating its loss

468. Murphy’s claim for losses in connection with the sale of Murphy Ecuador has been articulated in

more than one way over the course of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and the present case.

469. In the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, Claimant sought compensation for the diminution in the fair
market value of Murphy Ecuador as of 12 March 2009 due to Law 42.” In order to calculate that
amount, Murphy adopted a discounted cash flow analysis assuming that Law 42 had not been
enacted, and deducted from that figure the purchase price received for Murphy Ecuador.’
Claimant’s projection of cash flow was based upon the free cash flow to equity formula, i.e., the
remaining cash available after all expenses, taxes, loan repayments, and interest had been paid by
the business.” The damages analysis focused on the anticipated production Murphy Ecuador
would have received through January 2012, i.e., an ex-ante approach. Like the present case, the
damages expert for Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration was Navigant. As concerns ex-ante
versus ex-post data, in its first report filed in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration on 30 April 2009, i.e.,
very shortly after the sale of Murphy Ecuador in March 2009, Navigant stated that:

[i]n instances where the valuation date for a fair market valuation is a historical
date, the valuation practitioner should not normally use hindsight (i.e., use
information or events that have transpired between the valuation date and the
current date that would bias the valuation) when conducting the valuation
analysis. Rather, the valuation. iti should _base_his i on
reasonable expectations as of the valuation date. This is because the goal of
establishing a fair market value at a historical date is to establish a price a willing
buyer and willing seller would have paid and accepted, respectively, for the
investment at that time. Therefore, hindsight which incorporates events or
information that could not have been reasonably forecasted at the valuation date
should be ignored.””’ (emphasis added)

“Murphy sold Murphy Ecuador to Repsol because of Law 42. But for the enactment of that law,
Murphy would have continued operating in Ecuador. Murphy did not agree with the terms that
Ecuador demanded in renegotiating the Participation Contract, especially under threats of
caducidad and coactiva. Murphy’s objections are well illustrated by the Government’s overtures
to Murphy in an attempt to persuade Murphy to remove itself and its objections so that a
Government deal with Repsol could be reached.”

470. At that time, Navigant calculated the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador to be
USD 93,226,473, based on the following formula: Net Income + Depreciation — Capital
Expenditures — Changes in net working capital — Loan Repayments."® This figure, less the
purchase price then calculated at USD 80 million, resulted in claimed damages of
USD 13,226,473.

471. Inthe same report, Navigant went on to state that:

The damages approach we have adopted in our report relies upon projections of
future crude oil prices and operating costs as of 1 March 2009. However, as the
arbitral process continues, actual crude oil prices and operating costs can be
observed during our projection period. We understand that the Tribunal may
consider it more appropriate to incorporate actual crude oil prices (particularly if
actual crude oil prices exceed those in our forecast) and operating costs into the
damages analysis as_they become known. Accordingly, we may update our
damages calculation in preparing our second expert report and just prior to the
hearing to accommodate this known information.” (emphasis added)

 

472. In Navigant’s second expert report filed on 29 January 2010, Navigant amended its ex-ante
calculation of the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador due to, inter alia, an error in its original
formula, resulting in a reduction of approximately USD 5 million in the fair market value of
Murphy Ecuador.”” It then offered an alternative fair market value using ex-post data in the form

of up-to-date crude oil prices for 2009:

[W]e have provided an alternative calculation of the losses Murphy has suffered
utilizing actual crude oil prices between March 2009 and December 2009 and the
revised expected future oil prices as of 1 January 2010. Given the rise in oil prices
since we produced our first report, it is logical in our view that damages should
be based upon this alternative calculation.””

473. The higher crude oil prices incorporated into Navigant’s alternative damages analysis and the
correspondingly altered operating costs increased the damages pertaining to the diminution in the
fair market value of Murphy Ecuador. The fair market value of Murphy Ecuador less the purchase
price, then calculated at USD 78.9 million, resulted in claimed damages of USD 51,476,735.””

474, In the present case, rather than seeking the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador but-for Law 42

(less the purchase price), Claimant seeks the lost cash flows it would have received but-for Law
42 (less the purchase price). Claimant’s calculation of lost cash flows in this arbitration is based
on the following formula: Operating Income + Depreciation — Capital Expenditures — Labour

Force Tax — Changes in net working capital.”

Rather than relying on ex-ante data, Claimant submits that the Tribunal should assess damages
based on what the Consortium actually produced and sold from March 2009 through January
2012, less the proceeds of the sale of Murphy Ecuador. Claimant now claims damages of
USD 354.99 million in lost cash flows (not including interest), which it submits it would have
collected through Murphy Ecuador before the expiration of the Participation Contract in January
2012 if Law 42 had not caused Claimant to sell Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF in March 2009.74
Claimant calculates this amount based on ex-post data and a but-for scenario assuming the absence
of Law 42, in which the Claimant would not have sold Murphy Ecuador and would have continued

to receive cash flows through Murphy Ecuador until 31 January 2012.7

In its calculations, Claimant does not discount cash flows to a date in the past, but rather takes the
cash flows as received annually at their nominal value.’ Claimant then applies interest to each
cash flow from the year it would have been received in the but-for scenario until the date of the
award.””’ Finally, Claimant deducts the actual sales price received from Repsol YPF for Murphy

Ecuador and interest thereon until the date of the award.”

According to Claimant, the discounted cash flow approach it used in the Murphy ICSID
Arbitration and the lost cash flows approach it uses now are different methodologies to calculate

the same losses:

The only difference between the DCF approach and the lost cash flows approach
is the information used to make the calculations. . . . In sum, both the DCF and
the lost cash flows approaches were used to calculate the same set of losses, i.e.,
Murphy International’s loss of the economic benefits of the Participation Contract
from March 2009 to January 2012 due to the forced and premature sale albeit
using different methods and available data, and at different moments in time.””

In its second report filed in this case, Navigant referred to this category of damages as “the

diminution in value (or lost cash flows) from March 2009 to January 2012.”"*°

ii. Analysis of R ’s method for evaluating Murphy’s loss

Respondent bases its damages calculation on an assessment of the fair market value of Murphy
Ecuador on 12 March 2009, at the time it was sold by Claimant to Repsol YPF.”*' In order to
determine the hypothetical value of Murphy Ecuador in the absence of Law 42, Respondent also
conducts a but-for assessment.” This assessment is based on a DCF analysis using 12 March
2009 as the valuation date.’ To project the cash flows expected to be received by Murphy
Ecuador in the remaining contractual period of the Participation Contract, i.e., between 12 March
2009 and 31 January 2012, Respondent relies on information that was available, or at least
ascertainable, for a willing buyer at the time of the valuation date.” Respondent’s calculation
does not take into account any subsequent events after the valuation date, including any rise in oil
prices and oil production levels.”* The future free cash flows thus determined by Respondent are
then brought back to the valuation date by employing a discount rate of 12%.”*° Finally, the actual
sales price received by Claimant for Murphy Ecuador is subtracted from the calculated fair market
value of Murphy Ecuador in the but-for scenario.”*” Applying a base case scenario in respect of
the underlying assumptions regarding the future business of Murphy Ecuador after March 2009,
Respondent arrives at a difference between the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of March

discount cash flows back to the date of sale, i.e., March 2009. By contrast, Respondent employs
a methodology which seeks to establish the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador at the time of
its sale to Repsol YPF, relying purely on ex-ante available data and applying a discount rate to all

future cash flows that are predicted as of March 2009.

The choice of the valuation methodology has a significant impact on the final damages calculation.
The applicable international law standard of full reparation, as reflected in the Chorzéw Factory
judgment and Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, does not determine the
valuation methodology.” Nor does the Treaty. Tribunals enjoy a large margin of appreciation in
order to determine how an amount of money may “as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences
of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that

act had not been committed.”””

Under customary international law, if an investor loses ownership or control of its primary
investment due to the breach by a host state of its international law obligations, the commonly
accepted standard for calculating damages is to appraise the fair market value of the lost
investment at the time it was lost, without taking into account subsequent events.”*' Although the
Tribunal has found that Ecuador breached the FET provision of the Treaty, the result for Claimant
was the loss of ownership of its investment. In this way, the outcome was akin to an unlawful
expropriation, for which the fair market value of the asset represents the “lower limit of the
award.””” Investor-state arbitral tribunals have frequently sought to establish the fair market value
at the time of the investor’s loss of its primary investment as a basis for the calculation of
damages.” It is also the prevailing approach in financial accounting to consider the ex-ante
appraisal of an asset as of a certain valuation date without taking into account subsequent

developments:

[...] the valuation professional generally should consider ‘circumstances existing
at the valuation date and events occurring up to the valuation date.’ Subsequent
events, i.e., conditions that were not known or knowable at the valuation date,
would not ordinarily be incorporated into a valuation [...] ‘because a valuation is

performed as of a point in time — the valuation date — and the events...occurring
subsequent to that date, are not relevant to the value determined as of that date.’””*

483. Some tribunals have held that an investor is entitled to a valuation as of the date of the award,
taking into account ex-post information.”* Claimant maintains that damages should be computed
as of the date of the award using ex-post information.”° The choice of the date of valuation is
inherently linked to the valuation method to be employed, i.e., a valuation based on ex-ante or ex-

post information.

484. This Tribunal determines that an ex-post approach is not appropriate in this case because the ex-
post data generated after the sale of Murphy Ecuador does not reflect what the situation would
have been in a but-for scenario. The Tribunal rejects Claimant’s assertion that the ex-post data is
“more relevant and reliable than the information available in 2009.”””’ While the hypothetical but-
for scenario can never be stated with complete certainty, based on what was known at the time of
breach, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is probable that Murphy would have
remained in Ecuador operating under the terms of the Participation Contract subject to Law 42 at
50% until January 2012. Murphy had made all payments due under Law 42 at 50%, albeit under
protest, and had exhibited no intention of exiting the Consortium prior to the implementation of
Law 42 at 99%, Five months after the introduction of Law 42 at 99%, Murphy stopped making
payments. This led to implementation measures by Ecuador (the commencement of caducidad
and coactive proceedings), failed negotiations, and eventually, Murphy’s decision to cut its losses

and leave the country.

485. The scenario that followed the sale of Murphy Ecuador cannot be compared in any meaningful

way with the but-for scenario that would have existed had Law 42 at 99% never been enacted.

First, Repsol concluded a Modification Contract with the State which specified transitory terms
for one year while the parties negotiated a longer term agreement. In November 2010, the Final
Modification Contract—a services contract—was concluded with a term until 2018. In light of

the extended term, Repsol made additional investments”*

which resulted in increased production
levels.”” Production results would not have been the same under the Participation Contract which
was due to expire within three years. Under the new contractual framework, the Consortium had
incentive to ramp up investment; under the old contractual framework, the incentive would have
been to wind down investment. In light of these fundamental differences, the Tribunal does not
find it appropriate to apply the ex-post data as submitted by Claimant to Claimant’s claimed losses.
Awarding economic benefit that was not known or comparable at the time of sale would not place
Claimant in the position that it would have been in but-for the wrongful act. Such a ruling would
replace what was an uncertain future with a particular outcome too far removed from the ‘but-for’

hypothetical.

The Tribunal finds that it is appropriate to employ a fair market value methodology with a
valuation date as of 12 March 2009, the date of the sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF. The
fair market value approach values an asset by considering its ability to generate future economic
benefits. Assessing future economic benefits allows one to determine the “free cash flows”
generated by the asset. It is also the only valuation method that allows for incorporating specific
business circumstances into the appraisal of free cash flows. The fair market value of Murphy
Ecuador as of 12 March 2009 was subject to the degree of optimism or pessimism regarding its
(limited) future in Ecuador as at that date. The Tribunal notes that there is a large degree of overlap
between the financial and economic elements used by Claimant to calculate loss of cash flow and

by Respondent to calculate fair market value.

The Tribunal is, however, cognisant of the fact that the fair market value of an investment may
not always reflect the damage actually caused by the governmental act and thus would not
constitute full reparation.“ Thus, notwithstanding the issue raised above concerning the

inappropriateness of ex post data in this case, the Tribunal has considered the information that

investments only. First Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 159, 162; FL-39 Repsol Reaches a Preliminary

became known after the valuation date.**! Specifically, the Tribunal has examined whether the
assumptions on the development of oil prices and oil production levels, on which the ex-ante
appraisal of Murphy Ecuador’s fair market value is based, should be adjusted in the light of actual
ex-post data. This approach is consistent with the general requirement for awarding damages for
violations of international obligations that any compensable damage must not be too speculative,

802

remote, or uncertain."” The Tribunal’s conclusion is that it is neither necessary nor justified to

adjust the ex-ante calculation of damages as of 12 March 2009, as explained below.

i. Ex-post information on oil pri

For the purpose of determining oil prices in the period between March 2009 and January 2012 as
a factor in the valuation of Murphy Ecuador, Respondent’s expert relied on forward quotations
for the commodities market crude oil reference WTI (West Texas Intermediate) as of March 2009
to which it applied historical discounts of the Ecuadorian crude oil reference Napo with respect
to WTI crude prices.‘ Claimant does not criticise this methodology as a means to predict future
oil prices. Claimant’s expert, however, submits that oil price projections as of March 2009 are
inherently uncertain and that this uncertainty can be removed by relying on the available ex-post

information on oil prices between March 2009 and January 2012.8

The Tribunal finds that, while a certain level of insecurity is inherent in any prediction of future
economic developments, the public commodities market futures display the relevant market
expectations precisely and can be ascertained without difficulty. They provide an objective
indication of the predicted oil prices on which a willing seller and a willing buyer for Murphy
Ecuador would have relied in March 2009. The fact that actual oil prices deviated from those
predictions in the period between March 2009 and January 2012 does not render the prevailing
predictions for the oil price market as of March 2009 speculative or unreliable for valuation
purposes. These deviations are typical also of other assets (e.g., stock of publicly traded
companies) that are typically appraised as of a valuation date without taking into account

subsequent developments.*°

ii. Ex-post information on oil production levels

In respect of oil production levels, Claimant’s expert submits that the higher oil production levels
between March 2009 and January 2012 realised by the Consortium should be taken into account
for quantifying Claimant’s damages.‘ Claimant explains that higher oil prices in the period
between March 2009 and January 2012 would have led to an increase in oil production levels,
which is why the historic pre-March 2009 production levels provide no reliable basis for the

valuation of Murphy Ecuador.*”

By contrast, Respondent submits that the Consortium’s actual oil production levels in the period
between March 2009 and January 2012 are no suitable comparator for Claimant’s oil production
in a but-for scenario because (i) they have been realised under the new contractual framework
adopted in 2009 and extending the Consortium’s operations through the end of 2018; and, (ii)
because they are based on significant investments made by the Consortium beginning in 2009.5°*
For the ex-ante valuation of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009, Respondent’s expert used forward
production profiles defined by Repsol YPF in 2007 considered until January 2012, before any

1 ions to 2018 were These production profiles assumed no new
drilling developments.*” Claimant has not criticised this approach as being unsuitable for an ex-

ante valuation of Murphy Ecuador.

The Tribunal finds that the projections of oil production levels submitted by Respondent’s expert

 

are reasonable and appropriate. Since they are based on Murphy Ecuador’s situation under the
Participation Contract without taking into account any subsequent investments in production
capacities, the forecasted oil production levels serve as more appropriate assumptions upon which
to base the valuation of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009 than the Consortium’s production
figures for the period between March 2009 and January 2012. It is highly speculative whether
these production levels would also have been achieved by Murphy Ecuador in the light of higher
oil prices or whether they are rather connected to the Consortium’s new contractual arrangements
including extended contract terms and subsequent investments in production capacities.
Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that it is inappropriate to rely on the Consortium’s 2009-2012

production levels for purposes of the valuation of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009.

Tribunal’s Calculation of Damages

As stated, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to calculate the damages for the harm Claimant suffered
through the enactment of Law 42 at the rate of 99% in connection with the sale of Murphy Ecuador
to Repsol YPF on 12 March 2009 and lost earnings after that time by way of comparison of the
fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of 12 March 2009 with the actual sales price for the

company received from Repsol YPF.

The Tribunal finds the Respondent’s expert’s calculation of the “but-for” value of Murphy
Ecuador in the absence of Law 42 is reasonable and convincing.*"° It is appropriately influenced
by assumptions on the application of a discount rate of 12% and the following four main drivers

of value (which are consistent with the elements used by Claimant to calculate lost cash flow):

i. the expected production of crude oil;

ii. the expected oil-market prices;
iii. the expected capital expenditures (“Capex”) and operating expenses (““Opex”); and
iv. taxes, levies and other liabilities.*"!

Each of these assumptions will be addressed below.

i. Expected production of crude oil

The Tribunal is satisfied that using the forward production profiles defined by Respol YPF in
2007—still under the Participation Contract framework and before effects of a new contractual
framework including extended terms until 2018 came into play—provides a suitable basis for
predicting future oil production levels.*!* The production profiles were considered until January
2012. Me , this prediction is not i by later ii in producti iti

made by the Consortium beginning in 2009.*!° The Tribunal concludes that the production figures

used in Respondent’s expert’s base case scenario are realistic.“

ii. Expected oil-market prices

The Tribunal finds Respondent’s expert’s predictions of future oil prices based on the objective

expectations existing at the commodities market in March 2009 as appropriate.
tii. Expected Capex and Opex

The Tribunal also accepts Respondent’s expert’s projections of Capex and Opex figures from
March 2009 through January 2012.8! It is appropriate for those figures to take into account only

the existing level of production capacities and the corresponding maintenance costs.

iv. Taxes, levies and other liabilities

 

The Tribunal accepts that the Consortium was subject to a variety of taxes and levies including
notably labour participation and income tax.*'* The Tribunal accepts the additional figures utilised
by Fair Links to calculate Murphy Ecuador’s various other liabilities under this heading (i.e., Law

20, Law 40, Corpei, transportation tariffs, VAT, and VAT reimbursement).

The Tribunal determines that the asset retirement obligation at the expiration of the project period
pursuant to the Participation Contract is reasonably estimated at a value of USD 3 million as of

March 2009 in Respondent’s expert’s calculation.*!7
v. DCF Computation of the But-For Fair Market Value

Based on these economic and financial assumptions, Respondent calculated the future free cash
flows of Murphy Ecuador between March 2009 and January 2012. To those values, Respondent
applied a discount rate of 12% (reflecting the time value of money and investment risk) to bring
their values back to March 2009. Claimant does not criticise this discount rate (Claimant’s own
methodology does not require the application of a discount rate). Respondent then derives the Net
Present Value of the cumulative free cash flows to determine the (base case) but-for value of

Murphy Ecuador at USD 87.8 million.*'* For the reasons given above, the Tribunal accepts

815 First Fair Links Expert Report, para. 143.

816 See supra paras. 443-448 for the Tribunal’s analysis in this regard which also applies here.

817 First Fair Links Expert Report, para. 145.

S18 In addition to a base case, Respondent calculated a high case (a production scenario where cumulative
production is 10% higher than forecast by Repsol in 2007) and a low case (a production scenario where cumulative
production is 10% lower than forecast by Repsol in 2007) (see First Fair Links Expert Report, para. 138).

Respondent's calculations.

The Tribunal therefore finds that the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of 12 March 2009

in the absence of Law 42 was USD 87.8 million.*!”

That amount is, however, arrived at by calculations based on a but-for scenario under which Law
42 was not implemented at all. The Tribunal has found that Law 42 at 50% was lawful, but that
Law 42 at 99% was unlawful. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that Claimant should be
compensated for the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador assuming that the wrongful act—i.e.,
Law 42 at 99%—did not occur, meaning that Law 42 at 50% would still have been in place at the
valuation date of March 2009. For Claimant to be restored to a ‘but-for’ scenario, the fair market
value figure of USD 87.8 million must be adjusted to account for the fact that Murphy Ecuador
would have continued paying participation under Law 42 at 50% if Law 42 at 99% had never been

introduced.

The Tribunal is not able to calculate that sum on the basis of the information submitted by the
Parties. The Tribunal directs the Parties to attempt to agree within three months from the date of
this Award on the adjustment that should be made to the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador of
USD 87.8 million to account for an ongoing obligation on the part of Claimant to make Law 42
payments at 50% (“Adjusted Sum”). The Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to any difference
between the Adjusted Sum and the purchase price of USD 78.9 million for Murphy Ecuador
(“Entitlement”). The Tribunal also directs the Parties to attempt to agree on the pre- and post-
award interest calculations that flow from the Tribunal’s rulings here and in the following section.
If the Parties fail to agree on any sum within that time period, the Tribunal will invite each Party
to submit, simultaneously and within a further month, a submission setting out that Party’s
calculation of the Adjusted Sum, the Entitlement, and pre- and post-award interest. The Tribunal

will then make the necessary findings.
4, Interest

A. Claimant’s Position

Claimant requests that the Tribunal award compound interest on the historical amounts claimed

at the yield reflective of Ecuador’s US dollar sovereign cost of debt until the date of an award.*°

81° Second Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 124, 126. The Tribunal notes that this sum is very close to the fair
market value estimated by Claimant in April 2009 in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, i.e., USD 93,226,473.

For the interest calculation, Claimant asks the Tribunal to assume an award date of August 201 5.21

Claimant further requests that the Tribunal award post-award interest at the same rate of pre-award
822

ce

interest, i.e., Ecuador’s external borrowing rate in US dollars, sompounded semi-annually until

the date of payment.*?

506. Noting that the vast majority of BIT tribunals have awarded compound interest, Claimant states
that “[c]ompound interest should be available as a matter of course if economic reality requires
such an award to place the claimant in the position it would have been in had it never been
injured.”*** Because “compound interest is the norm” in financing and commercial transactions,
Claimant alleges that awarding only simple interest results in a situation in which “the party
receiving simple interest is in essence making interest-free loans to the party paying the simple
interest.”*°*

507. Claimant rejects the use of the US LIBOR rate of 0.38%. It disagrees with the position that an
arbitration award is a “risk free” proposition. It explains that, in any case, LIBOR is not a risk-
free rate, but a rate charged between banks.*” Claimant also notes that LIBOR is not typically

available to investors unless the investor is a bank.°*

B. Respondent’s Position

508. According to Respondent, the interest claimed by Murphy is indefensible given that Claimant bore
no industrial risk in relation to Murphy Ecuador after March 2009.*” It submits, therefore, that the
pre-March 2009 interest rate should consider both the time-value of money and industrial risk,

whereas the post-March 2009 interest rate should account for the time-value of money alone

because Claimant bore no industrial risk from then on.**° It notes that, barring evidence showing

that but-for the breach of the obligation the aggrieved party would have invested the lost amounts

ina specific investment project, the only compensation for the passage of time should be the award
of interest at the risk-free rate.!

509. Respondent rejects the claim for compound interest. According to Respondent, “in the place of
compound interest at Ecuador’s external borrowing rate in U.S. dollars, the Tribunal should prefer
an application of linear interest at the US Libor rate” because, after March 2009, Claimant would
no longer be entitled to a rate of interest reflecting industrial risk, but only to compensation for the
time value of money and the U.S. Libor rate is “the most appropriate rate to account for the time
value of money”. *?

510. Respondent contends that an injured party does not have “any entitlement to compound interest,
in the absence of special circumstances which justify some element of compounding as an aspect
of full reparation.”** It alleges that Claimant has not presented special circumstances to justify

deviating from the general international law norm of simple interest.**

C. Analysis of the Tribunal

511.

While Article III(1) of the US-Ecuador BIT directs that in the case of a lawful expropriation
“[c]ompensation shall [...] include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of
expropriation”, the Treaty is silent on interest applicable to an award of compensation for breach
of the FET standard. In the absence of express stipulations in the Treaty, the Tribunal finds
guidance on the matter in Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which reads as

follows:

Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when
necessary in order to ensure full The _interest_rate_and_mode of
calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.

Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until
the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled. (emphasis added)

The Commentary on Article 38 provides that “[t]he awarding of interest depends on the

circumstances of each case; in particular, on whether an award of interest

 

necessary in order to
29835

ensure full reparation.
The Tribunal notes that its general power to award interest to Claimant is not disputed by
Respondent. The Tribunal deems it appropriate to award interest for damages so as to ensure full

reparation to Claimant.

The Tribunal has reviewed the practice of past tribunals on the award of interest and considers it
varied and inconsistent, falling short of providing clear guidance.**° However, it is well established
that the Tribunal enjoys a wide margin of discretion to determine the rate of interest applicable
and whether it shall be simple or compound in order to ensure full reparation to the damaged

party.”

As to the appropriate rate of interest, Claimant’s expert suggests that “the most appropriate rate to
apply is Ecuador’s external borrowing rate in U.S. dollar”.* Respondent argues that an
actualisation rate of 12% should apply to claims for the period until March 2009, while an award
of interest at a commercially reasonable risk-free rate, as reflected in the USD LIBOR rate, would

be most appropriate for claims after March 2009.5”

The Tribunal disagrees with Claimant’s proposition that Ecuador’s external borrowing rate in U.S.
dollar should be adopted. Embracing this view would mean that Respondent’s risk characteristics,
and not Claimant’s actual loss, would be determinative. This would run counter to the fundamental
premise of the notion of compensation, which is to restore the position Claimant would have

enjoyed absent the breach. The Tribunal thus finds

 

self in partial agreement with Respondent and
deems the award of interest based on the USD LIBOR rate most appropriate, as it, in the Tribunal’s
opinion, reflects the best approximate rate that Claimant would have had to pay if it had been

obliged to borrow the money.

In accordance with the practice in past cases, the Tribunal further decides that the prime rate has
to be increased by a few percentage points considering that only the most solvent and creditworthy
borrowers are able to borrow money from banks at the prime rate. To account for this fact,
Tribunals in recent cases have added up to four percentage points to the prime rate.” In the present
circumstances, the Tribunal similarly deems it appropriate to award interest at the rate of USD

LIBOR + 4% as the most reasonable reflection of Claimant’s loss.™!

 

In respect of the starting date (dies a quo), the Tribunal recalls Article 38(2) of the ILC Articles
on State Responsibility quoted above and notes that the general practice in investment arbitration
is to award interest from the date of the breach of the treaty. While the Tribunal has found that the
date of breach of the treaty is 18 October 2007, it determines the following with respect to the start
date for the accrual of interest at the rate of USD LIBOR + 4%:

i. Law 42 payments at 99%: the Tribunal has actualized the value of the payment paid
under Law 42 at 99% at a rate of 12% for a total of USD 19,971,309.00.7 The
Tribunal determines that interest on this amount shall accrue at a rate of USD LIBOR

+4% from 13 March 2009;

ii. Lost cash flow: the Tribunal determines that interest on the Entitlement shall accrue
at a rate of USD LIBOR + 4% from 13 March 2009, being the date of injury to
Murphy through its sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF.

Finally, the Tribunal must determine whether the interest shall accrue on a simple or compound
basis. The Tribunal takes the view that an award of compound interest is appropriate in this case,
as it most accurately remedies the economic loss actually incurred by Claimant and prevents the
unjust enrichment of Respondent. The Tribunal disagrees with Respondent’s proposition that, in
the absence of special circumstances, a general international law norm of simple interest is
applicable in investor-State arbitrations. A review of the practice of tribunals across the past fifteen

years demonstrates that compound interest is commonly applied. In this regard, the award in

Compaitia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. The Republic of Costa Rica (“Santa Elena”),
issued in 2000, has been aptly described as “a turning point in jurisprudence”. It articulated the

following principles, which the Tribunal finds apply equally in the present case:

103. [...] the determination of interest is a product of the exercise of judgment,
taking into account all of the circumstances of the case at hand and especially
considerations of fairness which must form part of the law to be applied by this
Tribunal.

104. In particular, where an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the
value of his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then became
due to him, the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in part, the
additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income

by it, been rei each year at generally p iling rates of interest.
It is not the purpose of compound interest to attribute blame to, or to punish,
anybody for the delay in the payment made to the expropriated owner; it is a
mechanism to ensure that the compensation awarded the Claimant is appropriated
in the circumstances.“*

 

520. Subsequent tribunals have repeatedly followed the Santa Elena approach, creating what has been

846

referred to as a form of jurisprudence constante“ in investor-State cases,’ including cases

decided under the US-Ecuador BIT.‘ The Tribunal is conscious of the fact that the majority of
these cases have found liability for unlawful expropriations, but notes that tribunals—in particular

in more recent cases—have also granted compound interest for the violation of other treaty

849

obligations.“ While the Tribunal is not bound by previous decisions, it does not consider it

appropriate to deviate from this established practice in the absence of special circumstances, which

521. As regards the compounding intervals, the Tribunal observes that there are no general rules.°°°

Most recent awards have favoured annual,**! semi-annual,** or even monthly*? compounding. In

this case. the Tribunal finds it appropriate to direct that interest be compounded on an annual basis.

522. Accordingly, the Tribunal awards pre-award interest as below:

is entitled to post-Award interest from the date of this Award until the date of payment at a rate of

USD LIBOR + 4% compounded annually. Post-Award interest is to be calculated on the Sum of

XxX. COSTS OF ARBITRATION
524. The Treaty contains no provisions on the allocation of the costs of arbitration in the case of a

dispute between an Investor and a Contracting Party.

525. Articles 38 to 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules address the fixing and apportionment of the costs of

arbitration.
526. Article 38 defines the “costs of arbitration” as follows:

[...] The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator
and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

 

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral

tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are
approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(ec) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if
such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the
extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of
the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.

527. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle
be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion
each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to
in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such
costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable.

A. Claimant’s Position

529. Claimant requests that it be reimbursed its costs for the jurisdictional phase and the merits phase,
or a portion thereof.**! Claimant submits that these costs were necessary, reasonable, and
appropriate given the complexity of the case and the amount in controversy, and this is evidenced

by the fact that there are no material disagreements between the Parties, and their respective costs

are broadly similar.“

530. Claimant further requests that the Tribunal order that the Respondent bear at least 70% of
Claimant’s jurisdictional costs on the basis that Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction “consumed
a significant portion of the first round of jurisdictional briefing, the entirety of the second round

of briefing, and the entirety of the hearing on jurisdiction”.*°°

531.

Claimant objects to the following cost claims of Respondent:

i. The witness travel expenses should be excluded—or at least the costs of Mr.
Guillermo Paredes—in light of the fact that Claimant did not seek reimbursement
for its own fact witness, and Mr. Paredes attended the hearing although Claimant did

not call for his cross-examination.**”

ii. Respondent’s claim for a portion of the salaries it paid to four of its internal legal
staff members at the Attorney General’s office. Claimant says that there is no
evidence that these staff members were retained for the sole purpose of working on

this case and those costs would have been incurred irrespective of the arbitration.“

Respondent cites Article 40 as providing that the “relative success of the parties is the dominant

factor governing an UNCITRAL tribunal’s decision whether to award costs in a proceeding”.**°

Respondent submits that some tribunals have considered other factors in apportioning costs
including the novelty of the issues involved (as a reason not to shift costs to the losing party) and
the failure of the claimant to succeed (as a reason for the respondent to recover its reasonable
costs).5

Respondent submits that regardless of whether the Tribunal awards it costs of arbitration it should,
at a minimum, award it costs for legal representation and assistance due to the significant costs
incurred that have been both reasonable and “commensurate with [the] complexity and breadth of

the proceeding to date”.**!

Respondent disputes Claimant’s argument that the Tribunal should award Claimant 70% of its

jurisdictional costs because Respondent’s objection consumed a large portion of the

dings.“ Respond that all of its jurisdictional objections were “based on a strict

construction of treaty terms” and it should, therefore, not be “penalized for advancing objections

that are well grounded and previously accepted by other tribunals”.*

C. Analysis of the Tribunal

 

i. Article 38(a): the fees of the Tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator

In determining the amount of its fees, the Tribunal has taken account of Article 39(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant to which “[t]he fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal shall be
reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject

matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case.”

Apportioning the Costs of Arbitration Pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules

Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. It also grants the Tribunal discretion to apportion the costs
otherwise between the Parties if it considers a different apportionment reasonable taking into

consideration the circumstances of the case.

Article 40(2) provides that taking into account the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is free
to determine which party shall bear the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
Article 38(e).

In light of the fact that Claimant has prevailed in full or in part on jurisdiction, liability, and
damages, the Tribunal determines that it should be awarded a significant portion of the costs of
arbitration enumerated under Article 38(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) as well as its costs of legal
representation and assistance under Article 38(e). The Tribunal orders Respondent to bear 75% of
the costs of arbitration under Article 38(a), (b), (c), (d) and (f) as well as 75% of the costs of legal
representation and assistance under Article 38(e) for a total amount of EUR 3,756,550.68 (i.e.,

USD 4,316,770).

The Parties deposited a total of EUR 1,150,000, in equal shares to cover the fees and expenses of
the Tribunal and the PCA. The remaining balance on the deposit is EUR 45,400.36. This amount

shall be reimbursed to Claimant to offset the award of costs against Respondent.
