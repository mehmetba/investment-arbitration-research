PROCEDURAL HISTORY

6. On 4 February 2014, Blusun, Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein submitted a
Request for Arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment

Disputes (“ICSID’) (the ‘Request’ or ‘RFA’). The Request was submitted pursuant to

' Blusun, Certificate of Good Standing (updated), 26 September 2013, 4 February 2014, 23 July 2014, Exhibit

* Notarized Minutes of Eskosol Shareholders, 17 December 2010, Exhibit C-150, p. 3. The Claimants
explained that Eskosol was created as an S.R.L. and then transformed into an S.p.A. in December 2010 (see

Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty (‘ECT” or ‘Treaty’).’ The Claimants allege
that their claim arises from a dispute between ‘natural person{s] having the citizenship
or nationality’ of contracting parties to the ECT, with respect to “Investments”
associated with an “Economic activity” in the energy sector in the “Area” of a
Contracting Party.’* The dispute concerns certain regulatory measures and judicial
decisions that allegedly had the effect of frustrating the Claimants’ investments in a
120-megawatt (‘MW’) solar energy project in the Puglia region of Italy (hereafter the
Puglia Project, or the Project). The Claimants argue that measures adopted
successively by the Italian Constitutional Court, by the Italian Government and by the
Commune breached the fair and equitable treatment standard set forth in Article 10(1)
of the ECT, and/or constituted measures ‘having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation’ within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the ECT.° The Claimants

estimate the damages suffered as a result of those measures at some €187.8 million.!°

7. On21 February 2014, ICSID’s Secretary-General registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration.
In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to
constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the
Centre’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration

Proceedings.

8. The Parties agreed to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with Article
37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators,
one appointed by each party and the President of the Tribunal appointed by agreement
of the Parties.

9. On 24 March 2014, the Claimants appointed Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of

Bulgaria, as an arbitrator. On 7 May 2014, the Respondent appointed Professor Pierre-

(a)

Marie Dupuy, a national of France, as an arbitrator. On 12 June 2014, the Parties
agreed to appoint Judge James Crawford AC, a national of Australia, as President of
the Tribunal.

On 12 June 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (‘Arbitration Rules’), notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal
was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, and circulated the
arbitrators’ declarations under Rule 6(2) of the Arbitration Rules. Mr. Benjamin Garel,

ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The first session of the Tribunal with representatives of the Parties was held by
telephone conference on 28 July 2014. During that conference, the Parties confirmed
that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection to the

appointment of any member of the Tribunal.

Also at the first session, it was agreed that this arbitration would be conducted in
English and that it would proceed in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in
force as of 10 April 2006. The Tribunal discussed with the Parties a previously
circulated provisional agenda and draft procedural order, and established by agreement

a timetable for this proceeding that was incorporated in Procedural Order No. 1.

Pursuant to the timetable established at the first session (which was amended on 28
July 2015, following letters from the Parties of 16 July 2015 and 22 July 2015), the

Parties made the following written submissions:

The Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits on 31 July 2014, accompanied
by the witness statements of Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein, and by the

expert report of Carlos Lapuerta.

(b) The Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits on 19 December 2014.

(c)

(d)

The Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits on 8 May 2015, accompanied by
the expert report of Paolo Marino, the rebuttal expert report of Carlos Lapuerta, and

the second witness statements of Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein.

The Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits on 16 October 2015,

accompanied by the expert report of Luca Benedetti.

On 22 September 2015, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Francisco
Abriani, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Benjamin Garel as Secretary of the

Tribunal in this proceeding.

On 23 October 2015, the European Commission (the ‘EC’ or ‘Commission’) filed an
‘Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party’ (the ‘Commission’s

Application’) pursuant to Rule 37 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

On 24 October 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations

regarding the Commission’s Application by 28 October 2015.

On 28 October 2015, the Respondent submitted the statements of Mr. Benedetti and

Mr. Bacchiocchi in their capacity as expert and fact witness, respectively.

On 28 October 2015, the Claimants submitted their observations regarding the
Commission’s Application, and requested that the application be dismissed. On the
same date, the Respondent submitted its observations regarding the Commission’s

Application, and requested that it be accepted.

On 30 October 2015, the Tribunal accepted the Commission’s Application de bene
esse and fixed 12 November 2015 for the filing of the Commission’s further
observations, without deciding at that stage whether the Commission’s written

submissions would be incorporated into the record.

On the same date, the Claimants filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the
admissibility of new evidence, specifically a further report of 2011 from Watson,

Farley and Williams.

On 4 November 2015, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimants’ request of
30 October 2015.

On 5 November 2015, the Tribunal ruled that the new evidence was admissible. As a
result, on the same date the Claimants filed the Opinion of Eugenio Tranchino, of
Watson, Farley and Williams, dated 20 May 2011. This document was submitted as
Exhibit C-357.

On 12 November 2015, the Commission filed a submission regarding the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims (the ‘Commission’s Submission’), while
purportedly reserving ‘the right to request leave to intervene also on points of

substance’ in the event that the Tribunal decided it had jurisdiction.

On the same date, the Respondent submitted further observations regarding the
Commission’s Application. The Respondent requested that the Tribunal ‘allow a
round of written memoires by the Parties, irrespective of its final decision as for the
intervention of the European Commission in the procedure’, and that the hearing

scheduled to take place between 30 November and 4 December 2015 be postponed.

On 13 November 2015, the Parties and the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing
conference in which they discussed arrangements for the hearing on jurisdiction and

merits, and issues arising from the Commission’s Application.

On 18 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, deciding to
postpone the hearing initially scheduled to take place between 30 November and 4
December 2015, and inviting the Respondent and the Claimants to submit their
positions regarding the Commission’s Submission by 22 January and 26 February

2016, respectively.

On 22 January 2016, the Respondent submitted its ‘position on the jurisdiction of the

Tribunal over intra-EU disputes’, substantially incorporating the EC’s views.

On 26 February 2016, the Claimants submitted their ‘observations on the EC’s amicus

curiae brief’ , rejecting the Commission’s Submission as to the substance.

33.

By letter of 10 March 2016, the Respondent requested ‘to discuss jurisdictional matters
and have a Tribunal decision on these, prior to any discussion on the merits of the

case.”

By letter of 16 March 2016, the Claimants opposed the Respondent’s request of 10
March 2016.

On 19 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, allowing the
introduction of the Commission’s Submission of 12 November 2015 to the record in
this proceeding pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the ICSD Arbitration Rules. In the same
order, the Tribunal reserved for a later date its decision regarding the costs incurred as

a result of the Commission’s application.

On the same date, the Tribunal also issued Procedural Order No. 4, rejecting the
Respondent’s request to bifurcate the proceeding and reserving for a later date its

decision regarding the costs incurred as a result of the Respondent’s request.

A hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held between 25 and 28 April 2016 at the

World Bank in Paris, France. Attending the hearing were:

34. On 24 April 2016, the Parties were notified that one of the arbitrators, Professor
Dupuy, had been admitted to hospital and was accordingly unavailable to attend the
rescheduled hearing. At the beginning of the hearing, on 25 April 2016, the Claimants
asked the other two members of the Tribunal to go forward with the hearing as planned,
noting that the Parties had already given their consent to proceed with the hearing in
such circumstances at paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order No. 1,!! which provides in

relevant part as follows:

... in the event of unexpected health or other serious issues concerning a
Member making him unable to be present, the other two Members shall
exercise their judgment as to whether to sit with two Members. The Parties
shall be informed of such circumstances beforehand.'*

35. The Claimants also noted that this hearing had already been postponed once."
36. The Respondent, in turn, noted as follows:

We also know, of course, the text of the Procedural Order No. |. ... in any
event, we do recognise that we are in your hands. My only point at this
stage would be: we are not speaking about one sitting of the Tribunal; we

"! Transcript, Day 1, 4:18 - 5:14 (Legum).
"? Procedural Order No. 1, para. 4.1.
° Transcript, Day I, 8:19 — 9:9 (Legum).

37.

40.

are speaking of the only hearing that we have, where we discuss everything

at once. Of course Professor Dupuy can read the transcript, but it’s

absolutely not the same thing as being able to dialogue, to see each other in

our eyes, to make questions one after the other, and to interact. It’s not the

same, And I think arbitration has a characteristic: the extreme relevance of

this phase is especially when you speak with the witnesses and the experts.

So for us, we do not feel that we really can proceed with the hearing without

one of the three members. It’s too important for him to be present to really

understand the way we discuss the case. So we would really oppose to that.

We are in your hands, so you take the decision of course."
In making a decision, the other two members of the Tribunal also considered the views
of Professor Dupuy, who agreed that pursuant to paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order
No. | the other two members of the Tribunal could proceed with the hearing in his

absence.

Moreover, the Tribunal noted that the Parties’ agreement, as expressed in Procedural
Order No. 1, is compatible with Rules 14 and 20(1)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

Acting in accordance with paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, and after hearing
the Parties, the other two members decided to proceed with the opening submissions
of the Parties and the hearing of witnesses but to postpone closing submissions until a
date to be fixed, when all members of the Tribunal could be present. The possibility
was left open that the Tribunal might recall one or more witnesses should Professor
Dupuy, after reading the transcripts, wish to put further questions. Subsequently, the

Tribunal informed the Parties that this would not be necessary.!

The President of the Tribunal communicated the Tribunal’s decision to the Parties as

follows:

This is obviously a regrettable situation, To postpone the hearing at this
stage would be a second postponement, as pointed out, and would involve
extra costs. On the other hand, the Respondent is in principle entitled,
subject to the rules, to a hearing by the Tribunal. But there has been
agreement between the parties in a quite carefully worded provision
specifically envisaging a situation in which unexpected health problems

'4 Transcript, Day 1, 6:15-16 and 7:2 —7:19 (Malaguti).
'S Letter to the Parties dated 13 May 2016.

supervene. One other consideration is that the members of the Tribunal
have many commitments, and scheduling another five-day hearing this side
of the summer is going to be difficult.

So the Tribunal has decided, in the exercise of the discretion conferred by
the rules, to go ahead, but to go ahead as a truncated Tribunal with a
truncated hearing. What we propose is that we would have the openings
today -- it is traditional in openings that there’s not detailed questioning, but
questioning more by way of clarification -- to hear the witnesses, and then
to adjourn. The hearing would therefore last for three and a half days as
scheduled.

We would then reconvene as soon as a date can be found for the closings,
which will enable Professor Dupuy to read the transcripts. If there is a
compelling case for a witness to return to the chair for questions from
Professor Dupuy, that can be done. So there would be a further hearing of
a day, or perhaps a day and a half, in which the closings would be conducted
in the presence of Professor Dupuy. That would enable him -- especially if
we schedule a bit longer for the closing -- to fully participate.

We think that that solution, subject to the comments of the parties, addresses
the problems so far as we can do so. It reduces the wasted costs of this
hearing. It makes it much easier for us to schedule a resumed hearing in the
next couple of months. I don’t know when that will be because we haven’t
been able to get in touch with Professor Dupuy, but obviously we will
correspond on that. It enables Professor Dupuy to participate fully in the
closing and to ask questions, and if necessary gives him a bit more time to
do that. Subject to the comments, that’s the Tribunal’s decision, unless the
parties have compelling reasons not to adopt that.'®

The Claimants stated that ‘the solution that the Tribunal has proposed is a reasonable

v7

one and we would endorse it.’'’ Following further exchanges with the Tribunal and

counsel for the Claimants, the Respondent stated:

Thank you Mr. President. We can start if you want. We spoke with our
principals in Rome; they were not so happy but the decision is taken. So
let’s go on.”

42. During the evening of 21 June 2016, the Secretary received an application from a
subsidiary of Blusun, Eskosol. Eskosol (now in liquidation and under the control of
an Italian liquidator appointed by an Italian court) sought permission to intervene as a
non-disputing party under Rule 37(2) of the Arbitration Rules. Eskosol had previously
commenced its own ICSID arbitration, as a subsidiary of Blusun, relying on the same
facts against Italy as Blusun has done. In short, it submitted that this Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction and/or the Blusun claim is inadmissible because the Claimants are ‘seeking
damages to which only Eskosol is entitled, which will cause prejudice to Eskosol, its

creditors and the Non-Party Shareholders.”!?

43. Having consulted the Parties and received concordant oral and written submissions

from them, the Tribunal rejected Eskosol’s application, on the following grounds:

6. The Tribunal notes that, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules, it “shall ensure that the non-disputing party
submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or
unfairly prejudice either party.”

7. The Tribunal also notes that Eskosol’s Application was submitted
extraordinarily late and that there is no excuse for the lateness. The
existence of this proceeding is public and has been known for a long
time. Moreover, Eskosol itself has been aware of this proceeding for
quite some time: it has initiated other ICSID proceedings against the

same Respondent and, as Respondent stated at the hearing,
Respondent offered to Eskosol to consolidate the two cases.

8. The Tribunal further notes that both parties agree that Eskosol’s
Application should be rejected on the basis that it would disrupt the
proceedings.”

The Respondent, in arguing for the rejection of Eskosol’s application, added that:

46.

According to Rule 37(2), a non-disputing party can be admitted if this is not
a party to the proceeding, or linked to this. As the Respondent has stated
when justifying its proposal for consolidation to the Counsels of both the
Claimants and Eskosol, and as it was reiterated in Italy’s letter to the
Tribunal of March 17" to answer the Claimants’ comments to its request
for bifurcation and information about request for consolidation, ‘Eskosol is
that very same company that the Claimants define as their Italian vehicle
for the purported investment in Italy.’ Eskosol could consequently not take
advantage of Article 37(2) because it pertains to the same business entity as
Blusun. As for international investment law, Blusun and Eskosol are the
same entity.7!

Neither Party requested post-hearing briefs, nor did the Tribunal see any need for them.

On 18 July 2016, the Claimants submitted an application for leave to introduce to the
record the decision on jurisdiction in the case RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited
and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.é.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain
(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30), dated 6 June 2016, as a new legal authority. After
having heard the Respondent on the Claimants’ request, the Tribunal admitted to the
record the new legal authority submitted by the Claimants as Exhibit CL-255 and
invited the Parties to submit observations on its content. The Claimants submitted
very brief observations on 18 August 2016. The Respondent submitted its

observations on 5 September 2016.

On 1 August 2016, the Claimants filed their submission on costs. The Respondent did

not make any submission on costs.

II. RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES
1. The Claimants’ request for relief

48. In their Reply, the Claimants requested an Award:

a. Declaring that the Italian Republic has breached its obligations under
Part II of the Energy Charter Treaty;

b. Ordering the Italian Republic to pay compensation corresponding to
the loss of investment made and to the capital gains that the Claimants
were unable to realize on their investments, in an amount to be proven
at the hearing but which the Claimants presently estimate to be EUR
187.8 million;

c. Ordering the Italian Republic to pay interest on the above sum from the
date of the first breach to the date of the award at the rate for three-
month Italian bonds, compounded monthly;

d. Ordering the Italian Republic to pay the expenses incurred by the
Claimants in connection with these proceedings, including professional
fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the
Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of
the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention;

e. Ordering the Italian Republic to pay interest on the sums awarded at
the rate for three-month Italian bonds, compounded monthly, from the
date of the Award until its full discharge by Italy;

f. Ordering that all sums awarded be paid to a subaccount established for
this case by the Fund for Lawyers’ Pecuniary Payments (Caisse des
réglements pécuniaires de la profession d’avocat) maintained by the
Bar of Paris, France (Ordre des Avocats de Paris);

g. Ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems
appropriate in the circumstances.”>

49. Inclosing, the Claimants reaffirmed these submissions:

The purpose of a closing statement is to review the evidence presented at
the hearing and to provide the parties’ views on the implications of that
evidence for the legal issues to be decided. This will be the principal focus
of our closing statement this morning. We will generally not repeat today
what we said in our opening or in our written submissions, except to respond
to statements made during the hearing. The Tribunal should bear in mind,
however, that we continue to rely on our prior oral and written
submissions.”*

2. The Respondent’s request for relief

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent requested the Tribunal as follows:

a. Decline jurisdiction to decide, as the Project does not meet the
conditions of an investment that can be protected under the ICSID and
the ECT.

b. Alternatively, decline jurisdiction to decide, as the alleged investment
was created in violation of the national law; of the national and
international principles of good faith; of the ECT rules on
environmental protection.

c. In a further alternative, decline admissibility of protection of the
Claimants’ alleged interests since these are barred from seeking relief
because of their unlawful conduct when constituting the alleged
investment.

d. Should the Tribunal decide to have jurisdiction on the case, declare, on
the merits, that all the claims of the Claimants, both under Article 10(1)
and article 13 of the ECT, are unfounded, since there completely lacks
any causal link between the challenged Respondent’s conduct and the
outcomes of the Project; that, in any case, the Respondent’s conduct
does not constitute a violation of such rules.

e. In this context, declare the witness statements as submitted by the
Claimants both in the Memorial and the Reply as unfit to prove
evidentiary facts since Mr Lecorcier and Mr Stein are party to the
arbitral proceedings, and the requests for damages not supported by
consistent evidence.

f. In the unfortunate event that the Tribunal were to recognize legitimacy
to one of the claims of the Claimants and recognize some form of
compensation to the Claimants, declare appropriate the calculations of

A.

the damage and the interest proposed by the Respondent, including for
calculation of interest.

g. However exclude from the amount of compensation the part of
contributory fault attributable to the conduct of the Claimants, whose
responsibility in the negative outcomes of the Project is far superior to
that in any way attributable to the Respondent.

Ordering the Claimants to pay the expenses incurred by the Italian
Republic in connection with these proceedings, including professional
fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the
Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of
the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID
Convention.”®

51. Inclosing, the Respondents reaffirmed these submissions:

Italy firmly believes that this hearing has fully demonstrated the
inconsistency of Blusun, Mr Lecorcier and Mr Stein’s claims. Therefore,
no wrongful acts have been committed by Italy. No violations by Italy of
Articles 10 and 13 of the Energy Charter Treaty have been proven. These
closing statements will be devoted to summarising what emerged in the last
hearing, underlying the reasons why the Respondent has no responsibility
for the failure of Claimants’ project. In any case, it has to be clearly stated
that the Respondent, even if in these closing statements it will not treat each
single point of its written submissions, does not renounce to any of its
arguments, which are entirely recalled here.”

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
52. The purpose of this section is to provide a brief account of the factual background to
the dispute. There are no major differences between the Parties as to the events
described in the section. There are, however, significant differences as to the legal

consequences of the actions taken and not taken, as will be seen.

THE 120 MW PROJECT

53. The dispute concerns a 120-MW energy project in the Region of Puglia, in the

municipalities of Brindisi and Mesagne (Province of Brindisi), Italy (hereafter the

5 Rejoinder, para. 285.

‘Puglia Project’ or the ‘Project’). According to the Claimants, the Project consisted
in joining approximately 120 photovoltaic plants to each other and to two substations
for connection to the national grid.”” Each of the photovoltaic plants had a capacity of
just under 1 MW.”* Together, the plants would have generated approximately 120
Mw.”

54. The photovoltaic plants included in the Claimants’ Project had been initially developed
by 12 local companies (special purpose vehicles or ‘SPVs’) under the aegis of local
investors. Between 2008 and 2009, these companies had acquired certain rights and
permits for the development of the plants. As explained in more detail below, these
were rights over the land where the plants would be built, construction permits, and

permits for connecting each plant to the local medium-voltage grid.

B. THE CLAIMANTS’ INVOLVEMENT IN THE PROJECT

55. On 23 September 2009, Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein, through a Swiss
company that they own and control named Energy Solution Concept (‘ESCO’),°
signed a non-exclusive memorandum of understanding with Oikonomia Dante &
Partners (‘Oikonomia’), an Italian consultancy firm. The stated purpose of this
memorandum was the development of three large scale projects for the production of
energy based on photovoltaic modules in Southern Italy.3! Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein
eventually decided to pursue only one of those projects: the 120 MW project in

Puglia.*?

56. Inorder to do so, the investors had to purchase the SPVs that held the rights and permits
for the development of the plants.*> They also had to build two substations to connect
the solar plants to the national grid, and medium-voltage grids (or ‘rings’) to connect

the solar plants to each other and to the two substations.

57. On 27 November 2009, Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein signed another memorandum of
understanding pursuant to which ESCO would grant a €758,000 loan to Oikonomia in
order to make certain down payments to the local developers,** and committed funds

for future payments.*°

58. On 3 December 2009, Oikonomia entered into a series of preliminary share purchase
agreements with the local developers who owned the 12 SPVs, and made partial

payments pursuant to those agreements with the funds facilitated by ESCO.*”

59. For the development of the project, the Claimants established a corporate structure
consisting of a Belgian holding company (Blusun) and two Italian subsidiaries: Societa

Interconnessioni Brindisi S.R.L. (SIB) and Eskosol.

60. Blusun was established by Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein on 10 December 2009 as a

holding company. The company was registered in Belgium on 20 December 2009.**

retained 50% of SIB’s shares.*' According to the Claimants, SIB’s primary role was

to build and manage the two substations.*?

to the Claimants, Eskosol was established as a holding company for the 12 SPVs; it

was also supposed to construct the 120 solar plants and the rings.*

C, THE ITALIAN LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR SOLAR PROJECTS AS
OF NOVEMBER 2009

63. One of the main legislative sources at the time the Claimants invested in the solar
project in Puglia was Legislative Decree 387/2003, dated 31 January 2004, which
implemented European Directive 2001/77/EC of 27 September 2001 on the promotion
of electricity from renewable energy sources in the EU internal electricity market (the

‘First Renewables Directive’).**

The First Renewables Directive was aimed at promoting the development of energy
produced from renewable sources. It provided, among other things, that Member
States should adopt national indicative targets regarding the consumption of energy
produced from renewable sources,*° publish reports regarding the achievement of the
national indicative targets every two years,” and simplify the authorisation procedures
for renewable energy projects.“* The European Commission, in turn, would assess the
cost-effectiveness of the incentives adopted by the Members States in view of the

adoption of a subsequent EU framework on this matter.*?

At the time of the Claimants’ initial involvement in the project, solar projects in Italy
were subject to national and regional regulations. The regulations cited by the Parties
in this proceeding concern (1) construction permits, (2) permits for connecting the
plants to the medium- and high-voltage grids, and (3) tariffs.*° These are briefly

described below.

Construction permits

At the national level, Legislative Decree 387/2003 established a simplified
authorisation procedure for the construction of plants powered by renewable sources,
according to which renewable energy projects need to obtain only a single
authorisation (called ‘Autorizzazione Unica’ or ‘AU’) granted by a joint conference in
which all relevant authorities participate to assess the application.5' The decree

required the AU procedure to be completed within 180 days from the filing of the

© Directive 2001/77/EC, of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Promotion of Electricity
Produced from Renewable Energy Sources in the Internal Electricity Market, 2001 O.J. (L 283) 33, 27

application.** Moreover, the AU procedure was subject to existing regulations

regarding environmental protection.*?

67. Solar plants with capacity below 20 KW were subject to a different, declaratory
procedure (the ‘Denuncia di Inizio Attivita’ or ‘DIA’). This procedure was
established by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 380 of 6 June 2001, which
entered into force on I January 2002.** The DIA procedure consisted in the
presentation of a declaration and supporting documentation by the applicant. Absent
formal objection by the competent authority (i.e. the municipality concerned) within
30 days following the application, the applicant was permitted to begin work.>> The
DIA authorisation was thus implicit, and the works had to be completed within three
years after the expiration of the 30-day period for objection by the municipal

authority.°°

68. The Puglia region also adopted laws and regulations regarding the construction of solar
plants. These included, in particular, Puglia Regional Law 1/2008 of 19 February 2008,
and Puglia Regional Law 31/2008 of 21 October 2008.5” Both regional laws allowed
the use of the DIA procedure for solar plants with a capacity up to 1 MW.°® They also
contained specific requirements for DIA applicants for solar plants to be built on
agricultural land.°? Regional Law 31/2008 added some additional requirements for

this kind of project: (a) the plot of land on which the plant was located should be at

least twice as large as the portion occupied by the plant; and (b) the portion not
occupied by the plant should be used exclusively for agricultural activities. Regional

Law 31/2008 also provided as follows:

Plants installed on the ground in an agricultural area which consists of lands
belonging to the same owner, or which is made up of several plots resulting
from the splitting of an area of greater extension carried out within two years
prior to the application, are considered as a single plant for the purposes of
calculating the maximum electric power for having recourse to the DIA
procedure.°!
The Respondent asserts that ‘the use of the DIA for plants of less than 1 MW was
excluded by the mentioned regional laws if the plants established on agricultural land
belonged to a single owner, or were part of a unitary project.’ It also claims that,
even though Regional Law 1/2008 did not include an express provision to this effect,

‘this has constantly been interpreted in this way.’

The Respondent notes that ‘these principles were reiterated in further measures of the
Puglia Region’, and inserted in the National Guidelines for the authorisation of plants

powered by renewable sources.

The Parties also refer to Circular 38/8763 of 1 August 2008. By this circular, the
Puglia department of economic development recommended that the municipalities pay
attention to possible connections between multiple declarations of the initiation of

activity, as oversights on the part of the applicants could have led to the use of the DIA

procedure for plants whose overall electric power exceeds the 1 MW limit set forth in
Article 27 of Regional Law 1/2008.°°

2. Permits to connect to the national transmission and local distribution grids

72. The national transmission grid in Italy is operated by Terna S.p.A. (‘Terna’). Most of
the local distribution grids are operated by Enel. Connection to the national
transmission and local distribution grids is regulated by the Authority for the Electric
Energy and Gas (the ‘AEEG’), The Claimants describe the connection procedure by
reference to two AEEG Resolutions: AEEG Resolution No. 28 1/2005 (also called the
‘GOAL Resolution’, which was in force between 22 December 2005 and 31 December
2008) and AEEG Resolution No. 99/2008 (also called the ‘TICA Resolution’, which
has been in force since | January 2009 to the present). Both resolutions addressed

interconnections requests for plants of less than 10 MW.

73. Under the GOAL Resolution, the applicant was required to submit an application and
pay a fee to Enel, which in turn would propose a solution to the applicant in order to
connect to the grid: this was called the ‘general minimum technical solution’
(‘Soluzione Tecnica Minima Generale’ or ‘STMG’). The applicant had to accept the
STMG within a certain period of time. Following the acceptance of the STMG by the
applicant, Enel issued a detailed minimum technical solution (‘Soluzione Tecnica

Minima di Dettaglio’ or ‘STMD’).”

Under the TICA Resolution, a distinction is made between applications to connect to
the medium-voltage grid and to the high-voltage grid. Applicants have to submit their
requests to the local grid operator and pay a fee. For requests concerning connection
of plants of between 100 KW and | MW to the medium-voltage grid, Enel issues an
interconnection estimate (‘preventivo di connessione’) valid for 45 days which the
applicant has to accept. The interconnection estimate also indicates the amount to be
paid for connection works. However, the TICA Resolution permits the

interconnection works to be performed by the applicant.”!

In the case of requests for connection to the high-voltage grid, Enel receives the
applications and considers how to connect the plant to the grid operated by Terna.”?
Enel also issues a STMG which the applicant has 60 days to accept. If the applicant
accepts the STMG, Enel issues the STMD and the parties enter a service agreement

(the ‘regolamento di esercizio’).”

Tariffs

Legislative Decree 387/2003 foresaw the adoption of decrees that would define ‘the

criteria for encouraging the production of electricity from solar source.’™*

Tt provided
that ‘[flor the electricity produced by photovoltaic conversion of solar energy, the
criteria would provide for a specific incentive tariff by decreasing amount and duration
as to ensure a fair remuneration of investment and operating costs.’”> The system was
subject to periodic reviews in the form of reports that were to be produced for the first

time in 2005 and subsequently every two years.”

77. Pursuant to Article 7 of Legislative Decree 387/2003, Italy adopted a remuneration
system for solar plants based on fixed rates (feed-in tariffs or ‘FITs’). This
remuneration system was first implemented in 2005, through the so-called First Energy
Account, and subsequently amended through the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth
Energy Accounts.’”7 These regulations provided that solar plants that became
operational by a certain date would receive feed-in tariffs based on the nominal power

of the plant, according to a scheme that would be valid for twenty years.”*

78. The Energy Accounts in force during the period between 2008 and 2012 were the
Second, Third and Fourth Energy Accounts.” These applied to solar plants that

entered into operation between certain dates, as follows:

(a) | Second Energy Account: applied to solar plants that entered into operation on

D. THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENTS

80. The Claimants describe a number of investments made in relation to the construction
of the two substations, the acquisition of the 12 local companies and land, and the

construction of the local grid.

1. The two substations

81. Prior to the creation of Blusun, SIB and Eskosol, the 12 local companies had obtained
the relevant permits for the connection of the plants to the distribution grid and for the
connection of the two substations to the national grid from Enel and Terna, the
operators of the distribution and transmission grids. The applications had been made
by Nico Energia S.r.1. (‘Nico’) on behalf of the 12 local development companies.** On

30 November 2009, the province of Brindisi issued two decrees granting Nico two

82. In December 2009, SIB finalized the acquisition of the land where the two substations
would be built.** On 24 February 2010, SIB signed a contract with Ansaldo Sistemi
Industriali S.p.A. (‘Ansaldo’) for the construction of the two substations.8? On 29
April 2010, SIB signed a financing agreement with UniCredit for a total amount of
€6,076,000,% and the construction of the two substations was completed on 13
November 2010 (the one located in Torre Mozza) and on 6 January 2011 (the one
located in Maffei).°!

2. The local companies and the land

83. Blusun completed the acquisition of the 12 local companies through Eskosol between
18 May and 23 July 2010, as Eskosol signed the relevant final share purchase
agreements.”” Prior to the constitution of Blusun, SIB and Eskosol, the 12 local
development companies had obtained land rights through land sale and purchase

agreements” and through a series of long-term lease agreements with land owners.°*

3. The local grid

84. From January to May 2010, Nico obtained authorisations from the Municipalities of
Brindisi, Mesagne and Cellino San Marco for the works for underground cable

connections.”°

85. In May 2010, Nico requested public easements on privately-owned lands to facilitate
the construction of ‘electric power lines to connect photovoltaic plants to the
distribution grid.’°° This request was published in Corriere della Sera and in Corriere
del Mezzogiorno, a national and a regional newspaper, on 11 May 2010.97 On 26 July

2010, the Province of Brindisi granted the requested public easements.*®

86. On 30 July 2010, Eskosol signed a purchase order for 370 km of medium-voltage

underground cables to be provided by Nexans.°?

87. On 2 November 2010, Eskosol signed contracts with Nuovapanelectric S.R.L. and

4. The construction permits

Between June 2008 and June 2009, the local development companies applied for DIA
authorisations for 119 solar plants pursuant to Puglia’s regional laws No. 1/2008 and

31/2008. The Respondent provided a map indicating the location of the plants.!°

The local development companies obtained 65 certificates of expiry, confirming that
the 30-day limit to raise objections had expired,'™ and 53 certificates of conformity,!°°
which stated that the construction of the relevant solar plants was in conformity with
the procedures set out in Regional Law 31/2008 and with general urban planning

instruments.

E. THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT DECISION OF 2010 AND THE REGULATIONS ADOPTED
THEREAFTER

91,

92.

In December 2008, the Italian Government sought to challenge the constitutionality of
Puglia’s Regional Law 31/2008 before the Constitutional Court. One of the main
grounds for the constitutional challenge was that, by permitting recourse to DIA
authorisations for solar plants with capacity above the threshold set out in Legislative
Decree 387/2003 (i.e., 20 KW), Article 3 of Puglia’s Regional Law 31/2008 (which
permitted recourse to that procedure for solar plants of up to | MW) contradicted
Legislative Decree 387/2003.!%°

On 26 March 2010, the Constitutional Court ruled that Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2,

of Puglia’s Regional Law 31/2008 were unconstitutional.!”

93. On 13 August 2010, the Italian Government adopted Law 129/2010 (also called the
‘Salva-Alcoa law’), approving Law Decree 105/2010. Law 129/2010 provided as

follows:

Article 1-quater Declarations of initiation of activity regarding the
construction of electric power plants based on renewable sources

1. The effects related to the authorization procedures based on [DIAs]
referred to in Articles 22 and 23 of the Consolidated Text set by the Decree
of the President of the Republic n. 380 of 6 June 2001, for the construction
of plants for the production of electricity from renewable sources, initiated
in accordance with regional laws, concerning thresholds exceeding the
levels set out in Table A of the Legislative Decree n. 387 of 29 December
2003 [i.e., plants with capacity above 20 kilowatts], are maintained,
provided that the operation of the plants starts within one-hundred and fifty
days from the date of entry into force of the present Law implementing this
decree.'*

94. On 25 November 2010, Watson Farley, acting as counsel for Eskosol, sought
clarification from the GSE as to the effect of Law 129/2010 on the plants that obtained
DIA authorisations between August and September 2008 and, in particular, on their
eligibility for feed-in tariffs.” On 3 December 2010, the GSE responded as follows:

If the plants referred to in the first sentence of paragraph 3 mentioned above,
i.e., those authorized between August and September 2008, comply with all
the requirements, including with the technical standards resulting from the
applicable rules, such as the decisions of the Authority for the Electric
Energy and Gas, and unless the competent administrative authorities should
rule in a different manner with regard to the interpretation of Article 1-
quater of the Decree Law 105/2010 approved, with its amendments, by Law
129/2010, it is held that admission to the incentives under the so-called
Energy Account is possible, in accordance with the relevant provisions of
the applicable legislation.!!°

95. On 15 December 2010, the Ministry of Economic Development issued a Circular

regarding the scope of Law 129/2010. The Circular stated as follows:

8 Legge 13 agosto 2010, n. 129 (Law of 13 August 2010, No. 129), Exhibit CL-67, p. 1.
‘© Letter from Watson Farley to GSE, 25 November 2010, Exhibit C-140.
"9 Letter from GSE to Watson Farley, 3 December 2010, Exhibit C-145.

30

[T]he provisions of article 1-quater are not intended in any way to have
effects with respect to so-called ‘consolidated’ legal relationships, ie.,
relating to those DIAs that have become ‘final’ since no longer subject to
challenge due to the expiration of time-limits to file an appeal in courts
and/or to submit extraordinary appeals to the President of the Republic.
These DIAs are therefore not subject to the time-limit for commencement
of operations of plants established by article I-quater above.!!!
According to Claimants, it was only the Circular which finally cleared up the

uncertainty arising from the Constitutional Court’s decision of 26 March 2010.

FE EsKOSOL’s EPC CONTRACT WITH SIEMENS AND CONTACTS WITH POTENTIAL
INVESTORS

96. On 29 December 2010, Eskosol signed an EPC contract with Siemens for the
construction of the plants.'!? The EPC contract provided that the plants would be built
in three phases: 30 MW should be connected by 30 April 2011, an additional 60 MW
should be connected by 31 August 2011, and an additional 30 MW should be
connected by 15 November 2011.!!3

97. Under the EPC contract, Eskosol was responsible for: (a) providing the photovoltaic
modules,'!* (b) purchasing or leasing the land where the plants would be built,!!5 and
(c) obtaining and maintaining the relevant permits and grid connection
authorisations.''® Siemens was allowed to propose amendments to the scope of work

in case of change in the applicable permits.!!? The EPC contract also provided that

98. On 29 December 2010, Eskosol also hired Energy One S.R.L. as director of works and

safety management for the construction of the 120 solar plants.!!?

99. On 20 January 2011, Eskosol and Siemens agreed to postpone the signature of the
annexes to the EPC contract until 28 January 2011, and the date for the first down
payment until 28 February 2011.'7° On the same date, Eskosol sent a notice to Siemens

requesting it to proceed with the works regarding the first group of plants.!!

100. On 26 January 2011 and 4 February 2011, Eskosol received letters from financial
investors showing interest in the Project and requesting information.'?? No

commitments of project financing were, however, obtained at this or any time.

101. On 28 February 2011, Eskosol failed to make the 20% down payment, and on 7 March
2011 Siemens suspended performance of the EPC contract and proposed conditions

for the works to resume.'*

THE ROMANI DECREE

102. On 3 March 2011, the Italian Government enacted Legislative Decree 28/2011 (the
‘Romani Decree’), which entered into force on 29 March 2011.'** The stated objective

of the Romani Decree was to implement Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of

a

Among other reforms, the Romani Decree established that the feed-in tariffs adopted
by the Decree of 6 August 2010 (the Third Energy Account) applied only to plants that
entered into operation before 31 May 2011! (and not, as originally established in the
6 August 2010 Decree, to plants that entered into operation by 31 December 2013).!7”

104. The Romani Decree also established that any solar plants to be built on agricultural
land would be eligible for feed-in tariffs only if the plant had a capacity of less than 1
MW and occupied less than 10% of the parcel on which it was erected.!?* This
limitation, however, did not apply to those plants that entered into operation within

one year of the entry into force of the Romani Decree (i.c., by 29 March 2012).!”°

105. As noted by both Parties, investors in the solar energy industry reacted against the
Romani Decree.'*° The Respondent notes that some investors sought to challenge it
by bringing administrative proceedings. In particular, it cites a decision from a Lazio
court which upheld the legality of the Romani Decree on the ground that ‘it seems

rather to implement a “fine tuning” oriented to proportionality and gradual[ness], in

full compliance with the directions of European law.’ >!

H. THE FOURTH ENERGY ACCOUNT

106. On 19 April 2011, the Italian Government made public a draft decree containing the

key components of the Fourth Energy Account. !3?

107. The Fourth Energy Account was adopted by Decree of 5 May 2011.'*° The Claimants
highlight three aspects:

(a) First, for the period between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2012, the Fourth
Energy Account limited to specific amounts the incentives available for ‘large

plants.’!*4

(b) Second, it created an on-line register of plants eligible for feed-in tariffs
administered by the GSE.'** Large plants that entered into operation on or before
31 August 2011 were automatically eligible for feed-in tariffs, while those entering
into operation between 1 September 2011 and 31 December 2012 had to be listed
in the register. Plants listed in the register would receive feed-in tariffs only if the
ranking in the register so allowed, based on the costs limits established in Article
4(2).'°° The deadline for submitting applications to the GSE register, for purposes
of eligibility for feed-in tariffs in 2011, was 30 June 2011.!97

(c) Third, the Fourth Energy Account established that, for the purposes of the
allocation of feed-in tariffs, ‘several photovoltaic plants belonging, or attributable
to, the same responsible entity and located either within the same or within

contiguous cadastral parcels of land shall be considered a single plant of a capacity

equal to the cumulative capacity of the individual plants.’ °* The plants’ capacity,

in turn, had an impact on the amount of the feed-in tariffs.'*°

108. Eskosol submitted all applications for the GSE register by 30 June 2011.!4°

109, In May 2011, Eskosol hired Capital Systtéme Investissements S.A. (‘Capital
Systéme’), an investment firm, to prepare a valuation of the Project for presentation to
potential investors. According to the valuation prepared by Capital Systeme on the
basis of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, the value of the Project

was €162,954,000.!4!

I THE GSE’s Lists

110, On 15 July 2011, the GSE published a list ranking the solar plants eligible for the 2011
feed-in tariff under the Fourth Energy Account.'*? The list included 115 of the 120

plants in the Claimants’ Project.'43

111. On 29 July 2011, the GSE published a new list, as the first one contained errors.'*4

This list contained 113 of the 120 plants in the Claimants’ Project.'*°

 

'88 Ibid., Article 12(5). Under Article 3, the term ‘Responsible Entity” was defined as ‘the entity responsible
for the functioning and maintenance of the plant, and who has the right to request and obtain the feed-in tariffs,
as well as the entity that requires inclusion in the registers referred to in Art. 8.”

112. The GSE subsequently published two more rankings, one on 12 August 2011!#° and a
final one on 16 September 2011.'*” As explained by the Claimants, the second list
published by the GSE was not final because, pursuant to Article 8(5) of the Fourth
Energy Account, solar plants initially included that became operational before 31
August 2011 would be excluded from the list and new ones were going to be added.'4*
The number of plants which were part of Blusun’s Puglia Project remained throughout
at 113.1

J THE PROJECT TO BUILD 27 PLANTS

113. According to Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein, in the autumn of 2011, Eskosol was in a
difficult financial situation. This led its shareholders to split the Project and build 27

solar plants (instead of 113) by the 29 March 2012 deadline. In their view, the sale of
those plants would have allowed them to purge Eskosol’s and SIB’s debt.!*?

114. On 7 October 2011, Eskosol received a preliminary non-binding offer from Euro
Catalysts Capital, proposing to purchase the 27 plants for approximately €67 million
on the assumption that 11 plants would be connected to the grid by the end of
November and that the other 16 would be connected by the end of December 2011.'5!

After receiving the non-binding offer, Eskosol negotiated a new EPC contract with

two local construction companies to construct the 27 solar plants.'*?

This agreement
provided that Eskosol assigned to its creditors the price that would be realized on the
sale of the 27 plants to a final taker.'®* In exchange, Eskosol’s creditors agreed to
waive any claims they had against Eskosol.'** Having reached this agreement with its
creditors, Eskosol still ‘had to convince Euro Catalysts (or other investors) of the

feasibility of the 27-plant project, in order to finalize a purchase offer.’ !**

115. Also in November 2011, Eskosol decided to start the construction of two of the solar

plants itself,'°° and it obtained a loan for that purpose on 18 November 2011.15?

K. THE MUNICIPAL STOP-WORK ORDER

116. On 17 November 2011, the environmental protection unit of the local police inspected
Eskosol’s construction sites. On 21 November 2011, the police communicated
observations regarding the inspection to the local prosecutor.!** On 25 November
2011, the local prosecutor informed the municipality of Brindisi that the situation as
observed by the police constituted a criminal offense violating zoning regulations.'*?

In his letter, the prosecutor stated as follows:

[G]iven the contiguity of the planned plants and their connection to a unique
centre of interests, it is obvious that the intent of the owners of this business
project was to proceed with an artificial division of several plants in order
to circumvent the procedure for the issuance of a construction permit by the
region.!°°

117. The prosecutor referred to Puglia’s Circular of 1 August 2008 and stated that it:

invited the Municipalities to adopt an attentive surveillance in order to
prevent the occurrence of this fraudulent division of a single plant into
several plants having an electrical power inferior to 1 MW. In light of the
above, I wonder what actions will be undertaken to revoke the DIAs.'*!

In fact, the Circular of 1 August 2008 provided as follows:

In consideration of the aforementioned circumstances, related to the
presence of a large number of DIA procedures before the Municipal
Authorities, it is recommended to the same to pay the maximum attention
to possible connections between multiple declarations of the initiation of
activity. Application negligence on the part of the applicants, when it is not
their unlawful behaviour, could support the application to DIA even in the
case of plants whose nominal overall electric power transcend the limits set
by article 27 of regional Law n. 1/2008.

Therefore, it appears appropriate that the Municipal Authorities pay the
maximum attention in verifying the existence of such situations, which for
example may be inferred from the significant recurrence of symptomatic
elements, such as a single point of connection, the uniqueness of the owner
of the areas, the uniqueness of the industrial initiative (derived from the
uniqueness of the applicants, or business contacts), and any other useful
factual circumstance to be gathered by means of inquiry.'®

On 19 December 2011, the municipality of Brindisi launched self-redress proceedings

in order to review the DIA authorisations held by three of the 12 local development

companies.!°?

On 11 January 2012, the municipality of Brindisi issued a stop-work order preventing
any further work on plants in the project under construction.'** However, on 13

January 2012, the Regional Administrative Court decided to suspend the effects of the

stop-work order issued by the municipality of Brindisi,’ and on 7 March 2012, the
Regional Administrative Court annulled for excess of power the decisions of the
municipality of Brindisi to initiate self-redress proceedings and to issue a stop-work
order. According to the Claimants, this was a Pyrrhic victory, because there was not
enough time to build the Project’s plants between the decision of the Administrative
Court of 7 March 2012 and the expiration of the 29 March 2012 deadline imposed by
the Romani Decree.'® The Regional Administrative Court’s decision is discussed in
paragraph 356 below: it drew a distinction between ‘the conditions stated at the time
of the submission of the application or ... the previous two years’ and ‘the need for the
requirement to subsist afterwards’ — in effect a distinction between fractionation of
holdings at the time of lodging the DIA (prohibited) and subsequent amalgamation of

holdings once the DIA procedure was complete (permitted).'

L. Law DECREE 1 OF 24 JANUARY 2012

120. This Law Decree provided that, as from 24 January 2012 (its date of entry into force),
solar plants built on agricultural land would no longer benefit from the incentives set
out in the Romani Decree. It also provided, however, that plants built on agricultural

land could still be eligible if:

(a) a construction permit was issued before 24 January 2012;
(b)the plant started operating by 23 January 2013; and

(c)the plant complied with the conditions set forth in Article 10(4) and (5) of the

Romani Decree (i.e., if they had capacity below 1 MW and occupied less than 10%

same owner, if they were located at least 2 km away from each other).'€*

121. The other exception foreseen by Law Decree 1 concemed solar plants installed on top

of greenhouses, provided that they occupied less than 50% of the total surface of the
rooftop.'

122. The Claimants contend that their plants could not comply with this regulation because
they were all built on agricultural land. Nor did they fall within the exception, as they

occupied more than 10% of the land on which they would be built.'”°

123. Law Decree 1 was subsequently ratified by Law 27 of 24 March 2012, which
introduced some changes to Article 65 of Law Decree 1 (‘Photovoltaic plants built on

agricultural land’).'7!

M. ABANDONMENT OF THE PROJECT BY THE CLAIMANTS

124.

On 5 July 2012, the Italian government adopted the Fifth Energy Account.'”” Messrs.
Lecorcier and Stein explored the possibility of transforming the 120-MW Project into
a series of single activities in order to benefit from the feed-in tariffs under the Fifth
Energy Account. They also tried to sell the two substations. But they eventually
decided to abandon the Project. Their decision was recorded in a resolution of SIB’s

shareholders at a meeting on 18 December 2012.5

127.

The Respondent’s position

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent raised an objection to the competence of the
Tribunal and the jurisdiction of the Centre on two grounds. First, the Project did not
qualify as an investment for purposes of the ICSID Convention or the ECT and instead
the Claimants’ activities qualified only as pre-investment expenditures of a speculative
74

character.'* Second, the Project was not a protected investment under the ECT

because it was constituted in violation of Italian law and the principle of good faith.!7>

The Respondent further contends that to the extent the Tribunal upholds its
jurisdiction, it should consider the Claimants’ claims inadmissible on the ground of

unclean hands.!7°

It is to be noted that neither in its Counter-Memorial nor in its Reply did Italy raise any
objection based on the law of the European Union or the suggested inapplicability of

the ECT in intra-EU disputes. Those issues arose only following the EU’s request to

5. Paragraph 4-bis of article 12 of Legislative Decree 29 December 2003, n. 387, introduced by
article 27, paragraph 42, of law 23 July 2009, n. 99, shall only refer to the construction of plants
fuelled by biomass located in areas classified as agricultural by the urban planning regulations.

file a non-disputing party brief, and they are dealt with below in that context (see
paragraphs 206-260 and 277-309).

1. The Project was not an investment under the ICSID Convention and
the ECT

(a) The ICSID Convention

The Respondent refers to the Salini test, as the ‘most widely invoked’ criterion to
determine whether there is an investment for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention.'”” According to the Respondent, the debate as to whether such test should
include the original four elements (i.e. a contribution of money or goods, of certain
duration, an element of risk and a contribution to the economic development of the
State) or whether it has now evolved to only three (contribution, duration and risk), is
immaterial for present purposes. The Respondent posits that under both tests, an
investment shall be assessed ‘within the context and according to the purposes that the
[host State] has set for the specific economic activity’ and by respecting the spirit and

text of its legislation.'”*

The Respondent contends that to determine if there is an investment past cases have
consistently considered that ‘the presence of an economic activity ... in the territory
of the host State shall be evaluated in the concrete case and in light of the specific
context.”!”?

Against this background, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ operations cannot
be considered an investment because they were not carried out for purposes of building

180

a PV plant benefiting from certain regulatory incentives. Instead, in the

Respondent's view, the Claimants’ activities ‘were carried out with the intent to sell

'8 Thid., paras. 285, 288.

N

the rights acquired to third parties to realize the investment.’!*! In particular, it argues

that the Claimants attempted to make a ‘financial transaction’ based on the sale of

999 182

acquired rights, ‘in a sort of “secondary market. According to the Respondent,

the Claimants alleged ‘investment’ was speculative in character.'**

. The Respondent also contends that the activities and operations carried out by the

Claimants shall be characterized as part of a ‘pre-investment’ phase.'** It alleges that
for an investment to be considered as such within the framework of the PV industry
incentives, the plants must be built (executed) and the Claimants must have submitted
an actual application for such incentives.'** However, in this case — the Respondent
asserts — the Project never reached the execution phase and the incentives were
considered part of the ‘hypothetical profitability parameters.’'S° Therefore, there is no

investment under the ICSID Convention.

(b) The ECT

The Respondent notes that the ECT does not protect any and all investments, but only
those associated ‘with economic activity in the energy sector’ in accordance with

Article 1(6). In particular, the Respondent argues that:

[a]ccording to the ECT, the investment [must] therefore satisfy two distinct
criteria: it shall be an investment according to the common use of the term
(and for this the non-exhaustive list applies as indicated in article 1(6),
letters (a) to (b)), and it shall be functional to the carrying out of activities
in the energy sector as listed. The genesis of the standard supports such
reading.!*7

‘88 Tbid., para.

In the present context, the Respondent alleges that the ECT protects ‘investments
actually intended for the construction of photovoltaic plants.’!** It considers that the
ECT protects those investments that ‘fit directly into the mechanism of production of
energy of the host country ... immediately contributing ... to the increase of plants of

alternative sources in the country.’'*

The Respondent further contends that the ECT distinguishes between the pre-
investment and the investment phase, and explicitly provides guarantees to investors
only for the latter phase.!®° It concludes that the Project does not fall under the

definition of investment under either the ICSID Convention or the ECT.

2. The Project is not a protected investment under the ECT

. The Respondent accepts that the ECT does not contain a clause specifying that

investments shall be made in accordance with the rules of the host state.'?! But relying
on the Yukos, Phoenix and Hamester decisions, it submits that even without such a
clause, the protection of investments under investment treaties, including the ECT, is

subject to the legality of the investment itself and the good faith of the investor. '°?

The Respondent contends that the alleged investment has been made in violation of
Italian law, both national and regional, and that it was made ‘in the knowledge of

circumventing these rules.”!°°

In particular, it argues that the Claimants violated Italian
law by artificially splitting the project, interposing 12 SPVs controlled by the same
people when having in mind one single project, and presenting one DIA for each plant

of less than | MW, despite some of the lands on which the plants were built being

contiguous.'** In doing so, the Claimants violated the Single Authorisation procedure
and circumvented the applicable rules of environmental protection for plants greater

than | MW.!°

The Respondent further considers that the Claimants ‘distorted the ratio of the
instrument of the DIA’ by not having the financial or other capacity to immediately

execute all the necessary work.'%°

In addition, the Respondent asserts that, even if one were to allege that the violations
were committed by the local developers, since they originally filed the DIAs, the
Claimants were fully aware of them.'?’ They contend, inter alia, that the Claimants
had full knowledge of the illegal acts and misrepresentations and that they should have
notified the public administration.'°* Moreover, relying on the Yukos decision, the
Respondent argues that, irrespective of who committed the illegal act, the alleged
investment itself would be affected by the unlawfulness of the procedures followed to

request the authorisations.'

The Respondent further alleges that even if the Claimants themselves did not commit
the above mentioned violations, it remains that they acted in bad faith when the 12
SPVs were acquired by Eskosol and all the DIAs were transferred en bloc to a single
project owner.”°° According to the Respondent, the Claimants had full knowledge that
this was an obvious violation of the law because the issue had been highlighted in the
preliminary due diligence report that Watson, Farley & Williams submitted to the

Claimants in January 2009.2"

140. Relying on the Phoenix and Inceysa decisions, the Respondent asserts that the principle

14

of good faith is recognized under both national and international law.* In the
Respondent’s view, the Claimants infringed the principle of good faith under
international investment law by evading their obligation to request an Environmental
Impact Assessment (EIA) in violation of Italian law, Article 19 of the ECT and general

principles of international law.2°

. Finally, the Respondent contends that there has never been acquiescence on the part of
the Italian administration, nor would the administration’s acceptance be a relevant

defence against the Claimants’ bad faith.?°*

3. Admissibility

142. The Respondent considers that the arguments summarized in the preceding paragraphs

also support its admissibility objection.?”

B. The Claimants’ position

143. According to the Claimants, the Respondent has failed to adduce any proof in support

202

of its objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione materiae and contends that Italy
has ‘ignore[d] evidence directly contradicting its position.’ According to the
Claimants, it is undisputable that there is an investment in this case. The investment
consists of some €40 million invested by Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein, the two
substations that Blusun’s subsidiaries erected and connected to the national grid, the

250 km of underground cables installed, the direct acquisition of local companies and

lands and the indirect holding of project authorisations and permits, as well as related

contractual rights.?°7

. The Claimants also allege that the record shows no bad faith or illegality, but rather an

investment that was made by ‘conscientious investors concerned with making a

positive impact on the local community.’

In addition, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s unclean hands arguments, alleging
that they are meritless in fact and law. They argue that the unclean hands doctrine is
neither a rule of customary international law nor a general principle of law, that there
is no express reference to it in the ECT, and that, even if it is applicable in law, there

is no evidence of it in the record.?”

1. The Claimants’ investments under the ECT and the ICSID
Convention

(a) The ECT

The Claimants contend that Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein indirectly owned and
controlled numerous investments within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT in
Italy. These include a controlling stake in Eskosol, 12 local development companies,
loans, parcels of land, two substations and rings, authorisations and permits,
construction and supply contracts, and the amounts derived from or associated with

these investments?!

The Claimants further argue that the definition of ‘Economic Activity in the Energy
Sector’ provided by the ECT is not limited to industrial activities, and that their

21

investments fall within that definition. They assert that, in any event, their

investment was a Project ‘of an industrial scale in a classic industry: the production of

electricity’,”!? and the fact that the Project was not completed due to Italy’s wrongful

acts does not deprive the investments of protection under the BCT.?°

(b) The ICSID Convention

The Claimants ‘do not accept that Salini defines the term “investment” where the
“consent of the parties” within the meaning of the ICSID Convention defines the term
for purposes of the dispute, as the ECT does here.’?!4+ In any event, the Claimants

contend that their investment meets the Salini criteria.*!°

The Claimants further contend that the Project is not less protected because it was to
be substantially financed. They assert that ‘ICSID tribunals have recognized that “it

999 216

is entirely normal for investment projects to be financed by borrowed funds and

that it is not uncommon for investors to finance construction in whole or in part through

217

loans from investors. The Claimants assert that the record shows that they

developed the Project and realized a significant part of it.?"*

The Claimants also argue that the Project was not ‘speculative.’ In their view, the
Respondent’s position is wrong as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. The Project
“was based on facts, scientifically ascertainable and verifiable.’?!° Also, the Claimants
say that, by arguing that speculative investments should not be protected under the
ICSID Convention, the Respondent would be asking the Tribunal to adopt a novel

approach to the Salini test, which includes the element of risk.??°

accomplished all of the main Project milestones but for the last one.*! In their view,
‘the fact that the Claimants’ project never reached the exploitation phase offers no
valid jurisdictional objection or defense to Italy.’??? In making this assertion, the

Claimants rely on the decisions rendered in Gold Reserve and PSEG.?>

2 Good faith and the Claimants’ investments

The Claimants assert that the authorities relied upon by the Respondent are inapposite.
The decisions in Phoenix and Hamester addressed the alleged general principle that
investments should not violate good faith and the host State laws only obiter.?* In
Hamester, the tribunal did not find that the investment had been obtained by fraud. As
to Phoenix, the tribunal was concerned with ‘the international principle of good faith
as applied to the international arbitration mechanism of ICSID.’?> In Inceysa, in turn,
‘there was ... “clear and obvious” evidence that the investor had acted fraudulently in
order to be awarded the bid and make the investment.’”°

The Claimants also note that there is no evidence in the record showing that they
artificially split the Project. In their view, they did not divide the Project but rather
united 120 small solar plants initiated by a dozen local development companies.?””
The Claimants also contend that the DIA authorisations were obtained in accordance
with Italian law, something that was confirmed by the Watson Farley due diligence

report and by the Administrative Court in Lecce in March 2012.7 The Claimants

. With respect to the alleged violation of environmental provisions, the Claimants’
arguments are threefold: (a) the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over an alleged
violation of Article 19 of the ECT because it does not fall under Part III of the ECT;
(b) neither the ECT nor other sources establish that environmental impact assessment
is a requirement of general international law; and (c) the Claimants were not required
to obtain an environmental impact assessment, since only plants with capacity above

1 MW are subject to a screening process and may be required to file one.?*

3. The clean hands doctrine

6. The Claimants contend that the ECT does not contain any express clean hands
requirement, and the Yukos decision does not support the Respondent’s ‘clean hands’
objection because the tribunal found that the investors there had clean hands.?**
Moreover, the Claimants assert that ‘clean hands’ is neither a rule of customary
international law nor a general principle of law.?** They finally argue that their hands

are clean, as there was no illegality in the acquisition of the 12 local development

VI. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES ON LIABILITY

157.

158.

159.

The Parties’ arguments on the merits concern the issue of whether the measures
adopted by Italy constitute a breach of the standard of treatment provided for in Article
10(1) of the ECT (requiring ‘stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions

for Investors’) or a breach of the expropriation provision in Article 13(1) of the ECT.
The Claimants’ position

1. The alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT

The Claimants contend that Italy breached Article 10(1) of the ECT in two respects.
They claim that: (a) Italy failed to create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent
conditions in the energy sector in Italy; and (b) Italy frustrated the Claimants”
legitimate expectations in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.*** The
Claimants rely on the Plama award to assert that these standards can be defined

autonomously,”*”

and they contend that the reference in the first sentence of Article
10(1) to promoting ‘stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions’ creates

binding obligations.”**
(a) Italy’s alleged failure to encourage and create stable, equitable,
favorable and transparent conditions
The Claimants contend that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT must be
interpreted according to Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of

Treaties, that is, in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to

the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.?>?
They argue that the words ‘encourage’ and ‘create’ imply both an obligation of means

and an obligation of result.74°

In particular, the Claimants argue that this obligation must be interpreted in the light
of the ECT’s object and purpose of ‘promoting best possible access to capital’,
‘formulation of stable and transparent legal frameworks creating conditions for the
development of energy resources’, and promoting ‘use of new and renewable energies

and clean technologies.’**!

The Claimants further argue that the obligation established in the first sentence of
Article 10(1) applies to all stages of the investment.” It also contends that, even on

Italy's own case, it would apply to the Claimants’ activities as pre-investment

matters.?47

In the Claimants’ view, the measures adopted by Italy cannot be reconciled with the

conditions that Italy ‘was obligated to encourage and create under Article 10(1).’24

The Claimants assert that the events should be considered in the aggregate rather than

245

as isolated acts.’ They complain specifically about the following measures, which,

in their view, ‘followed one another in a relatively short timeframe and deeply

destabilized the Italian solar market’ :™*°

(a) the Constitutional Court’s decision of March 2010, which failed to specify its

effects on pre-existing authorisations. In the Claimants’ view, this decision had

7 as it showed

a negative effect on potential debt and/or equity investors,”*
uncertainty as to the decision’s impact on DIA authorisations.”* They contend
that if the decision had been clear, there would have been no need for the
adoption of Law 129/2010, and that the GSE’s response to Watson Farley’s

request was not clear, so the uncertainty remained until December 2010;74?

(b) the Romani Decree, which in the Claimants’ view constituted ‘a sudden and
important change in approach for solar projects in development.’*°° The
Claimants complain about the changes operated by the Romani Decree with
respect to the Third Energy Account. They also allege that the Romani Decree
signaled that a new and different energy account would soon come into
existence, and that therefore no investor was willing to commit funding until the

applicable tariffs were published;”*!

(c) the Fourth Energy Account, which in the Claimants’ view was implemented in
a way that prolonged uncertainty due to the publication of several lists, and

which disrupted its negotiations with potential investors;?** and

(d) _ the inspections that started in November 2011 and led to the stop-work order of
11 January 2012.75

(b) _ Italy’s alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard

treatment standard is the protection of the investor’s reasonable and legitimate

expectations.’ They argue that legitimate expectations are established where the
following requirements are met: (a) the authorities of the host State made explicit or
implicit representations; (b) such representations were relied upon by the investor in

making the investment; and (c) the investor's expectations were legitimate and

255

reasonable in the circumstances of the case. The Claimants argue that these

requirements are met in the present case.

164. The Claimants also argue that stability and transparency are essential elements of the

fair and equitable treatment standard.?>°

165. The Claimants allege that the Italian Government made multiple representations ‘that
the construction of specific plants was “in accordance with the procedures set out in
Regional Law n. 31/2008 and with general urban planning instruments.”’**” They also
argue that for at least two years after having granted the DIA authorisations, the
municipality ‘took no step to suggest that it had any doubt about the validity of the

authorisations it had granted.’25* This, in the Claimants’ view, amounted to an implicit

9

representation that gave rise to legitimate expectations.?* The Claimants further

contend that Italy represented, in the Second Energy Account, that it would gradually

change the level of feed-in tariffs every two years.7°°

166. The Claimants assert that they relied on these representations, as they ‘committed the
bulk of their funds only after Watson Farley had conducted a due diligence review of

the authorizations for the plants.’?!

167. In the Claimants’ view, their expectations were reasonable under the circumstances.
They contend that Italy adopted measures that contradicted the representations it had
made and frustrated their investments. In particular, the Claimants assert that the stop-
work order ‘was contrary to the very regional law with which [the municipality of
Brindisi] had previously certified [the construction of the solar plant’s] compliance.’*°

The Claimants also argue that by the time the order was annulled by the Regional

Administrative Court, ‘no part of the project could be completed before the deadline

imposed by the Romani Decree of 29 March 2012.’

168. The Claimants also contend that the Romani Decree breached their legitimate
expectations by putting a sudden and premature end to the Third Energy Account,
which was to apply until 31 December 2013.74 In the Claimants’ view, the Romani

Decree prevented them from securing the additional investment needed.?°5

2. The alleged breach of Article 13 of the ECT

169. The Claimants stress that Article 13(1) of the ECT covers both direct and indirect
forms of expropriation, and they assert that their investments were subjected to

measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation within the

meaning of Article 13(1).”° They argue that ‘[fJor purposes of indirect expropriation,
what needs to be taken into account is the effect of the measure’ on the investor’s
property.”*” In their view, it is not necessary to prove that the measure tantamount to
expropriation is to the obvious benefit of the host State, as long as it has ‘the effect of
depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-

expected economic benefit of property.’?°*

170. The Claimants contend that the investments they made were acquired for purposes of

B.

the 120 MW Project. They argue that, as a result of the measures adopted by Italy, the
land can no longer be used for that purpose, the underground cables connect nothing,
the substations are disconnected and serve no purpose, the authorisations are now
invalid or useless, and there is no other possible economic use for these assets.7©° The
Claimants note that Eskosol is now the subject of a bankruptcy order and that SIB and
the local development companies are in liquidation.” In the Claimants’ view, the
effect of these measures is ‘indistinguishable from that of nationalization or

expropriation without compensation.’?7!

relations between Contracting States and not directly enforceable by investors.’?”?
Italy argues that the vagueness of the words ‘encourage’, ‘equitable’ and ‘favourable’

raises doubt on the existence of a specific obligation enforceable by the investor.””>

Italy further contends that the use of the phrase ‘to make investments’ qualifies and
limits the scope of application of the regulation, which would be actually aimed at
attracting investment.” As such, the obligation would be placed ‘in a phase preceding
the beginning of the foreign investment itself, thus before the same right to act arises
for the investor.’*”> In Italy’s view, its position would be confirmed by the definition
contained in Article 1(8) of the ECT, which provides that ““Make Investments” or
“Making of Investments” means establishing new Investments, acquiring all or part of

existing Investments or moving into different fields of Investment activity.’?”°

. The Respondent thus rejects all of the arguments made by the Claimants as to the

alleged violation of the first sentence of Article 10(1).?””

(b) Italy’s alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard
The Respondent’s main argument on the merits is that there is no causal link between
the State’s conduct and the failure of the Claimants’ business initiative, and that
therefore any further analysis in terms of legitimate expectations and fair and equitable

treatment is ‘superfluous.’2”* The Respondent also argues that the expectations alleged

that ‘[i]f itis true that the second sentence [of Article 10(1)] is strictly related to the first, this does not prevent
the second sentence from having a different normative force, that is being specifically binding and directly
enforceable by the investor.’ (para. 375). Rejoinder, para. 96.

by the Claimants are not legitimate and that the regulations adopted by the State were

reasonable.?”?

(i) The absence of a link between the State’s conduct and the
failure of the Project

. As a preliminary matter, the Respondent asserts that demonstrating regulatory

uncertainty is not enough to prove the existence of that link. In its view, the Claimants
would need to show that the alleged regulatory uncertainty is ‘indeed likely to
discourage investors’, and that the State’s conduct had a concrete negative impact on

the participation of third-party investors.?*°

With respect to the Constitutional Court’s 26 March 2010 decision, the Respondent
notes that it ‘did not manifest itself suddenly.’?*! It contends that the alleged situation
of legal uncertainty ‘should be referred to the date on which the law was challenged.’?*?
That date is December 2008, and not 2009 as indicated by the Claimants in the
Memorial.” The Respondent thus asserts that ‘it is not logically possible to argue that
third-party investors in 2010 were discouraged by an alleged uncertainty that dated
back to the end of 2008.’?** Furthermore, the Respondent explains that, under Italian
law, the declaration of unconstitutionality of a law cannot affect acquired rights, so ‘it
cannot even be affirmed that after the decision there was a situation of uncertainty

regarding these DIAs.’**5

Regarding the alleged uncertainty created by the adoption of the Romani Decree, the

Respondent asserts that the Third Energy Account already provided that the objective

of cumulative nominal power from solar energy in Italy by 2020 was 8,000 MW.*°

By the end of 2010, that objective ‘was almost half reached, thus forcing the
government to reduce the incentives provided by the Third Energy Account during
2011.’787 In the Respondent’s view, it was plausible to imagine that the expectation
that the Third Energy Account would extend until 2013 ‘should be balanced with the
need to meet that objective.’*** The Romani Decree was ‘merely a way to respect the

Italian energy objective’ and the new EU Directive.?*

The Respondent also argues that the alleged uncertainty created by the Romani Decree
would have lasted less than 50 days, because on 19 April 2011 the Government

indicated the salient aspects of the Fourth Energy Account.?””

The Respondent further contends that the restriction regarding the percentage of
agricultural land that could be used for solar plants ‘connects with the essential ratio,
required by EU legislation, to reconcile the development of renewable energy with the
protection of the environment, territory and landscape, and is combined with the need
to gradually reduce the expansive investment trend in photovoltaic, in order to meet
the quantitative targets envisaged under the EU scheme.’”*”! As a result, Italy argues
that the change was expectable and ‘cannot be classified as a bearer of instability.’*?”
Moreover, the Respondent argues that the Romani Decree foresaw a one-year
transitional period to complete the plants for which the relevant authorisations were

already in force, such as the Claimants’ DIAs.?°>

180. With respect to the adoption of the Fourth Energy Account, the Respondent’s argument

can be summarized as follows:

(a)

(b)

(c

(d

(e)

The register created by the Fourth Energy Account actually added an essential
294

element of certainty, as acknowledged by the Claimants.
The correction of the lists was not based on a redefinition of the regulatory
framework but rather on a correction of material errors, which could not be seen
as a situation that could discourage investors with respect to a project solidly

founded and developed.9>

The period of alleged uncertainty would have been limited to 10 days, as the list

was corrected on 29 April 2011.7°

The list published on 15 July 2011 also included almost all the Claimants’
projected plants.?°7

More generally, it is unclear why the national and regional regulations worked
well for the more than 1,400 plants which were built in the years 2010/2011, while

it created unbearable uncertainty for the Claimants.?°*

The Claimants failed to provide concrete evidence that the alleged regulatory
uncertainty effectively deterred third-party investors from participating in the
initiative, and its arguments are based primarily on the direct testimony of the two
Claimants, who the Respondent submits ‘are clearly unsuitable to prove the

existence of the alleged facts.’?°?

1. The Respondent further contends that the explanation of the failure of the Claimants’
Project falls in the category of business risk, as it is the result of the Claimants’ decision
to try to prepare a mega project on paper in order to attract third-party investors instead

of deciding to gradually build the plants.°°

Nv

With respect to the stop-work order, the Respondent notes that the Claimants failed to
mention that on 13 January 2012, i.e. two days after the issuance of the stop-work
order by the municipality of Brindisi, the Regional Administrative Tribunal suspended

301

its effects.*”' The Respondent contends that these two days appear to be ‘completely

irrelevant to the conclusion of the work by the deadline of 29 February 2012.75

(ii) | The FET standard and legitimate expectations

BD

The Respondent contends that the protection of legitimate expectations ‘shall be
connected with the general principles of good faith and fairness.’*° It also argues that
‘the assessment of the legitimacy of the expectations is inseparably linked to an
assessment of the legitimacy of the State conduct, and in particular to the pursuit of

the public interest in the exercise of sovereign prerogatives.’*°*

184. According to the Respondent, the expectations alleged by the Claimants have no

300

legitimacy under international law ‘for the simple reason that they are based on the
claim, completely unreasonable, that the State cannot evolve its own legislation

according to plausible and verifiable objectives of public interest and in accordance

with the fundamental principles of due process, proportionality and non-

discrimination.
The Respondent notes that, unlike situations observed in other investment disputes,
the decision of the Constitutional Court, the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy
Account are ‘forms of exercise of regulatory power in general terms.’*° The
Respondent also highlights that, unlike other cases, here the Respondent did not make
any promises directed to the Claimants concerning the evolution of its legislation on
photovoltaic plants. As a result, the alleged expectations are based solely on the

general regulation provided by the Italian State.*°”

The Respondent argues that it would be necessary for the Claimants ‘to demonstrate
the profound irrationality of the evolution of this regulation in the years 2010-2012."
However, in its view, the decision of the Constitutional Court, the Romani Decree and
the Fourth Energy Account were reasonable. The Respondent notes, in particular, the
objectives that had been fixed in the Third Energy Account (which would explain the
adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account), and the transitional

scheme foreseen in the Fourth Energy Account.>?

The Respondent further argues that the stop-work order could not have infringed the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations because the ‘timely intervention’ of the Regional

Administrative Court makes the alleged injury to the expectations non-existent.>!°

2. The alleged breach of Article 13 of the ECT

188. The Respondent argues that, to constitute expropriation, the measures shall
substantially deprive the investor of the use and enjoyment of the investment. It asserts
that, as a result, ‘it is necessary that there is an appropriate causal link between

interference from State measures and deprivation of the benefits of the investment.’3!!

189, The Respondent contends that there is no evidence of the causal link required to

312

establish the existence of indirect expropriation,*!* and therefore the existence of

expropriation is excluded.>>

190. The Respondent further argues that, even if there were evidence of a causal link
between the measures and the failure of the fate of the Claimants’ Project, the measures
adopted by the Italian Government would fall in the category of non-compensable
‘regulatory takings’,*!* because the measures were adopted in a non-discriminatory

manner and aimed at regulating a matter of public interest.3!°

VII. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES ON QUANTUM

A. The Claimants’ position

191. The Claimants assert that the damages due as a result of Italy’s breach of Articles 10(1)
and 13 of the ECT must be determined according to customary international law.
Relying on the ICJ’s Judgment in the Chorzéw Factory case and on Article 36 of the
Draft Articles on State Responsibility, the Claimants argue that reparation must be
sufficient to eliminate the consequences of the wrongful acts committed by the State.*!

In their view, compensation is generally assessed by reference to capital value, loss of

profit and incidental expenses.*!” The Claimants also contend that ‘it is ... accepted

that the risk of wrongful acts by the State must be excluded in assessing damages

caused by such wrongful acts.’*!*

192. The Claimants quantified damages using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis,
which they claim is ‘in line with arbitral case law.’*!* They offer three alternative

valuations based on three different valuation dates:

(a) €187.8 million taking March 2010 as the valuation date, if the Tribunal considers
that the Constitutional Court’s decision violated the ECT;>°

(b) €229.5 million taking January 201 1 as the valuation date, if the Tribunal considers
that the Constitutional Court’s decision did not violate the ECT but all the other

321

measures did;**! and

(c) €133.5 million taking May 2011 as the valuation date, if the Tribunal considers
that only the series of administrative errors and the direct interference by the local
authority breached the ECT.*”

(a) the electricity generation estimate used by Capital Systeme, assuming the entry
into operation of 120 MW for the two first valuations, and 113 MW for the May
2011 valuation, given the list published by the GSE in September 2011;°7

incorporate the same mistrust as reflected in the Italian Government bond yields.’*””

the Tribunal does not accept the DCF analysis.**” The Claimants estimate their capital

contributions to the Project at €35.5 million.3*3

The Claimants reject the adjustments to Mr. Lapuerta’s DCF analysis proposed by the
Respondent (described below). They argue that they are intended to reflect events that
occurred after Italy’s breaches of the ECT. This, in their view, defeats the purpose of
the DCF analysis.***

Finally, as to comparative negligence, the Claimants accept that to the extent that the
failure of the Project was due conjointly (in whatever proportions) to the fault of the
Claimants and the failure of the investors to proceed with the Project, damages should

be reduced accordingly.**°

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent rejects the application of the DCF method in the instant case on the
basis that the 120 MW Project was never a going concern.**° The Respondent notes,
among other things, that ‘several months after the date of May 2011, no construction
activity of photovoltaic plants had been made at any of the 120 lots’,>*” and that the

Project was ‘still on paper.’***

The Respondent also contends that the application of the DCF method would result in

‘unjustified enrichment.’** It highlights that, in the present case, the vast majority of

the capital needed was not yet invested and there is no evidence of a contractual or

quasi-contractual relationship with one or more potential investors.“

Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the Articles on State Responsibility require
the State’s illegal conduct to be not too remotely linked to the damage allegedly
caused.*#! The Respondent claims that the application of the DCF method in the
present case would contradict this requirement. It argues that ‘the damage that would
be considered refundable is in fact largely constructed on events being completely
remote with respect to the Italian conduct in question, and clearly uncertain with regard

to their occurrence.’*4?

The Respondent finally alleges that the Tribunal should take into account the
Claimants’ contributory fault in assessing the alleged damages. In particular, the
Respondent highlights: (i) the Claimants’ decision to implement a 120 MW unified
project instead of developing it gradually; (ii) the Claimants’ disregard of the 8,000
MW cap established by the Third Energy Account; (iii) the failure by the Claimants to
acquire guarantees from lenders before embarking on the business project; and (iv) the

Claimants’ overvaluation of the purchased land.***

Regarding the assumptions considered in the Claimants’ DCF analysis, the

Respondent contends as follows:

(a) the minimum guaranteed price of electricity (MGP) considered by Mr. Lapuerta
(which assumes a constant growth of 0.7% per year) is incorrect, because the

MGP constantly decreased since May 2011;54*

Mr. Lapuerta considered a council tax of 5,000 €/MW, while a realistic

assumption is to consider a tax of 15,000 €/MW;*4*

the accounting depreciation period for PV plants in Italy is 25 years — not 15 years

as assumed by Mr. Lapuerta;*"°

it is inappropriate to use the German Government bonds yield in order to calculate
the discount rate. The Respondent explains that the cost of equity represents the
opportunity cost, in terms of perceived risk, of investing capital in a specific
business. It is unfounded to use German bond yields to evaluate the equity cash

flows of a project like a PV installation in Italy;**” and

Mr. Lapuerta failed to consider the new regulations adjusting incentive tariffs

pursuant to Decree 91 of 2014 (the so-called ‘spalma incentivi’).***

Taking into account these corrections, the Respondent contends that the damages

valuation based on a DCF analysis should range between €19.4 million and €32.7

million, depending on which of the three options under the ‘spalma incentivi’

regulation is considered, and €40.4 million if the ‘spalma incentivi’ regulation is not

taken into account.*””

The Respondent also challenges the Claimants’ calculation of reliance damages. It

contends that the Claimants failed to consider the liquidation value of the land, and

that reliance damages should be assessed on the basis of the €13.84 million effectively

invested as of May 2011 (i.e., the latter of the dates considered by the Claimants for

VU. THE EC’S AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF AND THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
ON INTER SE APPLICATION OF THE ECT

A. The European Commission’s Amicus Brief

206. The circumstances in which the Tribunal accepted a late-filed EC request to make a
non-disputing party submission have already been described (see paragraphs 15 to 31
above). Given that the Respondent effectively endorsed the EC’s request and
arguments, the Claimants’ otherwise well-founded plea that ICSID Rule 37(2) is
expressly limited to the filing by a non-disputing party of ‘a written submission ...
regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute’ was rendered effectively moot.
Furthermore, the Tribunal has an obligation ex officio to ascertain its jurisdiction.*°

The position of the EC and the Parties is set out here and subsequently analysed (see

below, paragraphs 211-260 and 277-309).

207. The EC asserts that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under the ECT because

Member States have only created obligations regarding investment promotion and

protection with respect to third countries.>°

According to the EC, investors
incorporated in a Member State or citizens of a Member State are unable to bring an

investment claim against a Member State under Article 26 of the ECT.*%*

35! Counter-Memorial, para, 552; Expert Report of Luca Benedetti, 27 October 2015, p. 5.
880 In Procedural Order No, 3, the Tribunal noted that:

[Pursuant to Rule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal “may on its own initiative
consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute ... is within the jurisdiction of the
Centre and within its own competence.” Without making at this stage any determinations as to
the weight that it may give to the arguments raised in the Commission's Submission, the
Tribunal considers that the character of the arguments advanced in the Submission justifies
accepting it into the record.

211.

According to the EC, an EU investor’s investment in another Member State is
governed and protected by EU law.*** Article 3(2) of the TFEU prevents Member
States from concluding bilateral or multilateral investment agreements that would

affect or alter EU law.**°

The EC contends that the Member States did not retain the competence to enter into
inter se obligations with respect to investment protection at the time they ratified the
ECT.**” In consequence the relevant Italian court is the appropriate forum for bringing

a claim against Italy.*°*

. The EC refers to the decision in Electrabel, which in its view is distinguishable from

the present case in that Hungary was not a Member State of the European Communities
when it ratified the ECT.*° The pivotal issue in that case was whether Hungary’s
accession to the EU extinguished its international obligations under the ECT or
whether they were superseded through Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30 of the
VCLT2 In the present case, the EC submits that there never were inter se
international obligations between the Member States ab initio*°! The EC also

endorses the relevant legal findings of the tribunal in Electrabel.>°
1. The legal order of the EU and investment protection under EU law

a. The constitutional order of the EU

According to the EC, the EU has been established based on the Treaty of the European

Union (‘TEU’) and the TFEU, thereby creating a legal order with its own institutions

in exchange for which Member States narrowed their sovereign rights.°° In the EC’s
view, the European Court and Member States’ domestic courts guard the legal order
of the EU, which is implemented through the preliminary ruling mechanism
established under Article 267 of the TFEU.** Furthermore, the BC argues that
Member States are bound to ensure compliance with EU law, which also provides

remedies for ensuring its application.*°

b. The competences of the EU and its Member States

The EC asserts that competences within the EU are governed by the principle of
conferral whereby the EU will act within the limits afforded by the Member States.*°
According to the EC, competences are divided between external and internal” The
latter enables the EC to legislate and adopt binding rules when it has been granted
exclusive internal competence, including within the scope of common commercial
policy.** In the EC’s view, the Treaty of Lisbon extended the scope of commercial

policy into the area of foreign direct investment.*°?

According to the EC, it has external competence to conclude international agreements
on areas of internal competence, such as investment promotion and protection.5”°
Member States are therefore prevented from entering into international commitments
outside the framework of the EU, or from concluding any international agreement that

might affect common rules or impact their scope.>”! Furthermore, Member States

a

cannot invoke international agreements as a reason for failing to comply with EU

law. 372

c The internal market rules

The EC explains that it is created around an internal market that represents an area
without boundaries and allows the free movement of goods, persons, services and
1373

capital Provisions on free movement prevent the adoption of discriminatory

measures, non-discriminatory restrictions and expropriation by Member States.*”*

The EC explains that restrictions on these freedoms may be justified on the grounds
described in Articles 52 and 65 of the TFEU, or by ‘overriding requirements in the
general interest.’*”> In the view of the EC, justifications must be interpreted based on
the general principles of EU law, especially as enunciated in the Charter of

Fundamental Rights.°”°

. According to the EC, the protection granted by the freedom of establishment and

capital, including the general principles of EU law, extend throughout the lifetime of
the investment.*”” These protections are complemented by provisions on the internal

market and measures adopted by the EU’s legislature.*”*
d. Member States’ ability to agree on investment protection rules
outside of the EU’s legal order

The EC contends that EU law did not, even in 1994, permit Member States to agree
on investment protection rules between themselves outside of the EU’s legal order for

the following reasons.

218. First, the EC argues that international commitments on investment protection between
Member States might conflict with the scope of the EU’s common rules as enunciated

from time to time.*”?

219. Second, the EC considers that the ISDS mechanism is inconsistent with the
relationship between Member States because the EU does not permit the settlement of

intra-EU disputes outside the framework of the EU.**°

2. The lack of inter se obligations under the ECT between Member
States
220. According to the EC, the ECT must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 and
32 of the VCLT, which confirm that the European Communities and its Member States
have not created obligations among themselves when entering into the ECT.*! On
this view, the ECT is a multilateral agreement concluded with third States.>*? It is part
of EU law, and the ECJ is competent to determine whether it has direct effect.**
Additionally, the EC can bring enforcement proceedings against Member States for

failure to comply with their obligations under the ECT.***

221.

According to the EC, the historical process confirms that the purpose of the ECT was
to establish an international framework to cooperate in the energy sector between the
European Communities and Eastern Europe, including Russia and the CIS.**
Furthermore, the ECT was already considered part of the European Communities’
external energy policy, as the internal energy market was already under

development.>**

226.

In the EC’s view, Member States became Contracting Parties of the ECT because they
retained competence over certain matters, but this arrangement did not create
obligations between Member States.**” The EC rejects Christian Tietje’s position that
obligations between Member States in the foregoing context ‘are the rule’ and that an
exception is only applicable when a multilateral agreement contains a disconnection

clause.***

According to the EC, the statement submitted by the European Communities to the
ECT Secretariat under Article 26(3)(ii) also confirms that the ECT does not create
obligations between Member States.** The tribunal in Electrabel confirmed this

understanding.”

3. The limited scope of inter se obligations between Member States
The EC submits that even if the ECT created mutual obligations between Member
States, they would only extend to areas in which Member States possess external

competence.*?!

Specifically, the EC considers that Member States are bound by the concept ‘liability
follows competence’ pursuant to Article 64 of the Draft articles on the responsibility
of international organizations and the relevant case law, when assessing their

international liability.*°?

According to the EC, the ECT also recognises in several instances a division of

external competence between the EU and its Member States.*°? In each instance, one

must determine whether the competence lies with the Member States or the EU.2°* The
EC clarified this division of competence through a note submitted to the ECT

Secretariat pursuant to Article 26(3)(ii) of the BCT.2>

227. The EC submits that all provisions within Part III of the ECT fall within the
competence of the EU and thus they are binding on the EU*** and that, as a result, in
the event of a dispute between the EU and an investor from a third country, the EU

397

will be internationally responsible for any breach.*”’ The EC contends that because

the ECT provisions on investment protection only bind the EU, and not the Member
States inter se, an EU investor cannot bring a claim against a Member State.°?*
According to the EC, such a claim would not represent a dispute against another

Contracting Party for the purposes of Article 26 of the ECT.*?

228. Moreover, the EC argues, if the ECT terms are considered ambiguous regarding the
mutual obligations between Member States, then the Tribunal should adopt an
interpretation that would be consistent with EU law.‘ According to the EC, the
proper interpretation is that the ECT is inapplicable between Member States, or at least

Article 26 of the ECT does not apply between them.*°!

4. Application of Chapter III and Article 26 ECT under VCLT Article
30

229. The EC submits that, for purposes of Article 30 of the VCLT, the ECT and the EU
Treaties relate to the same subject matter, namely energy.*? Accordingly, while the

ECT is an earlier treaty compared to the EU Treaties, the ECT only applies to the

extent that its provisions are not incompatible with the EU treaties.“°? On that basis,
the EC argues that the Tribunal should conclude that Chapter III and Article 26 of the
ECT are not applicable between Member States pursuant to Article 30 of the VCLT.*%*

The Respondent's position

. The Respondent endorses, in principle, the conclusions presented by the EC in its

amicus curiae brief.*°°

. According to the Respondent, it did not raise jurisdictional objections based on non-

applicability of the ECT between EU investors and EU Member States because it
considers that no investment has been concluded under the ECT,‘ or that, even if an
investment is found to exist, it was established contrary to law and the principle of
good faith.“”” The Respondent argues that if the Tribunal considers the investment as
legitimate, then it would share the EC’s conclusion that the ECT is inapplicable within
the EU.*°8 The Respondent asserts that it was, in part, due to its awareness of the EU’s

approach that it denounced the ECT in December 2014.4”

In the Respondent’s view, the main issues in this case are to determine the ECT
obligations that are imposed upon it as an EU Member State, the allocation of
competences in light of EU treaties and the effects on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction‘!

The Respondent argues that this approach was followed in the Electrabel case.4'!

The Respondent submits that the Electrabel case is relevant as it provides an
understanding of EU law in connection with the ECT and for understanding

subsequent disputes.*!”

Specifically, the Respondent argues that EU treaties, as
international law, must be interpreted subject to the VCLT.“'3 According to the
Respondent, EU law being international law, it must also be taken into account by the
Tribunal pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT and Article 42(1) of the ICSID
Convention.*'* In sum, the Respondent asserts that the jurisdictional issues arising
under EU law and raised by the EC fall within the scope of the dispute because EU

law impacts the interpretation of the ECT.‘

The Respondent also observes that the Claimants based their Request on their French,
German and Belgian nationalities without invoking the Swiss permanent residency
acquired by two of the Claimants in 2009 (Lecorcier) and 2011 (Stein).“!° In addition,
the Respondent argues that the Claimants must satisfy the definition of ‘Investor’
under both the ECT and the ICSID Convention, which does not contemplate the
possibility for a permanent resident to be treated as a ‘national.’*!” Even if permanent
residents were considered ‘investors’ under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention
(which the Respondent denies), the Respondent argues that at the time of its consent
to the ECT (ie. the date of signature), the two Claimants did not benefit from their
status of Swiss permanent residents and therefore would not qualify as a protected

‘Investor’ under the ICSID Convention.*'®

1. Interpretation of the ECT under International Law

In the Respondent’s view, the main issue in this case is the extent to which the EU and
its Member States intended to become bound inter se by the ECT when they entered

into that multilateral treaty.!”

The Respondent observes that the definition of ‘Contracting Party’ in the ECT
‘include[s] EU Member States, on the one side, and the EU as a regional economic
integration organization, on the other.’*”° It also notes that the definition of ‘regional
economic integration organization’ shows that EU Member States had transferred a
number of competences to the EU with respect to which the EU has regulatory power

in the whole territory.*?!

In the Respondent’s view, the allocation of competences
within the EU cannot rely on geographical boundaries but rather on competence by
subject matter. This would be confirmed by the recognition of overlapping territories

in the definition of ‘Area’ in Article 1(10).*??

. The Respondent adds that Article 25 of the ECT seems to specifically recognize that

rules of an Economic Integration Agreement prevail and are recognized by the ECT.*7>

According to the Respondent, the declarations and understandings of the Contracting
Parties to the ECT also confirm that the ECT does not apply between EU Member
States.**4 Specifically, the Respondent contends that Annex 2 to the Final Act of the
ECT Conference** shows that the Contracting Parties to the ECT ‘had clear in mind

the issue of treatment of investors from a country that was a Contracting Party to the

EIA or a member of a free-trade are or customs union, shall be entitled to treatment accorded under such EIA,

ECT but not a member of the EU.’“?° In the Respondent’s view, in order to avoid
double protection, an EU investor would not have the right to invoke Article 26 of the
ECT for protecting itself, and it would rather need to invoke EU law and seek a method

of redress within that context.4?7

oS

The Respondent also highlights the purpose of the ECT and circumstances surrounding
its adoption. It asserts that the historical context underlying the treaty illustrates that
it was intended to integrate the energy sectors between the EU and Eastern European
States, including Russia, and not to regulate the EU internal energy market which at

that time was already under way under its own regulatory system.‘7°

0. The Respondent submits that EU Member States and the EU have consistently
followed this approach regarding intra-EU jurisdictional issues.*”? According to the
Respondent, since the Electrabel case, the EU and its Member States’ judicial practice

proves that the ECT was not intended to cover intra-EU relations or situations.**°

In the Respondent’s view, the Electrabel case is relevant for current purposes because
it restricts the scope of Article 26 of the ECT to extra-EU disputes, whereas internal
disputes must be addressed by the Member States’ domestic courts and the ECJ.*%!
The Respondent notes, however, that the Electrabel case is different because it did not

focus on whether the ECT would be applicable in that dispute.**”

In this case, the
Respondent contends that the focus lies on the intent of the Member States when

entering into the ECT in light of their obligations under EU treaties.**

According to the Respondent, the absence of a disconnection clause is not decisive as
to the issue of inter se application. The Member States did enter into inter se

434

agreements and their presence cannot be disregarded.*** The Respondent asserts that

‘the ECT contains Article 16, which is a conflict rule that in fact establishes priorities

for both prior and subsequent inter se agreements.’**°

Based on the foregoing, the Respondent contends that the ECT did not apply ab initio
to intra-EU situations, as this was not the intention of the Contracting Parties. As a

result, Article 26 of the ECT confers no jurisdiction over this dispute.**°

2. The evolution of EU treaties and their impact on the ECT

Alternatively, the Respondent asserts that the present state of the law, especially in
light of the Lisbon Treaty, shows that intra-EU disputes are not now included within
the scope of the ECT.*%”

. In the Respondent’s view, the main issue ~ assuming for the sake of argument that the

ECT initially had inter se effect —is whether the Lisbon Treaty subsequently concluded
among some of the ECT’s Contracting Parties is consistent with the ECT itself.47* The
Respondent argues that this issue must be assessed in light of Articles 30 and 41 of the
VCLT.4?

. According to the Respondent, the attribution of competences to the EU is governed by

the principle of conferral: the EU acts within the competences that have been granted
to it by Member States.” The Respondent submits that common commercial policy

falls within the EU’s exclusive competence, whereas energy remains a shared

competence. **!

The Respondent argues that while the EU’s competences have
evolved, Member States retain a duty to cooperate with the EU and are bound to avoid

harming the ‘effet utile’ of EU law.”

In the Respondent’s view, since the Lisbon Treaty and the ECT involve the same
subject matter, Article 30 of the VCLT applies to their interplay.4* The Respondent
also contends that the ECT must derogate from any provision or dispute resolution
mechanism of another agreement that is more favourable to the investor or investment,
in accordance with Article 16 of the ECT.“ The Respondent argues that EU law
guarantees better protection to an investor or an investment than the ECT,“*> and
therefore the coverage of intra-EU situations regarding FDI by EU law is compatible
with the ECT by virtue of Article 16 of the ECT.“

According to the Respondent, regardless of Article 16 of the ECT, one would reach
the same conclusion by applying Article 30(4) of the VCLT.“*”

Lastly, the Respondent alleges that Article 41(1)(a) of the VCLT allows parties to an
agreement to enter into another treaty which modifies the initial agreement among
themselves.“* According to the Respondent, the Lisbon Treaty respects the spirit of
the VCLT because it did not impact the rights of other Contracting Parties or the

performance of their obligations under the ECT.” Instead, the Respondent contends

that the Lisbon Treaty simply increases economic integration, which favours the

execution of the ECT.4°°

The Claimants’ position

. In the first place, the Claimants maintain their objection to the admissibility of the

EC’s brief for three reasons. First, the Claimants contend that the issues raised by the
EC do not fall within the scope of the dispute because the Respondent did not raise
it,*! and that those issues cannot be considered at the Tribunal’s own initiative under

ICSID Rule 41(2) because it was untimely.***

. Second, the Claimants submit that even if the EC’s objection were well-founded, it

would have no bearing on the Tribunal’s ability to hear the claims under Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention.*** It is true that jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is
established in this case through the respective nationality of each Claimant.*** But that
nationality (which is not in dispute) simply qualifies them to access ICSID arbitration.
Consent to arbitration derives from the ECT, and exists regardless of the EC’s position
on inter se application of the ECT because two of the Claimants are Swiss permanent

residents and Switzerland is not an EU Member State.***

Third, the Claimants argue that the Respondent is misguided when it claims that two
of the Claimants were not Swiss permanent residents when Italy consented to

arbitration under the ECT.**° In the Claimants’ view, the date of consent is when they

accepted Italy’s offer to arbitrate, at the time the Request was filed.“” At that time,

both Messrs. Stein and Lecorcier were Swiss permanent residents.

Turning to the merits of the EC’s position, the Claimants reject it for two reasons.
There is no basis to claim that EU Member States lacked competence, in 1994 or now,
to enter into inter se obligations with respect to investment protection by EU
investors.* EU Member States have full capacity to commit themselves to treaty
obligations.*° Second, the Claimants contend that the EU and its Member States are
Contracting Parties of the BCT.“ The main issue is the scope of ECT obligations
assumed by the Contracting Parties, which can be determined by applying Articles 31
and 32 of the VCLT.“"! Applying those provisions there is no ground for denying inter
se application of the ECT.

1. The ECT creates inter se obligations among all Contracting Parties

The Claimants contend that the Member States’ lack of competence for entering into
inter se obligations regarding investment protection under the ECT is inconsistent with

462

the principles of sovereignty and pacta sunt servanda.*? The question is not their

competence to act but whether it was exercised in the given case.

Thus whether Member States entered into inter se obligations under the ECT is a
matter of treaty interpretation.*** While they agree that Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT
provide the rules of interpretation, the Claimants note that the Commission has not
conducted a textual analysis of the ECT.‘ In their view, Article 26 confirms that the

ECT applies to disputes between any Contracting Party and an Investor of any other

Contracting Party.“°°

Moreover, Part III on its face entails obligations vis-a-vis each
Contracting State’s investors or investments without drawing any distinction between

EU Member States and other Contracting States.*°

The Claimants assert that the ECT’s preparatory works and the circumstances of its
conclusion do not constitute ‘context’ pursuant to the VCLT.“*” In the Claimants’
view, Articles 24 and 25 of the ECT are the relevant ‘context’ for the interpretation of
Article 26 of the ECT, and they do not support the EC’s interpretation.4%* Recourse to
the travaux préparatoires is inadmissible when interpretation pursuant to Article 31
VCLT results in a clear and reasonable meaning. But in any event, the travaux
préparatoires confirm the interpretation based on the ordinary meaning of the text.“
The EC had suggested including a ‘disconnection clause’ within the ECT, but the other

negotiating States rejected that proposal.4”°

2. Transfer of competence does not protect EU Member States from
responsibility under the ECT
In the Claimants’ view, the EC does not interpret the ECT pursuant to the VCLT but
based on EU law.*”! But under public international law, EU Member States may not

derogate from their ECT obligations on the basis of their membership in the EU.4”

The Claimants also submit that the EC has not established that Member States lack

473

competence over investment protection and energy.*”* In the Claimants’ view, the EU

does not enjoy exclusive competence in those areas, which are shared competences in

the internal market.4”* According to the Claimants, the Lisbon Treaty’s competence
over foreign direct investment is only an external competence, which does not affect
EU Member States’ inter se relations.”> The Lisbon Treaty has not repealed the ECT,

which remains in effect between EU Member States.‘

259. According to the Claimants, arbitral tribunals have regularly rejected the so-called
‘intra-EU’ jurisdictional objection that has been raised by the EC.*”” No fewer than
eleven arbitral tribunals have addressed this argument and it has never been

successful.47*

3. The inapplicability of the ex posterior principle

260. The Claimants submit that the EC and the Respondent wrongly contend that Part [II
and Article 26 of the ECT are inapplicable between Member States pursuant to Article

30 of the VCLT.*” The Claimants’ arguments can be summarized as follows:

(a) The EC has not demonstrated that the ECT’s investment protections under

Chapter II and Article 26 are incompatible with EU law.**°

(b

Article 30 of the VCLT is not applicable because the ECT and the TFEU do not

address the same subject matter.“*! In the Claimants’ view, the substantive

protections under the ECT and EU law are different as the ECT provides rights
and protection that are more extensive than what is offered in the EU’s internal

market. *?

The ECT should also supersede EU law on the basis of Article 30 of the VCLT

IX. ISSUES OF JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY: THE TRIBUNAL’S
CONCLUSIONS

A. Issues originally raised by the Respondent

261. The Tribunal will first consider the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility raised by

the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial and maintained in the Rejoinder.

1. The Claimants’ Investment

262. As noted (paragraph 125 above), the Respondent denies that the Claimants have a
protected investment, whether under the ECT or the ICSID Convention. It stresses
that the Claimants ‘never placed themselves in the actual condition of collaborating
with the Italian development plan of photovoltaic energy through the construction

(even gradual) of plants that could benefit from incentive plans, but they simply

264.

constituted the pre-conditions for the realization of an ambitious project that would

produce that effect.’#88

Turning first to the ECT, Article 1(6) contains a typically broad definition of
‘investment’ and states that it applies ‘to any investment associated with an Economic
Activity in the Energy Sector.’ Article 1(5) of the ECT defines ‘Economic Activity in
the Energy Sector’ as ‘an economic activity concerning the exploration, extraction,
refining, production, storage, land transport, transmission, distribution, trade,
marketing, or sale of Energy Materials and Products except those included in Annex
NI, or concerning the distribution of heat to multiple premises.’ An attached
understanding lists as ‘illustrative of Economic Activity in the Energy Sector’ ‘(ii)
construction and operation of power generation facilities, including those powered by
wind and other renewable energy sources.’ In the Tribunal’s view, the words
‘construction and operation’ do not impose a cumulative requirement; if they did, an
investor purchasing an already constructed plant would not be covered. Whatever the
position with merely preparatory work, e.g. in the preparation of a tender or the

negotiation of a concession,**”

once an active process of construction of an energy
project involving substantial resources is commenced, the merely preparatory phase is
over and the project qualifies as an investment. There is no doubt that, assuming the
Claimants’ Project was lawful and not merely speculative, it fell squarely within the

terms of Article 1(5) and (6) of the ECT.

As to the lawfulness of the Project, it is true that the ECT does not lay down an explicit
requirement of legality, but the Tribunal concludes that it does not cover investments
which are actually unlawful under the law of the host state at the time they were made
because protection of such investments would be contrary to the international public

order. This conclusion is consistent with numerous other decisions and awards.*°° In

888 Rejoinder, para. 38.

#8 Cf. Mihaly v. Sri Lanka, Exhibit RL-15

°° See e.g. Yukos v. Russia, Exhibit CL-22, para. 1352: ‘An investor who has obtained an investment in the
host State only by acting in bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state ... should not be allowed to
benefit from the Treaty.” See also Plama v. Bulgaria, Exhibit CL-20, paras. 138, 140 and 143; World Duty

87

265.

particular, the Plama tribunal found that because: ‘... the ECT should be interpreted
in a manner consistent with the aim of encouraging respect for the rule of law ... the
substantive protections of the ECT cannot apply to investments that are made contrary
tolaw.’*?! On the other hand, the mere fact that the Claimants relied on the DIA system
of licensing individual plants (a licensing system already employed by the 12
development companies) did not render the Project actually unlawful from its
inception. It may or may not have eventually qualified for subsidies, a matter as to
which the Claimants took the risk. But they never, insofar as the record shows,
misrepresented their Project, and the Respondent, while complaining in general terms
of fraud and the like, produces no specific example of conduct by the Claimants which
was fraudulent or deceptive, unless it be the subsequent acquisition of multiple plots
individually authorised under the DIA procedure. Permits were duly obtained by the
12 development companies under the AU procedure for the sub-stations and the
connecting network, and following the acquisition of the companies, Eskosol obtained
recognition of the eligibility of almost all the proposed plants (113 of 120) under the
Fourth Energy Account (see above, paragraphs 110-112). On the only occasion the
Puglia Project was tested at law, before the Regional Administrative Court of Puglia,

it survived scrutiny (see above, paragraph 119).

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent cites a series of decisions of the Corte di Cassazione
which, it argues, confirm ‘the unlawfulness of obtaining DIAs for individual plants

belonging to the same project.’*”?

The Court upheld a criminal conviction for fraud, holding that...

(b) In Cassazione penale 4056 1/2014, the Court held that, given the overall size of the

plant, the applicant should have used the AU and not the DIA procedure, and that
the use of the latter was unlawful.**> Moreover, it was unlawful even though the
DIAs were obtained by the vendors who subsequently sold the land, with the
benefit of the DIAs, to a Spanish group which consolidated them and obtained the

relevant incentives.

(c) In Cassazione penale 16624/2015 (a case concerning wind power), the Court held

that: ‘the judges of the review excluded the validity of the simplified authorization
procedure followed in this case and highlighted the need of the single regional
authorization, prior environmental impact assessment, on the assumption that there
was a separation, only formal, among the individual turbines subject to seizure,
which constitute, in reality, a single plant. The Court essentially assumes that said
formal separation was made in order to keep each plant below the threshold of 60
kW of power, thus benefiting from the simplified authorization procedure and
deemed demonstrated the artificial circumvention of the sector rules ..."°° The

decision of the Court of Cagliari that the scheme was unlawful was upheld. These

(and other lower court decisions cited but not provided to the Tribunal*”’) raise

serious concerns about the legality of authorisation of the investment.

In their closing submissions, **

the Claimants relied principally on the decision of the
Regional Administrative Court of Puglia, which was the only Italian judicial decision
specifically concerning the Project and which was res judicata as far as the
Municipality was concerned. According to that decision, the Puglia Project did not
meet the criteria for a deemed single project under Regional Law 31/1998: the plots
had never been under single ownership; various persons applied for DIAs, not a single
entrepreneur, and there was no question of ‘several plots resulting from the fractioning
of an area of greater extent, carried out within the two years preceding the application’
(Regional Law 31/1998, Art. 3(1)(b)). In short, this was a case of amalgamation of

separate plots covered by DIAs, not fractionation of a single earlier plot.

The issue of the domestic legality of the Puglia Project is not an easy one. The
Regional Administrative Court’s decision concerned a stop-work order, and though it
favoured the Claimants and was not appealed, it is by no means clear that it would
have withstood subsequent legal action designed to query the provision or level of
incentives for this very large project. Nor is it clear that the distinction drawn by the
Regional Administrative Court between initial authorisation of plants and their
subsequent acquisition would have been maintained (see the later decisions of the
Corte di Cassazione, summarised in paragraph 265). Moreover, if the position of the
project companies was doubtful, it is not clear that Eskosol as purchaser from them

would have remained unaffected.

Neither Party called expert evidence on the point, in the absence of which the Tribunal
can only do its best with the Italian legal materials at its disposal. In the circumstances,
the Tribunal considers as crucial the repeated acts of approval by Italian agencies of

the Project, notably the authorisations by the AU procedure of the rings and the sub-

stations and the repeated listings of most of the proposed plants under the Fourth
Energy Account, which occurred without any deception or misrepresentation on the
part of the Claimants. In the end, the Respondent has not demonstrated the illegality
of the Project. But this does not mean that the Project was insulated from market
concerns as to its potential illegality - concerns such as those which affected the
Project following the Constitutional Court decision, and did so without any fault on
the part of the Respondent or any great uncertainty as to the legal position (see
paragraph 92). The Project may have been protected by the ECT, but as a matter of
fact it was not insulated from market uncertainties inherent in the risk of project design

and delayed implementation.

. As to Respondent’s claim that the Claimants had a merely paper project of a
speculative character,*?? even if this might have been initially true, it ceased to be true
once the Claimants invested substantially through their financing of the sub-stations
and the rings. Moreover, while there may be doubt as to the speculative character of
an investment at an early stage, once this doubt is resolved by substantial measures of
implementation, including assumption of financial risk, it should be presumed that the
investment was a genuine one, and was correspondingly treaty-protected, from the

outset 5°

. In this respect the Claimants point to a number of decisions, under the ECT and BITs,
where projects were held to be investments despite never producing nor even being

finally licensed to do so.*?!

. Given that the Project was covered as an investment under Article 1(6) of the ECT, it
needs little to show that it was equally covered by the ICSID Convention, which

contains no separate definition of ‘investment.’ Even if, as the Respondent argued,

one were to apply the Salini criteria as interpreted in subsequent decisions,” the

Claimants clearly had an investment for ICSID purposes.

2. ‘Clean hands’/Good faith

Claimants lacked ‘clean hands’ or were acting in bad faith in pursuing the Project.

a

. This issue has already been substantially treated under the rubric of the legality of the
Project. No evidence has been tendered that Eskosol was guilty of ‘deceiving the
Energy Services Operator on the actual size and nominal power of the photovoltaic
plant’, a key basis for the Court of Criminal Cassation decision of 5 February 2014;5°

and in the absence of any such evidence, the ‘clean hands’ doctrine has nothing to

operate on. It is therefore unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide whether there exists

a generic ‘clean hands’ defence or ground of inadmissibility in international

investment law.**

274. Under the ‘clean hands’ rubric, the Respondent also argues that the Project was not

27:

502

treaty-protected because of the Claimants’ failure to conduct an EIA:

as for the issue of the obligation of the EIA, the abusive conduct by the
Claimants appears contrary to the obligation of good faith not only because
it is inconsistent with the rationale of domestic law, but also because it is in
conflict ... with international law, and in particular with [Article 19 of] the
ECT...°°

outside its Area from all operations within the Energy Cycle in its Area...
Contracting Parties shall accordingly:

Gi promote the transparent assessment at an early stage and prior to

decision, and subsequent monitoring, of Environmental Impacts of

environmentally significant energy investment projects[.]
The Claimants object that claims based on Article 19, contained in Part IV of the ECT
(‘Miscellaneous Provisions’), are beyond the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction,
which is confined to Part III (‘Investment Promotion and Protection’). But the
Respondent does not make any affirmative claim or counterclaim based on Article 19,
and it is at least arguable that a tribunal constituted under Part III could take into
account conduct clearly in breach of other provisions of the ECT insofar as it is
relevant to the admissibility of a claim. The key point, however, is that Article 19
Operates not at the level of individual investors but at the interstate level, as is equally
the case with the developing general international law of EIAs.°° In so far as there is
any requirement for private parties to carry out an EIA for any proposed project, this
can only arise under the relevant national law. This is made clear by an Understanding

of the Contracting Parties appended to Article 19(1)(i):

It is for each Contracting Party to decide the extent to which the assessment
and monitoring of Environmental Impacts should be subject to legal
requirements, the authorities competent to take decisions in relation to such
requirements, and the appropriate procedures to be followed.
In accordance with Article 19(1)(i), it is for the law of the host state to determine the
existence and extent of EIA requirements binding on private parties, and it is not
enough to appeal to ‘the rationale of domestic law’ in the absence of specific legal

requirements.

Large solar plants are subject to a screening process as a result of which an EIA may

be imposed. No screening occurred (or seems to have been required) when the
project companies obtained approval for the individual plants which would make up
the Puglia Project.°? At most, there may have been some uncertainty as to the
applicability of the screening procedure given the ‘aggregative’ character of the
Project. But by the time Eskosol acquired the twelve development companies, the
time for an EIA was, by parity of reasoning from the 2012 decision of the Puglia
Court, past. At the level of the admissibility of claims, it is too late for Italy now to

assert that an ETA was ‘really’ required.
EU Law and the inter se issue
(a) Admissibility of the inter se argument

Claimants continue to protest®** that the Tribunal should not admit this argument,
introduced late by the EC in its request to file a non-disputing party submission, and
subsequently adopted by the Respondent (paragraphs 23-31 above). But as the
Tribunal has already ruled, it has an obligation to determine its jurisdiction, and the
rules of EU law relevant in the matter are part of the applicable law for this Tribunal.
The procedural barrier arising from the terms of ICSID Rule 37(2) has been effectively
overcome by the Respondent’s belated endorsement of the EC’s position, and any
additional costs imposed on the Claimants by this delay on the part of the Respondent
can be compensated for in the Tribunal’s final award on costs. Accordingly, the inter

se argument is admissible.

(b) The applicable law

. The Parties in effect agree that the applicable law in determining this issue is

international law, and specifically the relevant provisions of the VCLT. The Tribunal
agrees, but would observe that this does not exclude any relevant rule of EU law, which

S

The Tribunal evidently cannot exercise the special jurisdictional powers vested in the

European courts, but it can and where relevant should apply European law as such.
(c) The original scope of the ECT

As a matter of international law, the first question is whether the ECT applied to
relations inter se of EU Member States as at the date of its conclusion (December

1994) in accordance with Articles 31-33 of the VCLT.

On its face there is nothing in the text of the ECT that carves out or excludes issues

arising between EU Member States.

(1) The preamble to the ECT records that it intends ‘to place the commitments
contained in [the European Energy Charter] on a secure and binding international
legal basis.’ This implies that the scope of the (non-binding) European Energy
Charter of 17 December 1991 was replicated in binding form in the ECT. There is
no indication of any inter se exclusion in the Charter, which refers to a ‘new desire
for a European-wide and global co-operation based on mutual respect and
confidence’, and further refers to the ‘support from the European Community,
particularly through completion of its internal energy market’ (Preamble, paras. 6,
14), The EC and Euratom were signatories to the Charter. This was of course

before the Treaty of Maastricht, let alone the Lisbon Treaty.

(2) Article 1(2) of the ECT defines ‘Contracting Party’ as ‘a state or Regional
Economic Integration Organization which has consented to be bound by this Treaty
and for which the Treaty is in force.’*° EU Member States and the BU are all
Contracting Parties. Prima facie at least, a treaty applies equally between its
parties. It would take an express provision or very clear understanding between the
negotiating parties to achieve any other result. Thus when Great Britain was

asserting ‘the diplomatic unity of the British Empire’, it was argued from time to

 

5? Art, 1(3) defines ‘Regional Economic Integration Organization’ as ‘an organization constituted by states
to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty,
including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.’

time that multilateral treaties to which the Dominions were separately parties had
no inter se application. The inter se doctrine was not however accepted, being

unsupported by express provision or clear understanding to the contrary.>!°

(3) There is no express provision (or ‘disconnection clause’, to adopt recent parlance)
in the ECT"!

(4) While the Respondent and the EC relied on the travaux préparatoires to justify
reading in a disconnection clause, this is not permissible in a context in which the
terms of the treaty are clear.*!? In any case, the rravaux préparatoires seem to point
against implying a disconnection clause: one was proposed during the course of the

Energy Charter Treaty negotiations, but was rejected.>!?

Neither is there anything in the text to support the EC’s argument that the ECT did not
give rise to inter se obligations because the EU Member States were not competent to
enter into such obligations. The mere fact that the EU is party to the ECT does not
mean that the EU Member States did not have competence to enter into inter se
obligations in the Treaty. Instead, the ECT seems to contemplate that there would be
overlapping competences. The term ‘regional economic integration organization’ (or
REIO) is defined in Article 1(3) of the ECT to mean an ‘organization constituted by
states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of
which are governed by the ECT, including the authority to take decisions binding on
them in respect of those matters.’ The Area of the REIO is also defined by Article

1(10) with reference to EU law. But nothing in Article 1, nor any other provision in

the ECT, suggests that the EU Member States had then transferred exclusive

competence for all matters of investment and dispute resolution to the EU.

The EC argues that the ‘Member States ... are ... presumed to be aware of the rules
governing the distribution of competences in a supranational organisation they have

themselves created.’*!+

But if the Member States thought they did not have
competence over the inter se obligations in the ECT, this would have been made
explicit by including a declaration of competence to set out the internal division of
competence between the EC and its Member States, as has been done in many other

5

treaties with mixed membership.*!* Nothing in the text of the ECT supports the

implication of such a declaration of competence.

. Pursuant to Article 6 of the VCLT, every State possesses capacity to conclude treaties

and is bound by those obligations pursuant to the principle of pacta sunt servanda. No
limitation on the competence of the EU Member States was communicated at the time
that the ECT was signed. Article 46 of the VCLT provides that a State may not invoke
provisions of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties to invalidate a
treaty unless it was a manifest violation of a rule of fundamental importance. While
EU law operates on both an internal and international plane, a similar principle must
apply. Even if, as a matter of EC law, the EC has exclusive competence over matters
of internal investment, the fact is that Member States to the EU signed the ECT without
qualification or reservation. The inter se obligations in the ECT are not somehow
invalid or inapplicable because of an allocation of competence that the EC says can be
inferred from a set of EU laws and regulations dealing with investment. The more
likely explanation, consistent with the text of the ECT, is that, at the time the ECT was

signed, the competence was a shared one.

The EC relied on its competence argument to argue that there was also no diversity of

territory among the investors and the host State as required by Article 26, since both

Organisation, in accordance with Article II of the FAO Constitution.

are part of the same ‘Contracting Party’ for its purposes.°!

It is not necessary for the
Tribunal to deal with this argument, since it has held that the European Member States
remain ‘Contracting Parties’ and that the ECT does create infer se obligations for

European Member States.
(d) | Subsequent modification of the ECT as to infer se matters

The Respondent and the EC also argue that, even if the ECT had originally concerned
inter se matters, this was modified by the fact that the Member States of the EU
subsequently entered into other agreements that covered both the investment and
dispute resolution aspects of the ECT. The EC states that subsequent EU treaties, such
as the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Treaty of Nice, and the Treaty of Lisbon, implicitly
repealed the earlier ECT under the /ex posterior rule in Article 30 of the VCLT,
whereby ‘successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter’ will prevail over the

earlier to the extent that the treaties are not compatible.

Turning first to the substantive investment obligations, it is not clear how these are
incompatible with the investment rights protected under European law. The EC points
to the rules establishing the European internal market, with free movement of goods,
persons, services and capital. It states that discriminatory measures or expropriation
are not permitted under European law. But these obligations are arguably broader than
those in the ECT, and are complementary to them. There is no discrimination unless
the same benefits are not accorded to other EU States, but there is nothing in the ECT
that requires such a result. Were a national of a European State not party to the ECT
to bring international arbitration proceedings against a European host State that was a
party to the ECT and had breached investment obligations protected under it, that host
State would have to determine whether it could, consistent with its EU obligations,
decline to consent to such jurisdiction. Nothing in the ECT would prevent the host

State from extending its protections beyond those States that are party to it, if this were

289.

required to meet these obligations. As the tribunal found in Elecirabel v. Hungary,

EU law can be presumed not to conflict or otherwise be inconsistent with the ECT.*!”

The only example the EC pointed to where an inconsistency might arise between EU
and investment law was the award in Micula v. RomaniaS'® In Micula, however, the
tribunal concluded that EU law was not applicable to the dispute, as Romania had not
yet acceded to the EU at the time the impugned measures were taken (although the EC
appears to have taken the view that EU rules on state aid did apply during the accession
negotiations).>! Any conflict thus arose not out of incompatibility of the relevant BIT
with EU law, but out of a disagreement on whether EU rules applied prior to accession.
After the Micula award was issued, the EC notified Romania that it would be in breach
of the BU rules on state aid if it complied with its obligation under the award to pay
damages to the investors for a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.>2°
In that context, any conflict related to the implications of enforcement, not to direct
contradictions between the substantive rules themselves. This was also the conclusion

of both the Micula tribunal and the Micula ad hoc committee.

The Respondent and the EC also argue that the dispute resolution clause, Article 26 of
the ECT, is itself incompatible with Article 344 of the TFEU, which provides that
‘Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for

therein.”

In the view of the Tribunal, there is no such incompatibility. The dispute before this

Tribunal is not an inter-State dispute. It is a dispute, in the words of Article 26,

‘between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party.’ It is not
necessary for this Tribunal to decide whether Article 27, which concems inter-State
disputes, would be incompatible with Article 344 of the TFEU. Even if there were
such an inconsistency, this would not also void Article 26, since the later Treaty will
supersede the earlier one only to the extent of any incompatibility. To find otherwise
would disadvantage investors, who have no ability under European law to protect their
investment by suing the host State directly for breaches of the ECT. Neither does
anything in European law expressly preclude investor-State arbitration under the ECT

and the ICSID Convention.

As noted (paragraph 260(e) above), the Claimants also relied on the combined effect
of the lex specialis and lex posterior presumptions, the ECT being both more specific
than the EU legal order and subsequent to it. Having concluded that there is no
incompatibility between the TFEU and the ECT, the Tribunal does not need to address

this argument.

For these reasons, the Tribunal holds that the inter se obligations in the ECT have not

subsequently been modified or superseded by later European law.
(e) The state of the authorities

The intra-EU issue has been canvassed in greater or lesser depth by previous

investment tribunals, which have reached practically common conclusions.

The majority of these cases were brought under BITs signed before the respondent
State became part of the European Union. The main objection, raised in each case
either by the Respondent, or by the EC as intervenor, was that entry into the EU had
terminated or partially superseded the relevant BIT. Crucial to determining these
objections, whether made under Article 59 or 30 of the VCLT, was the compatibility
of the ECT with European Law. As set out in greater detail below, the tribunals in

question have consistently rejected these objections.

100

294. In Eastern Sugar B.V. v. Czech Republic, the tribunal held that:°7"

Free movement of capital and protection of the investment are different but
complementary things. If the EU Treaty gives more rights than it does the
BIT, then all EU parties, including the Netherlands and Dutch investors,
may claim those rights. If the BIT gives rights to the Netherlands and to
Dutch investors that it does not give other EU countries and investors, it
will be for those other countries and investors to claim their equal rights.
But the fact that these rights are unequal does not make them incompatible.

295. It stated that ‘the fact that the European Union does not provide for a possibility for an
investor to swe a host state directly, and that in international BIT arbitration this is an
essential feature of most bilateral investment treaties, is in itself sufficient to reject the
Czech Republic’s equivalence argument.’**

296. The tribunal in Rupert Binder v. Czech Republic reached the same result just a few
months later, holding that the BIT remained in force notwithstanding that the Czech

Republic was now part of the European Union.*”? It held that: °*4

Intra-EU investor-state arbitration is not inconsistent with the EC legal
order. Investor-state arbitration is not addressed by EC law, and the EC
legal order has not offered a substitute for investor-state arbitration.
... As there is no conflict between the Czech-German BIT and EC law, the
primacy of EU law is a moot point.

297. In Eureko v. Slovakia, the tribunal also held that there was no inconsistency between
EU law and the BIT. *° Rather, ‘the BIT establishes extensive legal rights and duties

that are neither duplicated in EU law nor incompatible with EU law.’*° The same

conclusion was reached in Micula v. Romania,>*’ in an award that was upheld on

annulment.**

~

In Electrabel v. Hungary, brought pursuant to the ECT,*”? the tribunal held that
European law and the ECT ‘are not in fact inconsistent or otherwise contradictory’,
but could be interpreted as being complementary.**’ While the tribunal went on to
consider what would happen if there were a material inconsistency, concluding that in
such a case EU law must prevail, this discussion was hypothetical.**! The tribunal did
not view European law as an obstacle to its jurisdiction. While the Respondent in this
case argues that the award restricts the scope of Article 26 of the ECT to extra-EU

disputes, there is nothing in Electrabel to support or require that conclusion.>”

9. The EC argues that it is not appropriate to draw analogies with Electrabel, since, like
the other authorities discussed above, the host State was not a member of the European
Union when it signed the relevant BIT. This contrasts to the present case, in which the
Respondent and the investors’ States were each part of the European Union at the time
of the signing of the ECT.**> But what is significant in Electrabel is that the tribunal
found that the ECT and European law were complementary; it is irrelevant to this
determination that Hungary was not part of the European Union at the time that the
ECT was signed, since the question was whether the ECT was partially superseded or
terminated subsequently by its entry into the EU. The same issue arises in the present

case in relation to Article 30 of the VCLT.

was party to the EU at the time that it signed the ECT, which was invoked as the basis

of jurisdiction.** The award became available only after most of the written pleadings
had been filed in this case, save for the Claimants’ Observations on the European
Commission’s Amicus Brief. However, at the Tribunal’s request, it was canvassed

thoroughly at the oral hearings.

In Charanne, the tribunal considered that the objections made by the EC and the
Respondent fell into three categories: (a) no diversity of territories between the
investor and the Respondent, since the investor’s State and the host State were both
part of the European Union; (b) an implicit disconnection clause could be read into the
ECT; and (c) that the dispute resolution mechanism in Article 26 is incompatible with
EU law. The tribunal rejected all three arguments. It held that neither the ECT itself,
nor the fact that the EU was a Member State, prevented an EU member State from
being sued by an investor of another Member State of the ECT.*** There was no lack
of diversity, since the investors were of a different nationality to the host State.°*°
Neither was it appropriate to imply a disconnection clause into the ECT. The text itself
was clear and provided no basis for doing so. Moreover, a distinction was to be made
between an inter-State dispute and an investor-State dispute. Even if Article 267 of
the TFEU meant that no intra-EU dispute could be resolved by an ad hoc arbitral
tribunal under Article 27 of the ECT, that did not preclude the jurisdiction of an
investor-State tribunal under Article 26 of the ECT.**’ Finally, the tribunal held that

538

there was no contradiction between ECT and EU law.>** It upheld its jurisdiction over

the dispute.

302. Despite the fact that the EC has intervened in many other intra-EU arbitrations, as far
as has been publicly reported, no tribunal yet has upheld this objection to

jurisdiction. >?

303.

a

Overall the effect of these decisions is a unanimous rejection of the intra-EU objection
to jurisdiction. The tribunal in each case has found that the relevant BIT or the ECT
was intended to bring about binding obligations between EU Member States. The
tribunals found no contradiction between the substantive provisions of EU law and the
substantive or dispute resolution provisions of the BITs. No such system for investor-
State arbitration exists in EU law, and it would be incorrect to characterise such
disputes as inter-State disputes such that Article 267 of the TFEU could be said to
preclude jurisdiction. These conclusions support those adopted by the Tribunal in this

case.
(f) Relevance of the individual Claimants’ Swiss permanent residence

304. In the alternative, the two individual Claimants argue that they have standing as
‘Investors’ under the ECT as Swiss permanent residents, even if Blusun as a Belgian
corporation does not. While the Tribunal has ruled that Blusun does have standing
under Article 26 of the ECT as an ‘investor’, it will nevertheless consider the
nationality of the other Claimants. The argument arises from the definition of

‘Investor’ in ECT Article I:

(7) ‘Investor’ means:

(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:

(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or

who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in

accordance with its applicable law; ...
Mr. Lecorcier, the majority shareholder in Blusun, became a Swiss permanent resident
in January 2009, thus before the events giving rise to the present claim. Mr. Stein,
holding the rest of the shares, only became a Swiss permanent resident in January
2011, at which stage most of those events had occurred and as such could not form the

basis of any claim by him.

In support of this argument the Claimants rely on the decision in Feldman v. United

540 At stake was an analogous provision concerning permanent

Mexican States.
residents in NAFTA Article 201. Feldman, a US citizen, was also a permanent resident
of Mexico, which argued that as between the two, the dominant status should be treated
as effective, by analogy with the principle of dominant nationality in cases of dual
nationality. The tribunal rejected that view, holding that ‘permanent residents are
treated like nationals in a given State Party only if that State is different from the State

where the investment is made.’**!

But it accepted that the investor might be a
permanent resident of a third State party to the relevant treaty. Transposed to the
present case, this implies that a French national could bring an ECT claim against Italy
if that person was also Swiss permanent resident at the relevant times, i.e., at the time

of the alleged breach and of the request for arbitration.

The EC did not address this issue in its Amicus Brief. Its key argument was that ‘Union
law does not allow Member States to agree investment protection rules inter se, outside
the Union legal order’ ,°#? but this ignores the point that the relevant agreement for

present purposes is between Italy and Switzerland, not an EU Member.

307. In its submission regarding the EC’s Amicus Brief, the Respondent argued that Mr.

Lecorcier was not a Swiss permanent resident at the time of conclusion of the ECT.“
But it is settled that the relevant time for consent is the date of filing the Application.**
It also argued that ‘Article 25(2)(a) [of the ICSID Convention] is self-standing and
cannot be softened by reference to the letter of the ECT: either both treaties are
satisfied, and the Claimants are nationals of a Contracting State, or they cannot receive
protection under an ICSID arbitration.’*** In its oral argument in closing, Italy took
the different point (and took it rather diffidently) that under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention Mr. Lecorcier was appearing as a French national and that he could not
thereafter rely on a different status for the purposes of application of substantive law.™“°
But under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention there is no necessary identity between
the provision conferring jurisdiction (and standing under the Convention), on the one

hand, and that determining the substantive law, on the other hand.

308. If it were necessary to do so, the Tribunal would be inclined to uphold Mr. Lecorcier’s
standing under the ECT as a Swiss permanent resident, though that would be limited
to a claim for damages suffered by him personally. But where the primary victim of a
breach is a company, any remedy would normally enure to the benefit of the company,
avoiding potential difficulties including double recovery.” The Claimants made it
clear that their primary claim was that of Blusun itself, which on any view is an intra-
EU claim.

(g) Conclusion

309. For these reasons, and in common with the other investment tribunals which have
considered the question, the Tribunal rejects the intra-EU objection to its jurisdiction.

In its view, the ECT continues to apply inter se, as between the member states of the

EU, under international law. The Tribunal accordingly has jurisdiction over the claims

of all three Claimants.

xX. THE MERITS: THE TRIBUNAL’S APPRECIATION

310. The Claimants’ case on the merits is comparatively simple. It was put in opening as

follows:

there was no other large solar project comparable to that of the Claimants’

built in Italy in the years 2010 and 2011. This was due to the lack of

construction project financing, which in turn was the result of the legal

insecurity created by the Italian State. On this record, there is thus a clear

causal link between the series of measures adopted by Italy and the project’s

failure. Because of the persisting legal insecurity created by the state,

potential investors were deterred from investing in the project during the

period from March 2010 to September 2011. Then the self-redress

proceedings and stop-work orders gave the final blow to the project in late

201 Mearly 2012.
As this passage in effect concedes, the immediate cause of the Project’s failure was
the absence of construction financing. Lacking completely any revenue and with
substantial debts, the insolvency of the project companies was inevitable. Italy is to
be held responsible for this failure, according to the Claimants’ case theory, because it
caused legal insecurity in the relevant period in breach of the ECT, and this was the

effective cause of the failure to attract financing.

311. In support of this general claim, the Claimants rely separately on Articles 10(1), first
sentence (legal stability), 10(1), second sentence (fair and equitable treatment, with
emphasis on legitimate expectations), and 13 (expropriation) of the ECT.**° These

three claims will be taken in turn,
A The Legal Instability Claim: ECT Article 10(1)

312. Article 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments
in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all
times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and
equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant
protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded
treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including
treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it
has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any
other Contracting Party.

1. The interpretation of Article 10(1)

The key obligation on which the Claimants rely for their legal instability claim is the
obligation to ‘encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area’

(Article 10(1), first sentence), Reference should also be made to the following

definition in Article 1(8):

(8) ‘Make Investments’ or ‘Making of Investments’ means establishing new
Investments, acquiring all or part of existing Investments or moving into
different fields of Investment activity.

In PSEG Global v. Turkey, the tribunal found a breach of the fair and equitable

treatment (FET) standard by reference to what it described as:

... the ‘roller-coaster’ effect of the continuing legislative changes. This is
particularly the case of the requirements relating, in law or practice, to the
continuous change in the conditions governing the corporate status of the
Project, and the constant alternation between private law status and
administrative concessions that went back and forth.**°

In the same vein, the tribunal, while emphasising the relevance of the changing
attitudes and policies of the administration, concluded that ‘[s]tability cannot exist in

a situation where the law kept changing continuously and endlessly, as did its

interpretation and implementation.

°51 This was not a decision under the ECT;

moreover, the ‘roller-coaster’ dictum was only one among several reasons the tribunal

gave for its finding of breach. It remains to be seen whether a similar analysis could
be applied to Article 10(1) of the ECT.

. According to the Respondent, the answer is no, for a variety of reasons.

(a)

(b)

552

The language of the first sentence is vague and generic, and overlaps with the
following sentences, thus favouring ‘an interpretation that conceives the first
sentence of Art. 10 in terms of general duty, as a chapeau of a legal “container”
— the whole Art. 10.1 — which includes specific and binding obligations for
states (such as the FET and the principle of non-discrimination).’°°? But the
first sentence is not in merely preambular terms, nor is it (unlike Article 10(2))
expressed as a mere aspiration. Indeed, all five sentences in Article 10(1)
are framed as obligations of apparently equal weight, and all use the mandatory
‘shall.’ It is true that there is considerable flexibility allowed by terms such as
‘encourage’, ‘favourable’ and ‘transparent’, but the same is true of ‘equitable’
which, at least in the second sentence in the familiar copula ‘fair and equitable’,
the Respondent acknowledges to have a determinate meaning. On the footing
that the term ‘stable’ does not mean rigid or unchanging (which the Claimants

do not suggest) the first sentence can nonetheless be given due effect.

But only in accordance with its actual language; the Respondent emphasises
the limited scope of the phrase ‘Make investments’ when read with the

definition in Article 1(8). Once the Claimants had acquired the lands and rights

*® In its Counter-Memorial, paras, 365-366, 378, the Respondent argued that claims under Art.10(1), first
sentence, were ‘not directly enforceable by investors.’ The argument was not pursued in the Rejoinder or
subsequently, and rightly not.

“SS Rejoinder, para. 91.

54 Art. 10(2) provides that:

 

‘Each Contracting Party shall endeavour to accord to Investors of other

Contracting Parties, as regards the Making of Investments in its Area, the Treatment described in paragraph
(3 (emphasis added). Para. (3) describes MEN or national treatment ‘as regards the Making of Investments.”

associated with the Project, they had made their investment: thereafter they did
not establish new investments, acquire all or part of existing investments or
move into different fields of investment activity. The ‘stability’ element of

Article 10(1), first sentence, is thus inapplicable here in its own terms.5°>

In the Tribunal’s view, little turns on the interpretive argument based on Article
1(8), because the second sentence of Article 10(1) goes on to stipulate that the
stable conditions to be created under the first sentence ‘shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other
Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment’ (emphasis added). In effect,
as various tribunals have pointed out, the obligation to create stable conditions
is conceived as part of the FET standard which is generally applicable to
investments by virtue of the second sentence.*° The Respondent in effect

agrees:

the obligation of FET ... already contains the requirements of
stability and transparency of the treatment. The FET standard
represents the mandatory specification of the general provision
contained in the first sentence. On the other hand, it is not clear
which state conduct could be considered lawful on the basis of the
FET standard and unlawful on the basis of Art. 10.1 first sentence.**”

316. On the basis that Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT apply to a ‘legal

instability’ claim said to arise in the course of an existing investment, the next question

is the scope of the host state’s obligation in that regard. The Claimants referred to a

number of cases in which tribunals were supportive of such claims.**

The decision in Charanne B.V. Construction Investments S.A.R.L. v. Kingdom of Spain

deserves attention as the first of many pending ‘green energy’ cases under the ECT to

be decided on the merits,>*?

and at the Tribunal’s request it was the subject of detailed
argument in closing. That was not really a ‘legal stability’ claim, as later developments
in Spanish legislation (especially the 2013 Law) were excluded from the tribunal’s
jurisdiction as a result of the way the claimant framed its case: the effect was to focus
on a single law of 2010. The tribunal, having affirmed its jurisdiction, rejected the
claim, on the ground that the laws in force were subject to reasonable change
consistently with the fair and equitable treatment standard and that there could be no
legitimate expectation to the contrary. In particular, the tribunal drew a sharp
distinction between a ‘regulatory standard’ and ‘a specific commitment of the state’,

as in the following passage:

Although RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were directed to a limited group
of investors, it does not make them to be commitments specifically directed
at each investor. The rules at issue do not lose the general nature that
characterizes any law or regulation by their specific scope. To convert a
regulatory standard into a specific commitment of the state, by the limited
character of the persons who may be affected, would constitute an excessive
limitation on power of states to regulate the economy in accordance with
the public interest.°°°

Tt concluded:

under international Jaw ... in the absence of a specific commitment toward
stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory
framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at
any time to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest. 5°!

But this did not mean the ECT imposed no constraint on legislative change:

an investor has a legitimate expectation that, when modifying the existing
regulation based on which the investment was made, the State will not act
unreasonably, disproportionately or contrary to the public interest.

Ad

As for proportionality, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that this criterion is
satisfied as long as the changes are not capricious or unnecessary and do not
amount to suddenly and unpredictably eliminat[ing] the essential
characteristics of the existing regulatory framework.*©?
The Spanish laws at stake in that case did not breach ECT Article 10 because in the
tribunal’s view they ‘introduce[d] limited amendments to the regulatory framework
existing at the time of the investment without eliminating its essential characteristics,

in particular the existence of a guaranteed tariff throughout the life of the facility.’*°

Of the three criteria suggested in Charanne, ‘public interest’ is largely indeterminate
and is, anyway, a judgement entrusted to the authorities of the host state. Except
perhaps in very clear cases, it is not for an investment tribunal to decide, contrary to
the considered view of those authorities, the content of the public interest of their state,
nor to weigh against it the largely incommensurable public interest of the capital-
exporting state. The criterion of ‘unreasonableness’ can be criticized on similar
grounds, as an open-ended mandate to second-guess the host state’s policies. By
contrast, disproportionality carries in-built limitations and is more determinate. It is a
criterion which administrative law courts, and human rights courts, have become

accustomed to apply to governmental action.

The present Tribunal, on the basis of a balanced interpretation of the text of Article 10
read in the light of its object and purpose, and having due regard to the course of its

interpretation so far, would reach the following conclusions:

(1) The five sentences of Article 10(1) embody commitments towards investments, in

accordance with their terms. None is merely preambular or hortatory.

(2) The requirement to ‘encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and

transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make

5® Tbid., paras, 513, 517. In contrast Arbitrator Tawil (dissenting) held that ‘when an investor complies with
all the requirements established by the legislation in force to be granted a specific and particular benefit, its
subsequent ignorance by the host State of the investment violates a legitimate expectation’ contrary to ECT
Art. 10(1) (dissenting opinion, para. 12).

53 Thid., para. 539.

Investments in its Area’ is not limited to the initial making of the investment but

includes subsequent extensions of the investment as well as changes of form.

(3) But the core commitment is that in the second sentence, expressly included in the
first, ‘to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties
fair and equitable treatment’ (emphasis added). This incorporates the fair and
equitable treatment standard under customary international law and as applied by

tribunals.**

(4) That standard preserves the regulatory authority of the host state to make and
change its laws and regulations to adapt to changing needs, including fiscal needs,

subject to respect for specific commitments made.

(5) In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant
subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But
if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should
be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative
amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of
recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier

regime.

2. The legal instability claim

320. The Claimants’ case as pleaded largely turns on the claim of legal instability:

Our claim is not that Italy’s legislation had to remain immutable,
unchanged, written in stone. This case is not about regulatory change; it’s
about regulatory turbulence. It concerns the fact that during the two years
between permissible and legally impossible, the legal framework for the
project constantly changed, leaving no period of stability in which the
requisite capital investment for a project of this size could be realised.*°*

323.

The Claimants identify four occasions of damaging legal instability in relation to the
Puglia Project: (a) the Constitutional Court decision and its aftermath; (b) the Romani
Decree and the Fourth Energy Account; (c) the uncertainties associated with the
publication of multiple lists of eligible plants by GSE; and (d) the Brindisi stop-work
order and related events. They do not, however, suggest that these events were directly
linked or that the sequence was the result of any design on the part of the Italian State.
This was no conspiracy but a series of disconnected acts of alleged disregard for their
rights. Whether there was a breach of Article 10(1), first sentence, of the ECT must
therefore fall to be determined, at least in the first instance, by examining each of the

state acts complained of against ECT standards.

(a) Decision 119 of 26 March 2010 of the Constitutional Court

. In December 2008, the central Government initiated proceedings before Italy’s

Constitutional Court challenging, inter alia, the constitutionality of Article 3 of
Puglia’s Regional Law 31/2008 which provided for DIA authorisations for plants with
electric power capacity between 20 KW and 1 MW. The central Government argued
that Article 3 of Puglia’s Regional Law 31/2008 infringed Legislative Decree
387/2003 which permitted the application of the simplified DIA procedure only to
plants with capacity up to 20 KW whereas the Puglia Region contended that the
Regional Law fell within Puglia’s concurrent jurisdiction under Article 117 of the

Italian Constitution.*°° There was no parallel challenge to Regional Law 1/2008.57

The Constitutional Court, in March 2010 (a not-unreasonable delay of 15 months),
upheld the challenge. In its decision of 26 March 2010, the Constitutional Court found
that Article 3(1) and (2) of Regional Law 31/2008 was contrary to Article 12(5) of
Legislative Decree 387/2003 and declared it unconstitutional. The Court held:

... the regional provision is illegal, since higher thresholds of generation

capacity and characteristics of the installation sites for which the DIA
procedure can be used can be identified only by means of a decree of the

*6° Corte Cost., 26 marzo 2010, n. 119 (Constitutional Court, 26 March 2010, No. 119), Exhibit CL-81.

567 Some 38 of 120 plants making up the Puglia project were authorized under Regional Law 1/2008 and were
unaffected by the decision: Transcript, Day 2, 183:2-10 (Bacchiocchi).

Minister of Economic Development, in consultation with the Minister for

the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and Sea, in agreement

with the Joint Conference, without the possibility for the Region to identify

them on its own.. °°
Under Article 136 of the Italian Constitution, a provision that is declared
unconstitutional ceases to have effect on the day following the publication of the
decision by the Constitutional Court. But according to Italian case law, Constitutional
Court’s decisions declaring the unconstitutionality of a law have no retroactive effect
on ‘consolidated relationships’ (‘rapporti esauriti? or ‘rapporti consolidate’)
“Consolidated relationships’ stem from judgments or administrative acts which are

final (i.e. can no longer be challenged).

. The Government took the position that the DIA status of plots which had been fully

processed under Regional Law 31/2008 was ‘consolidated’ and was thus unaffected

by the decision. It responded in these terms to an inquiry on behalf of Eskosol.5”°

However, as recounted in paragraphs 93-95 above, the Salva/Alcoa law of 13 August
2010 somewhat muddied the waters: in providing a special 150-day time limit for DLA
applications in progress, the Law was taken by some as impliedly abrogating the status

of consolidated relationship for other applications.

Watson, Farley and Williams acting on behalf of Eskosol sought clarification on this
point: in a letter of 3 December 2010, the Department of Legal Affairs of GSE

responded as follows:

Tf the plants authorized between August and September 2008, comply
with all the requirements, including with the technical standards resulting
from the applicable rules, such as the decisions of the Authority for the
Electric Energy and Gas, and unless the competent administrative
authorities should rule in a different manner with regard to the interpretation
of Article 1 - quater of the Decree Law 105/2010 approved, with its

amendments, by Law 129/2010, it is held that admission to the incentives
under the so-called Energy Account is possible, in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the applicable legislation.*”!

328. Shortly thereafter, the Ministry of Economic Development issued a Circular clarifying
the effects of the Constitutional Court's decision. Reciting that it was based on
‘numerous requests for Clarification’, the Circular made it clear that the decision had
no effect on consolidated relationships, and as to pending DIAs it extended the time

limit for connection to the grid to 16 January 2011.5” The Circular sought

to set a regulatory balance between ~ on the one hand — the protection of
the legitimate reliance of operators who have achieved a qualifying title on
the basis of regional laws subsequently declared unconstitutional and — on
the other hand — not allowing for an indefinite time the entry into operation
of plants which do not comply with the prevailing national framework.”

329. The Tribunal would make the following points with respect to this episode:

(a) The Government’s challenge before the Constitutional Court was duly filed and

was plainly arguable.

(b)

The challenge was filed well before the Claimants made their investment. The

fact of the challenge was public knowledge and was known to the Claimants.*”*

(c

The decision did not result in a loss of rights to Blusun or its affiliates. True,
there seems to have been some initial market uncertainty, which the Government
might have done more to dispel. But there was no real doubt about the applicable
legal regime in case of a declaration of unconstitutionality, and the Government

did not fail to act with due diligence.

(d

In any event, the content of the public law of the host state (including its process

of determining the constitutionality of laws) is a matter on which investors like

anyone else have access to independent advice. If it avoids outright

misrepresentation, the Government does not offer warranties in that regard.

(e

To conclude, in proceeding with the Project in full knowledge of the pending
constitutional challenge, the Claimants took the risk that the challenge might

succeed, and that this might cause delay over the Project and its financing.°”°

For these reasons, the Constitutional Court decision and its aftermath did not breach

Article 10(1), first sentence, of the ECT.

(b) The Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account

EU Directive 2009/28 was implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree 28 of 3 March
2011,57° also known as the ‘Romani Decree’ after the name of the new Italian Minister
for Economic Development. The Romani Decree gave rise in turn to the Fourth
Energy Account. The Tribunal notes that European Directives, while giving States
some discretion, impose obligations on them. In the case of EU Directive 2009/28,
Member States were required to ‘bring into force the laws, regulations and
administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 5 December
2010.57

332. The Romani Decree amended the conditions for access to feed-in tariffs under the

S15

Third Energy Account of photovoltaic plants with capacity up to 1 MW. In particular,
it sharply limited the applicability of the Third Energy Account (originally covering
plants that became operative between 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2013) to
photovoltaic plants that commenced operations by 31 May 2011 (Article 25(9)).

As the Saluka tribunal pointed out in a different context (Saluka v. Czech Republic, Exhibit CL-39, para.

360), an investor who is aware of a difficulty at the time of investing can have no expectation of remedial
action.

335.

In addition, the Romani Decree introduced modifications in the criteria for eligibility
to the feed-in tariffs of photovoltaic plants installed in agricultural areas. Under Article
10(4) photovoltaic plants located in agricultural areas would be eligible for feed-in
tariffs on the condition that their capacity was below | MW and they occupied less
than 10% of the plot of land where they were installed. Plants belonging to a single
owner would additionally have to be located at a distance of at least 2 km from one
another. Yet these amended conditions would not be applicable to photovoltaic plants
located in agricultural areas which obtained a DIA authorisation prior to the entry into
force of the Romani Decree (i.e., 29 March 2011) on condition that the plants came
into operation within one year from its entry into force (i.e., 29 March 2012) (Article

10(6)).57*

Finally, Article 25(10) of the Romani Decree contemplated the adoption of a
Ministerial Decree that would elaborate on the feed-in tariffs scheme applicable to
photovoltaic plants not covered by the Third Energy Account, namely plants that
commenced operation subsequent to 31 May 2011. The Romani Decree set specific
principles according to which the Ministerial Decree had to be enacted, namely:
introduction of an annual maximum limit of cumulative electric power generated by
photovoltaic plants that could benefit from feed-in tariffs; determination of feed-in-
tariffs considering the decreasing cost of the plants on the one hand and the incentive
schemes employed by other EU Member States on the other hand; and application of

requirements qualifying persons to benefit from the feed-in tariffs.°”"

Against this backdrop, the Fourth Energy Account was adopted by Ministerial Decree
of 5 May 2011.°*° The Fourth Energy Account applied to photovoltaic plants that were

connected to the grid between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2016, for an indicative

57% See also Article 10(5) providing that the conditions of Article 10(4) would not apply to land abandoned
for at least 5 years.

target of installed power at the national level of about 23,000 MW, corresponding to
an indicative annual cumulative cost of incentives estimated to be between EUR 6 and

7 billion (Article 1(2)).

The Fourth Energy Account qualified large plants as plants not falling under the
category of small plants, the latter being photovoltaic plants with capacity up to 1 MW
installed on buildings; other photovoltaic plants with capacity up to 200 KW operating
under net metering (‘scambio sul posto’) and photovoltaic plants of any capacity
installed on buildings and areas owned by the public administration (Article 3(1)(u)
and (v)). Under Article 4(2), for the period from | June 2011 until 31 December 2012,
incentives available to large plants would be limited to specific amounts (Article 4(2)).
Photovoltaic plants would receive the feed-in tariff in force on the date of their entry

into operation (Article 6(4)) which would apply for 20 years (Article 12(2)).

The Fourth Energy Account also adopted Article 10(4) of the Romani Decree with
regard to the eligibility for feed-in tariffs of photovoltaic plants installed in agricultural
areas (Article 11(2)(e)). Furthermore, Article 12(5) of the Fourth Energy Account
provided that:

For the purposes of the allocation of feed-in tariffs, several photovoltaic
plants belonging, or attributable to, the same responsible entity and located
either within the same or within contiguous cadastral parcels of land shall
be considered a single plant of a capacity equal to the cumulative capacity
of the individual plants. ...

The ‘responsible entity’ was defined as the entity in charge of the plant’s operation
and maintenance, which was entitled to request and access feed-in tariffs and to apply

for inclusion in the GSE register (Article 3(1)(s)).

The Claimants argue that ‘[t]he Romani Decree was so drastic that it led to an outcry

on the Italian market’,**! and that it was in effect a paradigm of the legal instability at

which Article 10(1) of the ECT is directed: ‘it was the legislation that led to the loss

of the project.’>**

According to the Respondent, the Romani Decree was an implementation by Italy of
EU Directive 2009/28/EC, aimed at achieving the objective of a share of at least 20%
of energy from renewable sources on gross final consumption of energy in the EU; its
timing was due both to the implementation deadline of the Directive and to the rapid
progress being made (with associated expense) in achieving the targets set for the Third
Energy Account.*** According to Italy, its aim with the adoption of this measure was
‘to reconcile the development of renewable energy with the protection of the
environment, territory and landscape’ and to combine it ‘with the need to gradually
reduce the expansive investment trend in photovoltaic, in order to meet the quantitative
targets envisaged under the EU scheme.’**

One major aim of the legislation was to impose a cumulative cap on incentives, in view
of their success in attracting investment. The corollary was a reduction in feed-in

tariffs, which for the Puglia Project would have been in the order of 13%,
which, while not drastic, was capable of having a serious effect on the economics of

the Project.

The changes concerning agricultural land — in particular the change from a 50% land
ratio allowance for photovoltaic plants to a 10% allowance — had a particular impact
on investors, such as the Claimants, who had already acquired the land and who found
themselves in the position of having to acquire much more land to support the same

size of plant. ‘The effect ... was that for projects like that of the Claimants, where the

the plants, it simply wasn’t viable to go forward ...”5*°

. In applying to the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account the standard of legal

stability incorporated in Article 10(1), first and second sentence, of the ECT

(paragraph 319 above), the Tribunal would make the following points:

(a) The reduction in FITs was quite substantial, but was not in itself crippling or
disabling. Moreover, it was a response to a genuine fiscal need, given the large

take-up under the earlier Energy Accounts.

(b) The reduction in incentives was proportionately less than the reduction in the cost
of photovoltaic technology during 2010, and left Italian subsidy levels higher than

those in Germany, France and Spain.**”
(c) The principle of guaranteed tariffs for a 20-year period was maintained.
(d) So too was the criterion for qualification for FITs, viz., connection to the grid.

(e) The grace period for grid connection to preserve the pre-existing tariff level, viz.,

12 months, was reasonable.

(f) The Fourth Energy Account, applying to photovoltaic plants connected to the grid
between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2016, made some allowance for projects

that could not meet the cut-off of 12 months.

(g) Leaving aside questions of administration (dealt with below), the provision for a

register of large plants eligible for feed-in tariffs contributed to legal security.

(h) The limits on the use of agricultural land were motivated by valid rural planning
concerns, although their specific impact on the Puglia Project is a matter to which

the Tribunal will return (see paragraphs 403-408).

For these reasons the Tribunal concludes that the Romani Decree and the Fourth
Energy Account, taken overall, were not disproportionate, did not violate specific
commitments made to the promotors of PV plants, and did not breach Article 10(1),

first sentence, of the ECT.

(c) The publication of the GSE lists of large plants

As noted, the Fourth Energy Account established a register of large plants eligible for
feed-in tariffs (‘registro dei grandi impianti’) which would be administered by the
GSE (Article 8(1)). The GSE published technical regulations*** for the enrolment of
large plants to the register (Article 8(9)). The deadline for the submission of enrolment
requests to the GSE register for purposes of eligibility for feed-in tariffs in 2011 was
30 June 2011 (Article 8(2)).°*° The GSE was required to publish the list and ranking
of photovoltaic plants admitted to the register within 15 days of the enrolment
application deadline (Article 8(3)).5%°

Under Article 6(2), large plants that came into operation by 31 August 2011 were
automatically eligible for feed-in tariffs. Large plants that entered into operation
between 1 September 2011 and 31 December 2012 had to be listed in the register and
would benefit from feed-in tariffs provided that their ranking on the register so allowed
and that their certificate of work completion was sent to the GSE within seven months
(or nine months for plants with electric power capacity above | MW) from the date of

publication of the ranking (Article 6(3) and 8(4)).°*!

Project. The amended list contained a note that inclusion of a plant in the list did
not guarantee its access to incentives unless the GSE verified its compliance with all
conditions following the commencement of the plant’s operations. This can be taken

as a representation, albeit conditional, as to qualification for incentives.

Article 8(5) of the Fourth Energy Account provided for the removal from the GSE list
of listed plants that commenced their operations by 31 August 2011.59 As some plants

were removed from the GSE list pursuant to this provision, the GSE published an

349. The Claimants argue that:

One of the main innovations of the Fourth Energy Account was the
creation of a register of plants eligible for feed-in tariffs, administered by
the GSE, and based on a ranking system. As noted in the Memorial, no
investor would invest before it was confirmed that the project’s plants
were included in the register and therefore eligible for feed-in tariffs. As
also explained in the Memorial, the GSE published a series of lists of
eligible plants between July and September 2011. The GSE’s withdrawal
of a list infected with errors and publication of multiple additional lists
gave rise to confusion and consternation on the Italian solar market. It
was only with the publication of the final list that investors had certainty
on which plants were eligible.°?”

350. At the time, the Claimants welcomed the GSE listing procedure as providing
certainty,°** although certainty was not in fact achieved for some time. But almost all
the Claimants’ plants were included on all the lists,*°? and given the other difficulties
Blusun was experiencing in obtaining finance and completing the Project in the now
shorter time-scale, the Tribunal has doubts as to the deterrent effect of the delay. It
will return to this issue in its discussion of causation, but for present purposes it is
sufficient to hold that Italy acted in good faith in the difficult task of compiling a full
list, given the rapidly changing construction scene, and that in doing so it did not

breach any applicable standards of due diligence.

(d) The Brindisi stop-work order
The Claimants argue that the stop-work order was the final blow to the Project,
preventing the construction even of the two projected plants by the deadline laid down
in the Fourth Energy Account and thereby ensuring the bankruptcy of the project

companies.

. On 17 November 2011, the environmental protection unit of the local police inspected

a construction site of the Claimants’ Project and requested the relevant DIA
authorisations. On 21 November 2011, the police communicated its inspection
observations to the local prosecutor and the Municipality of Brindisi. According to
the police observations, no construction works of photovoltaic plants, or even
construction of the surrounding fence, took place by the Claimants, contrary to what
was stated in three letters of 1 March 2010 notifying the commencement of works.°!
Furthermore, the policy stated that the Claimants’ plants were contiguous and were
associated to a single developer, namely Eskosol, the owner of the local development
companies holding the DIA authorisations for the two plants under construction at the

time.

On 2 December 2011, the local prosecutor notified the Municipality of Brindisi that

the situation as has been observed by the police constituted a criminal offense violating

602

zoning regulations.“ The local prosecutor was of the opinion that:

... the intent of the owners of this business project was to proceed with an
artificial division of several plants in order to circumvent the procedure for
the issuance of a construction permit by the region.

The local prosecutor referred to Italian case law according to which:

In the construction industry, in the event that an operation performed on the
basis of a declaration of the initiation of activity (DIA) would not be legally
permissible under the legal framework, because it fails to fulfil its
requirements, the works shall be considered as abusive and constitute an
offence as set forth in art. 44, b) D.P.R. n. 380 of 2001, given the inefficacy
of the presented DIA and the eventual expiration of the time limit for the
P.A. to adopt injunctive measures.°*

The local prosecutor further relied upon Circular Note 1/2008 on the mode of
calculation of the electric power capacity of plants belonging to a single owner or a

unitary industrial project.

354. On 19 December 2011, in response to the local prosecutor’s letter, the Municipality of

Brindisi launched self-redress proceedings (‘autorutela’) with the view to reviewing
DIA authorisations obtained for the construction of the Claimants’ Project.*% As
required by the applicable law, the Municipality of Brindisi requested interested parties
to submit written memoranda or other material that would provide clarification on the

police findings.©°

355. On 11 January 2012, the Municipality of Brindisi issued a stop-work order (‘inibizione

dell 'atrivita edilizia’) preventing the progress of works on a few of the photovoltaic
plants of the Claimants’ Project and questioning the validity of the DIA authorisations
acquired.©’ Eskoso! suspended the construction works and challenged the municipal

order before the competent Administrative Court.

356. On 13 January 2012, the Regional Administrative Court of Puglia - Lecce as a

precautionary measure suspended the stop-work order issued by the Municipality of

Brindisi.°°* On 7 March 2012, the Regional Administrative Court annulled for excess

of power the decisions of the municipality of Brindisi to initiate self-redress
proceedings and to issue a stop-work order. The tribunal held that Regional Law
31/1998 ‘sets the conditions stated at the time of the submission of the application or
to the previous two years, so that there is no reference in the law regarding the need
for the requirement to subsist afterwards’, and noted that the transfer from the SPV to
Eskosol took place after the DIA application. It further held that the Municipality’s
order ‘is not expressly related to’ the Constitutional Court’s decision of 26 March
2010, ‘so that the specific situation cannot receive the qualification of “consolidated”
and is therefore outside of the ambit of the legal regime created by’ that decision.°?

The Claimants argue that the stop-work order was the ‘final blow to the project.’®!° Its
rather rapid suspension by the Regional Administrative Court was irrelevant, given the
penalties that could have been imposed had the Municipality’s position been upheld
by the Court on the merits.°!! By the time the final decision was taken it was too late

to meet the shortened deadline for connection laid down in the Fourth Energy Plan.

8. Once again, two separate issues are raised: did the episode involve a breach of the
ECT, and what was its effect on the failure of the Project? Only the former question

is considered here.°!?

9. There is a certain similarity between the stop-work episode and the takeover of a
failing industrial plant by the Mayor of Palermo in the ELS/ case.°'? At issue in both
cases was the implications for the fair and equitable treatment standard of a municipal
intervention subsequently held municipally unlawful. In both cases the intervention

law. But that is where the similarity ends. There is a marked difference between the
requisitioning of a plant for 6 months and a short-term stop-work order. It was not
apparent on what legal basis the Mayor of Palermo intervened to requisition a factory,
whereas the Municipality of Brindisi set out a coherent concern about the legality of
the works, albeit not one which the Regional Administrative Court was willing to
accept. Above all, the Claimants were able to challenge the stop-work order, obtain
immediate interim relief and get a final decision in less than two months. By contrast,
ELST’s administrative appeal to the Prefect of Palermo took 17 months to be decided.

Yet the Chamber held there had been no breach of the FCN treaty in the ELS! case.

In the Tribunal’s view, the stop-work episode did not involve any beach of the ECT.
Nor (for that matter) was it a function of ‘legal instability.’ The order was temporary
in effect, was legally motivated, and was dealt with by due process of law and with
reasonable promptness. It was not arbitrary or discriminatory, but fell well within the
range of legal risk of an industrial enterprise, in particular one based on debatable

regulatory grounds (see above, paragraph 268).
(e) Cumulative effect of the various episodes

Faced with an itemized analysis of the various episodes, the Claimants argue that it is
a mistake to look at them separately: it is their cumulative effect in causing the failure
of the Project that matters.°'* They cite in support the following passage from El Paso

v. Argentina:

Although they may be seen in isolation as reasonable measures to cope
with a difficult economic situation, the measures examined can be viewed
as cumulative steps which individually do not qualify as violations of
FET, as pointed out earlier by the Tribunal, but which amount to a
violation if their cumulative effect is considered. It is quite possible to
hold that Argentina could pesify, put a cap on the Spot Price, etc., but that

a combination of all these measures completely altered the overall

framework.°!>
In El Paso, the tribunal even defined the collection of acts which led to a forced sale
of the investor’s Argentine shareholdings as a ‘composite breach’ in the sense of
Article 15 of the ILC Articles.''° But for the purposes of that case it was not necessary
to go so far. Article 15 only applies to a breach ‘through a series of acts or omissions
defined in aggregate as wrongful’ — for example, genocide.*!” The first two sentences
of ECT Article 10(1) do not define an aggregate of acts as wrongful in the way that

Article 1 of the Genocide Convention does.

A breach of an obligation to ‘encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors’ including ‘to accord at all times ... fair and
equitable treatment’ could be breached by a single transformative act aimed at an
investment, or by a program of more minor measures, or by a series of measures taken

without plan or coordination but having the prohibited effect.

But the fair and equitable treatment standard which, by virtue of the second sentence,
is at the core of the obligation of stability under the first sentence has a relatively high
threshold. The E/ Paso tribunal spoke of ‘a total alteration of the entire legal setup for
foreign investments’, and added that ‘all the different elements and guarantees just
mentioned can be analysed as a special commitment of Argentina that such a total
alteration would not take place.’®'® The tribunal in LG&E spoke of ‘completely
dismantling the very legal framework constructed to attract investors.’°’? — The

emphasis is on the subversion of the legal regime.

365.

In the Tribunal’s view, the various acts complained of here do not reach, or breach,
this standard in aggregate any more than they do individually. The Constitutional
Court proceedings pre-existed the investment and recourse to the Court was itself an
integral part of the Italian legal framework, as was the eventual lack of impact of its
adverse decision on consolidated relationships. The stop-work order — the only
measure taken specifically in relation to the Project — was granted and revoked in a
timely manner and in accordance with rule of law standards. Admittedly the Romani
Decree and the Fourth Energy Account made substantial changes to the regime of
incentives, but they did not abolish incentives for which plant operators had already
qualified, and they gave a reasonable period of time (12 months) for prospective
operators to qualify (see paragraph 342). With respect to these measures, the case for
breach of the stability undertaking in ECT Article 10(1), first sentence, is not

materially stronger when the measures are taken in aggregate than separately.

Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: ECT Article 10(1),
second sentence (legitimate expectations)

The Claimants present an alternative formulation of an Article 10(1) claim based

essentially on legitimate expectations.

In effect it is argued that persons in the
Claimants’ position had a legitimate expectation that the Third Energy Account would

be maintained for the term envisaged:

the Claimants had legitimate expectations that the Third Energy Account
would remain in place for its entire duration according to its terms; that
is, until the end of 2013. However, the Romani Decree frustrated the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations in this respect.°*!
This argument has the effect of treating the law as not a general command but an
individual commitment, at least where the law is enacted for the benefit of a

determinate class of persons.

366. The Claimants’ argument raises several issues. The first is its relationship to their
avowed main claim of legislative instability based on ECT Article 10(1), first sentence.
Evidently if there were ‘legitimate expectations that the Third Energy Account would
remain in place for its entire duration according to its terms’, issues of reasonableness,
proportionality and foreseeableness of changes to that Account would not arise: the
Romani Decree was a transparent breach of any such expectations. The Claimants’
legitimate expectations argument is thus a frank alternative to its more nuanced

argument based on degree of legislative change.

367. As such, it faces the second and more fundamental difficulty, which is that tribunals
have so far declined to sanctify laws as promises. For example, as noted already

(above, paragraph 317), the tribunal in Charanne was clear:

under international law .., in the absence of a specific commitment toward
stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory
framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at
any time to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest.

368. The E/ Paso tribunal made a similar distinction, as follows:

Under a FET clause, a foreign investor can expect that the rules will not be
changed without justification of an economic, social or other nature.
Conversely, it is unthinkable that a State could make a general commitment
to all foreign investors never to change its legislation whatever the
circumstances, and it would be unreasonable for an investor to rely on such
a freeze.

369. As stated by the tribunal in Philip Morris v. Uruguay:

It clearly emerges from the analysis of the FET standard by investment
tribunals that legitimate expectations depend on specific undertakings and
representations made by the host State to induce investors to make an
investment. Provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of
persons or of category of persons, do not create legitimate expectations that
there will be no change in the law.°*4

370. Counsel for the Claimants took exception to this:

371.

the language [in Charanne] that seems to suggest that an investor can't base

a legitimate expectation on a provision of law is unfathomable, because the

law is the most formal statement on which any investor can base an

expectation. How can it possibly be that some kind of representation made

informally to an investor is more significant in terms of international law

analysis than a representation that is made in the form of a law? >
It is true that informal representations can present difficulties, which is why tribunals
have increasingly insisted on clarity and the appropriate authority to give undertakings
binding on the state. It is also true that a representation as to future conduct of the state
could be made in the form of a law, sufficiently clearly expressed. But there is still a
clear distinction between a law, i.e. a norm of greater or lesser generality creating rights
and obligations while it remains in force, and a promise or contractual commitment.
There is a further distinction between contractual commitments and expectations
underlying a given relationship: however legitimate, the latter are more matters to be
taken into account in applying other norms than they are norms in their own right.
International law does not make binding that which was not binding in the first place,
nor render perpetual what was temporary only. In the present case, the expectations
are even less powerful because European law had already lowered them: it was clear
that the incentives offered were subject to modification in light, inter alia, of changing

costs and improved technology.

2. In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies

such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are
lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a
manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and
should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have
committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime. These
considerations apply even more strongly when the context is subsidies or the payment

of special benefits for particular economic sectors.

373. Mr. Marino, Claimants’ witness as to the viability of the Project, argued that:

375.

&

nr

The Claimants, when they entered the Italian market, had reasonable
expectations to find a stable regulatory environment. Actually at the time
one energy account, the First Energy Account, had come to its natural end
in 2007, and the Second Energy Account was going to its natural end in
2010. So there was no reason to believe that an incentive system for PVs
would have come to termination before the date originally planned.°°

But a reasonable market expectation as to some state of affairs, justified or not, is not
a basis for shifting risks to the public sector, i.e. the state budget. Circumstances
change and in the absence of specific commitments, the risk of change is for

entrepreneurs to assess and assume.

. To conclude, the Respondent made no special commitment to the Claimants with

respect to the extension and operation of FITs, nor did it specifically undertake that
relevant Italian laws would remain unchanged. For these reasons the Claimants have

not established a breach of Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT.
Cc. The Issue of Causation in relation to ECT Article 10(1)

Central to the Claimants’ case as pleaded under Article 10(1) is a claim of fact — viz.,
that the real reason for the complete failure of the Project was the legal instability in
Italy arising from a series of events, commencing on 26 March 2010 with the decision
of the Constitutional Court and culminating in January 2012 with the Municipality's
intervention. The Claimants do not suggest that these events were linked or that the
sequence was the result of any design on the part of the Italian State — quite the reverse.
This was no conspiracy but a series of disconnected acts of alleged disregard for their
tights and for the effective commitments made to investors through the various Energy
Accounts. But even if all (or some of them) constituted breaches of the ECT, if they

did not cause the failure of the Project, the Claimants cannot recover.”

376. Certain features of the Project are barely or not at all in dispute:

(a) It was conceived as an integrated project, linking up to 124 small solar plants

together in what would have been, at the time, the largest solar park in Europe.

(b

It relied heavily on the DIA procedure, as made applicable to units with capacity
between 20 KW and 1 MW by Puglia Regional Laws 1/2008 and 31/2008. In
other words, the legality of the Project from a planning point of view depended
on individual approval (under the DIA procedure, deemed approval) of small
plants of less than 1 MW. But its economic viability depended on the cumulation
of those plants into a large aggregated array of up to 124 MW.°* Without being
aggregated, few if any of the plants could have been individually connected to the
grid; their connection depended on their being linked to the two sub-stations by a
large regional network, whose construction Blusun funded, and funded in

advance.

(c

For Blusun itself to arrange the construction of the rings and sub-stations and their
connection to the high-voltage grid was also apparently novel. Earlier projects
had been connected by ENEL, the national operator, but this was time-consuming

and would itself probably have defeated the plan.

(d

The land was acquired and paid for by the project companies (and thus by
Eskosol) at above-market price for agricultural land.°?? In other words, it was
acquired on the assumption that the Project would succeed with full fiscal
incentives. Yet that was not clear at the time Blusun committed to the Project, in
November 2009.

8 As admitted by one of the Claimants in evidence:

you are in the middle of the countryside: ... So if you don’t have the infrastructure for this 120
times 1-megawatt plants, it makes no sense.

(e) The Project never obtained the substantial financing required.
(f) No solar panels were ever installed or (a fortiori) connected.

(g) Work on two plants was commenced, but ceased immediately after the
intervention of the Commune and, despite the prompt lifting of the communal
ban, was never resumed. Even if completed, these few plants could not have

prevented the collapse of the Project.

It is helpful to consider three of these elements in more detail.

1. The status of the DIAs and the Project as a unified scheme

The key to the commercial success of the Puglia Project was its capacity to function
as a unified scheme, attracting FITs for a potential of almost 120 MW while taking

advantage of a DIA procedure designed for individual small plants.

The Claimants relied on the DIAs as amounting to a definitive authorisation for the
individual plants. They refer by way of example to a Notice of the Municipality of
Mesagne with the notation ‘The local development companies obtain the 53d DIA
Certificate of Conformity, stating that the construction of the given solar plants was in
accordance with the relevant regulations.’*° In fact the Notice states in its operative
clause that the DIA procedure ‘is to be regarded as complete’,®?! which is not at all the

same thing.

At no stage did the Claimants obtain unconditional assurances from the central
Government as to their plants’ entitlement to FITs, or to the level of such FITs. Even
if the lists issued by GSE in various versions in July-September 2011 could be

considered as conditional assurances, they were subject to compliance with applicable

terms and conditions, to be assessed as at the date of connection to the grid. Until then

they were contingent.

. Of particular significance was section 31 of Regional Law 31/2008, which provided

as follows:

Plants installed on the ground in an agricultural area which consists of lands

belonging to the same owner, or which is made up of several plots resulting

from the splitting of an area of greater extension carried out within the two

years prior to the application, are considered as a single plant for the

purposes of calculating the maximum electric power for having recourse to

the DIA procedure.®
Referring to this provision, the Watson, Farley & Williams Preliminary Due Diligence
Report of 27 January 2010 recommended that ‘an exhaustive investigation shall be
carried out in order to ascertain that the relevant Regional Law has not been breached

by the plants developed by Nico Energia.’

The Claimants emphasise the due diligence done on the Project, in particular through
the Preliminary Due Diligence Report. They go on to assert that ‘[tJhe report identified
no particular issue with respect either to the construction and connection authorizations
held by the companies ...’°*> But this is not the case: the Preliminary Report focuses
perhaps more on this potential problem than any other. Moreover, a due diligence
exercise (and this one was avowedly incomplete) is or should be carried out for the
client prior to the investment; it does not shift any risk to the state. Nor could it form
the basis for a legitimate expectation vis-a-vis the state that the DIA ‘authorizations’

were secure against challenge.

In fact, the ‘exhaustive investigation’ called for by the Preliminary Due Diligence
Report was not finalised until May 2011. It took the form of a careful but not definitive

opinion on Italian law by a member of the same firm.®* It concluded, for example,

that the use of the 12 SPVs in the DIA process ‘does reduce the risk of such plants
being found as belonging or attributable to the same responsible entity’, thereby
acknowledging that the risk existed. Its overall conclusion was that ‘the risk of the

DIAs being successfully challenged may be regarded as remote.’°*°

385. In the Tribunal’s view, that conclusion (unsupported by any positive representations
made by competent authorities of the Respondent state) significantly under-estimated
the level of risk. There were repeated regulatory warnings in the documentation
against aggregation of DIA-authorized small plants,‘*’ but the economies of scale of
the Puglia Project were entirely dependent on aggregation, and the Project was for

most of its ‘life’ conceived and financed as a whole.°**

386.

a

To conclude, in the Tribunal’s view, the Project ran a significant risk of incurring legal
or administrative difficulties, even if these could be (and in the event largely were)

overcome. Its success was by no means certain.©*?

2. The failure to obtain project financing

387. As has been seen, the Puglia Project depended for its success on substantial and timely
project financing which it never obtained. On the Claimants’ own admission, this was

Italy. The Respondent stressed that many PV plants qualified for FITs, including some large ones. Challenged
to give examples comparable to the Puglia project, the Respondent's witness gave as prime example the ‘Blasi-
Casignano project’: Witness Statement of Danicle Bacchiocchi, pp. 4, 8-11; Transcript, Day 2, 143:7-11
(Bacciocchi). This was a smaller but still substantial linkage of 71 separately owned plants connected before
December 2010 (i.e, under the Third Energy Account), From the Tribunal’s viewpoint, what is most relevant
about this scheme was that it too was the subject of criminal proceedings, emphasizing the element of
regulatory risk in projects whether under Regional Law 1/2008 or Regional Law 31/2008.

reveal anything more than a reluctance by sometimes marginal sources to commit the

necessary funds.

A revealing document in this regard is an e-mail of 21 January 2011 from HSBC,
Blusun’s financial adviser, to Mr. Stein. Headed ‘Eskosol banks project financing’, it
reviews the state of financial negotiations with 16 potential sources.” It is relatively
upbeat and is full of statements such as “Interested in the project. To contact to discuss
new strategy’ — a statement which, concerning as it did a major bank, might have given
pause for thought, since it implies the lack of success of the existing strategy. What is
perhaps more significant, however, is that of six indications given of reasons not to
provide finance, only one expressly mentions ‘political risk concerns’, one mentions
withholding tax issues, and four specifically mention uncertainties about DIA
authorisation. Replete with references to ‘appetite’, the document conveys a distinct

lack of recent appetite to finance the Project. And so it proved.°*!

On 28 February 2011, Eskosol failed to make the 20% down payment for the first
tranche of panels and on 7 March 2011, Siemens suspended performance of the EPC
contract, which was never reinstated (see paragraph 101 above). Eskosol’s failure to

pay predated the Romani Decree of 3 March 2011.

3. The evidence underlying the ‘legal stability’ claim

It is a paradox of the ‘legal stability’ claim that with the (brief) exception of the stop-
work order, the Respondent never denied the legality of the Puglia Project at the time,
or the potential availability of FITs once the plants forming the Project were connected

and started generating. Moreover, as the Respondent repeatedly pointed out, many

40 Email chain between HSBC and M. Stein, 21 January 2011, Exhibit C-159; another 7 financiers, mostly
banks, are mentioned as ‘without concrete follow up.”

© A later e-mail from HSBC relating to another source (Exhibit C-164, 3 March 2011) states ‘unfortunately
it seems they are a cold on the Eskosol project from an authorization standpoint and also due to the current
potentially adverse regulatory trend / uncertainty.’ This refers to both authorisation and regulatory uncertainty,
but in that order.

138

other PV plants did manage to get connected at the time, and to benefit from the still

relatively generous level of FITs.**

392. The Claimants repeatedly invoke reactions of ‘the market’ in general, or particular
customers, in support of their claim. In fact, the evidence before the Tribunal of market
reactions and their relation to the issue of causation is at best equivocal. This issue
was briefly reviewed in paragraph 389 above in the crucial context of financing. Other

evidence is to similar effect:
e Ane-mail from Blusun to another potential funder stated:

We are speaking about 120 x 1 MW projects under a unified Dia
authorization (not attached to the actual Dia discussion), because of
the start of the work of our substation and the local grid.

It received the following immediate reply:

At this point we are only focused on AU projects given the
uncertainty around the legal status of the DIA procedure. But I
appreciate the heads up, and will be sure to let you know if our view
changes.°

e Another similar exchange included the following passage:

Regarding the Validity of the DIA, according to our news, DIA
Projects are only safe if projects are connected to the grid before
January 16th. Otherwise there is a risk that projects could be
challenged within 120 days from the end of the works. In principle
because of this issues [sic] we are not interested in this opportunity
unless there is a way to structure our entrance not taking any DIA
nor financing risk.

- introduction to the local EPC and subcontractor

- introduction in a ready to go project in the very competitive Italian

- Already existing legal and technical diligence ...

The response included the following passage:

Mr. Stein replied:

We are very surprised in getting no follow up from you regarding
our last discussions and mail exchanges. We are going forward on
the project and we need to understand your interest on the project.

The response was as follows:

explanations or additional information but we feel not. Based upon

all the information, we are not confident to pursue the Brindisi
project.

The market was well aware of the distinction between DIA and AU authorisation, a
distinction which predated the Project. Moreover, these exchanges suggest that the
Puglia Project was already in significant financial difficulty in the first months of 2011,

and independently of the Romani Decree.

The Claimants place emphasis on the ‘rescue’ plan for 27 plants proposed at the end
of 2011 (see paragraph 113). The documentation provided in support of this was
limited to a non-binding term sheet ‘for discussion purposes only’, and a signed
agreement of Eskosol’s creditors deferring their claims.°*° As far as appears from the
documentary evidence, work on the 27 plants never commenced: Euro Catalysts, the
proposed financier, does not appear to have closed with the offer, still less paid the
20% down payment, and the legal and technical due diligence reports envisaged in the
term sheet are not in the record. In fact the construction that was interrupted by the
municipal stop-work order of 11 January 2012 (see paragraph 119) was a different one,
to build a mere two plants, which could not have rescued the Project. By the end of
December 2011 (before the Italian legislation of 2012 further affecting agricultural
land), the 27 plants envisaged in the Euro Catalysts term sheet should have been
completed. None of this last-gasp activity persuades the Tribunal that the failure of

the Project was attributable to Italy.

4. Conclusion on Causation

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants have not discharged the onus of proof of
establishing that the Italian state’s measures were the operative cause of the Puglia
Project’s failure. Of far greater weight was the continued dependence on project

financing, and the failure to obtain it was due both to the size of the Project and to

justified concerns about the scope of DIA authorisation, on which the legality of the
Project depended. That being so, the claim under Article 10(1) for loss of the Project

would fail in any event.

5. Overall Conclusions on ECT Article 10(1)

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that there was no breach of Article 10(1) of
the ECT.

. The Expropriation Claim: ECT Article 13

In the further alternative, the Claimants argue that the Italian measures resulted in the
indirect expropriation of the investment, given its total loss of value, contrary to Article
13 of the ECT.

Article 13(1) provides in relevant part as follows:

Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other
Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to a
measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as ‘Expropriation’ except where such
Expropriation is:

(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;
(b) not discriminatory;
(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation.
The notion of indirect expropriation has been defined more or less broadly in the
decided cases, ranging from the sweeping definition in Metalclad Corporation v.

Mexico” to the careful formulation in Electrabel v. Hungary:

°*7 Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States, CISD Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, 30 August 2000,
Exhibit CL-32, para. 103 (Metalclad v. Mexico).

142

400.

As regards indirect expropriation, the Tribunal considers that the wording
of Article 13(1) ECT requires Electrabel to establish that the effect of the
PPA’s termination by Hungary was materially the same as if its investment
in Dunamenti had been nationalised or directly expropriated by Hungary.
In other words, Electrabel must prove, on the facts of this case, that its
investment lost all significant economic value with the PPA’s early
termination.

In none of the decided cases (so far as the Tribunal is aware) has the winding up of an
insolvent company by the investor been treated, in and of itself, as a measure ‘having
effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation’, whether under NAFTA, the ECT
or otherwise. This is true even if the circumstances leading to insolvency included

conduct of the host state in breach of the FET standard.”

. On the other hand, in a number of cases, state measures targeting the company and

imposing major liabilities on it have resulted in insolvency, leading to a finding of
indirect expropriation. For example, in Quasar de Valores v. Russian Federation, the
tribunal held that the liquidation auctions in which a major part of the assets was
acquired by Rosneft ‘were part of the same overall scheme of confiscation.’° The

facts of that case were, of course, remote from those of the present one.

In Nykomb, an ECT case, the tribunal in rejecting a claim of indirect expropriation

said:

The Tribunal finds that ‘regulatory takings’ may under the circumstances
amount to expropriation or the equivalent of an expropriation. The decisive
factor for drawing the border line towards expropriation must primarily be
the degree of possession taking or control over the enterprise the disputed
measures entail.°°!

That was a case of failure to pay the contractually agreed double tariff, in
circumstances where Latvia discriminated in favour of other like-situated generators
to whom that tariff was paid. This was in breach of Article 10(1) ECT, but not Article
13 (on which the claimant also relied).

In the present case, the Respondent, by non-discriminatory laws ostensibly passed in
the public interest, significantly changed the terms laid down in the Third Energy
Account for investment in the green energy sector. These changes, combined with
operational decisions made by the investors and the lack of prearranged Project
financing, meant that the Project remained radically incomplete, never qualified for
feed-in tariffs, and inevitably went into liquidation. As a general matter the situation

was not analogous, still less tantamount, to expropriation of the Project by Italy.°*

402. In responding to a question from the Tribunal as to what exactly had been taken for

the purposes of the Article 13 claim, counsel for the Claimants initially conceded...

that there was no taking of the investment. However, there was a succession

of events that, taken together and in their natural sequence, deprived them

from the benefit of their investment.
The difficulty with this argument lies in its assumption that the Claimants were already
entitled to the full benefit of their investment vis-a-vis the Italian Republic — that is, to
the full benefit of current FITs — without complying with the conditions consistently
imposed on applicants for FITs, i.e. timely completion of the solar panels and their
connection to the grid. And this problem apparently remerges, however the Claimants’
Article 13 case is put. Senior counsel for the Claimants intervened in closing to put

the matter in the following terms:

°52 In closing, counsel for the Claimants also cited Biloune v Ghana as bearing ‘some similarities’ to the present
case: Transcript, Day 6, 34:8-19 (Barrier), citing Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd v. Ghana Investments
Centre and the Government of Ghana, UNCITRAL Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 22 October 1989.
Although Biloune involved a municipal stop order, what was crucial was the combination of actions taken by
various Ghanaian entities — partial demolition of the works, refusal to allow resumption, deportation and
refusal of return. The temporary judicial stay here is in obvious contrast.

Transcript, Day 6, 31:21-24 (Barrier).

What we contend was expropriated was the investments which were lost.

The value of the investments ... was entirely gone or substantially gone.

So the land that was indirectly acquired was worth a fraction of what it

was originally worth. The project companies which we had acquired were

worth nothing. The permits, the authorisations that we had acquired,

although we still retained title to them, had no economic value. And as a

result, all of the investments that we acquired, we were substantially

deprived of.*
The difficulty here lies in the assumption that what the Claimants or their associates
paid for the land was ‘what it was originally worth.’ But what it was originally worth
was its value as agricultural land, and it retained that (low) value after the failure of
the Project. Only if the value of the land as against the Italian Republic is taken to be
its value as a completed Project already entitled to the benefit of current FITs does the
Claimants’ expropriation argument assist. Of course the Claimants argue that the
reason for the failure of the Project, with consequent ‘loss of value’, was the constant
changes in Italian policy and law. That argument, under ECT Article 10, first sentence,
has already been considered. The essential point does not change by invoking Article
13,

. Another possibility concerns the limitations imposed on the use of the agricultural land

acquired by Eskosol, Blusun’s subsidiary, for the construction of PV arrays. These
limitations have already been analysed (see paragraph 104, 120). It could be argued
that the effect of the 10% requirement imposed by the Fourth Energy Account was to
sterilize the land in Blusun’s hands, since the planned PV units could not be installed
without acquiring substantially more land. There is good authority for the proposition
that the sterilization of property in the hands of an investor, rendering it impossible to

use the property for its intended purpose, can amount to indirect expropriation.°*>

2000, Exhibit CL-26, paras. 76-78.

406.

But it is very doubtful that the factual predicate for a sterilization case existed here.
For one thing, the Claimants, who prior to the insolvency retained full control of their
investment, proposed to solve the immediate indebtedness of the Project companies by
constructing 27 solar plants; the plan failed, but not because the land was not available.
According to their pleaded case, the final blow to the Project came with the municipal
stop-work order, which meant that the Fourth Energy Account’s deadlines for
qualifying for feed-in tariffs could not be met. That order and its judicial sequel have
been dealt with already; they did not involve any breach of the ECT, let alone conduct

tantamount to expropriation.

At one point in its pleadings, the Claimants attributed the failure of the Project, in part
at least, to Law Decree 1 of 24 January 2012, Article 65 of which appears to have
shortened the | year time-limit allowed by the Romani Decree by some two months
(see paragraph 120 above). In their Reply and in oral argument the final defeat of
the Project was rather attributed to the municipal stop-work order, which has already
been dealt with (see paragraph 360 above). But since the point was not formally

abandoned, the Tribunal will deal briefly with it.

To make their expropriation case on this basis, the Claimants would have to show (a)
that but for the one year deadline of the Romani Decree, they would have been
expropriated by the change in the land coverage ratio from 50% to 10%; (b) that but
for the January 2012 Law they would have met the 29 March 2012 deadline for the
Project or a substantial part of it (or alternatively would have sold the Project on to a
third party which could have met that deadline), and (c) that they reasonably
abandoned the Project between January and March (or lost a credible opportunity to
sell it on) because of the abrogation of the deadline by Law Decree | of 24 January
2012. But even if point (a) be accepted arguendo, the Claimants do not come close to

establishing either points (b) or (c), essentially for the reasons already stated (see

66 See Memorial, paras, 340-351; Stein WS1, paras, 169-170. In fact, this is not quite clear, since Law
27/2012 (Exhibit CL-68) appears to have reinstated the exception for plants occupying 50% of agricultural
land contained in Art. 10(6) of the Romani Decree, and even extended it slightly to May 2012. The
discrepancies associated with the 2012 legislation were not really explored in argument.

paragraph 393). It is significant that Siemens unilaterally suspended the construction
contract before the Romani Decree, based on non-payment by Eskosol of the initial
deposit, and that it was never reinstated: indeed it was formally terminated by letter of
16 December 2011, before Law Decree 1 of 24 January 2012.7 As to selling it on,
there is no evidence of a credible buyer prepared to take the risk of completion by 29

March 2012. This version of the expropriation case likewise fails.

In the circumstances, the Claimants have not established that any part of the investment
was subject to expropriation or a situation tantamount thereto, contrary to Article 13
of the ECT. The Claimants never lost title to the land which was qua agricultural land
an asset of Eskosol’s in insolvency. The premium paid for the land was at the
Claimants’ risk and was not opposable to Italy. In a context in which Blusun’s failure
to construct the plants or to connect them to the grid was due to its own investment
decisions, notably its failure to attract adequate finance, Italy should not be required to
pick up the tab for Blusun’s failures. To put it in other terms, Blusun had no right or
legitimate expectation to the enhanced value of the land on the footing that the Project
would succeed, This conclusion makes it unnecessary to determine whether changes
in planning regulations involving the use to which agricultural land can be put are

merely regulatory in any event.°*

The point can be made in another way. Blusun acquired agricultural land at a
substantial overprice. At all times it was aware of what it had to do to unlock the extra
value in the land, i.e. to construct the plants and connect them to the grid within
applicable time limits. It failed to comply with those conditions. Even if one were to
hold, hypothetically, that the reduction of land available for power generation from a
ratio of 50% to one of 10% did amount to an indirect expropriation of that fraction of
the land thereby rendered useless for the Project, the value to be attributed to the land

is the value it continued to have — i.e. the value of unimproved agricultural land as at

the date of the Romani Decree. That value did not change: since any additional losses

were at the Claimants’ own risk they are not recoverable under Article 13.

409. For these reasons the Tribunal holds (by a majority, Arbitrator Alexandrov dissenting)

that the expropriation claim under ECT Article 13 must fail.°°

fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in
accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.

©5° Arbitrator Alexandrov disagrees with that conclusion. Blusun acquired agricultural land at a premium. The
value of that land today is much lower, i.e., equal to the value of unimproved agricultural land. This was
caused by the restrictions imposed by Respondent. While one might accept the proposition that Blusun could
have reasonably expected that the tariff regime would change over time (and thus should have accelerated the
construction of the plants), it could not have reasonably expected that the government would impose a
restriction on the use of the land. That restriction is therefore expropriatory. The Award assumes that even
absent the land use restriction the Project would have failed to proceed because of the tariff-related restrictions
and, therefore, the land use restriction alone did not cause any loss of value. This analysis, however, disregards
the equally likely possibility that the Project did not proceed due to the land use restriction. To state it
differently, the Award assumes that the land use restriction had no impact on Blusun’s inability to proceed.
There is, however, no factual basis for this assumption. The land use restriction may have had an equal, if not
greater, impact on the failure of the Project. In that scenario, the damages caused by the land use restriction
would have amounted to half. or more, of the value of the Project. Because the land use restriction amounted
to an indirect expropriation, damages should follow notwithstanding this uncertainty—at a minimum, in the
amount of the lost incremental value of the land.

At the hearing, the Tribunal in consultation with the Parties decided that ‘it is sufficient

if the costs submissions set out the costs and expenses of the parties.’

The Claimants submitted claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made

to ICSID) in the amount of €3,880,337.92, broken down as follows:

© €3,343,908.37 in legal fees and expenses; and

© €536,429.55 in expert fees and expenses.

They also indicated advance on costs and fee payments in the amount of
USD449,920.00.

The Respondent did not file a submission on costs.
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and
by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.
This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration,

including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The Tribunal is conscious of Italy’s delay in raising the EU issue and the re-scheduling
of the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits that became necessary following the EC’s
application to intervene. It will be recalled that the serious difficulties with the
admissibility of the EC’s late application were overcome by the Respondent’s
endorsement of the application. The Respondent could have made the EU law
argument at an earlier stage, but chose to raise separate issues of jurisdiction and
admissibility, which have been rejected. Moreover, this was a substantial claim,

efficiently presented. In the exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2), the Tribunal

has accordingly decided that each party should bear one half of the Tribunal’s costs

and that each party should bear its own costs.

The direct costs of the proceeding include: (i) the fees and expenses of each Member
of the Tribunal; (ii) payments made by ICSID for other direct expenses, such as those
related to the conduct of hearings (court reporting, audio recording, interpretation, and
courier services, as well as estimated charges related to the dispatch of this Award);

and (iii) ICSID’s administrative fees.
