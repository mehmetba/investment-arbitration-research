INTRODUCTION

In its Decision on the Merits dated 10 June 2015, the Tribunal directed, pursuant to

Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, that the Government of

Laos People’s Democratic Republic (the “Government”) be awarded costs against the

Claimant, Laos Holdings (the “Claimant”, as a result of the unsuccessful allegation by the

Claimant of a material breach of the Settlement Agreement dated 15 June 2014 and side

letter dated 17 June 2014 (the “Material Breach Application”).

I.

a)

3.

THE LAW AND THE FACTS
The law
Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (AF) Rules provides that:

Article 58

(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom
the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of
the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end, call on the Secretariat
and the parties to provide it with the information it needs in order to formulate the
division of the cost of the proceeding between the parties.

(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall form
part of the award.

This Article gives a broad discretion to the Tribunal in the allocation of costs,

according to all the circumstances of the case.

b) The facts

4.

Pursuant to the Decision on the Merits, counsel for the Government has submitted

aclaim for fees in the sum of USD $684,007.75 and disbursements of USD $78,698.08 for

a total of USD $762,705.83.

5. The Material Breach Application was based essentially on an allegation that the
Government had either licensed or agreed to license a rival casino contrary to the 50-year
monopoly conferred on the Claimant’s subsidiary by agreement with the Government. The
establishment of a rival casino, according to the Claimant, destroyed much of the value of
its investment and essentially rendered it unmarketable except at an unacceptable discount

to the fair market of its gambling facilities predicated on a monopoly concession.

6. The Government’s ultimate success turned on the testimony of public servants and
other witnesses given at the hearing in Singapore on 13-14 April 2015. The Claimant’s
allegation of a breach of its monopoly was shown to be based on erroneous newspaper
reports and the activities of promoters of a rival casino who acted without the

Government’s approval or encouragement.

7. The Claimant was unable to present direct evidence in support of its Material
Breach Application and such secondary inferences as were available were persuasively

refuted by testimony by the Government officials most directly involved.

8. A list of the submissions, decisions and hearings in the Material Breach Application

is attached hereto as Appendix “‘A” to these reasons.

9. In assessing the Government’s costs of its successful defence, the Tribunal should
attempt to assess a quantum that is fair and reasonable to both parties in all the

circumstances.

c) The Government’s bill of costs
10. The Government’s skeleton bill of costs is set out in a one and a quarter page chart
identifying the lawyers or paralegals who worked on the case, their hourly rate and total
billing for each individual, as well as a statement of disbursements. The document is

attached as Appendix “B” to these reasons.

11. The Tribunal has been provided with little in the way of submissions by either party.

12. The Claimant takes the position that considerable time and costs were unnecessarily
thrown away on an ultimately unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge and related procedural
issues. To further its argument, the Claimant requested copies of the billing records of the
Respondent Government to determine how much time was spent on various unsuccessful
procedures in the course of its defence against the Material Breach Application. The
records were refused by the Government on the basis that at New York law, being the
governing law of the Deed of Settlement, “billing time sheets are privileged and are not
produced to opposing counsel”. The Claimant contests that position. The Tribunal
considers it unnecessary to resolve this particular dispute and will proceed on the basis of

the material now made available to it.

Ill. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS
a) Reasonableness of time and hours spent
13. The Tribunal has taken into account the following considerations:
(a) The quantum of costs claimed by the Government is proportionate to the

importance and the complexity of the issues at stake.

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

The amount of time docketed by the various lawyers and paralegals is not
excessive given the degree of responsibility assumed by counsel acting on

behalf of the Government and the monetary value of the matters in issue.

The rates are reasonable in the surrounding circumstances. Lead counsel
for the Government are experienced lawyers in matters of international
commercial law and their rates are in line with rates charged by counsel of

comparable skill and experience in matters of similar value and complexity.

The work’s organisation was efficient. It appears from the distribution of
hours amongst counsel that appropriate measures were taken by senior
counsel to delegate to more junior counsel (at a lower hourly rate) work

suitable to their level of experience.

In the end result, the Government was entirely successful on the merits in

resisting the Material Breach Application of the Claimant.

b) The unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge

While the Tribunal accepts that the time shown in the Government’s bill of costs

was in fact spent by each of the persons listed, and that their hourly rates are reasonable,
the Government’s success rested almost entirely on the factual evidence presented in
Singapore on 13-14 April 2015. Prior to that date, there was much procedural skirmishing,
particularly in relation to the Government’s unsuccessful challenge to the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal even to embark on its mandate to consider the Claimant’s Material Breach
Application. The Tribunal gave extensive reasons for its conclusion that there was no merit

to this challenge. After the point was decided adversely to the Government, it launched an

4

unsuccessful Request for Re-consideration which essentially repeated the arguments
already made and already rejected by the Tribunal in the original (and unsuccessful)

jurisdictional challenge.

15. In the Tribunal’s view, while the Government was certainly entitled to bring its
jurisdictional challenge, it is not fair and reasonable to ask the Claimant to fully indemnify
the Government against the cost of procedural skirmishing that served no purpose other

than a distraction from the factual issues before the Tribunal.

c) Are there other elements to take into consideration?
16. In the Tribunal’s view, the Government case was made in a professional manner
with due regard to economy and efficiency. However, the assessment of the Government’s
costs must take into account its unnecessary and unsuccessful procedural manoeuvres.
Reference should also be made to the fact that the Claimant lost two successive Requests
for Provisional Measures, respectively dated 19 January 2015 and 2 April 2015. The

Tribunal rejected both requests, respectively on 18 March 2015 and 14 April 2015.

17. As the Government has declined to produce records that would enable the Tribunal
to calculate more precisely the amount of time consumed by its jurisdictional challenges
and related motions, the Tribunal will simply apply a percentage reduction as hereinafter

specified.

d) Disbursements
18. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt the justification for any of the disbursements.
As the Government points out, USD $93,849.00 is a reasonable sum for out-of-pocket

expenses for a ten-month case where the client is in Laos, witnesses were in Laos and Kuala

Lumpur, and hearings were held in Washington and Singapore. The Claimant requested
the presence in Singapore of the Government officials for whose expenses it is now being

called on to pay.

19. The Washington hearing (and associated costs), however, was entirely dedicated to

the Government’s unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge and related issues.

IV. CONCLUSION
20. In light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the quantum of
costs claimed by the Government, exceeds what is fair and reasonable to call upon the

Claimant to pay.

21. As the Government has declined to produce any breakdown of the activities in
respect of which costs are claimed (apart from research on the interpretation of the Deed
of Settlement under New York law and development of the Government’s position in that
regard), the Tribunal is left with the option of assessing a global factor to determine a fair

and reasonable award of costs relative to the work done and the result accomplished.

22. The Tribunal concludes that the decision should be 70% of the total claim of

USD $762,705.83.

23. The Tribunal therefore awards to the Respondent costs and legal fees of

USD $533,894.08.

24. Pursuant to paragraphs 31 and 32 of the Settlement Agreement dated 15 June 2014,

this proceeding remains suspended.
