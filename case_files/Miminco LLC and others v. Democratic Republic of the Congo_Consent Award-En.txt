Republic of the Congo (hereinafter the “Respondent” or the “DRC”), based on provisions
relating to arbitration contained in the bilateral Treaty Concerning the Reciprocal
Encouragement and Protection of Investments entered into between the United States and the

Republic of Zaire on August 3, 1984 and entered into force on July 28, 1989.

2. Following an exchange of correspondence between the Centre and the Claimants, the Deputy
Secretary-General of the ICSID registered the Claimants’ request on June 9, 2003 and notified

Washington of March 18, 1965 (hereinafter “the Convention”).

ICSID (hereinafter the “Arbitration Rules”), appointed the Honorable Mare Lalonde, a
Canadian citizen, as arbitrator. On August 5, 2004, the Respondent appointed Professor
Catherine Kessedjian, a French citizen, as arbitrator. As the Parties did not agree on the name
of a President, the Claimants invoked Article 38 of the Convention in order that the Chairman
of the Administrative Council appoint the President of the Arbitral Tribunal. Pursuant to
Article 4(4) of the Arbitration Rules, and after consulting with the Parties, the Chairman of the
Administrative Council appointed Dr. Ahmed El-Kosheri, an Egyptian citizen, as President of
the Arbitral Tribunal.

4. The Tribunal was constituted on September 17, 2004 by virtue of Article 6(1) of the
Arbitration Rules. The Secretary General appointed Mrs. Aurelia Antoniettti, legal counsel! to
the ICSID, as Secretary of the Tribunal. Following the departure of Mrs. Antonietti, Mr.
Florian Grisel, legal counsel to the ICSID, was appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal

followed in turn by Mrs. EloYse Obadia, senior legal counsel to the ICSID.

~

23. Pursuant to Article 43(2) of the Arbitration Rules which provides that “{i]f the parties file with
the Secretary-General the full and signed text of their settlement and in writing request the
Tribunal to embody such settlement in an award, the Tribunal may record the settlement in the
form of its award”, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously hereby decides to give effect to the
request of the Parties. Accordingly, the Settlement agreement of April 21, 2005 and the Report
of November 23, 2005, both reproduced below, are embodied in this award and are deemed to

form an integral part thereof:

 

“SETTLEME!

 

Between the unde:
The Democratic Republic of the Congo, represented for the purposes hereof by Tshibangu Kalala, Esq.,
attorney at law, member of the Kinshasa/Gombe and Brussels Bars, acting by virtue of the special
power of attorney granted him by letter of April 9, 2005 from the Minister of Justice and the Keeper of
the Seals in the name of the Congolese government, on the one hand,

hereinafter referred to as “DRC”;

and

Miminco, LLC, an American company, located 9248 Three Oaks Drive, Silver Spring, MD 20901,
United States of America, represented by its General Manager, Mr. John Dormer Tyson,

Mr. John Dormer Tyson, an American citizen, residing at 9248 Three Oaks Drive, Silver Spring, MD
20901, United States of America,

Dr. Hunga Jean Mukendi, an American citizen, residing at 9248 Three Oaks Drive, Silver Spring, MD
20901, United States of America, of the second part,

hereinafter referred to as “Investor”;

 

Where:

1. The Investor is the owner of two diamond-yielding mining concessions in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo: 1) concession no. 222 (Lungu), granted by Ministerial Decree no. 483/95,
and 2) mining concession no. 223 (Kabizwaya), granted by Ministerial Decree no. 484/95. These
two mining concessions, 25 square kilometers each, are located in the Tshikapa Territory, Kasai
Occidental Province

 

p

The Investor has established that since the month of October 2006, the beginning of the civil war
that entailed the downfall of the regime of Marshal Mobutu, on various occasions the two
concessions have been invaded, pillaged and unlawfully operated by the Congolese civil and
military authorities to the great detriment of its legally protected rights and interests.

3. In light of the above facts, the Investor is accusing the DRC before the ICSID of having violated
the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between
States and Nationals of Other States of March 18, 1965 (ICSID Convention) and those of the
bilateral Treaty Concerning the Encouragement and Protection of Investment entered into with the
United States of America on August 3, 1984. In this context, the Investor is claiming payment from

Case 1:14-cv-01987-RC Document 1-1 Filed 11/24/14 Page 15 of 51

the DRC in an amount of 35 million American dollars to compensate the losses sustained.

Following a minutious examination of the elements furnished by the Investor, it appears that certain
of its claims are founded. However, the DRC considers that the claimed amount of 35 million
dollars in damages is highly exaggerated.

In view of the preceding, and above all for the purpose of ensuring the promotion and protection of
foreign investments within its territory, the DRC, together with the Investor, consider it useful to
explore the ways and means that could lead to the conclusion of an amicable settlement agreement
under the control and supervision of the Arbitral Tribunal instituted by the ICSID. The DRC agrees
to an extra-judicial solution for the sole purpose of, on the one hand, avoiding the high financial
cost of the proceeding before the ICSID and, on the other hand, the risk of a severe condemnation
of the State to pay exorbitant amounts to the Investor which shall heavily and unnecessarily burden
the public Treasury.

Consequently, the following was agreed to:

Article 1.
a. The DRC agrees to pay the Investor the sum of USD15,000,000 as compensation for all of the
losses sustained by it due to the acts committed by the Congolese civil and military authorities.
b. The practical terms and conditions for payment of the above amount shall be subsequently

determined by the parties.

Article 2.
The Investor agrees and undertakes to reinvest the above amount in the operation of the Lungu and
Kabizwaya concessions with a view to the creation of jobs, social infrastructures and public
facilities of a social nature and pay the levies and taxes due the Congolese State.

Article 3.
The parties agree that in consideration for the full execution of their reciprocal obligations, they
shall consider themselves to have been totally satisfied and shall have nothing further to claim one
from the other.

Article 4.
In accordance with the provisions of Article 43, paragraph 2 of the ICSID Rules, the parties hereby
request that the Arbitral Tribunal embody this amicable settlement in the award that shall be
rendered.

Article 5.
This settlement agreement shall be effective as from its approval by the Congolese government.
