Correction and Interpretation of Award and Additional Award
Arbitration SCC V2018/098

 

30 July 2021

Arbitral Tribunal:
Mr. Bernardo M. Cremades (President)
Mr. Kaj Hober
Mr. Zachary Douglas QC

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
On 30 June 2021, the Tribunal issued its Award in this arbitration.

On 5 July 2021, the Tribunal notified the Parties that in the coming days, it would
be issuing minor corrections to the Award pursuant to Article 47 of the 2017
Arbitration Rules of the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce (the “SCC Rules”). The Parties were notified that such corrections
would not affect the substantive decisions of the Award.

On 5 July 2021, Claimants sent a letter to the Tribunal requesting that it “provide
explanations as to the basis of the costs awarded to the Respondent” pursuant to
Article 47(1) of the SCC Rules.

On 8 July 2021, the Tribunal sent an email to the Parties in which it clarified that it
perceived Claimants’ 5 July 2021 letter as a request for interpretation pursuant to
Article 47 of the SCC Rules. The Tribunal requested that Respondent provide
comments on Claimants’ request by 13 July 2021.

On 13 July 2021, Respondent provided its comments to Claimants’ 5 July 2021
request for interpretation.

In its 13 July 2021 correspondence, Respondent also submitted a “request for
interpretation and/or correction and/or supplementing the Award.” The Tribunal

d that Claii provide its to Respondent’s request by 16 July
2021.

On 14 July 2021, the Tribunal extended Claimants’ deadline to 19 July 2021 for
providing comments to Respondent’s 13 July 2021 request. In doing so, the
Tribunal also afforded Claimants the opportunity to provide further comments on
their 5 July 2021 request for interpretation.

On 19 July 2021, Claimants sent a letter to the Tribunal and Respondent providing
comments on their 5 July 2021 request for interpretation, as well as Respondent’s
13 July 2021 “request for interpretation and/or correction and/or supplementing the
Award.” In the same letter, Claimants submitted a request for an additional award
pursuant to Article 48 of the SCC Rules.

On 22 July 2021, Respondent presented its comments on Claimants’ 19 July 2021
request for an additional award.

INTERPRETATION

In their 5 July 2021 letter, Claimants request “that the Tribunal provide
explanations as to the basis of the costs awarded to the Respondent.” Specifically,
Claimants seek clarification as to how the Tribunal arrived at its decision on the
allocation of costs despite Claimants having not received a copy of Respondent’s
Statement of Costs for the purpose of submitting comments. Claimants further
requested interpretation on “whether the Tribunal took into account the

Bilaga 2

>

Respondent's disloyal behaviour regarding the advance payments covering the
costs of the arbitration as requested in the Claimants’ email of 24 August 2020.”

In its 13 July 2021 response, Respondent stated that “the statements of costs were
to be submitted simultaneously in accordance with point 7.7 of the POI, and
Respondent submitted its Statement of Costs in accordance with this rule on 23
October 2020 to the Tribunal and the SCC.”

Respondent contends that if Claimants “did not received Respondent's Statement of
Costs in accordance with 7.7 of the POI, they were reasonably expected to
approach the Tribunal on this point and request explanations without delay in
accordance with Article 36 of the SCC Rules.”'

In their 19 July 2021 letter, Claimants contend that “had [they] had the opportunity
to express their views on the subject, they could have informed the Tribunal that,
e.g., the ‘branches of the Polish government, namely the Ministry of Climate and
Environment and General Counsel to the Republic of Poland’ (par. 776 of the
Award) do not incur additional costs with regards to investment arbitrations,” and
that “public officials, including the counsels to Respondent, get paid monthly
salaries regardless of their involvement in any particular proceedings.”

Lastly, Claimants contend that Article 36 of the SCC Rules does not apply to
Claimants’ failure to comment on their lack of receipt of Respondent’s Statement
of Costs because Claimants had no way of knowing that Respondent had submitted
any such statement. Instead, Claimants had assumed that the Respondent had
waived its right to demand reimbursement of costs.

Pursuant to Article 47 of the SCC Rules, “if the Arbitral Tribunal considers the
request justified, it shall make the correction or provide the interpretation within
30 days of receiving the request.” The Tribunal, having considered Claimants’ 5
July 2021 request justified, hereby provides the desired interpretation. In doing so,
the Tribunal notes that it considers Respondent’s 13 July 2021 correspondence as
requests for correction and an additional award, which are addressed below (see
Sections IIJ and IV).

Respondent’s Fees

1. Tribunal’s Interpretation of Cost Allocation Decision

In the Award, dated 30 June 2021, the Tribunal ruled in favour of the Respondent
in all aspects of the merits of this dispute. As noted in paragraph 769 of the Award,
“Concerning the merits, the Claimants’ case ultimately failed in its entirety, as the
Tribunal has dismissed all the claims for violations of the ECT. This is the
fundamental result of this arbitration . . ..”

 

| Article 36 of the SCC Rules states: “A party who, during the arbitration, fails to object without delay to
any failure to comply with the arbitration agreement, these Rules or other rules applicable to the
proceedings, shall be deemed to have waived the right to object to such failure.”

23.

The Award continued, noting in paragraph 770 that “[a]s a result, the Tribunal
concludes that the Claimants should bear a more significant share of the costs and
fees associated with this arbitration than the Respondent.”

Ultimately, as a result of Respondent prevailing on the merits, the Tribunal
concluded in paragraph 771 of the Award “that the Claimants should bear a more
significant share of the costs and fees associated with this arbitration than the
Respondent.”

After determining that the Claimants should bear a more significant share of the
costs and fees associated with this arbitration, the Tribunal was tasked with
determining such a reasonable amount. With respect to fees, considering the finding
that “Claimants” case ultimately failed in its entirety,” the Tribunal determined that
it was appropriate for Claimants to bear their own fees and a portion of
Respondent’s.”

In their case on the merits, Claimants ultimately sought PLN 373,264,471.38, plus
interest.2 This amount did not include requests regarding costs or fees incurred
during the arbitration. This arbitration lasted more than 2 years, with fairly
extensive factual and legal exhibits produced by the Parties concerning complex,
often very technical issues. This also necessitated the submission and analysis of
numerous expert reports.

The Tribunal aimed for an award on fees that reflected one party prevailing entirely
on the merits in a case of this size, while also taking into account all other
appropriate factors, including the failed jurisdictional challenges and relevant party
behaviour.

In its Statement of Costs, Respondent sought reimbursement of PLN 6,61 1,245.73.4
This included PLN 1,296,584.54 attributed to the General Counsel to the Republic
of Poland and PLN 5,314,661.23 attributed to the Ministry of Climate and
Environment. All costs incurred with respect to the retaining of Respondent’s
experts were included in the PLN 5,314,661.23 attributed to the Ministry of Climate
and Environment.° The costs attributed to the General Counsel to the Republic of
Poland consisted of the value of the legal representation provided in the arbitration.

In its Statement of Costs, Respondent contended that “[t]he value of work in the
investment arbitrations is assessed by the General Counsel on hourly-rate basis.
The hourly rate applied by the General Counsel amounts to PLN 300 (approx. 70
EUR).”” Claimants contend in their 19 July 2021 letter that Polish public officials,
including counsel to Respondent, get paid monthly salaries and thus do not incur

additional costs with regards to investment arbitrations, seemingly making the
argument that counsel to Respondent necessarily cannot seek reimbursement of fees
for time spent on the arbitration.

The fact that Polish government lawyers are paid fixed salaries and do not bill the
Respondent in the same manner as a private law firm was a fact both readily
apparent to the Tribunal, as such is the normal operation of government lawyers
generally, and clarified by Respondent, which again noted that the value of the
counsel work “is assessed by the General Counsel on hourly-rate basis.”*

Respondent valued the work of its lawyers at PLN 300 per hour.? The Tribunal
considered this rate exceptionally reasonable in the context of legal representation
in a large-scale investment arbitration.

In its assessment of a proper allocation of fees, the Tribunal was thus presented with
a request of PLN 6,611,245.73, which included legal representation at a rate
determined to be very reasonable by the Tribunal, expert fees amounting to PLN
3,592,503.66, as well as other miscellaneous costs associated with Respondent’s
presentation of its case.'° The Tribunal also took note of the fact that the total
amount requested by Respondent was approximately 61% of the total being
requested by Claimants (i.e., PLN 6,611,245.73 requested by Respondent vs. EUR
2,367,526.50 (approx. PLN 10,857,142.71) requested by Claimants).

In light of this, the Tribunal sought to arrive at a sum appropriate to reflect the
outcome of this arbitration. The Tribunal determined that in a case of this size,
duration and complexity, having prevailed on every element of the merits of the
dispute, it was appropriate and reasonable to award Respondent PLN 1,296,584.50
of the PLN 6,611,245.73 it sought.

In doing so, the Tribunal did not rule that it was appropriate to order that
Respondent be reimbursed for the legal fees incurred by counsel for Respondent
and not for the costs associated with retaining its experts. Instead, as noted in
paragraph 776 of the Award, the Tribunal concluded that awarding Responding the
amount incurred by the General Counsel to the Republic of Poland represented a
fair and reasonable sum considering the outcome of the dispute.

The Tribunal confirms that in arriving at what it deemed a fair allocation of fees
and costs, it properly considered all relevant factors, including the conduct of the
Parties, even though those factors were not explicitly mentioned in the Award. As
the Award noted in its discussion of costs, the Tribunal’s determination of cost
allocation was guided by the outcome of the arbitration, both with respect to
jurisdiction and the merits.'' No discussion of a Party’s conduct was provided for

in the Award because the Tribunal did not consider that, in all the circumstances,
these factors were critical to the allocation of costs in this case.

2. Respondent’s Statement of Costs

On 15 July 2020, the Tribunal requested that the Parties submit their Statements of
Costs “by Friday 23 October.”

On 23 October 2020, Claimants submitted their Statement of Costs directly to
Respondent, the Tribunal and the SCC.

Also on 23 October 2020, Respondent submitted its Statement of Costs.
Respondent’s Statement of Costs was sent only to the Tribunal and the SCC, as
Respondent determined that the cost submissions were “simultaneous submissions”
guided by paragraph 7.7 of Procedural Order No. 1, which provides for such
submissions to be sent only to the Tribunal and the SCC.

The Tribunal acknowledges that at the time of receiving the Parties’ cost statements,
it failed to note the discrepancy in how each Party submitted their respective
statement (i.e., that Claimants had copied Respondent, but Respondent had not
copied Claimants).

The Tribunal confirms that Respondent submitted its Statement of Costs in a timely
fashion (i.e., on the 23 October 2020 deadline). The Tribunal also confirms that
between 23 October 2020 and 5 July 2021, Claimants made no mention of the fact
that they did not receive any Statement of Costs from Respondent (Article 36 of the
SCC Rules). The Tribunal further confirms that the Parties in this arbitration did
not enter into any agreement whereby each side was to be afforded an opportunity
to comment on the other side’s requests for costs.

CORRECTIONS

On 5 July 2021, the Tribunal emailed the Parties and noted that “in the coming days,
the Tribunal will issue a Correction to the Award pursuant to Article 47 of the SCC
Rules to address some minor, formal matters. None of the corrections are
substantive and thus will not alter the decisions of the Tribunal.”

Before the Tribunal issued such corrections, Respondent submitted its 13 July
“request for interpretation and/or correction and/or supplementing the Award.”
While the Respondent’s “requests” are not properly labelled as falling under
interpretation, correction or supplementation, in reviewing Respondent's 13 July
email, the Tribunal understands it to constitute requests for corrections and an
additional award pursuant to Articles 47 and 48 of the SCC Rules (See Section IV).

Respondent's first request concerns specification in the operative part of the award
the amount owed to Respondent as a result of the Tribunal’s ruling that that
Claimants are to bear all costs of the arbitration. Specifically, Respondent contends
that because Respondent paid PLN 1,548,422.21 as its half of the Advance on

Bilaga 2

38.

39.

40.

Al.

42.

43.

44.

45.

Costs, and the Tribunal ruled that Claimants are to bear all costs of the arbitration,
that the Tribunal should specify in the operative part of the Award that Claimants
are ordered to hereby pay Respondent PLN 1,548,422.21 to reimburse it for its share
of the Advance on Costs.

The Tribunal finds the request that the amount of reimbursement be specified in the
operative part of the Award to be reasonable as it does not alter any aspect of the
Award but merely provides clarification. However, after consultation with the SCC,
the Tribunal does not find the amount noted by Respondent to be the amount
applicable, nor does not find it appropriate to order that such payment be made in
PLN.

Respondent noted in its 13 July 2021 correspondence that its half of the Advance
on Costs was PLN 1,548,422.21 (an equivalent of EUR 355,159). While
Respondent is correct in that its half of the Advance of Costs amounted to EUR
355,159, Respondent is set to receive EUR 14,185.25 from the SCC following the
settlement of account. This amount represents what will be half of the remaining
Advance on Costs. Therefore, Respondent would need to be reimbursed EUR
340,973.75 to cover the entirety of the Advance on Costs paid.

With respect to the proper currency, the SCC has confirmed that, despite
Respondent's contention in its 13 July 2021 email, its share of the Advance on Costs
was paid in EUR, not PLN. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to order
such reimbursement be paid in EUR.

Next, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal specify in the operative part of the
Award that the Claimants are jointly and severally liable to reimburse Respondent
for the portion of fees ordered by the Tribunal (i.e, PLN 1,296,584.50). The
Respondent notes that the Tribunal made such a specification in paragraph 771 of
the Award with respect to the costs of the arbitration but failed to do so with respect
to legal fees.

The Tribunal acknowledges that this language should have been applied to both the
costs of arbitration and the reimbursement of Respondent's fees, and not only to the
costs of arbitration.

Next, Respondent requests that the Tribunal correct the list of Respondent’s legal
team as contained in paragraph 20 of the Award by adding two additional names
that were inadvertently omitted from the Award. The Tribunal finds this correction
appropriate.

Lastly, the Respondent notes the inadvertent use of “emergency” in paragraphs 19
and 20 of the Award. The Tribunal confirms that before receiving Respondent’s 13
July 2021 request, it had noticed these typos and had planned to address them.
Accordingly, the Tribunal finds this request reasonable.

Pursuant to Article 47 of the SCC Rules, the following corrections are hereby
ordered. It should be noted that such corrections consist of those requested and

accepted by Respondent, as well as necessary corrections noted and now applied
by the Tribunal.

The Title on the cover page of the Award shall now read: “IN THE MATTER OF

application should be filed with Stockholm District Court within three months from
the date when the party received this award.”

On the signature page on page 149, “Place of arbitration” shall now read “Seat of

ADDITIONAL AWARD
Both Parties have made requests for an additional award.

Claimants’ Request

In their letter of 19 July 2021, the Claimants request that the Tribunal render an
additional award deciding on the Claimants’ motion provided for in their email of
24 August 2020.

The motion that Claimants refer to concerns a request that Respondent be required
to reimburse Claimants for 50% of the costs incurred in organizing the hearing,
which Claimants communicated as USD 63,022.99. The Tribunal notes that in its
Statement of Costs, Claimants contended that this amount should be considered as
“Costs of Arbitration.”!? In this respect, the Award ruled that Claimants should bear
all of the costs of this arbitration.'?

In their communications of 13 July 2021 and 22 July 2021, Respondent contends
that the costs of organizing the hearing should be considered costs incurred by a
party (Article 50 of the SCC Rules) as opposed to costs of the arbitration (Article
49 of the SCC Rules). Respondent highlights that the Award concluded that
Claimants should bear all of the costs of the arbitration and partially the costs
incurred by Respondent.'4 Respondent also contends that the Tribunal already
decided that the costs incurred by Claimants are borne by Claimants themselves.

The Tribunal does not consider the hearing costs as a separate issue that needs to
be ruled upon independently of the other costs and fees incurred in this arbitration.
The Tribunal did not provide a breakdown in the Award of the various costs
incurred in this arbitration, including costs of organizing the hearing, because such
a breakdown was unnecessary to articulate the allocation determined by the
Tribunal. The Parties disagree as to the proper characterization of the costs of
organizing the hearing, but such a disagreement is inconsequential here, as the
Tribunal has determined the amounts owed to Respondent within the Tribunal’s
rulings on costs and fees. Further, to the extent that Claimants’ request for

Bilaga 2

reimbursement for the costs of the organization of the hearing could be considered
a separate claim, which the Tribunal disagrees with for the reasons stated above,
paragraphs 778.2 and 778.3 of the Award make clear that such claims were denied.

61. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects Claimants’ 19 July 2021 request for an additional
award.

b&

Respondent’s Request

62. In its correspondence of 13 July 2021, Respondent “respectfully requests that the
Arbitral Tribunal correct the Award by making the record of the amount paid by
the Ministry of Climate and Environment for the Advance on Costs in the amount
of 1 548 422,21 PLN and interpret/correct the Award or make an additional award
to the effect that in Section VIII of the Award Claimants are ordered to jointly and
severally pay the amount of 1 548 422,21 PLN to the Republic of Poland
represented by the Ministry of Climate and Environment with 5% interest per
annum accruing from the date of this award.”

63. The Award ruled that Claimants should bear all of the costs of this arbitration.'°
The Award also noted that both Parties had requested that any amount awarded in
this arbitration be subject to interest.’

64. While the Award explicitly noted that interest would accrue on the amount
Claimants were ordered to pay Respondent to reimburse Respondent for certain
legal fees incurred, it failed to address Respondent’s request that such interest
should also accrue for the amount Claimants were ordered to pay Respondent for
costs of the arbitration.

65. Because the Award ultimately did not address Respondent’s request that interest
apply to the ordered reimbursement of costs of the arbitration, the Tribunal
interprets Respondent’s request as one for an additional award pursuant to Article
48 of the SCC Rules.

66. As both Parties requested that any amount awarded in this arbitration be subject to
interest, the Tribunal determines that subjecting this ordered payment to interest is
appropriate.

67. For the reasons stated above, the Arbitral Tribunal:

67.1. ORDERS that the EUR 340,973.75 Claimants have been ordered to pay
Respondent to reimburse Respondent for 50% of the costs of the arbitration
be subject to 5% interest per annum accruing from the date of this additional
award. Claimants are jointly and severally liable to pay such costs.

SCC ARBITRATION V 2018/098

RESPONDENT’S STATEMENT OF COSTS

23 OCTOBER 2020

In accordance with the Tribunal’s request contained in an e-mail communication of 15

October 2020, Respondent hereby submits its Statement of Costs.

Respondent upholds its hitherto position as expressed in its written submissions ((i para
727 of SoD; (ii) para 735(3) of Rejoinder and (iii) para 92(3) of Respondent’s Post-
Hearing Brief). Consequently, Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to order
Claimants to pay Respondent the costs of these arbitration proceedings, fixed in
accordance with Articles 49 and 50 of the 2017 SCC Arbitration Rules, i.e. including the
Costs of the Arbitration incurred by Respondent, as well as the fees and expenses relating
to Respondent’s legal representation, in-house costs, fees and expenses of any expert
appointed by Respondent or Tribunal, and all other reasonable costs, with interest from
the date of the award to the date of payment. For avoidance of any doubt, Respondent
respectfully requests that the Tribunal burden Claimants with (i) the entire Costs of the
Arbitration (in accordance with Article 49 of the 2017 SCC Arbitration Rules) and (ii)
with the entire costs incurred by the Parties in this arbitration (in accordance with Article
50 of the 2017 SCC Arbitration Rules).

Respondent made all the payments in PLN, even if the invoices were issued in different
currencies (EUR, USD or GBP). Thus, the reimbursement should be made also in PLN.

Respondent’s legal representation in the said proceedings was based on the services
provided by the counsels of the Office of the General Counsel to the Republic of Poland
(“General Counsel” or “General Counsel to the Republic of Poland”). The value of
work in the investment arbitrations is assessed by the General Counsel on hourly-rate
basis. The hourly rate applied by the General Counsel amounts to PLN 300 (approx. 70
EUR).

Respondent submits that a part of the costs, as expressly indicated in the table below, are
attributable to the Republic of Poland represented by the Ministry of Climate and
Environment and the other part of the costs is attributable to the Republic of Poland
represented by the General Counsel to the Republic of Poland. The above results
from the separation of those state authorities under Polish law and for the state budgetary

purposes.

Respondent also notes that the costs incurred by the Republic of Poland represented by
the Ministry of Climate and Environment may increase, infer alia, due to the Tribunal’s

works on the preparation of the final award. Of course, also such additional costs should

2

Bilaga 2

Bilaga 2

be reimbursed by Claimants to the Republic of Poland represented by the Ministry of

Climate and Environment.

7. For the above reasons, Respondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to expressly order,

in accordance with the below table, that (i) the first relevant part of the costs be paid by

Claimants in favour of the Republic of Poland represented by the Ministry of Climate

and Environment and (ii) the other relevant part in favour of the Republic of Poland

represented by the General Counsel to the Republic of Poland.
