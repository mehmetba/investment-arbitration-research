PETITIONERS’ MEMORANDUM IN SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO VACATE ARBITRATION AWARD

INTRODUCTION

Petitioners Tembec Inc., Tembec Investments Inc., and Tembec Industries
Inc. (collectively “Tembec”) move this Court, pursuant to the Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Arbitral Awards (“New York Convention”), 9 U.S.C.
§201, and Section 10 of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 10, to vacate the
September 7, 2005 Order of the Consolidation Tribunal (“Award”) rendered by a tribunal
constituted under Article 1126 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA’).

Tembec is a Canadian lumber, pulp and paper producing company,
organized under the laws of Québec, Canada, with significant investments in the United
States. On December 3, 2003, Tembec instituted an arbitration seeking damages from
the United States under NAFTA Article 1120, which provides protections for foreign

investors in the United States. The arbitration seeks more than $200 million in

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 5 of 45

damages for the continued imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties on
softwood lumber that on appeal has been held unlawful.

By March 7, 2005, an Article 1120 tribunal had been formed expressly to
arbitrate Tembec’s claims; a hearing on organizational matters and discovery had been
held; jurisdictional objections raised by the United States had been pleaded and briefed;
a jurisdictional hearing had been scheduled. After almost a year and a half of delaying
the proceedings, the United States on March 7 sought new arbitrators, petitioning the
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) to appoint a
new tribunal under NAFTA Article 1126 (“Consolidation Tribunal”) to consolidate
Tembec’s NAFTA Chapter 11 claims with claims submitted by Canfor Corporation
(“Canfor”) in November 2001, and by Terminal Forest Products Limited (“Terminal”)
(collectively “Claimants”) in March 2004.' The United States’ petition, which could have
been filed fifteen months earlier (with Canfor’s suit long outstanding before Tembec
filed), effectively postponed jurisdictional decisions on motions of the United States from
two consensually formed tribunals, in favor of a new tribunal chosen in part from a U.S.
government list with no comparable input from Claimants.

On May 6, 2005, the ICSID Secretary-General appointed three arbitrators
to the new Consolidation Tribunal sought by the United States.” One of the arbitrators
was an American who had been appointed by the United States to the ICSID Panel of
Arbitrators--a group of arbitrators chosen by governments (who are only and always
respondents) to hear state-investor disputes. The chairman was Dutch, named to the

ICSID Panel of Arbitrators by the Government of The Netherlands. The third arbitrator
was a Canadian appointed at the discretion of the Secretary-General.° Tembec was not
asked to provide a proposed list of arbitrators from which members of the Consolidation
Tribunal could be selected.

None of the arbitrators disclosed information of “any circumstances likely
to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or independence,” as required by
UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration (“UNCITRAL”), Article 9, the governing procedural rules
under NAFTA Article 1126.4 Through due diligence, Tembec learned that the American
arbitrator, Davis R. Robinson, was a family relation of the President of the United
States. The President has been involved personally in the Softwood Lumber dispute
with Canada that led to Tembec’s claims. Mr. Robinson was also former Legal Adviser
to the Department of State, the very office that defends investment disputes generally
and is defending the United States in this case in particular.

Quickly after these disclosures, and before the expiration of the fifteen
days for challenging the appointment of arbitrators provided by Article 11 of the
UNCITRAL Rules, the Consolidation Tribunal issued an order suspending the ongoing
Article 1120 arbitration proceedings, which effectively canceled Tembec’s jurisdictional
hearing.° The hearing was to have completed a protracted process instigated by the
United States that had delayed getting to the merits of Tembec’s claims. Tembec

promptly objected to Mr. Robinson's appointment, to the premature suspension of its

Article 1120 proceedings, and to the untimely petition for consolidation. |CSID and the
Tribunal overruled all of Tembec’s objections.

On September 7, 2005, the Consolidation Tribunal granted the United
States’ request to consolidate Tembec’s NAFTA Chapter 11 claims with the other
Claimants, and definitively terminated Tembec’s suspended arbitration proceedings
before the Article 1120 Tribunal (‘Award”).® Tembec timely filed a petition to vacate the
Consolidation Tribunal’s Award, and notified the United States of its intent to file this
Motion to Vacate.

Tembec now requests that this Court vacate the Award on the grounds
that: (1) Mr. Robinson’s appointment to the Consolidation Tribunal presented conflicts of
interest, creating “evident partiality” on the tribunal against Tembec; (2) the composition
of the Consolidation Tribunal violated NAFTA Article 1126 and U.S. public policy, as the
United States and respondent governments had undue influence over the choice of the
tribunal; and (3) the Consolidation Tribunal exceeded its powers because it exercised
authority without being properly constituted and beyond the authority granted by NAFTA
Article 1126. As a result, the Award should be void.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

The NAFTA Parties — the Governments of Canada, Mexico, and the

United States — promulgated Chapter 11 of NAFTA to “ensure a predictable commercial

97

framework for business planning and investment” and to “increase substantially

investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties.”®

They codified international
legal standards to protect foreign investments from discriminatory and arbitrary
government measures. For example, the NAFTA Parties are required to provide
“national treatment” and “most-favored-nation treatment” to NAFTA investors and their
foreign investments.° They also must provide “the minimum standard of treatment in
accordance with international law” to foreign investments, and refrain from expropriating
foreign investments without providing fair compensation.'°

The NAFTA Parties gave investors the means to protect their foreign
investments from violations of these and other standards by waiving sovereign immunity
and consenting to foreign investors’ submission of arbitration claims for damages."" In
the case of Article 1126 proceedings, NAFTA Chapter 11 and the UNCITRAL Rules of
Arbitration serve as the “arbitration agreement.” See NAFTA Article 1126(1).

The United States Department of Commerce and the United States
International Trade Commission, acting upon petitions filed by U.S. lumber
manufacturers, initiated antidumping and countervailing duty investigations of softwood
lumber imported from Canada on April 2, 2001. The two agencies both made
affirmative determinations to impose duties, and on May 22, 2002, the Department of
Commerce issued antidumping and countervailing duty orders requiring Tembec to pay

29% ad valorem duties, in the form of cash deposits, on lumber destined for the U.S.

market. The United States has collected an estimated US$4 billion in softwood lumber
cash deposits from Canadian exporters. Tembec has paid already over US$200
million to the United States under these orders. Duty deposits continue to be collected
on a daily basis.

Tembec and other Canadian parties appealed the administrative
determinations authorizing the imposition of antidumping and countervailing duties.
NAFTA Chapter 19 permits binational panels of U.S. and Canadian international trade
experts to “stand in the shoes” of the United States Court of International Trade and the
United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, and review the administrative
determinations to determine whether they comply with U.S. law. A NAFTA Chapter 19
binational panel reviewing the International Trade Commission’s affirmative threat of
injury determination found the determination to be unlawful and required the
Commission to reverse it.

The legal result of the binational panel decision and consequent negative
determination of the International Trade Commission should have been the revocation
of the duty orders and refund of the cash deposits paid pursuant to them.'? Another
NAFTA Chapter 19 panel independently found that the original 19% ad valorem
countervailing duties calculated by the Department of Commerce in fact should have

been de minimis, meaning less than 1%, which also should require revocation and

refund as to the countervailing duty order.’* The United States, however, has refused to
comply with these decisions.

The Softwood Lumber dispute has engaged the leaders of both countries.
In late November 2004, President Bush personally told Canada’s then Prime Minister,
Paul Martin, that the problem in the Softwood Lumber dispute was Canada’s despite the
many contrary rulings. Senator Michael Crapo of Idaho explained on the Senate floor:

The Bush Administration has concluded that duty deposits
amounting to approximately $3 billion and growing daily
cannot and will not be returned absent a negotiated
settlement between the Canadian and U.S. Governments.

.. There is zero likelihood that the countervailing duty
antisubsidy order will disappear absent settlement of the
lumber subsidy and dumping issues, no matter how often a
NAFTA panel tries to achieve this outcome.'®

At least three cabinet officials have been involved framing, defending, or
explaining U.S. policy, all as rebuttal to the judicial decisions of NAFTA panels.
The Commerce Secretary and the U.S. Trade Representative (who is in the
Executive Office of the President) personally have spent considerable time on
the issue."© At a joint press conference in Ottawa with Canada’s Foreign Affairs
Minister, Pierre Pettigrew, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice urged

*® 451 Cong. Rec. $136-7 (daily ed. Jan. 24, 2005) (statement of Sen. Crapo) attached at Appendix Tab

(D-MT) stated that the United States Government would not live up to its legal obligations under NAFTA.

coalition, including — | personally, while it was a commerce decision, suggested the critical circumstances
finding which was important along the way, was the one that was appropriate. And so we now do have
the preliminary countervailing duty and anti-dumping duties.”) Ambassador Zoellick thus adopted and
pursued a position contrary to Tembec’s interests without the results of agency investigations.

Canadians “not to speak in apocalyptic language about this issue” and that “[t]he
word of the United States has been good as gold in international dealings and
agreements.""” Yet, litigation to enforce the panel decisions continues, the
United States has not revoked the antidumping and countervailing duty orders,
no refunds have been given, and Tembec continues to pay duty deposits.

Tembec submitted claims for arbitration against the United States on
December 3, 2003 for violations of its NAFTA Chapter 11 obligations with respect to
Tembec and Tembec’s U.S. investments. Tembec alleges that the United States has
manipulated its antidumping and countervailing duty laws so they were applied to
Tembec and its investments in an arbitrary, unfair, and discriminatory manner in
violation of Articles 1102, 1103, 1105, and 1110 of NAFTA."8

Tembec appointed to its original Article 1120 tribunal Professor James
Crawford of Australia. The United States appointed Professor Kenneth Dam of the
United States of America, and ICSID appointed Judge Florentino Feliciano of the
Philippines, with the consent of both the United States and Tembec. Neither Tembec
nor the United States had any objections as to any of the Article 1120 tribunal members
nor to the formation of the tribunal. The first meeting with the Article 1120 tribunal was
convened by telephone on November 30, 2004, and the parties began submitting briefs

addressing U.S. challenges to jurisdiction in February 2005.

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 12 of 45

On March 7, 2005, as briefing was almost complete, the United States
requested ICSID to appoint a new tribunal under NAFTA Article 1126 to consolidate the
NAFTA Chapter 11 claims of Tembec, Canfor, and Terminal.'® Canfor had filed its
statement of claim in November 2001 and Terminal filed a notice of arbitration in March
2004.2° Canfor had already completed a jurisdictional hearing and was awaiting a
decision; Terminal had shown no interest in pursuing its claim.2’ The United States,
thus, knew by December 2003 that it was facing more than one investor claim from
Canadian lumber producers.

Tembec, Canfor, and the Canfor tribunal all questioned the United States
about consolidation, Tembec inquiring as early as January 2004. Counsel for the
United States told the Canfor tribunal, “I can assure you that we have given
[consolidation] considerable thought, that we have no intention of invoking Article 1126
in this proceeding.” The United States participated in the separate tribunals until both
were nearly finished addressing jurisdictional challenges raised by the United States.
Only then, after developing a substantial acquaintance with both tribunals, did the

United States move to dispose of both of them.

?3 The United States’ appointee to the Canfor tribunal, Conrad Harper, resigned on March 2, 2005 after
being questioned by Canfor about an undisclosed conflict. The United States refused to make a timely
appointment to replace Mr. Harper. The United States used his recusal as pretext to dispose of the two
tribunals.

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 13 of 45

Without addressing such obvious issues as timing, forum shopping, and
due process, ICSID named Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg of The Netherlands, Mr. Davis
R. Robinson of the United States, and Mr. L. Yves Fortier of Canada as arbitrators to
decide whether, on the United States’ motion, the other tribunals should be abolished in
favor of themselves.* The United States objected to the appointment of Mr. Fortier on
the basis that his law firm had been involved with representing Canadian parties in the
United States’ antidumping or countervailing duty proceedings against softwood lumber
from Canada. Mr. Fortier immediately withdrew.° ICSID then appointed Professor
Armand de Mestral of Canada in place of Mr. Fortier.2° Neither Mr. Fortier nor
Professor de Mestral came from a list of arbitrators submitted by the Government of
Canada or a list submitted by any of the Canadian parties, unlike the selection of Mr.
Robinson, whose name was chosen by ICSID from a list of four arbitrators appointed by
the President of the United States.””

Upon being named, Mr. Robinson did not disclose any relationship to
President George W. Bush. During its due diligence, Tembec found a family tree on the
Internet that indicated a person bearing the name “Davis Robinson” was a member of
the Bush family. Tembec wrote to ICSID on May 2, 2005 to inquire whether Mr.
Robinson was related to President Bush, and the nature of any relationship, so Tembec

could determine whether to challenge Mr. Robinson’s appointment as giving rise to

2? The United States, as a party to the ICSID Convention, appoints four arbitrators to the ICSID list of
arbitrators for a term of six years. Canada, who has not signed the ICSID Convention, is not entitled to
appoint any arbitrators to the standing list maintained by ICSID. See Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention’), art. 3.

“justifiable doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence” under Article 10 of
the UNCITRAL Rules.”®
ICSID responded in a letter on Friday, May 6, 2005, stating:
| am pleased to confirm that Dr. Albert Jan van den Berg, Professor
Armand de Mestral and Mr. Davis R. Robinson have accepted their
appointments as presiding arbitrator and co arbitrators,
respectively, in the Consolidation Tribunal that will decide the
United States’ Request for Consolidation under NAFTA Article 1126
of March 7, 2005.

Attached please find a copy of a statement that we have received
today from Mr. Robinson with his acceptance.

The Consolidation Tribunal is accordingly deemed to be
established on this date.”°

Submitted contemporaneously with that letter was Mr. Robinson’s response to the
inquiry about his family relations. He revealed for the first time that he is married to
Suzanne Walker, a first cousin (once removed) of the President of the United States,
George Walker Bush.°°

Immediately after the intervening weekend, on Monday, May 9, 2005, the
United States requested that the Consolidation Tribunal issue an order to stay
Tembec’s Article 1120 arbitration proceedings in light of the immediate need, in its view,
to prevent a June 2-3, 2005 hearing on jurisdiction scheduled by Tembec’s Article 1120
Tribunal.*' Tembec opposed the United States’ request on that same day, pointing out

that a stay would be premature because Tembec had not been allowed the 15 days

Robinson’s May 6 letter.>2 The United States responded by urging the Consolidation
Tribunal to nonetheless stay Tembec’s Article 1120 arbitration proceedings before a
challenge to the tribunal’s proper formation and authority could be heard.°> The United
States indicated none of the concern about familial relations manifested when
questioning one of the Canfor arbitrators.**

Counsel to Canfor provided a letter to the parties on May 10, 2005 to
disclose another potential, undisclosed conflict of interest.°> Canfor advised that
Professor Armand de Mestral was of counsel to a law firm pursuing another NAFTA
Chapter 11 claim against the United States, and that one of the co-counsel in Canfor
also was acting as co-counsel with Professor de Mestral’s firm in the other case.

On May 19, 2005, fewer than fifteen days after information had been
disclosed regarding potential conflicts of interest for two of the three named
arbitrators—Mr. Davis R. Robinson and Prof. Armand de Mestral—the Consolidation

Tribunal ordered a stay of Tembec’s Article 1120 proceedings pending the decision to

Tembec submitted a timely objection to Mr. Robinson’s participation on
May 20, 2005, and requested the Tribunal to stay its own proceedings pending the

Meanwhile, Tembec continued its challenge of Mr. Robinson to the Secretary-General
of ICSID on June 9, 2005, pursuant to UNCITRAL Article 11(3).42 The Consolidation
Tribunal proceeded as though it had obtained full consent and authorization from the
parties, requiring written submissions regarding consolidation, and ordering the parties
to appear at a hearing on consolidation on June 16, 2005.*° ICSID’s decision not to
compel Mr. Robinson’s withdrawal came on the morning of the first hearing with the
Consolidation Tribunal, just thirty minutes before the hearing was scheduled to begin.4
ARGUMENT

The Consolidation Tribunal’s decision to terminate Tembec’s Article 1120
tribunal should be vacated on three well-established grounds for setting aside arbitration
awards: “evident partiality;” violation of the arbitration agreement and U.S. public policy;
and the tribunal having exceeded its powers.
I. STANDARD OF REVIEW

NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration has a short history consisting of relatively
few arbitrations. It is, however, a form of international commercial arbitration derived
from well-known principles developed in U.S. federal courts. The Supreme Court has

established that “arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to

2005, just before the Consolidation hearing was scheduled to begin at 10:00 a.m.).

submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed so to submit.” AT&T
Technologies Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, 475 U.S. 643, 648 (1986).
“Unless the parties clearly and unmistakably provide otherwise, the question of whether
the parties agreed to arbitrate is to be decided by the court, not the arbitrator.” /d. at
649. The arbitration agreement at issue here is NAFTA Chapter 11 and the UNCITRAL
Rules of Arbitration which, according to Article 1126(1), govern the establishment and
conduct of the Consolidation Tribunal.

Arbitration awards from NAFTA Chapter 11 tribunals are “not considered a
domestic award” and are, therefore, subject to the Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards. See New York Convention Article I(1) and
NAFTA Article 1136(7)(“A claim that is submitted to arbitration under this Section shall
be considered to arise out of a commercial relationship or transaction for purposes of
Article | of the New York Convention....”).

The situs of the Consolidation Tribunal’s proceedings was ICSID
headquarters in Washington D.C., but the arbitration was governed by international law.
See NAFTA Article 1131(1). Because the Award was made in the United States, this
Court must apply domestic law, under Chapter 1 of the FAA, to vacate the award. See
Jacada (Europe) Ltd. v. Int'l Marketing Strategies, 401 F.3d 701, 709 (6" Cir. 2005).*®

Chapter 1 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. 1 et seq. sets forth three
relevant grounds for setting aside an arbitration award. Section 10, 9 U.S.C. §10,

provides:

“© The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §203 and 28 U.S.C. §1331, because
Chapter 11 of NAFTA is the arbitration agreement at issue.

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 19 of 45

(a) In any of the following cases, the United States court
in and for the district wherein the award“° was made
may make an order vacating the award upon
application of any party to the arbitration-

(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption
in the arbitrators, or either of them.

(3) | Where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct
... or any other behavior by which the rights of
the party have been prejudiced.

(4) | Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,
or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,
final, and definite award upon the subject
matter submitted was not made.

The courts also have established non-statutory grounds to vacate an award. Relevant
to this case, courts will vacate an award that is contrary to public policy or where the
arbitral tribunal lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because it was not within the

agreement to arbitrate.

“© Courts have construed “award” in the FAA to mean a decision by an arbitrator or tribunal that is final
and definite. Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Employees. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 777 F.2d 751, 755 (D.C. Cir.
1985). An arbitral decision need not, however, resolve every issue between the parties to be considered
a final award for review under the FAA. Publicis Commce’n v. True N. Commce’ns Inc., 206 F.3d 725 (7th
Cir. 2000); Metallgeselischaft A.G. v. M/V Capitan Constante, 790 F.2d 280 (2d Cir. 1986); Hart Surgical
Inc. v. Ultracision, Inc., 244 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 2001). Courts will review a decision that is
independent of and unrelated to the merits of a continuing arbitration, particularly where the relief sought
through judicial review under the FAA would be rendered meaningless by delaying until the issuance of a
final arbitral award on the merits. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Expresstrak, L.L.C., 2003 U.S. Dist.
LEXIS 24486 at *7-8 (D.D.C. May 1, 2003) (preliminary order preventing Amtrak from ceasing to perform

F.2d 1019 (9th Cir. 1991)( “interim final order” requiring a party to set aside funds in an escrow account);

criteria.

I. THE COMPOSITION OF THE CONSOLIDATION TRIBUNAL UNFAIRLY
FAVORED THE UNITED STATES

A. Mr. Robinson Has A Relationship To The United States That Demonstrates
“Evident Partiality” Sufficient To Vacate The Award

1. The Court May Vacate For Evident Partiality Demonstrated By An
Arbitrator’s Partial Relationship With A Party To The Arbitration

The arbitration agreement required the tribunal to consist of “independent
and impartial” arbitrators. See NAFTA Article 1126(1), incorporating UNCITRAL Rules
of Arbitration, Arts. 6(4). The appointment of Davis R. Robinson gave rise to “evident
partiality” on the tribunal, violating FAA §10(a)(2) and the arbitration agreement.4”

The federal courts have interpreted the Supreme Court's decision, in
Commonwealth Coatings Corp. v. Continental Casualty Co., 393 U.S. 145 (1968), to
require more than an appearance but less than actual proof of bias to satisfy the
“evident partiality” standard in Section 10(a)(2) of the FAA.*® The Court should find
evident partiality where “a ‘reasonable person would have to conclude that an arbitrator
was partial’ to the other party to the arbitration.“° The party seeking vacatur must offer

specific facts “that demonstrate objectively a degree of partiality such that a reasonable

person could assume an arbitrator had improper motives.”©°

479 U.S.C. §10(a)(2).

“8 See, e.g., Overseas Private Investment Corp. v. Anaconda Co., 418 F.Supp. 107, 110-11 (D.C. Cir.
1976) (concluding that Commonwealth Coatings created an "irrebuttable presumption" of bias where
arbitrator knows of conflicting relationship and fails to disclose); Morelite Constr. Corp. v. New York City
Dist. Council Carpenters Benefit Funds, 748 F.2d 79, 84 (2d Cir. 1984). In Commonwealth Coatings
Corp., 393 U.S. 145, Justice Black declared for a plurality of the Supreme Court that arbitrators “not only
must be unbiased but must avoid even the appearance of bias.” 393 U.S. at 150. Justices White and
Marshall concurred in the result.

48 Al-Harbi v. Citibank, 1995 U.S. Dist. Lexis 22158, at 6 (D.D.C. July 18, 1995) (citing People’s Sec. Life
Ins. Co. v. Monumental Life Ins. Co., 991 F.2d 141, 146 (4th Cir. 1993)) aff'd by Al-Harbi v. Citibank, 85
F.3d 680 (DC Cir. 1996). See also Morelite Constr. Corp., 748 F.2d at 84; Montez v. Prudential Securities
Inc., 260 F.3d 980, 983 (8th Cir. 2001).

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 21 of 45

A petitioner need not demonstrate actual bias in the proceedings or the
merits of an award where there is evidence of a partial relationship between the
arbitrator and one of the parties. In Commonwealth Coatings, the Supreme Court
vacated an arbitration award for “evident partiality” based on one arbitrator's
undisclosed business relationships with one of the arbitration parties, even though the
petitioner “does not charge before us that the third arbitrator was actually guilty of fraud
or bias in deciding this case, and we have no reason, apart from the undisclosed
business relationship, to suspect him of any improper motives.” 393 U.S. at 147.

Similarly, the Second Circuit, in Morelite Constr. Corp., 748 F.2d 79,
vacated an arbitration award where the arbitrator and an officer of the union
participating in the arbitration had a father-son relationship. The Second Circuit did not
know any other facts about the relationship between the two men, but based its decision
on the “strong feeling that sons are more often than not loyal to their fathers, partial to
their fathers, and biased on behalf of their fathers.” /d.

An arbitrator's failure to disclose information about his relationship to one
of the arbitration parties may also be considered as evidence of partiality. See
Commonwealth Coatings, 393 U.S. at 148; see also Gianelli Money Purchase Plan and
Trust v. ADM Investor Services, Inc., 146 F.3d 1309, 1312-13 (11th Cir. 1998) ("[A]n
arbitration award may be vacated due to the ‘evident partiality’ of an arbitrator ... when
... the arbitrator knows of, but fails to disclose, information which would lead a
reasonable person to believe that a potential conflict exists." (citations omitted)); See
Delta Mine Holding Co. v. AFC Coal Props., Inc., 280 F.3d 815, 821-22 (8th Cir. 2002)

("When a neutral arbitrator fails to disclose a relationship with one party that casts

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 22 of 45

significant doubt on the arbitrator's impartiality, as in Commonwealth Coatings, it is
appropriate to assume that the concealed partiality prejudicially tainted the award.");
Schmitz v. Zilveti, 20 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir. 1994).

In Olson v. Merrill Lynch, 51 F.3d 157 (8th Cir. 1995), the Eighth Circuit
vacated an award because one of the arbitrators failed to disclose his high ranking
position in his company and the fact that his company conducted a significant amount of
business with Merrill Lynch. There was no direct relationship between the arbitrator and
Merrill Lynch. The court vacated the award, without any finding of actual bias in the
conduct of the proceedings or on the merits of the award, because the arbitrator's
failure to disclose denied the parties an opportunity to accept or reject the arbitrator with
full knowledge of the arbitrator's connections.

A finding of evident partiality of just one member of a tribunal explicitly
merits vacatur of the award under Section 10, which specifies the partiality of the
arbitrators “or either of them.” See Commonwealth Coatings 393 U.S. at 150-51 (1968)
(setting aside a unanimous arbitral award because one arbitrator failed to disclose prior
business relationships with a party to the dispute); Amos Treat & Co. v. SEC, 306 F.2d
260, 264 (D.C. Cir. 1962) (quoting Berkshire Employees Ass'n, Etc. v. National Labor R.
Bd., 121 F.2d 235, 238-239 (3d Cir. 1941)(“Litigants are entitled to an impartial tribunal
whether it consists of one man or twenty and there is no way which we know of whereby
the influence of one upon the others can be quantitatively measured.”).°"

5" See also Schmitz, 20 F.3d at 1049 (vacating a unanimous arbitration award by a National Association
of Securities Dealers panel due to evident partiality of one arbitrator); University Commons-Urbana, Ltd.
v. Universal Constructors Inc., 304 F.3d 1331, 1339-43 (11th Cir. 2002) (remanding for evidentiary

hearing to determine whether one arbitrator was evidently partial and providing a basis to set aside a
unanimous arbitration award).

2. Mr. Robinson’s Relationships To The United States Demonstrate
Evident Partiality

Mr. Robinson’s familial relationship to the President of the United States
(undisclosed until questioned); his political and financial support for the President (not
disclosed at all); his former position as the Legal Adviser to the U.S. State Department
(the office defending the claim); and his appointment to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators
by the President (also undisclosed); all demonstrate a relationship that compromises
Mr. Robinson’s impartiality in Tembec’s suit against the United States.

Mr. Robinson’s familial relationship to the President arises from his wife,
Suzanne Walker, who is the first cousin of former President George Herbert Walker
Bush, and the first cousin once removed of the current President George Walker Bush.
Mr. Robinson did not disclose the relationship upon his appointment. When asked
about the relationship, Mr. Robinson deemphasized its significance by observing that
the Bush family is notably large.°2

The indisputable facts are that Mr. Robinson is a close enough member of
the Bush family to have received two Presidential appointments and to have provided
financial support for the very person whose decisions are at issue in the arbitration. Mr.
Robinson was appointed as the Legal Adviser in the U.S. State Department while
George Herbert Walker Bush held the office of Vice President of the United States. Mr.

Robinson was appointed by President George Walker Bush as one of four U.S.

°2 See Letter from Davis R. Robinson to Gonzalo Flores (May 6, 2005) at n. 1 (After stating that his wife
was “a first cousin, once removed, of the President,” Mr. Robinson added, “As you may know, the
President's larger family is sizeable, and she is one of twenty or more who fit this designation.”)

representatives on the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.® Mr. Robinson and his wife also
have been active contributors to the political campaigns of the two Bush Presidents.

As Legal Adviser, Mr. Robinson was the principal legal counsel to the
United States on foreign policy matters and represented the United States in
international legal disputes.®° The Office of the Legal Adviser represents the United
States in investor-state arbitrations and has conducted the United States’ defense
against Tembec’s claims before the NAFTA Article 1120 and Consolidation Tribunals.
Thus, Mr. Robinson was also chief lawyer for the opposition; Tembec is suing Mr.
Robinson’s principal former client.

Mr. Robinson could not have doubted the relevance of his relationship to
President Bush from reading Tembec’s NAFTA Chapter 11 Statement of Claims and the

briefing on the issue of his potential conflict.°° Tembec is suing the United States

58 See Public Papers of the Presidents, Digest of Other White House Announcements (May 27, 2002)
attached at Appendix Tab GG. Mr. Robinson denied in his May 6, 2005 letter having received
appointments in two different Republic administrations. The appointment he did not acknowledge or
disclose was the Presidential assignment as an ICSID arbitrator.

54 According to www.politicalmoneyline.com, a nationally-acclaimed Internet website that monitors
Federal Election Commission data, Mr. Robinson made the following contributions to federal political
campaigns: the maximum allowed $1000 for the 1988 election to “George Bush for President Inc.; the
maximum allowed $1000 for the 1992 election to “Bush-Quayle 92 Primary Committee Inc.”; the
maximum allowed $1000 for the 2000 election to “Bush for President Inc.”; $1000 for the 2000 election to
“DC Republican Committee Federal Campaign Committee”; $2000 for the 2000 election to National
Republican Senatorial Committee; $1200 for the 2000 election to Republican National Committee; $1575
for the 2000 election to Leboeuf Lamb Green & Macrae Political Action Committee; and $2000 for the
2004 election to “Bush-Cheney '04 (Primary) Inc.” Mrs. Robinson matched many of these contributions
with the maximum allowed: $1000 for the 1988 election to “George Bush for President Inc.”; $1000 for
the 1992 election to “Bush-Quayle 92 Primary Committee Inc.”; $1000 for the 2000 election to “Bush for
President Inc.” The records do not indicate any campaign contributions for the 1996 Republican
Presidential Campaign of Senator Robert Dole. See documents attached at Appendix Tab HH.

Government for over US$200 million in damages for measures taken by Executive
Branch agencies under the direction of President George Walker Bush. At least three
cabinet officials have been involved in the dispute. Mr. Bush has been personally
involved in establishing or ratifying United States policy in this dispute, as shown by his
personal conversations with the Canadian Prime Minister. Measures undertaken by the
United States Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) and the United States
International Trade Commission (“ITC”) include “employ[ing] methodologies that had
never before been used and that Commerce itself had rejected on prior occasions as
arbitrary and capricious.”°” Tembec detailed in its Statement of Claims various
improper acts undertaken by Commerce, the ITC, and the Office of the United States
Trade Representative (“USTR’) (which is in the Executive Office of the President),
including unreported ex parte communications between Commerce, which is required
by international law to be a neutral investigating body, and Petitioners, destroying e-
mails and thereby covering up ex parte meetings, and the U.S. Trade Representative,
Robert Zoellick, personally involving himself in the critical circumstances finding of the
investigation.©® Although the measures have been rejected as unlawful on appeal by
multiple international tribunals, the openly-stated policy of the Bush Administration has

been to ignore these decisions and to delay resolution to Tembec’s detriment.®°

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 26 of 45

These allegations obviously are very serious and damning of President
Bush's policies. They must be heard by “impartial and independent” arbitrators,
according to the FAA and the arbitration agreement. Mr. Robinson has loyally
supported his wife’s cousins in their Presidential campaigns over three decades, and
has benefited from the relationship with Presidential appointments and other
opportunities, including foreign travel with his wife as personal delegates of the

69

Presiden The facts that Mr. Robinson failed to disclose his family relationship until

asked by Tembec; failed then to disclose the full extent of the relationship; and
attempted to diminish its proximity and importance, raise further questions about
partiality.°"

Mr. Robinson's conduct also must be viewed in context. Arbitration is a
consensual process which derives its legitimacy, in part, from the fact that the
arbitrators should be acceptable to all parties.° ICSID routinely vets potential
candidates with the parties and usually will not appoint an arbitrator when any party
objects. Arbitrators routinely withdraw when they are challenged, as seen, for example,

in Mr. Harper’s withdrawal from the Canfor tribunal and Mr. Fortier’s from the

© For example, President George Herbert.Walker Bush sent Mr. and Mrs. Robinson on travel overseas
as part of a United States delegation. See Christopher Connell, Bush Makes Global Relations a Family
Affair: Having a Relative in the White House has its Privileges, Associated Press, Dec. 1, 1991) attached
at Appendix Tab II (“Suzanne Robinson, a Bush cousin, and her husband Davis Robinson, a former State
Department lawyer, were in the official U.S. party that attended the dedication of a new wing of the
Polish-American Children's Hospital in Krakow, Poland. Pope John Paul II also attended the ceremony in
his hometown, along with Polish President Lech Walesa.”).

°" Mr. Robinson’s conflict of interest is at least as salient as the conflict of interest the United States saw
when it forced Mr. Fortier to withdraw his candidacy from the Consolidation Tribunal. The law partners
who had represented Canadian interests in the Softwood Lumber dispute were known to have left Mr.
Fortier’s firm, taking that portfolio with them; Mr. Fortier was himself not involved, and the Canadian
parties’ defense of the Softwood Lumber dispute was not material to the arbitration. Mr. Robinson's
loyalties to President Bush, who was personally involved in the dispute and whose administration's
actions are at the heart of Tembec’s claim, presented a more immediate and manifest conflict.

® See Exhibit 1, Declaration of The Hon. Ronald A. Cass (Feb. 14, 2006) (“Cass Decl.”) at 9.

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 27 of 45

Consolidation Tribunal. “[E]ven the most experienced arbitrators whose reputations for
fairness are strong routinely withdraw” where a party's challenge to the appointment “is
at most colorable.”.©° Mr. Robinson's refusal to withdraw “where the arbitrator is related
to an officer of one of the parties, and where the same arbitrator was the former head of
the legal office responsible for defending that party in international arbitrations” was
contrary to a practice legitimizing international arbitration.

Tembec does not have to prove actual bias. Mr. Robinson’s relationship
to the President, his failure to disclose the relationship, and his conduct when it was
disclosed, would lead a “reasonable person ... to conclude that [he] was partial.”® He
cannot be viewed as an independent and impartial arbitrator. In this situation, the
Award should be vacated for “evident partiality.”

B. The Consolidation Tribunal As Constituted Unfairly Favored Respondents
In The Arbitration

The appointment of Mr. Robinson and the other arbitrators raises a
second issue requiring vacation of the award. ICSID chose two arbitrators from the
ICSID Panel of Arbitrators, which is composed of persons chosen by member
governments. Mr. Robinson came from the United States’ pre-approved list of arbitrator
candidates on the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators. Tembec did not appoint, nor was it asked
to recommend, any of the candidates for the Consolidation Tribunal.

These appointments create the extraordinary situation of a tribunal with a

single party-appointed arbitrator and another arbitrator appointed by a government with

83 id. at 47.

°4 See id. at J] 8-9 (“I would expect that the challenged arbitrator in such a situation would withdraw from
the arbitral tribunal.”).

24

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 28 of 45

a common interest with the United States. The appointment process gives the United
States unfair power in the arbitration. U.S. courts have recognized that awards should
be set aside when they are contrary to the arbitration agreement or public policy. In this
case, the constitution of the tribunal violated both. A well recognized public policy is
that arbitration tribunals should not unfairly represent one party in disputes.©° NAFTA
Article 1126 cannot be interpreted to violate U.S. public policy.

1. Arbitration Awards From Tribunals That Unfairly Represent One
Party Contravene Public Policy

Under NAFTA Article 1126(5), the ICSID Secretary-General is required to
choose a consolidation panel from the following sources in their order of availability: the
roster, to which Article 1124(4) refers; the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators; or, in the
discretion of the Secretary-General. The chairman is not to be a national of any of the
“Parties,” that is the three NAFTA countries. The remaining arbitrators should be one
national from the disputing Party, the United States in this case, and one of a Party of
the disputing investors, in this case Canada.

ICSID has never created the Article 1124(4) roster of expert international

arbitrators. The ICSID Panel of Arbitrators is created from nominations from each

87

member governmen Mr. Robinson was appointed to the ICSID Panel by President

AN challenge to the arbitrator-selection process is a separate and independent ground to not enforce an
arbitration award. See McMullen v. Meijer, Inc., 355 F.3d 485, 494 n.7 (6th Cir. 2004) (“When the
process used to select the arbitrator is fundamentally unfair ... the arbitral forum is not an effective
substitute for a judicial forum, and there is no need to present separate evidence of bias or corruption in
the particular arbitrator selected.”). See also Hooters of America v. Phillips, 173 F.3d 933, 941 (4th Cir.
1999) (‘The material breach of this duty warranting rescission is an issue of substantive arbitrability and
thus is reviewable [apart from grounds for vacatur] before arbitration.”).

®” See ICSID Convention, art. 3 ("The Centre shall have an Administrative Council and a Secretariat and
shall maintain a Panel of Conciliators and a Panel of Arbitrators."); /d. at art. 13(1) ("Each Contracting
State may designate to each Panel four persons who may but need not be its nationals.").

the ICSID Panel. Professor de Mestral, a Canadian, was appointed at the discretion
of the Secretary-General.”° Professor van den Berg, the Tribunal chairman, was
appointed to the ICSID Panel by the Government of The Netherlands.”!

Courts have found as a nonstatutory basis for vacatur that arbitration
awards should not be enforced when they are contrary to public policy.”? The public
policy must be “well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained ‘by reference to the
laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public
interests.”

U.S. courts have recognized a public policy that arbitration tribunals
should not unfairly represent one party, and have declined to enforce awards from
unbalanced tribunals even when the arbitration agreement so requires. See Hooters of
America, 173 F.3d at 940 (award rescinded when all members of the arbitration tribunal

(‘W]e conclude that the so-called arbitration provision, giving ... [one party] power to
decide disputes between its members and defendant, is contrary to public policy.”).

Several appellate courts have relied on “an Aesopian metaphor” to
articulate the public policy:

Let us assume for a minute that for some reason all the rabbits and

all the foxes decided to enter into a contract for mutual security,

one provision of which [was] that any disputes arising out of the

contract would be arbitrated by a panel of foxes. Somehow that

shocks our consciences, and it doesn’t help the rabbits very much

either.”
This principle is consistent with the UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration applicable to the
NAFTA Consolidation Tribunal. See UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration, Arts. 6(4) and 15
(‘[T]he appointing authority shall have regard to such considerations as are likely to
secure the appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator...” “[T]he arbitral
tribunal may conduct the arbitration in such a manner as it considers appropriate,

provided that the parties are treated with equality...”).

2. The NAFTA Consolidation Tribunal Unfairly Represented
Respondents To The Exclusion Of Claimants

The Consolidation Tribunal has the same deficiency found fatal in Hooters
of America, 173 F.3d at 940. Mr. Robinson and Professor van den Berg were named
from lists chosen by governments who have an interest, as respondents in investment

See Ditto, 861 P.2d at 1003-04 (quoting Bd. of Educ. of Berkeley v. W. Harley Miller, Inc., 236 S.E.2d
439, 443 (W. Va. 1977)).

28

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 32 of 45

disputes (and never claimants), to decide against the investor. Mr. Robinson was
chosen from a list pre-approved by President Bush, whose decisions were at issue in
the dispute. Tembec, by contrast, had no input into the selection of any of the
arbitrators. In Hooters, the Fourth Circuit held “that the promulgation of so many biased
rules--especially the scheme whereby one party to the proceeding so controls the
arbitral panel--breaches the contract entered into by the parties.” 173 F.3d at 937.

The Sixth Circuit vacated an arbitration award in Texas E. Transmission
Corp., 285 F.2d 536, where the decision had involved only one party-appointed
arbitrator on the tribunal. The second party-appointed arbitrator had been prevented
from hearing the claim because he was appointed three days late. The court stated that
“the predominant purpose of the parties to this agreement, as in every arbitration, was
to have their dispute determined by a board free from partiality. ... With all the arbitrators
representing one party only, the party unrepresented would in some cases b[e] at the
mercy of his opponent and the result a foregone conclusion.” /d. at 540).

Even assuming that the appointment of tribunal members drawn from the
ICSID Panel of Arbitrators was not inherently biased toward respondent governments,
ICSID could have appointed a balanced tribunal consistent with the terms of NAFTA
Article 1126. The ICSID Panel contains names of American arbitrators appointed by
other governments who are members of the ICSID Convention. ICSID could have
named an American arbitrator from the ICSID Panel who was not appointed to that list
by the President of the United States. Uzbekistan, for example, named an American
lawyer to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators. Alternatively, |CSID could have solicited

names of Canadian arbitrators from Tembec, so that an arbitrator pre-approved by

29

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 33 of 45

Tembec could counterbalance Mr. Robinson, the pre-approved U.S. appointment.
Nothing in Article 1126 envisioned a single-party appointed arbitrator.

The Government of Mexico apparently recognized this public policy in the
only other known attempt to consolidate NAFTA Chapter 11 claims. In that instance,
the respondent Government of Mexico and the two claimants contracted to avoid the
inequitable results of a tribunal deciding issues on the merits of the Claimants’ NAFTA
Chapter 11 claims when the tribunal did not fairly represent respondents and claimants.
See Corn Products International, Inc. v. United Mexican States and Archer Daniels
Midland Co., et. al. v. United Mexican States, |CSID case No. ARB(AF)04/5 (May 20,
2005) at {J 2 (describing the arbitration parties’ agreement that, in the event of
consolidation, a tribunal other than the consolidation tribunal would be chosen by
consent of the arbitration parties and this new tribunal would proceed to address the
consolidated claims on the merits). Once ICSID had named Messrs. Robinson, de
Mestral and van den Berg to the Consolidation Tribunal, the United States showed no
interest in making a similar agreement with the Claimants, and pressed for a decision
from the biased Consolidation Tribunal that would prevent any of the Claimants from
ever having heard the merits of their claims.

Cc. The Consolidation Tribunal Had No Power To Act While Constituted In A
Manner Inconsistent With NAFTA Article 1126

 

NAFTA Article 1126 is the source of authority for the Consolidation
Tribunal to be formed and to resolve certain disputes. An arbitration tribunal that has
not been formed in a manner consistent with its source of authority—the agreement—
has no power to act. See, e.g., Cargill Rice, Inc. v. Empresa Nicaraguense De

Alimentos Basicos, 25 F.3d 223, 225 (4th Cir. 1994).

30

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 34 of 45

The appointment procedures in NAFTA Article 1126 did not require the
Consolidation Tribunal to be appointed in a way that unfairly favored the United States,
with a de facto party-appointment to the tribunal while Tembec had none. NAFTA
Article 1126(5) sets forth the procedure for appointment and composition of the
Consolidation Tribunal, including, “One member shall be a national of the disputing
Party and one member shall be a nation of the Party of the disputing investor.” This
provision is modified by NAFTA Article 1126(1): “A Tribunal established under this
Article shall be established under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules . ...”. UNCITRAL
Rule 6(4) and U.S. public policy require the tribunal to be “fair and impartial.””°

ICSID named Mr. Robinson, an arbitrator pre-chosen by the United
States; Mr. van den Berg, chosen by another government (always a respondent); and a
third arbitrator at the Secretary-General’s discretion. No arbitrators were proposed or
chosen by Tembec. This method of appointment was not required, and is not designed
to obtain a fair and impartial tribunal. It therefore violates NAFTA Article 1126.

The three Consolidation Tribunal arbitrators could have been appointed at
the discretion of the ICSID Secretary-General, as NAFTA Article 1126 allows, while still
complying with the nationality distribution contained within the article. The Secretary-
General could have appointed without using pre-approved government lists.

D. Nothing About The Consolidation Tribunal’s Consolidation Order

Contradicts The Indications Of Bias In Mr. Robinson’s Relationship To The

United States Or The Unbalanced Constitution Of The Tribunal

The Consolidation Tribunal accepted virtually all of the United States’

arguments in favor of consolidation, even when those arguments contradicted the only

”° See Section Il. B.1.

31

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 35 of 45

other consolidation award by a Consolidation Tribunal. In a strikingly similar situation,
the High Fructose Corn Syrup consolidation tribunal (“HFCS Tribunal”) decided not to
consolidate two NAFTA Chapter 11 claims brought against Mexico for its policies
protecting domestic corn syrup producers. The Consolidation Tribunal’s 180-degree
turn from the HFCS Tribunal’s reasoning and decision was based not on a materially
different set of facts, but on a different conclusion that apparently it wanted to reach,
based on its own interpretation of the criteria for consolidation. This dramatically
different decision on consolidation, reasoning common issues to opposite conclusions
unequivocally in the United States’ favor, is further evidence of the Consolidation
Tribunal’s partiality toward the United States.
Ill. | THE CONSOLIDATION TRIBUNAL EXCEEDED ITS POWERS

While potential challenges to two arbitrators, Mr. Robinson and Prof. de
Mestral, were pending, the Consolidation Tribunal assumed jurisdiction over all of the
dispute, stayed the Article 1120 Tribunals, and scheduled briefing and a hearing. These
acts cancelled Tembec’s jurisdictional hearing before its Article 1120 Tribunal and
prevented the Canfor Article 1120 Tribunal, which had already completed a jurisdictional
hearing, from ruling. These acts were improper, premature and voided all subsequent
acts, including the rulings that the United States had not waived consolidation by waiting
for more than a year and a half to file the motion, and the decision itself to consolidate.

Section 10 of the FAA requires this Court to vacate the arbitration award
granted by the Consolidation Tribunal where “the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or

so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award on the subject

32

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 36 of 45

matter submitted was not made.” Arbitration is contractual; the arbitrator's power is
defined by the contours of the arbitration agreement. See United Steelworkers of Am.
V. Warrior & Gulf Navigation Co., 363 U.S. 574 (1960).”” “[A]n arbitral award regarding
a matter not within the scope of the governing arbitration clause is one made in excess
of authority, and a court is precluded from giving effect to such an award.” Davis v.
Chevy Chase Financial Ltd., 667 F.2d 160, 165 (DC Cir. 1981). Arbitrators "do not bind
principals or contracting parties when they go beyond the authority delegated to them.
When they exceed that authority their decision in the area of that departure is not
binding ....". Marceron v. Chevy Chase Services, Inc., 258 F.2d 155, 158 (D.C. Cir.
1958).

A. An Arbitration Tribunal Taking Actions Without Proper Authority Exceeds
Its Powers Under 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(4)

Courts vacate arbitration awards made by arbitrators who are not
appointed in accordance with the procedure provided in the parties’ agreement. See
Cargill Rice, 25 F.3d at 225 (citing Szuts v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 931 F.3d 830,
832 (11th Cir. 1991); Avis Rent A Car System, Inc. v. Garage Employees Union, 791
F.2d 22, 26 (2d Cir. 1986); Bear Stearns & Co. v. N.H. Karol & Assocs., Ltd., 728 F.
Supp. 499, 501-02 (N.D. Ill. 1989).). See also 9 U.S.C. § 5 (‘If in the agreement
provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator or arbitrators or an
umpire, such method shall be followed....”). The Fourth Circuit in Cargill Rice vacated

an arbitration award where the institution administering the arbitration did not allow the

789 U.S.C. §10(a)(4).

7’ See also Matteson v. Ryder System Inc., 99 F.3d 108, 112 (3d Cir. 1996) (“[A]n arbitrator may not
venture beyond the bounds of his or her authority.”).

33

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 37 of 45

parties to select the arbitrators by mutual consent as was required by the dispute
resolution clause in the parties’ agreement.

The Second Circuit similarly denied enforcement of a foreign award issued
by an arbitrator who was not appointed in accordance with agreed-upon procedures. In
Encyclopaedia Universalis S.A. v. Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., 403 F.3d 85 (2d Cir.
2005), the arbitration clause between the arbitrating parties “required the two party-
appointed arbitrators to disagree on a third arbitrator before asking the Tribunal to
appoint one.” One of the party-appointed arbitrators instead requested of his own
volition the appointment of the third arbitrator to establish the tribunal. The Second
Circuit applied Article V of the New York Convention and found the appointment of the
third arbitrator to have been premature and inconsistent with the parties’ agreement.”®

The Second Circuit also held that the premature appointment of the third
arbitrator could not be cured by a suspension of the proceedings to allow the party-
appointed arbitrators to first disagree on a third arbitrator: “We agree, for the reasons
expressed by the District Court, that ‘the ... premature appointment of [the third

arbitrator] irremediably spoiled the arbitration process.” 403 F.3d at 91.7

” article V(1)(d) of the New York Convention provides as a defense to enforcement of a foreign arbitral
award, ““[t]he composition of the arbitral authority or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the
agreement of the parties.”

”® The Second Circuit said that it would not deny enforcement of the award under 9 U.S.C. § 10(a)(4) (the
arbitrators “exceeded their powers”) because the action before the court strictly was one of enforcement
of an award under the New York Convention, instead of an action to vacate an award under § 10 of the
FAA. However, the Second Circuit acknowledged that “[u]Jnder the FAA, an award issued by arbitrators
who are not appointed in accordance with agreed-upon procedures may be vacated because the
arbitrators ‘exceeded their powers.” 403 F.3d at 92.

B. The Consolidation Tribunal Exceeded Its Powers By Prematurely
Exercising Authority While Subject To Challenge

The Consolidation Tribunal exceeded its authority when it stayed
Tembec’s Article 1120 tribunal proceedings even while the Consolidation Tribunal’s
authority still was subject to an unresolved arbitrator challenge. The UNCITRAL Rules
required the Consolidation Tribunal to allow Tembec the opportunity to challenge the
appointment of Mr. Robinson before the tribunal exercised Article 1126 powers,
suspending Tembec’s Article 1120 proceedings (Article 1126(9)), and ordering briefs
and a hearing on consolidation (Article 1126(2)).

Articles 9 through 12 of the UNCITRAL Rules address the challenge of
arbitrators. Article 9 sets out a duty for arbitrators governed by the Rules to disclose
“any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his impartiality or
independence.” Article 10(1) permits the parties to an arbitration to challenge the
appointment of an arbitrator where “circumstances exist that give rise to justifiable
doubts as to the arbitrator's impartiality or independence.”

Articles 11 and 12 establish the procedures for an arbitrator challenge.
Article 11(1) provides for a party to challenge the appointment of an arbitrator within
fifteen days of appointment, or fifteen days after the disclosure of circumstances raising
doubts about the arbitrator's impartiality. When a party challenges an arbitrator, it first
asks the other party to agree that the arbitrator be dismissed, or asks the arbitrator to
withdraw. See Article 11(2). Should there be no agreement for withdrawal, the
challenging party may turn next to an appointing authority (in Tembec’s case, ICSID) to
make a decision on the challenge. See Article 12. In making its determination, the

appointing authority “shall have regard to such considerations as are likely to secure the

35

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 39 of 45

appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator, and shall take into account as
well the advisability of appointing an arbitrator of a nationality other than the nationalities
of the parties.” Article 6(4).°°

The drafters of the UNCITRAL Rules understood and intended that a
tribunal subject to a timely arbitrator challenge under the Rules would not take any
action in the arbitration with respect to the challenging party. The travaux preparatoires
to the UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration explain what happens when a party challenges an
arbitrator's appointment under Article 10:

Challenge of an arbitrator results in an interruption of the course of

arbitral proceedings and a successful challenge will result in a

serious interruption arising from the need to appoint a substitute

arbitrator and the possible need to repeat hearings held prior to

such challenge (para 3. of article 12). It is therefore desirable that

challenges, if any, should be made at the earliest possible stage in

the arbitral proceedings. The time-limit of 30 days imposed by this

paragraph seeks to achieve this objective.*

The placement in the UNCITRAL Rules of the provisions regarding the
tribunal’s composition promotes the drafters’ understanding. Articles 9 through 12 are
part of Section II of the Rules, “Composition of the Arbitral Tribunal,” and precede
Section III, “Arbitral Proceedings,” which provides for the presentation of arguments and
evidence, as well as Section IV, “The Award,” concerning decisions by the tribunal.

The International Bar Association’s “Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in

International Arbitration” reinforces the principle that arbitration tribunals do not have

power to take action against a party while there is a pending challenge brought by that
party as to the tribunal’s authority:

The purpose of the [potential conflict] disclosure is to inform the

parties of a situation that they may wish to explore further in order

to determine whether objectively—i.e., from a reasonable third

person’s point of view having knowledge of the relevant facts—

there is a justifiable doubt as to the arbitrator's impartiality or

independence. If the conclusion is that there is no justifiable doubt,

the arbitrator can act. ... Of course, if a party challenges the

appointment of the arbitrator, he or she can nevertheless act ifthe

authority that has to rule on the challenge decides that the

challenge does not meet the objective test for disqualification.°2

The right to challenge an arbitrator for bias under Article 10 would have
little meaning were the tribunal permitted to make decisions impacting the challenging
party before the time to challenge the initial appointment had concluded or any
challenge had been decided: “[I]t is simple common sense that arbitrators should allow
the parties the fifteen-day period for challenge and should not take actions affecting the
case during that time. A challenging party could preserve its objection to allow for a
motion to vacate in domestic courts, but Articles 11(3) and 12, which provide for the
arbitrator's replacement, demonstrate that arbitrator challenges meant more to the
drafters than merely the opportunity for a challenging party to proffer an objection for the
record. A contrary reading of the UNCITRAL Rules would allow a biased arbitrator to
be appointed, subsequently disclose his bias, and act to the detriment of one party

before that party could challenge the arbitrator's appointment, or have that challenge

decided by the appointing authority.

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 41 of 45

ICSID declared the Consolidation Tribunal established on May 6, 2005,
the same day upon which Mr. Robinson disclosed, only after being asked and not fully,
his relationship to the President of the United States. Article 10 provided Tembec
fifteen days to challenge Mr. Robinson's appointment following the disclosure. On May
19, 2005, two days before Tembec’s allotted fifteen days had expired, the Consolidation
Tribunal decided to suspend Tembec’s Article 1120 proceedings, and thus canceled the
Article 1120 tribunal's jurisdictional hearing scheduled six months prior for June 2 and 3.
Tembec filed a timely and detailed challenge to Mr. Robinson’s appointment on May 20.

Tembec’s Article 1120 Tribunal had declined to enter a stay of the
proceedings when requested by the United States, after it filed its consolidation petition.
The arbitrator challenge was not resolved until June 16, 2005, but the Consolidation
Tribunal, including Mr. Robinson, nevertheless continued to act in the interim by
scheduling a hearing on consolidation and ordering the submission of pre-hearing briefs
from Tembec and other parties. Tembec only learned the results of its challenge thirty
minutes before the hearing on consolidation was to begin.

The Consolidation Tribunal’s premature actions could not be justified by
ICSID’s subsequent denial of the arbitrator challenge. The tribunal’s premature
exercise of its authority “irremediably spoiled the arbitration process.” See
Encyclopaedia Universalis, 403 F.3d at 92.

Tembec was entitled to fifteen days to evaluate the arbitrators named to
the Consolidation Tribunal, and was entitled to submit its challenge to their appointment
in accordance with the UNCITRAL Rules. The Consolidation Tribunal did not respect

those rights and exceeded its powers under the Rules by acting before the time for

38

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 42 of 45

Tembec’s challenge had expired and before Tembec’s challenge had been resolved. 84
Arbitration tribunals do not have the prerogative to ignore rules under which the parties
have consented to arbitration: “The value of arbitration depends...in large measure on
the fidelity paid by arbitrators to the contracts from which their powers derive.”®>

The Consolidation Tribunal’s actions “contravene[d] the evident intent of
the UNCITRAL Rules” and had detrimental consequences for Tembec.® Had the
Consolidation Tribunal waited for Tembec’s challenge to be resolved before deciding to
suspend Tembec’s Article 1120 proceedings, Tembec likely would have been able to
complete a hearing on jurisdiction before a consensually-formed Article 1120 tribunal,
or alternatively received a decision from the Article 1120 tribunal on the United States’
objections to jurisdiction of Tembec’s NAFTA Chapter 11 claims.°” Despite having
brought its NAFTA Chapter 11 claim against the United States in December 2003,
Tembec has yet to obtain a decision on any aspect of its claims—jurisdiction, merits, or
damages—due to interruptions by the United States and by the Consolidation Tribunal.
Tembec has withdrawn from the Consolidation Tribunal’s proceedings and brought this

action before the Court rather than permit a decision on jurisdiction from a tribunal that

asserted, the arbitrators should not act while the challenge is pending. They should stay their hand
unless and until the challenge is resolved.”).

°7 Tembec asked the Article 1120 tribunal to decide the jurisdictional challenge from the United States on
papers submitted, see Letter from Elliot J. Feldman to Florentino P. Feliciano et al (May 9, 2005),

persisted in delaying. See Letter from Andrea J. Menaker to Florentino P. Feliciano et al (May 9, 2005),

does not have the proper authority to decide that question, and is unfairly partial toward
the United States.
Cc. The Consolidation Tribunal Exceeded Its Powers By Deciding To

Consolidate Claims Before The Article 1120 Tribunals Decided Whether
There Existed Claims Subject To Consolidation

The Consolidation Tribunal’s authority under Article 1126 is to consolidate
“claims” where the prerequisites for consolidation have been established. The Tribunal
“may ... assume jurisdiction over, and hear and determine together, all or part of the
claims [or] one or more of the claims....” NAFTA Article 1126(2). The Consolidation
Tribunal exercised authority beyond that permitted under NAFTA Article 1126 because
it assumed authority over the validity of claims before addressing the claims
themselves. Article 1126 confers authority only over claims, not over jurisdictional
objections, which are not claims. The United States is not a claimant, and the
objections raised by the United States that the Consolidation Tribunal elected to
arbitrate were not claims.

The Consolidation Tribunal here stripped the Article 1120 tribunals of
authority to determine the validity of the claims, and moved swiftly to assert its own
authority to decide validity (by consolidating the jurisdictional objections raised by the
United States) before reaching the claims themselves. The United States contended
there were no valid claims. Were the United States correct, there would have been no
claims to consolidate, but this issue was precluded when the Consolidation Tribunal
asserted its authority to address the United States’ objections before turning to the

claims at all — the claims it was consolidating. This assertion of authority violated the

40

Case 1:05-cv-02345-RMC Document 7-1 Filed 02/17/2006 Page 44 of 45

plain language of Article 1126, which limited the tribunal to jurisdiction over the “claims,”
not to questions of whether the claims could be heard at all.

Chapter 11 of NAFTA allows for a very limited range of jurisdictional
questions, making all jurisdictional challenges inevitably similar. The Consolidation
Tribunal used the similarity of the jurisdictional challenges as a basis for consolidation.®°
The tribunal had no authority over objections to jurisdiction, and certainly could not
decide similarity of claims on the basis of similar jurisdictional objections.

The predicate for the Consolidation Tribunal’s existence is that “claims”
exist for which there may be common questions of law or fact warranting
consolidation.®° What must be determined to be in common are laws and facts about
the claims, not the jurisdictional objections to them. The Consolidation Tribunal might
decide whether claims should be consolidated, but that decision could be made only
after it had been determined that there were any cognizable Chapter 11 claims at all.
Thus, the Consolidation Tribunal had no authority under NAFTA to consolidate
Tembec’s Article 1120 proceedings and assume jurisdiction over them, because the
Article 1120 tribunal had not decided whether Tembec had a valid arbitration claim in
light of the United States’ jurisdictional objections. See AT&T Technologies, 475 U.S. at
651 (“arbitrators derive their authority to resolve disputes only because the parties have

agreed in advance to submit such grievances to arbitration.”)
