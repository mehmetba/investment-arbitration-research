PETITION TO CONFIRM FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARD

Petitioner, LLC Energoalliance, by and through its attorneys, Arnall Golden Gregory
LLP, respectfully alleges and states as its Petition against Respondent, the Republic of Moldova,
as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. This is an action for recognition and enforcement of a foreign arbitral award
pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 21
U.S.T. 2517, T.LA.A. 6997, 330 U.N.T.S. 3 (the “New York Convention’), as implemented in
Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, codified at 9 U.S.C. § 201 et seg. The arbitral award
was rendered in favor of LLC Energoalliance (“Energoalliance”) and against the Republic of
Moldova (“Moldova”) on October 25, 2013 by an arbitral tribunal seated in Paris, France.

2. The New York Convention, at Article 3, obligates each contracting state to

“recognize [foreign] arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with local

69136142

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 2 of 24

procedural law. The United States recognizes and enforces “only those awards made in the
territory of another Contracting State.” 21 U.S.T. at 2566. The arbitral award rendered in favor
or Energoalliance was made in France, which is a party to the New York Convention, and thus
the award is eligible for enforcement here. Energoalliance seeks confirmation and enforcement
of the arbitral award.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

3. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 9
U.S.C. § 203, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330 & 1331, and 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seg.

4. The subject matter jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) to confirm
arbitral award against a foreign state provided that a foreign state does not have immunity’.

5. Moldova is not entitled to immunity because it is a foreign state as defined in the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seg. and this case comes
within 28 U.S.C. § 1605 (a)(6), which except from immunity actions to confirm an arbitral award
governed by the New York Convention which provides for recognition and enforcement of
arbitral awards and to which the United States is a party.

6. Moldova is further not entitled to immunity under the implied waiver exception
established under 28 U.S.C. § 1605 (a)(1) because it agreed to arbitration in France. See
Foremost-McKesson, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 905 F.2d 438, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing
S. Rep. No. 94-1310, at 18 (1976); H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 18 (1976)), reprinted in 1976
U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6617).

7. The federal question jurisdiction exists pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 9 U.S.C.

' “The district courts shall have original jurisdiction without regard to amount in controversy of any nonjury civil
action against a foreign state as defined in section 1603 (a) of this title as to any claim for relief in personam with
respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under sections 1605-1607 of this title or under
any applicable international agreement.” 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a).

6913614v2

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 3 of 24

§ 2037 because this is an action to confirm arbitration award issued under the New York
Convention.

8. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Moldova pursuant to the FSIA, which
specifies that “[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim for relief
over which the district courts have [subject-matter] jurisdiction under” 1603(a) “where service
has been made under” § 1608. 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b).

9. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 204 and 28 U.S.C. §
1391(f)(4), which provides that a civil action against a foreign state may be brought in the United

States District Court for the District of Columbia.

THE PARTIES

10. Petitioner Energoalliance is a limited liability company organized in accordance
with the laws of Ukraine.

11. Respondent Moldova is a foreign state as defined in the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. § 1602

16. In 1999, Energoalliance became a party to a complex set of agreements, the end
result of which was the supply of electricity from Ukraine to Moldtranselectro, a Moldovan
state-owned entity. When Moldtranselectro failed to make payments for the supplied electricity,
Energoalliance acquired the debts and attempted to collect them in the Moldovan courts. During
the course of protracted court proceedings, Moldova breached its obligations under the ECT in
numerous respects, such that Energoalliance was denied the benefits of its investment in
Moldova.

17. On May 12, 2010, as required by the relevant provisions of the ECT,

Energoalliance sent a request for amicable resolution of the dispute to Moldova but received no

response.

6913614v2

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 6 of 24

18. On July 8, 2010 and August 18, 2010, Energoalliance issued notices of arbitration
to Moldova requesting an ad hoc arbitration in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”) pursuant to Article
26(4)(b) of the ECT. See Decl. of Viacheslav Lych (the “Lych Decl.”) at { 14 and Exs. E & F,
respectively.

19. An ad hoc arbitral tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 26 of the
ECT and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, and, following a full exchange of written evidence
and pleadings, an arbitral hearing took place in Paris, France from July 4-6, 2012. At the hearing,
both parties presented their arguments and evidence to the arbitral tribunal.

20. The arbitral tribunal issued the final Arbitral Award on October 23, 2013 (the
“Award”). A certified copy of the Award in the original Russian is annexed to the Lych
Declaration as Exhibit A, while a certified translation of the Award is annexed as Exhibit B to
the Lych Declaration.

21. In the Award, the arbitral tribunal concluded that Moldova breached its
obligations to Energoalliance under the ECT in several respects, including by issuing a decree
stripping Moldtranselectro of its assets and transferring them to other entities, and by engaging in
quasi-judicial ex-parte proceedings which provided the Moldovan courts with the purported
grounds to deny Energoalliance’s claims.

22. Accordingly, the arbitral tribunal held that Moldova breached its obligation to
“create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions” with regard to the
Energoalliance’s investment and to ensure that the Energoalliance’s investment enjoys “fair and
equitable treatment” as required by Article 10(1) of the ECT.

23. As a result of Moldova’s breaches, the arbitral tribunal ordered Moldova to pay

6913614v2

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 7 of 24

Energoalliance the following amounts:

a. MLD 195,547,212 (one hundred ninety-five million, five hundred forty-
seven thousand, two hundred and twelve Moldovan Lei) as the amount of
Energoalliance’s lost investment;

b. MLD 357,916,008 (three hundred fifty-seven million, nine hundred
sixteen thousand and eight Moldovan Lei) as interest for the period up to
May 31, 2012;

one hundred seventy five Moldovan Lei) as interest for the period between

June 1, 2012 and the date of the award;

d. $200,000 (two hundred thousand United States Dollars) as
Energoalliance’s attorneys’ fees in arbitration;

e. $340,000 (three hundred forty thousand United States Dollars) as
arbitration costs.

24. On October 25, 2013, a copy of the decision was delivered to Moldova’s
arbitration counsel by courier. See Lych Decl. at { 17 and Ex. G.

25. Article 26(8) of the ECT provides that “The awards of arbitration . . . shall be
final and binding upon the parties to the dispute.”

26. Article 34.2 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, entitled “Form and Effect of
the Award,” provides: “[a]ll awards shall be made in writing and shall be final and binding on
the parties.” Burd Decl. at J 10 at Ex. F.

27. Article III of the New York Convention provides that “[e]ach Contracting State
shall recognize arbitral awards as binding...”

28. On or about November 25, 2014, Moldova initiated proceedings in the Paris Court
of Appeal seeking to set aside the Award on grounds similar to those which it unsuccessfully
pursued in the arbitral proceedings. Lych Decl. at { 18. Moldova has not sought a stay of
enforcement proceedings while that action is pending, and no stay has been entered by the Court

of Appeal. Id

6913614v2

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 8 of 24

29. The Award is binding and enforceable notwithstanding the pending action before
the Paris Court of Appeal.

30. Pursuant to the Convention, District of Columbia Code § 15-108 and the terms of
the Award, Energoalliance is entitled to prejudgment interest, calculated at an appropriate rate,
on the Award amount.

WHEREFORE, Petitioner Energoalliance respectfully requests that this Court, pursuant
to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10,
1958, 9 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq., enter an Order:

1. Confirming the aforementioned Award and granting judgment in favor of
Energoalliance and against Moldova in the amount of:

MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES
IN SUPPORT OF PETITION TO CONFIRM ARBITRAL AWARD

Petitioner, LLC Energoalliance (“Energoalliance”), by and through its attorneys, Arnall
Golden Gregory LLP, respectfully submits this Memorandum of Points and Authorities in
support of its Petition to Confirm Foreign Arbitral Award against the Republic of Moldova
(“Moldova”).

L INTRODUCTION

Pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards (the “New York Convention”), Energoalliance is entitled to an order and judgment
confirming a foreign arbitral award it obtained against Moldova. An ad hoc arbitral tribunal
established under the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”)
Arbitration Rules pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”) held
a fully contested arbitration hearing from July 4-6, 2012 in Paris, France. This duly constituted
arbitral tribunal rendered its decision on October 25, 2013, awarding Energoalliance
approximately $40.3 million at current exchange rates in damages, interest, and costs (the

“Award”). To date, Moldova has refused to pay any part of the Award. An order and judgment

695221 1v1

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 12 of 24

should be promptly entered to permit Energoalliance to enforce its Award in the United States.
IL. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. The Energy Charter Treaty

This investment dispute between Energoalliance, a Ukrainian company, and Moldova has
arisen under the ECT, an international convention signed in 1994 in an effort to build a legal
foundation for energy security, based on the principles of open, competitive markets and
sustainable development. See Declaration of Gene M. Burd (the “Burd Decl.”) at {| 5-7 and
Exhibits A-C (copies of the ECT and the entry into force information, respectively). Jd. at J 6,
Ex. B at p. 13. To date, the ECT has been signed or acceded to by fifty-two states, the European
Community and Euratom. /d. at { 7, Ex. C. Both Ukraine and Moldova are signatories to the
ECT. Id. at { 7, Ex. C. The ECT entered into force with respect to Ukraine on January 27, 1999
and with respect to Moldova on April 16, 1998. Id. By accepting the ECT, contracting parties
took on the obligation to extend national treatment, or most-favored nation treatment (whichever
is more favorable), to nationals and legal entities of other contracting parties who have invested
in its energy sector. Jd. at | 6, Ex. B at p. 14. The ECT also established dispute resolution
procedures for cases of investment-related disputes between an investor and a contracting party
set forth in Article 26, which provide, in relevant part, as follows:

arbitration concerning a measure of a sub-national government or
authority of the disputing Contracting Party shall provide that the
Contracting Party may pay monetary damages in lieu of any other
remedy granted. Each Contracting Party shall carry out without delay
any such award and shall make provision for the effective enforcement
in its Area of such awards.
Art. 26, ECT (Burd Decl. at 5 at Ex. A).
B. The Dispute Between Energoalliance and Moldova
The dispute at issue relates to Energoalliance’s investment in the energy sector of
Moldova. See Declaration of Viacheslav Lych (the “Lych Declaration”) at {{] 5-8. In 1999,
Energoalliance became a party to a complex transaction, the end result of which was the supply
of electricity from Ukraine to Moldtranselectro, a Moldovan state-owned entity. Jd. at J{[ 5-7.
‘When Moldtranselectro failed to make payments for the supplied electricity, Energoalliance
acquired the debt. /d. at { 8. However, in breach of its obligations under the ECT, Moldova
engaged in conduct preventing Energoalliance from collecting the debt such that Energoalliance
was denied the benefits of its investment in Moldova. Jd. at {| 9-12.
On May 12, 2010, as required by the relevant provisions of the ECT, Energoalliance sent
a request for amicable resolution of the dispute to Moldova but received no response. Id. at J 13
and Ex. D. On July 8, 2010 and August 18, 2010, Energoalliance issued notices of arbitration to
Moldova (/d. at { 14 and Exs. E & F) requesting an ad hoc arbitration be conducted in
accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules pursuant to Article 26(4)(b) of the ECT.
Cc. The Arbitration Award
An ad hoc arbitral tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 26 of the ECT and
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, and, following a full exchange of written evidence and

pleadings, an arbitral hearing took place in Paris, France from July 4-6, 2012. See Lych Decl. at

14. At the hearing, both parties, through counsel, presented their arguments and evidence to the

695221 1v1

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 15 of 24

arbitral tribunal. /d. The arbitral tribunal issued the final Arbitral Award on October 25, 2013
(the “Award”). Id. at J 15 at Exs. A & B (Arbitral Award and certified English translation
thereof).”

In its lengthy and carefully-reasoned opinion, the tribunal found that Moldova breached
the ECT by issuing a decree stripping Moldtranselectro’s assets and transferring them to other
entities in order to place them beyond the reach of Energoalliance, as well as by engaging in
quasi-judicial ex parte proceedings which provided Moldovan courts with purported grounds to
deny Energoalliance’s claims. /d. at {J 10-11, 15 and Ex. B at J] 346 & 356. The arbitral
tribunal concluded that these acts were in violation of Moldova’s obligation to “create stable,
equitable, favourable and transparent conditions” with regard to the Energoalliance’s investment
and to ensure that the Energoalliance’s investment enjoys “fair and equitable treatment” as
required by Article 10(1) of the ECT. /d. at { 15.

As a result of the Moldova’s breaches, the arbitral tribunal ordered Moldova to pay
Energoalliance the following amounts:

a. MLD 195,547,212 (one hundred ninety-five million, five hundred forty-
seven thousand, two hundred and twelve Moldovan Lei) as the amount of
Energoalliance’s lost investment;

b. MLD 357,916,008 (three hundred fifty-seven million, nine hundred
sixteen thousand and eight Moldovan Lei) as interest for the period up to
May 31, 2012;

c. MLD 39,417,175 (thirty-nine million, four hundred seventeen thousand,
one hundred seventy five Moldovan Lei) as interest for the period between
June 1, 2012 and the date of the award;

d. $200,000 (two hundred thousand United States Dollars) as
Energoalliance’s attorneys’ fees in arbitration;

e. $340,000 (three hundred forty thousand United States Dollars) as
arbitration costs.

? Exhibit B shall hereinafter be referred to as the “Award.”

695221 1v1

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 16 of 24

Id. at J 15 and Ex. B at J] 413, 422, 427, 424, & 435 (summarized at {| 436). The Award was
confirmed and a writ of execution (an Exequatur) was issued by the High Court of Paris. Id. at J
16 and Exs. A & C (Arbitral Award including Exequatur and certified translation of the
Exequatur).

D. Moldova’s Failure to Pay the Award

The chair of the arbitral tribunal sent a letter dated October 25, 2013 to Energoalliance
which stated that a copy of the decision was delivered to both Energoalliance’s and Moldova’s
arbitration counsel by courier on the same day. Lych Decl. at {17 and Ex. G. Although Article
26(8) of the ECT provides that “The awards of arbitration . . . shall be final and binding upon the
parties to the dispute” (Burd Decl. at Ex. A) and Article 34.2 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules, entitled “Form and Effect of the Award,” provides “[a]ll awards . . . shall be final and
binding on the parties,” (Jd. at Ex. F). Moldova has failed to pay any of the Award amounts.
Lych Decl. at J 20.

On November 25, 2013, Moldova filed an application with the Paris Court of Appeal
seeking to set aside the Award based on substantially the same arguments Moldova
unsuccessfully raised during the arbitration proceedings. Jd. at {| 18. Moldova has not sought a
stay of enforcement proceedings while that action is pending, and no stay has been entered by
the Paris Court of Appeal. Id.

On April 15, 2014, Energoalliance sent a letter to Moldova seeking voluntary compliance
with the Award. Id. at { 19 and Ex. H. However, on August 5, 2014, Moldova rejected
Energoalliance’s request, making this petition necessary. See id. at { 20 and Ex. I.

Ill. ARGUMENT
The confirmation of an arbitration award is a summary proceeding that merely makes

what is already a final arbitration award a judgment of the court. See Yusuf Ahmed Alghanim &

695221 1v1

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 17 of 24

Sons, W.L.L. v. Toys “R” Us, Inc., 126 F.3d 15, 23 (2d Cir. 1997). The review of arbitration
awards is extremely limited. See Major League Baseball Players Ass’n v. Garvey, 532 U.S. 504,
506 (2001); Kurke v. Oscar Gruss and Son, Inc., 454 F.3d 350, 354 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Under the
New York Convention, this Court “shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for
refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said Convention.”
The Award should be confirmed because (i) this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this
action and personal jurisdiction over Moldova; and (ii) Federal Arbitration Act requires
confirmation of an award issued under the New York Convention.

A. Jurisdiction and Venue

This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §
203, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330 & 1331, and 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq. This Court has personal
jurisdiction over Moldova pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b). Venue is proper in this district
pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 204 and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4).

1. This Court Has Subject Matter Jurisdiction Over This Action

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this case because: (i) pursuant to 28
U.S.C. § 1330(a) district court has jurisdiction to confirm arbitral award against a foreign state
provided that a foreign state is excepted from immunity under the applicable provisions of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunity Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq.; and (ii) 28 U.S.C. § 1331
and 9 U.S.C. § 203 grant jurisdiction for actions to confirm arbitration award issued under the
New York Convention.

a. Subject Matter Jurisdiction Under the Foreign Sovereign Immunity
Act

Title 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a)* grants jurisdiction to confirm arbitral award against a foreign

The district courts shall have original jurisdiction without regard to amount in

695221 1v1

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 18 of 24

state provided that a foreign state is not entitled to immunity under the FSIA. Here, Moldova is
not entitled to immunity because of (i) the arbitration exception pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1605
(a)(6); and (ii) the implied waiver exception pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1605 (a)(1).

Title 28 U.S.C. § 1605 (a)(6) grants an exception to immunity when an action is brought
to confirm an arbitral award, made pursuant to an agreement to arbitrate made by the foreign
state for the benefit of a private party, and the agreement governed by a treaty in force for the
United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards."

Moldova has acceded to the ECT, which provides for arbitration of disputes of the nature
that gave rise to the arbitration between Energoalliance and Moldova, as well as for the
recognition and enforcement of awards resulting from such arbitrations. See Burd Decl. at {5 at
Ex. A. Art. 26 of the ECT specifically required Moldova to submit to arbitration under the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. /d. The agreement to arbitrate was formed when Energoalliance
consented to the arbitration with Moldova by issuing a dispute resolution notice on May 12,
2010. See Lych Decl. at { 13. As discussed below, the Award issued by the tribunal in Paris,

France was made under the New York Convention, to which the United States is a party, and

 

controversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state as defined in
section 1603 (a) of this title as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to
which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either under sections 1605—
1607 of this title or under any applicable international agreement.

28 U.S.C. § 1330 (a).
4 A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United
States ... in any case ... in which the action is brought, either to enforce an
agreement made by the foreign state with or for the benefit of a private party to
submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise
between the parties with respect to a defined legal relationship, whether
contractual or not, concerning a subject matter capable of settlement by
arbitration under the laws of the United States, or to confirm an award made
pursuant to such an agreement to arbitrate, the agreement or award is or
may be governed by a treaty or other international agreement in force for the
United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards...

 

 

28 U.S.C. § 1605 (a)(6).

695221 1v1

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 19 of 24

which calls for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.

Accordingly, jurisdiction is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) because Moldova is
excepted from immunity under the arbitration exception at 28 U.S.C. § 1605 (a)(6) to confirm an
arbitration award issued pursuant to the New York Convention. See FG Hemisphere Assocs.
LLC v. Democratic Republic of Congo, 637 F.3d 373, 375 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“[arbitration
exception] permits a plaintiff to bring suit against a sovereign “to confirm an award made
pursuant to . . . an agreement to arbitrate”).

Moldova is further not entitled to immunity under the implied waiver exception under 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) because it agreed to arbitration in France. See Foremost-McKesson, Inc. v.
Islamic Republic of Iran, 905 F.2d 438, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (citing S. Rep. No. 94-1310, at 18
(1976); H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 18 (1976)), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6617). The
FSIA’s legislative history indicates that implied waivers may be found “in cases where a foreign
state has agreed to arbitration in another country or where a foreign state has agreed that the law
of a particular country should govern a contract.” H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, at 18 (1976). Here
Moldova has agreed to arbitrate and fully participated in the arbitration in Paris, France.
Accordingly, the implied waiver exception pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) applies and
subject matter jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a).

b. Federal Question Jurisdiction

The federal question jurisdiction exists in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 9

U.S.C. § 203 because this is an action to confirm arbitration award issued under the New York

Convention.

> “An action or proceeding falling under the [New York] Convention shall be deemed to arise under the laws and
treaties of the United States. The district courts of the United States II have original jurisdiction over such an
action or proceeding, regardless of the amount in controversy.” 9 U.S.C. § 203.

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 20 of 24

2. This Court Has Personal Jurisdiction Over Moldova
The FSIA specifies that “[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every
claim for relief over which the district courts have [subject-matter] jurisdiction under” 1603(a)
“where service has been made under” 28 U.S.C. § 1608. 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b). In other words,
“under the FSIA, ‘subject matter jurisdiction plus service of process equals personal
jurisdiction.” GSS Group Ltd. v. Nat’l Port Auth., 680 F.3d 805, 809 (D.C. Cir. 2012) quoting
Price v. Socialist People’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 95 (D.C. Cir. 2002).
Furthermore, Moldova is a foreign sovereign and therefore not a person under the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment and, thus, has no right to assert a personal jurisdiction defense.
Id. at 809.
3. Venue in This Court is Proper
Title 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4) which provides that a civil action against a foreign state
may be brought in this district and confers venue in this Court.

B. The Award Against Moldova Was Made Under the New York Convention

The Award falls under the New York Convention because the Award was made in France
and Moldova and Energoalliance consented to the dispute resolution procedure set forth in the
ECT which provides for the application of the New York Convention.

The New York Convention applies to the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards
made in the territory of a State other than the State where the recognition and enforcement are
sought. See Art. I(1), New York Convention. Energoalliance seeks recognition in the United
States of the Award, which was made in France, which meets the requirements of Article I(1), as
both the United States and France are parties to the New York Convention. See Burd Decl. at Ex.
E.

The New York Convention obligates contracting states to recognize an “agreement in

-10-
695221 1v1

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 21 of 24

writing” under which the parties agreed to submit to arbitration. See id. Decl. at Ex. D Art. II(1),
New York Convention. In that regard, the ECT provides that the requirement of an “agreement
in writing” for purposes of the New York Convention is satisfied by the unconditional consent of
each Contracting Party to submit to dispute resolution procedures set forth in the ECT, on the
one hand, and written consent of the Investor to submit the dispute for resolution under the
provisions of the ECT, on the other. See Id. at Ex. A, Art. 26(3)-(5).

Moldova, as a signatory to the ECT and the State with respect to which the ECT entered
into force, is a Contracting Party within the meaning of the ECT. As such, Moldova gave its
unconditional consent to submit to international arbitration in accordance with the ECT. See Id.
at Art. 26(3)(a). Energoalliance is an Investor within the meaning of the ECT. See Lych Decl. at
Ex. B, ff 142-159. By issuing a notice of initiating ECT dispute resolution procedure on May
12, 2010, Energoalliance, as the Investor, consented to arbitration under the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules. See Burd Decl. at Ex. A, Art. 26(4)(b). Taking together, the consent given by
Moldova in the ECT and the consent given by Energoalliance in the May 12, 2010 notice
constitute an “agreement in writing” for the purposes of the New York Convention. /d., Art.
5(a)(ii).

Furthermore, the Award falls under the New York Convention because it has arisen out
of a set of commercial agreements involving Energoalliance. See 9 U.S.C. 202 (“An arbitration
agreement or arbitral award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which
is considered as commercial, including a transaction, contract or agreement . . . falls under the
Convention.”); see also Azhar Ali Khan v. Parsons Global Servs., Ltd., 428 F.3d 1079, 1082
(D.C. Cir. 2005)(“[T]he Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral

Awards ... provides federal jurisdiction in matters involving an arbitration agreement arising out

-ll-
695221 1v1

Case 1:14-cv-01921-CRC Document1 Filed 11/14/14 Page 22 of 24

of a commercial relationship where one party to the agreement is not a United States citizen.”);
DRC, Inc. v. Republic of Hond., 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 151090 (D.D.C. Oct. 23, 2014) (“That a
government is a party to a transaction does not destroy its commercial character; indeed, the fact
that an agreement to arbitrate is in the contract between a government and a private person may
confirm its commercial character . . .””).

Cc. The New York Convention Requires Recognition of the Award Against
Moldova

Title 9 U.S.C. § 207 requires confirmation of the award issued under the New York
Convention unless one of the grounds for refusal applies.° Article III of the New York
Convention provides, in relevant part, that “[e]ach Contracting State shall recognize arbitral
awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of procedure of the territory
where the award is relied upon. . .” See Burd Decl. at Ex. D at Art. III. Congress has enacted 9
U.S.C. § 201 et seqg., to implement the New York Convention. See 9 U.S.C. § 201 (New York
Convention “shall be enforced in United States courts in accordance with this chapter.”); see also
Comm'ns Imp. Exp. S.A. v. Republic of the Congo, 757 F.3d 321, 324 (D.C. Cir. 2014)(“The
Convention is a multilateral treaty that, with exceptions, obligates participating countries to
honor international commercial arbitration agreements and to recognize and enforce arbitral
awards rendered pursuant to such agreements.”) (citations omitted) (citing S. Exec. Rep. No. 10,
at 3-4 (1968) and testimony of Amb. Richard D. Kearney, Office of the Legal Adviser, Dep't of
State”). Accordingly, the Award against Moldova should be confirmed.

Iv. CONCLUSION

Accordingly, pursuant to the New York Convention and 9 U.S.C. § 207, the Court should

© None of the grounds for refusal set forth in Article V of the New York Convention apply to this case and the
burden of proof rests on the party challenging the award. Compagnie Des Bauxites de Guinee v. Hammernills, Inc.,
1992 WL 122712, at *3 (D.D.C.May 29, 1992).

enter an Order confirming the Award in the following amounts:

a.

MLD 195,547,212 (one hundred ninety-five million, five hundred forty-
seven thousand, two hundred and twelve Moldovan Lei) as the amount of
Energoalliance’s lost investment;

MLD 357,916,008 (three hundred fifty-seven million, nine hundred
sixteen thousand and eight Moldovan Lei) as interest for the period up to
May 31, 2012;

MLD 39,417,175 (thirty-nine million, four hundred seventeen thousand,
one hundred seventy five Moldovan Lei) as interest for the period between
June 1, 2012 and the date of the award;

$ 200,000 (two hundred thousand United States Dollars) as
Energoalliance’s attorneys’ fees in arbitration;

$ 340,000 (three hundred forty thousand United States Dollars) as
arbitration costs.

Additionally, Energoalliance requests that the Court award prejudgment interest on the

foregoing sums; as parties are generally entitled to prejudgment interest on the award from the

date of the award through the date of entry of judgment by the court. E.g. Compagnie des

Bauxites de Guinee v. Hammermills, Inc., Civ. No. 90-0169, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8046 at *26

(D.D.C. May 29, 1992) (“Courts have consistently allowed prejudgment interest in actions

brought to confirm arbitral awards.” (quoting Reefer Express Lines Pty., Ltd. v. Gen. Auth. For

Supply Commodities, 714 F. Supp 699, 699 (S.D.N.Y. 1989))); see also D.C. Code § 15-108.

Accordingly, Energoalliance is entitled to prejudgment and postjudgment interest on the Award.

For the foregoing reasons, petitioner Energoalliance respectfully requests that this Court

enter an Order confirming the Award and enter judgment thereon.
