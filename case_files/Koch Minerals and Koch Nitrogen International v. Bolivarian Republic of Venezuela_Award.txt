PART I: THE ARBITRATION

Introduction

This arbitration concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’’) on the basis of the Agreement between the
Swiss Confederation and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela on the Reciprocal
Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 18 November 1993, which entered into
force on 30 November 1994 (the “BIT” or “Treaty’’), and the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965,

which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Parties

The First Claimant: Koch Minerals Sarl is a company incorporated under the laws of
Switzerland. It was initially named Koch Oil SA, but changed its name to Koch Minerals
SA on 11 April 2003 and its corporate form from S.A. to Sarl on 20 March 2009.! For ease
of reference, the First Claimant and its prior designations are here referred to collectively

as “KOMSA” or “Koch”.

The Second Claimant: Koch Nitrogen International Sarl is also a company incorporated
under the laws of Switzerland. For ease of reference, the Second Claimant is here referred

to as “KNIT”.

Both KOMSA and KNT are “nationals of another Contracting State” as defined in Article
25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Switzerland signed the Convention on 22 September

The Request for Arbitration

On 28 June 2011, the Claimants filed a request for arbitration before ICSID (the “Request”

or “Request for Arbitration”).

On 19 July 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In
the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute
an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID

Arbitration Rules”).

The Arbitration Tribunal

On 19 August 2011, the Claimants informed the Secretariat that they maintained their
proposal made in the Request that the Tribunal consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator
to be appointed by each Party and the third, who would be the president of the Tribunal,
appointed by agreement of the Parties. In this letter the Claimants also appointed the Hon
Marc Lalonde, a national of Canada, as arbitrator and requested that the Chairman of the
Administrative Council appoint any arbitrators not appointed pursuant to ICSID

Convention Article 38 and Rule 4(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

On 23 September 2011, the Secretariat confirmed that, in the absence of any agreement

between the Parties within 60 days after the registration of the Request, the Tribunal would

1.16

1.17

1.18

1.19

1.20

1.21

1.22

1.23

be constituted pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 2(3) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules.

On 27 September 2011, the Secretariat informed the Parties that Mr Lalonde had accepted

his appointment as arbitrator.

On 13 October 2011, the Respondent appointed Justice Florentino Feliciano, a national of

the Philippines, as arbitrator.

By letter of 18 October 2011, the Secretariat informed the Parties that Mr Feliciano had
accepted his appointment as arbitrator and confirmed that, further to the Claimants’ request
and in the absence of the constitution of the Tribunal within 90 days of the Request’s
registration, the Chairman of the Administrative Council, under Article 38 of the ICSID

Convention, would appoint the President of the Tribunal in consultation with the Parties.

The Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, through ICSID’s Secretary-General,

proposed three arbitrators for the Parties’ consideration by letter dated 28 October 2011.

On 31 October 2011, the Claimants informed the Secretariat that the Parties had reached
an agreement to appoint Mr V.V. Veeder, a national of the United Kingdom, as the
President of the Tribunal. On 4 November 2011, Mr Veeder accepted his appointment as

President of the Tribunal.

On 8 November 2011, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators
had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore constituted on that
date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1). Ms Mairée Uran-Bidegain, ICSID

Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

First Disqualification Proposal: On 24 December 2013, the Respondent filed a proposal
for the disqualification of Mr Feliciano as a member of the Tribunal (the “First
Disqualification Proposal”). This was the first of two separate attempts to disqualify

members of the Tribunal.

On 29 December 2013, the ICSID Secretariat notified the Parties that the proceedings were

suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6) and transmitted a schedule for the

1.24

1.25

1.26

1.27

1.28

Parties to submit further observations on the First Disqualification Proposal. In that same
letter, it was noted that according to Procedural Order No. 6, the Respondent’s Rejoinder
was due by 30 December 2013. The Respondent was therefore invited by the Tribunal to
proceed with its written submission on the previously scheduled date in order to minimise

any disruption to the arbitration.

By letter of 30 December 2013, the Respondent stated that it was not in a position to accept

the invitation described above.

The Claimants filed observations on the First Disqualification Proposal on 26 December
2013 and 15 January 2014. The Respondent filed further comments on its proposal on 8
January 2014. On 1 February 2014, Mr Feliciano furnished written explanations pursuant
to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). On 1, 6 and 7 February 2014, the Claimants and the

Respondent filed additional comments.

On 10 February 2014, Mr Veeder and Mr Lalonde (the “Unchallenged Arbitrators”)
notified the ICSID Secretariat that they were “equally divided” within the meaning of
Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4), for reasons
“unrelated to [the] merits or demerits” of the First Disqualification Proposal. On the same
date, ICSID’s Secretary-General transmitted the Unchallenged Arbitrators’ notice to the
Parties and informed them that the decision on the First Disqualification Proposal would
be made by the Chairman of the Administrative Council, in accordance with Article 58 of

the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.

On 24 February 2014, after considering the written submissions made by the Parties and
the observations of Mr Feliciano, the Chairman of the Administrative Council decided to
reject the Respondent’s Proposal to Disqualify Mr Feliciano. The Chairman’s written
decision was transmitted to the Parties and the Tribunal. These arbitration proceedings

resumed on that same day.

Second Disqualification Proposal: On 29 March 2014, shortly before the hearing fixed to
take place in Paris, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of all three Members of
the Tribunal (the “Second Disqualification Proposal’). On that same date, the ICSID

Secretariat notified the Parties that the arbitration proceedings were suspended pursuant to

1.29

1.30

1.31

1.32

o
1.33

ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). It also transmitted a schedule for the Parties to submit further

observations on the Second Disqualification Proposal.

The Claimants submitted their observations on the Second Disqualification Proposal on 1
and 15 April 2014. The Respondent filed further comments on its Second Disqualification
Proposal on 16 April 2014.

On 8 April 2014, the Secretariat transmitted to the Parties the respective statements of
Mr Veeder, Mr Lalonde and Mr Feliciano on the Second Disqualification Proposal (the

“Arbitrators’ Statements”).

On 30 April 2014, after considering the Parties’ observations and the Arbitrators’
statements, the Chairman of the Administrative Council issued a Decision rejecting the

Respondent’s Second Disqualification Proposal. The Chairman decided (inter alia) that:

“[A]t the heart of the Respondent’s argument is its discontent with a provisional
ruling taken by the Tribunal in order to decide on a procedural question. The
mechanism set forth under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule
9 seeking to safeguard the integrity of the proceeding is not a mechanism for
reconsideration of adverse rulings. Absent any objective circumstances, the mere
existence of an adverse ruling in and of itself, is insufficient to prove a manifest lack

of impartiality or independence, as required by Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID

Convention.”?

These arbitration proceedings resumed on that same day, namely 30 April 2014.

The Arbitral Procedure

First Meeting: On 21 December 2011, the Tribunal held its First Session with the Parties
by telephone conference call. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had
been validly appointed. It was agreed (inter alia) that the applicable ICSID Arbitration
Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be
English and Spanish and that the place of these arbitration proceedings would be

Washington, DC, USA, with all such matters to be memorialised in a later procedural order

including the Minutes of the First Session. The Parties also agreed that these arbitration
proceedings would comprise a written phase and an oral phase. The Parties were unable at
that time to agree on a full schedule for the jurisdictional/merits phase(s) of these

proceedings.

On 2 January 2012, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 1 requiring the Claimants

to file a full memorial of their case on 2 April 2012.

On 16 February 2012, in response to the Respondent’s written application dated 2 February
2012, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2, suspending these arbitration
proceedings for a two-month period (starting on 2 February 2012 and ending on 2 April
2012), due to the regrettable death in January 2012 of the Attorney General of Venezuela,
Dr Carlos Escarraé. The Tribunal’s procedural order also provided that the Claimants’

Memorial should now be filed on 2 June 2012.

On 18 May 2012, the Tribunal sent to the Parties its draft Procedural Order No. 3, Minutes
of the First Session and Schedule of Written Pleadings and requested the Parties’ written
comments on these drafts. Between 31 May 2012 and 28 June 2012, the Parties submitted

written comments on the Tribunal’s draft schedule.

On 3 July 2012, having considered the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal issued its
Procedural Order No. 3, Minutes of the First Session and Schedule of Written Pleadings,

in which it fixed the procedural calendar for the arbitration.

The Tribunal’s schedule for the written phase was subsequently amended on 15 August
2012 by agreement of the Parties, and on 22 November 2012, 18 December 2012, 29 May
2013 and 26 February 2014, pursuant to Procedural Orders of the Tribunal Nos. 4, 5, 6 and
7 respectively, upon the application of a Party or as a result of the Respondent’s two

disqualification proposals (described above).

Bifurcation. Considering the Respondent’s various applications for extensions to the
deadline to submit its counter-memorial, the Tribunal further decided in Procedural Order
No. 4 dated 22 November 2012, that any jurisdictional objections would be joined to the

merits pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41.

The schedule for the oral phase was originally fixed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order
No. 6 of 29 May 2013 and subsequently amended by the Tribunal following a joint
application by the Parties, whereby the Parties agreed to amend the original hearing dates

but could not agree on new hearing dates.

On 13 March 2014, the Tribunal decided that the Hearing would be held in Paris, France,
in two separate sessions: the first hearing starting on 31 March 2014 and ending no later
than 4 April 2014 (mid-day); and the second session starting on 19 May 2014 and ending
no later than 23 May 2014.

On 29 March 2014, the first part of the hearing scheduled to start in Paris on 31 March
2014 was adjourned as a consequence of the Respondent’s Second Disqualification
Proposal. The final dates for the oral phase of this proceeding were re-fixed orally by the
Tribunal on 19 May 2014, and further confirmed in the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 9
of 4 August 2014.

The Claimants’ Submissions: As regards the written phase of the arbitration, the Claimants
filed (i) their Memorial on 4 June 2012, (ii) their Reply on the Merits and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction on 2 September 2013 and (iii) their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on

14 March 2014.

The Respondent’s Submissions: The Respondent filed (i) its Counter-Memorial on the
Merits and its Preliminary Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal on 28
February 2013, and (ii) its Rejoinder on the Merits and its Reply on Jurisdiction on 3 March
2014.

The Claimants’ Testimony: The Claimants adduced signed written statements from the

following factual witnesses:
= Brent W. Gwaltney, statements dated 30 May 2012, 20 August 2013 and 23 May 2014;

Respondent, as explained below).

The Respondent also adduced signed expert reports from Daniel Flores (of Econ One)

dated 28 February 2013 and 3 March 2014.

Procedural Meetings: Further to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 5, the Tribunal held
a procedural conference call with the Parties on 6 March 2013 to discuss the need, scope

and timing of any document production and the dates of the proposed two-week hearing.

On 19 May 2014, upon the resumption of these arbitration proceedings (following the
rejection of the Respondent’s Second Disqualification Proposal) the Tribunal held a
procedural meeting with the Parties in Paris, at the offices of the World Bank (‘the Paris
Procedural Meeting”). Mr Veeder, Mr Lalonde and the Parties’ legal representatives
attended the procedural meeting in person; and Mr Feliciano attended by video-link from
the offices of the World Bank in Manila. (Mr Feliciano had recently suffered an accident

and had been medically forbidden to travel to Paris). The Paris Procedural Meeting was

1.51

1.52

1.53

1.54

1.55

1.56

conducted without objections from the Parties. It was recorded, with the verbatim transcript

(corrected) issued to the Parties on 20 May 2014.

In addition, the President of the Tribunal, with the Parties, and the Secretary of the
Tribunal, held pre-hearing organisational meetings by telephone conference calls on 24

March 2014 and 25 August 2014.

The First (September) Hearing: As regards the oral phase of this arbitration, the first
hearing on jurisdiction and merits, including the examination of witnesses, took place at
the World Bank in Paris, France on 8 September and subsequently from 10-12 September
2014 (the “First (September) Hearing”).

In addition to the Tribunal and its Secretary, the following persons were present at this First

Other Procedural Matters

The Submission of Additional Documents: By letter of 12 March 2014, the Claimants
requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to produce: (a) a witness statement and
an expert report submitted by the Respondent in Gambrinus Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic
of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/31) (the “Gambrinus Arbitration”), made by a
witness and an expert who also submitted a statement and a report on behalf of the
Respondent in this case, and (b) a jurisdictional decision rendered in Longreef Investments
A.V.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (ICSID Case No. ARB/11/5). The Claimants
further requested permission from the Tribunal to introduce into the evidential record ten
new documents (the “Additional Documents”), which they sent to the Tribunal and the

Respondent along with their request.

On 14 March 2014, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ request and requested in
response that, if the Tribunal were to accede to the Claimants’ request, the first week of the
hearing (as then scheduled) should be moved to 19 May 2014 so as to give the Respondent
sufficient time to prepare a response. The Claimants opposed the Respondent’s request on
16 March 2014. The Respondent replied on 17 March 2014, reiterating its request that the
first week of the scheduled hearing be postponed to May 2014, and submitting that failure
to provide such further time would infringe upon the Respondent’s due process and

procedural rights. The Respondent further stated that it reserved all its rights in this respect.

On 18 March 2014, the Tribunal decided upon the Claimants’ request of 12 March 2014
(the “18 March Decision”). In this decision, the Tribunal rejected the Claimants’

application regarding the Gambrinus documentation and the Longreef decision.

3 References to all transcripts of hearings below are made thus: “First (September) Hearing D1.10” denotes Day 1,

1.66

1.67

1.68

1.69

As to the Additional Documents, being the third application in the Claimant’s request, the

Tribunal decided (inter alia) as follows:

“As regards the third application, given that this documentation is said by the
Claimants to respond directly in rebuttal to the Respondent’s (delayed) Rejoinder of
3 March 2014, the Tribunal here orders its admission de bene esse for the purpose
only of allowing the Tribunal to read the documentation in order to decide the
Claimants’ application and the Respondent’s opposition (i.e. not as ‘evidence’).

The Tribunal also orders the Claimant’s third application (with the Respondent’s
opposition) to be argued more fully during the Parties’ opening oral submissions at
the outset of the first week’s hearing in Paris beginning on Monday, 31 March 2014.
In the event (which should not here be assumed) that the Tribunal should then decide
to admit into evidence any part of this documentation, the Parties should be ready
for any consequential order, including any response from the Respondent as regards
further submissions and rebuttal evidence.”

On 21 March 2014, the Claimants made a second request to the Tribunal for permission to

submit six additional documents into the evidential record (the “New Documents”).

On 24 March 2014, the Tribunal, represented by its President, held a pre-hearing
organisational meeting with the Parties and the Secretary of the Tribunal, by telephone
conference call. The Respondent reiterated that it was participating in this call with “full
reservation of its rights.” The President noted (inter alia) that he could not by himself alone
decide the disputed admissibility of the Claimants’ application of 21 March 2014 without
his co-arbitrators and that the Tribunal expected the Respondent to comment on the

Claimants’ application regarding Mr Toro on the first day of the scheduled hearing.

On 25 March 2014, the Respondent objected to the Claimants’ 21 March 2014 application
and to the 18 March Decision, arguing that it prejudiced its due process rights. The
Respondent further alleged that the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 3 obliged the
Claimants to argue the relevance of each document before submitting it to the Tribunal and
that the Respondent should be accorded sufficient time to provide counter-arguments and
evidence on the relevance of each disputed document. The Respondent requested again
that the merits phase of the Hearing be postponed until 19 May 2014, and it further reserved
all its rights with respect to the facts surrounding the Claimants’ applications and the

Tribunal’s decisions. The Claimants opposed the Respondent’s request on 26 March 2014.

1.74

The Admissibility of the Written Statement of Mr Toro: On 19 March 2014, the Claimants
requested that the written statement of Mr Francisco Toro (the “Toro Statement”) be struck
from the evidential record, on the grounds that, inter alia, Mr Toro had passed away before
his statement was submitted to the Tribunal, and he was therefore not available for cross-
examination at the Hearing. The Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on this

application by 24 March 2014.

On Thursday, 27 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, deciding (inter

alia) the following:
“To require all pending procedural applications to be raised with the Tribunal
during the Parties’ opening submissions on 31 March 2014, including [...]: (i) the
submission of additional documents into the evidential record; (ii) the hearing
schedule and the Claimants’ latest application for 15 minutes’ direct examination;
(iii) the Respondent’s application for an adjournment of the hearing; and (iv) the
admissibility of the witness statement of Mr Francisco Toro; and without the Tribunal
prejudging any of these applications, the Parties shall prepare for the five-day
hearing to the fullest extent, including all preparations on the provisional assumption
that any or all of these applications may be refused by the Tribunal on 31 March
2014.”

On 29 March 2014, as already summarised above, the Respondent submitted its Second

Disqualification Proposal, which was subsequently rejected by the Chairman of the

Administrative Tribunal on 30 April 2014. As also summarised above, the effect of this

Second Disqualification Proposal was to cause the abandonment of the scheduled hearing

in Paris.

The Respondent filed additional exhibits and correspondence regarding the Toro Statement
on 28 May 2014, followed by the Claimants’ supplementary witness statements of Brent
Gwaltney and Jim Sorlie on 29 May 2014. The Claimants also submitted correspondence
regarding the Toro Statement on 9 June 2014, to which the Respondent replied on 13 June

2014, followed by the Claimants’ application on 26 July 2014.

On 5 September 2014, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 10, whereby it decided

(inter alia):

“a. To permit the Respondent to withdraw from the evidential record the proffered
witness statement of Mr Toro dated 30 December 2013 (as a result of which it shall
not be treated as evidence in these arbitration proceedings); and

b. To reserve its decision for the time being over any adverse inferences to be drawn
from the withdrawal of the Toro Statement and the non-production by the Respondent
of Mr Toro’s witness statement(s) in the Gambrinus arbitration under Procedural
Order No.9.”

1.75 On 19 December 2014, the Respondent transmitted to the Secretariat the Parties agreed
redactions to the Respondent’s Rejoinder and Second EconOne Expert Report that resulted
from Respondent’s withdrawal of the Toro Statement from the record as indicated above.
On 22 December 2014, the Claimants confirmed their agreement with the transmitted
redactions, stating in that same communication that they believed further redactions were

appropriate and necessary, to which the Respondent replied on 29 December 2014.

1.76 Following the reconstitution of the Tribunal as indicated below, on 17 May 2016, the
Claimants submitted an additional application to the Tribunal reiterating their request that
additional redactions be applied to the Respondent’s Rejoinder and the Second EconOne
Expert Report by Dr Flores. This was followed by Respondent’s response of 1 June 2016
and the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 11, of 8 June 2016 ruling on this matter, as

explained below.

1.77 The Advantis Reports: By letter dated 12 March 2014, the Claimants applied to the Tribunal
for permission to introduce into the evidential record a valuation report by Advantis

(known as the Second Advantis Report). The Claimants’ letter stated, in material part:*

“Respondent’s Advantis valuation report of FertiNitro: This document was
referenced in the Claimant’s Reply [paragraph 105] and Mr Brent Gwaltney’s
Second Witness Statement at paragraph 40 and is clearly relevant to the
Respondent’s valuation of FertiNitro in this proceeding. In its Rejoinder [paragraph
228], the Respondent makes reference to the alleged good-faith negotiations, in the
course of which it presented the document (on a non-without prejudice and
confidential basis) to the Claimants. Given that it is already referenced in the
Claimants’ submissions, was created for the Respondent and, therefore, is already in

4 Claimants’ letter to the Arbitral Tribunal of 12 March 2014, p. 4.

15

the Respondent’s possession, there can be no prejudicial effect in admitting the
exhibit at this stage. Furthermore, such evidence of the Respondent’s previous
valuations of FertiNitro should clearly be relevant to the Tribunal’s assessment of
the Respondent’s purported valuation in this proceeding.” (Footnote omitted)
1.78 The Claimants’ application was disputed by the Respondent’s letter of 14 March 2014, to
which the Claimants responded by letter of 16 March 2014 and to which the Respondent
responded in turn by letter of 17 March 2014.

1.79 By its instruction letter of 18 March 2014, the Tribunal decided to examine the disputed
document for itself, for the time being de bene esse only. (The Tribunal there also indicated
that the dispute between the Parties would be discussed further with the Parties during the
forthcoming hearing, then scheduled to start on 31 March 2014; but later suspended

following the Respondent’s Second Disqualification Proposal).

1.80 Subsequently, during the Paris Procedural Meeting on 19 May 2014, the Parties agreed
upon the admission of this document into the evidential record, with others.> This Second
Advantis Report was designated as C-157, comprising of three pages under the title
“Special Document” with five pages of annexes, submitted in the original Spanish with an
English translation. The Respondent submitted, with the Claimants’ agreement, the First
Advantis Report designated as R-86, comprising of 22 pages of the report, the emails from
Advantis to Pequiven and from Pequiven to the Fertinitro shareholders of 18 and 19 May
2011, respectively, transmitting the report, and five pages of annexes in the original

Spanish.

1.81 Post-Hearing and Costs Submissions: The Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs

on 30 January 2015. The Parties filed their submissions on costs on 13 February 2015.

1.82. Mr Feliciano regrettably died in December 2015, at a time when the Tribunal’s

deliberations had not been fully completed.

The Rule 12 Resumption of the Proceedings
By letter from the ICSID Secretariat of 16 December 2015, resulting from the death of Mr
Feliciano and the vacancy on the Tribunal, these arbitration proceedings were suspended

pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2).

By letter dated 1 February 2016, the ICSID Secretariat notified the Parties that the vacancy
created in the Tribunal resulting from the death of Mr Feliciano had been filled with the
appointment of Professor Zachary Douglas QC as co-arbitrator made by the Respondent
and, further, that, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 12, these proceedings
resumed as from 1 February 2016 from the point it had reached at the time the vacancy

occurred.

By its Procedural Order No. 11 of 8 June 2016, the Tribunal addressed the Claimant’s
application of 17 May 2016, opposed by the Respondent’s letter dated 1 June 2016, to
redact certain references to Mr Toro in the Respondent’s Rejoinder and its Second
EconOne expert report by Dr Flores adduced by the Respondent. The Tribunal decided to
order parts of the requested redactions from the Rejoinder and the report, as there set out,

subject to further order.

Before the Third (June) Hearing, the Tribunal sent to the Parties non-exhaustive lists of

issues and topics to be addressed at that Hearing. These lists are set out in Part III below.

The Third (June) Hearing: Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 12, an oral hearing was held
at the IDRC in London, United Kingdom on 9 and 10 June 2016, recorded by verbatim
transcript available to the Parties. The procedure for this Reconstitution Hearing was set

by the Tribunal’s letter of 29 April 2016 to the Parties.

In addition to the Tribunal and its Secretary, the following persons were present at this

Third (June) Hearing:

For the Claimants: Mr Jeff Brenner and Mr J. Kory Parkhurst (legal representatives of
KOMSA & KNI); Mr Robert Volterra, Mr Graham Coop, Mr Govert Coppens, Ms Jessica
Pineda, Ms Zusana Morhaéova, Ms Isabella Sif and Ms Chiara Atzeni of the law firm of

Volterra Fietta; and Mr Mark Beckett of the law firm Chadbourne & Parke.

1.90 For the Respondent: Mr Christopher Ryan, Mr Thomas Wilner, Ms Anna Tevini, Mr David
Earnest, Mr Guillermo Salcedo Salas, Ms Evelyn Wiese (all of the law firm of Shearman

& Sterling).

1.91 The Third (June) Hearing was recorded by verbatim transcript in English and Spanish,

available to the Parties.

1.92 On30 June 2016, the Parties completed their respective responses to the Claimants’ Tables
1 to 4 of agreements and disagreements between Mr Giles and Dr Flores, their expert
witnesses on quantum, as requested by the Tribunal at the Third (June) Hearing.° The
Parties submitted their respective updated claims for costs by written submissions dated 8
and 12 July 2016. By several email messages dated 12 and 26 July 2016, the Parties

submitted their respective tables on interest.

1.93 By letter dated 7 July 2016, the Respondent objected to the admissibility of certain parts
of the presentational slides used by the Claimants during their closing oral submissions at
the Reconstituted Hearing. At the Tribunal’s request, the Claimants responded to the
Respondent’s objections by letter dated 22 July 2016. The Tribunal decided to reserve its
decision on the Respondent’s objection until this Award. It has decided to reject that
objection, conscious also that these objected parts play no material part in the reasons for

or result of this Award.

1.94 Closing: This proceeding was closed on August 31, 2017, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration
Rule 38(1).

PART IT: THE PARTIES’ DISPUTE

Introduction

Inevitably, as these arbitration proceedings progressed, the issues arising from the Parties’
original dispute became more complex and significantly more numerous, extending
originally from an ostensible dispute largely about quantum (in regard to KOMSA’s
expropriation claim at the First Session) to a major dispute about jurisdiction, liability,

compensation, interest and costs by the time of this Award.

The Tribunal here summarises only the Parties’ respective cases as to jurisdiction, liability

and quantum. Other parts of the Parties’ respective cases are addressed later in this Award.

The Claimant’s Case

Jurisdiction: In summary, as to jurisdiction, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction over the merits of the Parties’ investment dispute in this arbitration. The
Claimants submit that the dispute arises from several violations by the Respondent of its
obligations under the Treaty and the Claimants’ corresponding rights (including the
Claimants’ rights under customary international law) entitling the Claimants to full
compensation for the losses that the Claimants have suffered as a direct result of the

Respondent’s violations of the Treaty.

The Claimants contend that the Claimants and the Respondent have each consented in
writing to refer such an investment dispute to arbitration in accordance with the ICSID
Convention, as expressed in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 9 of the
Treaty. The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s written consent became effective
upon the entry into force of the Treaty on 30 November 1994, duly accepted by the

Claimants with their Request for Arbitration of 28 June 2011.

The Claimants contend that the Parties’ dispute comprises an “investment dispute” between
a Contracting Party and investors of another Contracting Party and falls within the scope

of the Respondent’s consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1)

21

2.6

2.9

(defining “investors”), Article 1(2) (defining “investment”) and Article 9(5) of the

Treaty. !?

The Claimants submit that both KOMSA and KNI are companies constituted under the
laws of Switzerland and are accordingly “investors” as defined in Article 1(1)(b) of the
Treaty. The Claimants also submit that KOMSA and KNI possessed “investments” in
Venezuela, as defined in Article 1(2) of the Treaty. In particular, the Claimants submit
that: (i) KOMSA, through Koch José, held an interest in the equity of FertiNitro, thereby
constituting an “investment” under the Treaty; and (ii) KNI held an interest in the Offtake

3

Agreement between KNI and FertiNitro,'? constituting rights to performance under a

contract and thereby an “investment” under the Treaty.

The Claimants contend that there is a “dispute” between the Claimants and the Respondent
in respect of the Respondent’s failure to comply with its obligations under the Treaty
towards the Claimants’ investments in Venezuela, including the Respondent’s
expropriation of KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro and KNI’s interest in the Offtake
Agreement, together with the Respondent’s failure to provide any compensation to the

Claimants.

Accordingly, so the Claimants conclude, there is an “investment dispute” between a
Contracting Party and investors of the other Contracting Party that falls within the scope

of the Respondent’s consent to arbitration under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.

The Claimants contend that they requested consultations with the Respondent — to no avail.
On 9 November 2010, Mr Steve Packebush (of KOMSA) sent a letter to Mr Satil Ameliach
(President of Pequiven), copied to His Excellency Rafael Ramirez (the Respondent’s
Minister of Energy and Petroleum) to notify formally the Respondent of the investment

dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent relating (as the Claimants contended)

'2 Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Venezuela on the Reciprocal Promotion and
Protection of Investments (18 November 1993) (“Treaty”) (CLA-1).

'3 Offtake Agreement by and among Pequiven, IPSL, and Koch Oil SA as Buyers and FertiNitro as Seller, dated 8
April 1998 (“Offtake Agreement”) (C-19).

to the Respondent’s violations of the Treaty.'* The Claimants there proposed that
representatives of the Claimants should meet representatives of the Respondent “to
commence discussions and consult as to how Venezuela will compensate Koch for the loss
of its investments in Venezuela.” The Claimants contend that Pequiven failed to make any
offer to the Claimants of compensation for the Respondent’s violations of the Treaty. The
Claimants then instructed their legal representatives (Latham & Watkins) to submit to the
Respondent a further request for consultations, by letter of 20 January 2011 to the
Respondent’s President, copied to (inter alios) the Respondent’s Attorney General.'>
Subsequently, according to the Claimants, meetings were held between representatives of

the Claimants and the Respondent, producing no satisfactory result to either Claimant.

Accordingly, the Claimants conclude that they did request and hold consultations with the
Respondent in order to arrive at an amicable settlement of the Parties’ dispute, as required
by the Treaty. The Claimants further conclude that they also waited until the expiry of the
‘cooling-off’ period required under Article 9(2) of the Treaty, thereupon becoming entitled
to submit the Parties’ dispute to ICSID for arbitration, as they did with their Request for
Arbitration of 28 June 2011 and, further, that this Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the

Parties’ dispute.

Liability: In summary, as to liability, the Claimants contend that the Respondent violated
its obligations in the Treaty causing loss and damage to each of the Claimants and their

investments.

The Claimants contend that during the 1990s, Venezuela was actively pursuing a policy of
encouraging foreign investment, in particular in its hydrocarbon and petrochemicals
industries. At this time, Pequiven (as the Respondent’s state-owned petrochemical
company) was seeking foreign partners to participate in the development of a fertilizer

plant in José in the Venezuelan state of Anzoategui.

In 1997, KOMSA was selected as a foreign partner with the requisite expertise to
participate in the development of the proposed fertilizer plant and to market the fertilizer
to be manufactured by the proposed plant. KOMSA and Pequiven proceeded to enter into
a joint venture for the construction and operation of two ammonia and two granular urea
plants in José (the “FertiNitro Plant’) and the marketing and sale of the ammonia and urea

produced at the Plant.

In March 1998, a series of joint venture companies were formed for the purpose of
implementing the project. These were the FertiNitro Companies (here collectively called
“FertiNitro”). External funding for the development of the FertiNitro Plant was secured
on the understanding that the offtake from the Plant would be sold to KNI, Pequiven and
International Petrochemical Sales Limited (a subsidiary of Pequiven) on the terms
contained in the Offtake Agreement. According to the Claimants, from the outset, the

Offtake Agreement was integral to the Claimants’ investments.

Once external funding for the development of the Plant had been secured, Pequiven,
KOMSA, Snamprogetti Netherlands BV (“Snamprogetti”) and Polar José Investments,
Limited (“Polar”) entered into a series of agreements in respect of the project. These
agreements included: (i) the “Joint Investors’ Agreement” dated 8 April 1998 between
Pequiven, KOMSA, Snamprogetti and Polar,'° which provided (inter alia) that FertiNitro
would be 35% owned by Koch José, 35% owned by Pequiven, 20% owned by
Snamprogetti and 10% owned by Polar; (ii) the “Offtake Agreement” dated 8 April 1998,!7
which granted to KOMSA the right to purchase a guaranteed quantity of ammonia and urea
produced by FertiNitro at a discounted price for a 20-year term (KOMSA, through Koch
José, later owned 25% of the equity in FertiNitro; and KOMSA’s rights under the Offtake
Agreement later vested in KNI) and (iii) the “EPC Contract” dated 8 April 1998,'* for the

construction of the Plant between FertiNitro, CEC and Snamprogetti as the main

contractor.

Construction of the Plant commenced in May 1998 and was completed in December 2001
when FertiNitro granted the provisional acceptance certificate to Snamprogetti. Earlier, in
May 2001, FertiNitro had commenced commercial production at the Plant. The Claimants
submit that, other than certain periods of interruption (for example when PDVSA failed to
provide methane gas or Pequiven failed to provide electricity to the Plant), commercial
production at the Plant continued until the Respondent expropriated FertiNitro on 11

October 2010, as summarised below.

The Claimants contend that the Respondent took unlawful measures against the Claimants’
investments in violation of the Treaty, which have caused the Claimants to suffer
considerable losses. These measures culminated on 11 October 2010 in the expropriation
of KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro and the expropriation of KNI’s interest in the Offtake
Agreement. The Respondent failed to provide to the Claimants any compensation for its
expropriation of their investments. In brief, the Claimants list the Respondent’s unlawful
measures against the Claimants’ investments, in violation of Articles 4(1), 4(2), 6, and

11(2) of the Treaty, as follows.

New and Increased Taxes: The Respondent imposed on FertiNitro a series of new taxes
and tax increases with the object and effect of diverting its profits to the Respondent. This

is the first of KOMSA’s “Historical Losses”.

These new taxes eroded the profitability of FertiNitro and deprived KOMSA of the
economic benefits of its investments. These taxes and tax increases were directly contrary
to KOMSA’s legitimate expectations on which it relied when deciding to invest in
FertiNitro. For example, in December 2005, the Respondent imposed a Narcotic and
Psychotropic Substances Tax on FertiNitro that obliged FertiNitro to allocate funds to
specified social programs or to provide to the Respondent 1% of FertiNitro’s annual net

income. At about this time, the Respondent further enacted the Organic Law on Science,

25

2.20

2.21

2.22

Technology and Innovation.'? It obliged FertiNitro, beginning on 1 January 2006, to
allocate funds to specified scientific development programs or to provide to the Respondent
0.5% of its gross income generated in Venezuela. Further, the municipal tax applicable to
FertiNitro was increased in 2006 from 1% to 2% and in 2007 to 2.4% of FertiNitro’s
turnover. These measures, particularly when considered cumulatively, negatively affected
the profitability of FertiNitro at the expense of KOMSA and to the benefit of the

Respondent.

VAT: The Respondent failed promptly or at all to provide to FertiNitro VAT rebates to
which they were entitled. This is the second of KOMSA’s “Historical Losses”.

In May 1999, the Respondent enacted the Value Added Tax (“VAT”) Law.”° This law
provided for a zero rate tax for exporters and granted to such exporters the right to recover
Special Tax Rebate Certificates (“CERTs’) in respect of VAT paid on the purchase or
import of goods and services. Under the VAT law, the taxpayer would submit a request to
the tax administration of the Respondent, the “SENIAT” (abbreviated from the Spanish
“Servicio Nacional Integrado de Administracién Aduanera y Tributaria’); and the
SENIAT would then issue a “CERT” (abbreviated from the Spanish, “Certificados
Especiales de Reembolso Tributario”). The taxpayer could then use its CERTs to pay any
federal revenue taxes (including income tax and VAT) or assign them to third parties for
similar purposes. FertiNitro paid substantial amounts of VAT to the Respondent during
the course of its operations. In respect of these payments, FertiNitro duly submitted

requests to the SENIAT.

However, from about 2005 onwards, the SENIAT unreasonably and arbitrarily delayed the
issue of CERTs to FertiNitro. This delay resulted in losses to FertiNitro particularly when
the CERTs were paid after considerable delay during which local inflation - increased and
the Venezuelan Bolivar was devalued against hard currencies (including the US Dollar).

The Respondent also failed to provide to FertiNitro a substantial amount of VAT rebates

Law”) (C-43).

despite its obligation to do so. This arbitrary conduct by the Respondent further eroded the
profitability of FertiNitro at the expense of KOMSA (and its other non-State shareholders),

to the benefit of the Respondent.

Urea Decree and Urea Resolution: The Respondent issued a Urea Decree and a subsequent
Urea Resolution that obliged FertiNitro to sell urea to the Respondent (through Pequiven)
at substantially below production costs and market values, as summarised below. This is

the third of KOMSA’s “Historical Losses”.

On 26 February 2007, the President of the Respondent signed Decree 5,218 (the “Urea
Decree”).! The Urea Decree was published in the Official Gazette No. 38,638 on 6 March
2007 and took effect on that date. Article 2 of the Urea Decree provided that:
“Manufacturers, suppliers [...] exporters of nitrogenous fertilizers [...] are required to
supply these on a priority basis to the national market, in accordance with the price
regulations established for their sale.” Article 3 provided that the prices would be
established by joint resolutions of the Ministries of Agriculture and Land, Light Industries

and Trade and Energy and Petroleum.

Pursuant to Article 3 of the Urea Decree, the Respondent’s Ministries of Agriculture, Light
Industries and Trade and Energy and Petroleum issued a joint resolution (the “Urea
Resolution”).”” It was published in the Official Gazette No. 38,674 on 2 May 2007. The
Urea Resolution provided (inter alia) that Pequiven was solely authorised to administer the
delivery of urea in accordance with the Urea Decree and that Pequiven could purchase “the
urea it requires to cover the needs of the Nation, from any manufacturer established in the

country, at the maximum bulk sales price at the plant gate of Bs. 155,200/MT.”?3

The sales prices at which FertiNitro was obliged to sell urea to Pequiven were substantially

less than the costs of production of urea incurred by FertiNitro. Other than Pequiven,

FertiNitro was the sole manufacturer and exporter of urea in Venezuela. Accordingly, the
Urea Decree and the Urea Resolution were aimed by the Respondent directly at FertiNitro
and compelled FertiNitro to divert urea to the Respondent (through Pequiven) at prices that
were below production costs. The quantity of urea that the Respondent (through Pequiven)

could purchase from FertiNitro at the price set in the Urea Resolution was unlimited.

Subsequently, as required by the Urea Decree and the Urea Resolution, FertiNitro sold
substantial quantities of urea to Pequiven at prices significantly below its production costs.
These arbitrary and discriminatory measures by the Respondent eroded the profitability of
FertiNitro at the expense of the Claimants (and the other non-State shareholders), to the

benefit of the Respondent.

Interference - FertiNitro: The Respondent (acting through Pequiven) progressively

interfered in the management and operation of FertiNitro.

KOMSA invested in FertiNitro with the legitimate expectation that its investment was a
commercial venture in which KOMSA and Pequiven would be equal partners. KOMSA
had a legitimate expectation that any control that Pequiven might have over FertiNitro
would be balanced by KOMSA’s control over FertiNitro. KOMSA had a legitimate
expectation that FertiNitro would be operated as a commercial enterprise for the generation

of profits for all its shareholders.

From around 2006, the Respondent, acting through Pequiven, proceeded to interfere in the
management and operation of FertiNitro and ultimately assumed control over FertiNitro.
The Respondent’s strategy culminated in the expropriation of FertiNitro by the Respondent
on 11 October 2010.

Expropriation - FertiNitro: The Respondent expropriated FertiNitro on 11 October 2010

with no compensation, in breach of Article 6 of the Treaty.

On 10 October 2010, the President of the Respondent announced the expropriation of
FertiNitro on his weekly television broadcast “Al6 Presidente”. During this broadcast, the

President signed what appeared to be a decree providing for the expropriation of

28

2.33

2.34

2.35

FertiNitro.24 On 11 October 2010, Decree Number 7713 dated 10 October 2010 was
published in Official Gazette No. 380.113.34. It provided for the expropriation of

FertiNitro (the “Expropriation Decree”).?>

The Expropriation Decree includes the following provisions: Article 1 provides for the
mandatory acquisition by the Respondent of the assets of FertiNitro; Articles 2, 3 and 5
specifically task Pequiven with the role of carrying out the expropriation of FertiNitro and
identify Pequiven as the “expropriation entity”; and Article 6 orders Pequiven to occupy
the assets. The Expropriation Decree made no provision for the payment of compensation

to KOMSA in accordance with the Treaty.

On 11 October 2010, Venezuelan State television reported that the Respondent’s Minister
of Energy and Petroleum of the Respondent had visited the Plant in person in order to take
it over. In his public address at the FertiNitro Plant, the Minister was reported to have
stated, “[W]e are already in control of the Plant and we are carrying out an inspection of
our facilities.”2° Also on 11 October 2010, Mr Clark Inciarte (who was at that time both
President of FertiNitro and an employee of Pequiven) indicated during a telephone call
with the two KOMSA-appointed directors of FertiNitro that FertiNitro was under the
complete control of the State and that its board of directors had ceased to function.?”
Following the announcement of the Expropriation Decree, no board of directors or Finance

Committee meetings of FertiNitro were convened by FertiNitro.

KOMSA had received no advance notice that the Respondent’s President would make this
announcement or that the Respondent would expropriate FertiNitro. KOMSA had no
opportunity to object to this expropriation of its investment in FertiNitro. To the contrary,

the expropriation was announced by the Respondent’s President as a ‘fait accompli’.

Expropriation - KNI: The Respondent also expropriated KNI’s interest in the
Offtake Agreement without compensation, in breach of Article 6 of the Treaty, on 11
October 2010. Contemporary statements made by representatives of Pequiven, as the
expropriating entity for the Respondent which had taken over FertiNitro under the
Expropriation Decree, confirmed to the Claimants that KNI’s interest in the Offtake

Agreement had also been expropriated by the Respondent.

Compensation: In summary, the Claimants contend that the Respondent’s several
violations of the Treaty have caused considerable losses to the Claimants. Accordingly,
the Respondent is obliged to provide to the Claimants full compensation for such losses in

accordance with the applicable principles of customary international law.

The Claimants claim full compensation including (but not limited to) the profits which
KOMSA has lost as a result of the Respondent’s expropriation of its investment in the
equity of FertiNitro, its Historical Losses and the Respondent’s expropriation of KNI’s

interest in the Offtake Agreement.

As later formulated by the Claimants, the compensation claimed by KOMSA for the
unlawful expropriation of its interest in FertiNitro and its Historical Losses amount to US$
444.6 million (as at 30 January 2015); and the compensation claimed by KNI for the
expropriation of its interest in the Offtake Agreement amounts to US$ 227.8 million (also

as at 30 January 2015).7°

The Respondent’s Case

Jurisdiction: In summary, the Respondent objects to the competence or jurisdiction of the
Tribunal and ICSID to address KNI’s claims regarding the Offtake Agreement. The
Respondent contends that it is a “foundational principle of international investment law”
that the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals is limited to “investments” within the meaning of
the ICSID Convention and the applicable investment treaty, law or agreement. In this

arbitration, therefore, KNI may assert a claim only if the Offtake Agreement (a mere

28 Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief (30 January 2015) (“Cls. PHB”), p. 99 (Section VI, (b)(c)).

2.43

commercial sales agreement) constitutes an “investment” within the meaning of both
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(2) of the Treaty. The burden of proof
lies with KNI, which must prove that it has made a covered investment under the ICSID
Convention and the Treaty. The Respondent contends that KNIT has failed to do so because

no such investment exists with respect to the Offtake Agreement.

The meaning of “investment” has an objective and inherent meaning pursuant to both the
ICSID Convention and the Treaty. That meaning, in turn, requires the making of a
“contribution”, over a certain “duration”, with an element of “risk” and subject to
“territoriality”. A mere commercial sales agreement is not an “investment”. KNI’s failure
to fit the Offtake Agreement within the meaning of “investment” strips both ICSID and
this Tribunal of any competence and jurisdiction concerning the alleged expropriation of
the Offtake Agreement in October 2010 and even more so over the termination of the

Offtake Agreement by FertiNitro in February 2012.

Liability: In summary, the Respondent denies any liability to either Claimant under the
Treaty. The Respondent is a sovereign state and guarantor of the public interest within
Venezuela. The Respondent contends that, as such, it has the obligation and the authority
under both national and international law to act in the interest of the people of Venezuela
and their general well-being, including the issuance of laws and regulations and the
mandatory acquisition of private interests. This right is embedded in the Respondent’s
Constitution”? and its Expropriation Law for Public or Social Benefit of 1 July 2002 (the
“Expropriation Law”).*° These texts provide the legal framework for expropriation in the

public interest, as also under customary international law and the Treaty.

The Respondent repeatedly confirmed that sovereign control over the domestic production

of food and food-related products was a matter of national importance in Venezuela. To

that end, in 2007 the Respondent issued the Urea Decree.*! This Decree declared food

production to be in the “national interest,” “essential for the economic and social

development of the Nation,” and “an essential element of national safety and sovereignty.”
As a consequence, the Urea Decree declared nitrogenous fertilizers as goods of “basic

necessity” which were critical to the protection of Venezuela’s national interest.

In 2008, the Respondent issued Decree No. 5,835 (“Decree 5,835”) 32 to ensure that the
supply of products necessary to food production could continue uninterrupted. This Decree
declared goods necessary for food production and products of “basic necessity” to be items

in the public utility and social interest.

Through these measures, and the promulgation of various national plans designed to boost
agricultural productivity, the Respondent articulated a public purpose of securing a
sufficient supply of nitrogenous fertilizer to achieve its goal of food sovereignty within

Venezuela.

Historical Losses: KOMSA asserts, wrongly, that the Respondent breached Articles 4(1),
4(2), and 11(2) of the Treaty in regard to its claims for “Historical Losses.” These claims
relate principally to the following: (i) the enactment of the Organic Law on Science,
Technology and Innovation (the “Science and Technology Law”); (ii) the issuance of the
Municipal Ordinance by the Municipality of Simén Bolivar increasing a pre-existing
municipal tax (the “Municipal Ordinance”);** (iii) the Respondent’s alleged refusal to
provide to FertiNitro certain VAT credits; and (iv) the Urea Decree and the Urea
Resolution. The Respondent submits that these claims for “Historic Losses” are groundless

as described below.

New and Increased Taxes: The Science and Technology Law was a measure of general
application that required companies to invest a small percentage of their revenues back into
the company through scientifically focused research and development. Nothing in that law
conflicts with the Respondent’s obligations under the Treaty. The increase in pre-existing

municipal tax, from 1% to 2% and ultimately to 2.4%, did not violate any of the

45).

2.51

Respondent’s obligations under the Treaty. This municipal tax is generally applicable to
entities operating in the Municipality of Simén Bolivar; it was not directed at FertiNitro;

and it was not punitive.

VAT: As regards the Claimants’ claim regarding VAT credits, the factual evidence shows

that all VAT credits applied for by FertiNitro were, in fact, granted by the Respondent.

The Urea Decree and Urea Resolution: The Urea Decree and Urea Resolution were vital
and necessary measures intended to give effect to the Respondent’s policy of securing
access to materials critical to the production of food in Venezuela. Those measures
required FertiNitro to sell limited quantities of urea to Pequiven to cover any domestic
demand that could not be met through Pequiven’s own production. The Respondent was
forced to enact such measures after FertiNitro’s refusal to make such sales voluntarily on

the basis of need.

Interference — FertiNitro: There is no evidence that the Respondent interfered with the
management and operation of FertiNitro. To the contrary, the evidence shows that the
Respondent took no steps to interfere with FertiNitro’s management or operation.
FertiNitro’s board of directors consisted of nine directors, of which only three were
appointed by Pequiven, with the remaining six appointed by KOMSA and FertiNitro’s
other shareholders. According to the Joint Investors’ Agreement of 8 April 1994 (the

“JIA”), no decision could be taken without KOMSA’s acceptance.*>

Expropriation - FertiNitro: The Respondent denies this claim. FertiNitro was a
Venezuelan corporation and, as such, operated in Venezuela within the legal, political,
social and economic framework of Venezuela. Pequiven was a Venezuelan State-owned
petrochemical company and the 35% owner of FertiNitro and, as such, it spent years
unsuccessfully attempting to persuade FertiNitro voluntarily to engage in commercial

activities that would further the Respondent’s legitimate and reasonable policy objectives

35 JIA (C-18).

33

2.54

2.55

relating to food security in Venezuela. When those efforts failed, Pequiven attempted to

purchase FertiNitro outright, but Pequiven was rebuffed by KOMSA.

After it became clear that FertiNitro would not voluntarily undertake commercial activities
designed to accommodate the Respondent’s interests, the Respondent was left with no
option but to set in motion procedures to acquire FertiNitro in accordance with Venezuelan
law. Thus, on 11 October 2010, the Respondent published the Expropriation Decree,
ordering the mandatory acquisition of FertiNitro’s assets. This Expropriation Decree
declared that the acquisition was part of the Respondent’s long-standing policy to protect
Venezuela from the harmful effects of fluctuations in the global food market by securing
domestic and sovereign control over industries critical to the production of food within

Venezuela.

Although the Expropriation Decree initiated the acquisition process, it did not in and of
itself operate to transfer the ownership of FertiNitro’s assets. According to Venezuelan
law, such a transfer only occurs following a judgment by the Venezuelan courts. Pequiven,
as the designated acquiring entity, initiated the necessary proceedings in the Venezuelan

courts on 26 July 2011, after KOMSA withdrew from negotiations over the amount of

 

tion.3°

 

compensation due following FertiNitro’s acqui

The Respondent’s actions in relation to the mandatory acquisition of FertiNitro’s assets
were lawful and did not constitute any breach of the Treaty. The evidence shows that the
Respondent’s actions surrounding the issuance of the Expropriation Decree and its
application were lawful and carried out by the Respondent in accordance with due process.
The Claimants’ efforts to seek compensation, therefore, must fail as a matter of liability
under the Treaty. Moreover, Venezuelan law provides more than adequate procedures to

compensate KOMSA. For all these reasons, the Tribunal should dismiss KOMSAs’ claim.

Expropriation — KNI: This claim is denied by the Respondent (in addition to its

jurisdictional objection). KNI asserts, wrongly, that KNI’s interest in the Offtake

Agreement was expropriated by the Respondent. The Offtake Agreement was a
commercial sales contract, by which Pequiven, IPSL and KNI agreed to purchase 100% of
FertiNitro’s production; it was not an “investment” by KNI; and it was not expropriated by

the Respondent.

As submitted in the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection, KNI’s claim flies in the face of
the well-settled principle that sales contracts do not constitute “investments” pursuant to
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention; and a commercial sales contract, such as the Offtake

Agreement, does not satisfy the definition of “investment” in the Treaty.

The Expropriation Decree did not address or cover the Offtake Agreement. The factual
evidence shows that the Offtake Agreement remained in effect for over 16 months after the
date when the Expropriation Decree was issued by the Respondent. Ultimately,
FertiNitro’s directors (not the Respondent) decided to terminate the Offtake Agreement on
28 February 2012. That decision was made for commercial reasons and was taken solely
by FertiNitro. In these circumstances, the Claimants’ claim that KNI’s interest in the

Offtake Agreement was expropriated by the Respondent must fail under the Treaty.

Compensation: In summary, in the event that the Tribunal determines that the
Respondent’s actions in relation to the mandatory acquisition of FertiNitro’s assets did
violate Article 6 of the Treaty, the Claimants are entitled only to the “fair market value” of
KOMSA’s interests in FertiNitro, as provided by both Venezuelan and international law.
Despite the clarity of Venezuelan and international law, the Claimants are seeking

substantially more than a “fair market value” in this arbitration.

Further, the Claimants have asserted several additional claims in this arbitration, for which
they argue they are entitled to extraordinary, unreasonable and unsupported amounts for
KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement and additional amounts as KOMSA’s “Historical
Losses” for the alleged breaches of Articles 4(1), 4(2), 6 and 11(2) of the Treaty. There is
no support for these claimed amounts; and the Claimants have failed to substantiate any

losses associated with those alleged breaches of the Treaty.

The Respondent concludes that the amount of compensation claimed by the Claimants in

this arbitration is obscenely overstated. The Treaty sets forth a precise and exhaustive

35

standard of compensation. Under this standard, the Claimants are entitled only to the “fair
market value” of KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro immediately before the issuance of the
Expropriation Decree on 11 October 2010. There is no legal basis to support the Claimants’
position that they are both entitled to some measure of punitive damages by virtue of the
allegedly unlawful nature of the Respondent’s acts. In particular, the amount the Claimants
seek in relation to the Expropriation Decree is grossly overstated; and the Claimants’ “fair

market value” calculations are wrongly predicated on untenable assumptions.

PART III: THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES

Introduction

The Tribunal lists below the six principal issues relevant to this Award. This list is not

exhaustive of all issues raised by the Parties in this arbitration.

The Principal Issues
Issue 1 — Jurisdiction: KNI and the Offtake Agreement (not KOMSA): This jurisdictional
issue arises under Articles 1(2) and 2 of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention. This jurisdictional issue is addressed in Part VI of the Award below.

Issue 2 — Factual Background: These factual matters are addressed principally in Part V
of this Award below, as also when addressing issues of jurisdiction, liability and

compensation in Parts VI, VII, VIII and Ix.

Issue 3: Liability: The issues of liability arise under Articles 4(1), 4(2), 6 and 11(2) of the
Treaty, as cited in Part IV of this Award. Liability for expropriation under Article 6 of the
Treaty, as regards KOMSA and KNI respectively, is addressed in Part VII of this Award
below. Liability under Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 11(2) of the Treaty, as regards KOMSA, is
addressed in Part VIII of this Award below.

Issue 4 — Compensation: This issue arises under the Treaty and, as submitted by the
Claimants, customary international law. As regards the former, Article 6 of the Treaty
provides, in material part: “*... Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the
investment expropriated immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became
public knowledge, whichever is earlier, shall include interest from the date of
expropriation, be paid without delay in a freely convertible currency to the person entitled
thereto and be freely transferable.” Compensation is addressed in Part IX of this Award

below.

Issue 5 — Interest: This issue arises under the Treaty and, as submitted by the Claimants,

under customary international law. As to the former, Article 6 of the Treaty provides, in

37

3.7

@
3.8

3.9

3.10

material part that compensation thereunder “shall include interest from the date of

expropriation.” Interest is addressed in Part XI of this Award below.

Issue 6 — Costs: The issue of legal and arbitration costs arises under Article 61(2) of the
ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1)(j) of ICSID Arbitration Rules. Costs are also addressed
in Part XI of this Award below.

Detailed Issues, Questions and Related Matters

During the arbitration, the Parties and (for the Third Hearing) also the Tribunal developed
successive lists of issues, questions and ancillary comments on related matters. These are
lengthy, repetitive and duplicate much of what already appears in a different form
elsewhere in this Award. Nevertheless, the schedule below served as a check-list of matters
that the Tribunal addressed during the Hearings and in arriving at its several decisions in
this Award. However, it has not been necessary for the Tribunal to decide all these matters.
Again, the schedule is not exhaustive of all detailed issues, questions and related matters

raised by the Parties during the arbitration.

* Schedule of Detailed Issues, Questions and Related Matters

Issue 1 — Jurisdiction: KNI and the Offtake Agreement

According to the Respondent, as already briefly summarised above, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to
address the claim made by KNI in respect of the Offtake Agreement. According to the Claimants, the Offtake
Agreement was an integral part of the FertiNitro Project; and KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement
qualifies as an “investment” under both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. The Claimants therefore take

issue with the Respondent's jurisdictional objection.

Issue 2 — Factual Background

According to the Claimants, three essential facts were and remain entirely unchallenged on the evidential
record adduced in this arbitration. First, the Respondent's ‘Apertura’ policy, and its other assurances,
precipitated the Claimants’ investments in Venezuela. Second, starting in 2005, the Respondent
progressively interfered with the Claimants’ investments. Third, on 11 October 2010, without any formal
notice, the Respondent openly and unambiguously expropriated both KOMSA’s equity interest in FertiNitro
and KNI's interest in the Offtake Agreement. There are thus, according to the Claimants, few (if any)

principal issues as to the factual background to the Parties’ dispute.

38

3.11

3.12

3.16

3.17

3.18

3.19

According to the Respondent, none of the facts alleged by the Claimants establish any breach of its

obligations under the Treaty. The Claimants are put to proof of their factual allegations to the contrary.
Issue 3: Liability

Expropriation: According to the Claimants, the Respondent breached Article 6 of the Treaty by unlawfully
expropriating KOMSA's interest in FertiNitro and KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement on 11 October
2010; and, to date, the Respondent has failed to compensate the Claimants for its expropriation of the

Claimants’ investments.

According to the Respondent, its mandatory acquisition of FertiNitro’s assets was lawful because the
Respondent complied with the requirements of Article 6 of the Treaty. Also according to the Respondent, it
did not mandatorily acquire the Offtake Agreement; FertiNitro terminated the Offtake Agreement in
February 2012 for commercial reasons; and FertiNitro’s decision to terminate the Offtake Agreement is not

attributable to the Respondent under international law.

FET: This issue of liability arises under Article 4(1) of the Treaty. It provides, in material part, that the
Respondent “shall provide, in accordance with the rules and principles of International Law, investments in
its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment [...]” (the “FET

standard”).

According to the Claimants, the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 4(1) to accord fair and
equitable treatment to the Claimants’ investments. According to the Respondent, it did not breach the FET
standard of Article 4(1) of the Treaty. The Respondent contends that this FET standard is tied to the minimum

standard of customary international law; and that the Claimants have failed to substantiate their claims.

FPS: This issue arises under Article 4(1) of the Treaty. It provides, in material part, that the Respondent:
“shall provide, in accordance with the rules and principles of International Law, investments in its territory

of investors of the other Contracting Party [..

 

full protection and security [...]” (the “FPS standard”).

According to the Claimants, the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 4(1) to accord full
protection and security to the Claimants’ investments. According to the Respondent, it complied with its
obligation under Article 4(1) to afford full protection and security: this FPS standard relates to physical injury

only; and the Respondent did not fail to protect KOMSA’s investment.

 

Interference: This issue also arises under Article 4(1) of the Treaty. It provides, in material part, that the
Respondent “shall [not] impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation,

use, enj . disposal or li of such i

According to the Claimants, the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 4(1) by putting in place

arbitrary and discriminatory measures that impaired KOMSA’s management, operation, use and enjoyment

39

3.20

3.22

3.23

3.24

3.25

of its investment. According to the Respondent, it did not impair the management, operation, use or
enjoyment of FertiNitro through any arbitrary or discriminatory measures. The Respondent submits that the
Claimants have misapplied the applicable standard; and the Claimants have provided a misleading account

of the Respondent’s actions to allege a breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty.

National Treatment: This issue arises under Article 4(2) of the Treaty. It provides, in material part: “The
treatment accorded by each Contracting Party to the investment by investors of the other Contracting Party
in its territory, or to the investors themselves as regards their investments, shall not be less favourable than
that accorded to investments of their own investors [...], or to the investors concerned as regards their

investments” (the “National Treatment standard”).

According to the Claimants, the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 4(2) to accord to the
Claimants and their investments treatment in accordance with the National Treatment standard. According
to the Respondent, it did not breach the National Treatment standard in Article 4(2) of the Treaty. The
Respondent submits that the Claimants have misapplied the applicable standard; and that it did not treat

Pequiven more favourably than KOMSA.

Umbrella Clause: This issue arises under Article 11(2) of the Treaty. It provides: “Each Contracting Party

 

shall observe any obligation it has assumed regarding the treatment of investments in its territory by investors

of the other Contracting Party” (the “Umbrella Clause”).

According to the Claimants, the Respondent failed to observe the obligations assumed in Article 11(2)
regarding the treatment of the Claimants’ investments. According to the Respondent, it has not breached

Article 11(2) of the Treaty, particularly because there were no such “obligations”.
Issue 4 — Compensation

In brief, the Claimants submit that the Respondent must pay full compensation under Article 6 of the Treaty
and international law for all their losses caused by the Respondent’s expropriatory and other non-
expropriatory violations of the Treaty (namely KOMSA’s “Historical Losses”). Such compensation for
KOMSA amounts to a total principal sum of US$ 444.6 million (calculated as at 30 January 2015). As to
KNI, such compensation amounts to a total principal sum of US$ 227.8 million (calculated as at 30 January

2015).

In brief, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ quantification of their damages must be rejected by the
Tribunal, for several reasons. First, the Respondent contends that the compensation claimed by KOMSA and
KNI is vastly overstated. Second, it submits that the relevant standard of compensation is to be found in the
Treaty (not in customary international law). Third, the Respondent contends that KOMSA’s alleged

“Historical Losses” are unfounded.

Issue 5 — Interest

The Claimants submit that they are they are entitled to compound interest on any sums awarded by the

Tribunal. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ claims for compound interest are ill-founded.
Issue 6 — Costs

The Claimants seek an order requiring the Respondent to pay the costs of the arbitration, including all the
fees and expenses of ICSID and the Tribunal and all the legal costs and expenses incurred by the Claimants,
apportioned as between the Claimants in the ratio in which they are awarded compensation. The Respondent
seeks an order requiring the Claimants to bear all costs and fees incurred in this arbitration, including the

Respondent's reasonable attorney’s fees and expert fees.
The Third (June) Hearing

For the purpose of the Third (June) Hearing before the reconstituted Tribunal, so as to allow the Parties to
prepare in full their respective oral submissions, the Tribunal sent to the Parties a non-exhaustive check-list
of issues on 16 May 2016 and later a further list of issues on 2 June 2016, taken from the Parties’ own

pleadings. These documents are set out successively below, in relevant part.

*The Check-List of 16 May 2016 (in Three Parts)

* Part I (from the Claimants’ pleaded case):

Claimants’ Issue 1 - Jurisdiction:

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction over KNI’s claim is clear, because:

A. The Offtake Agreement was an integral part of the FertiNitro Project;

B. KNI’s rights under the Offtake Agreement qualify as an “investment” under both the ICSID Convention

and the Treaty (and satisfy the non-jurisdictional indicia), because:

(i) The Offtake Agreement is an “investment” under the ICSID Convention;

(ii) The Offtake Agreement is an “investment” under the Treaty; and

(iii) In any event the Offtake Agreement also satisfies the non-jurisdictional indicia.

Claimants’ Issue 2 - The Principal Facts: The oral testimony at the First (September) Hearing confirmed the

central tenets of the Claimants’ case and materially undermined the Respondent’s Case, because:

4l

3.32

A. The essential facts remain entirely unchallenged on the evidential record in this arbitration, as listed under

B, C and D below.

B. The Respondent's “Apertura” policy, with its other assurances, precipitated the Claimants’ investment in

Venezuela.
C. Starting in 2005, the Respondent progressively interfered with the Claimants’ investments.

D. On 10/11 October 2010, without any formal notice, the Respondent openly and unambiguously
expropriated both KOMSA’s equity in FertiNitro and KNI’s rights under the Offtake Agreement.

E. The First (September) Hearing showed that the Respondent's claim (that it never expropriated the Offtake

Agreement) is a study in contradiction, because

(i) If the Respondent did not expropriate the Offtake Agreement, as it claims, then it could not have had a

legitimate purpose for the expropriation of FertiNitro;
(ii) The Respondent always planned to take KNI’s offtake; and

(iii) The Urea Decree and the Urea Resolution already guaranteed the Respondent access to FertiNitro’s

product at significantly below production cost.

F. The First (September) hearing confirmed that Pequiven was, at all relevant times, an agent of the

Respondent.
Claimants’ Issue 3 - Liability: The Respondent's conduct violated the Treaty:

A. Expropriation: The Respondent breached Article 6 of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating KOMSA's
equity in FertiNitro and KNI’s rights under the Offtake Agreement:

(i) The Respondent’s expropriation of the Claimants’ investments was not carried out in the public interest;

(ii) The Respondent’s expropriation of the Claimants’ investments was carried out in a discriminatory

manner;

(iii) The Respondent's expropriation of the Claimants’ investments was not carried out under due process of

law; and

(iv) To date, the Respondent has failed to compensate the Claimants for its direct expropriation of the

Claimants’ investments.

B. FET: The Respondent breached its duty under Article 4(1) of the Treaty to accord fair and equitable

treatment to the Claimants’ investments.

42

3.33

C. FPS: The Respondent breached its duty under Article 4(1) of the Treaty to accord full protection and

security to the Claimants’ investments.

D. Impairment: The Respondent breached Article 4(1) of the Treaty by putting in place arbitrary and
discriminatory measures that impaired the Claimants’ management, operation, use and enjoyment of its

investments.

E. National Treatment: The Respondent breached its duty under Article 4(2) of the Treaty to accord national

treatment to the Claimants’ investments.

F. Umbrella Clause: The Respondent breached its obligations assumed under Article 11(2) of the Treaty

regarding the treatment of the Claimants’ investments.

Claimants’ Issue 4 - Compensation:

A. The Claimants have demonstrated that the Respondent must pay full compensation under international

law:

(i) Recent jurisprudence confirms that the Respondent must pay full compensation to the Claimants in a “but

for” scenario for the illegal expropriation of their investments;

 

(ii) KOMSA is also entitled to full compensation under international law for the los caused by the

Respondent's ‘other (non-expropriation) violations’ of the Treaty; and
(iii) KOMSA is entitled to compensation for its ‘Historical Losses’.

B. Testimony from the First (September) Hearing demonstrated that the Parties’ quantum experts have

adopted fundamentally different approaches to the valuation exercise:

(i) Mr Giles’s valuation (for the Claimants) is supported by contemporaneous documentary evidence and the

testimony of the only independent fertiliser industry expert in this arbitration (Mr Sanders); and

(ii) Dr Flores’s valuation (for the Respondent) is a coalescence of (i) a series of assertions that are either
outside the evidential record or are beyond his expertise; and (ii) a mechanical averaging of data and sources

without any appreciation of the contemporaneous and industry evidence.

C. Whilst the Parties’ quantum experts agree on a number of compensation parameters, their outstanding

differences of fact and expertise on quantum issues remain significant.

Claimants’ Issue 5 - Compound Interest: The Claimants have demonstrated that they are entitled to

compound interest.

A. The Treaty confirms that compound interest is payable;

43

B. The last five years of ICSID jurisprudence (on the record of these proceedings) confirms that compound

interest is payable; and

C. Leading commentaries confirm that compound interest is payable.

* Part II (from the Respondent's pleaded case):

Respondent’s Issue 1 - Jurisdiction: The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the claims relating to the Offtake

Agreement, because:

A. The Offtake Agreement is a sales contract that does not constitute an “investment” within the meaning of

the Treaty or Article 25 of the ICSID Convention:
(i) Sales Contracts are not investments under international law; and

(ii) Complexity, length, project finance implications or the general unity of investment concept do not

transform the Offtake Agreement into an investment.

B. KNI has neither made a contribution nor incurred the type of risk necessary to qualify as an investment

under the Treaty or under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, because:

(i) The Term “investment” has an objective and inherent meaning under both the Treaty and the ICSID

Convention, which requires the assumption of an investment risk and the making of a contribution; and

(ii) KNI has not incurred an investment risk in connection with the Offtake Agreement.

C. The Offtake Agreement does not have a territoriality nexus with the Republic of Venezuela to qualify for

protection under the Treaty.

Respondent’s Issue 2 - Expropriation: The Respondent did not mandatorily acquire the Offtake Agreement,

because:

A. The Offtake Agreement granted KNI a right to purchase FertiNitro’s product;

B. Decree 7713 did not order the mandatory acquisition of KNI’s rights under the Offtake Agreement or of

the Offtake Agreement itself;

C. KNI continued to purchase offtake under the Offtake Agreement until February 2012;

D. FertiNitro terminated the Offtake Agreement in February 2012 for commercial reasons; and

E. FertiNitro’s decision to terminate the Offtake Agreement is not attributable to the Respondent.

Respondent’s Issue 3 - Expropriation: The mandatory acquisition of FertiNitro’s assets was lawful; and the

Respondent complied with the requirements of Article 6 of the Treaty, because.

44

3.38

A. The Respondent's acquisition of FertiNitro’s ts was in the public interest:

 

(i) The Respondent should be afforded ample deference regarding its public interest policies; and

(ii) The mandatory acquisition of FertiNitro’s assets was carried out pursuant to the public policy of food

security.

B. The mandatory acquisition of FertiNitro’s assets was carried out in a non-discriminatory manner, because:

(i) Pequiven/IPSL and KOMSA/KNI were not similarly situated;

(ii) KOMSA did not receive differential treatment; and

(iii) Any differential treatment was not improper because it was based on a reasonable justification.

C. The Respondent's actions were carried out under the process of law, because:

(i) “Advance Notice” is not a requirement of due process under the Treaty or international law; and

(ii) The Respondent repeatedly provided notice to KOMSA that it planned to take control of FertiNitro.

D. The Respondent met (and continues to meet) its payment obligation under Article 6 of the Treaty, because:

(i) Article 6 of the Treaty requires the Respondent to make a reasonable offer of compensation — not

immediate payment;

(ii) The Respondent made a reasonable offer of compensation, which KOMSA rejected; and

(iii) The Respondent will compensate KOMSA through the Mandatory Acquisition Procedure.

Respondent’s Issue 4 - FET: The Respondent did not breach the FET standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty,

because:

A. The applicable standard is tied to the minimum standard of customary international law;

B. The Claimants have failed to substantiate their claims, because:

(i) The Claimants have failed to establish that they had any legitimate expectations in relation to the

Respondent's tax regime;

(ii) The Respondent has provided FertiNitro with VAT Credits in line with the Respondent's obligations;

(iii) The Respondent did not interfere in the management and operations of FertiNitro;

(iv) The Respondent did not frustrate any legitimate expectation by issuing the Urea Decree and Urea

Resolution; and

45

3.40

(v) The Respondent provided a stable and predictable legal and business environment, treated the Claimants

with transparency and procedural fairness and did not abuse its authority.

Respondent’s Issue 5 - FPS: The Respondent complied with its obligation under Article 4 of the Treaty to

afford full protection and security, because:
A. The FPS standard relates to physical injury.
B. The Respondent did not fail to protect KOMSA’s investment.

dent’s Issue 6 - Inter irment: The did not impair the management, operation,

use or enjoyment of FertiNitro through arbitrary or discriminatory measures under Article 4(1) of the Treaty,

because:

‘A. The Claimants have misapplied the applicable standard; and

B. The Claimants have also provided a misleading account of the Respondent’s actions that are alleged to

have breached Article 4(1) of the Treaty.

Respondent’s Issue 7 - National Treatment: The Respondent did not breach the National Treatment standard

under Article 4(2) of the Treaty, because:

A. The Claimants have misapplied the applicable standard; and

B. The Respondent did not treat Pequiven more favourably than KOMSA.

Respondent's Issue 8 - Umbrella Clause: The Respondent did not breach Article 11 (2) of the Treaty.

Respondent’s Issue 9 - Compensation: The Tribunal must reject the Claimants’ quantification of damages,

because:

A. The compensation claimed by KOMSA and KNI is vastly overstated:

(i) The relevant standard of compensation is found in the Treaty, not in customary international law;

(ii) Irrespective of the legal standard for compensation, the Parties agree that the expert witnesses on

compensation should apply the Fair Market Value (FMV) standard; and

(iii) The Claimants ultimately fail to apply the FMV standard.

B. The Fair Market Value (FMV) of KOMSA’s economic interest in FertiNitro was no more than US$ 34.6

million:

(i) While Dr Flores’ DCF valuation is reasonable, Mr Giles’ DCF analysis is overstated and does not reflect

FertiNitro’s FMV because:

46

  

a. The Claimants’ DCF analysis is inconsistent and highly speculative;

b. The Claimants’ DCF valuation inappropriately excludes actual production volumes from 2009 and 2010

in projecting future production:

(1) The Claimants inappropriately project a three-year turnaround cycle for FertiNitro;

(2) The number of gas and electricity disruptions and unplanned shutdowns in 2009 and 2010 was not

materially higher than in recent prior years;

(3) The Claimants’ position that a hypothetical buyer would believe FertiNitro could consistently achieve

nameplate production levels is unfounded;

(4) The Claimants’ position that the exclusion of the 2009-2010 period is justified by law is entirely baseless;
c. The Claimants’ projections of FertiNitro’s future costs are understated:

(1) The Claimants unreasonably relied upon budgeted instead of actual turnaround and maintenance costs;
(2) The Claimants’ other cost estimates are also understated.

d. The Claimants’ proposed discount rate is understated:

(1) The Claimants’ reliance upon out-dated global market risk premium data is unreasonable and

inappropriate;

(2) The Claimants inappropriately relied upon limited survey data to determine their base country risk rate;

(3) The Claimants inappropriately excluded political risk from their country risk rate;

(4) The Claimants’ calculation of a 0.40 lambda for FertiNitro is entirely arbitrary and unreasonable;

(5) The Claimants’ application of a 1% liquidity discount is contrary to basic valuation principles; and

(6) The unreasonableness of the Claimants’ discount rate is confirmed by the two ExxonMobil awards and

the Flughafen Ziirich award.

(ii) The Claimants’ “Reasonableness Checks” do not support their valuation of KOMSA’s 25% Share in

FertiNitro:

a. The October 2008 MOU Price, if properly adjusted, confirms Dr Flores’ valuation;

b. Construction costs of other plants are irrelevant;

c. The Advantis Reports confirm Dr Flores’ valuation;

47

3.46

3.48

3.49

d. The Claimants’ ‘new argument’ based on FertiNitro’s book value is irrelevant.

C. The Claimants’ valuation of the Offtake Agreement is overstated, because:

(i) The Claimants make the same inappropriate assumptions regarding sales volumes and discount rate as in

their valuation of KOMSA’s equity interest in FertiNitro.

(ii) The Claimants’ valuation period improperly includes a 16-month period during which KNI suffered no

losses.

(iii) The Claimants use the wrong valuation methodology based on unrealistic factual assumptions, because:

a. The Claimants inappropriately calculate KNI’s lost profits rather than the value of KNI’s alleged rights

under the Offtake Agreement;

b. The Claimants fail to prove that they would have been unable to replace the FertiNitro Offtake through

purchase on the open market;

c. The Claimants’ lost profits calculations are flawed and highly speculative.

D. The Claimants’ alleged “Historical Losses” are unfounded.

Respondent’s Issue 10 - Interest: The Claimants’ claims for compound interest are ill-founded.

Respondent’s Issue 11 - Costs: The Claimants’ claims for costs are denied.

* Part III: Specific Further Queries (by the Tribunal)

The Parties were invited by the Tribunal to summarise at the Third (June) Hearing their respective cases on

the relationship between the Offtake Agreement and the FertiNitro Project.

The Parties were requested to summarise their respective cases on whether or not the Offtake Agreement

satisfies the legal and economic characteristics of an investment under the Treaty.

The Parties were requested to summarise the evidence regarding the impact of Decree 7713 on KNI’s rights

under the Offtake Agreement.

The Parties were requested to summarise their respective cases on the attribution under the Treaty or

otherwise to the Respondent of FertiNitro’s decision to terminate the Offtake Agreement.

48

3.51

3.54

3.50.2 What has happened with actual and projected natural gas price, since the last submissions by the

Parties on this subject?

3.50.3. Why should the “expected rate of return” on equities rather than the “required rate of return” be

used for the determination of the market risk premium?

3.50.4 Taking into account the fact that sales of product to KNI, after an interruption between October
2010 and January 2011, started again in January 2011 until the termination of the Offtake
Agreement in February 2012, how much money, if any, did KNI lose compared to the continuing

operation of that Offtake Agreement?

3.50.5 Would the Parties elaborate on their respective views concerning the relevance to this case (if any)
of the discount rates used in the two ExxonMobil awards and in the Flughafen and Gold Reserve
awards and the Advantis Report of May 2011, referred to by the Parties in their respective

submissions?

3.50.6 What is the relevance, if any, of the Booz Allen valuation of FertiNitro made in 2007?

*The Tribunal’s Additional Topics of 2 June 2016 for the Parties
A. Offtake Agreement

on 28 February 2012 (assuming, arguendo, that it was not terminated earlier by the Expropriation Decree

etc)? If so, what sovereign powers were relied upon and by whom?

Topic A4: Did KNI respond to Mr Betulio Hernandez’s letter of 28 February 2012 (Exhibit C-114)? Was

PART IV: THE PRINCIPAL LEGAL TEXTS

() Introduction

41 It is necessary to cite in full several of the relevant legal texts at the outset of this Award,
for ease of reference elsewhere. This is not to suggest that, to decide the legal issues in
dispute between the Parties, the Tribunal may be limited to the sources identified herein or
otherwise invoked by the Parties. To the contrary, the Tribunal agrees with the following

statement of the Daimler v. Argentina ad hoc committee*’:

“This Committee is of the view that an arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to
or relying upon only the authorities cited by the parties. It can, sua sponte, rely on
other publicly available authorities, even if they have not been cited by the parties,
provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the parties were
provided an opportunity to address it. [...]. Once such an opportunity was provided
the Tribunal was not obliged to confine itself to only those authorities, which had
been cited by the parties. No rule of law or procedure or requirement of due process
prevented it from referring to or relying upon other authorities that were in the public
domain. Such reliance did not violate any rule of natural justice including the right
to be heard.”

42 Where the original text is Spanish, the Tribunal here cites the English translation, as noted.

(2) The Switzerland-Venezuela Treaty*

43 Article 1(1) of the Treaty defines “investors” for purposes of the Treaty as follows:
“The Term “investor” refers with regard to either Contracting Party to:

a) natural persons who, according to the law of that Contracting Party, are
considered to be its nationals;

b) legal entities, including companies, corporations, business associations and
other organizations which are constituted or otherwise duly organised under the
law of that Contracting Party;

January 2015), Paragraph 295.

38 Agreement between the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of Venezuela on the Reciprocal Promotion and
Protection of Investments (18 November 1993) (CLA-1).

52

c) legal entities not established under the law of that Contracting Party but
effectively controlled by natural persons as defined in (a) above or by legal
entities as defined in (b) above.”

44 Article 1(2) of the Treaty defines the term “investment” as follows:

“The term ‘investment’ comprises every kind of asset and more particularly, though
not exclusively:

a) movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem;

b) shares, parts or any other kinds of participation in a company;

c) claims to money or to any performance under a contract;

d) intellectual property rights, technical processes, know-how and goodwill;

e) concessions and other rights granted under public law.”

45 Article 2 of the Treaty provides:

“The present Agreement shall apply to investments in the territory of one Contracting
Party made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the other
Contracting Party, whether prior to or after the entry into force of the Agreement. It
shall, however, not be applicable to divergencies or disputes the causes of which have

arisen prior to its entry into force.”
4.6 Article 4(1) of the Treaty provides:

“Each Contracting Party shall provide, in accordance with the rules and principles
of International Law, investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting
Party fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security; neither of them
shall impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion, disposal or liquidation of such

investments.”
AT Article 4(2) of the Treaty provides:

“The treatment accorded by each Contracting Party to the investment by investors
of the other Contracting Party in its territory, or to the investors themselves as
regards their investments, shall not be less favourable than that accorded to
investments of their own investors or those of any third State, or to the investors
concerned as regards their investments.”

53

48

49

Article 6 of the Treaty provides:

“Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly, measures
of expropriation, nationalization or any other measures having the same nature or
the same effect against investments of investors of the other Contracting Party, unless
the measures are taken in the public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis, and
under due process of law, and provided that provisions be made for effective and
adequate compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the
investment expropriated immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or
became public knowledge, whichever is earlier, shall include interest from the date
of expropriation, be paid without delay in a freely convertible currency to the person
entitled thereto and be freely transferable.”

 

Article 9 of the Treaty provides:

“(1) With a view to an amicable solution of disputes between a Contracting Party
and an investor of the other Contracting Party consultations will take place between
the parties concerned.
(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months from the date
of the request for consultations, the investor may submit the dispute to the arbitration
of the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (I.C.S.I.D.)
d by the C ion on the l of inves lis between States
and nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington, on 18th March,
1965.
(3) As an alternative to I.C.S.1.D. arbitration the parties to the dispute may, by mutual
consent, have recourse to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal which unless otherwise agreed
upon by the parties to the dispute shall be established under the arbitration rules of
the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (U.N.C.1.T.R.A.L.). Such
arbitration shall in any case take place if for whatever reason I.C.S.I.D. arbitration
is not available.
(4) The arbitral award shall limit itself to determine whether the Contracting Party
concerned has failed to comply with an obligation under this Agreement, whether
such failure has resulted in damages to the investor, and, if this is the case, the
amount to be paid by the Contracting Party to the investor as compensation for such
damages.
(5) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an investment
dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this article.
(6) The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not at any time during
the procedures, assert as a defence its immunity or the fact that the investor has
received compensation under an insurance contract covering the whole or part of the
incurred damage or loss.

 

54

(7) The arbitral award shall be final and binding for the parties involved in the
dispute.”

4.10 Article 11(2) of the Treaty provides:

“Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it has assumed regarding the
treatment of investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.”

obligation to tender Product to a Buyer and such Buyer fails to take delivery of
its allocation of Products in accordance with Articles II, V or VI (“Non-Taking
Buyer”) within thirty (30) days after the scheduled delivery date therefor, such
Non-Taking Buyer shall nevertheless pay Seller (i) the corresponding price,
determined in accordance with the applicable formula in Section 3.1(a) or

such Products tendered by Seller but not taken by such Non-Taking Buyer and
(ii) all costs and expenses of Seller in the event that the Non-Taking Buyer’s

quantities of Products not tendered or not taken by reason of a Force Majeure
Event and (z) quantities of Products not tendered by reason of non-performance
by Seller in accordance with the terms of this Agreement except to the extent such
non-performance was attributable to the Non-Taking Buyer.

(b) Products Not Taken. Seller shall promptly give notice of any Non-Taking Buyer’s

failure to take any Product to the other Buyer so long as such other Buyer is

purchase any Product not taken by the Non-Taking Buyer, for resale or [sic] its
own consumption, at the corresponding Product price determined pursuant to
Section 3.1. (a) or (b), as the case may be, and upon acceptance, the obligations

sales costs that Seller incurred to sell the Product), such credit to be applied by
Seller against future invoices issued by the Seller to the relevant Buyer.

(c) Modification of Certain Provisions Upon Repayment of Loans. N ith lis

loans made by the lenders to Seller under the Loan Agreements, including any
refinancing thereof, each Buyer’s obligation to take-or-pay for Product if
tendered under Section 3.2(a) above shall terminate, and the modifications to this
Agreement set forth in Exhibit B shall be effective for all purposes hereunder as
of such date.

3.3. Income Taxes. Except as specifically provided in Section 3.1(f), each Buyer shall

claimed against such Buyer based on or measured against such Buyer’s income

(including penalties, interest and expenses) imposed by any jurisdiction or political

subdivision thereof or therein (other than the Republic of Venezuela or any

Venezuelan state or local governmental or taxing authority therein) arising out of or

relating to the sale of Products hereunder or the performance by Buyer of its

obligation hereunder, whether or not such taxes were correctly or legally assessed.”

4.15 Article 11.1 of the Offtake Agreement provides:

“Term of Agreement — Subject to the terms and conditions herein, this Agreement
shall be effective as of the date first written above and shall run for a primary term
of twenty (20) Contract Years thereafter (“Primary Term”); provided, however, in
the event that the Bonds have not been fully paid or redeemed and remain outstanding
under their original repayment schedule upon the conclusion of the Primary Term,
neither of the Buyers not the Seller shall cancel this Agreement and the Primary Term
shall be extended for such period of time as the Bonds remain outstanding under their
original repayment schedule. This Agreement shall be automatically renewed
following the Primary Term for one or more successive terms of five (5) Contract
Years (each a “Secondary Term”) unless one of the Parties gives written notice to
the contrary to the other Parties at least six (6) months prior to the end of the Primary
Term or the then current Secondary Term, as appropriate. If this Agreement is
renewed for one or more Secondary Terms, the Parties shall consult with each other
at least three (3) months prior to the commencement of any such Secondary Term to

determine whether, under the circumstances then prevailing, the provisions of
Section 2.3 shall apply.”

Article 12.2 of the Offtake Agreement provides:

“(a) Arbitration Pursuant to ICC Rules. If the Dispute has not been resolved through
negotiation within ninety (90) days after the date of the notice of Dispute received
pursuant to Section 12.1, the Dispute shall be finally settled and resolved by
arbitration in accordance with the ICC Rules, subject to such modifications of the

PART V: THE PRINCIPAL FACTS

Introduction

The Parties’ principal dispute relates to the alleged expropriation by the Respondent of (i)
KOMSA’s twenty-five per cent (25%) indirect equity interest in FertiNitro, a joint venture
project comprising several legal entities, established by three private shareholders
(including KOMSA) and Pequiven, the Venezuelan State-owned petrochemical company;
and (ii) KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement between (inter alios) FertiNitro, Pequiven
and KNI. FertiNitro was engaged in the production and sale of nitrogen fertilisers
(ammonia and urea) through the operation and maintenance of four petrochemical plants

at José in Venezuela (also described collectively as the “FertiNitro Plant’).

The FertiNitro project originated in 1998; and the plants commenced commercial
operations in 2001. FertiNitro’s plants encountered several technical and operational
difficulties. These led to an international commercial arbitration between FertiNitro and
the project’s EPC contractor and minority shareholder, Snamprogetti. The Parties disagree

as to the causes and consequences of the Plants’ operational and technical difficulties.

Venezuela’s food production and agriculture have been marked by underdevelopment
since the 1990s. In response, the Respondent developed a policy to attain greater food
security for the people of Venezuela, which included, amongst others matters, laws and
regulations to secure State control over the domestic production of food and food-related

products, including fertilizer for domestic agriculture.

On 11 October 2010, the Respondent’s Expropriation Decree 7,713 dated 10 October 2010,
declaring the compulsory acquisition of the assets of FertiNitro, came into effect. KOMSA
did not receive any compensation for the expropriation of its indirect equity interest in

FertiNitro.

The Tribunal includes below in chronological order certain principal facts relevant to its
several decisions in regard to the Claimants’ two claims for expropriation under Article 6

of the Treaty and to KOMSA’s “Historical Claims” under Articles 4 and 11 of the Treaty.

66

Accordingly, notwithstanding an element of repetition later in this Award, this chronology
is not an exhaustive account of all factual issues in dispute between the Parties. The
Tribunal has nonetheless considered the evidence in full, as adduced by the Parties in this

lengthy arbitration.

5.6 This chronology addresses, as found by the Tribunal on the materials adduced by the
Parties: (i) the development of the FertiNitro project; (ii) the construction and operation of
the FertiNitro Plant; (iii) Pequiven’s negotiations to buy-out FertiNitro’s private
shareholders (including KOMSA); (iv) Venezuela’s legal and regulatory framework
leading to the Expropriation Decree dated 10 October 2010; (v) the events following the
Expropriation Decree; and (vi) certain other measures taken by the Respondent which, so

the Claimants allege, have interfered with their investments in violation of the Treaty.

(2) _ Factual Chronology
(i) | The Development of the FertiNitro Project

5.7 In the 1990s, Venezuela (as also certain other countries in Latin America) pursued
economic policies that sought, among other matters, to attract foreign investment and
reduce State control over important economic sectors. In the case of Venezuela, such

policies covered the petrochemical and hydrocarbon sector.*°

5.8 By the end of the 1990s, Venezuela imported more than 64% of its food and agricultural
products;*7 it had a surplus of non-commercialised natural gas, deriving from its petroleum

reserves; and it sought to develop its petrochemical sector.**

10). See also Cls. Mem., Paragraph 25; Resp. C-Mem., Paragraph 31, citing R-44. As part of their effort to attract
foreign investment to Venezuela, PDVSA and Pequiven participated in promotional conferences on the

I sector: See F ical Industry in Venez Ope ty (Caracas, la 8, 9,
and 10 of April 1997, Hotel Tamanaco Intercontinental (C-15), p. 6.

5.9 Pequiven, KOMSA,*? Snamprogetti Netherlands BV, a company organized under the laws
of the Netherlands, (“Snamprogetti”), and Polar Uno CA, a company organized under the
laws of Venezuela (“Polar”) entered into a series of agreements as “Owners” for the
development, construction and operation of two ammonia and two urea plants, to be located
in an industrial complex in the Venezuelan State of Anzdategui, in the northeast of the
country (the “FertiNitro project”). Ammonia and urea are nitrogen-based fertilisers that
are used to increase productivity and crop yield in agriculture.°° Ammonia is required to

produce urea; and therefore “ammonia is the basic building block of the nitrogen

fertilizer industry.”>!

5.10 On 8 April 1998, the Owners concluded the Joint Investors Agreement (the “JIA”),
providing for the incorporation and capitalisation of four interrelated Venezuelan
companies,™ organised in an investment structure through which the Owners would own,
construct and operate the FertiNitro Project.** As already indicated above, these four
interrelated Venezuelan companies are described as the “FertiNitro Companies” or

collectively as “FertiNitro”.

5.11 On that same day, in accordance with the JIA, FertiNitro Venezuela CEC, Pequiven,

International Petrochemical Sales Limited (“IPSL”, a subsidiary of Pequiven) and

4° Koch Oil S.A was incorporated in Switzerland on 24 January 1972. On 11 April 2003, Koch Oil S.A. changed its
name to Koch Minerals S.A. See Extract from the Commerce Register of the Canton of Fribourg, Report (30 June
1999) (C-2), and on 2009, the company changed its corporate form to Koch Minerals Sarl, one of the Claimants in
this case. See Request for Registration in the Commercial Register of the Canton of Fribourg (20 March 2009) (C-
3). For ease of reference, the company under its different denominations and corporate forms is referred to in this
Award as “KOMSA.”

5! Flérez WS1, Paragraph 6. According to the Respondent, “Approximately 67% of the ammonia produced by
FertiNitro is used to make urea.” “Ammonia is made by combining nitrogen and hydrogen with the use of catalysts,
high heat, and elevated pressure. Air is the main source of the nitrogen. Natural gas is the most commonly used
source of hydrogen.” See also Resp. C-Mem., Paragraphs 52, 54.

» Pursuant to the JIA, the joint investors acknowledged and agreed that certain agreements were “necessary to give
effect to [the JIA], and w[ould] be executed and delivered on or following the Effective Date” including, among
others, the EPC Contract, the financing agreements, the Equity Contribution Agreement and the Offtake Agreement.

KOMSA (later succeeded by KNI as described below) concluded the Offtake Agreement.*>
Pursuant to the Offtake Agreement, Koch and Pequiven/IPSL (the “Offtakers”) agreed to
purchase on a “take or pay” basis a guaranteed quantity of ammonia and urea produced by
FertiNitro at a discounted set price,®° for the Offtakers’ own consumption or resale in both
the local and export markets, for a 20-year term.*’ The Offtake Agreement could be
“automatically renewed” thereafter for five-year terms, unless otherwise notified by any of

the parties to the Offtake Agreement.>*

5.12 On30June 2000, KOMSA assigned its rights and obligations under the Offtake Agreement
to Koch Oil Marketing S.A. On 3 April 2003 Koch Oil Marketing S.A. assigned its rights
under the Offtake Agreement to KNI.?

5.13 The Offtake Agreement gave to Pequiven/IPSL the exclusive right to market and sell
ammonia and urea domestically, as also in South America, Central America and the
Caribbean. Pequiven’s sales to the local domestic market were not to exceed 10% of its
total volume of purchased product with FertiNitro. That percentage rose to 15% in 2004
and further 1% per year thereafter.©° KOMSA (later KNI) had the exclusive selling rights
for North America, including Mexico. Each of KOMSA/KNI and Pequiven/IPSL bought
approximately 50% of FertiNitro’s total production of urea and ammonia in any given

month.°!

5.14 In addition to the JIA and Offtake Agreement, numerous contracts were concluded in

connection with the FertiNitro project.°* These included the Engineering, Procurement

55 See Offtake Agreement by and among Pequiven, IPSL and Koch Oil SA as Buyers and FertiNitro as Seller (8 April
1998) (“Offtake Agreement”) (C-19).

56 The pricing was advantageous for the Offtakers. The purchase price for ammonia was based on published prices for
ammonia less a 4% “Ammonia Marketing Fee Discount”, and the purchase price for urea was based on published
prices for urea less a 3% “Urea Marketing Fee Discount”.

and Construction Contract by and between, FertiNitro, CEC, and Snamprogetti for the
“turn-key” construction by Snamprogetti of the ammonia and urea plants (the “EPC
Contract”),° as well as agreements for the supply of gas, electricity and water, among
many others.©* Under these gas agreements, FertiNitro received gas from PDVSA at

preferential prices.

As already indicated, FertiNitro was 35% owned by KOMSA, 35% owned by Pequiven,
20% owned by Snamprogetti and 10% owned by Polar, in accordance with the terms of the
Joint Investors’ Agreement (the “JIA”).© KOMSA held its interest in FertiNitro through
Koch José, a company organised under the laws of the Cayman Islands. KOMSA
transferred 28.571% of its equity in Koch José on 18 February 1998, to the Latin American
Infrastructure Fund (“LAIF”).°” As a result, KOMSA and LAIF indirectly owned 25% and
10% of FertiNitro, respectively.

The FertiNitro project included a project finance lending structure where the lenders
“receive[d] a security interest in the project’s cash flow and assets”;® and such lenders and
bondholders looked to the assets and income stream of the project for repayment. Under
this structure, “the project’s debt [was] secured by the receivables owed by Koch
[KOMSA] and Pequiven to FertiNitro under the Offtake Agreement”.” In accordance
with this financing structure, the Offtake Agreement was to remain in effect for a period

equal to the length of FertiNitro’s financing obligations and at least 20 years.”

5.17 FertiNitro was organised as a commercial enterprise; and its management was undertaken
through a nine-member board of directors of the FertiNitro Companies.’! After the transfer
of shares to LAIF, FertiNitro’s board of directors was composed of three directors
appointed by Pequiven, two directors appointed by KOMSA, two directors appointed by
Snamprogetti, one director appointed by LAIF and one director appointed by Polar.’”? The
chairman of the board of directors (who also served as President of FertiNitro) alternated
between an appointee of either KOMSA or Pequiven, for a two-year term or as otherwise
agreed by KOMSA and Pequiven.”? According to Clauses 5.4.1 and 5.4.2 of the JIA,
decisions of FertiNitro’s board and shareholders decisions could only be taken with the
majority approval from each of the representatives of Pequiven, KOMSA and

Snamprogetti.

(ii) The Construction and Functioning of the FertiNitro Plant

5.18 1998-2001: The construction of the FertiNitro Plant began in 1998 and the Plant

commenced commercial production in May 2001.4

minimum “nameplate” capacity of 1800 metric tons (“MT”); and each of the urea plants
had a nameplate capacity of 2,200 MT.” The total cost of the project was US$ 1.1 billion,
of which over US$ 740 million was funded by bonds and loans from a consortium

of banks.’°

equipment and operations.’? From 2002 onwards, FertiNitro experienced shutdowns for
repairs and maintenance issues. FertiNitro started withholding payments due to

Snamprogetti in its capacity as EPC contractor.

In 2002 Snamprogettti commenced an arbitration under the EPC before the International
Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce, against FertiNitro (the
“ICC Construction Arbitration”), claiming payment of the sums withheld by FertiNitro.
FertiNitro advanced counterclaims based on Snamprogetti’s alleged breach of warranties
in the EPC related to the design, construction and engineering of the Plant. FertiNitro and
Snamprogetti settled the arbitration on 14 December 2004. The settlement included (inter
alia) the forgiveness of certain debts owed by FertiNitro to Snamprogetti and a cash

payment by Snamprogetti to FertiNitro of US$ 6.5 million.”

2004-2009: The Parties disagreed on the working conditions of the FertiNitro Plant after
the settlement of the ICC Construction Arbitration and FertiNitro’s corresponding repairs
to the Plant. The Claimants assert that: “following the settlement [...] in late 2004, and
after the necessary construction repairs were made, the plant’s performance significantly
improved”;” and that “by 2006, it was achieving 98 percent of the previously anticipated

production levels. The Respondent alleges that many critical repairs remained

outstanding as more than one third of the critical issues identified by the 2003 Report of

5.24 From 2006, there was a clear downturn in production levels.*° The Parties however
disagree as to the causes. According to the Claimants, the operational problems are related
to “the repeated failures of PDVSA Gas and Pequiven to supply the contracted levels of
gas and electricity to the plant, combined with Respondent’s increased interference with
and distraction of the management of the plant.”*’ For its part, the Respondent admits that
there were problems in the supply of raw materials;** but it adds that FertiNitro’s
operational issues “have their roots” in the plant’s construction and design flaws

attributable to the EPC Contractor.”

5.25 FertiNitro was also subjected to and failed a “reliability test”, and thereafter continued to
experience planned and unplanned shutdowns, relating among others to mechanical
failures. In between these tests, FertiNitro underwent “turnarounds.” A “turnaround” is
a scheduled period of down time in which all production in a plant is stopped; and catalysts
and raw materials are removed. FertiNitro had its first turnaround in 2005. Thereafter,
turnarounds took place in 2008, 2009 and 2010. The cost of the turnarounds, as well as the
annual maintenance costs, significantly exceeded the originally allocated budget and also

significantly increased after 2008.?!

°! On 5 August 2010, the FertiNitro Board discussed the Plants’ escalating functioning costs and pointed that since
2008, the costs had increased more than “twofold” in terms of US$. The turnarounds were all over budget. The
2005 turnaround cost US$ 21.4 million, approximately US$ 10 million over budget. The second turnaround
scheduled for 2008, cost US$ 40.4 million. Further maintenance work was required in 2009 and 2010, and a third,
unscheduled turnaround took place in 2010, at a cost US$ 40 million. FertiNitro Board of Directors’ Meeting

2005 to 2007.°? The amount of urea that Pequiven was to be allowed to purchase under its
proposals was capped at 75,000 tons.** According to the testimony of Mr Gwaltney, the

proposed reduced price was below FertiNitro’s production costs.”

5.27 During the FertiNitro board meetings, the Pequiven-appointed directors explained that the
additional urea was to be used for resale in the domestic market and thereby support the
Government’s agricultural plans.°° The Pequiven-appointed directors added that
Pequiven’s proposals would only take effect “in the event that Pequiven [could not] cover

demands with its own production” from plants at el Moron and el Tablazo.°°

eventually rejected Pequiven’s request.°”

limits of the Offtake Agreement should be amended.” These recommendations were not

adopted by FertiNitro’s board of directors.

In 2005 a draft amended Petrochemical law was submitted to the Respondent’s National
Assembly. Its effects on FertiNitro were discussed in several meetings of FertiNitro’s

board of directors, held between 2005 and 2007.!

During those meetings, Mr Toro, a Pequiven-appointed director, informed the other
shareholder-appointed directors that, pursuant to the text of the proposed amended law: (i)
FertiNitro would be required to supply the domestic demand for urea before exporting urea;
and (ii) the Respondent needed to have at least a 51% controlling share of FertiNitro,!°! so
as take control of the business, and that “time [was] run[ning] out.”!°? Mr Toro further
stated that “Pequiven will be bringing specific proposals for the consideration of all the

shareholders” and that “all shareholders rights and agreements will be respected.” !°

2007: Further to those discussions, from 2007 onwards, Pequiven entered into buy-out
negotiations with all the private shareholders in FertiNitro. On 7 November 2007, KOMSA
representatives presented a draft Memorandum of Understanding for the sale to Pequiven

of the non-Pequiven shareholders’ shares in FertiNitro (the “KOMSA Draft MOU”).!%*
According to paragraph 2.1 of the KOMSA Draft MOU:

“The Parties hereby agree that the aggregate purchase price to be paid by Pequiven
for the Shares will consist of (a) USD$ 1,210,000,000.00, less the outstanding
balance of principal and accrued interest on FertiNitro’s existing bank and bond
financing as of the Closing Date, plus (b) the Excess Cash (the ‘Purchase Price’).
‘Excess Cash’ would be defined as FertiNitro’s cash balance on the Closing Date,

5.34 2008: Discussions relating to the buy-out negotiations were halted between January and

April 2008.'°° In October 2008, Pequiven presented a revised draft Memorandum of

Understanding (the “Pequiven Draft MOU”).'°’ According to paragraph 1 of the Pequiven

Draft MOU:

“(a) The purchase price (“Purchase Price”) to be paid by Pequiven to Koch
Shareholder for the Acquired Shares is US$297,500,000.00, which shall be payable
in cash at the closing of the Proposed Transaction (the “Closing” ).

(b) For reference purposes only and with the agreement by Pequiven and Koch
Shareholder that the Purchase Price is a fixed amount and not subject to adjustment
the Purchase Price was determined by taking a starting value for 100% of the
Companies of US$1,200,000,000.00, and (i) subtracting the outstanding balance of
principal and all accrued interest on the Companies’ existing bank and bond
financing as of October 6, 2008, (ii) adding excess cash, exclusive of reserves, as of
such date, and (iii) multiplying the resulting agreed net value of US$850,000,000.00
by the 35% total equity interests in the Companies owned directly or indirectly by

Koch Shareholder and LAIF.”!°5 (Emphasis in original)

5.35 Neither the KOMSA nor the Pequiven draft MOUs were executed. The Parties’ disagree

as to the cause for such non-execution. According to the Claimants, the drafts were not

finalised because Pequiven indicated that the sale was no longer a priority for the

Respondent.'” According to the Respondent, the “[n]egotiations were interrupted in

November 2008 due to financing issues.”!!?

(iv) The Respondent’s Measures and the Relevant Legal Framework

1998: On 6 December 1998, President Chavez was elected as the Respondent’s Head of
State. He took office in February 1999. During the period leading to his election, Venezuela
was importing 64% of its food and was a “net importer” of agricultural products.!'!? Article
305 of the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution enacted under the Government of President
Chavez enshrined the policy objectives of pursuing food security and food sovereignty.!'*
Thereafter, the Respondent engaged in a process to increase its capacity for agricultural

production.

2001: In September 2001, the Respondent issued a 2001-2007 “Plan for Economic and
Social Development of the Nation.”!'> According to paragraph 1.1.3.1-4 of the Plan, the
Government was to prioritise improvement in agricultural productivity to meet domestic
demands for food. In 2002, the Respondent developed a three-year national programme to
develop food security and rural development, with the assistance of the United Nations

Food and Agriculture Organization. !!°

2002: On 1 July 2002, the Expropriation Law for Public or Social Benefit entered into
effect.!'’ In accordance with Article 2 of the Expropriation Law, expropriation is an
“institution of Public Law by which the State acts in furtherance of a purpose having public

utility or societal interest.” Article 7 sets out the mandatory requirements for any

declaration that carrying out such [interest] necessarily requires the total or partial transfer
of the property or right; (iii) a fair price for the property subject to expropriation; and (iv)

timely payment in cash or fair compensation.” Article 5 of the Law provides:

“The Expropriation Decree consists of a declaration that the execution of a project
requires the compulsory acquisition of the totality of a property or various properties,
or a portion thereof. [...] The Expropriation Decree shall require a prior finding of
public utility, in accordance with the provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of this Law.”

5.41 On 2 December 2002, political and civic organisations began a national civic work-
stoppage in Venezuela. It “seriously affected many of the country’s economic activities,

especially the oil industry.”!'® Employees of PDVSA took part in the stoppage.'!? It

0

affected Pequiven, whose operations were shut down.'?° The stoppage also brought

important changes to the staffing of Pequiven, and consequently to the personnel of
FertiNitro.!?!_ According to the Claimants, subsequent to the stoppage, the Respondent

replaced management in PDVSA, Pequiven and FertiNitro with individuals who were

deemed loyal to the Government, regardless of their technical qualifications. '?

5.42 2004: In 2004, Pequiven had to import urea to meet local demand.!?3 At that time,
Pequiven and FertiNitro were the only companies in Venezuela producing urea. Pequiven’s
production facilities, “El Tablazo” and “Moron”, experienced significant problems.

According to the Respondent, Pequiven’s plants could not meet local demand.

2005: In 2005, the Respondent adopted a four-year “National Seed Plan” (Plan Nacional
de Semillas).'*+ At that time, the Respondent was importing over 70% of its food, 100%
of its vegetable seeds and over 60%-70% of its corn seed.'?> The national plan sought to
reduce import dependency and to increase domestic food production, through (inter alia)

seed production and development.!?¢

2006: On 28 July 2006, the “Partial Reform Law of the Law on Incentives for Development
of the Petrochemical and Carbochemical Activities and other related activities” entered
into force.'2’ In accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of this law, Pequiven “shall comply and
execute the policies dictated by the National Executive [...]” and “shall be the exclusive

property of [...] Venezuela.”
In December 2006, President Chavez was re-elected to a third presidential term.

2007: On 6 March 2007, Decree 5,218 dated 26 February 2007 (the “Urea Decree”) came
into effect.'28 Pursuant to Articles 1 and 2, nitrogenous fertilizers and the supplies
necessary for their manufacture were “declared to be basic necessities throughout the
national territory,” and manufacturers, suppliers, and exporters of nitrogenous fertilizers
were “required to supply [urea] on a priority basis to the national market.” In accordance
with Articles 3 and 5 of the Urea Decree, the price and production of fertilizers were to be
regulated by joint resolutions of the Ministry of Popular Power for Agriculture and Land,

the Ministry for Light Industries and Commerce and the Ministry for Energy and Oil.

129 Joint Resolution by the Ministry of the People’s

Under the Urea Decree, a joint resolution was adopted, coming into effect on 2 May 2007
(the “Urea Resolution”). '?° Pequiven was consulted by the Respondent during the drafting

process of the Urea Decree and the Urea Resolution. '*”

The Urea Resolution established the maximum price at which urea manufacturers could
sell urea to Pequiven. It authorised Pequiven to purchase from any manufacturer in
Venezuela the necessary quantities of urea to satisfy national demand.'*! In addition, urea
manufacturers in Venezuela had to inform the relevant ministry of the Respondent as to
the amount of urea produced by them, together with the percentages of urea product

destined for domestic and international consumption. '**

At this time, as was well known to the Claimants and the Respondent, only Pequiven and
FertiNitro produced urea in Venezuela.'** Therefore, apart from Pequiven’s production
facilities, “El Tablazo” and ““Morén’”, which had encountered difficulties since 2004, the
Urea Decree and Urea Resolution, in practice applied only to the FertiNitro Plant (Pequiven

being 100% owned by the Respondent).

Pursuant to the Urea Decree and Urea Resolution, FertiNitro was required to sell urea to
Pequiven at below production costs and below the price specified in the Offtake
Agreement. !*4 After the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar in 2010, the difference in

value between the production price and the regulated price increased.

During that same period, Pequiven’s other plant, El Tablazo, was exporting urea to other
markets, including Ecuador, which could affect the levels of urea required from FertiNitro

to meet the local urea demand.'** Mr Toro, the then Pequiven-appointed director,

The National Executive shall, without other prior formality, initiate expropriation

through decree for reasons of food security and sovereignty.” '77

On 31 July 2008, the Law on Food Security and Sovereignty entered into effect.'** Article
3 of the law provided that “[t]he goods that ensure the availability and timely access to
foods of sufficient quality [...] are declared to be of public interest and social welfare” and
that “[w]hen there exist reasons related to food security, the Executive of the Nation may
decree the mandatory acquisition in its entirety-with fair compensation and timely
payment-of one of several goods needed to carry out projects or activities related to the
production [...] of foods.” In addition, Article 20 granted the Executive the power to,
amongst other matters, “pass economic and financial measures that may be necessary for

the implementation of national production plans.”

2009: On 18 June 2009, the Organic Law for the Development of Petrochemical Activities
dated 16 June 2009 came into effect (the “2009 Petrochemical Law”).'*? Article 5 of this

Law provides:

“The basic and intermediate petrochemical activity is reserved for the State, as well
as the works, assets and facilities required for its operation. This reserve will be
exercised directly by the National Executive or through companies of its exclusive
ownership. It can also be exercised by the State through Mixed Companies in which

On 15 July 2009, Mr C. Inciarte, President of FertiNitro and of Pequiven, informed the
FertiNitro board of directors that, according to the official policy of the Respondent’s Vice-
Ministry of Petrochemistry (with which Pequiven agreed), the 2009 Petrochemical Law,
and in particular its Article 5, would not apply to FertiNitro, because it was not to be applied

retroactively by the Respondent. '4°

2010: On 10 October 2010, President Chavez appeared to sign Decree 7,713, in front of
television cameras during his weekly television show called “Alo Presidente.” (“Decree
7,713”; or the “Expropriation Decree”). As President Chavez signed the Expropriation

Decree, he was recorded as stating (as translated into English):

“Look, so as to accomplish the capable and effective carrying out of the national
plans of seeding and production, formulated by the National Executive, and that are
necessary for the execution of the work of the socialist agro-alimentary sovereignty
pla Approved, that it be expropriated and it pass to the property, to the
nation’s property.” '*!

 

This Expropriation Decree dated 10 October 2010, which was published in the
Respondent’s Official Gazette on 11 October 2010 over President Chavez’s signature,

provided (inter alia): '47

Article 8. The Minister of the People’s Power for Energy and Oil is appointed for the
execution of the present Decree”?
There is disagreement between the Parties on whether any notice was provided to the
Claimants (or to KOMSA) of the Expropriation Decree. The Claimants contend that no
advance notice of the Expropriation Decree was given by the Respondent.'+ The
Respondent contends, in turn, “Venezuela provided both constructive and actual notice that
FertiNitro could be subject to a mandatory acquisition” through a series of actions starting

as early as 2005. !45

On 11 October 2010, the day following the televised signing of the Expropriation Decree
by President Chavez, the Respondent’s Minister of Energy and Oil (Mr Rafael Ramirez)
travelled in person to the FertiNitro Plant. He there made the following statement during
an interview by journalists broadcast on public television, directed also to employees of
FertiNitro, Pequiven and PDVSA assembled at the Plant. This public address merits citing
almost in full (as translated into English), with paragraph numbers here added for ease of

later reference: '°

“[1]... [Minister Rafael Ramirez unrecorded] ...mandate of our laws, of our
government, of our revolution, because this is a fundamental plant for agricultural
development of our country, our food sovereignty, this is a plant with which we have
been meeting with for a long time, without any success whatsoever, to try to have
them adapt to our needs in the national development plan. So that we may see the
importance that this company [i.e. FertiNitro]'*" has in the national agricultural
system ... well, first is to announce that at a national level we produce 380,000 tons
per year of fertilizers, and urea in particular. But this sole plant produces 1,500,000
tons per year of urea. This is a very large plant, the largest we have in the country.

Article 11 of the Expropriation Law (cited in the Expropriation Decree) relates to “Releases of encumbrances on

expropriated property” and Art. 12 to the Right of Subrogation. See Expropriation Law (1 July 2002) (R-53).

'47 The Tribunal’s interpretation is here added in square brackets, as also the insertions in square brackets below.

85

[2] Ok now, this is a plant that, receiving gas produced by the Venezuelan State at
as subsidized price, that is to say, between 0.5 and 1.5 dollars per MMBTU, one must
consider that outside the country gas is now selling for between 3 and 12 dollars per
MMBTU. Notwithstanding this subsidized price, it is impossible that this plant, in
which Pequiven had a minority interest, would not adjust to the fertilizer supply
requirements for national development.

[3] We currently have a consumption of 600,000 tons of urea, but we are in now in
our development plans, the total seeding plan designed by the national government,
to cover up to 5 million hectares. We are setting a requirement of more than 1.3
million tons. With the control of this plant that the Venezuelan state will be taking
[i.e. the FertiNitro Plant], we now have guaranteed all of the urea that our farm
workers may need, all of the urea that our producing sector may need, to sustain this
extraordinary seeding plan and to sustain national development.

[4] On another topic, this plant, which had a group of private shareholders, we had
serious problems with sales. Being a fertilizer produced with Venezuelan gas, well,
we had a limit where we could only acquire up to 10% of its production for the
domestic market. And, when they sold it to us, they sold it at a price that was 2.5 to
3 times in excess of the price at which Pequiven sells its fertilizers. [These appear to
be references to the Offtake Agreement].

[5] Such that, we are here very satisfied, because we know that this step is a step
closer toward our sovereignty. We are with the workers, who are the fundamental
actors of this process and, of course, paying attention to the guidelines of
Commandant Chavez, of President Chavez, in the deepening of our Bolivarian
revolution.”

[J]

[6] Well, here we have a plant of about 400 workers. Of course, the private parties
were using an outsourcing model. We are going to eliminate the outsourcing and
enter upon a process of worker action — regularize all of the relationships with our
workers — because socialism is about an economic system where the base, the
relationship, the production relationships have to be within the framework of the
ethics of socialism. It can’t be; we can’t have workers here that are being exploited
by trans-national companies while they are the ones making the profits outside the
country. [These appear to be references (inter alia) to FertiNitro’s foreign
shareholders, including KOMSA].

[7] So then, now a process is beginning, of course, a legal proceeding; all of the
mechanisms are being initiated to complete the legal steps for expropriation. But we

86

are here with our workers, workers from Pequiven, workers from FertiNitro, and
workers from PDVSA, already in control of the plant and making inspections of the
installations because, of course, we have to guarantee that all of the assets are
preserved, which from here on out belong to the Republic.

[8] Newsperson: The benefits of the countries of ALBA, which FertiNitro will have
also? Minister Rafael Ramirez: Well, look. First of all, with this we guarantee our
supply to the internal market. And later, we will have the control of sales. Up to this
moment, the trans-national that operated here was the one that managed the volumes
quoted, in accordance with its own criteria, according to its commercial policy. We,
as you all know, in the heart of ALBA in Latin America and in our own domestic
market, we have a different view. We have available people and natural resources,
such as natural gas, which is the one used in this case, to convert it into inputs for
the manufacturing process. In this sense, this plant will allow us to ensure that our
policy is carried out in the future. [These appear to be references (inter alia) to the
Offtake Agreement].

[9] Newsperson: (Unintelligible). Minister Rafael Ramirez: Well, yes, we are first
taking here. We are guaranteeing ... take note that a plant stoppage has been started
right now, at the beginning of their work. For that reason, there is a lot of movement...
because we are always tending to the maintenance of our installations in optimum
condition.

[10] Newsperson: What will be the impact of the nationalization of FertiNitro on the
people? Minister Rafael Ramirez: Well, very positive, because it will now allow us to
have available the volumes of fertilizers that we may need of urea at national prices.
Note that Pequiven sells the 50 kilo sack of urea at 19 Bolivars, and here FertiNitro
used to sell it to us at 50 Bolivars. That is to say, a difference of more than 2.5 times.
Now we will have available the price that is regulated by the state, of 19.5, and we
will be able to have available all of the urea that the domestic market may require.
In that sense, between this operation and the nationalization of Agrolslena, now
AgroPatria, we are going to have the entire chain to be able to supply our farm
working sector, over there in the Andes so that they may produce coffee, there in the
plains so they may produce corn, so that they may produce sorghum. That is to say,
all that we have seen is a fundamental element for us to be able to transcend the oil-
producing model, and it is a fundamental model for guaranteeing the security and
the feeding of our people. In the measure that we have the inputs for the entire chain
controlled by the state, such that it guarantees that no speculation will take place
with them, that is to say, with the fertilizers, the chemicals, the agro-chemicals, our
people we be able to continue to have food available, there will be more work the

87

fields and, our people, across the socialist distribution network, we will then be able
to have secure food at low prices, in abundance for all of our country. [Again, these
appear to be references (inter alia) to the Offtake Agreement].

[11] Newsperson: What steps for our national sovereignty? Minister Rafael Ramirez:
That's right, I also want to underscore and thank the unwavering support of workers,
the support of our FUTEC, which is the confederation of our workers, Socialist
Workers Vanguard, all of the peoples’ organizations, the worker organizations that
from, just yesterday, when the president made the announcements, are here
safeguarding these installations, here at FertiNitro, as well as concurrently, our
workers are in the State of Carabobo, ing, safe ding the installations
of Industria Venoco, which has also been nationalized by the revolution. Both steps
are very important, because it is a sector in which we have to guarantee sovereignty.
In the case of Venoco, we are dealing with a sector fundamental for production of
chemicals, lubricants, greases, needed by the electrical and the industrial sectors,
where the same situation was being repeated. It being PDVSA, being the State, which
supplies the raw materials; well, there is a sale policy that, in a clear way, was
impeding the plans to make available the natural resources for service to the people.

 

[12] Newsperson: How many people? Minister Rafael Ramirez: In FertiNitro, 400

persons. In Venoco we have about 360 persons. Yes, FertiNitro, FertiNitro. In ...

national they have about [4]50 persons, that’s more or less the number, which is the

largest concentration of persons.

[J]

[13] These are very important actions, because these companies, as you well know,

were companies and businesses that were remnants of the prior republic. They were
if and businesses of trans ional and national capital that were taking

advantage of the supply of raw materials, cheaply, of the Venezuelan state, and of

PDVSA in this plant, in particular.

 

[14] And I want to salute all of the workers and their political organizations. I want
to salute the workers of FUTEC. I want to salute the workers of the Socialist Workers’
Vanguard. I want to salute all of our workers who, as of just yesterday, came here to
secure and guarantee the operations of, and the integrity of these assets that, today,
belong to the Venezuelan state. We know that we can always count on the petroleum
workers, we can always count on the petrochemical workers, we can count on the
working class, we can count on the workers, the engineers, the technicians that make
it all possible, that from day to day, we get our energy inputs. You all know that we
have waged the battle for full petroleum sovereignty; that battle, that the Bolivarian

88

government has advanced and consolidated. And today, with Chavez, we can say that
we are sovereign in the management of our petroleum resources.

[15] Now we are on the offensive to deepen food sovereignty. Only a few days ago,
Commandant Chavez announced the nationalization of the AgroIslefia company,
today the AgroPatria company. It is a company that allows us to provide for our farm
workers, for our people, the agricultural inputs produced in the country and that the
private parties held as a speculative tool, bringing poverty to the fields. This is now
under the control of the State.

[16] Yesterday, the nationalization of FertiNitro was announced. So that we can see
the importance of this plant we, with our petrochemical industry - Pequiven - produce
at a national level two hundred, three hundred eighty thousand tons/year of urea that,
as you all know, is fundamental for food production. This sole plant- FertiNitro -
produces, on its own, 1,500,000 tons/year of urea. That is to say, five times more than
what is produced in all of the plants nation-wide.

[17] But what was the problem? That this plant being, this plant [i.e. the FertiNitro
Plant] receives gas produced by Petréleos de Venezuela, gas belonging to all
Venezuelans. We sell it to them at a subsidized price, between 0.5 and 1.5 dollars per
ton, per MMBTU. One has to consider, that in the world gas sells for 3 and has even
gotten as high as 12 dollars per MMBTU. Here there is a subsidized price, 12 times
less than it is sold for outside the country. But then these gentlemen, these private
capitalists, foreign and national, produce urea fertilizer with that gas in large
quantities and the majority of it is exported. That is to say, it doesn't come to supply
national needs. [These appear to be references (inter alia) to FertiNitro’s foreign
shareholders, including KOMSA, and to KNI and the Offtake Agreement].

[18] It has cost us a lot to get these gentlemen to sell some fertilizer to the country.
And after many discussions, we were able to secure that they would sell us only 10%
of their production. And do you know at what price they would sell it to us? At triple
the price at which Pequiven sells fertilizer in the national market. Such that, all of
the fertilizer that was produced was at the disposal of the marketing companies, in
this case a North American company, Koch, which would grab all of our fertilizer
and sell it outside the country at speculative prices. [These appears to be references
(inter alia) to KNI and the Offtake Agreement].

[19] With this nationalization action, we are guaranteeing, in the first instance, that

all of the fertilizer that our farm workers may need, all of the fertilizer that our
national seeding plan may need, all of the fertilizer that we may need to produce food

89

for our people, will be abundant, cheap and secure for all of our people. That is, that
would be, the only reason.

[20] This is what Commandant Chavez has indicated - These large industrial
installations located in national territory, which exploit the workers, which speculate
with our own resources, should pass into the hands of the Venezuelan state. They
should pass into the hands of the people. With the acquisition, with the
nationalization of this plant, what we are doing is strengthening our nation’s
property, the property of all the men and women that live in the national territory.
But in addition, and most importantly, the control of a plant like this one, FertiNitro,
will enable us to guarantee the National Seeding Plan and the food sovereignty of
the country. It will guarantee that the gas produced by our workers over there in
PDVSA Gas, that they produce in Anaco with so much effort and what it has cost us
to have controlled our oil & gas industry, may then be converted into fertilizer to
benefit our people, so that our men, women and children may have a secure food
supply.

[21] Also, in the same way that we are gathered here today in the State of Anzodtegui,
in the Jose Antonio Anzodtegui complex, our fellow workers are in the State of
Carabobo securing the nationalized installations of the Venoco company...

[22] Finally, I want to say in the name of our President, to guarantee to our workers,
that all of the despicable capitalist practices, like the outsourcing and exploitation of
workers, will end at this company. There can be no outsourcing whatsoever. There
can be no exploitation whatsoever of our workers.

[23] We are going to build socialism... we are going to build socialism and in this
sense, the Venezuelan state and the working class have an extraordinary role to play.
Fellow workers, the future is yours. For you we are building socialism, for the men
and women working every day in our national industries, in order to be able to
guarantee to our people, to our communities, the communities that live near all of
our industrial complexes, the communities of Vifiedo, the communities of Barcelona,
the communities of Puerto Espirito, that all of the Venezuelan people will receive the
benefits that the Venezuelan state and its workers control, then, as important a
company as this one that we are controlling - FertiNitro. Companions, workers, the
call is to deepen the combat, to continue deepening our revolution, and, under the
guidance and orientation of Commandant Chavez, we are sure that we are going to
prevail. Country, Socialism or Death! We shall conquer! Thank you, companions.”

5.61

The Tribunal finds the following facts established by the events of 10 and 11 October 2010,
as recorded above. First, the Minister’s visit to and address at the FertiNitro Plant took
place in the context of the Expropriation Decree, particularly Article 1 on the “mandatory
acquisition of movable and real estate assets”!*® of FertiNitro and Article 6 on the
“occupancy” of FertiNitro’s assets. Under Article 8 of the Decree, the Minister was
responsible for its execution; and the Minister referred expressly to President Chavez’s
“announcements” of 10 October 2010: see paragraphs [11] and [16] above. Second,
pursuant to the Expropriation Decree, the Minister was carrying out or confirming the
Respondent’s “control” of the FertiNitro Plant: see paragraphs [3], [7], [20] and [23] above.
Third, that control, in the Minister’s words, derived from FertiNitro’s “nationalisation” and
“expropriation” by the Respondent under the Expropriation Decree: see paragraphs [7],
[10], [16] and [20] above. Fourth, that control necessarily extended beyond the physical
and other assets of the FertiNitro Plant to include the abrogation of any existing contractual
restrictions on FertiNitro’s product being sold otherwise than for the domestic Venezuelan
market, or as the Respondent might otherwise decide: see paragraphs [3], [4], [8], [10],
[17], [18] and [19]. The Expropriation Decree itself said nothing expressly in regard to the
abrogation of FertiNitro’s existing contracts; but its effect, read with the Minister’s address,
leave no room for doubting the Respondent’s intentions towards the Offtake Agreement.
Fifth, as one motive for the Expropriation Decree, the Minister referred in derogatory terms
to “trans-national” companies and “foreign” capitalists: see paragraphs [6], [8], [13 and
[17] above. Last, but not least, the Minister was careful to describe the Respondent’s
actions within the framework of Venezuelan law: see his reference to “legal proceeding”

and “legal steps for expropriation” in paragraph [7] above.

According to the Respondent, there was no physical occupation of the Plant at that point
by Pequiven’s employees or others. Instead, Mr Ramirez, as the responsible Minister

“Ttook] control of the plant and was inspecting the installations in order to guarantee that

448 See Expropriation Decree (C-9), Art. 1: “Se ordena la adquisicién forzosa de los bienes muebles e inmuebles,

incluyendo bienhechurias, instalaciones, plantas, equipos industriales, de oficina y demds activo:

requerid

   

o

necesarios para la actividad de producci6n, procesamiento, transporte y almacenamiento de fertilizantes [...]”

91

5.62

5.63

all of FertiNitro’s assets had been secured.”'4? The Tribunal does not consider this
description to be factually complete. By this time, the FertiNitro Plant was occupied by
persons answerable to the Respondent (as distinct from FertiNitro) and whose conduct in
seizing and physically controlling the FertiNitro Plant was approved and ratified by the
Minister for the Respondent, as evidenced by the terms of his public address on 11 October

2010 and the Expropriation Decree cited above.

2011: On 26 July 2011, Pequiven (represented by Mr Barrientos) applied for orders to
“request the expropriation of the asset” [of FertiNitro] (in the Spanish text of the
application: “solicitar la expropiacién de los bienes’”) to the Second Circuit of First

Instance of Civil, Commercial, Agrarian and Transit Law of the Judicial Circuit of the

0

Anzoategui State.!°° As explained by the Respondent’s counsel at the Third (June)

Hearing, Pequiven thereby sought orders regarding (inter alia) the appointment of an ad
hoc (temporary) board of trustees to run FertiNitro with legal power of control of all aspects

of its business. !5!

As regards its authority to request such orders from the Anzoategui Court, Pequiven’s

application read as follows: !>?

“By virtue of the Expropriation Decree [...] PEQUIVEN is authorized to make the
necessary ar for the acquisition of the le and ii le property
of FERTINITRO, being granted all rights and obligations pertaining to the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela for such purposes. PEQUIVEN is also authorized
to initiate and execute the expropriation proceedings under the Expropriation Law
for Public Benefit or Social Interest, published in the Official Gazette of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No. 37,475 on July 1, 2002 (hereinafter
“Expropriation Law”) until full and final transfer of ownership of the property listed
therein to the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, through PEQUIVEN or a designated
subsidiary thereof.”

(v) Other Events Following the Expropriation Decree

5.65 2010: According to the Respondent, at the time of the Expropriation Decree (dated
10 October 2010), KOMSA’s personnel at FertiNitro were no longer fulfilling their

tasks.'*° The control exercised by FertiNitro’s board of directors had ceased, as Pequiven

“was given control of the operations, management and capitalization of FertiNitro.”!°°

subsequent to the Expropriation Decree. '*” On 9 November 2010, the FertiNitro directors
appointed by KOMSA formally resigned from their positions.'** The FertiNitro-appointed

directors by Polar formally resigned a few days later, on 22 November 2010.!°°

stating:

made and entered on April 8, 1998 [...]

Based on the current start up of the plants, FertiNitro has sent the December and
January allocation of products to each Offtakers and it is expected to comply fifty
percent (50%) of the actual total plants output, such as it is stipulated in the
agreement. Please note that total volume for Koch in December is as follow:
Ammonia: 23.000MT +/- 10%

Urea: 34.345 MT +/- 10%

Please let us know your December program in order to FertiNitro can make all the

necessary arrangement with authorities as customs, export permissions, etc.”!°!

5.69 On3 December 2010, Mr Gwaltney (for KNI) sent an email message to Mr Perdomo (of

FertiNitro) replying as follows:

“T am in receipt of your letter of December I, 2010 to Jacob Strand of KNI
acknowledging the nationalization of FertiNitro and KNI has authorized me to
respond on their behalf. As you are aware, the government's recent action constitutes
an expropriation of KNI’s, and its affiliates, interests in FertiNitro including, but not
limited to, the Offtake Agreement.

Mr. Francisco Garcia recently informed me that he has been appointed by Pequiven
to lead a commercial team to negotiate and compensate KNI and FertiNitro’s
shareholders for the expropriation. I also understand that Pequiven has confirmed
they have taken the offtake in its entirety, as part of the expropriation, and that they
will compensate KNI for that. I further understand that Pequiven has requested that
KNI purchase product under terms and conditions similar with the Offtake
Agreement for a limited period of time while Pequiven negotiates with the lenders so
as to ensure steady cash flow, in large part, for the benefit of the lenders. While we
are still analyzing the full impact and ramifications of the government’s actions, we

understand both Pequiven and FertiNitro’s desire to continue a commercial
relationship with KNI despite having expropriated its and its affiliates’ property.

Given this, and on the understanding that Pequiven intends to compensate KNI, and
its affiliates, in a manner to which they are entitled for the expropriation of their
property under international law, for limited period of time until further notice, KNI
agrees to purchase product under terms consistent with the Offtake Agreement.
Payment for product shall be to the same historical bank accounts. It is also KNI’s
expectation that FertiNitro will conduct its business affairs consistent with any and
all lending obligations and in full compliance with all relevant laws.

This communication and KNI’s action in agreeing to purchase product from
FertiNitro is on strictly without prejudice basis. KNI and its affiliates, hereby
expressly reserve any and all rights that may exist including under the Offtake

Agreement, resulting from, or in any way associated with, governmental actions

including, but not limited to, rights under any domestic or international laws.” '

2011: From December 2010 onwards, Pequiven entered into agreements with the
FertiNitro project’s bankers and bondholders to settle the debts of FertiNitro. This exercise

was apparently completed by January 2012.!°

During 2011, representatives of Pequiven and of the other FertiNitro shareholders met on
various occasions to discuss the amount of compensation due to these other shareholders
(including KOMSA) from the Respondent. Such meetings were held on 16 February 2011
in New York;!® 6 April and 23 May 2011 in Caracas and 1 September 2011 in Miami.!°
A crucial issue between Pequiven and these shareholders was the study of and methodology

for FertiNitro’s valuation.

The negotiations between Pequiven and the FertiNitro shareholders eventually resulted in
amicable settlement agreements with LAIF (as a 10% shareholder). Snamprogetti (as a

20% shareholder and EPC Contractor) also reached an inchoate agreement with

negotiations.

5.73 On 28 June 2011, i.e. before the final meeting in September 2011, the Claimants filed their
Request for Arbitration before ICSID.

5.74 As already noted above, on 26 July 2011, Pequiven filed a Petition to the Court of First
Instance of the Judicial Circuit of Anzodtegui in order to carry out the mandatory
acquisition and requesting that a temporary Ad Hoc Board of Temporary Judicial
Administrators be established to govern FertiNitro, further to the Venezuelan law on

Circuit of Anzoategui issued a decision accepting jurisdiction to hear the Request for
Mandatory Acquisition.'” Thereafter, these legal proceedings continued and, apparently,
still continue, without payment of any compensation to the Claimants under the

Expropriation Decree.

5.75 In the summer of 2011, during their negotiations, Pequiven presented to FertiNitro’s
shareholders (including KOMSA) valuation reports prepared by financial consultants
called Advantis (also mistakenly called in the evidence “Adventis”). Advantis had been
created by former officers of Booz Allen in Venezuela.'”° There were two written reports

of May and July 2011, both dated “September 2010.”!7! That was not the date of the

documents’ production, but rather (presumably) the end-date of the calculations made by
Advantis. Advantis were independent consultants retained by Pequiven to value FertiNitro
in their negotiations with (inter alios) KOMSA. Advantis was not advising or howsoever
acting for the Claimants. Their reports were not “joint reports;” nor were their valuations
ever accepted as correct by KOMSA or (so it appears) by the Respondent itself. Neither
valuation was professed by Pequiven as a firm offer by the Respondent capable of
acceptance by KOMSA, without further negotiations. Moreover, Pequiven had indicated
to the shareholders that it did not have the authority nor the funds - to conclude by itself -

any agreement for the Respondent.!7”

The circumstances whereby these two reports were transmitted to KOMSA in 2011 remain
unclear on the evidence adduced in this arbitration. As to the first Advantis report of May
2011 entitled “Valoracion de FertiNitro”, it appears from contemporary email messages
dated 18 and 19 May 2011 that it was sent by Advantis to Pequiven and by Pequiven to
KOMSA as a shareholder in FertiNitro, ' presumably for the meeting that took place
between their representatives on 23 May 2011 in Caracas.'7* Mr Gwaltney (for KOMSA)
sent a letter of 19 May 2011 to Pequiven criticising this first Advantis valuation.'”> As to
the second Advantis report of July 2011 also entitled “Valoracion de FertiNitro”, the
Claimants accept that, as with the first report, it was transmitted by Pequiven to KOMSA

as a shareholder in FertiNitro.'”°

Mr Barrientos (of Pequiven) explained the background to these Advantis reports in his oral

testimony at the First (September) Hearing: !””

“At the first meeting that we had in February 2011, one of the requests that Pequiven
tabled was that, working together with the expropriated shareholders, that we would

hire a third party to come in and give us an evaluation of the company, and then on
that basis, establish compensation. But none of the expropriated shareholders
accepted that proposal and that is why Pequiven on its own hired a third party to do
the evaluation [...] Adventis is a company that has provided services to a variety of
mixed companies in valuation for Pequiven, in other areas as well, it is a well
recognised firm, and of course this is something that we have taken very seriously. It
was something that was enshrined in a Government decree. We [Pequiven] were
designated as the expropriating entity and we were taking this very seriously. We
hired Adventis, we were trying to reach a consensus with the expropriated
shareholders in order to get them involved in selecting a single valuation expert and
since they didn’t agree with this we felt free to go out and work with the company
that we felt was the most qualified to do this job, and that was Adventis. It has
considerable credentials which give it trustworthiness for this type of valuation and
that’s why we decided to work with them. [...] as part of the negotiation team I met
with them, along with the rest of the group [...] I can tell you that Adventis is a well
recognised company and I don’t think they would have jeopardised their reputation
by getting involved in that type of valuation.”

The witness had been asked whether Advantis had been instructed by Pequiven “to
make the valuation as low as possible. ”!78
5.78 The Tribunal returns to the content of these two Advantis Reports later in Part IX of this
Award. For present purposes, it suffices to record that the first report valued FertiNitro at
US$ 398 million as at 30 September 2010!” (thereby valuing KOMSA’s 25% interest at
US$ 99.5 million); and the second report valued FertiNitro at US$ 452 million as at 30
September 2010 under a first scenario; '* that report also contained an alternative scenario
which contained elements which increased and others which decreased the value of
Fertinitro with a total value of US$ 561 million (thereby valuing KOMSA’s 25% interest
at US$ 113 million under the first scenario and US$ 140.25 million under the second).!*!

Both reports used a DCF methodology.

5.79 2012: By January 2012, as already indicated, FertiNitro had satisfied the debts owed to its
bondholders and banks. As confirmed by the Respondent’s counsel at the Third (June)

Hearing:

“In December 2011, FertiNitro satisfied its obligations with respect to the bond-
holders and the banks. At that point, once those obligations were satisfied, there was
no longer a commercial requirement to have the offtake agreement in place. As part
of its obligation to operate for the commercial purpose of FertiNitro, the ad hoc
board of trustees took the decision that by getting rid of the offtake agreement, it
would have the opportunity to pursue more lucrative sales agreements with other
customers; or, to the extent necessary, to use production to satisfy domestic
demand.” !®?

5.80 On 28 February 2012, the President of the ad hoc board of trustees of FertiNitro sent a
letter to KOMSA and KNI, for the attention of Mr Gwaltney and Mr Parra, stating (inter

alia):

“T hereby notify you that, in accordance with the Resolution issued by the Board of
Temporary Ad-Hoc Trustees of Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, FertiNitro,
C.E.C., (“FertiNitro”), as is evidenced by appointment effected by Decrees handed
down by [the Anzodtegui Court] [...]; effective from the date of this communication,
FertiNitro shall not sell any more nitrogen fertilizers (urea and ammonia) to Koch
Oil, S.A. under the marketing agreement entered into between Petroquimica de
Venezuela S.A., International Petrochemical Sales Limited, Koch Oil S.A., and
Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, C.E.C. on April 8, 1998; all of which is in
fulfilment of what is established in Decree 7,713 published in Official Gazette of the
Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela No. 39,528 of October 11, 2010, which orders the
compulsory acquisition of movable and immovable property [...]’'?

5.81 The Parties disagree as to the nature of the sales transactions of ammonia and urea from
FertiNitro to KNI made from the date of the Expropriation Decree (dated 10 October 2010)

to the issuance of FertiNitro’s letter above (28 February 2012).

5.82

5.83

5.84

5.85

According to the Respondent, all of FertiNitro’s ammonia and urea was sold pursuant to
the Offtake Agreement; and that, until February 2012, FertiNitro continued “[complying]
with the percentages permitted under the Offtake Agreement to supply the domestic
market.” '* It was only after February 2012 that the percentage allocated to the domestic
market increased substantially to fulfil the Respondent’s needs.'** Similarly, “KNI and
Pequiven received their share of urea and ammonia, at the same discounted price.” !*° In
addition, Mr Barrientos (as the Project Manager and General Manager of Pequiven)
testified that, after Decree 7,713 was issued, FertiNitro entered into a Stand Still Agreement
with its banks and bondholders which provided for the further continuation of the Offtake

Agreement; and that it was only terminated later for commercial reasons. '8?

The Tribunal notes that this Stand Still Agreement was apparently made in December 2010
by Pequiven for FertiNitro. It was not adduced in evidence by the Respondent in this
arbitration. The Claimants were not parties to this Stand Still Agreement. There is no
evidence that its terms were known at the time by KNI, save as Pequiven chose to describe

its effect to the Claimants.

In response to the Respondent’s case, the Claimants allege that the “post expropriation
product purchases made by KNI from FertiNitro were made pursuant to a new ad hoc
arrangement”.!** They claim that “after the expropriation, the bondholders and creditors
continued to look to the product purchases and the revenues they generated, continued to
have power, through the trustee, over the Offshore Accounts, and could have exercised

remedies, including assuming control of the plant in the event [of default].”!*?

The Tribunal finds, on the limited evidence adduced in this arbitration, that the
Respondent’s conduct was ambiguous, being dependent upon different perspectives. Even

from Pequiven’s own perspective, as Mr Barrientos acknowledged in his testimony:

5.88

“Without any doubt whatsoever, immediately after Decree 7713, a great deal of uncertainty
arose.”!9° Towards FertiNitro’s banks and bondholders, it became important for the
Respondent ostensibly to maintain the continuing efficacy of the Offtake Agreement, as
apparently achieved by the Stand Still Agreement, so as to avoid a cross-default under the
Common Security Agreement and other agreements with the banks and bondholders. From
the Respondent’s perspective towards KNI, there was there no such necessity. The Tribunal

returns to KNI’s position in Part VII below.

(vi) The “Historical Claims” (as regards Taxes and VAT)

As summarised in Part II above, KOMSA advances claims relating to three tax related

measures and VAT credits, as part of its “Historical Claims”.

New Taxes: In August 2005, the Respondent enacted the Organic Law on Science,
Technology and Innovation (Ley Orgdnica de Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacién) (“Science

and Technology Law”).!?!

In accordance with Articles 35 and 42 of this Law, “large
companies in the country dealing with the activities established in the Organic Law on
Hydrocarbons and Gaseous Hydrocarbons” shall donate two per cent of their gross revenue
obtained in the Venezuelan territory, to activities that would be “considered to be
Contributions and Investments in Science, Technology and Innovations and their
Application.”'°* According to the Respondent, Article 39 of the Science and Technology

Law provides that contributions can be tax deductible.!%

This Science and Technology Law, a law of general application, was being implemented
before FertiNitro began to operate and upon FertiNitro’s initiation of operations it also
became applicable to it. After the enactment of the 2009 Petrochemical Law, FertiNitro’s

contribution rate under the Science and Technology Law was reduced from 2% to 0.5%,

because petrochemical activities stopped being categorized as an activity within the

Hydrocarbon sector. !°+

5.89 According to the Claimants, the total amount that FertiNitro contributed in compliance
with the Science and Technology Law in the period 2006-2010 amounted to approximately
US$ 22.35 million.'°> According to the Respondent “FertiNitro’s contributions were

9196

almost exclusively invested internally, and “on rare occasions, [FertiNitro] contributed

to a public project.”!°”

5.90 Increased Taxes: On 30 December 2005, the municipality of Simon Bolivar, in the State
of Anzoategui (where the FertiNitro Plant is located), issued an ordinance that set or
modified the tax rate applicable to all companies considered to be in the “industrial,
commercial, service or similar economic activities” in the municipality (the “Municipal
Ordinance”). '°8 The Municipal Ordinance, applicable to FertiNitro for the 2006 fiscal year,

established an increase in the municipal tax rate from 1% to 4%.'°°

5.91 Pursuant to the Municipal Ordinance “[a]ll industrial economic activities exercised by
consortium or any other kind of association [...] of the Energy Natural Gas Production
Sector and all activities related to the oil and gas and petrochemical industry [...] linked to
the activity that is directly or indirectly related to the Jose Petrochemical Complex” would
be subject to a 4% tax rate over the company’s gross revenue.”” The Parties disagree on
which types of companies are located in the Jose Petrochemical complex and would be

affected by the Ordinance.””!

5.92 In 2006, before FertiNitro would start paying the taxes at the higher rate, Pequiven engaged
in negotiations with the municipality to reduce the municipal tax for all the mixed
companies in which Pequiven had equity investments, including FertiNitro, Metor,
Superoctoanos and Supermetanol.” FertiNitro’s Board agreed to entrust Pequiven to

handle such negotiations.?">

5.93 In connection with these negotiations, on 14 November 2006, the Municipality issued a
decree pursuant to which FertiNitro would be applied a 2% municipal tax for 2006 and
2.4% for 2007, instead of 4% (the “Municipal Decree”).7** The Decree was formally
notified to FertiNitro on 6 December 2006.75

5.94 On 14 December 2006, the FertiNitro Board of Directors Meeting issued a Resolution that

“ratified the General Management’s decision to accept the 2% rate for 2006 and approved

accepting the 2.4% rate for 2007.”?°°

5.95 VAT: As an exporter from Venezuela, FertiNitro had the right under Venezuelan law to
recover credits for VATs borne for the acquisition and import of goods and services used
in the manufacture of goods for export.?°’ Such tax credits were provided in the form of
Special Certificates of Tax Refunds (or “CERTS” for the Spanish acronym) and were
governed by the Law of May 1999 on Partial Reform of the Law on Value Added Tax (the
“VAT Law”).2°5 CERTS could “be used or assigned for the payment of national taxes [...]

tax liability, tax penalties and procedural expenses.”?°” CERTS are issued in Bolivares and

rejects this characterisation and asserts that the Ordinance was applicable to “all companies operating in the

Municipality of Sim6n Bolivar”, which includes mixed-owned companies, located in the Jose Complex (Resp. C-

Mem., Paragraph 125; Resp. Rej., Paragraph 177).

5.96 Ms Carolina Nunez, a former SENIAT employee, testified that: “[b]etween 2007 to 2012,
the process took as long as two or three years from submission of a request to final issuance

of a CERT” (even though the Law prescribes a 30-day period); and it affected all tax payers

equally.?!°

5.97 During the course of its operations, FertiNitro regularly submitted request for
reimbursements to the Respondent’s competent authorities. On or around 2007 and
thereafter, the Respondent’s tax authorities failed to issue certain of the requested CERTS

to FertiNitro on a timely basis.7!! FertiNitro complained to the relevant tax authorities.?!?

5.98 The Parties disagree on whether the requested VAT credits were ultimately granted to

FertiNitro. According to the Respondent, “each of the VAT credits claimed by the

issued to FertiNitro could differ from the amount initially requested; and that FertiNitro

never complained about those differences.?!+

PART VI: JURISDICTION ISSUES

Introduction

The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal
ratione materiae, alleging that the Offtake Agreement does not constitute an “investment”
under both the Treaty and the ICSID Convention; and that the Tribunal has therefore no
competence, or jurisdiction, to decide KNI’s claims against the Respondent in this
arbitration. As already indicated, the Respondent makes no jurisdictional objection to

KOMSA’s claims.

For present purposes, the Respondent’s principal submissions can be summarised briefly
as follows: (i) there is an inherent meaning of the term “investment,” under both Article
25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(2) the Treaty, which requires among others,
a contribution and risk; (ii) KNI has neither made a contribution, nor incurred the type of
tisk necessary to qualify as an “investment”; (iii) the Offtake Agreement is a simple
commercial sales contract and the complexity, length and project finance implications or
the general unity of the investment concept don’t transform it into an “investment”; (iv)
the Offtake Agreement fails to meet the territoriality requirement of Article 2 of the Treaty
as it has not provided any benefit in Venezuela; and (v) KNI’s claim is covered by the
dispute resolution provisions in Article 12 of the Offtake Agreement, providing for the

resolution of “any dispute” relating to that agreement, including its termination.

KNI’s principal submissions in response, asserting the jurisdiction and competence of
ICSID and the Tribunal, can also be summarised briefly as follows: (i) it is far from well-
settled that an “objective and inherent” meaning of “investment” under the ICSID
Convention can supplant the scope of the treaty parties’ consent as to the meaning of an
“investment” in the treaty; (ii) there is no requirement under this Treaty or the ICSID
Convention to make a contribution to Venezuela’s development; these factors as to
contribution and risk are not strict jurisdictional requirements, but simply indicia or
“hallmarks” of investments under the ICSID Convention; (iii) in any event, the Offtake

Agreement satisfies these factors as to both contribution and risk; (iv) international law

106

6.4

6.6

prescribes that investment transactions be viewed in their totality; and therefore the Offtake
Agreement cannot be considered as a commercial contract in isolation from the entire
FertiNitro project, but instead as an integral and critical part of that project’s financing,
structure, profitability and purpose; (v) Article 2 of the Treaty is a standard clause that
“merely establishes the temporal scope and subject-matter of the Treaty”, and it cannot be
interpreted as incorporating a requirements that the Treaty contribute to the host State’s
development; and (vi) KNI’s rights under the Offtake Agreement and under the Treaty are
conceptually distinct; and the dispute resolution provisions in Article 12 of the Offtake
Agreement do not cover KNI’s claim against the Respondent arising out of the Treaty

under international law.

It is necessary to develop certain of these submissions further below, for the Respondent
and KNI in turn. The Tribunal has considered in full the factual and legal materials
presented by the Parties relating to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection. The Tribunal
here addresses only the materials that it considers to be determinative factors in deciding

that objection to KNI’s claim.

The Respondent’s Case

“Investment”: The Respondent submits that the term “investment” has an objective and
inherent meaning both under (i) the Treaty and (ii) the ICSID Convention. The burden of
proof lies with the alleged investor asserting the alleged investment, who must demonstrate
that is has made the alleged investment within the meaning of both the Treaty and the

ICSID Convention.?'®

With regard to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Respondent asserts that
arbitration tribunals, including Global Trading v. Ukraine, Joy Mining v. Egypt, and Saba
Fakes v. Turkey, have recognised that the term “investment” has an objective meaning
under the ICSID Convention, or in the words of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention

on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”), an “ordinary meaning” which cannot be established only

by reference to the Treaty, as an instrument of consent.!? It cites the tribunal’s decision in
GEA Group v. Ukraine, for the proposition that “is not so much the term ‘investment’ in
the ICSID Convention than the term ‘investment’ per se that is often considered as having
an objective meaning in itself, whether it is mentioned in the ICSID Convention or in a
BIT.”220

6.7 As to the objective meaning in Article 1(2) of the Treaty, the Respondent asserts that: “[t]he
argument that ‘every kind of asset’ constitutes a protected ‘investment’ under the [Treaty]
is untenable.” It concludes: “[the] indicative list of the types of assets which the term may
cover [...] [is] not intended to mean that every one of the listed asset-type is an investment

in all circumstances. This is why the definition uses the phrase ‘investment includes’ rather

than ‘investment means,”””?!

6.8 The Respondent contends that KNI has not “made a contribution” or incurred an
“investment risk” in connection with the Offtake Agreement. The term “investment” has

the same inherent and objective meaning under both the ICSID Convention and the

222

Treaty.“~~ That meaning requires a contribution, duration and risk each of which is a sine

qua non requirement for the existence of an “investment.”??? The Respondent further

6.9 The Respondent acknowledges, as a fact, that KOMSA was an original party to the Offtake
Agreement. However, the Respondent contends that the assignment of rights and
obligations under the Offtake Agreement from KOMSA to KNI was part of an intra-
company restructuring; and that neither KOMSA nor its assignee, KNI, have made any
“contribution” or incurred any “risk” with respect to the Offtake Agreement, for the

purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(2) of the Treaty. 77°

6.10 Contribution: As to a relevant “contribution”, the Respondent asserts that KNI was created
primarily to sell and distribute offtake from the FertiNitro Plant to North America; but that
KNI made no “contribution”; and it did not “engage in the action of investing,” when it
was assigned KOMSA’s contractual interest in the Offtake Agreement.???, KOMSA’s
investment, for its part, related to the formation of the joint venture comprising the
FertiNitro project; and the Offtake Agreement was an ancillary sales contract signed by the
joint venture with KOMSA for the purchase of urea and ammonia. There was never a
contribution by KOMSA that related to the Offtake Agreement that could have been
transferred to KNI along with KOMSA’’s interests in that sales contract.?* The Respondent
submits that the performance of the Offtake Agreement does not qualify as a contribution,

which must be made at its inception and not with hindsight.?”?

rather than simple passive ownership. It concludes that the mere acceptance of

contractual rights and obligations, asset and ownership of shares is not sufficient to

constitute an investment or prove a contribution of money or assets.”*!

6.12 Risk: As to a relevant “risk”, the Respondent contends that the risks alleged by the
Claimants, such as the demand risk, price risk, counterparty risk and non-performance risk
do not go beyond the ordinary risks of a counter-party’s non-performance of a commercial

contract. These are purely commercial risks generally associated with doing business.

6.13 The Respondent also contends that these commercial risks would be covered and largely

233

mitigated by the provisions of the Offtake Agreement. Moreover, since KNI was

guaranteed offtake at a pre-determined discount price, “[t]he entire price risk remained
with the producer, FertiNitro.” In addition, under the terms of the Offtake Agreement,
KOMSA guaranteed KNI’s obligation under the Offtake Agreement and any risks
associated to it. ?*+ The Respondent notes that in the unlikely event of a total collapse of

the “international demand” for the FertiNitro project’s output, “the price mechanism would

deprive the take-or-pay provision of the Offtake Agreement of any effect.”?°>

6.14 The Respondent submits that the Offtake Agreement was a mere commercial sales
contract; and that the complexity, length, project finance implications or the ‘unity of

investment concept’ do not transform the Offtake Agreement into an “investment”. The

Offtake Agreement was and remained a classical sales contract, in the sense that KNI paid

a discounted price (fixed through a purchase price formula) in exchange of ammonia and

urea;?*° and payments were due in accordance with normal commercial terms.”

6.15 According to the Respondent, myriad legal materials, including the travaux préparatoires
for the ICSID Convention and scholarly commentators confirm that mere sales contracts,
as a type of commercial transaction, do not amount to “investments” within the meaning
of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.”** The Respondent also points to the decisions

in SGS v. Paraguay and MHS v. Malaysia, which confirmed that sale contracts are not

239

investments under international law,~”’ and to the ICSID Secretariat’s decision to refuse to

register a request on the basis that the underlying transaction could not be considered an

investment as it arose “out of a sale of goods transactions.””4°

6.16 Unity of Investment: The Respondent also asserts that applying the concept of the ‘unity of
investment’ in this case would improperly expand the scope of ICSID jurisdiction. Relying
on the decisions in ATA Constructions v. Jordan and CSOB vy. Slovak Republic, the
Respondent submits that to be part of an “investment”, the specific transactions “cannot be

disassociated from all other transactions involving the economic purpose of the

investment” and must be “inseparable from [the] others or comparatively free-standing.”7+!

achievable without the Offtake Agreement. The Offtake Agreement was not essential to a
single economic goal; and the Tribunal can “parse each component part of the overall
transaction” and examine whether it would satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of the

Treaty and the ICSID Convention.”4?

The Respondent contends that the equity interest of KOMSA and FertiNitro’s other
shareholders in FertiNitro was not impaired by the termination of the Offtake Agreement,
which demonstrates that the Offtake Agreement is ancillary and separable from the
FertiNitro project - unlike the factual background in the Jnmaris and Ambiente Ufficio
decisions.** The Offtake Agreement can be easily dissociated from the equity investment:
even if FertiNitro had not terminated the Offtake Agreement, KOMSA could still pursue
its investment claim in this arbitration.*“+ The Offtake Agreement has been critical for the
FertiNitro project, but it was not critical that the contract be concluded with KOMSA
specifically, just that there had to be a long-term offtake contract to secure payment of the
loans to finance the project. The Offtake Agreement was not an incentive to persuade

KOMSA to become a shareholder in FertiNitro.745

Article 2: The Respondent contends that Article 2 of the Treaty contains a territoriality
requirement not met by the Offtake Agreement. Article 2 of the Treaty provides that the
Treaty is only applicable to “investments in the territory of one Contracting Party.” The
territorial nexus is further highlighted by Articles 1, 3, 4, 7 and 8 and by the Preamble to
the Treaty, when it states the signatories’ intent to “assure favourable conditions for

investments [...] in the territory of the other Contracting Party.” (Emphasis added)

The Respondent further submits that arbitral tribunals have assessed the territorial nexus
by scrutinizing the beneficial value emanating from the investment to the host state.74° As

the Offtake Agreement “permitted less than 5% of total resales to be made domestically,

with the major portion of the offtake designated for re-sale overseas,””*’ the Offtake
Agreement’s benefit to Venezuela was minimal. Thus, it did not satisfy the Treaty’s

territorial requirement.

Article 12: The Respondent contends that the Offtake Agreement contains a multi-tier
forum selection clause for the resolutions of “any Dispute” relating to the Offtake
Agreement, including the present disputed claim made by KNI. Under Article 12 of the
Offtake Agreement, “any Dispute”, including claims for termination of the Offtake
Agreement, “would initially be subject to negotiation [...] [followed by] arbitration in
accordance with the ICC Rules” if the negotiations failed.48 Article 12, so it submits, is

not overridden by the Treaty.

The Respondent submits that the decision to terminate the Offtake Agreement was made
by FertiNitro’s Temporary Ad Hoc Trustees on commercial grounds. KNI has, at most, a
commercial dispute with FertiNitro concerning the allegedly wrongful termination of a
sales contract, which KNI has failed to pursue in accordance with the forum selection
clause of Article 12 of the Offtake Agreement. 249 Therefore, so the Respondent concludes,
this Tribunal lacks any jurisdiction to decide KNI’s claim.*? Although KNT has asserted a
breach of contract claim disguised as an expropriation claim, such a claim remains a
commercial dispute referable only to the Offtake Agreement’s forum selection clause in

Article 12.75!

The Claimants’ Case

“Investment”: KNI accepts that the Tribunal’s task of interpretation for the treaty and the
ICSID Convention should be guided by Article 31 of the VCLT. As to the Treaty,
according to KNI, “the ordinary meaning of Article 1(2) of the [Treaty] clearly and

unambiguously provides that contractual rights, such as those bestowed by the Offtake

Agreement, were contemplated as investments by the Contracting Parties.”??

Accordingly, so KNI submits, KNI’s rights to the supply of urea and ammonia under the
Offtake Agreement fall within the non-exhaustive chapeau of Article 1(2) of the Treaty:
“Tt]he term ‘investment’ comprises every kind of asset.” It also corresponds to the type of
investment defined in Article 1(2)(c) of the Treaty: “claims to money or to any performance
under a contract.”?? A fortiori, so KNI concludes, “given that ‘claims [...] to any
performance under a contract’ constitute an investment under the [Treaty], it follows that

contractual rights do as well.”?*4

KNI submits that any interpretation restricting the scope of the very broad, non-exhaustive
definition of “investment” in Article 1(2) of the Treaty would be contrary to the Treaty’s
plain language and its object and purpose, which is to promote investment.?> This was

accomplished, according to KNI, even if the Offtake were considered in isolation:

“Tt was a critical component that allowed FertiNitro to raise approximately USD 750
million in debt. This in turn allowed the construction of a substantial fertiliser plant,
which in turn allowed the Respondent to monetise natural gas that it would otherwise
have flared. Even assuming arguendo [that it was] a ‘mere’ sales agreement, the
Offtake Agreement was a long-term, twenty-year (or longer) agreement that required
significant outlays and risks to KNI, not the least because it required KNI to take or
pay for half the plant output regardless of actual need [as a purchaser].”?°°

As to the ICSID Convention, KNI contends that there is no objective and inherent
definition of the term “investment” in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; and that the

ICSID Convention defers to the parties’ consent to define the scope of an investment in the

Treaty.2°’ According to KNI:

“[R]ecent case law confirms the primacy of a [Treaty] over the ICSID Convention
when determining the scope of the applicable consent to ICSID arbitration and that

a claimant is not required to establish the existence of an ‘investment’ both under a
relevant investment treaty and under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.””°*

6.26 KNI further contends:

“[I]n the absence of restrictions to consent under Article 25(4) [affording States the
possibility of restricting ICSID jurisdiction ratione materiae to certain type of
investments], the scope of the term ‘investment’ should be construed within the
contours defined by the [relevant States in the relevant instrument].”??

6.27. Thus, KNI alleges, in the absence of restrictions under Article 25(4) of the ICSID
Convention and considering the primacy of the Treaty definition of “investment,” KNI’s
contractual rights clearly fall within the definition of “investment” under the ICSID

260

Convention. KNI rejects the argument that the definition of investment under Article

25 of the ICSID Convention can be confined to certain “outer-limits,” as such a concept
would not be faithful to the ordinary meaning, immediate context or object and purpose of
this provision.?°! Similarly, so KNI contends, the enumerated definition of investment in
Article 1(2) of the Treaty, cannot be substituted by an alleged “objective and inherent”
definition as argued by the Respondent. This would transgress the rules of interpretation
of customary international law codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.”®? KNI thus
contends that its rights under the Offtake Agreement qualify as an “investment” under both
the ICSID Convention and the Treaty, and that such rights also satisfy non-jurisdictional

indicia.

the ‘essential requirement of consent by the parties’ and, second, to the ‘mechanism’ of Art. 25(4) of the ICSID
Convention (See Cls. Reply, Paragraph 349 (citation omitted)).

KNI contends that the ordinary meaning of the term “investment” must also be interpreted
in the broader context of the provision in which it is found and the rest of the treaty’s
text. Even if the Offtake Agreement were considered separately from the rest of the
FertiNitro project, instead of an integral part, it would still qualify on its own as an
investment under both the ICSID Convention and the Treaty. According to KNI, the Salini
criteria are not jurisdictional requirements, but instead simple indicia or ‘hallmarks’ of
investments under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, to which tribunals attached a
variety of weight.?° Moreover, it is well established that the Salini elements “should be
viewed collectively under a balancing test, rather than requiring that all elements be
fulfilled or that any one criterion is more important than any other.”?° KNI concludes that
it made an “investment” under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention; and that its
investment fully satisfied the Salini criteria of duration, risk, contribution, economic

development, territorial nexus and regularity of profit and return.

Contribution: As to a relevant “contribution”, KNI contends that KOMSA made a
substantial initial contribution of equity to the FertiNitro project, of which KOMSA’s
original share was thirty-five percent; 7°” and that KOMSA later assigned its rights and
obligations under the Offtake Agreement to KNI in April 2003. Thus, the same initial
investor (KOMSA) made the initial contribution with respect to both the equity investment
and the Offtake Agreement and all that later transpired was an assignment of rights and

obligations as part of an internal structuring of the investment, to KNI.?6

KNI submits that the assignment, as an essential part of restructuring, is completely
acceptable under international investment law and does not undermine the subsequent

holder’s substantive and procedural protection under a treaty, so long as there is an

unbroken continuum in nationality.2 KNI further submits that KOMSA’s (and
subsequently KNI’s) legal commitment to take half of the FertiNitro Plant’s output under
the Offtake Agreement was a contribution in its own right; that KNI agreed to purchase
vast quantities of output for two decades; and that it was this commitment that enabled the
FertiNitro Plant to be financed, constructed and operated with the support of international

credit from banks and other lending institutions.

6.31 KNI rejects the Respondent’s reliance on the decision in Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka for
the proposition that the existence of an investment must be assessed “at its inception and
not with hindsight.” According to KNI, the issue whether an investor has made a
contribution must be assessed “at the time the proceedings are instituted”, as with any other

jurisdictional criteria. Whether the contribution existed from the initiation of the

investment is irrelevant, as the contribution may extend over a certain period of time.?”°

6.32 KNTalso submits that: that “there is no requirement under either the ICSID Convention or
the [Treaty] for KNI to have engaged in the ‘action of investing’ [or make a ‘fresh

that successors in interest to such assets have made further ‘contributions.’”?””

terms, but it can take a majority of forms, including know-how, equipment, personnel and

services. On this basis, “KNI and its personnel made an invaluable contribution to the
FertiNitro project through the performance of the Offtake Agreement.”?”>

Risk: As to relevant “risk”, KNI alleges that KNI’s risks under the Offtake Agreement were
not limited to the risk of non-performance identified in the SGS v. Paraguay and Romak v.
Uzbekistan cases cited by the Respondent. KNI’s risks under the Offtake Agreement
included “investment risk” defined by the Romak tribunal as: “a situation in which the
investor cannot be sure of a return on his investment, and may not know the amount he will

end up spending, even if all relevant counterparties discharge their contractual

obligations.”?”*

KNI seeks further support from Mr Sorlie’s witness statement adduced in this arbitration,

where he testified as follows:

“KNI took on certain economic risks with respect to the Offtake Agreement; risks
that would have been borne by FertiNitro (and indirectly by the equity holders)
without the existence of the Offtake Agreement. For example, KNI took on market
risk associated with agreeing to a “take-or-pay” obligation. This meant that as long
as FertiNitro could produce and tender product, KNI was under the obligation to
take and pay or not take, but still pay for the product regardless of the market
conditions. These market risks included: demand risk - the risk that the market
demand for the product may be very low, resulting in a difficulty finding a
counterparty interested in taking the product, price risk - closely related to demand
risk, KNI faced the risk of market price fluctuations, and counterparty risk - this is
the risk that KNI’s ultimate counterparty fails to perform, such as the failure to pay
for product in a timely fashion. These market risks apply also to the freight market
which would include the additional risks associated with transporting goods,
including the increased risks associated with transporting ammonia.”?">

KNI also refers to KOMSA’s guarantee of KNI’s obligations under the Offtake Agreement,

annulling any risks associated with the Offtake Agreement because KNI would still be

responsible in the case that KOMSA was insolvent. Moreover, if KOMSA did have to
satisfy KNI’s obligations at any point, KOMSA could have sought indemnification from
KNI:?”6 “Once risk pertaining to that investment has been identified, [...] there is no cause
to search for additional risks born by subsequent assignees as the risks entailed in the

original investment have not dissipated.” 7””

6.37 Unity of Investment: If the Offtake Agreement were not to be viewed as an “investment”

in isolation (contrary to KNI’s primary case), KNI submits that the Offtake Agreement was
an “integral part” of the overall investment and structure of the FertiNitro project and that
it cannot be dismissed as a separate sales contract not qualifying as an investment.?’* The
Offtake Agreement was not a “one-off” sales agreement; but instead, as is the case for all
offtake agreements in project financing, it was a long term, take-or-pay sales agreement
for the output of a particular plant put in place to secure financing for the FertiNitro

project.?”

6.38 Under the ICSID Convention and the Treaty, an investment operation must be considered

in its totality, without looking at each specific transaction that composes “the overall
operation.”?*° KNI relies upon the decisions in Inmaris v. Ukraine and Ambiente Ufficio
v. Argentina for the proposition that, for jurisdictional purposes, an investment must be
evaluated in a “holistic manner’, considering its “economic substance” and its “larger

context.”78!

contracts share identical economic objectives and rights, but instead, whether the dispute

arises directly out of the totality of the investment.** The fact that the Offtake

Agreement’s purpose was the purchase and sale of ammonia and urea, instead of the
construction, ownership and operation of the FertiNitro Plant, (as was the purpose of the
JIA) is irrelevant. KNI asserts that “the purpose of the project was not simply to build the
plant but to operate it and sell its output, an objective KNI helped FertiNitro achieve
through the Offtake Agreement.”** In the present case, the dispute arises out of the totality
of the investment, of which the Offtake Agreement is an inseparable part. Relying on the
decisions in Mytilineos, Electrabel and CSOB, KNI submits that the Tribunal should take

a “holistic view” of the Claimants’ investment.?**

KNI contends that “KOMSA’s equity investment and KOMSA’s (later KNI’s) offtake
commitment were interdependent and inseparable. [...] [A]ll parties viewed the equity and

offtake investments as a ‘package deal.’”?*°

Since KOMSA and Pequiven pursued a
project finance model, “the Offtake Agreement was essential to properly allocating the
project’s overall risk and, by extension, to securing financing from international
lenders.”?8° Besides being an equity investor, KOMSA was interested in FertiNitro as a
new source of ammonia and urea for its fertiliser sales and trading business and
operations.**”7 One of KOMSA’s central investment objectives was to obtain offtake at
below market price, coupled with the ability to trade that product in assigned geographic
areas.*88 Thus, “in addition to mitigating project risk, without the economic value of the

Offtake Agreement, ‘KOMSA would not have made its investment in FertiNitro;’”?°? “nor

would the [FertiNitro] project have received the necessary financing from international

markets necessary to its completion and ultimate success.”?”

6.41  KNI asserts that the FertiNitro project consisted of a bundle of integrated, interwoven
contracts signed on the same day and defined as the “Project Documents,” each of which
did not stand on its own, as is clear from the documentary evidence, the expert evidence

and the witness testimony.”*!

KNI relies on the expert testimony of Professor Esty who
considered the Offtake Agreement to be “a critical, integrated and economically
inseparable” of the overall FertiNitro project.’ In any case, so KNI submits, KNI need
not prove that the Offtake Agreement was essential to the realisation of the FertiNitro

project for it to be an integral part of the overall economic transaction.”

6.42 In project finance, so KNI maintains, because there is no recourse beyond the project itself,
the lender and bond holders “look primarily to the cash flow from the project as the source
of funds to service their loans.”?** As such, offtake agreements are typically the primary
source of project revenues. This Offtake Agreement guaranteed the FertiNitro project’s
income stream and the payments by the Offtakers were remitted to an escrow account
managed by the lenders.”*° In particular, “[t]he lenders relied on the Offtake Agreement
to establish an assured distribution channel for the plant’s output as well as on the credit
support, liquidity and currency risk mitigation inherent in the obligations of the Offtakers
to take and pay for product tendered by the [FertiNitro] plants.”?°° The Offtake Agreement
itself provides for “critical linkages between the project documents and serve to integrate

the Offtake Agreement with key rights and obligations of other parties, particularly the

sponsors and the lenders, under the other central project documents.”?*” This is confirmed
(inter alia) by Articles 11.4 and 11.5 of the Offtake Agreement.?* Pursuant to Article
11.4, if an Offtaker’s interest in FertiNitro fell below 20% of the equity, FertiNitro had the
right to renegotiate the terms and conditions of the Offtake Agreement with respect to that
buyer. Under Article 11.5, if the equity interest fell below 5%, the respective right and
obligations of the Offtaker under the Offtake Agreement would be terminated.” In
addition, the duration of KNI’s obligations under the Offtake Agreement was tied directly
to the status of the project debt. The original term of 20 years under the Offtake Agreement

was to be extended in the event that bonds were still outstanding.*”

KNI distinguishes this case from the facts in Joy Mining and Global Trading v. Ukraine
cases, alleging that the Offtake Agreement was a much more important part of the overall
FertiNitro project than the contract at issue in Joy Mining. In Global Trading, the tribunal
adopted a pragmatic approach when considering whether the sale of poultry could be an
investment; and it did not categorically exclude all purely commercial transactions from

the definition of investment.*°!

Article 2: KNI contends that the Offtake Agreement was an “[investment] in the territory
of one Contracting Party made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of
the other Contracting Party” in accordance with Article 2 of the Treaty. According to KNI,
Article 2 of the Treaty is a standard clause in bilateral investment treaties that “merely
establishes the temporal scope and subject-matter of the Treaty.”*"? This provision cannot
be interpreted as incorporating requirements that the investment contribute to the host
State’s economic development. Moreover, such a developmental requirement has been
dismissed by many tribunals, given its highly subjective nature.*°? In addition, the cases

on which the Respondent attempts to rely “focus on geographical connections where an

investment’s impact was felt,” and not upon whether the investment benefited the host

government.*°*

6.45 In any event, so KNI submits, the Respondent’s argument should be dismissed as “the
project was forecasted to bring and has indeed brought, considerable benefits to the local
population and the country writ large, particularly through its monetisation at considerable
prices of natural gas that would otherwise have been flared and payment of various national

taxes.”°05 Further,

“After passing through the off-shore accounts and the project waterfall, a portion of
the proceeds of the offtake — the net income — would make their way to FertiNitro in
Venezuela. There were also derivative domestic sales in Venezuela. The Offtake
Agreement clearly had an impact in Venezuela that more than satisfies any
territoriality requirement.”°*°
6.46 Article 12: KNI contends that the dispute resolution provisions in Article 12 of the Offtake
Agreement do not prevent the Tribunal from deciding KNI’s claim against the Respondent
under the Treaty. Article 41 of the ICSID Convention empowers this Tribunal to determine

its own jurisdiction.

6.47 KNI submits that KNI’s rights under the Offtake Agreement and under the Treaty are
conceptually distinct. Article 12 of the Offtake Agreement relates only to commercial
arbitration for contractual disputes between its contracting parties, that is FertiNitro,
Pequiven, IPSL and KNI. By contrast, this dispute involves claims under international law
brought by KNI against the Respondent on the basis of the Respondent’s consent to ICSID
jurisdiction in the Treaty regarding its unlawful expropriation of KNI’s investment under
the Treaty. Thus, the Offtake Agreement’s commercial arbitration clause has no effect on

the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.*””

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Tribunal starts with Article 41 of the ICID Convention. It is not disputed between the
Parties, nor could it be, that the Tribunal “shall be the judge of its own competence.” As
already indicated, this issue of jurisdiction concerns KNI and the Respondent, regarding
KNI’s claim for the alleged unlawful expropriation under Article 6 of the Treaty of its

alleged investment comprising its interest in the Offtake Agreement.*”

The Respondent’s jurisdictional objections relate only to KNI’s claim. In the Tribunal’s
view, the Respondent was right not to advance any like jurisdictional objection to
KOMSA’s claims in this arbitration: it is manifest that KOMSA made an “investment” as
an indirect shareholder in FertiNitro from the outset of the FertiNitro project, within the

meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(2) of the Treaty.

The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s submission that KNI must satisfy the definitions of
“investment” in both the Treaty and the ICSID Convention, as to which KNI bears the legal
burden of proving its case on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. It is a double test, each limb of
which KNI must establish, applying the customary rules of international law for treaty
interpretation codified in the VCLT, in particular Article 31 (1), whereby “[a] treaty shall
be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the

terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”

This double test was described in Paragraph 25 of the Executive Directors’ Report on the

ICSID Convention:

“While consent of the parties is an essential prerequisite for the jurisdiction of the
Centre, consent alone will not suffice to bring a dispute within its jurisdiction. In
keeping with the purpose of the Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre is further
limited by reference to the nature of the dispute and the parties thereto.”>”

6.54

More recently, the editors of Schreuer have commented:

“If jurisdiction is to be based on a treaty containing an offer of consent, the treaty’s
definition of investment will be relevant. In addition, the tribunal will have to
establish that the activity is an investment in the sense of the [ICSID] Convention.
This dual test has at times been referred to as the ‘double keyhole’ approach or as a
‘double-barreled’ test.”>'°

The Tribunal turns to the Treaty, as the first part of this dual test.

The Treaty: The Tribunal accepts KNI’s submission that the definition of “investment” in
Article 1(2) of the Treaty is very broad. Its opening words succinctly define “investment”
as including “every kind of asset.”. In the Tribunal’s view, this wording does not permit
additional requirements not implicit in the meaning of the word “investment”. However,
in the list that follows, there are five particular, non-exhaustive examples of such assets
satisfying the definition of “investment.” KNI relies on Articles 1(2)(b) and (c) of the
Treaty listing “shares, parts [sic] or any other kinds of participation in a company” and

“claims to [...] any performance under a contract.”

For the present case, subject to Article 2 of the Treaty and the ICSID Convention
(considered below), the Tribunal considers that its jurisdiction as to a covered “investment”
under the Treaty is established under Articles 1(2)(b) and (c) of the Treaty. The Treaty
expressly there defines shares or participation in a company and contractual performance
as an asset meeting its own definition of “investment.” The ordinary meaning of these
words, in their context and in the light of the Treaty’s object and purpose under Article 31

of the VCLT, is unambiguous.

As was decided in Rosinvest v. Russia on the interpretation of a similarly broad definition

of an investment:

“The very wide wording of that definition does not contain any term limiting
‘investment’ to something created under applicable national law. The definition
states that ‘investment’ means every kind of asset and goes on to set out a non-
exhaustive list of types of asset including ‘shares in, and stock, bonds and debentures

80 ICSID Convention: A Commentary (CLA-3), page 117.

125

6.55

6.56

6.57

of, and any other form of participation in, a company or business enterprise’. In
drafting this straightforward and very wide definition, the State parties to the IPPA
[the BIT between the UK and the USSR] clearly expressed the intention that any asset

should be included and the Tribunal considers Claimant’s holding of Yukos shares

to be such an asset.”?"!

In these circumstances, it would be inappropriate, under Article 31 of the VLCT or
otherwise, to add to this express definition and specific examples any other requirement.
However, even if this result were wrong in treating KNI’s “investment” on a stand-alone
basis, the same result is nonetheless achieved under Article 1(2) of the Treaty by applying
the concept of “unity of investment”, as considered below under Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention.

The ICSID Convention: The Tribunal interprets Article 1(2) of the Treaty independently
from Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, whilst bearing in mind the admonition in the

annulment decision in MHS v. Malaysia:

“Tt is those bilateral and multilateral treaties which today are the engine of ICSID’s
effective jurisdiction. To ignore or depreciate the importance of the jurisdiction they
bestow upon ICSID, and rather to embroider upon questionable interpretations of
the term ‘investment’ as found in Article 25(1) of the Convention, risks crippling the

institution.”>'?

Hence, the issue of the Tribunal’s disputed jurisdiction must turn next upon the meaning

of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as the second part of this ‘dual test’.

The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s legal submission that a “pure sales contract” cannot,
by itself, satisfy the meaning of “investment” in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.
However, as was decided in Pantechniki v. Albania: that submission “may quickly lose

traction in the reality of economic life.”?!

6.58

6.59

In the Tribunal’s view, the Offtake Agreement was not a “pure sales contract” legally or
economically. It is, on the evidence, impossible to separate it out as a separate stand-alone
transaction wholly unrelated to the overall FertiNitro project, which was, by any standards,

a legal and economic behemoth. As was decided in CSOB v. Slovakia:

“An investment is frequently a rather complex operation, composed of various
interrelated transactions, each element of which, standing alone, might not in all
cases qualify as an investment. Hence, a dispute that is brought before the Centre
must be deemed to arise directly out of an investment even when it is based on a
transaction which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment under the
Convention, provided that the particular transaction forms an integral part of an
overall of ion that lifies as an i [...] The foregoing analysis
indicates that the term ‘directly’, as used in Article 25(1) of the Convention, should
not be interpreted restrictively to compel the conclusion that CSOB’s claim is outside
the Centre’s jurisdiction and the Tribunal’s competence merely because it is based

on an obligation of the Slovak Republic which, standing alone, does not qualify as
314

 

an investment.

Other arbitration tribunals have adopted the same holistic approach to the meaning of
“investment” in Article 25(1) of the ICID Convention, without necessarily using that term
or the similar term “unity of investment”. The Tribunal refers to the decisions in Jnmaris
v. Ukraine,>'> where the tribunal considered the “claimed investments as component parts
of a larger, integrated investment undertaking”, Ambiente Ufficio v. Argentina, *'° where
the tribunal stated that “when a tribunal is in presence of a complex operation, it is required
to look at the economic substance of the operation in question in a holistic manner”; ADC

Affiliate v. Hungary,"

where the tribunal looked “at the totality of the transaction as
encompassed by the Project Agreements”; Electrabel v. Hungary,*'® where the tribunal
decided that “all the elements of the Claimant’s operation must be considered for the

purpose of determining whether there is an investment under Article 25”; and Chevron v.

Ecuador,>"? where it was said that “[i]nvestments must also be examined holistically and
not separated into components.” It is thus not permissible to slice up an overall investment
into its constituent parts, like a sausage, so as to contend that one part, isolated by itself

alone, is not an “investment” whereas as an integrated part of the whole investment, it is.

The question remains whether the Offtake Agreement was an integral part of KOMSA’s
original investment in the overall FertiNitro project. The Tribunal notes, again, that the
Respondent does not contend that KOMSA was not an investor with an investment under
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as regards its equity interest in the FertiNitro

project. (The Tribunal returns to KNI’s position as KOMSA’s assignee later below.)

In the Tribunal’s view, the economic evidence is overwhelming. Professor Esty (of
Harvard University and an expert on business economics) testified that an offtake
agreement “is a critical, integrated, and economically inseparable part of a project
company, and is viewed this way by all project participants including lenders, sponsors and

credit analysts;”>?°

this Offtake Agreement “was a critical, integrated and economically
inseparable part of the FertiNitro project company;” it was also critical “to the project’s
success and its ability to pay expenses, service debt obligations and generate returns for

the sponsors and “T do not believe this project [the FertiNitro project] could have been

financed without an offtake agreement. In fact, the offtake agreement is precisely what

form of US$ 250 million as Bonds and US$ 450 million as Senior Bank Debt), secured

at the time, Moody’s rating of the FertiNitro project was materially influenced by the

Offtake Agreement.*?°

The Offtake Agreement was also legally integrated with the FertiNitro project. Its
preamble referred expressly to the JIA; Article 11.1 provided for a term of 20 years or until
FertiNitro had repaid its Bonds; and Articles 11.4 and 11.5 provided that output available
to offtake buyers was dependent upon continued levels of equity in FertiNitro by such
buyers.*”* The Offtake Agreement also referred to other Project Documents: see Articles
3.2, and 4.2. In turn, Article IV of the JIA referred to the Offtake Agreement, where the
parties agreed that the Offtake Agreement was “necessary to give effect to this [JIA] [...]”
and “[...] necessary and appropriate to give effect to the intent of the Owners as expressed

in this [JIA] and to enable the construction of the Plants and operation of the Business.”

Section 3.01(b) and (c) of the Common Security Agreement with the Senior Banks
recorded FertiNitro’s representation that it had authority to enter into the Offtake
Agreement and that the Offtake Agreement was legally binding upon FertiNitro; Sections
5.01(b) and 5.03(b) required FertiNitro to give irrevocable instructions to Offtakers
(including KOMSA and later KNI) to make payments to offshore accounts in US dollars
under the Offtake Agreement, for the benefit of the lending banks (as earlier indicated in
the Bond Offering Circular);*° Section 6.01(a)(iii) recorded FertiNitro’s pledge to the
lending banks of all its rights in the Offtake Agreement; Section 9.01(c) made the Offtake
Agreement a condition precedent to the Common Security Agreement; and Section
10.01(g) made a default by KOMSA (later KNI) under the Offtake Agreement an event of

default by FertiNitro under the Common Security Agreement.*?°

The factual evidence from contemporary witnesses is consistent with this economic and
legal analysis. Mr Barrientos (of Pequiven) testified that the purpose of the Offtake
Agreement, although (in his legal view) a separate sales contract, “was to provide
FertiNitro a continuous revenue stream. This enabled FertiNitro to fulfill its obligations,
especially with banks and bondholders [...]. The Offtake Agreement was implemented

pursuant to this concept: it was not to ensure revenues to KOMSA or any shareholder in

particular.”*?7 At the time, FertiNitro’s US lawyers, Davis Polk & Wardwell, advised its
board of directors by letter dated 18 May 2005:°78

“As the Board will be aware, the terms of the current Offtake Agreement are the
product of extensive negotiations among the offtakers, the FertiNitro shareholders
and the FertiNitro creditors, are legally binding and reflect not only the fertilizer
market conditions existing or anticipated at the time, but also the overall contractual
[...] framework for the project and their attendant financial impact on the parties.
Therefore, any change to the Offtake Agreement cannot be viewed in isolation as a
negotiation between FertiNitro's shareholders and the offtakers but must also
account for the creditors as well as the prior and current roles of the participants in
capacities other than as shareholders and offtakers (for example, Pequiven and its
affiliates as the suppliers of feedstock and other services to the project and
Snamprogetti as the construction contractor for the project).

In particular, the lenders relied on the Offtake Agreement to establish an assured
distribution channel for the plant's output as well as on the credit support, liquidity
and currency risk mitigation inherent in the obligations of the offtakers to take and
pay for product tendered by the plants. The project's debt is secured by the
receivables owed by Koch and Pequiven to FertiNitro under the Offtake Agreement
(including a pledge by IPSL of its own receivables from export sales). The attributes
of the Offtake Agreement were fundamental to the lenders and the lenders view the
financial strength of the project as linked to the financial and marketing strength of
the offtakers and their respective commitments to the project.”

6.65 Mr Gwaltney (of Koch, and an alternate director of FertiNitro nominated by KOMSA)
testified that Offtake Agreement was “an integral part of the overall investment and
structure of the FertiNitro project. It was a ‘package deal’. KOMSA would obtain an equity
interest in the FertiNitro Companies and would also commit to purchasing offtake on a

long-term, take-or-pay basis.” He testified further:

“The Offtake Agreement was an essential element of Koch’s investment. Without
these valuable rights, KOMSA would not have made its investment in FertiNitro.
Furthermore, given that the Offtake Agreement obligated KNI to purchase product

from FertiNitro on a ‘take or pay’ basis and for an extended period of time, it satisfied

acritical requirement of the project finance lenders.”*?
Based on these materials, the Tribunal considers that the Offtake Agreement was an
integral and essential part of the overall investment made by KOMSA. It was not a distinct
or separate part, to be considered as a different unrelated transaction. Nor was it a ‘pure
sales contract’, whether judged from an economic, legal or broader commercial
perspective. Accordingly, whether KOMSA’s interest in the Offtake Agreement was an
investment under the ICSID Convention must stand or fall with KOMSA’s entire

transaction relating to the FertiNitro project.

In brief, the Tribunal concludes that KOMSA’s entire transaction, with its related equity
contribution and offtake rights and obligations, were part of a single integrated investment
within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Apart from the Offtake
Agreement (if a separate transaction which the Tribunal has here rejected), the Respondent
does not contend otherwise. As regards this single transaction (including the Offtake
Agreement), the Tribunal decides that it meets all the indicia of an investment as to
contribution, risk, duration and economic development under the Salini test, howsoever

applied.*°°

Article 2 of the Treaty: As an integral part of an entire transaction, the Tribunal accepts
KNI’s submission that the Offtake Agreement was an “[investment] in the territory of one
Contracting Party made in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the

other Contracting Party” in accordance with Article 2 of the Treaty.

Article 12: The Tribunal can also address summarily the Respondent’s reliance on the
dispute resolution provisions in Article 12 of the Offtake Agreement. Whilst possibly

relevant to issues of liability under Article 6 of the Treaty (to which the Tribunal returns

below), the Tribunal decides that these provisions do not support the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection. KNI’s claim is directed in this arbitration to the Respondent and
not FertiNitro, KNI invokes the Respondent’s obligations under the Treaty and
international law (as its applicable law), and not FertiNitro’s obligations under the Offtake
Agreement and New York law (as its applicable law). The causes of action, the legal texts,

the applicable laws and the disputing parties are thus all materially different.

Lastly, does it make a difference to any part of this analysis that KOMSA later assigned
(or novated) its interest in the Offtake Agreement to KNI, whereby (so it could be said) the
Offtake Agreement ceased to be part of an entire integrated investment? This question too
could have raised difficulties here, but for one important factor. The assignment from
KOMSA to KNI was an internal reorganization between associated companies within the
same Koch group of companies. It did not introduce an unrelated third party or materially
change the transaction. Nor could it have done so given Articles 11.4 and 11.5 of the
Offtake Agreement. The Respondent does not challenge the efficacy of the assignment
under the Offtake Agreement. Hence, although different in form, given the different legal
personalities of KOMSA and KNI, the assignment produced no material economic, legal

or commercial difference in substance.

Decision: In conclusion, for all these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection to KNI’s claim in this arbitration under Articles 1(2) and 2 of the

Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

PART VII: EXPROPIATION ISSUES

Introduction

As already indicated, the Claimants contend that the Respondent is liable under six
provisions of the Treaty; namely: (1) Article 6 (“Expropriation”), (2) Article 4(1) (“FET”),
(3) Article 4(1) (“FPS”) (4) Article 4(1) (“Arbitrary or Discriminatory Measures”); (5)
Article 4(2) (“National Treatment”); and (6) Article 11(2) (“Umbrella Clause”). In this
Part VII of the Award, the Tribunal addresses the issue of liability for the Claimants’ claims
for unlawful expropriation under Article 6 of the Treaty. The issues of liability for the

other non-expropriatory claims are addressed in Part VIII below.

It is again necessary to summarise the Parties’ respective cases as to the expropriation
issues. As with the jurisdictional issues and indeed all other issues, the Tribunal has
considered the Parties’ cases on liability in full; and it should not be assumed that the
omission from these summaries of any submission or other material invoked by any Party

has been overlooked by the Tribunal.

The Claimants’ Case

In summary, the Claimants contend that the wording of Article 6 of the Treaty captures
any taking of property, whether tangible or intangible, thus including shares, equity and
contractual interests; and that it prohibits expropriation unless a four-prong test is satisfied,
namely: (i) the measure must be taken in the public interest, (ii) on a non-discriminatory
basis, (iii) under due process of law, and (iv) with payment of compensation.**! The
Claimants then turn to the two alleged unlawful expropriations by the Respondent; namely:

KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro and KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement.**”

KOMSA: With regard to KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro, KOMSA submits that the
Respondent’s measure, Decree 7713 (the Expropriation Decree) read with the Minister’s

public statements, constituted an unlawful indirect expropriation. First, the Respondent

133

cannot prove the public interest prong because there was no shortage of fertilizer impacting
its domestic food production, and the taking was in any case disproportionate.**? Second,
the measure was discriminatory because it furthered Pequiven’s interests to the detriment
of all other shareholders in FertiNitro. KOMSA rejects the Respondent’s argument that
Pequiven and KOMSA were not similarly situated because they operated in different

4 Third, the measure breached due process

markets and thus were not competitors.**
because no advance notice was provided to KOMSA, the expropriation having been
notified during the President’s weekly television show during which the President signed
the Expropriation Decree. KOMSA rejects the Respondent’s argument that various
channels of information, including earlier threats or unrelated governmental actions, could
have constituted proper notice to KOMSA under international law.**> Fourth, no effective
compensation has ever been paid to KOMSA.**° KOMSA submits that Article 6 requires

effective compensation for the Respondent to discharge its obligations, not mere

negotiations or lengthy domestic litigation.**”

KNI: With regard to KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement, KNI submits that Decree
7713 constitutes an unlawful indirect expropriation for the same reasons as those submitted
by KOMSA. KNI contends that the Respondent nullified KNI’s rights to performance by
FertiNitro of the Offtake Agreement.*** The fact that the Offtake Agreement was only
terminated by FertiNitro in February 2012 (as contended by the-Respondent), many
months after the Expropriation Decree and the Minister’s statements is irrelevant,
according to KNI, because the substance of the Offtake Agreement had already been
adversely impacted on 11 October 2010 and, in any event, the later termination was
attributable to the Respondent (by its control of Pequiven and, consequentially,
FertiNitro).*° In addition, KNI rejects the Respondent’s argument that it did not

expropriate KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement because that argument is incompatible

with its public interest defence in defending FertiNitro’s expropriation. That defence relies
upon Venezuela’s alleged food production crisis that could only be mitigated if FertiNitro’s
performance of its contractual obligations towards KNI to acquire urea was also taken, i.e.
expropriated, by the Respondent.*#? As with KOMSA, the Respondent has paid no

compensation to KNI, as at the date of this Award.

The Respondent’s Case

In summary, the Respondent contends that Decree 7713 ordered the mandatory acquisition
of FertiNitro’s assets, in accordance with Venezuela’s domestic law and as expressly
authorised under Article 6 of the Treaty. It denies any liability under Article 6 to either
KOMSA or KNI.

KOMSA: The Respondent contends that this acquisition was carried out in the public
interest and for a public purpose, as to which States enjoy broad latitude under international
law. Specifically, the Respondent wished to ensure sovereign control over the means of
domestic food production. The Respondent contends that there is a direct link between the
fertilizer sector and food production. It points to the Venezuelan food crisis of 1998 and

the potential general impact of malnutrition on a country’s social peace.

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ heightened test according to which the Respondent
must also prove the underlying hardship that gave rise to the policy and prove that the new
policy is untainted by any political motives. It submits that the proportionality test asserted
by the Claimants is misplaced. It is here only relevant to determine whether certain
measures can rise to the level of expropriation. It has nothing to do with assessing the
Respondent’s food policy (which the Respondent submits was reasonable and

proportionate in any event).*4!

The Respondent contends that its acquisition of FertiNitro was carried out in a non-
discriminatory manner because Pequiven and KOMSA were not similarly situated. They

were not operating in the same markets, particularly with the Offtake Agreement. The

Respondent submits that merely acting in the same sector is not sufficient to be similarly
situated. Moreover, Pequiven is a state-owned entity that was in charge of promoting food
security (even before Decree 7713 was issued), whereas KOMSA is a private Swiss
company. Further, there was a reasonable justification for treating Pequiven and KOMSA
differently, given the policy of ensuring Venezuela’s food security. In addition, Pequiven
did not benefit from FertiNitro’s acquisition. That acquisition merely facilitated the
administrative process; and (ultimately) Pequiven had also to surrender its own equity
interest in FertiNitro, just like all other FertiNitro shareholders. There was thus no intent
by the Respondent specifically to target foreigners. Pequiven did not ultimately hold the

assets of FertiNitro; and KOMSA did not receive any differential adverse treatment. 342

The Respondent contends that the acquisition of FertiNitro was carried out under due
process. KOMSA had received multiple notices of the upcoming acquisition. In the
absence of any such language in Article 6, the Respondent challenges KOMSA’s argument
that prior notice is always required under a due process standard under international law.
The Respondent had earlier expressed strong interest in the fertilizer sector; and KOMSA
had received notice through various channels (including the press, Pequiven employees
and other laws or decrees) that showed the Respondent's interest in the sector. Moreover,
there were legal remedies available to KOMSA under domestic laws, including amicable

negotiations, to challenge the acquisition of FertiNitro.**

The Respondent contends that it met its obligations under international law and Article 6
because it offered to negotiate effective and adequate compensation for KOMSA. At that
time, only the amount of compensation, not the principle of compensation, was disputed
between the Respondent and KOMSA. Also, according to the Respondent, Article 6 does
not require immediate payment of compensation by the Respondent. The Respondent also
submits that Pequiven (for the Respondent) always negotiated in good faith and made a
reasonable offer of compensation, until KOMSA itself put an end to the negotiations.

Under international law, so the Respondent submits, where only the valuation of the asset

remains in dispute, the offer of compensation suffices for the State to discharge its
obligation regarding compensation under the treaty. The Respondent also submits that the
pending litigation before the Venezuelan courts regarding the amount of compensation will

lead to compensation to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimant in due course.*##

KNI: The Respondent contends that it did not expropriate KNI’s contractual interest in the
Offtake Agreement, even assuming (contrary to its jurisdictional objection) that such an

interest was an “investment” under the Treaty.

According to the Respondent, Decree 7713 does not include any language regarding KNI’s
contractual rights to buy urea and ammonia under the Offtake Agreement; KNI’s
contractual rights were unaffected by the Decree; and those rights were not an “asset” under

the Decree.

In addition, KNI continued to purchase such products under the Offtake Agreement after
October 2010. That was not done (as KNI asserts) under an ad hoc agreement made by an
exchange of letters after the Expropriation Decree 7713 was issued. KNI’s interest in the
Offtake Agreement was thus not expropriated by Decree 7713. The Respondent challenges
the testimony of the Claimants’ witnesses according to which KNI was confused by the
Decree and had understood the Offtake Agreement to be expropriated, thus requiring
products to be delivered under a new ad hoc agreement for the future. The Respondent
submits that there is no convincing evidence supporting KNI’s position. Ultimately, so the
Respondent contends, FertiNitro (but not the Respondent) terminated the Offtake

Agreement for its own clearly stated commercial reasons in February 2012.*4>

In any event, so the Respondent further contends, the alleged treatment of KNI’s interest
in the Offtake Agreement cannot be attributed to the Respondent under international law
because FertiNitro was not part of the Respondent’s organic structure, does not exercise

governmental powers, nor was it under the effective control of the Respondent. Pequiven

was the only entity that administratively managed the acquisition of FertiNitro, without

ultimately holding the assets.*#°

The termination of the Offtake Agreement by FertiNitro in February 2012 was a
commercial decision that cannot be qualified as an expropriation under Article 6 of the
Treaty; nor can it give rise to any liability under international law because it would be, at
most, an ordinary contractual breach by FertiNitro that cannot amount to any “taking” by

the Respondent under the Treaty.*4”

The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal’s starting-point is necessarily the Respondent’s state policies on food security
and domestic food production for the people of Venezuela, pre-dating Decree 7713 (the
Expropriation Decree dated 10 October 2010). These policies are ostensibly laudable, with
their origins pre-dating the Claimants’ investments. In the Tribunal’s view, short of the
Expropriation Decree of 10 October 2010, there is nothing in these governmental policies
that, by themselves, amount to a violation of the Claimants’ rights under Article 6 of the
Treaty. The Tribunal accepts that these policies were adopted by the Respondent in good
faith, for a public purpose in feeding the people of Venezuela, in accordance with

Venezuelan law and falling within the boundaries of rationality.

Moreover, it is not the function of this Tribunal to second-guess the design or existence of
those policies under the Treaty, unless their execution by the Respondent actually violates
the rights of KOMSA or KNI under the Treaty. As to that, as the Claimants, KOMSA and
KNI bear the legal burden of proving their respective allegations in regard to the

Expropriation Decree and the Minister’s statements.

The bar for the Claimant’s claims is thus high under international law, as confirmed by a
‘jurisprudence constante’ established over many years. As was decided by the NAFTA

tribunal in Methanex v. USA,** an intentionally discriminatory regulation against a foreign

investor can fulfill a key requirement for establishing expropriation. However, it also

concluded:

“[A]s a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a
public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects,
inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and
compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating
government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the
government would refrain from such regulation.”

More recently, the tribunal in Philip Morris v. Uruguay decided:*“?

“As indicated by earlier investment treaty decisions, in order for a State’s action in
exercise of regulatory powers not to constitute indirect expropriation, the action has
to comply with certain conditions. Among those most commonly mentioned are that
the action must be taken bona fide for the purpose of protecting the public welfare,
[and] must be non-discriminatory and proportionate.”

7.20 Accordingly, the standard of review of a State’s conduct to be undertaken by an
international tribunal includes a significant measure of deference towards the State making
the impugned measure. Such a tribunal cannot simply put itself in the position of the Sate
and weigh the measure anew, particularly with hindsight. In Lemire v. Ukraine,*°° the
ICSID tribunal referred to “the legitimate right of Ukraine to pass legislation and adopt
measures for the protection of what as a sovereign it perceives to be its public interest”

(emphasis here supplied). It also decided:

“As a sovereign State, Ukraine has the inherent right to regulate its affairs and adopt
laws in order to protect the common good of its people, as defined by Parliament and
Government. The prerogative extends to promulgating regulations which define the
State’s own cultural policy [...]. The ‘high measure of deference that international
law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within
their own borders’ is reinforced in cases when the purpose of the legislation affects
deeply felt cultural or linguistic traits of the community.” (emphasis omitted).

The cited passage was there taken from the NAFTA award in SD Myers v. Canada.**!
7.21 That same passage on deference was adopted by the tribunal in the Saluka award:

“No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at the time the
investment is made remain totally unchanged. In order to determine whether
frustration of the foreign investor's expectations was justified and reasonable, the
host State’s legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the public
interest must be taken into consideration as well. As the S.D. Myers tribunal has
stated, the determination of a breach of the obligation of ‘fair and equitable
treatment’ by the host State ‘must be made in the light of the high measure of
deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities
to regulate matters within their own borders.’”

7.22 The Respondent also cited passages from the decisions in Kardassopolous v. Georgia and
LIAMCO v. Libya. The former recorded the tribunal’s view that “the Respondent is entitled
to a measure of deference” in regard to the expropriation of the claimant’s rights “in the
Georgian public interest.”** The latter recorded the tribunal’s decision that “motives are
indifferent to international law, each State being free ‘to judge for itself what it considers
useful or necessary for the public good [...].’””*4 The Tribunal accepts this general
statement as forming the high water mark of a ‘jurisprudence constante” on deference. In
this case, the Tribunal prefers a lower tide. Motives are not wholly irrelevant and can be
important in determining whether the act of a State was unlawful. Whilst it is inappropriate
to second-guess a State’s decision-making processes, for example as to issues of public
interest, it is appropriate to consider whether such processes took at the relevant time any

account of such issues.

7.23 In the Tribunal’s view, even with this lower tide, the Claimants (both KOMSA and KNI)

have not proven the first part of their four-pronged test, namely that the measures at issue

were not taken in the public interest. As to the second and third prongs relating to
discrimination and due process, the Claimants also bear the legal burden of proof. The
Tribunal decides that the Claimants have failed to prove their factual allegations relating
to discrimination. As to due process, the Tribunal does not consider that it here required
advance notice of the Expropriation Decree — not under the Treaty, customary international

law or Venezuelan law.

KOMSA: As regards the fourth prong, the Expropriation Decree 7713 and subsequent
events speak largely for themselves. The Decree provided for the immediate acquisition
of all FertiNitro assets by the Respondent on 11 October 2010. If there were any ambiguity
as to its terms or effect (which the Tribunal discounts as regards KOMSA’s interest in
FertiNitro), the public statements of the Respondent’s Minister of Energy and Oil, made at
the FertiNitro Plant also on 11 October 2010, confirmed that the Respondent was
mandatorily acquiring, nationalising and seizing all of FertiNitro’s assets: the Tribunal
refers to its findings in Part V above. There was at the time no compensation paid to
KOMSA by the Respondent. Despite intimations by the Respondent to the contrary, there

has still been no compensation paid to KOMSA more than seven years later.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent indirectly expropriated
KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro on 11 October 2010. By that date, the Respondent should
have complied with the express proviso in Article 6, requiring it (inter alia) to make
“provisions [...] for effective and adequate compensation” to be paid “without delay” to
KOMSA for its expropriated interest in FertiNitro, then or later. The Respondent did not
do so. It does not dispute that no compensation has ever been paid to KOMSA, even as of
the date of this Award. As from 11 October 2010, KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro was
completely extinguished for all practical purposes: none of the rights associated with its
shareholding in FertiNitro (via Koch José) could be exercised with the Respondent

controlling FertiNitro’s management and seizing all of FertiNitro’s assets.

The Tribunal does not consider that the Respondent’s subsequent offers to negotiate
compensation with KOMSA (through Pequiven) complied with Article 6’s proviso, still
less when it is recalled that the Respondent has not tendered or paid even a small part of

what it considered to be indubitably due to KOMSA. Nor does the Tribunal consider that

141

7.27

the proviso was met by the opportunity afforded to KOMSA to engage in lengthy and
uncertain legal proceedings in the Respondent’s own courts in Venezuela, under
Venezuelan law. These legal proceedings were begun by Pequiven on 26 July 2011 and
have reached no conclusion as regards compensation payable to KOMSA.*°> The Tribunal
recalls the frank statement made by the Respondent at the first session of this arbitration:
“[...] as a State, we’re conscious that there is an expropriation and that every expropriation
requires a compensation, a fair compensation [...].”?°° For KOMSA, the issue was then
correctly seen as the amount of compensation properly due to KOMSA, but not whether or
not there was a liability by the Respondent to pay compensation to KOMSA under Article
6 of the Treaty. Even then, no compensation was tendered by the Respondent to KOMSA.

The Respondent cited a passage from the ICSID award in Venezuela Holdings, B.V. et al
(case formerly known as “Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings B.V. et al”), v.

Venezuela, where the tribunal decided:

“[...] the mere fact that an investor has not received compensation does not in itself
render an expropriation unlawful. An offer of compensation may have been made to
the investor and, in such a case, the legality of the expropriation will depend on the
terms of that offer. In order to decide whether an expropriation is lawful or not in
the absence of payment of compensation, a tribunal must consider the facts of the

case.?357

This Tribunal does not reject this approach to the wording of Article 6 of the Treaty at issue
in this arbitration. However, on the facts of this particular case, there was no such firm offer
of compensation made to KOMSA by the Respondent itself, but rather only belated, limited
and unsuccessful negotiations with different figures advanced by Pequiven subject to further

discussion and prior approval by the Respondent. These were not “provisions [...] for

effective and adequate compensation” to be paid “without delay” to KOMSA, as required by

Article 6 of the Treaty.

In these factual circumstances, under the approach taken by the Mobil tribunal, the Tribunal
concludes that the Respondent has not made any meaningful offer of compensation or
provided any meaningful procedure for compensation to KOMSA as required by Article 6

of the Treaty.

For these reasons, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent unlawfully indirectly
expropriated KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro on 11 October 2010 in violation of Article 6
of the Treaty, as evidenced by the Expropriation Decree 7713 and the Minister’s public
statements of 11 October 2010 attributable to the Respondent. Given the terms of Article
9(4) of the Treaty (set out in Part IV above), the Tribunal confirms that such an
expropriation, as found by the Tribunal, is unlawful because the Respondent failed to
comply with its obligations under Article 6 of the Treaty. It was an indirect expropriation
because, as the Tribunal accepts, there was no formal transfer of ownership of FertiNitro’s
assets until July 2011 under Venezuelan law; but it had, as an expropriatory measure, the

same effect as a direct expropriation on 11 October 2010.

KNI: The Expropriation Decree 7713 issued on 11 October 2010 made no express reference
to the Offtake Agreement or to KNI. However, on the same day, the Minister responsible
for the Decree’s execution, explained its immediate effect in public statements inconsistent
with FertiNitro’s further performance of the Offtake Agreement in accordance with its
existing terms. As explained by the Minister, the effect of the Decree extended beyond
FertiNitro’s physical assets to include the abrogation of any existing contractual restrictions
on FertiNitro’s products being delivered in Venezuela otherwise than under the complete
control of the Respondent, principally for the domestic Venezuelan market. Indeed, that
was the motive for the Respondent seizing FertiNitro. In the Minister’s own words: “With
the control of this plant that the Venezuelan state will be taking, we now have guaranteed
all of the urea that our farm workers may need, all of the urea that our producing sector
may need, to sustain this extraordinary seeding plan and to sustain national development”
(see Part V above). There was no point in the Respondent seizing FertiNitro’s assets

without the Respondent also seizing full and effective control over all its future production

143

in Venezuela. Hence, Decree 7713 and the Minister’s address are to be considered

together, as one composite act.

At the time, that was the understanding of both Pequiven and KNI’s officers. In his oral
testimony, Mr Barrientos (of Pequiven) testified that the Minister’s references on 11
October 2010 to the Respondent’s new supply of 1.5 million tonnes of fertiliser to the
Respondent referred to FertiNitro’s total production of 1.5 million tonnes.*°* Mr Gwaltney
(for KND also understood, as confirmed on 12 October 2010 by Mr Inciarte (then President
of FertiNitro and President of Pequiven), that the Respondent had taken complete control
of FertiNitro.*°° Mr Parra (for KNI) also understood from Mr Inciarte that “KNI’s offtake
would also be taken over by the government.” Mr Inciarte was not made available by

the Respondent as a witness in this arbitration.

The Respondent, however, now faced a significant problem with FertiNitro’s bondholders
and lending banks, for whom sale proceeds paid by KNI under the Offtake Agreement
operated as security. To avoid a default, with possibly wide ramifications for FertiNitro
and the Respondent at the time, the Respondent (through Pequiven) invited KNI to

continue to purchase FertiNitro’s product.

The first relevant exchange between FertiNitro and KNI was the letter dated 26 November
2010 from Mr Edgar Alonso Flores (FertiNitro’s commercial manager) to Mr Strand (for
KND), confirming “the continuing of the Offtake Agreement under the fulfil of each clause
[...]”6! It was followed by the letter dated 1 December 2010 from Mr Perdomo
(FertiNitro’s general manager) also to Mr Strand (for KNI), confirming “the continuing
and fulfilling of the Offtake Agreement.**? (Both letters are cited more fully in Part V

above).

As to this first letter, Mr Flores testified that FertiNitro had no product available for
delivery to KNI in October 2010 because the FertiNitro Plant was shut down; and that he
had been instructed to send his letter to KNI by Mr Perdomo.** As to this second letter,

Mr Perdomo was not made available by the Respondent as a witness in this arbitration.

The next relevant exchange came with a visit by Mr Garcia (for Pequiven and a member
of FertiNitro’s ad hoc board of trustees) to Messrs Gwaltney and Parra (for KNI) on 2
December 2010. Mr Gwaltney testified: “He [Mr Garcia] emphasized that the main goal
was to maintain stability at FertiNitro while Pequiven’s negotiations with the lenders to
repay the outstanding debt were underway. He said that Pequiven wanted KNI to take
product from FertiNitro until Pequiven had reached arrangements with the lenders to
prevent a default. He added that once a path forward had been agreed to with the lenders,
Pequiven would work to compensate the shareholders and would assume KNI’s obligation
for purchasing the product.”*** Mr Parra testified in similar terms: “He told us that
Pequiven wanted KNI to lift product from FertiNitro until Pequiven had reached a solution
with the lenders and bondholders. He added that once a path forward had been agreed to
with the lenders and bondholders, Pequiven would work to compensate the shareholders
and would purchase KNI’s share of the offtake.”*°> Mr Garcia was not made available by

the Respondent as a witness in this arbitration.

In response to Pequiven’s correspondence and Mr Garcia’s visit, Mr Gwaltney then wrote
KNI’s email message of 3 December 2010 to Mr Perdomo (of FertiNitro), recited in Part
V above.* It can be assumed that, on both sides, lawyers were by now actively involved
in drafting or vetting all correspondence between Pequiven and KNI. Words now mattered
for all parties; but, in the Tribunal’s view, the parties’ contemporary conduct is more

significant, viewed objectively.

Mr Flores (of FertiNitro) saw Mr Gwaltney’s email to Mr Perdomo “a few days after Mr
Perdomo received it.”*°’ He confirmed that neither he nor anyone else at FertiNitro replied
to Mr Gwaltney or voiced any objection to KNI regarding his email.*°* If FertiNitro did
not agree with KNI’s understanding of the position following the events of 11 October
2010, FertiNitro should have said so at the time before deliveries resumed to KNI in late
2010. There is no evidence before this Tribunal that FertiNitro’s omission to do so was
due to any inadvertence or mistake. In the circumstances, KNI could reasonably

understand, as it did, that FertiNitro shared KNI’s understanding of the situation.

Where their accounts differ as to these several events, the majority of the Tribunal finds
more persuasive the testimony of Mr Gwaltney and Mr Parra called by KNI to the factual

witnesses called by the Respondent.

From 3 December 2010 onwards, the majority of the Tribunal finds that KNI took offtake
from FertiNitro on the terms of Mr Gwaltney’s email message of 3 December 2010 for
about 15 months, totalling about 333,000 tonnes of ammonia and 650,000 tonnes of urea.
Those offtakes ceased with FertiNitro’s letter dated 28 February 2012, signed by Mr
Hernandez (as the president of FertiNitro’s ad hoc board of trustees).*°° This letter was
drafted with legal advice from Mr Barrientos, as he confirmed in his testimony.*”” Mr
Barrientos also testified, somewhat grudgingly, that FertiNitro would have continued
selling product to KNI, but for the Expropriation Decree and the resignation of FertiNitro’s

1

board of directors.*”!_ Mr Hernandez was not made available by the Respondent as a

witness in this arbitration (The relevant terms of this letter are also recited in Part V above).

FertiNitro’s letter dated 28 February 2012 was not expressed as a termination of the Offtake
Agreement. It announced that FertiNitro would no longer sell its product to KNI under the

Offtake Agreement “all of which is in fulfilment of what is established in the

[Expropriation Decree] which orders the compulsory acquisition of movable and
immovable property [...]”. At this time, so it appears, FertiNitro and the Respondent no
longer faced the risk of default to bondholders and banks, because FertiNitro had
apparently satisfied the debt to its lenders by December 2011, following the Stand Still
Agreement of December 2010 (not made available by the Respondent in this arbitration).
Hence, so it seems, sale proceeds from KNI were no longer required to prevent an act of
default by FertiNitro. It is not clear to the majority of the Tribunal, on the evidence
available in this arbitration, that the Offtake Agreement was terminated in February 2012,
whether by FertiNitro, Pequiven or the Respondent (it was not terminated by KNI). What
was being terminated was the ad hoc arrangement described in Mr Gwaltney’s email

message of 3 December 2010.

In the majority of the Tribunal’s view, there was a material difference between the Parties’
positions under the Offtake Agreement before the expropriation on 11 October 2010 and
their positions thereafter to 28 February 2012 under the terms of Mr Gwaltney’s email

message of 3 December 2010.

Mr Parra (of the Koch group of companies and a former director of FertiNitro) testified as

to this difference for the period from 11 October 2010:777

“Tt was not an Offtake Agreement anymore. We continued to purchase product on a
spot basis, and my trading experience in crude oil and refined products made this a
very, very clear spot type of agreement, and I'm happy to go into the details of why I
say that. The conditions under which we were buying were very different from the
conditions that existed prior to expropriation in the Offtake Agreement, sir. We were
buying on a spot basis without obligation to lift a product. The supplier did not have
any obligation whatsoever to supply the product. The fact that the pricing mechanism
was agreed between the parties to be the same was a matter of practicality in the
sense that there was a formula already existing and the parties said: well, we can
carry on with the formula. But the sales themselves were not tied, as they were before
the expropriation, they were not tied to a specific time period, they were not tied to
an obligation to buy. They were not tied to an obligation to pay if you did not take
the product, so it was a completely different character of the contract, sir.”

The change meant that, with the Respondent fully controlling FertiNitro and its production,
KNI lost any contractual security of supply from FertiNitro. KNI was thus unable to
optimise future sales of product or to optimise future freight arrangements. As Mr Parra
testified, the change required KNI to operate, effectively, on the spot market. This
diminished operation mitigated KNI’s resulting losses up to 28 February 2012; but, whilst
relevant to the assessment of compensation (addressed in Part IX below), it cannot affect
the issue of liability as at 11 October 2010. In the majority of the Tribunal’s view, KNT’s

interest in the Offtake Agreement was nullified from 11 October 2010 onwards.

Notwithstanding several intimations otherwise, including Mr Garcia’s tentative offer of
compensation on 2 December 2010 (as described above), the Respondent has not made any
meaningful offer of compensation or provided any meaningful procedure for compensation

to KNI as required by Article 6 of the Treaty.

Just as the Offtake Agreement was an integral part of the Claimants’ single investment in
the FertiNitro project (initially both made by KOMSA), so too was the object of the
Respondent’s expropriation, comprised of both KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro and KNI’s
interest in the Offtake Agreement. From 11 October 2010 onwards, FertiNitro was fully
controlled and permanently disabled by the Respondent from complying with its
obligations to KNI under the Offtake Agreement, save and insofar as the Respondent might
permit FertiNitro to sell product to KNI on terms materially different from those provided
by the Offtake Agreement; i.e. on the terms of Mr Gwaltney’s email message of 3
December 2010. Following the events of 11 October 2010, FertiNitro, its production and
sales were subject to the Respondent’s full and effective control owing to FertiNitro’s
Venezuelan nationality and location in Venezuela, with the place of performance by

FertiNitro of the Offtake Agreement also in Venezuela.

On 28 February 2012, by express reference to the Expropriation Decree, the Respondent
(through Pequiven and FertiNitro) permitted such sales to KNI no longer. FertiNitro
remained fully and effectively controlled by the Respondent, whereby FertiNitro was
precluded by the Respondent from making any further ad hoc sales to KNI from 28
February 2012, just as it had been precluded from performing the Offtake Agreement from

11 October 2010 onwards. Throughout, FertiNitro (with Pequiven) thus acted under the

148

TAT

TA8

7A9

Respondent’s “direction or control” within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Articles on

State Responsibility.

The Tribunal does not consider that the Offtake Agreement can be treated as a mere
offshore sales agreement unrelated to KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro. It is necessary to
view the Respondent’s measures of 11 October 2010 as the indirect expropriation of a

single integrated investment. As the ICSID tribunal decided in Electrabel v. Hungary:3”

“If it were possible so easily to parse an investment into several constituent parts
each forming a separate investment [...], it would render meaningless that tribunal’s
approach [in Tecmed] to indirect expropriation based on ‘radical deprivation’ and
‘deprivation of any real substance’ as being similar in effect to a direct expropriation
or nationalisation. It would also mean, absurdly, that an investor could always meet
ing its investment as finely as the particular
circumstances required, without that investment as a whole ever meeting that same
test.”

  

the test for indirect expropriation by sli

The majority of the Tribunal considers both KOMSA’s original investment and the Offtake
Agreement as a unitary package. Just as the original investment would not have taken
place without the Offtake Agreement, so too the expropriation of 11 October 2010 was not
limited to FertiNitro’s physical assets or shareholders, as expressed by the Minister’s public
statements explaining the intended effect of the Expropriation Decree. KNI’s investment

cannot be sliced off and isolated, like a piece of sausage.

Moreover, the majority of the Tribunal does not consider that this is a case where KNI’s
interest in the Offtake Agreement (by reason of its foreign applicable law and foreign
arbitral seat) could not be the subject of any claim under Article 6 of the Treaty against the
Respondent because any claim by KNI could only be a contractual claim against FertiNitro,
subject to a foreign substantive law and, in theory, with an arbitral remedy in a foreign
country. As KNI has made clear from the outset of this arbitration, its claim is advanced
against the Respondent under the Treaty and international law and not as a contractual

claim against its co-contractor, FertiNitro, under any national law. The Respondent was

Law and Liability (30 November 2012) (RLA-110) Paragraph 6.57.

never a party to the Offtake Agreement; domestic and international proceedings result from
different causes of action with different forms of relief under different applicable systems
of law; and there is here no satisfaction of any triple identity test. In this case, such a
contractual remedy (if, in practice, it existed at all) does not extinguish KNI’s remedy
against the Respondent for the indirect expropriation of its interest in the Offtake

Agreement under Article 6 of the Treaty, as pleaded by KNI.

In this regard, it is unnecessary to list here the long line of awards from Vivendi Annulment
J onwards which consistently distinguishes between a contract claim and a treaty claim in
an ICSID or other investor-State international arbitration.*”4 KNI’s claim under Article 6
is manifestly a treaty claim made under the Treaty against the Respondent and not a
contractual claim under the Offtake Agreement against FertiNitro. It is equally
unnecessary to list the legal materials establishing that international law general prohibits
the unlawful expropriation of contractual rights, both directly and indirectly, as does the
Treaty.*”> Under the Treaty, therefore, there is no cause to nullify a foreign investor’s
interest in the performance of its contract by its counter-party, where such performance has
been deliberately thwarted and rendered valueless by the host State at the place of
performance by the unlawful exercise of a power iure imperii within the State’s own

territory.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal decides (by a majority) that the Respondent unlawfully
indirectly expropriated KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement on 11 October 2010 in
violation of Article 6 of the Treaty, as evidenced by the Expropriation Decree 7713 and the
Minister’s public statements both of 11 October 2010 attributable to the Respondent. This
was confirmed by FertiNitro’s letter dated 28 February 2012 referring to its “fulfilment of

what is established in the [Expropriation Decree] which orders the compulsory acquisition

of movable and immovable property.”?° As with KOMSA, given the terms of Article 9(4)
of the Treaty, the Tribunal (by a majority) confirms that such an expropriation is unlawful

because the Respondent failed to comply with its obligations under Article 6 of the Treaty.

It goes without saying, but it is best confirmed expressly, that the Tribunal has done its best
to understand, perhaps for too long, its members’ different reasoning, both as regards the
Respondent’s liability for KNI’s claim but also (as will appear in Part IX below) the
quantum of KNI’s claim assuming such liability. Although the minority’s dissent raises
factors not in the forefront of the Parties’ respective cases, unfortunately these differences
remain between the Tribunal’s majority and minority; and, as is his right, the minority has
recorded his disagreement with the majority in a dissenting opinion attached to this Award

as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(3).7””

The Tribunal’s Decisions

KOMSA: The Tribunal decides that the Respondent is liable to KOMSA in regard to its

claim for the Respondent’s violation of Article 6 of the Treaty on 11 October 2010.

KNI: The Tribunal (by a majority) decides that the Respondent is liable to KNI for its claim
for the Respondent’s violation of Article 6 of the Treaty on 11 October 2010.

PART VIII: NON-EXPROPRIATION ISSUES

Introduction

KOMSA’s “Historical Losses” are advanced as claims against the Respondent under
Article 4(1), Article 4(2) and Article 11(2) of the Treaty. They comprise of losses allegedly
suffered by KOMSA from losses allegedly suffered by FertiNitro originally, from: (i) new
and increased taxes, (ii) non-payment (or late payment) of VAT credits, (iii) the effect of

the Urea Decree and Urea Resolution, and, (iv) interference in FertiNitro’s business.

The total compensation claimed by KOMSA for its “Historical Losses” is US$ 42 million.
For KOMSA, Mr Giles calculates the breakdown of this total amount as follows: (i) US$
4.7 million for the increased Municipal taxes and US$ 5.4 million for the new Science and
Technology tax; (ii) US$ 7.7 million for VAT; (iii) US$ 22.4 million for the Urea Decree
and Urea Resolution; and (iv) as to interference in FertiNitro’s business, no specific figure

is advanced by Mr Giles.*”*

For the Respondent, Dr Flores does not advance any specific figures for “Historic Losses”.
However, as regards VAT, Dr Flores testified that he included FertiNitro’s outstanding
VAT credits as working capital within his DCF calculations for KOMSA’s expropriated
interest in FertiNitro (without arriving at a separate, specific figure). Dr Flores also
testified that KOMSA lost nothing from the devaluation of Venezuela’s currency in regard
to VAT credits because FertiNitro used its VAT credits to pay local taxes in Venezuelan

currency.”

The Tribunal summarises below the cases respectively pleaded by KOMSA and the
Respondent, as to applicable law and fact. It then addresses in turn the merits of each claim.

There is a significant overlap as to the legal and factual bases for KOMSA’s claims.

(2) — The FET Standard - Article 4(1) of the Treaty
8.5 KOMSA’s Case: In summary, as to law, KOMSA contends that the FET standard under

Article 4(1) protects investors’ legitimate expectations relating to their investment,**°

1

citing Tecmed v. Mexico.**' It concludes that States should not frustrate an investor’s

legitimate expectations that it will not act in an arbitrary manner or inconsistently with its
legal framework, and more generally that modifications of the legal, regulatory and

business framework on which the investor relied is a breach of the FET standard, further

citing Thunderbird v. Mexico,**? Occidental vy. Ecuador,**? and National Grid v.

Argentina. 384 KOMSA also contends that, under the FET standard, the requirement of
transparency and procedural fairness includes openness in a State’s decision-making
process relating to investments, as well as the investors’ involvement in that process, **°

citing Tecmed v. Mexico and Waste Management v. Mexico.**®

predictable legal and business environment, overlapping with the requirements regarding
legitimate expectation and transparency,**’ citing CMS v. Argentina,*** LG&E v.

8.7 As to the facts, KOMSA alleges the following breaches of the FET standard in the

Treaty:*°*

8.8 Taxes: The Respondent imposed a series of new taxes and tax increases on FertiNitro
which prejudiced its profitability to the detriment of KOMSA, namely the new Science and
Technology Tax (2% of gross income, ultimately causing FertiNitro to pay US$ 22.35
million from 2006 to October 2010) and the increase in Municipal taxes (from 1 to 4%,

ultimately causing FertiNitro to pay US$ 18.82 million also from 2006 to October 2010).°°>

8.9 VAT: The Respondent repeatedly failed, either promptly or at all, to provide FertiNitro with
VAT credits from 2005, ultimately causing FertiNitro to be owed US$ 28.3 million of VAT

credits by the Respondent.*?°

8.10 Urea Decree and Urea Resolution: These new urea regulations impacted FertiNitro from
2007. The Respondent had given assurances to a third party (METOR) that these new
regulations would not apply to existing enterprises, such as FertiNitro. Such compulsion
interfered with pricing for FertiNitro’s products and, also, the allocation of export markets

between FertiNitro and Pequiven under the Offtake Agreement.*””

8.11 Interference: The Respondent progressively interfered with the management, operations
and profitability of FertiNitro, whereas KOMSA had received assurances that Pequiven
would only act as a “commercial partner”. As an example, the Claimants refer to the
Comisario Report of 7 September 2006,*** as evidence of the Respondent’s improper

interference in FertiNitro’s business. The Respondent ultimately expropriated KOMSA’s

interest in FertiNitro unlawfully in October 2010.*”” (The Tribunal has already addressed
this claim for expropriation under Article 6 of the Treaty, in Part VII above, and it is

therefore unnecessary to do so again here.)

The Respondent’s Case: In summary, as to law, the Respondent contends that KOMSA
relies upon an overbroad definition of the FET standard, ignoring both the text of the Treaty
and international law.” The Respondent emphasises the wording “in accordance with the
tules and principles of international law” in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. It also cites the
decisions*”! in Lauder v. Czech Republic,*” Glamis Gold v. USA*® and El Paso v.
Argentina.*** Jt submits that the similarly worded FET standards in these cases were
correctly interpreted as the minimum standard under international customary law. The
Respondent also relies on the decision in Flughafen v. Venezuela (where the same Treaty
was analysed), submitting that the tribunal there interpreted Article 4(1) of the Treaty as

the minimum standard under customary international law.”

The Respondent challenges KOMSA’s reliance on Tecmed’s broad formulation of the FET
standard. It asserts that the Tecmed award has been widely criticised and also runs counter
to the express wording in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. It rejects also other decisions cited by
KOMSA as inapposite because the FET standards in those cases did not refer expressly to
customary international law, as here. The Respondent concludes that, even adopting a
broad interpretation of the FET standard, KOMSA does not articulate the evidential sources

for its expectations or how those expectations were in fact legitimate.*°°

Generally, as with all KOMSA’s “Historical Losses”, the Respondent contends that

KOMSA’s alleged losses are not recoverable under the Treaty, unless KOMSA proves that

the Respondent’s allegedly wrongful actions impacted KOMSA’s own financial position
(as “flow-through damage”), and not only impacted FertiNitro (which, as to both, the
Respondent denies). The Respondent contends that KOMSA has failed to prove that it
suffered any losses of its own, such as lost dividends as a minority indirect shareholder in

FertiNitro.
The Respondent denies the factual allegations advanced by KOMSA, as follows:

Taxes: The Respondent contends that the new and increased tax measures do not breach
the FET standard because KOMSA could not have had any legitimate expectations that tax
rates would remain unchanged in the absence of specific representations or commitments
from the Respondent. There were no such representations or assurances; nor any
stabilisation agreement concluded between KOMSA (or FertiNitro) and the Respondent.*””
In addition, the Respondent submits that the increase of such taxes was neither egregious
nor shocking. The Respondent refers to the decisions in Paushok v. Mongolia,*°’ EnCana

v. Ecuador,*°? EDF v. Romania*'® and El Paso v. Argentina.*"!

The Respondent further contends that the tax measures were transparent and not
procedurally unfair, with KOMSA failing to point to any evidence that would prove
otherwise. In addition, the Respondent contends that the FET standard under customary

international law imposes no such requirement as to transparency.*!?

VAT: The Respondent contends that its treatment of FertiNitro’s VAT credits did not
breach the FET standard because: (a) VAT credits were issued for each application filed
by FertiNitro, albeit subject to delays which are common in Venezuela; (b) credit refund
processing was transparent and procedurally fair, in compliance with Venezuelan law; (c)

the Respondent’s delays in the treatment of VAT credits did not create an inconsistent,

unstable or unpredictable legal framework, because such delays applied generally to any
applicant in Venezuela, including FertiNitro. Further, so the Respondent alleges,
FertiNitro had legal remedies to challenge delays before the Venezuelan courts, which
FertiNitro chose not to do.*!?_ The Respondent also rejects KOMSA’s assertion that the
VAT credits could be refunded directly to KOMSA, as a minority shareholder of FertiNitro
(the VAT taxpayer).*!4

The Respondent also submits that KOMSA is incorrect that part of the outstanding
recoverable VAT was ‘written off’ by the Respondent during 2006-2010. Rather, so the
Respondent alleges, FertiNitro simply took accounting provisions (or allowances) in its
balance sheet following reporting standards. The Respondent contends that the financial
documentation shows that the credits were indeed recovered, so that ultimately no damage
was suffered by FertiNitro. The Respondent submits that Mr Giles’ approach, in contrast,

is flawed since it results in double, triple, and quadruple counting.

Urea Decree and Urea Resolution: The new urea regulations did not frustrate any of
KOMSA’s legitimate expectations because they were not entitled to any regulatory
stabilisation in the absence of any specific contractual commitment by the Respondent to
KOMSA. The regulations were in any case issued to further a legitimate policy of the
Respondent relating to food safety; and they could be challenged before the Venezuelan

courts if FertiNitro (with KOMSA) so wished; but they were not so challenged.*!>

Interference: The Respondent contends that Pequiven’s participation in the management
and operations of FertiNitro did not violate the FET standard because Pequiven was run as
a commercial, not political, entity; Pequiven was a shareholder in FertiNitro; it was a party
to the Offtake Agreement; and FertiNitro was not controlled by Pequiven. In addition,

KOMSA had legal remedies, under Venezuelan corporate law, to challenge certain

measures such as the appointment of new directors by Pequiven, which it chose not to

pursue.

The Respondent submits that the Comisario report (alleged by KOMSA to stand as
evidence of the Respondent’s interference in FertiNitro’s business) is irrelevant to that
issue. This Comisario was appointed as FertiNitro’s statutory auditor by the entire board
of FertiNitro and thus, as the Respondent contends, with KOMSA’s support. Likewise,
Pequiven’s proposal to acquire more fertilizer (allegedly under the Respondent’s
instructions) followed a normal procedure under Venezuelan corporate law; and it was
rejected by FertiNitro. Moreover, the alleged assurances given to a third party (METOR)
that the new laws would not apply to foreign companies are irrelevant. They are not
attributable to the Respondent. They are also derived from a letter sent a decade after the
event and hinge upon an erroneous interpretation of that letter. Finally, so the Respondent
submits, Pequiven only participated in the drafting of the urea regulations in an advisory
capacity based on its experience in fertilizers, without thereby unlawfully interfering in

FertiNitro’s business.*!¢

The FPS Standard - Article 4(1)

KOMSA’s Case: In summary, KOMSA contends that the FPS standard protects
investments from both physical and non-physical interference by the Respondent,*!” citing
the decisions in ELSI*'® and Azurix v. Argentina.*? The FPS standard, so KOMSA
contends, obliges the Respondent, as the host State, to ensure that it provides a secure and

stable legal and regulatory environment to the investor, namely KOMSA.*?°

KOMSA contends that (i) the failure to pay VAT credit, (ii) the regulations forcing the sale

of urea by FertiNitro to Pequiven, and (iii) the progressive interference with the

management and operation of FertiNitro ultimately leading to the expropriation of

contractual rights, each constitute a breach of the FPS standard by the Respondent.*”!

The Respondent’s Case: In summary, the Respondent contends, as with the FET standard,
that the FPS standard in Article 4 of the Treaty refers to the minimum standard under
customary international law.*??. The Respondent interprets that standard as referring to

423 the decision in Saluka v. Czech Republic,”4 Lauder v. Czech

physical security, citing
Republic, #25 Noble Ventures v. Romania,*?® and Paushok v. Mongolia.” Tt submits that
this standard only imposes “a level of diligence in attempting to ensure that foreign
investments are not harmed during periods of strife or violence”. The Respondent also

#29 where the tribunal

invokes**® Gold Reserve v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,
interpreted an identical clause in the Canada-Venezuela BIT and found that the FPS
standard was limited to physical harm to persons and property.**’ The Respondent thus
dismisses KOMSA’s argument that the standard extends to legal protection. It submits

that, if it did, that would wrongly conflate the FPS standard with the FET standard.

The Respondent then turns to the alleged breaches of the FPS standard. It submits that the
treatment of VAT credits could not breach the FPS standard because the refund
applications were ultimately approved; and that any processing delays (that applied to all
taxpayers in Venezuela) could not amount to a breach of the FPS standard. The enactment
of the Urea Decree and Urea Resolutions did not breach the FPS standard because they
were reasonably created under the Respondent’s food and security policies and could be

challenged in Venezuela’s courts, if KOMSA had so wished (which it did not do). The

“Arbitrary and Discriminatory Measures” - Article 4(1)

KOMSA’s Case: In summary, KOMSA contends that the standard for arbitrary and
discriminatory measures under Article 4(1) of the Treaty imposes a requirement on the
Respondent not to treat investors in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner, including
“inconsistent and confusing” measures.**? Such measures can constitute a breach of Article

4(1) if they are arbitrary or (not “and”) discriminatory.**

KOMSA contends that: (i) the imposition of the tax measures on FertiNitro had a
discriminatory impact on KOMSA because the new and increased taxes targeted entities
that were majority foreign-owned or were large companies (conversely, these tax measures
exempted public sector entities such as Pequiven or applied lower rates to other
companies); (ii) the Urea Decree and Urea Resolution compelled FertiNitro to sell urea to
Pequiven at prices below market value (these measures were discriminatory measures
because KNI did not benefit from preferential prices, nor did KOMSA (or KNID) participate
in the drafting of these Urea regulations, unlike Pequiven); and (iii) the Expropriation
Decree No. 7713 was discriminatory because it furthered Pequiven’s interest to KOMSA’s

detriment.*4

The Respondent’s Case: In summary, the Respondent contends that the test for arbitrary
conduct consists in determining whether the measures were a wilful disregard of due
process of law that shocks or surprises a sense of juridical propriety. It extends also to
whether the measures can be defended as reasonable, i.e. where the State’s actions can be
linked to a reasonable policy. The test for discrimination consists in whether the State

treated differently, without justification, entities otherwise similarly placed. The

Respondent rejects KOMSA’s test of inconsistent or confusing measures in the absence of

malign prejudice or preference.**>

The Respondent submits that the tax measures were neither arbitrary nor discriminatory as
they applied to all similarly situated entities, both domestic and foreign. One of the taxes
was a contribution intended to be re-invested in FertiNitro for research and development
purposes, thus benefiting FertiNitro and not harming KOMSA at all.**° Further, the urea
regulations could not be discriminatory because KOMSA and Pequiven were not similarly
situated. They operated in distinct markets and were not competitors, even if they were
involved in the same sector of the Venezuelan economy. In any event, the measures were

passed pursuant to the Respondent’s food policy and were not discriminatory.**”

National Treatment — Article 4(2)

KOMSA’s Case: In summary, KOMSA contends that the National Treatment standard in
Article 4(2) of the Treaty entitles investors to treatment no less favourable than that
accorded by the State to its own nationals. It submits that this question turns on the
particular facts of the case, making it necessary to take into account all circumstances.**
KOMSA contends that by seeking to add the wording “in like circumstances” that is not
found in Article 4(2), the Respondent wrongly makes that standard less protective of the

investor.‘

KOMSA submits that the Respondent’s discriminatory measures constitute breaches of the
National Treatment standard. KOMSA contends that: (i) the tax measures favoured
Pequiven, a national entity, because it was exempt, and the urea regulations, drafted to
appear facially neutral, targeted foreign companies and, in turn, KOMSA,; (ii) the urea
regulations granted Pequiven advantageous purchasing terms as it could buy urea below

market price, an option that was not available to KNI; and (iii) the expropriation of October

2010 transferred assets and rights to Pequiven, a national entity thus enjoying benefits to

the detriment of KOMSA.*°

The Respondent’s Case: In summary, the Respondent determines that the standard is
necessarily one of comparison between the treatment afforded to foreigners and the
treatment afforded to nationals in similar positions, considering the entirety of the
circumstances. The Respondent objects to KOMSA’s test according to which it would not
be necessary to find a national comparator similarly situated. The Respondent contends
that the test of “in like circumstances” always applies under international law, whether or
not language to that effect is found in the BIT. It adds that States can always resort to

sovereign discretionary rights to implement certain policies.**!

The Respondent contends that no Venezuelan national benefited from a more favourable
treatment because Pequiven, although exempt itself as to certain taxes, was impacted no
less than KOMSA, as a direct shareholder in FertiNitro (the actual tax payer). As for the
urea regulations, they were rational in furthering the Respondent’s food policy. Finally,
the Expropriation Decree No. 7713 did not favour Pequiven because Pequiven did not

ultimately hold any of the assets acquired thereunder. +4

(7) — The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decisions

8.37 As summarised above, KOMSA’s non-expropriatory claims for “Historical Losses” under
Articles 4 and 11 and the Treaty derive from new and increased taxes, non-payment (or
late payment) of VAT credits, the effects of the Urea Decree and Urea Resolution and
interference with FertiNitro’s business. Although advanced under five distinct provisions

of the Treaty, each claim is subject to certain common factual factors.

8.38 Articles 1(1) and (2): The alleged harm was suffered by FertiNitro directly and only
consequentially by KOMSA, as an indirect minority shareholder in FertiNitro. In this
arbitration, KOMSA is asserting its own claim for its own losses and not as any derivative
claim for losses suffered by FertiNitro only. If it were otherwise, KOMSA’s claim would
face obvious jurisdictional difficulties under Articles 1(1) and 1(2) of the Treaty and Article
25 of the ICSID Convention. KOMSA is legally distinct from FertiNitro (and also Koch
José). FertiNitro is a juridical person of Venezuelan nationality; and it is not a covered

investor with protected investments under the Treaty.*4°

8.39 Accordingly, KOMSA can only claim compensation for loss actually suffered by it arising
from its own indirect minority investment in FertiNitro. In principle, a minority
shareholder, even with shares held indirectly by an associated company, can claim
compensation for proven indirect loss. As was decided in Rosinvest v. Russia: “modern
investment treaty arbitration does not require that a shareholder can only claim protection
in respect of measures that directly affect shares in their own right, but that the investor
can also claim protection for the effect on its shares by measures of the host state taken
against the company.”“7 However, the investor must still prove actual crystallised loss

from the indirect effect on its equity interest, as distinct from loss by the company.

jurisdictional grounds). For a more guarded approach, see GAMI Investments, Inc. v. United Mexican States,
UNCITRAL, Award (15 November 2004) (RLA-64). One member of the Tribunal does not accept that the broad
statement on the admissibility of shareholder claims in RosInvestCo is correct, however, given the Tribunal’s
ultimate conclusion on these claims, the member sees no utility in expanding upon the point of disagreement in
this Award.

8.43

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no cogent evidence that KOMSA, as regards its own indirect
interest as a minority shareholder in FertiNitro, suffered a loss sufficiently quantifiable in
money terms from any of its “Historical Claims”. There was no sufficient evidence of any
simple “pass through” of loss suffered by FertiNitro, so as to become a pro-rated loss to
KOMSA as a partial indirect shareholder of FertiNitro. KOMSA also adduced insufficient
proof of its own actual direct losses, as distinct from losses sustained by FertiNitro. The

position could be different if FertiNitro was wholly owned by KOMSA,; but it never was.

This approach would suffice for the Tribunal to dismiss KOMSA’s claims “for Historical
Losses” in limine. However, the Tribunal considers that this approach could unfairly
impose too high an evidential hurdle for KOMSA in this case; and, given the efforts made
by the Parties and their expert witnesses on quantum, it would be discourteous to stop the
analysis here. Hence, for present purposes, it is prepared to assume that some part of
FertiNitro’s alleged losses did “pass through” to KOMSA as regards taxes, VAT, the Urea
Decree and the Urea Resolution. However, given the absence of any separate quantifiable
figure for interference in FertiNitro’s business, no assumption as to loss is there made by
the Tribunal. Further, if and to the extent that KOMSA is advancing a claim for loss to
KNI (unquantified) resulting from “Historical Losses”, separately from KNI’s claim for

expropriation, the Tribunal dismisses that claim also as lacking any evidential justification.

Article 4(1): The FET and FPS standards accorded to covered investments in Article 4(1)
of the Treaty are prefaced by the words: “[i]n accordance with the rules and principles of
international law”. In the Tribunal’s view, as explained below, these words import the
customary international law minimum standards, rather than any autonomous higher
standards, applying the rule of interpretation codified in Article 31(1) of the VCLT as to

“the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms in their context.”

The Tribunal need not here debate the jurisprudence or doctrinal writings, so neatly
captured by Dr Mann long ago. As is well known, in his 1982 publication, Dr Mann
concluded that a FET standard: “[...] in essence, is a duty imposed by customary

international law [...] which in law is unlikely to amount to more than a confirmation of

164

8.44

8.45

the obligation to act in good faith, or to refrain from abuse or arbitrariness.”** It was

perhaps a more considered conclusion than his earlier opinion to the contrary:

“The terms ‘fair and equitable treatment’ envisage conduct which goes far beyond
the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater extent and according to a
much more objective standard than any previously employed form of words. A
tribunal should not be concerned with a minimum, maximum, or average standard.
It will have to decide whether in all the circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and
equitable or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by other words is likely to

be material. The terms are to be understood and applied independently and

autonomously.”**°

This debate has continued in later arbitral decisions, as cited in the Parties’ submissions to

different effect; but that debate is not relevant here.

The FET and FPS standards in this Treaty are prefaced with the express qualification: “in
accordance the rules and principles of international law.” In the Tribunal’s view, this
additional express wording is conclusive in confirming the meaning of the FET and FPS
standards as the duties imposed by customary international law and in precluding an
independent or autonomous meaning. In AAPL v. Sri Lanka, it was the “non-reference to
international law” which led that tribunal to adopt an autonomous FPS standard; and (with
the dissent), it is clear the tribunal would have decided otherwise with the express

additional wording in this Treaty.*°°

The Tribunal also adopts the reasoning of the decision in Flughafen v. Venezuela, cited by

451 That case also

the Respondent, on the same wording of Article 4(1) of the Treaty.
concerned (inter alia) the same Switzerland-Venezuela BIT, where the express additional
qualification was translated into English as: “in accordance with the norms and criteria of

international law”. The tribunal there decided:

“If the BITs must be interpreted in accordance with Customary International Law,
and if the minimum treatment is part of that set of uses and customs, then one has to
reach the inevitable conclusion that an interpreter, when determining whether or not
a particular action violates Article 4 of the BITs, must take into consideration the
manner in which Customary International Law defines FET. Therefore, the Tribunal
considers that the provision included in the BITs, requiring that FET be defined in
accordance with International Law necessarily incorporates a reference to the level
of protection that International Law provides to foreigners, that is, to what is known
as the customary minimum standard.”

8.46 The Tribunal’s interpretation suffices to dismiss KOMSA’s claim under the FPS standard
on the facts alleged by KOMSA. Under its meaning well-settled in customary international
law, the FPS standard is confined to physical protection to aliens against acts of third
persons not attributable to the host State.**? As such, it can give rise to a limited form of
liability in factual circumstances where the host State has failed to exercise reasonable

diligence to prevent such acts. That is manifestly not this case.

8.47 As regards the FET standard under customary international law, the factual evidence
remains relevant, to be addressed below. However, as to such evidence, the Tribunal does
not consider that the result in this case would be materially different under an FET’s
autonomous standard. There was no cogent evidence of KOMSA’s legitimate expectations
induced by any specific undertaking or representation made to KOMSA by the Respondent
to induce KOMSA’s investment. It is well settled that provisions of general legislation or
state policies applicable to a plurality of persons do not suffice generally to establish

legitimate expectations required under an FET autonomous standard.

8.48 As to the third limb of Article 4(1) of the Treaty, namely the protection against “arbitrary
or discriminatory measures”, the issue arises whether it means what it says tout court; or
whether, because the use of a semi-colon (as opposed to a full stop or a separate sub-
clause), this further limb should also be read subject to the express additional wording. In
the Tribunal’s view, this third limb must be read separately, without reference to a

customary international law minimum standard (if any exists). However, its meaning is

clearly directed at “the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, expansion,
disposal or liquidation” of KOMSA’s “investment”, namely KOMSA’s indirect minority
equity interest in FertiNitro, as distinct from FertiNitro itself. KOMSA is not here
advancing a claim for any direct interference with its own equity interest in FertiNitro, as
such. In the Tribunal’s view, KOMSA’s claim under this limb of Article 4(1) is better (or
not worse) advanced under the FET standard, as to which its claim succeeds or fails on the

relevant evidence. Accordingly, the Tribunal proceeds on that basis below.

Article 4(2): The Tribunal does not consider that Pequiven as a local state-owned and state-
controlled company, is an appropriate ‘comparator’ to KOMSA under Article 4(2) of the
Treaty. It is true that both were shareholders in FertiNitro and that both were engaged,
directly or indirectly, in the fertiliser business in Venezuela; but the similarities stop there.
Pequiven was a direct and active participant in that local business, whereas KOMSA was
an indirect foreign investor. KOMSA cannot here be assimilated to FertiNitro.
Accordingly, in the absence of any appropriate comparator, the Tribunal dismisses

KOMSA’s claims regarding “National Treatment” under Article 4(2) of the Treaty.

Article 11(2): KOMSA does not assert any “stabilisation” clause as regards its investment
in FertiNitro; and, as Mr Parra (of KOMSA) testified, KOMSA received from the
Respondent no “specific assurance, written document, letter, other than what existed in the
law at the time.”*°* The Tribunal has indeed not seen any cogent evidence of any material
representation, assurance or undertaking made by the Respondent to KOMSA in regard to
its interest in FertiNitro, whether explicit or even necessarily implicit, in any contemporary
document or agreement. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses KOMSA’s claim under

Article 11(2), the “Umbrella Clause”, of the Treaty.

The FET Standard: The Tribunal begins with certain general observations. First, from the
outset, the FertiNitro project was known by all participants, including KOMSA, to be

subject to significant political, economic and other uncertainties in Venezuela. As recorded

453 First (September) Hearing, D2.81-82 (Parra).

167

8.52

8.53

8.54

in the 1998 Bond Offering Memorandum for the FertiNitro project,**4 these uncertainties
included “changes in taxation policies”, whereby FertiNitro’s results “are expected to be
affected generally by [...] changes in Venezuelan governmental leadership, policy and
taxation [...]”. It was also known that the next Presidential elections in Venezuela would
take place later in December 1998. In those elections, Mr Chavez was elected President of

Venezuela and subsequently re-elected until his death in 2013.

Second, the protections accorded to investors and their investments under the Treaty do
not operate as an insurance against normal business risks, changes in domestic laws or
regulatory action by the host State. As was decided in Saluka v. Czech Republic (already
cited in Part VI above): “[i]t is now established in international law that States are not liable
to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory
powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide regulations that are aimed at
the general welfare.”*°> Such regulatory powers extend to taxation. As was decided in
EnCana; “[i]n the absence of a specific commitment from the host State, the foreign
investor has neither the right nor any legitimate expectation that the tax regime will not
change, perhaps to its disadvantage, during the period of the investment.”*°° As the Bond
Offering Memorandum expressly stated (cited above), this is no more than business

common sense, as would have been well understood by KOMSA at the time.

The question therefore is not whether the Respondent has exercised its regulatory or other
powers causing loss to KOMSA, but whether in so doing, the Respondent has violated its
obligations to KOMSA under the Treaty. As to that question, as already explained above,
the Respondent’s measures are to be weighed, with due deference, on the factual evidence

adduced in this arbitration.

Third, FertiNitro was, long before the events of October 2010, a troubled and unhappy

company (or, rather, “companies”). The Tribunal refers to the Comisario Report of 7

484 Offering Circular - Bond Offering of $250,000,000 between FertiNitro Finance Inc and FertiNitro (8 April 1998)
(C-115), page 50.

September 2006, made by FertiNitro‘s statutory auditor reporting to all its shareholders. It
identified (as translated into English) “conflicts of interest between the Directors making
swift-decision-making difficult”; “excessive disputes, particularly the problems

concerning the Plants and the Offtake Agreement

uncertainty regarding the safety and
operational continuity of the Plants”; “the union claims for work benefits which [...] have
not been solved”; an “absence of handbooks, approved by the Management Board, on the
policies, norms and procedures for technical, operative, administrative and accounting
functions and duties”; and the necessity for “revising the Company’s organization structure
in accordance with existing needs [...]”.*°” After 2006 and by 2010, FertiNitro’s condition
worsened significantly. In these circumstances, confirmed by other contemporary
evidence, FertiNitro’s business difficulties cannot be lightly attributed to effects for which

the Respondent might be legally responsible under the Treaty or international law.

Taxes: Ostensibly at least, the impugned taxes were of general application. As to Municipal
taxes, the classifier for Group 1-D identified:** “{a]ll industrial economic activities
exercised by [...] legal [...] entities of the Energy, Natural Gas Production Sector and all
activities related to the oil and gas and petrochemical industry, which is linked to the
activity that is directly or indirectly related to the Jose Petrochemical Complex [...].” As
to the Science and Technology tax, Article 37 of the Law targeted generally “[t]he large
companies in the country dealing with other sectors of production of goods and provision

of services [...].”*°? Moreover, this Law conferred direct benefits on FertiNitro.

The Tribunal does not consider that KOMSA, on the factual evidence, has established a
violation of the FET standard by the Respondent (or Article 4(1)’s third limb). In
particular, these were not tax measures proven to have been made in bad faith, arbitrarily,
irrationally or with an improper intent to discriminate directly against FertiNitro (or
indirectly against KOMSA). Given later events in October 2010, it could be tempting to

use hindsight in evaluating these tax measures; but the Tribunal thinks it inappropriate to

do so. These measures must be assessed at the time of their enactment, when different

circumstances existed.

VAT: As to VAT, the Respondent maintains that all the VAT credits requested by
FertiNitro have been paid, as shown by its VAT tables from 2001 to 2010.* At the Third
(June) Hearing, the Respondent acknowledged that VAT credits were paid late, as is also

evidenced by its own VAT tables.

There is no cogent evidence of any specific monetary loss suffered by FertiNitro from the
Respondent’s delays, still less of any resulting specific monetary loss to KOMSA. Mr
Giles, albeit not a factual witness, testified that for each year from 2006 to 2010, “part of
the outstanding recoverable VAT was written off” by the Respondent. Dr Flores testified
that this was incorrect; and that FertiNitro’s accounting provisions had no “real cash flow

effects” as Mr Giles suggested.**! Dr Flores was likewise not a factual witness.

The Tribunal regrets the paucity of cogent evidence on this issue. It is clear that the
Respondent issued VAT credits late to FertiNitro; but that was the usual practice in
Venezuela suffered by all VAT taxpayers entitled to tax credits. The evidence was all one
way as regards such regular delays. In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider
that KOMSA, on the factual evidence, has established a violation of the FET standard by
the Respondent (or Article 4(1)’s third limb). In particular, these delays were not proven
to have been made in bad faith, arbitrarily, irrationally or with an improper intent to

discriminate directly against FertiNitro (or indirectly against KOMSA).

Urea Decree and Urea Resolution: The Urea Decree and Urea Resolution were issued in
March and May 2007 respectively.*°? The Respondent submits that the Urea Decree and

the Urea Resolution were issued by the Respondent as part of its regulatory role in ensuring

460 FertiNitro, VAT Credits 2001-2010 (updated to December 2010) (R-73).

food supply and security for the people of Venezuela.* At the time, KOMSA did not
actively oppose the Urea Decree or Urea Resolution by litigation or like administrative
action within Venezuela’s legal system; nor did FertiNitro itself.4°

As already found in Part VII above, the Tribunal, in the exercise of the deference due to
the Respondent, considers these urea regulations to have been made in pursuit of the
Respondent’s policies on food security and supply for the people of Venezuela. Ostensibly,
albeit causing direct loss to FertiNitro, the Tribunal does not consider that KOMSA, on the
factual evidence, has established a violation of the FET standard by the Respondent (or
Article 4(1)’s third limb). In particular, these urea regulations were not proven to have
been made in bad faith, arbitrarily, irrationally or with an improper intent to discriminate
directly against FertiNitro (or indirectly against KOMSA). Similarly, given the later events
in October 2010, although it could be tempting to use hindsight in evaluating these urea
regulations (as KOMSA suggests), the Tribunal again thinks it inappropriate to do so.

These urea regulations must also be assessed at the time of their enactment.

Decisions: For these reasons, as to liability, the Tribunal decides to dismiss KOMSA’s
claims against the Respondent for “Historical Losses” under Articles 4(1), 4(2) and 11(2)

of the Treaty.

PART IX: COMPENSATION ISSUES

Introduction

In the light of the Tribunal’s decisions on jurisdiction and liability above, it is now
necessary to consider the appropriate quantum of compensation payable by the Respondent
to each of the Claimants, namely KOMSA for its expropriated interest in FertiNitro and
KNI for its expropriated interest in the Offtake Agreement. The Tribunal begins with an
outline of its general approach to compensation, turning then to a summary of the Parties’
attempts to negotiate compensation due by the Respondent to KOMSA, which has already
been addressed in greater detail in the chronology set out in Part V above. It is appropriate
next to summarise the Claimants’ quantum submissions and the Respondent’s submissions
in response, before turning to the Tribunal’s consideration of those competing submissions

and its decisions as to the appropriate amounts of compensation.

Given the evolutionary development of the Parties’ respective cases on compensation
during this arbitration, the very significant differences between the testimony of their
respective expert witnesses (Mr Giles and Dr Flores) and the complexities of the issues
relating to compensation (for both KOMSA and KNI), the Tribunal has found it necessary
to summarise at some length the Parties’ successive submissions on compensation. That
summary may also provide a useful reference as to what was and what was not submitted
by the Parties on such issues in this arbitration to be read with the lists of issues in Part IIT
above. Inevitably, however, parts of this summary are duplicative and (given the evolution

of the Parties’ cases) not fully consistent.

As to its general approach, the Tribunal bears much in mind, as contended by the
Respondent, that the Claimants generally bear the legal burden of proving their respective
cases on compensation. This general principle is well established under international law:

onus probandi actori incumbit.

The Tribunal also bears in mind that complex issues of compensation, dividing the
disputing parties and their expert witnesses, can require a margin of appreciation by an

arbitral tribunal applying the wording of a BIT and international law. The required exercise

172

can be therefore less than an exact science. The Tribunal refers to the approach taken by
international arbitration tribunals, such as the awards in Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic* and

ADC v. Hungary.*°
9.5 As was decided in Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic:

“154. The Tribunal is conscious of the desirability for conceptual clarity in valuing
assets for the purposes of calculating compensation payable; and it is conscious of
the criticism of ‘triangulation’ methods, which select a figure that lies somewhere in
the middle ground of estimates put forward by the parties.

155. The Tribunal is also aware of the fact that all valuations in the absence of an
actual sale are estimates, and is mindful of the fact that the Tribunal has a legal duty
to render an award under a process which the Respondent has freely agreed to
establish and the Claimant has freely chosen to pursue, and to do so on the basis of
the material that the parties have decided to put before it. That is, necessarily, an
exercise in the art of the possible; and the Tribunal has sought to arrive at a rational
and fair estimate, in accordance with the BIT, of the loss sustained by the Claimant
rather than to engage in a search for the chimera of a sum that is a uniquely and
indisputably correct determination of the value of what the Claimant lost. The
Tribunal derives some comfort from Immanuel Kant's observation that ‘Out of the
crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever made.’”

9.6 In ADC v. Hungary, the tribunal likewise decided that:

“[T]he assessment of damages is not a science. True it is that the experts use a variety
of methodologies and tools in order to attempt to arrive at the correct figure. But at
the end of the day, the Tribunal can stand back and look at the work product and
arrive at a figure with which it is comfortable in all the circumstances of the case.”

9.7 Under international law, there is thus by now a well-established ‘jurisprudence constante’

to the effect that, however difficult, an international tribunal must do its best to quantify a

loss, provided that it is satisfied that some loss has been caused to the claimant by the

156), Paragraph 832.

wrongdoing of the respondent.‘”’ In the Tribunal’s view, there is no doubt that the
Claimants have both suffered some loss caused by the Respondent’s violations of Article

6 of the Treaty.

The difficulties in this case arise from the quantification of the monetary damages required
from the Respondent to compensate each of the two Claimants. As already indicated,
international tribunals have traditionally resolved such difficulties applying a rule of
reason, rather than a rule requiring certainty in calculating compensation based upon
precisely calculated figures. Almost invariably, this approach now requires tribunals to
reject the full extent of the parties’ primary cases on quantum and the often wildly differing
results of their respective expert witnesses’ methodologies, assumptions and instructions.
For tactical reasons, a claimant may not wish to discount downwards the full amount of its
pleaded claim; and a respondent denying loss similarly may not wish to offer a
methodology resulting in any significant damages being awarded in a claimant’s favour.
A tribunal must then work by itself in the rational no man’s land left vacant by the parties
and their expert witnesses, as best it can. In the present case, the Tribunal has faced grave
difficulties in understanding how the Parties and their respective expert witnesses on

quantum can have presented such very different figures.

The Negotiations for Compensation

In brief, as described in Part V above, negotiations were held between Pequiven for the
Respondent (as the expropriating body designated under the Expropriation Decree) and
FertiNitro’s foreign shareholders, including KOMSA, between February and September
2011. These negotiations did not include KNI, which had been led to expect separate but
not dissimilar treatment. At the time, these negotiations with FertiNitro’s shareholders
were described by Pequiven (for the Respondent) as encompassing amicable settlement
talks for compensation “contemplated by both the applicable Venezuelan law, as well as

the Bilateral Investment Protection Treaties”.“%

47 See, for example, Sistem v. Kyrgyz, Paragraphs 154 and 155.

All four meetings were attended by Mr Barrientos (for Pequiven). Mr Barrientos testified
at the First (September) Hearing that he was privy to Pequiven’s decision to engage
Advantis, as consultants to advise on the amount of compensation payable to FertiNitro’s
foreign shareholders.* Mr Barrientos was unable to explain to the Tribunal the difference
between Advantis’ valuation of KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro of about US$ 113 million
(which he considered to be at the time a fair valuation and a “genuine estimate of what the
company was worth’) and Dr Flores’ valuation (as the Respondent’s expert witness in this
arbitration) of US$ 34.6 million.” However, as Mr Barrientos confirmed, the person
working with Advantis was Mr Garcia (who was not called as a witness by the Respondent

in this arbitration).47!

The Tribunal returns to the two Advantis Reports of May and July 2011 below.

The Claimants’ Quantum Submissions

In summary, the Claimants’ case on quantum is comprised of ten main submissions, each

addressed separately in the sub-sections below. These are:

(a) First, the Claimants have demonstrated that the Respondent must pay full
compensation under international law;

(b) Second, testimony from the Second (November) Hearing demonstrated that the
Parties’ quantum experts have adopted fundamentally different approaches to the
valuation exercise;

(c) Third, the Parties’ quantum experts agree on a number of compensation parameters,
but the differences of fact and expertise on quantum issues remain significant;

(d) Fourth, the central points of agreement and disagreement in relation to future cash
flows at FertiNitro have been identified;

(ec) _ Fifth, the central points of agreement and disagreement in relation to the valuation
of the Offtake Agreement have been identified;

(f) — Sixth, the central points of agreement and disagreement in relation to the discount
rate and the country risk premium have been identified;

47! First (September) Hearing D3.85-86.

175

(g) Seventh, the award in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela*” supports the FertiNitro-specific

country risk premium adopted by the Claimants’ quantum expert, Mr Giles; and it
discredits the generic country risk premium adopted by the Respondent’s quantum
expert, Dr Flores. By contrast, the two awards in the ExxonMobil and Mobil
cases’? do not identify any country risk premium for Venezuela and are clearly
distinguishable;

(h) Eighth, the adjusted MOU price of US$ 360 million for KOMSA’s equity share as
at 30 September 2010 (as submitted by Mr Giles in his first report and based on the
Pequiven draft MOU of October 2008)*”* is an effective reality check on the Parties’
valuations for KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro; it demonstrates that Mr Giles’
equity valuation is conservative and that, by contrast, Dr Flores’ purported fair
market valuation is less than 10% of the price that was agreed by the Parties in
2007/2008 under threat of expropriation;

(i) Ninth, there are multiple additional reality checks that validate the reasonableness
of Mr Giles’ valuations of KOMSA’s equity investment and KNI’s interest in the
Offtake Agreement; and

(j) Tenth, there are multiple further “lower bound” reality checks that discredit
Dr Flores’ valuation as an unsupportable outlier.

(i) The Claimants Have Demonstrated That the Respondent Must Pay Full
Compensation Under International Law

9.13 As submitted by the Claimants, the threshold issue is the determination of the appropriate

standard by which compensation is to be calculated by the Tribunal.

9.14 The Claimants contend that, as a matter of customary international law, the full reparation

standard articulated in the Chorzéw Factory Case*”™ is the appropriate standard of

compensation for the Respondent’s unlawful conduct.

On the other hand, as explained in more detail below, the Respondent contends that the
compensation standard in Article 6 of the Treaty should apply in respect of its allegedly

unlawful expropriation of the Claimants’ investments and its other treaty violations.

In response, the Claimants submit that the standard in Article 6 of the Treaty is inapplicable
where an expropriation has been carried out unlawfully, as here. Accordingly, the
Claimants submit that they are entitled to full compensation under the customary
international law standard in order to wipe out all of the consequences of the Respondent’s

unlawful conduct.

The Claimants accept that, in principle, there is a distinction in the standard of
compensation for a “lawful” expropriation and the standard of compensation for an
“unlawful” expropriation. That is, as they say, the standard of compensation for a lawful
expropriation is provided in Article 6 of the Treaty; but the standard of compensation for

an unlawful expropriation is full reparation under customary international law.

Notwithstanding this distinction, the Claimants accept that, in this case, there is no material
difference in result between the standard applicable under customary international law for
an “unlawful expropriation” and the standard applicable under the Treaty for a “lawful
expropriation”. Indeed, so the Claimants submit, both standards result in the calculation
of the “fair market value” of the expropriated investments absent the Respondent’s multiple

violations.

The Claimants contend that the application of the proper standard supports its three
submissions as to the appropriate compensation. These include, but are not limited to
recent arbitral decisions confirming that the Respondent must pay full compensation to the
Claimants in a “but for’ scenario for the unlawful expropriation of the Claimants’

investments.

The Claimants submit that recent decisions support the principle of full compensation in a

“but for” scenario for the unlawful expropriation of their investments. The Claimants cite

177

Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation,*”® where the tribunal,
referring to Article 35 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, explained that a “State
responsible for an illegal expropriation is in the first place obliged to make restitution by

putting the injured party into the position that it would be in if the wrongful act had not

477

taken place.” Similarly, they point to ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*'’, where the tribunal

decided:

“The Tribunal, coming back to the terms of the BIT, does not consider that the extent
of the compensation payable in respect of an unlawful taking of an investment, for
instance because it is in breach of an ‘undertaking’ in terms of Article 6(b), is to be
determined under Article 6(c): that provision establishes a condition to be met if the
expropriation is in all other respects in accordance with Article 6. So, in the
Chorzéw case, the Court did not determine reparation in accordance with the
provisions of the Convention before it, because it was concerned with a dispossession
in breach of those provisions. It decided in accordance with ‘the essential principle’
quoted earlier, that is a principle of customary international law, not dependent on
the Convention provisions.”

9.21 Accordingly, the Claimants contend that arbitral jurisprudence confirms that KOMSA is

entitled to full compensation under international law for the losses caused by the

Respondent’s non-expropriation violations of the Treaty.

(ii) Testimony from the Second (November) Hearing Demonstrated That the Parties’
Quantum Experts Have Adopted Fundamentally Different Approaches To the

Valuation Exercise
9.22 The Claimants note that there is a difference of more than US$ 518 million between the
Parties’ experts’ evidence in relation to the equity valuation, offtake valuation and
KOMSA’s Historical Losses (the latter of which have already been addressed in Part VIII
above). The Claimants contend that this large gulf between the two quantum experts’

valuations can, in large part, be explained by their fundamentally different approaches to

476 Hulley Enterprises Limited (Cyprus) v. The Russian Federation, PCA Case No. AA 226, Final Award (18 July
2014) (CLA-152), Paragraph 1766 (annulled by the Hague District Court on other grounds, but currently under
appeal).

the valuation exercise. The Claimants rely on their quantum expert, Mr Giles, who they
contend has adopted a forensic approach to the determination of his valuation parameters

in contrast to Dr Flores.

Specifically, the Claimants contend that Mr Giles’ valuation reflects the available
contemporaneous documentary evidence surrounding the revenues earned and the costs
incurred at the FertiNitro Plant. As such, so the Claimants contend, Mr Giles was able to
determine whether the revenues and costs that appear in FertiNitro’s accounts are reliable

for the purposes of projecting future revenues and costs at the Plant, in a “but for scenario”.

The Claimants further contend that Mr Giles was right to ignore the serious irregularities
and a lack of transparency with respect to important cost data recorded in FertiNitro’s
accounts to arrive at a fair market valuation. That approach is, it is contended, consistent
with what a willing buyer and willing seller would do, namely analyse the historical output
at the FertiNitro Plant to determine if that data is a reliable source for the forecasting long-

term output at the Plant.

According to the Claimants, Mr Giles’ evidence is also supported by the evidence of Mr
Sanders, who at the Second (November) Hearing, confirmed that, in October 2010, a
willing buyer would have viewed FertiNitro as a plant with substantial opportunities for
improvement on both the costs and production side. The Claimants describe Mr Sanders
as “the only independent industry expert in this arbitration”.*”> The Claimants submit that
Mr Sanders’ evidence is consistent with what the Respondent itself has realised since the
expropriation, overseeing a number of improvements to the FertiNitro Plant. Indeed, the
Claimants specifically point to Mr Sanders’ evidence that his analysis of the

contemporaneous documents revealed:*””

“Prior to the expropriation, the FertiNitro board expressed serious concern about
this out of control spending, and they requested some additional documentation that
would, through comparative charts and explanations of the costs, fully explain and
allow a transparent look at what the money was being spent on. These costs have no

documentary support. The requested documents that should explain the complete
cost breakdown of this out of control spending was again requested, but however was
never provided by Venezuela.”
According to the Claimants, the expert evidence of Mr Giles, insofar as it demonstrates
that the FertiNitro Plant was not a “flawed plant”, is supported not only by Mr Sanders, but
also by the admissions of the Respondent’s witness, Mr Anibal Villarroel. In particular,
the Claimants point to the ammonia trains at the FertiNitro Plant having operated at almost

6,480

100% of nameplate capacity on an annualized basis in 200 and to the fact that the urea

trains at FertiNitro were capable of producing 2,200 tonnes per day.**!

The Claimants conclude that the cash flow inputs adopted by Mr Giles are supported by
contemporaneous documents, the independent expert testimony of Mr Sanders and

admissions by the Respondent’s witness, Mr Villarroel, under cross-examination.

The Claimants also point to various deficiencies in the Respondent’s evidence. In
particular, the Claimants contend that the Respondent has not provided any credible
account of the irregular and escalating maintenance and turnaround costs incurred at
FertiNitro since 2008. Under cross-examination, Dr Flores stated that he had relied on Mr

Villarroel’s account of turnaround and maintenance costs at the Plant:4*?

“Q. [YJou relied on Mr Villarroel because you assumed that he had a good
understanding of the maintenance and turnaround costs, correct?

Yet, the Claimants point to the fact that Mr Villarroel admitted that, as Operations

Manager, he was not responsible for, nor did he even know about, costs at FertiNitro:*8>

authorized, I’ve got nothing to do with that, and in the day-to-day business, I’m miles
away from that.”
9.30 The Claimants contend that the expert evidence of Dr Flores cannot be relied upon because

it is a mistaken coalescence of:

(a) a series of assertions that are either outside the evidential record or are beyond his

expertise; and

(b) a mechanical averaging of data and sources without any appreciation of the

contemporaneous and industry evidence.

9.31 As to (a), the Claimants’ criticism is far ranging. They contend that Dr Flores sought to
testify on subjects such as: security and safety on Venezuelan roads; Venezuelan legal
procedure; and Venezuelan labour markets and contracting processes. During his

testimony, he also assumed what the Claimants describe as:

“[T]he mantle of fertiliser plant, commodities trading and legal expert, opining on
issues such as (1) turnarounds, maintenance and plant operations; (2) engineering
and construction of fertiliser plants; (3) costs incurred at fertiliser plants; (4) arbitral
procedure and decisions; and (5) ammonia and commodities trading” .“**

 

9.32 As to (b), the Claimants submit that, in contrast to Mr Giles, Dr Flores has “adopted a
mechanical average of production and costs data without considering whether a willing
buyer and willing seller would have adopted such data to project future cash flows at the
FertiNitro plant”.**° In particular, the Claimants point to Dr Flores’ failure to consider the
available contemporaneous documents or investigate the exceptionally high maintenance
and turnaround costs incurred at FertiNitro from 2008. It follows, the Claimants say, from

the failure to investigate the irregularities, that his valuation is “abjectly depressed.”4*°

(iii) The Parties’ Quantum Experts Agree on a Number Of Compensation Parameters;

9.33. At the Second (November) Hearing, the Parties were asked, in the course of their further
submissions, to identify any points of agreement and disagreement between their respective
quantum experts; and in relation to each point of disagreement, indicate whether the
quantum experts disagreed because of a factual matter or because of a difference of

expertise.

9.34 The Claimants’ later submissions adopted that structure, their Tables 1 to 4 at Paragraph

149 of their Post-Hearing Brief identifying, respectively:

(a) the relevant issues subject of agreement between Mr Giles and Dr Flores and the

nature of their agreement (Table 1);
(b) the points of disagreement in relation to the Equity Valuation (Table 2);
(c) _ the points of disagreement in relation to Offtake Valuation (Table 3); and

(d) the points of disagreement in relation to the Historical Losses (Table 4). (The

Return on Assets used
as the discount rate

Giles First
Report, §4.46

 

Flores First
Report, §94

The discount rate formula is agreed
between the two experts. The return
on assets is used as the discount
rate in both the Equity Valuation
and the valuation of the Offtake
Agreement. Although, the
methodology and formula are
therefore agreed, the inputs are not
(as to which, see Tables 2 and 3
below).

 

 

Inclusion of country
premium in
discount rate

 

Giles First
Report, §4.50

Flores First
Report, §94

Both experts add a country risk
premium to the return on assets to
account for country risk, although
the experts disagree on the
appropriate amount of the country
tisk premium (as to which, see
Tables 2 and 3 below).

FertiNitro to country risk in
Venezuela, although the experts
disagree on the appropriate level of
lambda (as to which, see Tables 2

Dr Flores applies a Lambda of

not affect its calculations,
whereas Mr Giles’ Lambda
lowers the country risk premium
substantially. D. Flores

The Claimants identified the Parties’ most significant points of disagreement in relation to:
the quantum expert witnesses’ projections of future cash flows at FertiNitro (sub-section
(d) below); the Offtake Agreement (sub-section (e) below); and the discount rate and
country risk premium applicable to the equity and offtake valuations (sub-section (f)

below).

(iv) Central Points of Agreement and Disagreement in Relation to Future Cashflows at
FertiNitro

According to the Claimants, as indicated above, the Parties’ quantum experts agree that the

estimate of future output at the FertiNitro Plant should be based on the actual levels of

ammonia and urea production achieved at the Plant over a certain period. However, beyond

this bare agreement, the experts disagree about which historical period of time should be

used to forecast future output at FertiNitro. That disagreement is significant, as submitted

by the Claimants.

As set out at Table 2 above, Mr Giles uses the average of production achieved at FertiNitro
between 2006 and 2008. Dr Flores, on the other hand, uses the average of production
achieved at FertiNitro between 2006 and 2010. The difference between the quantum
experts on this point reduces Mr Giles’ equity valuation by US$ 25.7 million and the
Offtake Valuation by a further US$ 9.2 million.

While both experts agree that the 2006 to 2008 period is an appropriate benchmark for
forecasting future output at FertiNitro, their disagreement turns largely on whether or not
the reduced output at FertiNitro during the years of 2009 and 2010 should also be included

in the benchmark period.

Mr Giles’ explanation at the Second (November) Hearing about the disfunctionality of the

2009 and 2010 years was as follows:

“[The] 2009 and 2010 [period] is a particularly unsuitable period to use as a basis
[for estimating future production at FertiNitro]. There are one-off costs, one-off
curtailments caused by the start of the METOR 2 project, which just can’t be included
in an estimate, an ongoing estimate of performance. And clearly, it is well
documented, [there was] a distracted board, severe cost controls and management
issues, until late 2010. In my view, in my judgment, 2006 [...] to 2008 represents a

199

9.41

9.42

9.43

balanced view. I am not idealising the plant, nor am I creating the worst
possible picture.”*”?
Mr Giles testified that the 2006 to 2008 period (which he uses) was far from an “ideal”
production scenario as the FertiNitro Plant achieved production that was “virtually 10%
below the EPC level.” It follows, so the Claimants submit, that his evidence is
conservative: the Plant had demonstrated an ability to meet nameplate production. In this
regard, the Claimants again point to the evidence of Mr Villarroel under cross-examination

that the urea plant at FertiNitro could be expected to achieve 100% EPC level.*°”

In relation to Dr Flores’ expert evidence, the Claimants submit that he does no more than
mechanically adhere to his averaging approach. Specifically, he ignores the factors that
depressed output in 2009 and 2010. He forecast a level of future output that is, in fact,
even lower than the Respondent’s own post-expropriation forecast. By contrast, the
Claimants point to the valuation prepared by Advantis for the Respondent’s settlement
negotiations, which showed that the Respondent expected that, in the future, FertiNitro
would produce higher figures.*"! (Dr Flores, on the other hand, forecast only 1,730 MT/day
of ammonia and 2,150 MT/day of urea).°°? The Claimants contend that the fact that
Advantis’ valuation for the purposes of post-expropriation negotiations is higher than Dr

Flores’ output forecasts fatally undermines his evidence.

According to the Claimants, the second major source of disagreement between the Parties’
quantum experts turns upon the maintenance and turnaround costs at the FertiNitro Plant.
The Claimants, on one hand, say that Mr Giles has evaluated the documentary record and
has determined that the most reliable source for forecasting future maintenance costs is the
budgets prepared by FertiNitro’s plant management between 2006 and 2008. Mr Giles

testified that the most reliable source for forecasting future turnaround costs is the budget

prepared by FertiNitro’s plant management for the 2008 turnaround. On the other hand,
the Claimants contend that Dr Flores has adhered to his mechanical averaging of the actual
maintenance costs incurred at FertiNitro between 2006 and September 2010. More
specifically, with respect to his projection of future turnaround costs, Dr Flores has
averaged: (1) the cost of the 2008 turnaround; and (2) the budgeted cost prepared by

FertiNitro’s plant management in respect of the 2010 turnaround.
The Claimants make four main submissions in support of their position:

(a) First, they submit that the FertiNitro budgets are the only reliable source for the

projection of future maintenance and turnaround costs at the Plant;

(b) Second, there are what Mr Giles describes as “serious irregularities” with the
actuals that render them unreliable for the purposes of projecting future

maintenance and turnaround costs at FertiNitro;

(c) Third, Dr Flores’ maintenance and turnaround cost assumptions are based on a
mechanical approach that ignores contemporaneous evidence of “serious

irregularities” with maintenance and turnaround costs at FertiNitro; and

(d) Fourth, the Respondent’s purported “inflation” theory does not explain the high

maintenance and turnaround costs incurred at the Plant.
It is again necessary to describe further each of these submissions.

As to (a) — the “reliability of the FertiNitro budgets”: Mr Giles explains that the
management budgets provide the most reliable indicator for future maintenance and
turnaround costs at the Plant.°°? Indeed, so the Claimants say, such budgets have been
regularly adopted by ICSID tribunals to project future costs. They point to Venezuela

Holdings v. Venezuela (also referred to as ExxonMobil case),

where, having been
presented with a number of options (one of which included a 2006 business plan containing

the budgeted operating expenses for 2007), Venezuela argued that the 2007 budget required

“various adjustments in order to develop the operating costs projections.” The tribunal
rejected this argument and held that the “[budgeted expenses were] the best indicator of
what the Project participants expected to happen in the future in the absence of any adverse

measures taken by the Venezuelan authorities.”*°°

9.47 The Claimants contend that exactly the same rationale applies here. It follows that the
reasons for utilising management budgets in forecasting future costs at FertiNitro are
overwhelming. This is so particularly with regard to the unreliable nature of the alleged

actual costs prior to the expropriation in October 2010.

9.48 As to (b) — the “serious irregularities”: the Claimants contend that the budgets are the only
reliable source available to the Tribunal for the purposes of projecting future maintenance

and turnaround costs at the Plant.

9.49 The Claimants point, in particular, to the August 2010 minutes of FertiNitro’s board of
directors. There, the costs were described as spiralling “out of control.”*°’ The Claimants
contend that, by 2010, it was clear to the Board that the costs at FertiNitro had become
grossly inflated through the award of unauthorised contracts by Pequiven’s plant

management personnel. Indeed, the Minutes of that Board meeting record:°°*

“[...] five (5) contracts that collectively implied obligations for FertiNitro of
approximately US$ 56 million, and that the new Management proceeded to rescind,
since these contracts did not comply with suitable bidding procedures and lacked
some of the qualified contractors that justify their selection. Additionally, it was
reported that in all of these contracts, the General Manager acted in violation of the
limits of authorization and financial delegation approved by the Board of Directors.”

9.50 The Claimants contend that these unauthorised contracts undoubtedly contributed to the

exceptionally high maintenance and turnaround costs incurred at the Plant.

While resolutions were passed at the FertiNitro board of directors’ meeting of August 2010
setting out specific procedures and a timeline for the selection of external auditors and the
appointment of an internal audit department, none of those resolutions or requests of the
board were carried out, because (so the Claimants contend) the Respondent expropriated

FertiNitro in October 2010.

As to (c) — ignorance of the “serious irregularities”: the Claimants contend that Dr Flores
himself accepted that there were irregularities to which regard should have been had in
undertaking the valuation exercise. In particular, they refer to his admission that “[i]f you
had [...] very serious concerns, then maybe yes, maybe those costs would have to be
excluded.”* Irrespective of these matters, Dr Flores calculated the costs on a simple
average. The Claimants say that these matters are significant and require the rejection of

his evidence.

As to (d) — the “inflation” theory: the Claimants contend that no credible explanation has
been given by the Respondent as to the maintenance and turnaround costs incurred at the
Plant. In what the Claimants described as a “last-ditch attempt to explain these costs,”>!°
the Respondent put forward an explanation that the significant maintenance and turnaround
costs were the result of inflation. Dr Flores adopted that theory for the first time at the
Hearing. The Claimants submit that it should be rejected, pointing to Mr Giles’ rejection

of inflation,*!! together with its absence from any of the contemporaneous documents.*!”

According to the Claimants, the third major source of disagreement concerns the
turnaround periods. The Claimants contend that, consistent with Mr Giles’ evidence, the
EPC Basis for Proposal confirmed that the project sponsors expected that there would be a
turnaround at FertiNitro every three years. The Claimants criticise the approach adopted

by the Respondent, on the basis of Dr Flores’ evidence, namely that a simple average

should be applied. That is to say, rather than adopt a three-year turnaround, Dr Flores’ use
of a turnaround of 2 / years is flawed, being based on the occurrence of two turnarounds
in the period from 2006 to 2010. It follows, so the Claimants contend, that Mr Giles’
assessment is the only one that is supported by the contemporaneous evidence,

international benchmarks and the independent opinion of Mr Sanders.

(v) Central Points of Agreement and Disagreement in Relation to Valuation of the
Offtake Agreement

The Claimants identify the central point of disagreement between the Parties’ quantum

experts in relation to the Offtake Agreement as the methodology that should be used for

the valuation of KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement.

The Claimants point to what they contend is the preferable approach of Mr Giles, namely

three steps, as follows:

(a) calculation of the sales price for urea and ammonia in the USA (based on FertEcon

projections as at October 2010);

(b) — the purchase price of ammonia and urea under the Offtake Agreement (again, based

on FertEcon projections as at October 2010); and
(c) the cost of shipping between FertiNitro and the USA.

Mr Giles then applies his discount rate to calculate the net present value of the Offtake

Agreement.

The Claimants point to the evidential support for this approach by Mr Jim Sorlie, who
testified as to the Caribbean fertilizer market, such evidence being “unrebutted” by the
Respondent and also discrediting Dr Flores’ assumption of a spot market for fertilizer

products at the so-called “mid Caribbean” price.

The Claimants contend that Dr Flores has undertaken no valuation of the Offtake
Agreement as at October 2010. Instead, the Claimants submit that the use of the

replacement value employed by Dr Flores is contrary to the standard for compensation

204

9.60

9.61

9.62

under customary international law. Such approach requires a determination of fair market

value (not replacement value) as at the date of expropriation.

In relation to Dr Flores’ approach, the Claimants also point to a number of matters which

undermine it, namely (as contended by the Claimants):

(a) His unsupported assumption that KNI could replace the tonnes lost at a “mid
Caribbean price”, such assumption being contrary to the unrebutted evidence of
Mr Sorlie that there is virtually no product available for KNI to purchase in the

Caribbean market;>!3

(b) His unsupported factual assumptions, including his statement that “Ammonia
produced in Venezuela doesn’t taste or doesn’t look any different from ammonia

produced in the Black sea ” 14 and

(c) His failure to mention that almost of all of the articles upon which he relied post-

date the expropriation of October 2010.

Finally, in relation to the Respondent’s contention that the discovery and exploitation of
shale gas in the USA has an impact, the Claimants contend that the post-2010 US shale gas
developments cannot influence the fair market value of the Offtake Agreement as at
October 2010. Indeed, as a matter of fact, so the Claimants contend in reliance on Mr
Sorlie’s evidence, even in 2014 (four years after the expropriation), the USA was expected
to remain a very large net importer of fertilizer products.°!> On the other hand, Mr Sorlie’s
evidence confirmed that the exploitation of shale gas in the USA would not materially
affect Mr Giles’ valuation of the Offtake Agreement, even as at 2014. That evidence, so

the Claimants contend, is unrebutted by the Respondent.

In summary, therefore, the Claimants contend that Mr Giles’ Offtake Valuation complies
with the applicable legal standard, is based on reliable documentary and witness evidence

and reflects a clear understanding of the Caribbean fertiliser market. This is to be

9.64

contrasted, so the Claimants say, with Dr Flores’ Offtake Valuation, which is factually and
legally flawed, betrays a misunderstanding of the Caribbean fertiliser market and is

undermined by documentary and witness evidence.

(vi) Central Points of Agreement and Disagreement in Relation to the Discount Rate and
the Country Risk Premium

It is necessary now to turn to two further matters of disagreement between the Parties,

namely the discount rate and the country risk premium components of the DCF model.

As to the discount rate, the Claimants rely on Mr Giles’ rate of 10.1% in preference to Dr

Flores’ rate of 20.4%.

Noting that each expert has incorporated a market risk premium and a country risk
premium into his expert rate, the Claimants point to Table 5 at Paragraph 197 of their Post-
Hearing Brief (which is reproduced below) as demonstrating the downward effect of

market and country risk assessments upon their respective valuations:

TABLE 5: Valuation Scenarios

Valuation with market risk and added Venezuela US$ 361.0 million USS 34.6 million

9.66

The Claimants emphasise that Mr Giles has incorporated both market risk and country risk
into his Equity Valuation and Offtake Valuation. They contend, accordingly, that Mr Giles
has thus adopted a discount rate that takes into account all market and country risks that
potentially affect the Claimants’ investments in Venezuela, even though this results in a

very substantial reduction to his valuation.

206

9.67

9.68

9.69

On the other hand, the Claimants describe Dr Flores’ discount rate as being a “‘contrived”

higher discount rate.>!°

In brief, the Claimants criticise Dr Flores for selecting an
exaggerated market risk premium and an inflated generic country risk premium that fails
to take into account FertiNitro’s specific exposure to Venezuelan country risk. According

to the Claimants, there are several elements in such criticism.

First, the Claimants contend that Dr Flores has adopted an inflated market risk premium
that depresses the valuation of the Claimants’ investments. That market risk premium was
6.7%. At the Second (November) Hearing, Mr Giles explained that, out of 12 possible
sources of market risk premia on the record of this arbitration (ranging from 3% to 6.7%),
Dr Flores has selected the source that yields the highest possible market risk premium.>!”
The Claimants contend that this stands in stark contrast to Mr Giles’ market risk premium,
which falls around the mid-point of the range of possible sources of market risk premium.
The Claimants submit that the selection of an exaggerated market risk premium is a
“blatant demonstration of reverse financial engineering by Dr Flores.”>!® The Claimants
point, in this regard, to the fact that the market risk premium selected by Dr Flores is almost
twice as high as the market risk premium of 3.5% adopted by the Respondent from the
post-expropriation equity valuation commissioned from Advantis for the purposes of
settlement negotiations.*!? In brief, the Claimants contend that Dr Flores’ approach is not
a realistic representation of what a willing buyer and willing seller would have agreed in a

transaction as at October 2010.

Second, despite starting at the same generic starting point (namely, Professor Damodaran’s
generic country risk premium for Venezuela), the Claimants say that Dr Flores’ analysis
takes three measures of Venezuelan country risk, averages them, and then fails to analyse
the individual attributes of FertiNitro to determine exposure to country risk. The Claimants

focus on the fact that Dr Flores has not explained why the averaging of multiple sources

9.74

(each of which provided vastly different country risk rates) provides an accurate

methodology for calculating the country risk rate for Venezuela.

It follows, so the Claimants submit, that Mr Giles’ methodology should be preferred. He
used a generic country risk premium of 6%, which he then adjusts: (1) to eliminate the
impact of illiquidity (since the fair market value standard requires an assumption that there
are no liquidity issues); and (2) to reflect FertiNitro’s specific exposure to Venezuelan

country risk i.e., the lambda factor.

The Claimants contend that Mr Giles’ analysis is to be preferred because he acknowledges
that FertiNitro, like every investment, is unique. He based his generic country risk
premium on Professor Damodaran’s estimate of 6.75% for the generic country risk in
Venezuela. He then reduced Professor Damodaran’s estimate by 0.75% to take into
account survey data that is representative of what market participants use in what he says

are “real world” transactions.

It follows, so the Claimants contend, that the Tribunal should use the only source that both
experts in the arbitration agree is an appropriate source for assessing the generic country
tisk for Venezuela; that is, the estimates provided by Professor Damodaran - with the

adjustments made by Mr Giles.

On this latter point, the Claimants conclude that the appropriate rate should be adjusted by
reference to a liquidity adjustment. That is, the generic country risk must be reduced to
remove the risk of an illiquid market. This results, so Mr Giles testifies, in a reduction of

1% (from 6% to 5%).

Third, the Claimants point to the fact that the experts agree in principle on the application
of a FertiNitro-specific country risk adjustment in the form of a lambda. The experts are
agreed that, in principle, a lambda factor should be applied in order to determine an

investment-specific country risk premium. As Mr Giles explained:*”°

520 Second (November) Hearing D6.15 (Giles).

208

9.75

9.76

9.77

“It must be uncontroversial, and I think even Dr Flores accepts that an investor
would pay more for an investment that is more insulated from risk than a typical
company. It must be uncontroversial, it’s set out in Dr Damodaran’s work and
elsewhere. So we need to assess, make a judgment about the relative exposure of
FertiNitro to Venezuelan country risk.”
The Claimants complain that Dr Flores has not, in fact, calculated a lambda factor. The
end result, say the Claimants, is that Dr Flores agrees with the application of a lambda
factor, but he has failed to undertake the detailed investment-specific analysis that this

approach requires.

Fourth, the Claimants conclude that Mr Giles is the only quantum expert witness who has
actually applied the agreed lambda approach and thereby assessed the extent to which

FertiNitro is exposed to Venezuelan country risk.

The Claimants contend that, although Dr Flores later claimed to have applied a lambda
factor, the evidence at the Second (November) Hearing confirmed that only Mr Giles has
conducted a proper examination of FertiNitro’s exposure to Venezuelan country risk. They
point to Mr Giles’ detailed analysis of the extent to which FertiNitro is exposed to 22
distinct risk factors that comprise the country risk for Venezuela. Ultimately, Mr Giles
determined that an appropriate lambda factor of 0.4 was to be applied. As Mr Giles

explained:>”!

“[First], on the revenue side, there is no specific price risk in Venezuela. Absent the
Urea Decree, all prices are set internationally under the Offtake Agreement. So it
doesn’t matter what happens in the Venezuelan economy, the prices are set
internationally.

The demand, the demand is entirely set internationally. The international markets —
the international price can take any volume FertiNitro can produce, so irrespective
of what’s happening in the Venezuelan market, FertiNitro can sell its product. Now
that’s actually quite different from a typical firm, a farm, a bakery, a hotel. Typical
firms are very exposed to local economic conditions.”

521 Second (November) Hearing D6.16 (Giles).

209

9.78 The Claimants point to the fact that Mr Giles has implemented a forensic approach that
looks at a host of country risk factors. The Claimants also point to the fact that Mr Giles
emphasises that the FertiNitro Plant is located in a secure location, and has low exposure
to risks associated with social disorder, political strikes and organised crime. It has access
to a dedicated dock to export its products; and FertiNitro does not require external funding
for its operations. Further, it has low exposure to Venezuelan infrastructure and

transportation risks.

9.79 The Claimants submit that Mr Giles is to be contrasted with Dr Flores, who admitted under
cross-examination at the Second (November) Hearing that he had not independently
studied the 22 country risk elements analysed by Mr Giles when calculating the lambda

factor.*2?

9.80 The Claimants further contend that Mr Giles’ assessment of, and conclusions about, the
lambda factor are consistent with those of the international credit rating agency, Moody’s,
in its contemporaneous determination of the risks associated with FertiNitro’s corporate
debt. At the commencement of the project, Moody’s undertook a comparative analysis of
the risk ratings of Venezuela and the FertiNitro project. The analytical approach
undertaken by Moody’s in determining the bond rating of FertiNitro’s corporate bonds is,
so the Claimants submit, similar to the approach taken by Mr Giles in determining the
lambda factor. Moreover, international credit rating agencies rated FertiNitro’s bonds as

being less risky than Venezuela’s sovereign debt.

9.81 In contrast, the Claimants contend that Dr Flores’ ad hoc implementation of a lambda of
1.0 is contradicted by the contemporaneous assessments of the international credit rating
agencies. Under cross-examination, Dr Flores agreed that the Moody report (Exhibit BE-
19) confirms the accepted position that country risk needs to be measured with respect to

the specific asset or investment concerned. In this regard, he explained:***

“@Q. So again the analysts from Moody’s here are saying when you’re making these

kinds of assessments, you have to look at every project on an individual basis,

correct? A. Yes, generally yes.”
The Claimants contend that, notably, Dr Flores acknowledged that, at the commencement
of the FertiNitro project, Moody’s had confirmed that FertiNitro was less exposed to
Venezuelan country risk than other companies operating in Venezuela.*”* The Claimants
point to similar analytical criteria used by other agencies, such as Fitch®*> and Duff &
Phelps.*?° It follows, so the Claimants contend, that these contemporaneous conclusions
corroborate the conclusions reached by Mr Giles on the /ambda and, equally, confirm that

Dr Flores’ conclusion is an outlier.

Further, the Claimants note that Moody’s noted that foreign investors can abate their
exposure to country risk by structuring their transactions in order to benefit from the
protections afforded under investment treaties. Yet Dr Flores has assumed the opposite,
assuming that the existence of the Treaty does not, in any way, mitigate the country risk
with respect to the Claimants’ investments. This demonstrates what the Claimants suggest
is another flaw with Dr Flores’ assumption that a willing buyer and seller would view
FertiNitro and the Offtake Agreement as being as exposed to Venezuelan country risk as

the average asset located in Venezuela, resulting in a lambda of 1.00.

The Claimants contend that the arbitrariness of Dr Flores’ lambda of 1.00 is further
illustrated by the fact that he has entirely ignored the Offtake Agreement in his analysis.
Mr Giles confirmed in his second report that “the Offtake Agreement is immune to changes
in local costs in Venezuela, thus making it even less akin to a typical firm in Venezuela.”*””

And yet, as he confirmed at the Second (November) Hearing, Dr Flores has simply applied

the same 1.00 lambda to the Offtake Valuation without any separate assessment of the

Offtake Agreement’s exposure to Venezuelan country risk.°”

The Claimants again point to the fact that Dr Flores’ analysis is contrary to the
contemporaneous record and real-life valuation practice. International rating agencies, for
example, have confirmed that the existence of an offtake agreement mitigates exposure to

country risk.°”?

In summary, therefore, the Claimants contend that Dr Flores’ opaque, superficial and self-
serving exposition of the lambda issue is egregiously wrong, given the dramatic effect that

the lambda has on both the Equity and Offtake Valuations.

(vii) The Award in Gold Reserve Inc v. Venezuela Supports The Fertinitro-Specific
Country Risk Premium Adopted By The Claimants’ Quantum Expert, Mr Giles, And
Discredits The Generic Country Risk Premium Adopted by the Respondent’s
Quantum Expert, Dr Flores; By Contrast the Awards in the Exxonmobil And Mobil
Cases Do Not Identify Any Country Risk Premium For Venezuela And Are Clearly
Distinguishable

In relation to the issue of country risk, the Claimants contend that the award in Gold

Reserve v. Venezuela>*°

supports the FertiNitro-specific country risk premium adopted by
Mr Giles and discredits the generic country risk premium adopted by Dr Flores. Further,
the Claimants contend that the two awards in ExxonMobil and Mobil*' do not identify any

country risk for Venezuela and are clearly distinguishable.

The Claimants contend that the Gold Reserve award is of central relevance because of its
treatment of the discount rate and Venezuelan country risk. The tribunal in that case

adopted a discount rate based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), of

528 Second (November) Hearing D7. 170 (Flores).

10.09%>*? (which is virtually identical to Mr Giles’ like-for-like discount rate of 10.1%).

In doing so, the tribunal incorporated a country risk premium of 4% to the cost of equity.

The Claimants make four arguments in this regard which (as they contend) support their

approach, namely:

First, the Gold Reserve tribunal concluded that a 4% country risk premium “appropriately
considers political risks, together with other risks, but has not been over-inflated on account
of expropriation risks.”>* In that tribunal’s view “it is not appropriate to increase the
country risk premium to reflect the market’s perception that a State might have a propensity
to expropriate investments in breach of BIT obligations.”°*+ The Claimants further contend
that this aspect of the tribunal’s reasoning accords with the established international law

principle of nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria.>*>

This principle has been reaffirmed by the tribunal in Flughafen v. Venezuela, where the
tribunal explained: “A State that increases country risk via the adoption of new political
attitudes, adopted after an investment has materialized, cannot benefit from an unlawful

act attributable to it in order to reduce the compensation to be paid out.”**°

Second, the country risk premium adopted by the tribunal in Gold Reserve confirms that
an investment-specific approach to measuring country risk is required for the purposes of
valuation. The tribunal specifically rejected Venezuela’s “generic” country risk calculation
because it was “based on both full and ‘generic’ country risk for an investment in

Venezuela.”**7

It referred instead to an RBC Capital Markets valuation that was
investment-specific to Gold Reserve for the purposes of arriving at its 4% country risk

premium.

Third, in the Gold Reserve award, the country risk premium of 4% related to the cost of
equity. This resulted in a total cost of equity of 11.92% and a WACC of 10.09%. The

country risk premium element of the WACC was accordingly lower than 4%, as the WACC

 

is a measure not just of equity, but also debt (which would have a lower or no country risk
premium attached to it). The Claimants contend that the Parties’ experts agree that the
appropriate discount rate to be applied in this case is the return on assets. This rate is
effectively identical to the WACC (with the exception of the treatment of debt tax shields).
The return on assets is, like the WACC, the return to both debt and equity holders. As
such, in order to compare the country risk premium applied in the Gold Reserve award to
the country risk premium to be applied to FertiNitro, it is necessary to look not at the 4%
added by the Gold Reserve tribunal to the cost of equity, but to the premium that was
applied to the WACC. While the award does not specify what premium was applied to the
WACC in Gold Reserve, it must be lower than the 4% that the tribunal applied to the cost

of equity.

Fourth, as explained by Mr Giles (see above) FertiNitro is far less exposed to country risk
in Venezuela than the gold mine at issue in Gold Reserve. The mine was located in the
“environmentally fragile Imataca Forest Reserve” in the interior of Venezuela.*** This area
in southeast Venezuela is not easily accessible and has poor transportation links, even

compared to other remote locations in Venezuela.

Unlike Gold Reserve, the Claimants submit that the ExxonMobil and Mobil cases are
distinguishable from the present arbitration and the resulting awards offer no meaningful
precedent on the assessment of country risk and discount rate. ExxonMobil obtained these
awards in two separate arbitrations against Venezuela and its State-owned companies.
These awards relate to Venezuela’s expropriation of an extra-heavy oil project and other

investments formally held by the ExxonMobil group in Venezuela.

In relation to the ICC arbitration, Mobil Cerro Negro (“Mobil”) initiated arbitration
proceedings against PDVSA Cerro Negro SA (“PDVSA-CN”) and Petréleos de Venezuela

SA (“PDVSA”) pursuant to two inter-related agreements: (i) the “Association Agreement”
and (ii) the “PDVSA Guaranty”.°*? The ICC tribunal’s task was to “apply the common
intention of the Parties reflected in the [Association Agreement]”.*“° In particular, the ICC
tribunal was required to award compensation according to an indemnity formula provided
in the Association Agreement. In such circumstances, the ICC tribunal did not endorse
any particular country risk calculation for Venezuela. Instead, the ICC tribunal analysed
the valuation of future cash flows under the indemnity formula provided in the Association
Agreement. When analysing this issue, the ICC tribunal emphasised that “there is a
difference between valuing future cash flows under an indemnity formula and valuing the

potential cash flows from a project”.*#!

In these circumstances, the Claimants contend that the factors considered by the ICC
tribunal in order to determine the appropriate discount rate applicable to contractual
damages are demonstrably not relevant to the calculation of the discount rate for the DCF
valuation of an investment. The Claimants argue that neither Party nor expert in the present
case has advanced any discount rate analysis comparable to that undertaken in the ICC

award.

The Claimants also point to the fact that another distinguishing feature of the ExxonMobil
and Mobil cases is that the claimant had consistently argued for a risk-free rate (namely, a
discount rate that excluded any market risk premium and country risk premium). In
contrast, the Claimants’ discount rate formula includes a substantial market risk premium
(4.75%) and country risk premium (2%). The customary international law standard of full

reparation played no part in the ICC tribunal’s analysis.

In parallel with the ICC arbitration, a number of ExxonMobil subsidiaries brought an ICSID
arbitration against Venezuela under the Netherlands-Venezuela BIT.*? As in the ICC

case, in the ICSID case there was no evidence of any country risk calculation. The

52 Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela (RLA-153).

215

9.100

9.101

9.102

claimants had argued that country risk is largely comprised of “uncompensated
expropriation, which cannot be taken into consideration in order to valuate such an
expropriation.” In those circumstances, the Claimants submit that the ICSID award
contains no analysis whatsoever of Venezuelan country risk, let alone any analysis of
investment-specific risk or any final calculation for country risk. The ICSID tribunal

instead adopted a discount rate of 18% for the purposes of its DCF valuation.

It follows, so the Claimants contend, that, unlike the ExxonMobil and Mobil cases, the
evidence presented in this arbitration involves detailed arguments in support of the
Claimants’ country risk approach. In contrast to the ExxonMobil and Mobil cases, so the
Claimants contend, both Parties’ experts have advanced arguments focused on country risk
and both experts agree that the country risk premium to be adopted by the Tribunal must
be investment-specific (that is, using a lambda). The ExxonMobil and Mobil cases can
therefore be of no utility to the Tribunal in its assessment of country risk and lambda in

this arbitration.

The Claimants point to another example of a country risk assessment involving Venezuela
in the award made in Flughafen v. Venezuela.** There, the respondent proposed a country
risk premium of 7.9% and a discount rate of 14.4%.*44 The tribunal adopted the
respondent’s country risk premium based on the specific facts of the case: specifically, that,
when the claimants made their investments in 2004, the country risk already existed, the
investors were well aware of it and the risk had not changed by the time of the expropriation

soon afterwards, in December 2005.

Therefore, by way of summary, the Claimants conclude that the ICSID tribunal’s award in
Gold Reserve v. Venezuela is the most relevant legal authority in connection with country
risk (and particularly expropriation risk) and Jambda analysis that the Tribunal is required
to undertake in the present case. That decision endorses the FertiNitro-specific country
risk premium adopted by Mr Giles and discredits the generic country risk premium adopted

by Dr Flores. In contrast, so the Claimants say, the awards in the ExxonMobil and Mobil

9.105

cases are clearly distinguishable. As for Flughafen award, it is of relevance to the extent
that it endorses the proposition that no respondent should be allowed to benefit from its

own expropriatory conduct; but it is otherwise distinguishable on its facts.

(viii) The Adjusted MOU Price is an Effective Reality Check on the Parties’ Valuations; It
Demonstrates That Mr Giles’ Equity Valuation Is Conservative And That, By
Contrast, Dr Flores’ Purported Fair Market Valuation Is Less Than 10% Of The
Price That Was Agreed By the Parties In 2007 Under Threat of Expropriation.

In further support of the application of their proposed valuation, the Claimants point to Mr

Giles’ adjusted MOU price in 2007 as an effective reality check. They submit that it

demonstrates that Mr Giles’ Equity Valuation is conservative and, by contrast, that Dr

Flores’ purported fair market valuation is less than 10% of the price that was (allegedly)

“agreed” by the Parties in 2007 under the threat of expropriation.

In this regard, the Claimants contend that the evidence confirms that Mr Giles’ Equity
Valuation (namely, US$ 361.0 million for KOMSA’s 25% interest) is almost the same as
the MOU price as adjusted in a “but-for” scenario (US$ 360.8 million).**° For this
comparison, the Claimants contend that Mr Giles has simply calculated the MOU price in
the absence of the Respondent’s pre-expropriation violations of the Treaty (that is, “but
for” the economic impact of the Urea Decree and the unlawful taxes). As a result, the
Claimants contend that the adjusted MOU price confirms that Mr Giles has produced a
conservative Equity Valuation that very likely understates the value of KOMSA’s equity

investment in a “but-for” scenario.

In contrast, the Claimants point to the fact that Dr Flores has made a series of arbitrary
adjustments to the MOU price that have the effect of reducing the enterprise value listed in
the 2008 MOU by 55%. The Claimants describe this approach as a “piece of financial

reverse engineering”.*4°

45 See, for example, Giles ER1, Paragraphs 4.86, 4.88. The Claimants note that Mr Giles increases the MOU price
(namely, US212.5 million) by “25% of the expected impact, over the life of the Plant, of the Urea Decree and
unlawful taxes (namely, KOMSA’s share of this loss)” — it is this increase that results in an adjusted MOU price
of US$ 360.8 million as at 30 September 2010.

6 Cls, PHB, Paragraph 265.

217

9.106 The Claimants contend that the evidence of Dr Flores is to the effect that the distortion of
the MOU price is based on the fact that the draft MOU of November 2007 was only “a first
offer by Koch”.*4” This allows him to assert that the only moment in time that the MOU
was “agreed” was almost a year later in October 2008. The Claimants contend that this
evidence is contrived, and that such contrivance is exposed by the contemporaneous
evidence. The Claimants point to the fact that during his cross-examination, Dr Flores was
taken to an email from Mr Toro (as a director of Pequiven), to Messrs Parra and Gwaltney
(for KOMSA) dated 9 October 2007 (that is, approximately one month prior to the date of
the 2007 MOU), which stated:>48

“In accordance with an independent valuation carried out by Boo[z] Allen, hired by
Pequiven,*” and additional valuations carried out and discussed with the rest of the
partners, we have estimated a fair amount of one billion, one hundred and seventy-
five [million] U.S. dollars [...] for 100% of the shares [in FertiNitro].”

9.107 The Claimants contend that Mr Toro’s email message, sent only one month prior to the
November 2007 MOU, unequivocally confirms that the “first offer” was, in fact, made by
Pequiven. Thus, the November 2007 MOU (drafted by Koch) contained a price that was

agreed between the Parties in November 2007. The Claimants conclude that Dr Flores’

evidence should, therefore, be rejected. 550

48 Email from F. Toro to B. Gwaltney and T. Parra re: FertiNitro Negotiations (9 October 2007) (C-90).

*° Later known as Advantis.

550 In the Tribunal’s view, there is no cogent evidence that any MOU price was “agreed” in 2007 between Pequiven
and KOMSA. The first offer came via an email of 9 October 2007 from Mr Toro of Pequiven (C-90) with a
valuation of US$ 1.175 billion for 100% of the equity of FertiNitro, less the amount outstanding to its banks and
bondholders (which he put at US$ 450,000, presumably US$ 450 million). On 7 November 2007, KOMSA came
back with its draft MOU with a valuation of US$ 1.210 billion less the debts to the banks and bondholders plus
the Excess Cash in FertiNitro. Discussions were halted in early 2008. However, Pequiven came back again in
October 2008 with a revised draft MOU (C-93) which provided for a payment of US$ 212.5 million to KOMSA
for its share of FertiNitro’s equity. Ultimately, no MOU was ever agreed or signed. Pequiven contended that the
purchase of the private shareholders of FertiNitro was no longer a priority. However, Mr Parra (of KOMSA)
testified in his witness statement (Paragraph 69) that KOMSA’s representatives understood that there was no real
alternative but to accept Pequiven’s proposal (See also Cls. Mem., Paragraphs 144-153).

(ix) There Are Multiple Additional Reality Checks That Validate The Reasonableness of
Mr Giles’ Valuations of The Equity Investment and the Offtake Agreement

The Claimants also point to “multiple additional reality checks that validate the

reasonableness of Mr Giles’s valuations of the Equity Investment and the Offtake

551

Agreement, namely:

First, the Claimants point to the “project investment” for identical new fertiliser plants at
Guiria and the José Complex, whereby Pequiven (in its 2007-2013 Strategic Plan)
announced that it intended to invest US$ 2.8 billion to build each plant, each having an
equivalent nameplate capacity as FertiNitro’s Plant. Mr Giles’ evidence was that
“[rJeplacement value must be the minimum that an investor considers the plant to be

worth,” and that such value is a well-understood economic indicator of value.>>?

Second, the Claimants point to FertiNitro’s 2011 actual net profit of US$ 116.2 million
compared to a budgeted 2011 net profit of US$ 117.2 million. If (as Mr Giles explained)
the DCF methodology “involves projecting revenues and costs into the future”, these
amounts are a simple post-expropriation reality check, which undermines the credibility of
Dr Flores’ equity valuation and demonstrates the conservativeness of Mr Giles’ forecasts.
As to the former, Dr Flores forecasts that FertiNitro would have made net profits in 2011
of US$ 36.3 million, being approximately one third of the net profit that FertiNitro
achieved in 2011. In relation to the latter, Mr Giles forecasts net profits in 2011 of US$
92.1 million, being 20% less than what FertiNitro’s managers expected and then

ultimately achieved.

Third, the Claimants refer to the dividend payment to FertiNitro’s shareholders of
US$ 150 million in 2008 (of which US$ 37.5 million was distributed to KOMSA). They
note that this dividend was paid out of profits that had already been reduced by the
Respondent’s pre-expropriation violations but that, nevertheless, the amount is more than

Dr Flores’ entire Equity Valuation.

9.117

Fourth, the Claimants point to the net present value of the profits foregone by KNI of US$
172 million if Dr Flores’ own calculation of KNI’s profits during the period of the ad hoc
arrangement is applied over the remaining term of the Offtake Agreement. This reality
check rests on the “volumes offtaken” identified by Dr Flores himself at the Second
(November) Hearing. If the profit per month during the period of the ad hoc arrangement,
namely US$ 2.49 million, is applied over the remaining term of the Offtake Agreement
(being 123 months), the total net profit forgone is US$ 306 million. Applying Mr Giles’
discount rate, the net present value of the lost profits is US$ 172.7 million. That figure is
approximately US$ 33.8 million less than Mr Giles’ valuation of the Offtake Agreement,

and, so the Claimants contend, further corroborates its reasonableness.

The Claimants contend that these four factors should be considered by the Tribunal as other
tribunals have found it instructive to refer to “reality checks” to test the reasonableness of

disputed valuations placed before them.

(x) There Are Multiple Further “Lower Bound” Reality Checks That Discredit Dr
Flores’ Valuation as an Unsupportable Outlier
In addition to these factors, the Claimants point to further “lower bound” reality checks to

discredit Dr Flores’ valuations as an unsupportable outlier, namely:

First, the book value of FertiNitro as at the date of the expropriation equated to
US$ 168.1 million for KOMSA’s 25% equity in FertiNitro, after deduction for debt. That
figure is five times Dr Flores’ Equity Valuation. Book value is almost always less than

fair market value, especially when valuing a profitable going concern.*>*

Second, the construction costs alone of FertiNitro equated to US$ 273 million for 25% of
FertiNitro. Once again, the Claimants point to the multiple of Dr Flores’ valuation, in this

case the construction costs being eight times his valuation.

Third, the Respondent’s own post-expropriation position for the purposes of settlement

negotiations prepared by Advantis equated to US$ 113 million for 25% of FertiNitro. The

553 See ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela (CLA-155), Paragraphs 400-401.

220

9.118

9.119

(7)
9.120

Claimants again point to this amount as a “reality check,” contending that it shows that Dr
Flores adopted an inflated discount rate and country risk premium, and an overly
pessimistic forecast of future output levels at FertiNitro. This Advantis valuation was more

than three times the figure reached by Dr Flores.

Fourth, the Respondent’s “estimated project investment” for the smaller fertiliser plant
located at Méron was US$ 1.55 billion and the construction costs of that plant were US$ 2
billion. As the M6ron plant has a urea output of 726,000 metric tonnes per year, this means
that U$ 2,755 of construction costs will give one metric tonne of urea for the foreseeable
future.*°4 As Dr Flores’ Equity Valuation equates to US$ 355 per metric tonne of urea, Mr
Giles explained that no reasonable buyer would consider it possible to purchase FertiNitro
for US$ 355 per metric tonne when a commercial entity has plans to build a plant that will

cost US$ 2,755 per metric tonne.

Having regard to all these factors, the Claimants contend that Dr Flores’ valuations do not
even meet lower bound reality checks. The Claimants submit that, like Flughafen v.
Venezuela,*°> the Tribunal should reject any valuation outside those bounds. In short, so
the Claimants conclude, Dr Flores’ valuation is an outlier that cannot be supported. It is,
so the Claimants say, “a striking demonstration of the unreasonableness of Dr Flores’

depressed valuations.”*°°

The Respondent’s Quantum Submissions

The Respondent contends, primarily, that the Tribunal need not arrive at the point of
determining any quantum issues. Indeed, the Respondent’s submissions are explicitly

»557 However, the Tribunal has confirmed its

jurisdiction; and the Respondent is liable to the Claimants under Article 6 of the Treaty, as

9.121

9.124

of the Tribunal. Hence, the Respondent’s submissions on quantum must now be considered

by the Tribunal.

In summary, the Respondent’s case on quantum is comprised of four principal submissions.

These are:
(a) Its general submissions as to the flaws in the Claimants’ quantum submissions;
(b) The compensation claimed by KOMSA and KNI are both vastly overstated;

(c) The fair market value of KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro was not more than

US$ 34.6 million; and
(d)  KNI’s valuation of its interest in the Offtake Agreement is overstated.

(i) | The Respondent’s General Submissions

The Respondent makes, as already indicated, seven general submissions as to the

appropriate treatment of the issues of quantum for both KOMSA and KNI.

First, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have proposed a highly inflated value
that far exceeds what the Claimants’ claims would be worth in the absence of the disputed
acts. This is not compatible with the fair market value (“FMV”) standard that both Parties
agree applies to quantum. The FMV standard is an objective standard that leaves no room
for what, so the Respondent contends, is the arbitrary, highly speculative and policy-based

valuation that the Claimants ask the Tribunal to conduct in this case.

Second, as regards KOMSA, the Respondent contends that the Claimants disregard
standard DCF valuation principles by “cherry-picking” data that increases their valuation
outcome and by using out-dated budgeted data, even where more current actual data is fully
available. The Respondent criticises what it says is the Claimants’ only support for its
case, namely Mr Sanders’ experience with two plants based, respectively, in Oklahoma
and Trinidad & Tobago, both of which Mr Sanders himself concedes are not comparable
to the FertiNitro Plant. Moreover, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal should not

rely on cost assessments of a witness who is unaware of significant differences in key

222

9.125

9.126

9.127

9.128

economic indicators, such as inflation rates, between the three countries relevant to his

comparative cost assessment.

Third, the Respondent contends that the Claimants suggest, wrongly, an entirely
unreasonable discount rate. That suggestion is directly contradicted by three recent

international arbitration awards against the Respondent, two of which**

regard a project
located in the exact same industrial complex as FertiNitro and which share other important
commonalities with FertiNitro. Moreover, the Respondent submits that the country risk
rate of 2% contained in the Claimants’ discount rate is misplaced since it is based, amongst
other things, on an admittedly unrepresentative survey, an unprecedented application of a
liquidity discount and an arbitrary and unsupported lambda. A country risk rate of 2% is,
so the Respondent contends, the rate normally applied to such countries as Italy. Moreover,
such rate finds no support in the award made by the tribunal in Gold Reserve Inc v.

559

Venezuela’”’ which the Claimants claim — also incorrectly — supports their view.

Fourth, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ original “reasonableness” checks do
not support their valuation. Further, the additional comparisons that the Claimants
introduced for the first time at the Second (November) Hearing, such as FertiNitro’s book
value or the estimated project investments for new plants at Guiria and José, do not alter

that conclusion.

Fifth, the Respondent submits that KNI’s valuation of its interest in the Offtake Agreement
uses an incorrect valuation methodology, is based on insufficient evidence and ignores
fundamental changes in the USA and global fertilizer industry that were already taking

place at the valuation date.

Sixth, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ expert witness, Mr Giles, has, in
various instances, blindly relied on the purported expertise offered by others, such as Mr
Sanders or Mr Sorlie, without applying his own critical judgment. In contrast, the

Respondent contends that its expert witness, Dr Flores, has carefully considered the

558 Namely, Mobil v. PDVSA (EO-45); Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela (RLA-153).
559 Gold Reserve v. Venezuela (CLA-156).

223

9.129

9.130

9.131

FertiNitro Plant’s history, with its actual operating conditions in Venezuela, in his
valuation exercise. The Claimants’ repeated attempts to discredit Dr Flores by soliciting
his testimony on factual issues related to the valuation should fail before this Tribunal. It
is Dr Flores’ particular familiarity and personal experience with the conditions and
processes in Venezuela that make his valuation especially convincing and, at the same time,

29560

distinguishes it from Mr Giles’ “blind reliance’ on any information provided to him by

the Claimants.

In short, and for the reasons set out more fully below, the Respondent contends that the
Claimants’ damages claims in the amount of approximately US$ 672.4 million are vastly

overstated.

(ii) The Compensation Claimed by KOMSA and KNI is Vastly Overstated

The Respondent makes three main submissions as to, in its submission, the vast

overstatement of compensation by the Claimants. Those submissions are:

(a) First, the relevant standard of compensation is found in the Treaty, not in customary

international law;

(b) Second, irrespective of the legal standard for compensation, the Parties agree that

the quantum experts should apply the FMV standard; and
(c) Third, the Claimants ultimately fail to apply the FMV standard.

As to (a) — the relevant standard of compensation: the Respondent, in contrast to the
Claimants, contends that the relevant standard of compensation for the Claimants’ claims
is set out in Article 6 of the Treaty, and not in customary international law. It submits that
Article 6 of the Treaty is lex specialis to the customary international law standard of full
reparation. As such, under the Treaty standard, the Claimants’ claims are limited to “the
market value of the investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or

became public knowledge, whichever is earlier.” Being an objective standard, the market

560 Resp. PHB, Paragraph 177.

224

9.132

9.133

9.134

value standard here means that the valuation of KOMSA’s share in FertiNitro should not
exclude the alleged effects of certain Government measures predating the announcement

of the mandatory acquisition.*°!

The Respondent notes that all of the Respondent’s
measures about which the Claimants complain were of a general nature and not specific to

FertiNitro.

The Respondent contends that the Treaty standard applies irrespective of whether the

Respondent’s acquisition was lawful or unlawful.

As to (b) — the Parties’ agreement that the FMV standard should apply: the Respondent
points to the agreement between Mr Giles and Dr Flores that the Claimants’ claims should

be valued based on the FMV standard as at the valuation date of 30 September 2010.°*

As to the FMV standard, Dr Flores relies on the well-known definition in the World Bank
Guidelines that refer to “an amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing
seller.”>°? This definition is, so the Respondent contends, essentially identical to the FMV
definition Mr Giles provides at the outset of his First Report, in which he referred to “the
value at which a willing buyer and willing seller would exchange an asset.”>** Further, the
Respondent contends that it is consistent with the definitions of FMV used by the
International Valuation Standards Council.** The Respondent contends that Mr Giles
misinterprets the meaning of FMV as meaning a market devoid even of purely commercial
sales limitations. The Respondent adopts Dr Flores’ analysis, which it says shows that Mr
Giles’ interpretation turns the FMV standard “upside down”, since it improperly permits a

valuation of an asset at a value higher than one in the absence of the disputed acts.

°6! These are to be identified by reference to the Second (November) Hearing, Claimants’ Opening Statement, slide
31, suggesting that the effects of the Urea Decree, the Municipal tax, the Science & Technology tax, the delay in
VAT rebates and the interference by the Respondent with the management and operations of FertiNitro should be

As to (c) — the Claimants’ failure to apply the FMV standard: the Respondent contends that
whilst the Claimants agree on the use of the FMV standard, Mr Giles has ultimately failed
to apply that standard. Indeed, the Respondent submits that Mr Giles’ DCF valuation is
“entirely one-sided, full of inconsistencies, and — based on arbitrarily cherry-picked data —
evidently directed not at establishing the plant’s ‘fair’ market value but rather at creating
an ‘arbitration value’ which impermissibly ignores the troubled realities of the plant.”*°
Further, the Respondent contends that Mr Giles arbitrarily deviates from standard valuation
practice, including by relying on survey data which he himself recognizes “cannot be
considered representative”*® for his country risk rate calculation. He also reduces his
discount rate through a liquidity discount whereas such discount in standard valuation
practice is applied only to increase the discount rate. The Respondent, instead, relies upon
Dr Flores’ testimony, to the effect that no prospective sales transaction would ever have

been based on projections that are so obviously fabricated.

(iti) The Fair Market Value (FMV) of KOMSA’s Interest in FertiNitro Was no More Than
US$ 34.6 million

The Respondent contends that KOMSA’s 25% interest in FertiNitro was no more than US$

34.6 million. (This figure does not include interest and assumes the Urea Decree would

have continued to apply). On the other hand, so the Respondent submits, Mr Giles’

(corrected) valuation at US$ 361 million is vastly overstated and far exceeds the FMV of

KOMSA’s equity share in FertiNitro.

The Respondent rests these submissions on flaws in Mr Giles’ DCF valuation which are

said to be four-fold.

First, the Claimants’ DCF analysis is inconsistent and highly speculative. It involves the

“cherry-picking” of different time periods (that is, 2006-2008, 2006-2010 and the

6° Resp. PHB, Paragraph 183. These matters, according to the Claimants, include a history of construction defects,
poor maintenance decisions in the Plant’s early years, an above-average number of unplanned shutdowns,
persistent gas and electricity supply problems beyond FertiNitro’s and the Respondent’s control, and high

maintenance and turnaround cost

situation.

individual years of 2008 and 2010), as well as actual versus budgeted data. His valuation
depends on which alternative is chosen, thus enabling him to arrive at a higher valuation.
In contrast, Dr Flores consistently applies the same data period, namely the data period of
2006-2010, and accordingly ensures consistency. The Respondent points to the fact that
this is appropriate because it encompasses the two turnarounds conducted at the Plant in
the five years prior to the mandatory acquisition (that is, 2008 and 2010), consistently with

the forecast that turnarounds are to occur every 22 years.

Further, the Respondent relies on Dr Flores’ demonstration of the inappropriateness of Mr
Giles’ valuation: First, Mr Giles ignores the interrelatedness of the individual valuation
criteria. That is, maintenance and turnaround costs impact capital expenditures; both, in
turn, impact production levels, which, in turn, affect revenue and variable costs and
ultimately working capital. Mr Giles’ ignorance of these relationships is one of the factors
causing him to overvalue the Claimants’ alleged compensation claims. Second, Mr Giles’
approach bases his valuation on very short data periods of only three years of actual data
(2006-08) or, in some cases, only one year of actual (or budgeted) data, which contradicts
the fundamental principle underlying any DCF valuation to project future income streams

based on a reasonable quantity of historic data as available in a going concern.

Next, the Respondent contends that it is inappropriate to rely on budgeted data in this case
due to the inherent uncertainties and flaws in the budgeting process. As Mr Sanders noted
in his evidence, detailed records are necessary to properly prepare budgets, so deficiencies
in record keeping would likely affect the accuracy of a budget because it necessarily would
not reflect the true state of the equipment or the work to be performed during that year.*°*
It is not possible for the Claimants to rely on the ICSID award in Venezuela Holdings v.
Venezuela™® to argue that budgets are a reliable basis for forecasting. Rather, in that award,

using budgets for the year in which the expropriation took place was appropriate since

actual data was not available for the full year.>7 Here, however, Mr Giles seeks to use

budgets during years when actual data was available.

Second, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ DCF valuation inappropriately
excludes actual production volumes from 2009 and 2010 in projecting future production.
Indeed, the Respondent says that the Claimants’ approach “represents nothing but a
calculated attempt to present a rosier picture of the plant’s production volumes than the
available actual data indicates.”°’! The Respondent points to several factors showing why

this approach is inappropriate, as follows.

Mr Giles’ approach does not comport with FertiNitro’s turnaround cycle, since that cycle
was less than three years. His approach is flawed because Mr Sanders (and, in turn, Mr
Giles) based his cycle upon an (improper) alleged similarity between the FertiNitro Plant
and the plants of Terra OK and Point Lisa.°’”? Rather, the Respondent contends that Dr
Flores’ turnaround cycle of 2% years reflects the FertiNitro Plant’s actual history of
turnaround cycles; and it is conservative in the light of FertiNitro’s major construction

defects and history of frequent unplanned shutdowns.

Gas and electricity disruptions, as well as unplanned outages, were not materially higher

in 2009 and 2010 than in previous years.*7>

A hypothetical and realistic buyer in 2010 would not have assumed that FertiNitro could
consistently achieve nameplate production in the future. According to the Respondent, this
is because FertiNitro had never consistently achieved nameplate production levels. The

evidence at the Hearings did not provide any basis to assume that this would change in the

foreseeable future. In particular, the Plant’s machinery and equipment were not sufficient

to produce at nameplate levels consistently.

The Respondent relies upon Mr Villarroel’s evidence that the urea trains could achieve
daily nameplate capacity on a consistent basis, but not the ammonia trains.°”* Mr Sanders’
opinion that FertiNitro “should be able to achieve nameplate capacity on a consistent

basis’575

should be rejected because it is, again, based on a comparison of the FertiNitro
Plant with the plants at Terra OK and Point Lisa, which (as Mr Sanders admitted on cross
examination) are not comparable to FertiNitro. The Claimants’ allegation that FertiNitro’s
actual nameplate capacity can be assessed based on the 2003 Jacobs Report should be
rejected, since that report was evidently overtaken by the 2006 Jacobs Report, the latter
suggesting that it was not realistic to expect that FertiNitro would be able consistently to

produce at nameplate levels.

Further, the Respondent points to the Claimants’ failure to prove their allegation that
annual nameplate production could be achieved through process improvements. The

Respondent describes that allegation as “mere wishful thinking.”>”°

The Respondent
contends that the FertiNitro Plant’ s equipment was so degraded that operational fixes could
do little to resolve the low reliability of the Plant’s machinery and equipment. The
Respondent contends that the reliance on “two short marketing publications” created by
Honeywell (which are not, contrary to the Claimants’ nomenclature, “position papers’) is
irrelevant, and, further, those documents are prone to exaggeration and
oversimplification.*”’ According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ focus on operational
errors is also misleading, since the majority of unplanned shutdowns at FertiNitro were
caused by mechanical failures, water and gas leaks and fire, in addition to supply

disruptions beyond FertiNitro’s control.°”* Furthermore, the 2007 KBC Report, which

978 Indeed, the Respondent contends that an evaluation of the causes of the Plant’s shutdowns between 2003 and 2010
does not once cite operational errors as a significant cause of shutdowns in any of the years during this period. (See
Niveles de Produccion y Dias Operativos 2003-2010 (EO-41)). Likewise in a section entitled “FertiNitro’s
Complex History of Unplanned Shutdowns,” Jacobs Consultancy does not so much as mention operational errors

229

9.147

9.148

examines the origins and consequences of process failures, does not consider unplanned
shutdowns to be a consequence of any of the operational or process-based shortcomings it

finds.

As a result, the Respondent contends that, while later process improvements may have
reduced the limited number of shutdowns caused by operational mistakes, the far greater
number of shutdowns was due to mechanical failures and external outages, which
continued to hamper the Plant’s productivity. In any case, the Respondent contends that
there is no evidence that the implementation of the recommendations of the KBC Report
would have allowed FertiNitro to achieve nameplate production on a consistent basis. As
Mr Villarroel testified, any improvement in production levels would require “strong
investment and a not short period of time as well”.°”? After over ten years in operation
without sufficient preventative maintenance, simply reforming the Plant’s leadership and
improving its operational planning would do little to enhance production at FertiNitro
given the severely degraded state of the Plant’s equipment. Finally, the valuation exercise
must take into account the fact that this case concerns the acquisition of a 25% stake in

FertiNitro, and thus only KOMSA’s minority share in the business.>*°

In relation to the exclusion of actual production volumes from 2009 and 2010, the
Respondent contends that the Claimants’ submission, that such exclusion is justified by
law, is unfounded. The Respondent makes six main arguments why this submission should
be rejected. First, the Claimants have provided no evidence that the stoppages were
entirely due to supply disruptions by PVDSA and Pequiven. Second, Pequiven would not
be responsible for any breaches of PVDSA’s and Pequiven’s supply contracts with
FertiNitro. Third, PYDSA Gas did not breach its supply obligations toward FertiNitro.
Fourth, the Claimants’ exclusion of 2009 and 2010 from the valuation is contrary to the

basic assumption of DCF valuation methodology. Fifth, the existence of the Treaty does

as a cause for the Plant’s historically high rate of unplanned shutdowns. (See Jacobs Consultancy Report, Deferred
Second Reliability Test Report FertiNitro Complex, Jose Venezuela Reasons for Non-certification (October 2006)
(R-57)).

not justify excluding the 2009-2010 data. Sixth, the Respondent is not responsible for
FertiNitro’s operational difficulties in 2009-2010 which were primarily the result of

original construction defects.**!

The third matter invoked by the Respondent (in support of its contention that Mr Giles’

valuation is flawed) is the Claimants’ understated projections of FertiNitro’s future costs.

In this regard, the Respondent points to the Claimants’ unreasonable reliance on budgeted,
instead of actual, turnaround and maintenance costs. In contrast, the Respondent contends
that Dr Flores’ use of FertiNitro’s actual cost data, as available on the valuation date, makes
sense, since such actual data properly reflects the state of the Plant and its operating
conditions in Venezuela. The Respondent also characterizes his approach as being
justifiable, since such data appropriately reflects the state of the Plant and the operating
conditions in Venezuela. Rejecting the Claimants’ allegations which, so the Respondent
contends, seek to attribute blame to the Respondent for the increased costs, the Respondent
submits that these allegations distract from the fact that it is the Claimants who have failed
to discharge their burden of proving that they can legitimately ignore FertiNitro’s actual

costs (and thus deviate from standard valuation practice) and can instead use budgeted data.

The Respondent points to the reason for these costs, being the need for increased
maintenance and turnaround costs arising from the early aging of machinery and
equipment.°*? Contrary to the Claimants’ allegations, these initial construction defects
were not largely resolved by the Major Maintenance Plan (“MMP”) in 2005, as
Mr Villarroel’s oral evidence proved.*** Moreover, the Respondent contends that the Plant
suffered from an above-average number of unplanned shutdowns.**+ Further, the damage

suffered from unplanned shutdowns was often magnified by the absence, or

malfunctioning, of standard protective systems that automatically take control of

operations when power outages occur and that shield the main equipment from damage.**>

The Respondent also points to the increasing inflation rates in Venezuela that resulted in
increased costs in local currency, which (so it contends) the Claimants have ignored.**°
The Respondent also contends that increasing inflation also significantly impacted
FertiNitro’s turnaround costs. In fact, between 2007, when FertiNitro’s second major
turnaround was budgeted, and 2008, when such turnaround took place, Venezuelan annual
inflation increased by as much as 11.7 percentage points, going from 18.7% to 30.4%.°*”
Rising inflation inevitably led to a sharp increase in turnaround costs, since turnarounds

require the use of hundreds of external local workers, who are paid in Bolivars.

Turning to Mr Giles’ expert evidence, the Respondent contends that Mr Giles is wrong to
allege that FertiNitro’s exposure to domestic inflation is “extremely low” since only “a
very small proportion of its costs are denominated in bolivars.”°** The Respondent
characterises this as a “[h]ighly simplistic assessment of the plant’s local costs [...] based
on an opportunistic choice of cost data (using, e.g., the 2008 budgeted turnaround costs,
rather than the much higher actual costs) and is limited to the period 2006-2008 (thus
precisely excluding the years in which inflation skyrocketed).”**? The Claimants’
contention that inflation is a “new purported explanation” for FertiNitro’s higher than

budgeted costs should, so the Respondent contends, be rejected by the Tribunal.*”

Next, the Respondent points to the fact that the high maintenance and turnaround costs are
not primarily due to operational mistakes in recent years. Rather, in reliance on various

reports*”! (all of which the Respondent contends show that the processes at the Plant were

“breakdown in the organization structure”*’? after KOMSA’s exit from the Plant’s

acknowledgement that there had been a frequent change in managerial staff at FertiNitro
even in the Plant’s early years.*°? The Respondent concludes that the processes were not

ideal from the outset.5°*

9.155 As to the Claimants’ understated projections of FertiNitro’s future costs, the Respondent
points to the understatement of other costs, describing them as not only “clearly
understated” but also “highly speculative.”*?> With respect to capital expenditures, after
not considering them at all in his first report, Mr Giles projects an amount of US$ 10 million
in his second report, based on Mr Sanders’ suggestion.*”° But the Respondent points to the
fact that neither Mr Sanders, nor Mr Giles, explain this amount. Indeed, Mr Sanders
ultimately admitted on cross examination that “[d]Jepending on what [...] new pieces of
equipment have to be installed” it is “certainly” possible that FertiNitro would require more

capital expenditure than the US$ 10 million benchmark he provided, based on his

experience at the Terra OK plant.*””

9.156 With respect to gas costs, Mr Giles based his projection of the base price for natural gas on
a single data point: FertiNitro’s budgeted natural gas price for 2010, which, the Respondent

emphasises, is the lowest base price for all the budget years that he reviewed.*°* Mr Giles’

respected forecasters. Dr Flores’ forecast, based upon three such long-term forecasters,

should be preferred by the Tribunal.°°

Fourth, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ proposed discount rate of 10.12% is
understated, whereas Dr Flores’ proposed rate of 20.37% is fully justified. It contends that

Mr Giles’ discount calculations are unreasonable in at least the following respects, namely:

Mr Giles inappropriately uses global market risk premium data. The market premium is
intended to measure the additional return over the risk-free rate required by equity investors
in the USA. (This market risk reflects risks unrelated to Venezuela.) Mr Giles calculates
arate of 4.75% relying on global market risk estimates published in 2006 (that is, four
years before the mandatory acquisition). Mr Giles’ market rate is inappropriate because
the data he relies on is out-dated and the use of global market risk estimates is incompatible

with Mr Giles’ additive method of calculating the discount rate.

Under the additive method, the valuation expert must (as Dr Flores has) calculate the
elements of the discount rate, including the market risk rate, as if they applied to a company
based in the USA and then apply a country risk premium reflecting the additional risks of
operating in any other country, here Venezuela.©! Hence, Mr Giles should have used USA
market risk data instead of global data. Further, the Fernandez Paper (on which Mr Giles

relies) contradicts his very own market risk rate.

Mr Giles improperly relies on limited survey data to establish Venezuela’s country risk
premium. In this regard, the Respondent points to the fact that Dr Flores calculated a
country-risk rate of 11.26% based on the average of three well-recognised methods: (i)
Morningstar/Ibbotson’s country-spread model (12.75%); (ii) Ibbotson/Morningstar’s
country risk rating model (14.27%); and (iii) Professor Damodaran’s estimate (6.75%).

According to the Respondent, Dr Flores did not apply other recognised models, such as JP

© Flores ER2, Paragraph 55.
1 Flores ER2, Paragraph 106.
02 Flores ERI, Figure 11.

234

Morgan’s Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI), which would have resulted in a

comparatively higher country risk premium for Venezuela of 12.41%.

9.161 The Respondent contends that Mr Giles’ reliance on a survey (rather than established
premium risk models), such survey suggesting a country risk premium for Venezuela of
5.5%, is entirely unfounded. Again, the Respondent points to Mr Giles’ own evidence that

the survey cannot be considered representative.

Further, it points to the fact that the
Tbbotson/Morningstar country spread model is identified by the survey itself as the primary
and preferred source among survey participants for determining country risk.°* The
Respondent also contends that Mr Giles’ reliance on the survey is inappropriate since he
has not made any adjustments for potential bias arising from the fact most survey
participants assessed country risk for their own countries, with respect to which they were
naturally not neutral, and the authors themselves have no methodology to correct for this

type of bias in the survey.

9.162 Mr Giles arbitrarily excludes political risk from his country risk rate. The Respondent

contends that, without giving any economic justification, Mr Giles excluded “many of the

79605 «6,

risks normally associated with the concept of country risk (e.g., expropriation), ‘where

606

[he was] instructed that the Treaty offers potential protection. The Respondent

contends that this approach is unreasonable and contrary to recent ICSID decisions,
including the award in ExxonMobil where the tribunal held that “the confiscation risk
remains part of the country risk and must be taken into account in the determination of the

discount rate.”’ The tribunal there decided that:

“[I]t is precisely at the time before an expropriation (or the public knowledge of an
impending expropriation) that the risk of a potential expropriation would exist, and

this hypothetical buyer would take it into account when determining the amount he
would be willing to pay in that moment.”°°*

The Respondent contends that the risks of expropriation or nationalisation were
clearly known from the outset, since they were specifically addressed in the 1998
Offering Circular. Further, contrary to the Claimants’ approach that BITs lower
exposure to country risk (an approach described by the Claimants as “trite” )®' the
Respondent contends that investors generally do not perceive BITs to lower country
risk,°"' nor is there any basis for the Claimants’ speculation that “surely a buyer
would be expected to have BIT protection in a hypothetical arm’s length

transaction” 6!

9.163 Mr Giles applies an unreasonable /ambda factor. The Respondent contends that it is based
on “pure speculation”.°'? The Respondent relies upon Dr Flores’ evidence, in which it says
that he has considered FertiNitro’s exposure to Venezuelan country risk, but (in contrast to
Mr Giles) he has concluded that it is not justified to deviate from the standard lambda factor
of 1 since, in order to do so, “we need to have very convincing evidence that it is really
lower than the average and not higher”.°!* Dr Flores says that no such evidence exists. The
Respondent characterises Mr Giles’ risk assessment as “entirely vague, inaccurate and

unbalanced”,°!> citing four factors, as listed below.

9.164 First, the Respondent points to the fact that Mr Giles has not provided any calculations or
methodology to explain how he arrived at a risk exposure of 40%. It says that, while Mr
Giles has identified 22 risk factors, he has failed to explain their relative importance.°'°

protected by the Treaty has no economic justification but is based, instead, on the

instruction of the Claimants’ counsel.°!”

Second, the Respondent says that Mr Giles has underestimated FertiNitro’s risk exposure,
including risk factors that are entirely unrelated to expropriation risk. For example, the
Respondent rejects Mr Giles’ evidence that FertiNitro be ranked as “low” for all six risk
factors associated with social disorder.°!® Mr Giles makes this ranking because he believes
that “it is easy to see how the strategic location of the FertiNitro Plant in a secure industrial
complex on the coast would be less risky than a plant located in central Caracas when
considering the potential effects of social unrest.”°!? However, Dr Flores points to the facts
that the Plant is located in an unsafe area, and that while no FertiNitro personnel live at the
Plant, social unrest in nearby communities will directly affect FertiNitro since that is where
managers and workers commute to and from the Plant. He concludes, on the basis of safety
alone that, “if you tell an investor, you can make a dollar of profit investing in a fertilizer
plant in Wichita or investing in a fertilizer plant in the José Complex, I think that one dollar
in the José Complex would be heavily discounted.”®° Further, due to having all of its
production facilities in Venezuela, FertiNitro was inevitably heavily exposed to

Venezuelan country risk, despite it receiving most of its revenue from abroad.

Third, the Respondent points to that the fact that Mr Giles has ignored risk factors that
increase FertiNitro’s exposure to Venezuelan country risk, including FertiNitro’s
dependence on a single supplier for natural gas and the fact that, while smaller companies
in Venezuela are exempted from certain taxes, as a large company in the formal sector of
the economy FertiNitro is exposed to the full range of taxes and hence faces greater risks

in the event of tax increases.

Fourth, the Respondent contends that common sense also speaks against Mr Giles’ 0.4

lambda factor, which results in an alleged country risk rate for FertiNitro of only 2%. That

rate corresponds to the rate normally applied to investments in such countries as, for

example, Italy.©*!

However, as the Respondent poses the question, if you had one dollar
to invest would you really be indifferent to investing it in Venezuela or in Italy for the same

expected return?

Mr Giles deducts a 1% liquidity discount from his country risk rate, which the Respondent
contends finds no support in standard valuation practice. Dr Flores explained that he has
“never seen an expert do what Mr Giles has done here”. Indeed, the Respondent contends
that Mr Giles’ application of a liquidity discount on the country risk rate is based on a
misguided interpretation of the market value standard provided in CMS v. Argentina, which

calls for “an open and unrestricted market.”°

However, the requirement of an “open and unrestricted market” does not allow excluding
de facto restrictions on the sale of the relevant asset that would have existed even
irrespective of the disputed acts; and it does not permit the valuation expert to create a
world where KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro is worth more than it would be in the absence
of the disputed acts. Further, the Respondent contends that Mr Giles’ valuation, and his
application of a liquidity discount, ignores the fact that KOMSA’s equity in FertiNitro is a

minority stake in a closely-held company in a small, developing market.

Further, and moving beyond the flaws in the rate itself, the Respondent contends that the
unreasonableness of the Claimants’ discount rate is confirmed by the awards in the
ExxonMobil and Mobil cases® and the award in Flughafen v. Venezuela.°* The
Respondent points to these three awards, all of which applied discount rates similar to those

625

proposed by Dr Giles, namely 18% in the case of the ExxonMobil and Mobil awards°~ and

22 CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/O1/8, Award (12 May 2005) (“CMS
v. Argentina”) (CLA-130), Paragraph 402. Further, the Respondent contends that the requirement that the market
be “open and unrestricted” is not a standard element of FMV definitions. For example, it points to Occidental
Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador, 1\CSID
Case No ARB/06/11, Award (5 October 2012) (“Occidental v. Ecuador”) (CLA-129), where the FMV definition
(cited by the Claimants on Slide 24 of their Opening Statement on Quantum) does not contain this element.

a nominal discount rate of 17.28% in the case of the Flughafen award.©° In addition, as
the ICSID tribunal in ExxonMobil stated, “[o]ther arbitral tribunals [...] in circumstances

comparable to the present case [...] have used rates ranging from 18.5% to 21%.”°”

The Respondent then makes submissions on Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, 628

noting that a
comparatively lower discount rate than the ExxonMobil tribunal was there applied. It
explains that “it is not appropriate to increase the country risk premium to reflect the
market’s perception that a State might have a propensity to expropriate investments in
breach of BIT obligations.”®? In any event, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal
should not view the Gold Reserve award as relevant to the present case since that award
concerns a project that has hardly anything in common with the FertiNitro project. The
ExxonMobil project, in contrast, is very comparable, or even identical, to the FertiNitro
project.©° Due to the similarities of FertiNitro to the project valued in the ExxonMobil and
Mobil awards (and the absence of such similarities with respect to the Gold Reserve
project), the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should look to the ExxonMobil and

Mobil decisions in determining the reasonableness of the experts’ discount rates.

In contrast to Mr Giles’ evidence, the Respondent contends that Dr Flores’ approach is
straightforward. It points to the fact that, in calculating his discount rate, he consulted the
most broadly-accepted sources and applied them in an objective manner. It submits that

Dr Flores’ approach is certainly not arbitrary, nor “merely a tool that Dr Flores uses to

26 Flughafen v. Venezuela (RLA-154), Paragraph 839. The Respondent notes that the tribunal in Flughafen ultimately
did not apply a nominal discount rate of 17.28%, but a discount rate in real terms of 14.4% (i.e. not counting
inflation) to be consistent with the cash flow projections which (in contrast to the present case) were also conducted
in real terms.

630 In this regard, the Respondent relied on the similarity demonstrated by the following common key aspects:
(a) production facilities located in the José Complex; (b) production primarily for export; (c) revenues primarily
in US dollars; (d) use of an offtake agreement; (e) project started during “Apertura” period; (f) use of bond offering
memorandum from 1998; (g) use of project financing; and (h) the existence of multiple shareholders, including
PDVSA.

depress the valuation of the Claimants’ investments substantially; rather, it reflects

standard valuation practice.

Next, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ alleged “reasonableness checks” do not
support their valuation of KOMSA’s 25% share in FertiNitro. In this regard, the

Respondent makes four principal submissions.

First, the Respondent contends that the October 2008 MOU price, if properly adjusted,
confirms Dr Flores’ valuation, not Mr Giles’ valuation. That is, the October 2008 MOU
price (US$ 212.5 million) for KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro, if properly adjusted for
purposes of a FMV valuation as at 30 September 2010 (to US$ 55.3 million), supports the
Respondent’s valuation. Since the value of the Plant depends on its future cash flows, any
valuation that relies on earlier value determinations in this regard must be adjusted to
account for changes in the price of the goods sold, here ammonia and urea. Thus, the
Plant’s value in September 2010 cannot be the same as in October 2008, when prices and

price projections were significantly higher.

Second, the Respondent contends that the construction costs of other plants are irrelevant.
More specifically, the construction costs of the Moron plant are irrelevant for the valuation
of FertiNitro, since these costs say nothing about the value of the FertiNitro Plant. The
same is true for the projected construction costs of the Guiria and José plants, which the
Claimants raised at the Second (November) Hearing.® In fact, due to construction delays
or market changes, the value of a construction is not infrequently less than what it cost the

owner to build.°*

Third, the Respondent contends that the two Advantis reports confirm Dr Flores’ valuation.
At the same time, they show that Mr Giles’ valuation of KOMSA’s Equity Valuation at
US$ 361 million is clearly overstated. The First Advantis valuation, prepared in the

context of settlement negotiations, valued KOMSA’s 25% interest at

US$ 30-48 million (or US$ 120-194 million for 100%), assuming the Urea Decree
continued to apply, and at US$ 99 million (or US$ 398 million for 100%), in the event that

domestic Urea Decree sales ended in 2012.4

The second Advantis report calculated a higher value of US$ 113 million for KOMSA’s
25% interest in FertiNitro (or US$ 452 million for 100%) in the event the Urea Decree
sales ended in 2012. However, under the assumption that domestic Urea Decree sales
would continue (and assuming the same impact as in the First Advantis Valuation), Dr
Flores has shown that the second Advantis Valuation decreases to US$ 43.5-62 million

(KOMSA’s 25% share) or US$ 248-174 million (100% of FertiNitro).°*°

It follows, so the Respondent contends, that Dr Flores’ valuation of KOMSA’s interest at
US$ 34.6-64.3 million is within the range of, or at least close to, the outcomes of the two
Advantis valuations in the range of US$ 30-113 million, whereas Mr Giles’ valuation of
US$ 361 million is a clear outlier and exceeds the Advantis valuations by approximately
three to ten times. Further, Mr Giles makes the new argument that the applicable discount
rate would be 13.1%, using Advantis’ market risk premium and country risk premium
(which are lower than Dr Flores’ respective assumptions), together with Dr Flores’ risk
free rate and beta (which, in turn, are respectively lower than those used in the Advantis
reports). The Respondent contends that this arbitrary and unexplained approach makes no
sense, describing it as “yet another example of Mr Giles’ inappropriate cherry-picking
approach that considers only those elements that increase his valuation, while excluding

elements that decrease his valuation.”°*°

Fourth, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ new argument based on FertiNitro’s
book value is irrelevant. The Respondent contends that, at the Second (November)
Hearing, the Claimants raised the new argument that Dr Flores’ valuation of KOMSA’s

share in FertiNitro at US$ 34.6 million is understated since the book value of KOMSA’s

25% of FertiNitro in 2010 allegedly was US$ 168.1 million.©°” However, the book value
is irrelevant when valuing a company based on the FMV standard. Indeed, the Respondent
points to what the Tribunal queried at the Hearing, namely that “the willingness of the
seller to sell is not necessarily connected in any causal or existential way with the ‘value’,

understood as an objective factor, of the assets that were taken.”

(iv) KNI’s Valuation of its Interest in the Offtake Agreement Claim is Overstated

The Respondent contends primarily that KNI’s contractual rights under the Offtake
Agreement are not an “investment” and/or that there has been no expropriation of such
rights so that no compensation is therefore due to KNI. The Tribunal has however decided
otherwise the issue of jurisdiction and the majority of the Tribunal as regards liability: see
above. In these circumstances, the Respondent here contends that the Tribunal should
determine such compensation based on Dr Flores’ valuation of US$ 56.2 million and not
based on Mr Giles’ overstated valuation of US$ 206.5 million. Neither Dr Flores nor the
Respondent contend that, assuming jurisdiction and liability decided in favour of KNI, that

KNI has suffered no loss at all from its expropriated interest in the Offtake Agreement.

First, the Respondent contends that the Claimants make the same inappropriate
assumptions regarding sales volumes and the discount rates as in their valuation of

KOSMA’s interest in FertiNitro.

Second, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ valuation period improperly includes
a sixteen-month period during which KNI suffered no losses. It says that the valuation of
KNI’s rights under the Offtake Agreement must necessarily, for reasons of both law and
fact, exclude the volumes of production that KNI obtained between October 2010 and
February 2012 under the Offtake Agreement. This is so because (so the Respondent
contends) it is undisputed between the Parties that KNI continued purchasing fertilizer
product from FertiNitro at Offtake Agreement prices during those sixteen months. The

Respondent points to the fact that Mr Giles performs his valuation as if these purchases

©7 Resp. PHB, Paragraph 253, referring to Second (November) Hearing D5.24 (Fietta).
©8 Second (November) Hearing D5.36 (Feliciano).

242

never happened and hence calculates damages for production volumes that KNI never lost.
Such double-compensation must be rejected irrespective of which valuation method is
applied. In contrast, the Respondent submits that Dr Flores looks at “what actually
happened” and accordingly excludes KNI’s purchases during October 2010 to February

2012 from his valuation.

9.183 Third, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ valuation is based on unrealistic factual

assumptions, namely:

(a) The Claimants inappropriately calculate KNI’s lost profits rather than the value of

KNI’s alleged rights under the Offtake Agreement;

(b) the Claimants fail to prove that they would never have been able to replace the

FertiNitro Offtake through purchases on the open market; and
(c) the Claimants’ lost profits calculations are flawed and highly speculative.

9.184 As to (a), Mr Giles calculates KNI’s lost profits, rather than the value of KNI’s alleged
rights under the Offtake Agreement. He further assumes that, following the termination of
the Offtake Agreement, KNI could then and forever replace its Offtake Agreement
quantities only through purchases at NOLA and TAMPA prices, thus losing any and all
opportunities to resell ammonia and urea replacement quantities at a profit. The
Respondent contends, however, that Dr Flores properly calculates the value of KNI’s
alleged rights under the Offtake Agreement as the difference between the mid-Caribbean
price for ammonia and urea on the open market, on the one hand, and the more favourable
Offtake Agreement Price (namely, low Caribbean price minus 3% urea or 4% ammonia
discount), on the other hand. The Respondent says that the Claimants’ attempt to dispute
the existence and credibility of a mid-Caribbean price is “astonishing”,®*? since it was their

own expert witness (Mr Giles) who first discussed this price in his first expert report.™°

© Giles ER1, Paragraphs 4.14-4.15; D.3.

243

9.185 As to (b), the Respondent says that developments in the USA and global fertilizer markets
known before the valuation date indicate that KNI would have been, and in fact likely was,
able to procure ammonia and urea replacement quantities at below NOLA/TAMPA costs.
As a consequence of the substantial increase in the USA’s domestic supply of inexpensive
natural gas (which is the key component of both ammonia and urea) since early 2008,
according to the Claimants’ own sources, both domestic and foreign companies have
started new fertilizer plants, or reactivated plants mothballed earlier, in the USA. This
development results in an increase of both USA and global supply of fertilizer product, as
well as a decrease of USA demand for imported (Caribbean) fertilizer, and elsewhere.
Indeed, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have recognised the new benefits of

producing fertilizer product in the USA.™!

9.186 In this regard, the Respondent contends that USA and international sources expect that new
investments into the USA fertilizer industry will result in between 3 to 7 million tons of
additional nitrogen fertilizer capacity in the USA.“4?. The Respondent submits that the
significant increase in the USA’s domestic fertilizer supply has already begun to impact
USA import demand. It follows, so the Respondent says, that, since the USA was the major
importer of Caribbean fertilizer product, a decrease in US importation will result in more
Caribbean product being available for purchase in the Caribbean. The Respondent points,
amongst other matters, to a report that Trinidad will be “worst affected among them all”
by an overall decrease of US import needs. Further, the Respondent contends that the
data it provided regarding the impact of the US shale gas revolution on the global fertilizer
markets is reliable. Finally, Mr Sorlie testified that there is an opportunity to buy ammonia
and urea spot tons on the Caribbean market.“ Even if such opportunity were limited, the
Respondent contends that this would contradict the Claimants’ allegations that they were

not able (now and forever) to replace any of the FertiNitro offtake quantities at Caribbean

open market prices. It follows, so the Respondent submits, that the Claimants, who carry

the burden of proof, have failed to provide the required evidence to discharge that burden.

Third, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ lost profits calculations are “flawed
and highly speculative”.> In this regard, the Respondent points to the fact that the
Claimants simply assume that KNI would have been able to export to the USA the same
amounts of fertilizer product at the same prices as in the past. However, the Respondent
submits that this entirely ignores the important changes in the USA fertilizer market, which
suggest that the USA’s demand for foreign fertilizer product will further decrease and
NOLA/TAMPA prices will decline, resulting in reduced profit margins and reduced sales
volumes for KNI over the years. It points to Mr Giles’ acknowledgement of “the drastically
increased gas reserves in the US and the resulting reduction in price and demand for
imported LNG in the US.”*° The same as with respect to LNG holds true with respect to

ammonia and urea.

Further, the Respondent contends that Mr Giles’ lost profits calculations are unreliable
since the shipping costs he accounts for are highly speculative. Mr Sorlie’s evidence that
Mr Giles’ cost estimate is reasonable cannot be relied upon, as he relied only on invoices
for two years (2009 and 2010), which is clearly too short a period for any proper
assessment.” Instead, as Dr Flores explained, “in the shipping industry, as commodity
prices rose, 2006, 2007 and 2008, shipping costs also increased dramatically, and then they
fell a lot in 2009 and 2010. I find it a little bit suspicious that they have only given us a
little bit of data for 2010, just one number that they say they have calculated internally for
2009, and no data whatsoever for 2007/2008”. In addition, Mr Giles’ calculation of
shipping costs is also said to be “sloppy”, as he has incorrectly used shipment data to Taft,
Louisiana, rather than Tampa, Florida, to calculate cost of transporting ammonia from José

to Tampa.

Finally, the Respondent contends that Mr Giles ignores any costs associated with the
business, such as overhead costs. The Claimants’ allegation that overhead costs were

immaterial to their cost calculations remains unproven.

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decisions
Principal Issues: Having regard to the submissions of the Parties’ summarised above, there
are, in relation to the question of compensation under Article 6 of the Treaty, three principal

issues that arise for the Tribunal’s determination, namely:

Issue (1): What is the appropriate standard of compensation for unlawful expropriation

under Article 6 of the Treaty?

Issue (2): What is the compensation payable to KOMSA in respect of its expropriated

interest in FertiNitro?

Issue (3): What is the compensation payable to KNI in respect of its expropriated

interest in the Offtake Agreement?

Each of these issues raises many sub-issues, the nature of which is plain from the Parties’
extensive written and oral submissions, summarised above. Those sub-issues will be

addressed to the extent appropriate below, as part of the three principal issues.

Issue (1): What is the Appropriate Standard of Compensation?

The Tribunal begins with Article 9(3) of the Treaty. It requires the Tribunal to limit itself
to awarding compensation for damages payable by the Respondent to KOMSA or KNI
where the Tribunal has determined that the Respondent has failed to comply with an
obligation under the Treaty. As to such compensation for a failure to comply with Article
6 of the Treaty, that provision refers, for a lawful expropriation, to “effective and adequate
compensation” that “shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated
immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became public knowledge,
whichever is the earlier.” Ostensibly, all Parties agree that such a market value, or fair
market value (FMV), is the appropriate standard of compensation to be applied to both
KOMSA’s and KNI’s claims for compensation against the Respondent (see the summaries

of the Parties’ respective submissions above).

246

9.193

9.194

9.195

In the circumstances of this case, for both KOMSA and KNI, that date for such valuation
is 10 October 2010 immediately prior to the Expropriation Decree and the responsible
Minister’s public statements (which are to be treated as one composite event) on the 11 of
October 2010. The Parties have used the date of 30 September 2010. For the Tribunal, the
difference is not material for the purpose of this Award. The date of 10 October 2010 or
30 September 2010 (as used by the Parties) is the relevant date for assessing compensation
due to KOMSA and KNI, without the benefit of hindsight based on subsequent factors.
The Tribunal has taken cognisance of the unresolved debate in other arbitrations as to
whether and, if so, to what extent, factors subsequent to unlawful expropriation (in its
different forms) up to the date of the award may be relevant to the assessment of
compensation, particularly the decisions in Quiborax v. Bolivia and Burlington v.
Ecuador. It need not enter that debate here, given the express terms of the Treaty as

applied by the Parties.

In this case, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide upon any difference between an
unlawful expropriation in breach of Article 6 of the Treaty and an expropriation under
Article 6 that would not be unlawful if the Contracting Party had made provisions “for
effective and adequate compensation”. Whilst other tribunals have laboured in deciding
this controversial question under international law and treaty wording, the Parties have here
agreed that, whatever the correct answer may be, the relevant compensation to KOMSA
and KNI should be based on the fair market value of the expropriated investment as at the
relevant date absent, or “but for”, any violations of the Treaty by the Respondent (the
“FMV standard”). Thus, the answer for unlawful expropriation is the same as for lawful
expropriation, under Article 6 of the Treaty. Thus, here, compensation to KOMSA and to
KNI should be based on the same FMV.

For their respective methodologies, as quantum experts, both Mr Giles (for the Claimants)

and Dr Flores (for the Respondent) refer to a fair market value (FMV), as being the value

at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would exchange an asset in cash, acting at
arms’ length in an open and unrestricted market when both have reasonable knowledge of

the relevant facts.

Accordingly, this FMV standard, as thus formulated, is common ground between the
Parties and their quantum experts as the methodology for compensation for this case.°°
The Parties’ approach is consistent with decisions on quantum methodology, such as CMS
v. Argentina and Occidental v. Ecuador.®! In the circumstances, the Tribunal is content

to adopt the Parties’ common approach for both KOMSA and (by a majority) KNI.

However, in calculating the FMV for KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro, the Parties’ two
expert witnesses, Mr Giles and Dr Flores, applied methodologies producing starkly
different results, as to which the Tribunal has experienced reservations, as explained below.
In calculating the FMV of KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement, the same two expert
witnesses have also employed different assumptions, with Mr Giles calculating lost profits
from 2010 onwards (essentially calculating Tampa/Nola resale prices less Offtake
Agreement price less transportation costs); and with Dr Flores excluding the period before
28 February 2012 (essentially calculating price differentials with the open Caribbean

market).

Issue (2): What Compensation is Payable to KOMSA in Respect of Its Expropriated
Interest In Fertinitro?
In their respective FMV calculations, as summarised above, the Parties’ expert witnesses
differ significantly, in particular, as to applicable discount rates and FertiNitro’s production

and costs. The Tribunal refers to these experts’ points of disagreement in Table 2 above.

As to discount rates, Dr Flores and the Respondent advance a greater market risk rate,
country risk rate, lambda, “BIT Risks” and liquidity adjustment. As to the FertiNitro
Plant’s production and costs, Dr Flores and the Respondent invoke existing defects in the

construction of the FertiNitro Plant, poor maintenance in the Plant’s early years of

operation, excessive unplanned shutdowns of the Plant, high costs of maintenance owing
to the Plant’s defective history and condition; problems with the supply of gas and

electricity to the Plant; and Venezuela’s generally adverse economic situation.

The Respondent also accuses Mr Giles of cherry-picking data, in particular as to costs of
natural gas, turnarounds, maintenance, capital expenditure and, as to production data, the
exclusion of the years 2009 and 2010. The Respondent rejects Mr Giles’ reasonableness
checks as to the MOU of October 2008, the construction costs of other plants elsewhere

and the book value of FertiNitro.

As to discount rates, Mr Giles uses different inputs. As market risk, he uses an “adjusted”
historical premium which, with other differences, results in a total discount rate of 10.1%,
in contrast to Dr Flores’ rate of 20.4%. As regards figures for production and costs, Mr
Giles used actual values but, where these were thought by him to be unreliable, budgeted
figures (particularly for 2008, 2009 and 2010). Mr Giles was clearly troubled by the Plant’s

historically high level of actual turnaround and maintenance costs.

As to sanity checks, Mr Giles used a book value for FertiNitro’s assets, calculating
KOMSA’s 25% interest at US$ 168.1 million (but also recognising that a book value of
assets alone does not value FertiNitro as a going concern). As to FertiNitro’s historical
construction costs, these equated to US$ 273 million for KOMSA (at 2001 prices). As to
the MOU valuations in 2008 for KOMSA’s 25% interest, Mr Giles adjusted these figures
to exclude the impact of the Urea Decree and reversed the effect of FertiNitro’s new and

increased taxes, arriving at a figure of US$ 360.8 million.

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no cogent evidence that any MOU price was actually
“agreed” in 2007 or 2008 between Pequiven and KOMSA. The first offer came via an
email message of 9 October 2007 from Mr Toro of Pequiven with a valuation of
US$ 1.175 billion for 100% of the equity of FertiNitro, less the amount outstanding to its
banks and bondholders (which he put at US$ 450,000, presumably US$ 450 million).°?
On7 November 2007, KOMSA responded with its draft MOU and a valuation of US$1.210

billion less the debts to the banks and bondholders plus the excess cash in FertiNitro.?
Discussions were halted between these parties in early 2008. However, Pequiven came
back again in October 2008 with a revised draft MOU which provided for a payment of
US$ 212.5 million to KOMSA for its share of FertiNitro’s equity. Ultimately, no MOU
or valuation was ever agreed or signed between KOMSA and Pequiven. Pequiven declared
that the purchase of the private shareholders’ shares in FertiNitro was no longer a priority.
However, Mr Parra (of KOMSA) testified in his witness statement (paragraph 69) that
KOMSA’s representatives understood that there was “no real alternative but to accept
Pequiven’s proposal.” In these circumstances, the only figure equating to any “agreed”
valuation was the sum of US$ 212.5 million proposed by Pequiven to KOMSA in October
2008 (which maintained the Urea Decree and the various taxes). As indicated, however,

this figure was never in fact agreed between KOMSA and Pequiven or the Respondent.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal attaches no weight to these incomplete negotiations in
2007 and 2008 for the purpose of arriving at the appropriate FMV much later in
September/October 2010.

More significantly, by the required valuation date of 10 October 2010 (or 30 September
2010) under Article 6 of the Treaty, the FertiNitro Plant was not what it had been in 2007
and 2008. It was in a distressed condition operated by a troubled company with a divided
board of directors, within a deteriorating national economy. It was also badly run, poorly
maintained, mismanaged and with costs “spiralling out of control” in the words of its board
of directors on 5 August 2010. There were by now high inflation rates in Venezuela; and,
with the devaluation of Venezuelan currency, its US$ denominated costs had increased
significantly (albeit to an extent reducing local costs). There was also growing industrial
and social unrest impacting adversely upon the operation of the FertiNitro Plant, as Mr

Gwaltney testified.® The Tribunal does not therefore consider FetiNitro’s state on 10

October 2010 to be comparable to its earlier state in 2007-2008, thereby making earlier
data materially irrelevant, including historical construction costs, higher production levels

and (as already decided above) the 2007 or 2008 draft MOU valuations.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider that either expert witness, for all their
obvious professional skill and industry, has succeeded in establishing a reliable fair market
value of KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro. Overall, the experts’ differences can be mostly
attributed to wide-ranging disagreements as to the relevance and scope of factual inferences
and factual assumptions. The Tribunal has summarised their approach at length above,
from which it can be seen that each severely criticises the other’s analysis and conclusions.
Whilst insufficient to establish on firm ground their own approach, parts of that criticism
suffice to destroy the Tribunal’s confidence in the other’s approach as an expert witness on
quantum. It is as if two boxers in the ring knocked each other out simultaneously, with

neither winning the contest.

The Tribunal therefore turns to the two Advantis reports, particularly its second report of
July 2011, which contains two scenarios. The first scenario appears to be a mere revision
of the first report of May 2011, as no explanation is given for the figure of US$ 113 million
as the value of KOMSA’s 25% interest in FertiNitro.°’ Using a DCF methodology to
arrive at a FMV and taking into account several factors not considered in the first report
this “second scenario” valued KOMSA’s 25% interest in FertiNitro at US$ 140.25 million
(being 25% of a total value of US$ 561 million) as at September 2010, based only upon
data available up to 2010. Neither KOMSA nor the Respondent accept any of Advantis’
valuations; but the Parties and the Parties’ quantum expert witnesses (Mr Giles and Dr

Flores) referred to the Advantis reports on numerous occasions for different purposes.

The Advantis reports take the form of Power Point presentations, prepared in the Spanish
language. Although in part laconic, possibly incomplete and with their authors not made

available to the Tribunal as witnesses in this arbitration, the Tribunal considers that these

9.212

reports suffice well for present purposes, particularly the “second scenario” in the second

report.

In its first report of May 2011, Advantis valued KOMSA’s interest as US$ 30-48.5 million
if the Urea Decree continued (on different scenarios), and as US$ 99.5 million if it ceased

at the end of 2012.8

In its second report of July 2011, Advantis valued KOMSA’s interest on two further
scenarios. Under a first scenario, calculated on a base value of US$ 452 million, Advantis
valued that interest at US$ 113 million. %? Under the second scenario, Advantis calculated
a base value for FertiNitro of US$ 561 million, adjusted from the base value of US$ 452
million to take account of six factors, including higher prices for ammonia and urea (some
of these other factors increasing and some decreasing the value of Fertinitro, resulting in a
net increase of US$ 109 million). This second scenario in Advantis’ second report valued

KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro as US$ 140.25 million, being 25% of US$ 561 million.°°

These six factors were: adjusted prices for ammonia and urea as set out in a separate
appendix for 2011 to 2016 (+ US$ 125 m); 10% as discounts for new investments as set
out in a separate appendix for 2011 to 2016 (+ US$ 4m); tax credits reducing the effective
income tax rate for 2007-2010 as set out in a separate appendix (+ US$ 35m); increased
depreciation (+ US$ 59m); adjusted exchange rates for PDVSA’s and Pequiven’s debts as
set out in a separate appendix (- US$ 41m); and adjusted inflation rates for income tax (-

US$ 68m). The Tribunal accepts these adjustments.

The first Advantis report was discussed with FertiNitro’s foreign shareholders. It was
received and studied by KOMSA at the time. Mr Gwaltney (for KOMSA) testified that
both Advantis Reports were provided to KOMSA by Pequiven and that the second report

followed his letter to Pequiven expressing criticisms of the first report.! It does not appear

from the evidence available to the Tribunal that KOMSA discussed the second report with

Pequiven or Advantis at the time.

9.213. The Tribunal has considered the different comments on the Advantis Reports made by the

Parties and their respective experts, Mr Giles and Dr Flores.

9.214 By reference to the two Advantis’ reports, Dr Flores valued KOMSA’s interest as
US$ 34.6 million if the Urea Decree continued, and at US$ 64.3 million if it ended in 2012.
As also submitted by the Respondent at the Third (June) Hearing:

“[...] the Advantis report is a better sanity check than the MoU prices, simply due to
the fact that it contains a valuation as of September 2010, which is the same time that
we are looking at for FertiNitro today and under the BIT. The Advantis valuations,
both of them — the first one in May 2011 and the second one in July 2011 — both
support that Dr Flores’s [sic] valuation of $34.6 million is a lot more reasonable
than Mr Giles’s valuation of $361 million. Here we are speaking about the 25% share
of KOMSA in FertiNitro.” 662.

and later

“Advantis only discussed the discount rate in the May 2011 valuation, not in the July
2011 valuation. However, since both of them refer to the value of FertiNitro as of
September 2010, it is reasonable to assume that Advantis used the same discount rate
in both of those reports. Advantis calculated the equity and market risk premium as
the average of the return on the S&P 500 over the risk-free rate in the previous ten
years. This is not a common estimation method. And when discussing, when thinking
about Advantis’s [sic] equity risk premium, it is important to understand that in
carrying out their calculation, Advantis uses a higher beta and a higher risk-free
rate, so overall that has an effect on its utility as a point of comparison. But it is more
meaningful to compare overall discount rates with those of Mr Giles and Dr Flores
than it is to look at any of the single components in isolation, as the Claimants have
done. You need to look at it as a whole to figure out whether it is reasonable, rather
than cherry-picking individual points from the Advantis report to try and make your
position.” °°

9.215 In contrast, Mr Giles (inter alia) valued KOMSA’s interest at US$ 361 million, with a

separate impact from the Urea Decree calculated as US$ 22.4 million. In its submissions,

3 Third (June) Hearing D1.280ff (Mr Ryan).

253

KOMSA compared Dr Flores’ calculations unfavourably with those made by Advantis, as
to market risk premium (3.5% v. 6.7%), generic country risk premium (7.6% v. 11.26%),
and the FertiNitro Plant’s daily production of ammonia (96% vs 91.3% of nameplate); and
production of urea (98% v. 90.8% of nameplate). KOMSA finds support in the Advantis
reports for Mr Giles’ approach; but it rejects the Advantis reports as a ‘sanity check’.

However, as eventually submitted by KOMSA at the Third (June) Hearing:

“The Advantis report [of July 2011] is not really usable as a sanity check. Advantis
was retained by Venezuela -- it wasn’t retained jointly, it wasn’t retained as an
independent consultant -- and therefore its work is not indicative of fair market value.
[...] There are some interesting features in Advantis that I think bear looking at. The
market risk premium that Advantis uses is significantly lower than Dr Flores, and
closer to Mr Giles. The generic risk premium, while being higher than Mr Giles’s
[sic] premium at 6%, is still materially lower and further away from Dr Flores. The
production levels here are quite high, much higher than Dr Flores: 96% nameplate
for Advantis, and 91.3% for Dr Flores, that’s for ammonia; and 98% on urea, 91%
for Dr Flores. This is quite telling because Advantis was retained by Venezuela to do
a valuation, and on many of these important criteria they have chosen values that are
much closer to Mr Giles’s [sic] independent valuation than they are to Dr Flores’s
[sic]. So I think that does bear looking at [...]”.

9.216 The Tribunal considers that it is inappropriate to cherry-pick different parts of the Advantis
Reports and thereby seek to adjust, one way or another, the several factors invoked by Mr
Giles and Dr Flores. This exercise would be difficult, if not impossible for the Tribunal,
as indeed each expert was criticised for doing so by the opposing Party. Moreover, it would
constitute, inevitably, a subjective and self-serving exercise. In the Tribunal’s view, the
Advantis reports must be accepted as they stand, with the Tribunal preferring to accept, as
a whole, the second scenario in the second Advantis report read with the remainder of the
Advantis reports. At the very least, it is fair to conclude that Pequiven would not have
submitted to the other shareholders the second Advantis report if it did not consider that it

was proposing a fair market value for FertiNitro.° Moreover, it is worth noting, as stated

4 Third (June) Hearing, D1.236-237 (Mr Beckett),
5 First (September) Hearing D3.86-87 (Barrientos).

254

9.217

9.218

9.219

by Mr Barrientos in his oral testimony, that “two of the shareholders accepted that valuation

and these were the shareholders with which we were able to reach a friendly settlement.”°

The Tribunal can state shortly the result of its analysis of the Parties’ respective
submissions, together with the expert testimony of their respective witnesses, Mr Giles and
Dr Flores. Both generally (as already indicated above) and ostensibly based on the
Advantis Reports, the Tribunal can place no reliance in such divergent testimony and
submissions, each producing such extreme and incompatible results based on materially
different data, inferences and assumptions. In brief, the Tribunal regards Dr Flores’
valuation as far too low; but it also regards Mr Giles’ valuation as too high. It has also
experienced difficulties in adopting at face value either expert’s methodologies when, with
only slight factual variations between them, the end-result can be skewed so radically one

way or the other.

The Tribunal therefore returns to the second scenario in Advantis’ second report of July
2011, as a contemporary, independent professional valuation (albeit by valuation experts
retained by Pequiven, in the absence of an agreement with the other shareholders on a joint
appointment of a valuator) calculated as at the relevant date without material hindsight. In
the Tribunal’s view, this second report’s second scenario provides the best available answer
to the issue under consideration under Article 6 of the Treaty, namely the (fair) market
value of KOMSA’s interest in FertiNitro immediately before its unlawful expropriation by

the Respondent on 11 October 2010.

At the Third (June) Hearing, the Tribunal did request the Parties for the software versions
of their experts’ calculations, in the form of an agreed interactive matrix, so as to attempt
to make its own inputs and test differing results.’ To the Tribunal’s regret, by joint email

messages dated 12 July 2016 the Parties declined this request as impracticable. In

costly endeavor.”).

255

9.222

particular, it has made it impossible for the Tribunal to test the experts’ respective

conclusions based on different factual assumptions.

As to sanity checks, the Tribunal acknowledges that its FMV approach based on this second
scenario leads to a significant reduction in KOMSA’s claim and Mr Giles’ valuation.
Conversely, it represents a very significant increase from Dr Flores’ valuation (US$
34.6m). The Tribunal has considered other reality checks invoked by the Parties; but it
considers none materially helpful. In particular, whilst Mr Giles’ book value of US$ 168.1
million might broadly support the Tribunal’s approach, the Tribunal recognises that such a
book value cannot correspond to the FMV of a going concern. Similarly, the Tribunal
accepts the Respondent’s criticisms of Mr Giles’ other reality checks, including

construction costs elsewhere.

Accordingly, in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty the Tribunal assesses, as best it can
on the available materials, that the fair market value of KOMSA’s 25% expropriated
interest in FertiNitro as at 10 October 2010 (or 30 September 2010) was US$ 140.25

million.

Issue (3): What, If Any, Compensation is Payable to KNI In Respect of Its Expropriated
Interest in The Offtake Agreement?

It is necessary to recall the basis on which this question arises. First, the Tribunal (by a
majority) has found the Respondent liable under Article 6 of the Treaty for the unlawful
indirect expropriation of KNI’s interest in the Offtake Agreement, as claimed by KNI.
KNI’s claim is a claim advanced exclusively under the Treaty, under the Treaty’s provision
for ICSID arbitration. It is not advanced as a contractual claim under KNI’s Offtake
Agreement with FertiNitro. The Respondent is not a party to the Offtake Agreement. The
Tribunal has no jurisdiction in regard to any contractual claim by KNI against FertiNitro
under the Offtake Agreement by itself. Indeed the Offtake Agreement contains its own
provisions for commercial arbitration and municipal (not international) law. Second, the
issue of liability under Article 6 is legally distinct from the issue of compensation for such
liability. Whilst the former derives from the latter, the issue of compensation is, of course,
materially different under the Treaty. Third, the Parties and their respective experts were

agreed that KNI’s loss was to be assessed by reference to the FMV of its interest in the

256

9.223

9.224

9.225

Offtake Agreement as at the relevant date required under the Treaty, namely 30 September
2010 (or 10 October 2010). None advocated for a contractual measure of damages; and,
significantly, Dr Flores’ did not arrive at a figure of zero compensation. Last but not least,
as a matter of procedural fairness to all Parties, it is necessary to limit the issues decided in
this Award to those raised by the Parties based on the legal submissions and evidential

materials made and adduced by them in this arbitration.

One major issue between the Parties relates to the exclusion or inclusion of KNI’s
purchases from the FertiNitro Plant during the period from 11 October 2010 to 28 February
2012. The other major differences are the Parties’ different assumptions regarding markets
prices, sales volumes from production from the FertiNitro Plant, discount rates and the
relevant cut-off date for ex-post factors. The Tribunal refers to the Parties’ expert
witnesses’ points of disagreement in Table 3 above. Their resulting differences are stark:
Mr Giles estimating KNI’s compensation as US$ 206.5 million; and Dr Flores as US$ 56.2

million.

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that Mr Giles’ expert testimony, as regards factual and
market assumptions, was significantly supported by the testimony of Mr Sorlie. Mr Sorlie
was an impressive witness; and the Tribunal found him reliable, both in his written
statement and as an oral witness. There was no equivalent rebuttal factual witness called
by the Respondent. Accordingly, whilst Mr Giles’ expert testimony was here supported
by the factual evidence, the same cannot be said as regards the expert testimony of Dr

Flores.

As to the issue of the period from October 2010 to February 2012, the Tribunal has found
in favour of KNI’s case, as decided in Part VII above, in regard to liability. As to the cut-
off date for factual assumptions, the Tribunal likewise decides against the Respondent’s
use of factors occurring after 10 October (or 30 September) 2010 derived only with the
benefit of hindsight, particularly in regard to recent developments of shale gas production
in the USA, the increased supply of ammonia and urea in the world market and differential
shipping costs. These are ex-post factors irrelevant to assessing compensation at the

relevant date required under the Treaty (30 September or 10 October 2010).

257

9.226

9.227

9.228

In the Tribunal’s view, KNI’s purchases during the period from 11 October 2010 to 28
February 2012 operated to reduce KNI’s loss assessed at the relevant date. It was highly
improbable, if not actually impossible, for the FertiNitro Plant to deliver to KNI during this
period both those purchases and the offtake to which KNI was entitled under the Offtake
Agreement, in addition to its other local commitments. The FertiNitro Plant did not have
that spare reliable capacity for ammonia and urea. In these circumstances, whilst those
purchases did not take the place of such offtakes, they nonetheless operated as a reasonable
form of mitigation so as to reduce KNI’s loss resulting from its expropriated interest in the
Offtake Agreement. The Tribunal estimates the value of this factor at US$ 21.7 million,
based on Mr Giles’ testimony at the Second (November) Hearing.% Accordingly, in the

Tribunal’s view, KNI’s claim must be reduced by US$ 21.7 million.

As to other major issues, the majority of the Tribunal considers that KNI and Mr Giles are
correct in identifying the principal replacement supply as US Gulf at US Gulf prices
(NOLA for urea and Tampa for ammonia) in a liquid market, rather than a mid-Caribbean
market at mid-Caribbean prices in a very limited market. Hence, the majority of the
Tribunal finds, there was no replacement supply available to KNI at prices comparable to

the Offtake Agreement for KNI.

In particular, the majority of the Tribunal accepts the factual testimony of Mr Sorlie, upon
which Mr Giles based his expert evidence. It merits citing at some length. In his second

witness statement, Mr Sorlie testified:

“12. [...] KNI is a committed offtaker from three ammonia production plants in
Trinidad and Tobago. Even when KNI was purchasing FertiNitro tons its North
American demand for products exceeded its Caribbean supply volumes. As such,
KNI always sought and continues to seek to purchase any profitable nitrogen
fertilizer that becomes available on a FOB basis in the Caribbean. However, because
of the long-term offtake arrangements described above and the fact that Trinidad and
Tobago exporters already have established customer networks, very few Caribbean
tons have been available over the years for purchase by KNI.

9 Second (November) Hearing, Tim Giles’ presentation, Slide 24.

258

13. Since 2006, KNI has been able to purchase only a small amount of Caribbean
sourced tons outside of its long term offtake arrangements. The primary example was
KNI's ability, between 2006 and 2010, to purchase a total of 211,000 metric tons of
ammonia from one Trinidad and Tobago plant partially owned by Terra Industries.
This volume equates to approximately 1% of the total Trinidad and Tobago ammonia
production during this period. In 2010 CF Industries acquired Terra Industries. This
resulted in almost all of the excess ammonia volumes from that plant being
transported to the US by CF Industries for use as raw materials in its North American
business or for sale to CF customers. As a result, since 2011 KNI has only been able
to purchase 3,500 metric tons of ammonia which equates to approximately 0.1% of
the total Trinidad and Tobago ammonia production.

14. For the aforementioned reasons, it is incorrect for Dr. Flores to assume that KNI
can replace lost FertiNitro offtake volumes by purchasing other products on an FOB
basis in the Caribbean. Instead KNI's alternative is to purchase ammonia and urea
at prices equivalent to NOLA and Tampa prices.”°”°

9.229 At the First (September) Hearing, Mr Sorlie was cross-examined by the Respondent, inter

alia, as follows:

“@Q. [...] Am I correct [in] assuming that KNI has continued supplying the US
customers that it originally supplied with under the Offtake Agreement?

A. Like I have said previous(ly), we continued to make sales in the United States
because we have a very competitive break bulk distribution business that is a
profitable business, and so we're going to continue to make those sales with or
without the FertiNitro offtake, and without the FertiNitro offtake we have to source
those tonnes from other origins to supply that market, to supply that short we have.
Q. So you are saying that you have been able to replace the amounts that you were,
in the past, obtaining under the Offtake Agreement, by product from other sources?
A. Yes, ata NOLA and Tampa price structure.

Q. So you're saying you're now purchasing those same products on the NOLA and
Tampa prices?

A. Since we do not have the FertiNitro offtake, we have had to go into the market
and we have to buy those tonnes in, and we are doing that at a NOLA and a Tampa
price equivalent.”°"'

The Respondent did not accept Mr Sorlie’s evidence; but it adduced no cogent factual
evidence of its own. As already indicated, the Tribunal accepts Mr Sorlie’s testimony, to
the effect that whatever alternative supplies were available to KNI to replace offtake under

the Offtake Agreement, these were at NOLA and Tampa prices or equivalent.

Mr Giles and Dr Flores appear to have valued this particular factor as US$ 92.2 million.°””
In the Tribunal’s view, given its findings above, KNI’s claim does not require any

reduction for this factor.

As to assumed freight costs, the Tribunal accepts KNI’s case based on Mr Giles’ sample
of actual freight costs from José, Venezuela to the US Gulf. Albeit limited to shipping
invoices in 2009/2010, it remains the best evidence of such estimated freight costs as

confirmed by Mr Sorlie’s testimony.°”

As to lambda and discount rates, the Tribunal accepts Mr Giles’ expert evidence that lamda
should be reduced because FertiNitro’s exposure to country risk was lessened by the access
to its own dock facilities for offtakes to be exported to KNI under the Offtake Agreement.
In these circumstances, the Tribunal adopts Mr Giles’ /ambda as 0.40 (towards its upper
limit) for FertiNitro and not Dr Flores’ factor of 1.0. As to the discount rate, namely the
amount by which KNI’s lost future cash flows must be discounted to arrive at their value
at the relevant date, the Tribunal adopts the approach taken by Mr Giles. For these issues,
it appears that the total difference between Mr Giles and Dr Flores amounts to US$ 36.4
million.° In addition, Dr Flores reduces Mr Giles’ valuation by US$ 2 million owing to
differences between the two experts regarding production volumes. In the Tribunal’s view,

KNI’s claim does not require any reductions for these factors invoked by Dr Flores.

As to the Urea Decree and Urea Resolution, the Tribunal adopts the approach of Advantis
in assuming, as at September 2010, that these urea regulations would not have continued.

Mr Giles’ approach did not take into account for the calculation of KNI’s compensation

the effect of the urea regulations after 28 February 2012 (in contrast to his separate
assessment of compensation for “Historical Losses”). Dr Flores assumed that the urea
regulations would continue beyond 28 February 2012. In the Tribunal’s view, with the
assumption reasonably made by Advantis for September 2010, KNI’s claim (as calculated
by Mr Giles) does not require any reduction for the effect of the Urea Decree and Urea

Resolution.

The resulting arithmetic is relatively straightforward by reference to the figures listed
above. Allocating the difference of US$ 150.3 million between the competing valuations
of Mr Giles and Dr Flores, the Tribunal decides as follows: it rejects Dr Flores’ reductions
of US$ 92.2 million (regarding mid-Carribean pricing) and US$ 36.4 million (regarding
lambda and discount rate assumptions); and it rejects Dr Flores’ further reduction of US$
2 million (regarding production assumptions), the whole totalling US$ 128.6 million.
Conversely, the Tribunal reduces the claim by US$ 21.7 million (regarding product
delivered to KNI during the period from 10 October 2010 and 28 February 2012), as
explained in paragraph 9.226 above.

Accordingly, doing the best it can on the available materials, the Tribunal (by a majority)
assesses under Article 6 of the Treaty, the fair market value of KNI’s expropriated interest
in the Offtake Agreement as at 10 October 2010 (or 30 September 2010) was US$ 184.8
million (ie. US$ 206.5 million less US$ 21.7 million).

Decisions: For these reasons, the Tribunal decides under Article 6 of the Treaty: (i)
KOMSA’s compensation in the total principal sum of US$ 140.25 million; and (ii), by a
majority, KNI’s compensation in the total principal sum of US$ 184.8 million, both

assessed as at 10 October 2010 (or, being materially the same, 30 September 2010).

PART X: SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The Tribunal summarises below its several conclusions reached in the earlier parts of this

Award.

Jurisdiction: The Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection to KNI’s claim
in respect of its interest in the Offtake Agreement, as concluded in Part VI above. The
Tribunal confirms its jurisdiction to decide all claims advanced by the Claimants against

the Respondent in this arbitration, under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention.

Liability: The Tribunal finds the Respondent liable to KOMSA for the unlawful
expropriation of its indirect interest in FertiNitro under Article 6 of the Treaty, as concluded
in Part VII above. The Tribunal (by a majority) finds the Respondent liable to KNI for the
unlawful expropriation of its interest in the Offtake Agreement, as also concluded in Part

VII above.

The Tribunal dismisses KOMSA’s non-expropriation claims advanced as “Historical

Losses” under Articles 4 and 11 of the Treaty, as concluded in Part VIII above.

Compensation: The Tribunal decides KOMSA’s compensation in the total principal sum
of US$ 140.25 million under the Treaty, as concluded in Part IX above. The Tribunal (by
a majority) decides KNI’s compensation in the total principal sum of US$ 184.8 million,

as also concluded in Part IX above.

Principal Issues: The Tribunal has used the lists of principal issues set out in Part III above
as a checklist, where applicable, for its several conclusions and decisions. Save as
summarised above, the Tribunal does not think it necessary to set out here its approach to

each of these principal issues seriatim.

PART XI: INTEREST AND COSTS

() Introduction

11.1 As to interest, the Parties completed their respective submissions on interest issues by joint
email messages dated 26 July 2016. The principal issue relates to whether simple or
compound interest should be ordered by the Tribunal on the principal sums for which the
Respondent is liable to pay to the Claimants. The lesser issue relates to the use of 3-month
Libor (as the Claimants contend) or the use of three-month Libor or 6-month US Treasury

bills (as the Respondent contends).

11.2 For the purpose of deciding costs in this Award, in addition to the Parties’ written
submissions of 13 February 2015, the Tribunal has also taken into account the Parties’
subsequent submissions dated 8 and 12 July 2016 as regards the allocation and assessment

of costs updated to 12 July 2016.

(2) Interest

11.3. The Claimants’ Case: In summary,”

the Claimants contend that they are entitled to pre-
award and post-award compound interest on compensation ordered by the Tribunal. They

make three principal submissions in support of their case.

11.4 _ First, the Claimants contend that the Treaty confirms that compound interest is payable by
the Respondent. Article 6 of the BIT requires that compensation be paid in the case of
expropriation including interest at a normal commercial rate. That normal commercial
rate, so the Claimants contend, must include an element of compounding. That approach
is consistent with the tribunal’s decision in the Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela®”® case:

“TA] normal commercial rate generally includes compounding of interest [...] [T]here is a

October 2014) (RLA-153), Paragraph 399.

263

growing tendency of international tribunals to award such interest in order to ensure full

compensation of the damage.”°””

11.5. Second, the Claimants submit that ICSID’s ‘jurisprudence constante’ confirms that
compound interest is payable by the Respondent. In that regard, the Claimants point to the

decision in Gemplus SA v. United Mexican States:°"*

“[I]t is clear from the legal materials cited by the Claimants [...] that the current
practice of international tribunals (including ICSID) is to award compound and not
simple interest. In the Tribunal’s opinion, there is now a form of ‘jurisprudence
constante’ where the presumption has shifted from the position a decade or so ago
with the result [that] it would now be more appropriate to order compound interest,
unless shown to be inappropriate in favour of simple interest, rather than vice-

versa, 619

11.6 Third, the Claimants point to scholarly commentaries confirming that compound interest

is payable in current circumstances. °°

11.7 As to rate, the Claimants propose a Libor 3-month US Dollar rate plus 2% compounded on

a quarterly basis.

11.8 The Respondent’s Case: In summary, *!

the Respondent contends that simple interest and
not compound interest is appropriate. It submits that Article 6 of the Treaty does not permit

the award of compound interest, unless (which is not the present case) a claimant can prove

that it has actually suffered compound interest as damages. In the event that the Tribunal
decided to award compound interest, the Respondent submits that the compounding should

be annual and not quarterly (as the Claimants request) or monthly (as Mr Giles proposes).

As to rate, the Respondent submits that a risk-free rate is appropriate, such as six-month
US Treasury bills. The Claimants’ proposal to calculate interest based on the LIBOR three-
month U.S. dollar rate plus 2% is inappropriate for calculating interest in an investor-State
dispute. The function of pre-award interest is to compensate a claimant for the time value
of money and the lost opportunity to invest money. However, in contrast to contractual
business obligations, there is no commercial risk involved in a monetary award in investor-

State arbitration under the ICSID Convention.*?

The Tribunal’s Decision: The Tribunal decides to award compound and not simple interest.
In its view, the reference in Article 6 of the Treaty to “interest” includes compound interest.
The wording clearly does not exclude it. Indeed, in modern times, it would be ‘abnormal’
for interest to be limited to simple interest. In the absence of contrary wording in a BIT,
the general approach to interest was confirmed long ago by the decision in Santa Elena v.

Costa Rica:°

“In particular, where an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the value of
his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then became due to him,
the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that
his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested
each year at generally prevailing rates of interest. It is not the purpose of compound
interest to attribute blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the payment made
to the expropriated owned; it is a mechanism to ensure that the compensation

 

awarded the claimant is appropriate in the circumstance.

11.11 It would be possible to add references to many other decisions to such effect, in addition

to doctrinal writings over many years. It is unnecessary to do so here.°**

11.12 As to rate, the Tribunal considers US$ Libor as a more international commercial rate than
the rate for US Treasury bills. It is also more often used in both investor-State and
commercial arbitrations. The Tribunal selects as the appropriate rate in this case US$ 6-
month Libor plus 2%, compounded with 6-month rests, for both pre-award and post-award
interest. As to the uplift, this does not reflect the presence or absence of commercial risk,
but rather the fact that Libor is calculated for use between financial institutions for

relatively short terms — neither of which is applicable here.

11.13. As to the former’s starting date, the Tribunal fixes upon 11 October 2010, being the date

of expropriation, under Article 6.

11.14 In conclusion, the Tribunal decides to order pre-award interest from 11 October 2010 to
the date of this Award on the principal sums payable to the Claimants respectively,
calculated at US$ 6-month Libor plus 2%, compounded with 6-month rests. As to post-
award interest from the date of this Award until payment to the Claimants respectively, the
Tribunal decides to order on the said principal sums (together with pre-award interest)

interest calculated at US$ 6-month Libor plus 2%, compounded with 6-month rests.

11.15 Both the Claimants and the Respondent request an order of costs in respect of both the fees
and expenses they incurred (“Legal Costs”) and the costs, fees and expenses of the Tribunal
and ICSID in connection with this arbitration for which the Parties are jointly and severally

liable (“Arbitration Costs”).

11.20 The above arbitration costs have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID in equal
parts by the Claimants and Respondent.®? As a result, their respective share of the costs

of arbitration amounts to US$ 628,836.435.

11.21 The Tribunal’s Decision: Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that: “[t]he

Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the

87 The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case.
688 This amount includes charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).
689 Any remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

11.24

parties in connection with the proceedings and shall decide how and by whom these
expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use
of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.”
ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1) provides that the Tribunal’s Award “shall contain [...] (j)

any decision [...] regarding the cost of the proceeding.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the ICSID Convention grants to the Tribunal a broad discretion to
allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the
Parties as it deems appropriate in the circumstances. The Tribunal does not understand

such a discretion to be contested between the Parties.

In the Tribunal’s view, these circumstances are clear in the present case. The Claimants’
cases have substantially but not completely prevailed over the cases advanced by the
Respondent, as regards jurisdiction, liability (save as regard KOMSA’s “Historical
Losses”), compensation (in part) and interest. As a general principle, therefore, the
Claimants should recover from the Respondent a proportion of their legal costs and such
of the arbitration costs as have been borne by the Claimants. Conversely, the Respondent
should bear its own legal costs and the Parties’ arbitration costs in full, without any recourse

to the Claimants.

The Tribunal has considered whether the legal costs incurred by the Claimants have been
reasonably incurred in reasonable amounts. There is a marked disparity between the total
amounts of the Parties’ respective legal costs, even allowing for the legal burden resting
on the Claimants to prove their respective cases. In other circumstances, it would be
necessary to undertake further inquiries as to why the Claimants expended almost twice as
much on legal costs than the Respondent. However, this case had from the outset certain
unusual, aggravating and special features. It began, as already indicated, with the principal
dispute limited to the amount of compensation due to KOMSA; but it soon became much
more complicated and wide-ranging. These proceedings were also protracted, particularly
with the Respondent’s two unsuccessful challenges to members of the Tribunal, the
consequential suspensions of the arbitration pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6), the
untimely death of one of its members and the procedure for replacing that arbitrator.

Moreover, it is a difficult task for any tribunal to second-guess, at a much later date, what

270

11.25

11.26

a party felt necessary to spend at the time in pursuit of its claims, with its own money. For
these several reasons, the Tribunal accepts the figures advanced by the Claimants for their

legal costs, subject to the following.

KOMSA did not succeed in regard to its “Historical Claims”; and the claims by KOMSA
and KNI for compensation only succeeded in part. The Tribunal decides that the Claimants
incomplete success should be reflected in a reduction in the Claimants’ recovery of their
legal costs by 25%. The Tribunal does not consider it possible to separate out legal costs
as between KOMSA or KNI. As regards the Claimants’ arbitration costs, the Tribunal

decides that these should be borne in full by the Respondent, without any reduction.

In conclusion, the effect of the Tribunal’s decisions can be stated as follows: the Claimants
shall recover from the Respondent the total sum of US$ 17,436,085.10 as Legal Costs and
the total sum of US$ 628,836.435 as Arbitration Costs. The Tribunal orders such total
sums to bear post-award interest from the date of this Award until payment, at the same
rate applicable to the amounts of compensation due to the Claimants; but it decides not to

award any pre-award interest on these sums.

Tribunal);

The Respondent shall pay as compensation to the First and Second Claimants respectively
