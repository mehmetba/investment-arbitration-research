B. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE

6. This section provides a general statement of the main facts underlying the dispute. It
purports to put the dispute in its context, rather than to provide an exhaustive description

of all the events relevant for the dispute.

1. The privatization of the land

7. The dispute concerns three parcels of land (called “La Herradura’, “Punta del Sol”, and
“La Chira”), located along Peru’s Pacific Coast near Lima, within the Municipality of
Chorrillos. The three parcels of land are adjacent to the so-called “Morro Solar”, an area
that is claimed to be the site of one of the most important battles in Peruvian history, the
Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos, which occurred in 1881 in the Pacific War between
Peru and Chile (“the Battle”).

8. On 19 September 1977, as the centennial anniversary of the Battle was approaching,
Peru's Ministry of Housing and Construction issued Resolution No. 2019-77-VC-1100

(the “1977 Resolution”) declaring the Morro Solar intangible.?

9. On 30 December 1986, Peru's National Institute of Culture (“INC” by its Spanish initials)
issued Resolution No. 794-86-ED (the “1986 Resolution”). Through this Resolution the
INC declared as “Monuments” a number of buildings and areas, including the Morro

Solar.

10. The scope and import of both the 1977 Resolution and the 1986 Resolution are disputed
between the Parties.

11. In 1995, the Municipality of Chorrillos held a public bidding process (which goes by the
name of Concurso de Proyectos Integrales)‘ to sell the three parcels of land to private
individuals on the basis of the projects that these individuals proposed for the
development of the land.° As a result of these procedures, the three parcels were

transferred to the winning bidder.

12. On 21 August 1995, La Herradura was awarded to the company JC Contratistas
Generals EIRL (“JC Contratistas”). The sales contract for this parcel of the land was
concluded on 22 August 1995.° On 8 September 1995, Gremco, a Peruvian company
belonging to the Levy Group,’ acquired the land from JC Contratistas for US$ 3 million.
This sales contract was approved by the Municipality of Chorrillos on 12 September
1995.

13. On 7 November 1995, the Municipality of Chorrillos awarded the bid concerning Punta

del Sol to Gremco, and the relating sales contract of the land was concluded on

2 Resolution Declaring the Morro Solar Intangible, Supreme Resolution No. 219-77-VC-1100, 19
September 1977 (Exh. C-069; Exh. R-002) (“RESOLVES: 1. To declare intangible the land of the Morro
Solar of Chorrillos and the bordering land indicated in map Nos. 5 and 6 of the General Zoning Plan of
Metropolitan Lima 1977-1990 [...]”, Tribunal’s translation).

15 November 1995. Gremco agreed to pay US$ 1 million for the land, plus US$ 3.3
million of in-kind public construction works.®

14. On 18 December 1995, Gremco was awarded the third parcel of land, La Chira. The
related sales contract was signed on 28 December 1995. Gremco agreed to pay US$ 1

million for the land, plus US$ 2.5 million of in-kind public construction works."°

15. The sales contract for La Herradura contains the following clause:

“6.03. If necessary, and at the request of the buyer, the Municipality [of
Chorrillos] must lend its official support in the requests that the Buyer must
effectuate before the Municipality of Lima [...] as well as before any other
competent authority for obtaining the authorizations that may be required for
an adequate development of the Project [...]."""

16. The sales contracts for La Chira and Punta del Sol contain similar language.”

17. The precise legal effects of the three contracts are disputed between the Parties. While
according to the Claimants they created the obligation upon Peru to facilitate the
execution of the project and to issue the necessary permits to this end,'? the Respondent
contends that such contracts did not give Gremco the right to develop the land free from

the legal restrictions that were applicable to such areas.'4

18. The three projects were later consolidated by Gremco into the “Costazul Project”, a
tourism and real estate "urban megaproject"."®

19. Certain differences between Gremco and the Municipality of Chorrillos over the
obligations arising under those sales contracts were submitted to a domestic arbitration
pursuant to the arbitration clauses contained in such contracts. The arbitration resulted
in an arbitral award of 15 January 2001, which declared the sales contracts valid and
ordered the Municipality to comply with its obligations regarding certain registrations in

the public registry and the release of a specific part of the land."®

22.

Between 2003 and 2004 the Peruvian company Gremcitel, one of the two Claimants in
this arbitration, acquired the land and the rights relating to the Costazul Project from
Gremco. Both Gremcitel and Gremco are, according to the Claimants, part of the Levy
Group.” The price agreed for the sale of La Herradura and La Chira was set at US$ 60
million, to be paid from the future cash flow which would result from the projects on the
two parcels of land.’® The contract also provided that Gremco would retain 99% of the
future profits from the Costazul Project and Gremcitel would only receive 1% as a project
management fee. The payment for these two parcels was later suspended in an
agreement between Gremco and Gremcitel.'? In this respect, the Respondent contends

that no price was ever paid for such sale.2°

The sales contract for Punta del Sol was concluded on 15 January 2004 and provided
for a price of S/. (Peruvian Nuevos Soles) 42,144,520.00 (equivalent to around US$ 12
million) to be paid after a 5-year grace period.’ The Parties agreed that Gremcitel would
pay the value of the land by entering into an advertising agreement that would promote

the Costazul Project. The grace period was subsequently extended until 2020.22

The events up to October 2007

After Gremco acquired the land from the Municipality of Chorrillos, a number of
interactions occurred between Gremco (and later Gremcitel) and various governmental
and municipal authorities, in the form of exchanges of correspondence, applications for
permits or authorizations, and reports. The aim of many of these exchanges with the
Peruvian authorities was for Gremco/Gremcitel to identify potential areas in which
development would be restricted. This section summarizes the most important of these
exchanges and other occurrences involving the Authority of the Costa Verde Project (a.),

the National Institute of Culture (b.) and the Municipality of Chorrillos (c.).

23. The Authority of the Costa Verde Project (“APCV” by its Spanish initials) is a
governmental body entrusted with the preservation, protection and sustainable
development of Peru’s Pacific Coast ecosystem known as Costa Verde, which includes
the three parcels of land owned by the Claimants. In particular, the APCV ensures that
any land development along the Costa Verde complies with the Costa Verde Master
Plan.23

24. Once La Herradura, La Chira and Punta del Sol had been consolidated to form the
Costazul Project, the APCV granted Gremco the Prior Certification of Compatibility with
the Costa Verde Master Plan through Resolution 015-2003/MML/IMP, issued by Lima's
Metropolitan Institute of Planning (APCV's technical secretariat) on 18 June 2003.24

25. In August 2006, Gremcitel applied for the Final Certification of Compatibility for part of
the land, which has not been issued by the APCV to date. This certification would be
granted following an in-depth review of the project and would be the final step in the
APCV's evaluation.

b. The National Institute of Culture?

26. In July 2001, Gremco submitted a proposal for the historical delimitation of the Morro
Solar to the INC.2° A year later, in May 2002, Gremco and the INC signed an Agreement
of Cooperation. The purpose of the Agreement was to "carry out joint actions to delimit

the archeological areas" located in the Claimants' property.2”

27. Following this Agreement and subsequent archeological investigations, the INC's
National Technical Commission of Archeology (“CNTA” by its Spanish initials), issued
Decision No. 330 of 25 June 2003. The CNTA determined that there were "no new
grounds to lift the intangibility of the Morro Solar [...] and therefore ratified] its
monumental nature established by [1977 Resolution]”.28 Such decision also established

24 IMP Directorial Resolution No. 015-2003/MML/IMP, 18 June 2003 (part of Exh. C-050;
Exh. R-068).

25 In 2010, the INC was subsumed into the Ministry of Culture or "MOC". See Law Creating the Ministry
of Culture, Law No. 29565, 22 July 2010 (Exh. R-044).

that "Gremco S.A. should submit and carry out an evaluation project aimed at the
delimitation, prospecting and restricted excavation" of part of its land.2°

28. The CNTA also referred the file to the National Technical Commission of Qualifying
Architectural Projects (“CNTCPA’” by its Spanish initials) responsible for the evaluation
of historical, as opposed to archeological, cultural heritage in Peru.*° In its Decision No. 1
of 11 August 2003, the CNTCPA stated that it "concur[red] technically with all of the
views taken by the [CNTA] in its Decision N° 330" and advised Gremco how to handle
the archeological and historical sites found on its land, noting that any urban

development plans would have to be submitted to the INC for approval.*"

29. Following a re-evaluation request put forward by Gremco, the INC convened a special
joint session of the CNTA and the CNTCPA, which issued a Joint Decision on 10
December 2003.2 In this decision, the two Commissions ratified Decision No. 330 and

therefore maintained the intangibility of the Morro Solar.

30. On that same date, Gremco submitted a report to the INC regarding the implementation
of their Agreement of Cooperation, containing a delimitation proposal for the

archeological and historical areas.°*

31. Gremco also sent the INC a letter attaching a legal report on 23 December 2003, claiming
that Decision No. 330 was null and void.** Through March and April 2004, Gremco sent
several letters to the INC regarding the delimitation of the historical and archeological
sites, once again criticizing Decision No. 330 for adopting different delimitation criteria

than those applied with regard to other archeological sites in Lima,*® proposing that each

29 Ibid., at “Resolved”, ] 5 (Tribunal's translation).

3° A distinction must be made between archeological and historical cultural heritage. Peru's legal
framework distinguishes between (i) cultural heritage from the pre-Hispanic era (archaeological) and (ii)
cultural heritage from the colonial and republican eras (historical). See Regulation on Archaeological
Investigations, Supreme Resolution No. 004-2000-ED, 24 January 2000 (part of Exh. C-045; Exh. R-
010); General Law of National Cultural Heritage, Law No. 28296, 21 July 2004 (part of Exh. C-044; Exh.
R-034).

32. Following this correspondence, the CNTA issued Decision No. 197 of 25 May 2004,°8 in
which it delimited the individual archeological areas. It thereby reduced the area that

was considered intangible for archeological reasons.

33. On 12 July 2004, the INC created an Ad Hoc Commission "to assess and review the
status of the land owned by Gremco."3? The Ad Hoc Commission issued a report on
14 October 2004 with recommendations regarding the delimitation of both the
archeologically and historically relevant areas within Gremco’s land. In particular, the Ad
Hoc Commission issued the following “recommendations”, the scope and import of which
are disputed:

“4. That the National Institute of Culture determine the intangible area,
delimiting it to an area corresponding to the historic zone of the Morro Solar
declared a Historical Monument, recognizing for the monumental area a
zone that surrounds the actual formal commemorations and includes the
Monument of the Unknown Soldier, the monument of General Iglesias, the
Observatory, the Obus, the Cross of the Morro and the Chapel of the Virgin.

2. As a result of the above, the National Institute of Culture requests that the
Ministry of Education, in the exercise of its functions, perfect the Ministerial
Resolution No. 794-86-ED and establish the boundaries of the above-
mentioned Historical Monument.”*°

34. On 26 November 2004, the INC issued Resolution No. 1260/INC,47 which provided a
number of Certificates of Inexistence of Archeological Artifacts ("CIRA" by its Spanish
initials) for those areas free of any archeological remains. Through the years 2005 to
2007, the INC issued further CIRAs.‘2 The Claimants contend that by the time Resolution

favor, attesting that around 80% of the Claimants’ land was free of archeological artifacts

impeding the development of the project.4?

35. Resolution No. 1260/INC of 26 November 2004, together with Resolution No. 184/INC
of 22 February 2005,“ also created a Historical Commission entrusted with “proposing
the delimitation of the intangible historical area of Morro Solar’.46 That Commission
issued a Report in July 2005 proposing boundaries of the intangible historical area of the
Morro Solar.*° The Report was the basis for the subsequent 2007 Resolution issued by
the INC, which largely adopted the delimitation resulting from the study by the Historical
Commission.4”7 The Respondent claims that the Historical Commission conducted a
careful review of historical evidence related to the Battle. The Claimants in turn view the
findings of the Historical Commission as arbitrary and claim that the 2005 Report was "a
document for the INC's internal use that was not communicated to Gremco or
Gremcitel."*®

c. The Municipality of Chorrillos

36. On 22 March 2006, Gremcitel applied for the so-called Urban Development Permit
(Habilitacién Urbana) for part of the La Herradura parcel. Because the Municipality of
Chorrillos did not react (neither approving nor denying the application) within 60 days,
Gremcitel considered that the application had been granted by “positive administrative
silence” (silencio administrativo positivo) and registered the Urban Development Permit
at Lima's Public Registry.4°

3. Resolution No. 1342/INC of 10 October 2007

37. On 10 October 2007, the INC issued Resolution 1342/INC (the “2007 Resolution”), which
provided a precise delimitation of the boundaries of the Morro Solar.5° According to the

Claimants, this act imposed on the land an intangibility status which did not exist until
then and thus rendered the Costazul Project meaningless.®' For the Claimants, the 2007

Resolution is the measure that gave rise to the dispute.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIAL PHASE

On 5 November 2010, the Claimants set in motion the 6-month negotiation period
pursuant to Article 8(2) of the BIT.52 Negotiation efforts were reiterated on 6 December
2010% and 11 March 2011.5

On 9 May 2011, the Claimants considered that the negotiation period had expired and

manifested their acceptance of the offer to arbitrate contained in the BIT.>

On 17 May 2011, the Claimants filed their Request for arbitration. On 24 June 2011, the
Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request.

On 29 August 2011, following appointment by the Claimants, Eduardo Zuleta, a
Colombian national, accepted his appointment as arbitrator. On 21 September 2011,
following appointment by the Respondent, Raul Vinuesa, an Argentinean and Spanish
national, accepted his appointment as arbitrator. On 21 November 2011, following
appointment by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, Gabrielle Kaufmann-
Kohler, a Swiss national, accepted her appointment as presiding arbitrator.

On 22 November 2011, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was
deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun. On the same
date, the Centre informed the Parties that Ms. Alicia Martin Blanco, ICSID Legal Counsel,
would serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 19 April 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties held a first session in Washington, D.C.

On 4 May 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning procedural

matters and the procedural calendar.

WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION AND MERITS.

On 17 August 2012, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, with one witness

statement and three expert reports.

On 21 December 2012, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-

Memorial on the Merits, with six witness statements and three expert reports.

The Respondent filed a request for document production on 22 January 2013. The

Claimants filed a request for document production on 25 January 2013.

On 19 February 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning production

of documents.

On 26 March 2013, the Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial

on Jurisdiction, with three witness statements and five expert reports.

On 28 May 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning new requests
for production of documents filed on 24 April 2013 by the Respondent and on 2 May
2013 by the Claimants.

By letter dated 1 July 2013, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and
Jurisdiction. The Respondent explained that it had included in its brief a section on
jurisdiction because it had received through document production, conducted after it had
filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, a number of new

documents related to jurisdiction that it had previously not had an opportunity to address.

By letter of 17 July 2013, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal not bifurcate the
proceedings between jurisdiction and merits. On 24 July 2013, the Respondent agreed
on a non-bifurcated proceeding. On 30 July 2013, the Tribunal confirmed that the

Hearing would thus deal with both jurisdiction and merits issues.

On 30 September 2013, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the
Parties by telephone conference.
On 2 October 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 on the organization of

the Hearing.

On 24 October 2013, the Tribunal, upon request of the Claimants and after having heard
the Respondent, granted the Claimants leave to introduce two new documents into the

record.

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES AND RELIEF REQUESTED

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

In its written and oral submissions, the Claimants have made the following main

submissions.

63.

64.

65.

On jurisdiction

The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute. The Claimants fulfill the
nationality requirements set forth in Articles 25 of the ICSID Convention and 1 of the BIT.
In particular, Ms. Levy holds French nationality (and does not hold Peruvian nationality),
and has owned and controlled Gremcitel, a Peruvian company, indirectly since 2005
(through the company Hart Industries Ltd., hereinafter “Hart Industries”) and directly
since 2007. Ms. Levy’s ownership and control of Gremcitel thus confer French nationality
to Gremcitel, pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the
BIT.

There is a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment. Article 1 of the BIT defines
investment in broad terms, including movable and immovable property, shares,
obligations, rights to performance having economic value, and the Claimants’ investment

falls within such broad definition.
Qn the merits

The Respondent has breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment
pursuant to Article 3 of the BIT. In particular, the Claimants advance the following

arguments:

e The Respondent has frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations that they
would be able to develop the Costazul Project. The 2007 Resolution rendered

their investment meaningless.

e The Respondent also failed to act transparently when it did not involve the
Claimants in the approval process for the 2007 Resolution. Further, the
declaration of intangibility contained in the 2007 Resolution as well as the “erratic
and contradictory behavior’ by the INC were “unpredictable”,5* and thus

constituted a violation of the obligation to maintain a stable legal framework.

e Moreover, the issuance of the 2007 Resolution constituted an act which was
arbitrary, because it lacked any technical and objective foundation, and was in
contradiction with existing provisions and regulations. The Claimants were also
discriminated against certain local populations, which despite residing on similarly
protected areas of the Morro Solar, were not treated in the same way as the

Claimants.

66.

67.

68.

69.

70.

e Finally, the Respondent engaged in acts of bad faith, coercion, or harassment

towards the Claimants.

For these reasons, in their Reply on the Merits, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal
find that “it has jurisdiction on the Claimants’ claim and that such claim is admissible”.
The Claimants also requested the Tribunal to accept their claim on the merits and to
declare Peru’s international responsibility because of the breach of its obligations in the
BIT and award the Claimants the entirety of the damages sought, which their expert, Mr.
Ferro, quantified at US $ 41 billion.5”

In their last request for relief, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to:

“(1) Assume jurisdiction over all the claims filed by the Claimants against the
Republic of Peru on the basis of the Peru-France BIT.

(2) Declare that the Peruvian State is liable for the breach of the international
obligations assumed under the Peru-France BIT.

(3) Establish the damages incurred and interest applied.

(4) Require the Respondent to pay the costs and fees incurred by the
Claimants throughout the arbitral proceedings.

(5) Establish any additional damages and compensation that the Tribunal
deems appropriate.”>*

THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION AND REQUEST FOR RELIEF

In its written and oral submissions, the Respondent put forward the main following

arguments:

On jurisdiction/abuse of process

The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this dispute because the Claimants are not
“investors” within the meaning of the BIT. Ms. Levy has not put forward reliable evidence
as to her shareholding in Gremcitel, and the hurried transfer of shares which allegedly
made Ms. Levy the controlling shareholder of Gremcitel constitutes an “abuse of
process”, having been carried out for the sole purpose of attracting the France-Peru BIT
protection at a time the dispute had either already arisen or was at least entirely

foreseeable.
The Tribunal also lacks jurisdiction because the Claimants have no “investment” under

either the ICSID Convention or the BIT. Indeed, they have no “right to develop” the so-

called Costazul Project and Ms. Levy has not established that she made any financial

contribution to acquire the investment. Accordingly she took no risk when she allegedly

acquired her shares in Gremcitel.5°
On the merits

For the event that the Tribunal were to find that it had jurisdiction, the Respondent
requests the Tribunal to dismiss the claims. In particular: (i) the Claimants could have
no legitimate expectations that they could develop their land free from restrictions; (ii)
Peru has acted transparently at all times, and the 2007 Resolution should be seen as a
mere confirmation of the legal framework established by the previous 1977 and 1986
Resolutions; (iii) the 2007 Resolution’s delimitation is not arbitrary, as it was based ona
careful historical review; and finally (iv) Peru has not discriminated against the Claimants
nor committed any acts of coercion, harassment or in bad faith against them.

For these reasons, in its Rejoinder on the Merits and Jurisdiction, the Respondent
requested “that (i) the Tribunal dismiss Claimants’ claims for lack of jurisdiction; or, in the
event that the Tribunal were to find jurisdiction; (ii) dismiss Claimants’ claims for lack of
merit”.6°

Finally, the Respondent also requests an award of costs, including counsel fees, incurred
in these proceedings. The Respondent notes that “several events during the hearing —
e.g., Claimants’ decision not to question Ms. Harris after they demanded her presence
at the hearing and to abandon their transparency claims — have materially added to

Respondent's costs and provide additional reasons to award costs against Claimants”.®*

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Prior to entering the merits of the Parties' positions, the Tribunal will address the

relevance of previous decisions or awards (1) and the applicable legal framework (2).

RELEVANCE OF PREVIOUS DECISIONS AND AWARDS

°° Initially, the Respondent also requested that the Tribunal declare the Claimants’ claims inadmissible
because in the Respondent's view the same dispute that is before this Arbitral Tribunal was being
litigated in the Peruvian courts. See R-CM, J 214-223. This objection was later withdrawn by the
Respondent. See R-Rejoinder, p. 62, fn. 226 (“Peruvian courts dismissed all of Gremcitel’s challenges
to Resolution No. 1342/INC. [...] Because Gremcitel’s domestic law challenges to Resolution No.
1342/INC are now concluded, Respondent withdraws its objection to the admissibility of Claimants’
claims based on the litigation in Peru's courts”).

60 R-Rejoinder, | 490. The Respondent reiterated these requests for relief, on jurisdiction and the merits,
in its post-hearing submissions. See R-PHB 1, {| 99; R-PHB 2, {] 53.

®' R-PHB 1, 100.

75.

76.

77.

78.

79.

In support of their positions, both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards,
either to conclude that the same solutions should be adopted in the present case or in
an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from a solution reached by another

tribunal.

The Tribunal's view is that it is not bound by previous decisions of ICSID or other
arbitration tribunals. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it should pay due regard
to earlier decisions of international tribunals. The Tribunal is further of the view that,
unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, it has a duty to follow solutions
established in a series of consistent cases, comparable to the case at hand, but subject
of course to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case.
By doing so, it will meet its duty to contribute to the harmonious development of
investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of
States and investors towards certainty of the rule of law.£2

LEGAL FRAMEWORK

This arbitration is brought under the ICSID Convention and the France-Peru BIT. The
interpretation of these two instruments is governed by customary international law as
codified by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna Convention” or
"VCLT").

JURISDICTION / ABUSE OF PROCESS

Law APPLICABLE TO JURISDICTION

The Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention (1. below) and by the
BIT (2. below).

ICSID Convention

Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is governed by Article 25, which reads as

follows:

“(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the
Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the
parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the

®2 Arbitrator Eduardo Zuleta has a slightly different view only with respect to the text of paragraph 76,
which in no way affects his concurrence with, and affirmative vote for, the Award in this case.

23

parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent
unilaterally.

(2) "National of another Contracting State" means:

(a) any natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties
consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on
the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of
Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person
who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to
the dispute; and

(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties
consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any
juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to
the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties
have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for
the purposes of this Convention.”

2. The BIT

80. The France-Peru BIT was concluded in French and Spanish, both language versions
being equally authentic.®° The Parties have mainly referred to the Spanish version of the
Treaty, and indeed only the Spanish version has been put in the record.* At the Hearing,
the Tribunal asked the Parties about potential differences between the French and
Spanish versions of certain Treaty provisions, as a result of which the Respondent

referred to the French version of the Treaty in its post-hearing submissions.®>

81. The main provisions of the BIT are set out in both language versions below. Article 1 of
the Spanish version defines “investment”, “national”, and “company” in the following

terms:

“(1) El término "inversién" designa todos los activos tales como bienes,
derechos e intereses de toda naturaleza y, en particular, aunque no
exclusivamente:

(a) Los bienes muebles e inmuebles, asi como todo otro derecho real tales
como las hipotecas, privilegios, usufructos, fianzas y derechos similares;

(b) Las acciones, primas en emisién y otras formas de participacién, sean
minoritarias o indirectas, en las sociedades constituidas en el territorio de
una de las partes contratantes;

Dichos activos deben ser o haber sido invertidos conforme a la legislacién
de la Parte Contratante en el territorio o en el area maritima en la cual la
inversién es efectuada, antes o después de la entrada en vigencia del
presente Convenio.

Toda modificacién de la forma de inversién de los activos no afecta su
calificacion de inversion, siempre que esta modificacién no sea contraria a
la legislacién de la Parte Contratante en el territorio o en la zona maritima
en la cual la inversion es efectuada.

(2) El término "nacionales" designa toda persona fisica que posee la
nacionalidad de una de las partes.

(3) El término "sociedades" designa toda persona juridica constituida en el
territorio de una de las Partes Contratantes conforme a la legislacion de esta
parte y que posee alli su sede social, o es controlada directa o
indirectamente por nacionales de una de las Partes Contratantes, 0 por
personas juridicas que poseen su sede social en el territorio de una de las
Partes Contratantes y constituidas conforme a la legislacion de esta parte.

5. Les sentences arbitrales sont définitives et obligatoires."

OUTLINE

The Respondent has put forward the following objections relating to the jurisdiction of
the Arbitral Tribunal:®°

First, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the ICSID
Convention and the BIT because the Claimants have not demonstrated that they were
“investors” under the BIT at the time the events occurred that gave rise to the dispute.
For the Respondent, the documents that the Claimants have submitted purporting to
show Ms. Levy’s direct and indirect ownership of Gremcitel in 2005 and 2007 are rife
with inconsistencies, hand-written corrections, and unverifiable claims. In addition,
Gremcitel does not qualify as an investor under Article 8(3) of the BIT because it was

not controlled by a French national before the dispute at issue in this case emerged.

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ investment is an abuse of
process. In the Respondent's view, the irregularities of the documents purporting to
show Ms. Levy’s alleged ownership and the testimony at the Hearing demonstrate
that Ms. Levy attempted to acquire interest in Gremcitel in a hurry, when key actions

of the government were taken or were about to be taken. Such conduct is evidence

66 The Tribunal notes that the order and the presentation of the Respondent's objections has somewhat
varied throughout its pleadings. The Tribunal has chosen to discuss the objections in the order which
the Respondent has adopted in its first post-hearing submission. See R-PHB 1, {[{] 25-67 (where the
Respondent argues firstly that “Claimants are not investors”, secondly that “Claimants’ alleged
investment is an abuse of process”, and thirdly that “Claimants have no investment’).

27

that Ms. Levy acquired her alleged interest in Gremcitel for the sole purpose of
internationalizing an existing or foreseeable, and otherwise purely domestic, dispute,

which constitutes an abuse of process.

Third, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have no “investment” under either
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or the BIT. First, the Claimants have failed to
demonstrate that they ever had a “right to develop” the Costazul project, on which
they base their claim. Furthermore, they have failed to produce any evidence that
they have made any monetary contribution and thus have not undertaken any risk in

their alleged investment.
86. The Claimants have rebutted the Respondent's objections with the following arguments:

e First, Ms. Levy, a French national, acquired indirect control over Gremcitel in 2005
(when she acquired 33.3% of the shares in Hart Industries, which was the main
shareholder of Gremcitel) and direct control over Gremcitel in 2007 (when she
acquired 58.82% of the shares in Gremcitel). Therefore, Gremcitel should also be
considered a French company as it was under French control before the dispute arose
(in accordance with Article 8(3) of the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID

Convention).

Second, the Claimants submit that an allegation of abuse of process requires a high
standard to be met. The Respondent has not established that the Claimants had
foreseen the event which gave rise to the dispute (i.e., the issuance of the 2007
Resolution), and that they accordingly manipulated Gremcitel’s nationality to gain

access to ICSID.

Third, the Claimants have made an investment by acquiring the land and the relating
right to develop it, by holding rights and interests related to the land, as well as
licenses and other types of authorizations. These assets fall within the broad
definition of investment contained in Article 1 of the BIT as well as within Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, the Claimants contend that, while the 2005
transfer of shares occurred free of charge, this was due to the intra-family nature of
the corporate restructuring. In addition, Ms. Levy's 2007 acquisition of the Gremcitel
shares occurred in exchange of a payment in kind (through the exchange of shares

which she held in a company called “Holding XXI”).

87. The Parties’ detailed positions are summarized in the following paragraphs.

AND THE BIT

28

90.

The positions of the Parties with respect to this objection are presented as follows. First,
the Claimants’ main allegations of fact are set out (1. below). Second, the Respondent's
position is presented (2. below). Finally, the Claimants’ rebuttal to the Respondent's

objections is dealt with (3. below).

The Claimants’ main allegations

The Claimants contend that they fulfill the requirements ratione personae and temporis
pursuant to the BIT and the ICSID Convention. For the Claimants, the dispute arose on
18 October 2007 when the 2007 Resolution, which was issued on 10 October 2007, was
published in Peru’s Official Journal (Diario Oficial El Peruano).*’ On this date, they
contend, the BIT was in force and Ms. Levy was an indirect and direct shareholder in
Gremcitel. More specifically, the Claimants allege that Ms. Levy became an indirect
shareholder in Gremcitel in 2005 when she acquired shares in Hart Industries, one of
Gremcitel’s shareholders, and that she became direct shareholder by acquiring an
interest in Gremcitel in October 2007.

First, the Claimants argue that Ms. Levy acquired indirect ownership of Gremcitel in
2005, when she acquired 33.3% of the capital of Hart Industries, a Grenadian company
which owned 57,460 out of 64,000 shares in Gremcitel, i.e., 84.5%, until 9 October 2007.
The Claimants have produced the following documents to establish Ms. Levy's

ownership of shares in Hart Industries:

(i) Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 7 February 2005. The Claimants submit
that through this resolution, Mr. Levy, then sole shareholder and director of Hart
Industries, resolved to amend Article 7(2) of the Memorandum and Articles of Association
of Hart Industries in order to divide the 1000 shares into three groups, one of which would
be a group of 333 “preferred shares” that would exercise exclusive control over the
company.

(ii) Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 9 February 2005. It is the Claimants’
contention that this corporate resolution approved the transfer of the preferred shares

from Mr. Levy to his sister Ms. Levy.

(iii) Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 7 March 2005.70 According to the

Claimants, through this resolution, the 9 February 2005 transfer of the shares was ratified

and all powers and rights in the company were transferred to Ms. Levy “until all legal
proceedings concerning resolutions dated February 7th 2005 and February 9th 2005 are
finished”.

Second, the Claimants contend that on 9 October 2007 Ms. Levy acquired from Hart
Industries 40,000 shares in Gremcitel, i.e., 58.82%. It is the Claimants’ argument that
Ms. Levy received the 40,000 Gremcitel shares in exchange for her shareholding in the
company Holding XXI (a company registered in Panama).’’ The Claimants refer,
amongst other documents, to the registration of the sale of the shares in Gremcitel’s
Shareholders’ Registry Book of 9 October 2007,”2 as well as to the Share Transfer
Agreement for Holding XXI, bearing the same date.’?

The Respondent's position

The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute because
the Claimants have not shown that they were protected investors under the France-Peru
BIT at the time of the events allegedly giving rise to the dispute.”* For the Respondent,
the Claimants “must show that they owned or controlled a protected investment at the
time when the events about which they complain occurred”.”° More specifically, “Ms.
Levy must prove that any ownership interest she acquired in Gremcitel was acquired
before the challenged act occurred”.”6

a. Ms. Levy has not proven that she owned Gremcitel directly or indirectly at
the time of the 2007 Resolution

Even if it were correct (which the Respondent disputes) that the 2007 Resolution is the

measure which gave rise to the dispute (as the Claimants argue), the Respondent

contends that the Claimants have not discharged their burden to prove Ms. Levy's

ownership of Gremcitel, be it direct or indirect, at the time when the 2007 Resolution was

issued. According to the Respondent, the documents allegedly supporting the share

acquisitions are “questionable”’’ or “highly suspicious”.”8

i. Indirect shareholding in Gremcitel

The Respondent takes issue with the documents on which the Claimants rely to show
Ms. Levy's acquisition of an indirect interest in Gremcitel in 2005, specifically with the
corporate resolutions of Hart Industries of 7 February 2005,’° 9 February 2005,®° and
7 March 2005.*"

First, the Respondent contends that the Hart Industries corporate resolution of 7
February 2005, by which Mr. Levy purportedly resolved to amend the Memorandum and
Articles of Association of Hart Industries in order to divide the 1000 shares into three
groups, one of which would be a group of 333 “preferred shares” that would exercise
exclusive control over the company, is invalid because it has not been registered in the
Grenadian public registry.22. The Respondent refers to its expert on Grenadian law, Ms.
Sheila Harris, who explained in her expert report and at the Hearing that under
Grenadian law any amendment to a company’s Memorandum of Association must be
registered to come into effect. The Respondent underscores that at the Hearing, Ms.
Harris testified that the amendment was never registered in Grenada,®* and therefore,
under Grenadian law, the amendment — and thus also the subsequent share transfer to
Ms. Levy made pursuant to that amendment — never came into effect.8° According to
the Respondent, this means that Ms. Levy never became a shareholder in Hart
Industries.°° Because the Claimants had no answer to Ms. Harris’ testimony and
declined to cross-examine her, the Respondent submits that such testimony remains

unrebutted.

Second, with regard to the Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 9 February 2005
approving the transfer of the certificate representing the preferred shares from Mr. Levy
to his sister Ms. Levy, the Respondent identifies a discrepancy between the date of the

notarization of the document, which is 7 February 2005, and the date on the document
transferring the shares, which is 9 February 2005. According to the Respondent, a
notary public cannot witness signatures two days before the signatures were made.®”
Further, the Respondent notes that the stamp used by the notary public, Ms. Claudette
Joseph, for the notarization of the 9 February 2005 resolution indicated that her
commission would expire on 13 October 2011. Because in Grenada the duration of a
notary’s commission is 5 years, the Respondent submits that the corporate resolution
could only have been notarized after 13 October 2006, and not on 9 February 2005.8

97. Inresponse to these objections, the Claimants produced an undated “rectification” to the
notarization of the corporate resolution of Hart Industries of 9 February 2005.89 The
rectification reads as follows:

“| Claudette Joseph Notary Public in and for the state of Grenada, West Indie
hereby certify that this document was acknowled [sic] executed before me
by Mr. Isy Levy and withessed-before-me by Mr. Teddy R. St. Lou on the
9th day of February 2005.
| certify further that the date shown by me being 7th February 2005, was a
genuine error on my part.”

98. For the Respondent, this rectification does nothing but heighten suspicions about the
unreliable nature of the corporate documents invoked by the Claimants. In fact, the
Respondent sees a number of issues:

(i) the rectification must have occurred at least seven years after the original
notarization. While it is undated, the notary stamp records the expiration date of the
notary’s commission, which is 4 April 2017. Because of the 5-year duration of a notary’s
commission already mentioned, the rectification must, in the Respondent's view, have
occurred after 2012.9

(ii) the unreliability of the rectification is also evidenced by the struck-through words
written by the notary, which evidence her confusion as to what she actually
acknowledged;*"

(iii) it is unclear how the notary public exactly “acknowledged” Mr. Isy Levy's signature,
when, the Respondent argues, Mr. Levy was not in Grenada at that time, as shown by

a Report of the Ministry of Interior of Peru;2? and

(iv) the very notary public’s reliability is, in the Respondent's view, questionable as she
issued a legal opinion about the Claimants’ compliance with Grenadian corporate law
having herself been involved in the transaction.°3

The Respondent further argues that, at the Hearing, Ms. Joseph was confronted under
cross-examination with some of these issues. According to the Respondent, she
admitted that she backdated her notarization of the corporate resolution of 9 February
2005. She also conceded that she did not see the document until 2010 (i.e., 5 years
after the document was allegedly signed):

“the Resolution was presented to me sometime in 2010. The specific date |

can’t remember. And it was presented by Mr. St Louis and Mr. Levy, both

appearing in person before me ...”.°*
Therefore, the Respondent contends, Ms. Joseph had no way of knowing when the
document was created or signed.° Ms. Joseph also added that “[nJow, a specific request
was made for the document to be dated as of the date it was prepared and signed, which
is 2005”.2° The Respondent underscores that she also stated that she would never have
backdated the document had she known that it would be submitted to an international
arbitral tribunal.°”

Thus, according to the Respondent, “evidence on the record and testimony from the
hearing suggest that the second resolution, while nominally dated 9 February 2005, was
likely created in 2010 (well after the dispute arose) and backdated to 2005 for the

purposes of this arbitration”.°%

With regard to the rectification, the Respondent notes, Ms. Joseph explained that
sometime between April 2012 and March 2013, Mr. Levy came back to Ms. Joseph and
requested that she “correct” her initial backdated notarization so that it would be

consistent with the date when the document was allegedly executed.*

107.

Therefore, according to the Respondent, “Ms. Joseph’s testimony made it clear that
neither the original February 9, 2005 resolution nor the more recent ‘rectification’ is at
all credible, because there is no way to verify when the actual execution of the document

occurred”. 1°

Third, the Respondent submits that it is unclear why the Hart Industries corporate
resolution of 7 March 2005, which approved the 9 February 2005 transfer of the shares
“until all legal proceedings concerning resolutions dated February 7th 2005 and February
9th 2005 are finished”, also transferred to Ms. Levy all the corporate powers and rights,
if she already had them as owner of the preferred shares.'°' Furthermore, in the
Respondent's submission the reference to “legal proceedings” must be read as a

reference to the future BIT proceedings.‘

ii. Direct shareholding in Gremcitel

The Respondent also disputes the accuracy and probative value of the documents

allegedly showing Ms. Levy’s acquisition of direct ownership in Gremcitel in 2007.

First, the Respondent contends that Gremcitel’s Shareholder Registry is inconsistent
with the Minutes of a Gremcitel Shareholders’ Meeting, which fail to record a number of
relevant share transfers.°° The Respondent further contends that the transfer of the
40,000 Gremcitel shares from Hart Industries to Ms. Levy did not comply with Peruvian
law. The Respondent submits that, among other alleged irregularities, Gremcitel’s
corporate documents record inconsistent dates of the transfer. The Respondent notes
that Hart Industries and Ms. Levy notified Gremcitel of the share transfer by way of a
letter dated 10 October 2007,’ whereas Gremcitel had already registered the transfer
the day before, on 9 October 2007.°5 For the Respondent, this is illogical and contrary
to Gremcitel’s own bylaws. 19°

Further, the Respondent submits that Gremcitel did not register in its books, nor report

to the tax authorities, the transfer of shares to Ms. Levy when the transfer allegedly

evidence of the Claimants’ abuse of process, on which see infra paragraph 175.

occurred.1°” The Respondent points in particular to a 2012 BDO report, which found that
for approximately two years — between January 2007 and December 2008 — Gremcitel’s
tax returns failed to mention that the shares had been transferred from Hart Industries to
Ms. Levy.'8 Only in March 2013, so notes the Respondent, did Gremcitel amend its tax
returns to reflect the transfer of shares of Gremcitel to Ms. Levy.1°° However, in the
correction, the transfer of shares was recorded to have occurred on yet another date, 7
October 2007,'"° i.e., two days before the Share Transfer Agreement between Ms. Levy
and Hart Industries’ and the entry in Gremcitel’s shareholder registry."2

108. The Respondent further argues that “Claimants failed to address [those alleged
inconsistencies and irregularities] at the hearing. Thus, Respondent's evidence and
arguments stand unrebutted, and the Tribunal should not rely on any of the documents
put forward by Claimants as evidence of an alleged 2007 investment by Ms. Levy in
Gremcitel”.119

109. In conclusion, the Respondent submits that based on the documents on record and
testimony at the Hearing, the Claimants have failed to prove either that Ms. Levy became

an indirect investor in Gremcitel in 2005 or a direct investor in Gremcitel in 2007.

110. Finally, the Respondent alleges that Ms. Levy has not proven “foreign control” over
Gremcitel for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) BIT.
Citing to ICSID cases Vacuum Salt v. Ghana, LETCO v. Liberia, and Caratube v.
Kazakhstan, the Respondent contends that ownership in a company is not per se
sufficient to meet the foreign control requirement, but that “actual control” is required,

something that Ms. Levy is not shown to have ever exerted.1"4

In the Respondent's submission, the dispute arose much earlier than the 2007 events
discussed above. It has proposed several possible dates.

The Respondent's general thesis is that the status of the Morro Solar as intangible and
historically valuable was established with the 1977 and 1986 Resolutions, the 2007
Resolution being a mere confirmation of the previous ones. For the Respondent, the
dispute over the status of the Morro Solar thus crystallized well before the Claimants
made their investment. In 1977 and 1986, the Claimants held no interest in the land or
the proposed project, Gremcitel having acquired the land from Gremco in 2003-2004 and
Ms. Levy's earliest involvement going back to 2005 when she allegedly acquired indirect
ownership over Gremcitel.1*® At the time of the 1977 and 1986 Resolutions, the
Respondent adds, not only were the Claimants not investors, but the France-Peru BIT
was not in force yet. The BIT entered into force on 30 May 1996 and thus the Tribunal
has no jurisdiction over this case. According to the Respondent, the conclusion that
disputes which predate the treaty’s entry into force are outside of a treaty’s temporal
scope of application, should also be confirmed in the absence of an express clause in
the BIT to this effect. The Respondent refers to ICSID case law and to the non-
retroactivity principle (as expressed in both the VCLT and the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility).1"°

Alternatively, the Respondent argues that the dispute arose no later than 2004, but likely
as early as 2001, when Gremco started disputing the land’s archeological and historical
delimitation.” The Respondent relies on the following events to show that there was a
dispute “long before Ms. Levy was allegedly injected into the corporate structure of
Gremcitel, either in 2005 or 2007”:1"8

e The 3 July 2001 “Proposal of Historical Delimitation — Morro Solar” submitted by
Gremco to the INC,""? which, in the Respondent's view, shows that Gremco was
requesting the INC to redefine the Morro Solar more narrowly (that is, as
encompassing only the so-called “Chorrillos Peak”), and thus from then on

“began disputing the land’s historical protection”.'2°

The May 2002 “Agreement of Cooperation Between INC and Gremco’”,'2" which
in the Respondent's submission represents an attempt by the INC and Gremco
to amicably resolve the “dispute” between the parties. 122

A number of subsequent exchanges between Gremco and/or Mr. Levy, on the
one side, and the INC, on the other,'23 in which Gremco contested the INC’s

position that the entire promontory should be protected.124

The 2004 creation of the Ad Hoc Commission to obtain an opinion on the Parties’
diverging views on the delimitation. The Respondent contends that, even if the
discussions within that framework were harmonious, the parties had opposing
views — i.e., they disagreed about the proper delimitation of the historical area of
the Morro Solar.176

The creation of the Historical Commission by the end of 2004, entrusted with the
task of proposing a delimitation of the historical area, which in the Respondent's
submissions shows that, by late 2004, the Levys knew that the INC still had not
adopted Gremco’s position on a narrow delimitation of the historical area of the
Morro Solar, and were on notice that the INC may issue a conclusive delimitation
of the historical area of the Morro Solar including Gremcitel’s land.126

The Claimants’ position

The Claimants have standing to bring this dispute under the ICSID
Convention and the BIT

The Claimants contend that they have standing to bring this dispute under the ICSID
Convention and the BIT. Ms. Levy is a French national and does not hold a Peruvian
nationality. Gremcitel is a Peruvian corporation which at the time when the dispute arose
was controlled by Ms. Levy. It thus qualifies as a French entity pursuant to Article
25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the BIT.12”

115. On the Tribunals jurisdiction ratione temporis, the Claimants emphasize that the BIT’s
dispute settlement clause refers to “any dispute relating to an investment”. Its text is
unambiguous: while it contains limitations ratione personae (“between a party and
national or company of the other Contracting Party”) and ratione materiae (“relating to
an investment”), it contains no restrictions related to time.'28 The Claimants argue that,
if the Contracting Parties to the BIT had intended to introduce a temporal limitation, they

could have said so."29

b. The dispute arose on the date of publication of the 2007 Resolution

116. In any event, in the Claimants’ submission the dispute arose on 18 October 2007 when
the 2007 Resolution was published in Peru’s Official Journal (Diario Oficial El
Peruano).**° On this date, the BIT was in force and Gremcitel was directly owned and

controlled by a French national (Ms. Levy).13"

117. For the Claimant, the previous resolutions and reports invoked by the Respondent
cannot be the true source for the dispute. The 1977 Resolution had an “urbanistic”
character (“caracter urbanistico”)'®2 and did not purport to have any “historical” value,
because the issuing body (the Ministry of Housing and Construction) had no authority in
this respect and because it was not based on historical methods. The fact that the 2007
Resolution does not refer to the 1977 Resolution in any way confirms that the latter is
not an "antecedent" of the former."

129 It is not entirely clear to the Tribunal what time limitations the Claimants had in mind. See C-PHB 1,
63 (“Si Peru y Francia hubieran querido introducir en el APRRI restricciones temporales tales como
la prohibicién de que el inversionista plantee controversias que estuvieran apoyadas en hechos o
actuaciones sucedidos antes de su ingreso en la inversion protegida, asi lo hubieran hecho”); C-PHB.

Francia no quisieron prohibir expresamente las controversias preexistentes con una clausula de
exclusién simple, ni controversias relacionadas con hechos que datan antes de la entrada del
inversionista extranjero en la inversion.”). But see C-Memorial, I] 27 (“En el presente caso, se acredita
a continuacion que nacionales franceses ejercieron control de la inversion en el Pert y que dicho control
en Gremcitel fue antes de los actos estatales denunciados”, emphasis added), 30 (“En ambos casos,

Temporis para acceder a la jurisdiccién del CIADI, if en relacion al en que
surgen los actos denunciados [...]", emphasis added). In light of the Tribunal's determination of the time
when the dispute arose, the limitations addressed in C-PHB 1, If] 63, 66 do not come into play whatever
they may be and, hence, the exact meaning of the Claimants’ argument can be left undecided.

118. With regard to the 1986 Resolution, the Claimants underscore the “declarative character”
of such resolution, which simply purported to include a list of “historical monuments”
without carrying out any delimitation of the protected areas. Also, the 1986 Resolution
does not make any reference to the 1977 Resolution.'*4 The Claimants also rely on other
documents to show that the dispute about the delimitation for historical reasons arose
only with the 2007 Resolution.*35

119. For the Claimants, it is clear that the dispute arose only with the 2007 Resolution because
only at that moment was there (i) a formal position by the INC signaling that specific
geographical coordinates constituted the delimitation of the intangible historic area of the
Morro Solar (which included Gremcitel’s land); (ii) a formal position by Gremcitel
opposing the INC’s determination; and (iii) the communication between the two parties

of their antagonistic positions.1%°

120. All the exchanges between Gremco and the Peruvian authorities up to the 2007
Resolution should be viewed as evidencing normal relations of coordination, without
conflicts or differences of positions.'2” This is also the case of the 2002 Agreement on
Cooperation, which was based on the collaboration of both Parties (and can thus not be
viewed as an act giving rise to a dispute).1%® Moreover, the exchanges which occurred
thereafter between the parties should be considered as “proposals” within the framework

of the Cooperation Agreement with a view to arriving at an agreed delimitation.1%°

121.

With regard to the Ad Hoc Commission’s Report of 2004, the Claimants underscore that
its nature was that of a recommendation, which is thus insusceptible of constituting a
state’s antagonistic position required for the existence of a dispute.'4° Thus, the fact that
Ms. Levy became a shareholder of Hart Industries a few months after the institution of
the Historical Commission in 2005 is irrelevant, because the creation of such
Commission was part of the execution of the Cooperation Agreement and its Report

could not bind the INC, which was the exclusive authority competent to proceed with the

delimitation.147

Similarly, the Claimants underscore that also the Historical Commission’s findings were
issued in the form of a recommendation, and were thus incapable of creating a definitive
position on the part of the State.'4? Further, the Historical Commission’s Report of 2005
was a purely internal document, which was never communicated to either Gremco or
Gremcitel. The Claimants contend that they acquired knowledge of this document only
through the 2007 Resolution. Finally, the argument that Mr. Cock, one of the Claimants’
consultants and witnesses, had knowledge of the Resolution through its contacts at the
INC is, in the Claimants’ view, entirely speculative.143

In conclusion, according to the Claimants, it is only the formal act taken through the 2007

Resolution that gave rise to the dispute between the Parties."4*

c. Ms. Levy has owned Gremcitel indirectly since 2005 and directly since 2007

The Claimants contend that Ms. Levy validly acquired indirect shareholding in Gremcitel
in 2005 (through ownership of Hart Industries) (i) and direct shareholding in Gremcitel in
2007 (ii).

i. Indirect shareholding in Gremcitel

The Claimants accept that the shares in Hart Industries were transferred to Ms. Levy in
2005 without compensation, but emphasize that the transfer was part of an intra-family
corporate reorganization in accordance with the decisions of Isy’s and Renée’s father,
David Levy.'45 The Claimants point to the minutes of the Levy Group meeting of 15 July
2005, which record that Ms. Levy would assume the presidency of the Group’s meetings
from then on."* Thereafter, according to the Claimants Ms. Levy was an active
participant in the operations of Gremcitel, as can be seen from the minutes of the Levy
Group meetings in the years 2005, 2006, 2007."4”

With regard to the three Hart Industries corporate resolutions (of 7 February, 9 February
and 7 March 2005 respectively), the Claimants rebut the Respondent's objections as
follows:

First, with regard to the Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 7 February 2005, the
Claimants contend that, unlike what the Respondent and its expert, Ms. Harris, argue,
this resolution is valid and the validity is not affected by the fact that it was not registered
as required under Grenadian law. According to the Claimants, the object of this
resolution was not to modify Hart Industries’ Memorandum of Association or its Articles
of Association, but to divide the existing shares in different classes. For that purpose, it
was not necessary to proceed to such amendment, because Article 7(3) of the
Memorandum of Association provided that the shares are divided in such number and
classes as determined by the Directors.@ In the Claimants’ submission, this is what
happened through said resolution, which thus complied with the applicable corporate
norms and Grenadian law, and did not constitute an amendment or modification of the
corporate norms."49

Second, with regard to the Hart Industries corporate resolution dated 9 February 2005,
the Claimants contend that the Respondent's position that the transfer of shares
occurred (or is likely to have occurred) after the date indicated in the document is entirely
speculative.'°° With regard to Ms. Joseph’s testimony, the Claimants argue that it was
sufficient for her to acknowledge that the person appearing before her would attest that
the date appearing on the document was the one in which the person executed the
document."

Furthermore, in the Claimants’ view, this resolution should not be viewed in isolation, but
in conjunction with other documents which attest that the transfer of the shares effectively
occurred in 2005.12

In any event, the Claimants submit that in accordance with Grenadian law, corporate

resolutions need not be notarized in order to be valid."®

Third, in connection with the Hart Industries corporate resolution of 7 March 2005, the
Claimants do not accept that the reference to “legal proceedings” in such resolution is a
reference to the future ICSID proceedings. Referring to the testimony of Ms. Joseph, the
Claimants submit that the term “legal proceedings” should not be interpreted strictly.
Because the resolution was drafted by Mr. Levy, who is not familiar with the laws of
Grenada, the reference to “legal proceedings” should be interpreted widely (as meaning

proceedings in general, including administrative and notary)."54

ii. Direct shareholding in Gremcitel

With regard to the 2007 transfer of Gremcitel shares to Ms. Levy, the Claimants contend
that such transfer was carried out following all applicable legal requirements." The
Claimants note that Gremcitel’s other shareholders were notified of the intended transfer
in September 2007, and asked whether they wished to exercise their right of first
refusal.'° As can be seen from those letters, the transfer was set in motion (through the
request to the shareholders to exercise such right) as of 4 September 2007, which
renders the Respondent's argument on the transfer having occurred “the day before the
issuance of 2007 Resolution” untenable.'*’ Furthermore, as in the case of the 2005
transfer, the Levy Group Meeting Minutes evidence, according to the Claimants,
Ms. Levy's active participation in Gremcitel both before and after the issuance of the
2007 Resolution. 1°

The Claimants further rely on the 2012 BDO report referred to earlier,'®° which found as

follows:

“During the period January 1, 2007-December 31, 2008, the transfer of
40,000 shares from Hart Industries to Renée Rose Levi was not registered
in the accounting records. Also, the sworn statement filed with the tax
authorities in 2007 does not mention the names or the shareholding of the
main shareholders."

The audit report recommended to file a “Sworn Statement of Correction” to rectify the
missing transfer of shares and the correct names of the shareholders.**1 As a
consequence thereof, the Claimants note that on 13 March 2013, Gremcitel filed with the
tax authorities “Sworn Statements of Corrections” to rectify the details concerning its
shareholding, ‘© and on 15 March 2013 Gremcitel’s Shareholders’ Meeting implemented
the audit's recommendations."® As a result of those corrections, the Claimants contend
that there is no contradiction in the corporate documents as to the shareholders nor any
doubt as to the veracity of the information provided in relation to Ms. Levy's ownership

in Gremcitel.1®

Analysis
a. _ Relevant issues

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that Gremcitel is both a claimant in its own name through
the mechanism of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the BIT,
and part of Ms. Levy's alleged investment under Article 1(1)(b) (which comprises shares
in a company constituted in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties). Although, as
will be seen, the resolution of the issues relating to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione
personae and ratione temporis over Ms. Levy and Gremcitel requires addressing facts
which are closely intertwined with each other, for the sake of clarity the Tribunal deems
it appropriate to first set out the requirements which each of the two Claimants must fulfill

under the ICSID Convention and the BIT to have the standing to bring this arbitration.
Ms. Levy must fulfill the following jurisdictional requirements:

a. Under Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, Ms. Levy must be a national of
one of the ICSID Contracting States on the dates she consented to submit the
dispute to arbitration and when the request for arbitration was registered under
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. She must not be a Peruvian national on

either one of these dates.

b. Under Article 1(1) of the BIT, Ms. Levy must fulfill the definition of “national”, i.e.,
she must be a French national.

Exh. C-117; R-307).

163 See Gremcitel’s Shareholders’ Meeting Minutes, 15 March 2013 (part of Exh. C-117;
Exh. R-305).

164 C-Reply, 9] 35.

43

137. While in principle these propositions are uncontroversial, it is a matter of contention
whether, in addition, Ms. Levy had to own or control her investment on a critical date.

138. In turn, the following jurisdictional requirements must be met for Gremcitel to bring claims

in its own name:
a. Under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention:

i. Gremcitel “had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute” on

the date of consent;

ii. “the parties have agreed [that it] should be treated as a national of another
Contracting State for the purposes of [the ICSID Convention]’;

“because of foreign control”.

i

Under Article 8(3) of the BIT, Gremcitel was controlled by a national of the other
Contracting Party (i.e., a French national) on a critical date (“antes del surgimiento
de la controversia” in the Spanish version of the Treaty; “avant que le différend ne
soit soulevé’ in the French version).

139. With these issues in mind, the Tribunal will now address whether Ms. Levy (b. below)
and Gremcitel (c. below) fulfill the requirements ratione personae and temporis under the
ICSID Convention and the BIT. By contrast, the Tribunal will not deal in this context with
the requirement of the existence of an “investment” under Articles 25 of the ICSID
Convention and 1 of the BIT, as this issue is the subject of a separate jurisdictional

objection.

b. Whether Ms. Levy fulfills the requirements ratione personae and temporis
under the ICSID Convention and the BIT
140. It is undisputed that Ms. Levy is a French national and that she held French nationality
on both dates set forth in Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, i.e., the date of
consent and the date of registration of the request for arbitration. It is further undisputed
that she is not a Peruvian national. It is equally common ground that Ms. Levy fulfills the
definition of “national” under Article 1(2) of the BIT.16

141.

The Parties disagree, however, on whether Ms. Levy had to own and control her

investment on a certain date under the BIT. The relevant question is on which date a

165 The Tribunal notes that the BIT does not refer to an “investor”, but rather speaks of a “national” or a
“company” (see the BIT provisions quoted supra at paragraphs 81-84). Thus, the Tribunal understands
the Respondent's references to the Claimants not being “investors” under the BIT to mean
nationals/companies who have made an investment or who own/control an investment, depending on
the context.

44

142.

143.

144.

145.

“national” or “company”, as defined in Article 1 of the BIT, must have acquired its
investment in order to be entitled to claim under the BIT. As stated above, while the
Respondent contends that Ms. Levy must show that she owned or controlled her
investment “when the event about which she complains occurred”, the Claimants argue
that the BIT contemplates no such temporal limitation.1©

The Tribunal starts by recalling the principles that govern treaty interpretation. According
to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty “shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with
the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light
of its object and purpose”. The “ordinary meaning” of the text must be ascertained in the
light of the context and the treaty’s object and purpose, any subsequent agreement or
practice of the Contracting Parties related to the interpretation of the treaty, and any other
relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Contracting
Parties.167

The jurisdiction of the Tribunal derives from Article 8 of the BIT, which provides that “[a]ny
dispute relating to an investment between of the Contracting Parties and a national or a
company of the other Contracting Party” shall be submitted to ICSID arbitration. The
dispute settlement clause does not expressly elucidate at what time a national or
company must have acquired their investment to have the right to bring an arbitration
under the BIT.

It is true that Article 8(3) and Article 1(1) of the BIT provide certain temporal indications.
They are however unhelpful for the purpose of the present question. Article 8(3), which
will be analyzed below when dealing with Gremcitel’s standing, is only applicable to
locally incorporated companies under foreign control. As concerns Article 1(1), second
paragraph, this provision reads as follows:

“Said assets must be or have been invested, in accordance with the

legislation of the Contracting Party in the territory or maritime area in which

the investment is effected, before or after the entry into force of the present
Treaty”.1°

This provision clarifies that an investment may have been made either before or after the

entry into force of the Treaty. It does not say, however, whether the “national” or

166 See supra paragraphs 92, 114-115.
187 Article 31 of the VCLT.
168 Article 1(1), second sentence, of the BIT (Tribunal’s translation).

45

“company” must have acquired its investment before the treaty breach occurred for the
Tribunal to have ratione temporis jurisdiction."®°

146. Despite the lack of an explicit answer to this question in the Treaty, it is clear to the
Tribunal that, where the claim is founded upon an alleged breach of the Treaty’s
substantive standards, a tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to a dispute between the host
state and a national or company which has acquired its protected investment before the
alleged breach occurred. In other words, the Treaty must be in force and the national or
company must have already made its investment when the alleged breach occurs, for
the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over a breach of that Treaty's substantive standards
affecting that investment.

147. This conclusion follows from the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties,17° which entails
that the substantive protections of the BIT apply to the state conduct that occurred after
these protections became applicable to the eligible investment. Because the BIT is at
the same time the instrument that creates the substantive obligation forming the basis of
the claim before the Tribunal and the instrument that confers jurisdiction upon the
Tribunal, a claimant bringing a claim based on a Treaty obligation must have owned or
controlled the investment when that obligation was allegedly breached.‘71

entered into force and Claimant, as a French company, acquired the investment and it became a French
investment. Accordingly, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over acts and events that took place before the
Claimant acquired the investment, that is on 12 November 2004, at which time both the Treaty had
entered into force and the investor had become a qualifying French national.”); GEA Group

148. Consequently, the BIT’s substantive protection which Ms. Levy invokes started applying
to her when she made an investment and not before. She must therefore prove that she

had already acquired her investment at the time of the impugned conduct.

149. The determination of the critical date is thus essential for the assessment of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis.'’? In the Tribunal’s view, the critical date is the
one on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even when the measure
represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have started
years earlier. It is not uncommon that divergences or disagreements develop over a
period of time before they finally “crystallize” in an actual measure affecting the investor's

treaty rights.

150. Here, the disagreements between the Parties find their origin in earlier events, in
particular, in the Historical Commission’s creation and its 2005 Report, which formed the
basis for the subsequent 2007 Resolution. However, it was only when the 2007
Resolution was adopted and published that the rights of the Claimants were allegedly
affected. Only at this moment were the precise boundaries of the Morro Solar’s
intangible area determined through a binding administrative act. Furthermore, prior to
the enactment of the 2007 Resolution, there was still a possibility that the INC would
decide not to adopt the Resolution. The Claimants would then have had no act to
complain about. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that Ms. Levy was to have acquired her
investment by the date of the 2007 Resolution, more precisely by the date of the latter's
publication in the Official Journal, i.e., 18 October 2007.

held an interest in the alleged investment before the alleged treaty violations were committed.”). See
also recently, confirming the same approach, ST-AD GmbH v. Bulgaria, Award on Jurisdiction, 18 July
2013, 300 (‘It is an uncontested principle that a tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione temporis to consider
claims arising prior to the date of the alleged investment, since a BIT cannot be applied to acts committed
by a State before the claimant invested in the host country. [...] According to the well-known principle of
non-retroactivity of treaties in international law, a BIT cannot apply to the protection of an investor before
the latter indeed became an investor under said BIT”). See also Zachary Douglas, The International Law
of Investment Claims (Cambridge, 2009), {J 330 (“The act of making a qualified investment is also
controlling for the scope of the arbitral tribunal's adjudicative power in several respects. [...] the timing
of the investor's acquisition of its investment determines the commencement of the substantive
protection afforded by the investment treaty and hence the temporal scope for the tribunal’s adjudicative
power over claims based upon an investment treaty obligation.”).

1? The Parties have discussed the issue of the critical date by sometimes referring interchangeably to
“the moment where the challenged acts occur” and the moment “when the dispute arises”, possibly
because the latter is the moment expressly contemplated by Article 8(3) of the BIT with respect to the
time at which a locally incorporated company must be under foreign control, an issue to which the
Tribunal will revert later. As noted infra at paragraphs 167-168, the moment when an alleged breach of
the treaty occurs is not necessarily the same as the moment in which the dispute arises.

154.

Having determined the critical date, the Tribunal will next address whether Ms. Levy
owned or controlled her investment in Gremcitel before 18 October 2007, be it directly

or indirectly.

The Claimants argue that Ms. Levy acquired an indirect interest in Gremcitel in 2005
through the acquisition of shares in Hart Industries. Upon review of the documentary
evidence and testimony at the Hearing, the Tribunal cannot agree with this proposition.
The documents proffered by the Claimants to prove this acquisition are so full of
inconsistencies that they cannot be relied upon to establish that a transfer actually took

place on the alleged date.

The Tribunal starts by noting that the amendment of the Articles of Association of Hart
Industries was not registered in Grenada, which affects the effectiveness under
Grenadian law of the subsequent transfer of shares to Ms. Levy made pursuant to such
amendment. The Respondent's expert on Grenadian law, Ms. Sheila Harris, testified
that without such registration the resolution would be ineffective according to Grenadian
law.'73 The Claimants decided not to cross-examine Ms. Harris (despite having called
her).'74 The Tribunal has no reason to doubt the expertise of Ms. Harris and the veracity
of her testimony.

More importantly (and even if, contrary to what the Tribunal believes, the amendment of
the Articles of Association were effective), the evidence addressed at the Hearing
established that the dates shown on the relevant corporate resolutions cannot be relied
upon. The Claimants’ expert, Ms. Joseph, who is also the notary public who certified
(“acknowledged”) the signatures appearing on the resolution, admitted that she did not
see the 9 February 2005 resolution on 7 February 2005 as she had initially stated in the
resolution. She also conceded not having been presented with the resolution on 9
February 2005, as she had certified in her undated, hand written “rectification” made on
the resolution. In fact, Ms. Joseph admitted that in 2010, i.e., five years after the alleged
transfer of the shares and three years after the enactment of the 2007 Resolution, she
backdated the notarization of the 9 February 2005 resolution upon request of Mr. Isy
Levy.175 She also admitted that “sometime after April 2012”, i.e., when the ICSID

proceedings had already started, she acceded to a further request by Mr. Levy that she

“correct” her initial backdated notarization to make it consistent with the date when the
document was allegedly executed.’”© Thus, Ms. Joseph backdated the document a
second time, this time however to a different date (9 February instead of 7 February
2005).

It is clear that the Tribunal cannot attach any probative value to documents of this kind.
In light of Ms. Joseph’s own admissions, it is thus impossible to ascertain when the
resolutions documenting the alleged 2005 transfer were created. Pondering all the
circumstances, it seems likely to the Tribunal that they were created well after 2005.
Under these circumstances, the Tribunal has no hesitation in concluding that the
Claimants have not discharged their burden to prove their assertion that Ms. Levy

acquired indirect control over Gremcitel in 2005.17”

It is the Claimants’ further submission that Ms. Levy became a direct shareholder in
Gremcitel in 2007. For the following reasons, the Tribunal is satisfied that this second
transfer effectively occurred before the critical date, i.e., before 18 October 2007.

First, the Tribunal notes that the transfer process of the Gremcitel shares from Hart
Industries to Ms. Levy was set in motion through a number of letters sent by Gremcitel
to its shareholders between 4 September to 8 September 2007, following a letter from
Hart Industries to Gremcitel notifying Gremcitel of its intention to sell its shares to Ms.
Levy.178 In subsequent letters, Gremcitel asked its shareholders whether they wished to
exercise their right of first refusal over the shares. These letters are notarized and the
Respondent has not questioned their authenticity or reliability. The Tribunal thus accepts

the probative value of these letters.

Second, the share transfer agreement for the 40,000 Gremcitel shares was concluded
between Ms. Levy and Hart Industries on 9 October 2007.12 There are no facts on
record casting doubts on the validity of this agreement.

Third, the sale of the shares was registered on Gremcitel’s shareholder's registry on 9
October 2007.'8° For the exclusive purpose of its inquiry on its jurisdiction ratione

178 See Tr. (Joseph), at 754: 17 to 757: 18.

177 Furthermore, the Tribunal does not deem the so-called “Levy Group” minutes to be reliable evidence
to prove the Claimants’ standing. Because this entity is a private organization, its book does not require,
by the Claimants’ own admission, to be notarized. See Claimants’ Letter to Respondent Regarding
Document Production, 19 March 2013 (Exh. R-252), Request No. 4, p. 4.

temporis, the Tribunal does not attach weight to the fact that the registration occurred
one day before Gremcitel was formally notified of the transfer.'®1 Because of the intra-
family nature of the transaction, it is reasonable to assume that Gremcitel learned of the
transfer on 9 October 2007 and immediately proceeded with the registration in the
shareholder's registry, whereas the formal notification occurred one day later. While this
circumstance has no impact on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis, it evinces that
the Claimants acted as if they were pressed by time, a matter to which the Tribunal will
revert in its assessment of the abuse of process.

Finally, the Tribunal does not consider that the allegations of fiscal irregularities
connected with the 2007 transfer and the related evidence are such that they change its
conclusion about the validity of the transfer. In particular, the Respondent's reliance on
the report dated 5 March 20128? and on the Sworn Statements of Corrections to
Gremcitel’s Annual Income Tax Return for 2007 and 2008, dated 13 March 2013,'® are,
in the Tribunal’s view, inconclusive, as they could be explained in various ways not
calling into question the fact that Ms. Levy became a majority shareholder of Gremcitel
on 9 October 2007.

The Tribunal thus concludes that, based on the evidence in the record, Ms. Levy has not
established that she acquired her indirect shareholding in Gremcitel in 2005. By contrast,
she has discharged her burden to prove that she acquired her direct shareholding in
Gremcitel on 9 October 2007, i.e., shortly before the challenged act occurred on 18
October 2007. For these reasons, and without prejudice to the Tribunal’s later findings
on abuse of process, the Tribunal concludes that Ms. Levy has satisfied the requirements

ratione personae and ratione temporis under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.

this Convention."** Under Article 8(3) of the BIT, a juridical person constituted in the
territory of one of the two Contracting Parties and which — in the original treaty languages
- “antes del surgimiento de la controversia’ or “avant que le différend ne soit soulevé’ is
controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party, shall be considered,
for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, as a company of the other
Contracting Party. Accordingly, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction ratione personae and
temporis over Gremcitel, the latter must establish (i) that it is a Peruvian company, (ii)
which on the critical date (iii) was under foreign control, and that (iv) there is an

agreement to treat it as foreign. The Tribunal will review these four elements in turn.

In respect of the first requirement, the Tribunal notes that Gremcitel is a company
incorporated in the Contracting State party to the dispute, i.e., Peru. In this respect, the
Tribunal also notes that it held such nationality on the date of consent, i.e., when the
request for arbitration was filed, as the ICSID Convention requires.'®>

Second, the Tribunal must ascertain the critical date as set forth in the BIT. Article 8(3)
of the BIT mentions "antes surgimiento de la controversia" and "avant que le différend
ne soit soulevé". At the Hearing, the Tribunal inquired about potential differences in the
Spanish and French versions of Article 8(3) of the BIT and invited the Parties to present
their views in their post-hearing briefs.8 Only the Respondent addressed this issue in

its post-hearing submissions.

Both versions of the BIT are authentic.'®” In accordance with Article 33 of the VCLT on
the interpretation of multilingual treaties, the terms of the treaty are presumed to have
the same meaning in each authentic text.‘88 Furthermore, when a comparison of the
authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application of Article 31 and
32 of the VCLT does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts must be
adopted, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty.18°

The Spanish version of the BIT (“antes del surgimiento de la controversia’) has only one
possible meaning, which is “before the emergence of the dispute”. By contrast, the

French version of the Treaty (“avant que le différend ne soit soulevé’) could have two

184 Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

185 The Tribunal notes that the critical date specified in Article 25(2)(b), 2"! sentence, of the ICSID
Convention (“on that date”) relates to “the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute”. The
question as to whether this is also the critical date with respect to “foreign control” can be left open, as
the answer is not outcome-determinative and the Parties have not specifically dealt with this question.

meanings, that is, either “before the dispute is brought before an international arbitral
tribunal” or “before the dispute is raised with the other side”. The Tribunal agrees with
the Respondent that the only harmonious interpretation of the two authentic texts is to
say that the locally incorporated company must be under foreign control “before the
dispute is raised with the other side”. Indeed, this understanding coincides with the

Spanish wording and with one of the two meanings of the French formula.

167. Third, it must be asked whether Gremcitel was under French control before the dispute
emerged, or, differently put, whether Ms. Levy acquired control over Gremcitel before
that date. The issue has largely been dealt with above when addressing the issue of Ms.
Levy's own standing as claimant, when it was inquired whether she acquired her
investment at the time the challenged acts occurred. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal
wishes to note that, in theory, the moment when the challenged acts occurred is not
necessarily the same as the one when the dispute arose - the latter being the moment
which Article 8(3) of the BIT expressly contemplates. It has rightly been noted that ““[t]he
time of the dispute is not identical with the time of the events leading to the dispute. By
definition, the incriminated acts must have occurred some time before the dispute”.12 In
the Tribunal’s view, a breach or violation does not become a “dispute” until the injured

party identifies the breach or violation and objects to it.19"

168. In this case, the Claimants have accepted 18 October 2007 as the date on which the
dispute arose, which shows that they themselves considered that they were in dispute
with the Respondent from that time on. Starting then there was “a disagreement on a
point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties”,1°? and the
Claimants considered their claim to be “positively opposed”? by Peru. The Tribunal will
therefore regard 18 October 2007 as the date when the dispute arose for the purposes
of Article 8(3) of the BIT.

169. The facts surrounding Ms. Levy's control over Gremcitel on the relevant date have

already been discussed in the context of Ms. Levy’s standing and need not be repeated

here.1% The Tribunal has concluded that, while the Claimants did not prove that
Gremcitel was under Ms. Levy’s control in 2005, they have established that the company

was under her control in 2007.

170. The Tribunal thus finds that the requirement of “foreign control” under both Article
25(2)(b) of the ICSID and Article 8(3) of the BIT is satisfied in this case.

171.

The Respondent raised the additional issue whether “foreign control” under Article
25(2)(b) and Article 8(3) of the BIT requires actual control. The Tribunal notes that
neither Article 25(2)(b), 2"? sentence, nor Article 8(3) of the BIT specify that actual or
effective control is required. The Tribunal considers that Ms. Levy acquired the majority
of the shares in Gremcitel on 9 October 2007. In the present circumstances, and without
excluding whether in other instances an inquiry as to the “effectiveness” of the control
may be warranted, the Tribunal considers Ms. Levy's ownership of the shares sufficient
to establish “foreign control” under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article
8(3) of the BIT.195

172. Fourth and last, Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention requires an agreement to “treat[]
[the locally incorporated company] as a national of another Contracting State for the
purposes of this Convention”. It is undisputed that such agreement is found in Article
8(3) of the BIT.

173. In conclusion, Gremcitel fulfills the requirements ratione personae and temporis pursuant
to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 8(3) of the BIT.

D. SECOND OBJECTION: THE INVESTMENT IS AN ABUSE OF PROCESS

1. The Respondent's position

174. As a second jurisdictional objection, Peru invokes an abuse of process. Even if the
Claimants’ documents concerning Ms. Levy's investment were reliable, it submits that
Ms. Levy was inserted into Gremcitel’s ownership structure for no purpose other than to
obtain BIT protection due to her French nationality, at a time when the dispute had
already arisen or was at least foreseeable. Because Ms. Levy acquired her alleged
interest in Gremcitel for the sole purpose of internationalizing an otherwise purely

domestic dispute, her investment is abusive. Citing ICSID cases Phoenix v. Czech

194 See supra paragraphs 151-160.

195 See also Aguas del Tunari SA v. Republic of Bolivia, \CSID Case No. ARB/02/3, Decision on

ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001, § 110 (“Article 25(2)(b) [of the ICSID

Republic, Pac Rim v. El Salvador, and Tidewater v. Venezuela, the Respondent posits
that an abuse of process occurs where a domestic company restructures its ownership

to internationalize an existing or foreseeable dispute.'°

As already explained, the Respondent's position is that the dispute arose no later than
2004 and likely before.1*7 However, it agrees that even if the dispute arose later, the
Claimants restructured the corporate ownership at a time - from 2005 onwards - when
the dispute was “within the[ir] reasonable contemplation”.'°° Indeed, the INC had set up
the Historical Commission a few months before and the outcome of the process was
expected. The Respondent finds further evidence of an abuse of process in Hart
Industries’ corporate resolution of 7 March 2005, which states that Isy Levy Calvo and
Jacques Levy Calvo decide to transfer all political powers and rights to direct the
Company to Renée Rose Levy de Levi “until all legal proceedings concerning resolutions
dated February 7th 2005 and February 9th 2005 are finished’ .'°° The Respondent takes

the reference to “legal proceedings” to mean the future BIT proceedings.

Hence, according to the Respondent, the only reason why the Claimants injected Ms.
Levy into the ownership structure of Gremcitel was her French nationality. The
Respondent insists that Mr. Levy was unable to provide any business rationale for the
alleged 2005 transfer of Hart Industries shares to his sister. Mr. Levy's only explanation
for the transfer was that it was his father’s decision.2 There was no business rationale
either, so says the Respondent, behind the 2007 transfer of Gremcitel shares to Ms.
Levy.2°" Finally, the Respondent argues that it is more than likely that Mr. Cock, one of
the Claimants’ consultants and witnesses, learned of the INC’s impending resolution
through his “connections at the INC” and that Gremcitel responded by introducing Ms.
Levy directly into the ownership structure to benefit from the BIT protection.2°2

The Claimants’ position

The Claimants deny any allegations of abuse of process. They submit that an allegation

of abuse of process must meet a high standard involving proof of bad faith,2°? which the

Respondent does not meet. Furthermore, before the 2007 Resolution was issued, it
could not be foreseen that a delimitation of the protected area of the Morro Solar would
be ordered that would include Gremcitel’s land.2 The Claimants point to an internal
INC document dated 10 October 2007,7°° which mentions that the boundaries proposed
by the Historical Commission had not been adopted. They note that this internal
document was issued on 10 October 2007, but was “presented/submitted only on 15
October 2007” (“fue emitido el 10 de Octubre de 2007, pero presentado recién el 15 de
Octubre”). Thus, they note that "only the civil servant who drafted this memo could

foresee the promulgation of RD 1342".206

For the Claimants, the Respondent has not established that the Claimants had foreseen
the event which gave rise to the dispute, i.e., the issuance of the 2007 Resolution.
Hence, it has not shown that the Claimants manipulated Gremcitel’s nationality to gain
access to ICSID.”°” In this respect, the Claimants point to the tribunal's statement in Pac
Rim that “the dividing line occurs when the relevant party can see an actual dispute or
can foresee a specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a
possible controversy”, which in their view is not the case here.2°8

Rather, the 2007 transfer of the shares was set in motion already on 4 September 2007
with the notification of the intended transfer to the other shareholders.”°° It was due to
good faith family reasons at a time where the occurrence of the critical fact negatively
affecting the investment was unforeseeable.?"° Therefore, in the Claimants’ submission,

the Respondent has failed to establish that an abuse of process has occurred.

Analysis

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Parties have not expressly discussed the
characterization of this objection. Is it a matter of jurisdiction, admissibility, or something
else? The Respondent has grouped all of its objections, including this one, under one
single heading being either “Jurisdictional Objections’2"’ or “Jurisdiction/Abuse of

Process”?'2. The Claimants, in turn, have discussed abuse of process, in at least one of

their memorials, under a heading entitled “Admissibility’.27 As noted, neither Party has
engaged in a detailed discussion of the nature of the abuse of process objection. Both
have rather focused on the legal test required to find an abuse, and above all, on the

facts of the dispute.

181.

The Tribunal considers that the characterization of the abuse of process objection as a
jurisdictional or as an admissibility issue can be left open in the present case. Under the
circumstances of this dispute, such differentiation is, to use the words of the Pac Rim
tribunal, “a distinction without a difference”,?"4 in the sense that it would have no impact

on the outcome of the case.

182. As a further threshold matter, the Tribunal considers that an abuse of process objection
must be distinguished from a ratione temporis objection.2'> If a claimant acquires an
investment after the date on which the challenged act occurred, the tribunal will normally
lack jurisdiction ratione temporis and there will be no room for an abuse of process. Here,
the Tribunal has established that Ms. Levy acquired her investment prior to the
challenged measure, even if it was just slightly before. In such a situation, a tribunal has
jurisdiction ratione temporis but may be precluded from exercising its jurisdiction if the
acquisition is abusive.

183. In the context of investor-state arbitration, arbitral tribunals have indeed applied the
doctrine of abuse of process (or abuse of rights) in cases involving disputed corporate
restructurings. In particular, in Phoenix Action v. The Czech Republic, the ICSID tribunal
put emphasis on the objectives of investment protection:

“[...] the Claimant's initiation and pursuit of this arbitration is an abuse of the
system of international ICSID investment arbitration. If it were accepted that
the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide Phoenix's claim, then any pre-existing
national dispute could be brought to an ICSID tribunal by a transfer of the
national economic interests to a foreign company in an attempt to seek

Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, {J 2.10. (“the Tribunal has noted that the
Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on Abuse of Process by the Claimant does not, in legal
theory, operate as a bar to the existence of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction; but, rather, as a bar to the exercise
of that jurisdiction, necessarily assuming jurisdiction to exist. For present purposes, the Tribunal
considers this to be a distinction without a difference”).

215 See Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador, \CSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the
Respondent's Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012, ff] 2.101, 2.107 (distinguishing between a ratione
temporis objection and an abuse of process objection). See also recently, confirming this approach, Lao
Holdings NV. v. The Lao People's Democratic Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, Decision on
Jurisdiction, 21 February 2014, {| 76 (“if a company changes its nationality in order to gain ICSID
jurisdiction at a moment when things have started to deteriorate so that a dispute is highly probable, it
can be considered an abuse of process, but for an objection based on ratione temporis to be upheld,
the dispute has to have actually arisen before the critical date to conform to the general principle of non-
retroactivity in the interpretation and application of international treaties”, bold omitted).

56

protections under a BIT. Such transfer from the domestic arena to the
international scene would ipso facto constitute a “protected investment” —
and the jurisdiction of BIT and ICSID tribunals would be virtually unlimited.
It is the duty of the Tribunal not to protect such an abusive manipulation of
the system of international investment protection under the ICSID
Convention and the BITs. It is indeed the Tribunal's view that to accept
jurisdiction in this case would go against the basic objectives underlying the
ICSID Convention as well as those of bilateral investment treaties. The
Tribunal has to ensure that the ICSID mechanism does not protect
investments that it was not designed for to protect, because they are in
essence domestic investments disguised as international investments for
the sole purpose of access to this mechanism.”21°

184. In the Tribunal’s view, it is now well-established, and rightly so, that an organization or
reorganization of a corporate structure designed to obtain investment treaty benefits is
not illegitimate per se, including where this is done with a view to shielding the investment
from possible future disputes with the host state. Or, in the words of the Tidewater

tribunal,

“it is a perfectly legitimate goal, and no abuse of an investment protection
treaty regime, for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of
future disputes with a host state in this way”.2"7

185. However, a restructuring carried out with the intention to invoke the treaty’s protections
at a time when the dispute is foreseeable may constitute an abuse of process depending
on the circumstances.?'® In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the test suggested in
Pac Rim whereby “a specific future dispute” must be “foresee[able] [...] as a very high
probability and not merely as a possible controversy”.2'° In the Tribunal’s view, this test

claimant's nationality was made in good faith before the occurrence of any event or measure giving rise
to a later dispute, that restructuring should not be considered as an abuse of process.”).

218 As clarified supra at paragraph 182, if a claimant acquires an investment after the date on which the
challenged act occurred (or, a fortiori, when the dispute arose, see supra paragraph 167), the tribunal
will normally lack jurisdiction ratione temporis and there will be no room for an abuse of process.

strikes a fair balance between the need to safeguard an investor’s right to invoke a BIT’s
protection in the context of a legitimate corporate restructuring and the need to deny

protection to abusive conduct.

186. As for any abuse of right, the threshold for a finding of abuse of process is high, as a
court or tribunal will obviously not presume an abuse,?” and will affirm the evidence of
an abuse only “in very exceptional circumstances”.22"_ Furthermore, as the Tribunal in
Mobil v. Venezuela stated, “[u]nder general international law as well as under ICSID case
law, abuse of right is to be determined in each case, taking into account all the

circumstances of the case”.?22

187. Having thus set out the principles which will guide its decision, the Tribunal starts by
assessing whether the present dispute was foreseeable as a very high probability, and
not as a mere possibility, at the time when Ms. Levy acquired Gremcitel. It is clear that
the closer the acquisition of the investment is to the act giving rise to the dispute, the
higher the degree of foreseeability will normally be.

188. In this case, the Tribunal has found that the events giving rise to the dispute occurred on
18 October 2007.23 The acts that set in motion Ms. Levy's investment in Gremcitel
occurred just about over a month before, when the letters notifying the other
shareholders of their right of first refusal were sent. The actual transfer of the shares
occurred on 9 October 2007, only one day before the 2007 Resolution was issued and
9 days before it was published. A review of the record shows that such striking proximity
of events is not a coincidence.

189. To the contrary, if one reviews the unfolding of events which led to the 2007 Resolution,
it is clear that the Claimants could foresee that the 2007 Resolution was forthcoming. In

when the claimants commenced their restructuring] or in March 2008 when the restructuring was
consummated, that such a nationalization was imminent’, and found that “the acts of expropriation that
give rise to the present dispute were not reasonably foreseeable by the Claimants either in December
2008 when they began restructuring, or in March 2009 when the restructuring took effect”, emphasis

2005, the Historical Commission issued the report, on which the delimitation
implemented through the 2007 Resolution was largely based. Although the 2005 Report
was never officially communicated to the Claimants, and the Claimants assert that they
only became aware of it when the 2007 Resolution was issued, /.e., two and a half years
later,224 Mr. Isy Levy admitted at the Hearing that he knew that the Historical Commission
had been created “at the end of 2004”.225 More importantly, Mr. Guillermo Cock, one of
the Claimants’ witnesses, confirmed at the Hearing that he had seen the Historical
Commission's Report shortly after it was issued.226 It should be recalled here that Mr.
Cock had been managing the administrative procedures with the INC on behalf of
Gremco and Gremcitel throughout the years. He had, for example, appeared before the
Ad Hoc Commission in 2004 to present arguments on behalf of Gremco and before the
Peruvian Congress in 2008 on behalf of Gremcitel.22”7_ Although Mr. Cock testified that
he did not recall discussing the document with Mr. Levy himself,228 in response to the
Tribunal’s question of whether he had discussed the Report “with someone else within
Gremcitel in 2005”, he answered: “I don’t recall. /t is likely, it is probable, but | don’t
recall”.229 To the Tribunal, it is clear that Gremcitel and Mr. Levy learned about the 2005

Report and its content around the time of its issuance in 2005.

It is equally clear that foreseeability increased as time passed. The Tribunal is satisfied
that, due to his connections at the INC,2° sometime in 2007 Mr. Cock learned that the
INC was about to formalize the land delimitation and, in the ordinary course of events,
must have informed the Levys accordingly. The transfer of the shares was then set in
motion in a great hurry, as is evidenced by the fact that Gremcitel registered the transfer
before it had been formally notified of it.221 The fact that the transfer was perfected only
one day before the INC enacted the decision leaves no doubt about the correlation
between the change in Gremcitel’s ownership and the 2007 Resolution of which the
Claimants would then complain.

In the Tribunal’s view, the only reason for the sudden transfer of the majority of the shares
in Gremcitel to Ms. Levy was her nationality. The Claimants were unable to furnish any

reasonable explanation why Ms. Levy became a shareholder and why that happened by
then. At the Hearing, Mr. Levy explained that this had been a family decision2®2 and that
the transfer was motivated by the intention to internationalize the project.2° The Tribunal
does not see how transferring shares to a family member with a foreign nationality would
internationalize the project. What was sought to be internationalized was the soon-to-
be-crystallized domestic dispute. In other words, the only purpose of the transfer was to
obtain access to ICSID/BIT arbitration, which was otherwise precluded. To substantiate
their argument that the dispute was not foreseeable, the Claimants also rely on the
internal INC memorandum of 10 October 2007,2%4 which is referenced in the preamble
of the 2007 Resolution. According to the Claimants, the internal memorandum is dated
10 October 2007, but was submitted only on 15 October 2007. The Claimants’ argument
on the second date is not entirely clear. In any event, the Tribunal notes that the 2007
Resolution is dated 10 October 2007, thus rendering the 15 October 2007 date in the
memorandum irrelevant. Beyond that, the record contains no indication that contradicts
the Tribunal’s conclusion. The Claimants also note that "only the civil servant who
drafted this memorandum could foresee the promulgation of RD 1342”.285 Whatever the
civil servant who drafted that memorandum did or did not know about the 2007
Resolution, the Tribunal is convinced that the Levys could foresee the 2007 Resolution
as a very high probability when Ms. Levy was inserted into Gremcitel’s ownership, which

is what matters for the Tribunal’s inquiry as to the foreseeability of the dispute.

192. The fact that the only motivation to add Ms. Levy into the Gremcitel ownership structure
was her French nationality is confirmed by the language contained in the corporate
resolution of Hart Industries dated 7 March 2005. While the Tribunal has clarified that it
cannot attach any probative value to the corporate resolutions allegedly showing a 2005
transfer, it notes that the resolution of 7 March 2005 provides that the transfer of the
powers and rights to Ms. Levy would last “until all legal proceedings concerning
resolutions dated February 7th 2005 and February 9th 2005 are finished”. Because

there were no legal proceedings in Grenada concerning these resolutions at the time

282 See Tr. (Mr. Levy), at 299:11-15 (with regard to the alleged 2005 transfer, referring to his father's
will), and 302:10-11 (with regard to the 2007 transfer, stating that “this was a familial decision”).

when these documents were allegedly created,”*” the Tribunal is convinced that the
reference to “legal proceedings” refers to these ICSID proceedings.

193. In addition to these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that a global evaluation of the
facts of this case patently confirms that the Claimants’ restructuring constitutes an abuse.
The Tribunal wishes in particular to revert to the 2005 transfer, which it has already
extensively addressed in the context of the ratione temporis objection.

194. The Tribunal finds it extremely serious that the Claimants have attempted to establish
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction by way of documents which have turned out to be
untrustworthy, if not utterly misleading. The Tribunal recalls that the Claimants asked
notary Joseph, who accepted, to backdate corporate resolutions by 5 years. This fact
was conclusively established at the Hearing, as it was plainly admitted by notary Joseph
herself.28° Mr. Levy then returned to see Ms. Joseph sometime after April 2012, when
this arbitration was already underway, requesting the “rectification” of the backdated
notarization to ensure that the date of the alleged 2005 transfer was well documented.
Thus, Mr. Levy attempted to correct false information with further false information, on
which the Claimants then relied to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Furthermore, the
Tribunal has noted that the Claimants’ own position in respect of the corporate
resolutions is that a notarization was not required for a share transfer to be valid under
Grenadian law.”° If this is so, it is obvious that the only reason the Claimants sought to
backdate the documents was to manufacture the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. A global
evaluation of the facts relating to the Claimants’ attempts to establish jurisdiction thus

evinces a pattern of manipulative conduct that casts a bad light on their actions."

195. In light of the foregoing facts, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the corporate

restructuring by which Ms. Levy became the main shareholder of Gremcitel on 9 October

237 See Expert Opinion of Sheila Harris, 30 June 2013 (Exh. RWS-021), {I] 17-18; Results of Search of

238 See supra paragraphs 152-155.

239 Ms. Joseph also admitted that she would not have backdated the documents had she known that the
documents would be used in an international proceeding. See Tr. (Joseph), at 758:3-11

240 See C-PHB 2, {| 55.

241 The Tribunal notes that in the case of Renée Rose Levy de Levi v. Republic of Peru (I\CSID Case
No. ARB/10/17), the Tribunal denied an abuse of process objection. See Award, 26 February 2014, ff
153-154. The award was handed down just two days before the second and final round of the Parties’
post-hearing submissions, and it was referred to by the Claimants in a footnote of their last brief. See
C-PHB 2, 4, fn. 1. The Tribunal notes that the factual circumstances of that case (as the Tribunal can
appreciate them from reading the Award, as the Parties have not elaborated upon them) are distinct
from those of the present proceedings. The reference to that case is thus unhelpful for the present
purposes.

2007 constitutes an abuse of process. Therefore, the Tribunal is precluded from
exercising jurisdiction over this dispute.

THIRD OBJECTION: THE CLAIMANTS HAVE NO INVESTMENT

The Respondent presented a third objection, according to which the Claimants do not
possess a protected investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT because (i)
they have not acquired the “right to develop” the Costazul Project and (ii) they have not

made a contribution, nor assumed a risk.

The Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the Claimants’ abuse of process precludes
the Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute. Considerations of judicial
economy suggest that the Tribunal may dispense with dealing with arguments which
have no impact on the award.”4? In this case, given the Tribunal’s holding on abuse of
process, the outcome of the case would not be affected by the Respondent's third
objection, whatever the answer to such objection might be. Under these circumstances,

it is thus unnecessary to address the Respondent's third objection.

COSTS

The Claimants’ total costs incurred in connection with these proceedings amount to USD
2,146,858.72, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 1,571,858.72 and payments
to ICSID of USD 575,000. The Respondent's costs in connection with this arbitration
were USD 5,874,978.96, comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 5,299,978.96 and
payments to ICSID of 575,000.

Each Party has requested that its costs be borne by the other Party. Under Article 61(2)
of the ICSID Convention, “the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree,
assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and
shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.”
This provision establishes the Tribunal’s discretion in allocating ICSID arbitration costs
and the Parties’ costs, including legal fees.

242 See M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador, \CSID Case No.
ARB/03/6, Decision on the Application for Annulment, 19 October 2009, {[ 67 (“The obligation in Article
48(3) of the Washington Convention to deal with every question applies to every argument which is
relevant and in particular to arguments which might affect the outcome of the case. On the other hand,
it would be unreasonable to require a tribunal to answer each and every argument which was made in
connection with the issues that the tribunal has to decide [...]. [T]he tribunal must address all the parties’
“questions” [...] but is not required to comment on all arguments when they are of no relevance to the
award’, emphasis added).

Two approaches may be discerned in ICSID costs awards. Some tribunals apportion
ICSID costs in equal shares and rule that each party should bear its own costs. Others
apply the principle pursuant to which “costs follow the event”, with the result that the party
that does not prevail bears all or part of the costs of the proceedings, including those of

the other party.

. The Tribunal is of the view that a finding of abuse of process justifies an award of costs

against the unsuccessful party. Thus, the Claimants shall pay for the entirety of the costs
of the proceedings, i.e., for the costs of the Arbitral Tribunal and for the costs of the
proceeding. The Claimants shall thus reimburse the advances that the Respondent has
made to ICSID. In this latter respect, it is noted that the ICSID Secretariat will provide
the Parties with a statement of the case account in due course.

With regard to the legal fees and expenses borne by the Parties in connection with the
arbitration, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants sought to minimize the costs of the
proceedings, which is not the case of their opponent, as the disparity of the costs figures
shows. In these circumstances, the Tribunal finds it fair that the Claimants pay to the
Respondent the amount of USD 1,571,858.72, i.e., the sum which they themselves
considered necessary to present their case, as a contribution to the Respondent's fees

and expenses.

DECISION
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:
a. The Tribunal is precluded from exercising jurisdiction over this dispute;

b. The Claimants shall reimburse to the Respondent the amounts which the

Respondent has deposited with ICSID for the costs of the arbitration;

c. The Claimants shall pay USD 1,571,858.72 to the Respondent, as a contribution
to the legal fees and other expenses which the Respondent incurred in connection

with the arbitration;

d. All other requests for relief are dismissed.
