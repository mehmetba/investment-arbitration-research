PETITION TO CONFIRM, RECOGNIZE AND ENFORCE ARBITRATION AWARD

Petitioners, Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited and ConocoPhillips
Petrozuata B.V. (together, “ConocoPhillips” or the “Petitioners”), by and through the undersigned
counsel, hereby petition this Court for an order and judgment confirming, recognizing and
enforcing an arbitration award against Petrdleos de Venezuela, S.A., Corpoguanipa, S.A. and
PDVSA Petrdleo, S.A. (together, the “Respondents”). The Petition is supported by an
accompanying memorandum of law and Declaration of Elliot Friedman dated April 26, 2018
(“Friedman Declaration”), with Exhibits. In support of this Petition, ConocoPhillips respectfully
states as follows:

Nature of Action

1. Petitioners bring this proceeding under Section 207 of the Federal Arbitration Act
(“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 207, and Article III of United Nations Convention for the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, (the “New York Convention”), to

confirm, recognize and enforce a final, binding arbitration award (the “Final Award”) issued in

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document 1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 2 of 16

New York, New York, on April 24, 2018,! by an arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) duly constituted
under the auspices of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) in Phillips Petroleum
Company Venezuela Limited and ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. v. Petréleos de Venezuela, S.A.,
Corpoguanipa, S.A. and PDVSA Petréleo, S.A., Case No. 20549/ASM/JPA (C-20550/ASM) (the
“Arbitration”). Friedman Decl. § 4 & Ex. A.

2. ConocoPhillips respectfully requests that this Court confirm, recognize, and
enforce the Final Award and incorporate its terms into a judgment in favor of ConocoPhillips.
Petitioners also seek to recover the fees and expenses incurred in confirming the Final Award,
along with further relief as this Court may find just and proper.

Parties

3. Petitioner Phillips Petroleum Company Venezuela Limited (“ConocoHamaca”) is
a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips Company. ConocoHamaca is incorporated under
the laws of Bermuda, having its registered office at 600 North Dairy Ashford, Houston, Texas
77079-1175. At the time of the expropriation by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
(“Venezuela”) of large parts of the oil industry in the country, leading to the disputes underlying
the Final Award, ConocoHamaca held a 40 percent interest in the Hamaca Project, as defined
herein.

4. Petitioner ConocoPhillips Petrozuata B.V. (“ConocoPetrozuata”) is a wholly-
owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips Company. ConocoPetrozuata is incorporated under the laws
of The Kingdom of the Netherlands, having its registered office at New Babylon Gardens, Anna

van Buerenplein 41, 2595 DA, The Hague, Netherlands. At the time of Venezuela’s expropriation

' The ICC transmitted a copy of the Final Award to the parties on April 25, 2018. Friedman
Decl. § 4.

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document 1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 3 of 16

that led to the disputes underlying the Final Award, ConocoPetrozuata, as successor-in-interest to
Conoco Orinoco Inc. (a company likewise incorporated under the laws of The Kingdom of the
Netherlands), held a 50.1 percent interest in the Petrozuata Project, as defined herein.

5. Respondent Petréleos de Venezuela, S.A. (“PDVSA”) is the national oil company
of Venezuela, wholly owned by Venezuela and incorporated in Caracas, Venezuela.

6. Respondent PDVSA Petréleo (“PPSA”), a corporation organized and existing
under the laws of Venezuela, is the successor in interest of Maraven S.A., which executed the
Petrozuata Association Agreement, as defined herein. PPSA is wholly owned by Respondent
PDVSA.

7. Respondent Corpoguanipa, S.A. (“Corpoguanipa”), a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of Venezuela, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Respondent PPSA.
Respondent Corpoguanipa executed the Hamaca Association Agreement, as defined herein.

Jurisdiction and Venue

8. The Arbitration was seated, and the Final Award was rendered, in New York City.
Petitioners bring this summary proceeding under Chapter 2 of the FAA, 9 U.S.C. §§ 201 ef seq.,
and Article III of the New York Convention, to confirm, recognize and enforce the Final Award.

9. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this proceeding under 9 U.S.C.
§ 203, which provides that the “district courts of the United States . . . have original jurisdiction

over” any “action or proceeding falling under the [New York] Convention.” This proceeding
“fall[s] under the Convention,” because the Final Award arises out of commercial contracts
between Petitioners and Respondents—the Association Agreements and Guarantees, as defined

herein—none of which is a citizen of the United States. See 9 U.S.C. § 202 (providing that an

“arbitral award arising out of a legal relationship . . . which is considered as commercial . . . falls

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document 1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 4 of 16

under the Convention” unless the relationship was “entirely between citizens of the United
States”).

10. Venue is proper in this District under 9 U.S.C. § 204, because the Association
Agreements and Guarantees (described further herein) specify New York City as the seat of
arbitration. See 9 U.S.C. § 204 (providing that an “action or proceeding over which the district
courts have jurisdiction pursuant to section 203 of this title may be brought . . . in such court for
the district [] which embraces the place designated in the agreement as the place of arbitration if
such place is within the United States”).

11. PDVSA is an instrumentality of a foreign state under the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq.

12. PDVSA is not immune from the jurisdiction of this Court for purposes of this
Petition because the FSIA denies immunity to foreign states (or their instrumentalities, as defined
in 28 U.S.C. § 1603(a)) in an action to confirm an arbitral award governed by the New York
Convention. Specifically, the FSIA provides that a foreign state (or its instrumentality) is not
immune to jurisdiction in a suit:

either to enforce an agreement made by the foreign state with or for

the benefit of a private party. ..or to confirm an award made pursuant

to [] an agreement to arbitrate, if...the agreement or award is or may

be governed by a treaty or other international agreement in force in

the United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of

arbitral awards.
28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6). As noted above, the Final Award is governed by the New York
Convention, which is in force in the United States. See 9 U.S.C. § 201. Further, Respondents
have waived any immunity they might seek to assert in the underlying Association Agreements

and Guarantees. See Friedman Decl. Ex. C at § 17.7; Ex. D at §4; Ex. E at §9; 28 U.S.C. §

1605(a)(1).

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document 1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 5 of 16

13. This Court has personal jurisdiction over PDVSA as an agency or instrumentality
of Venezuela under 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b), which confers “[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign
state” and any “agency or instrumentality” thereof “as to every claim for relief’ for which the
foreign state does not enjoy sovereign immunity under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1605-1607, and over which
the Court has subject matter jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b); 28 U.S.C. § 1603(a)-(b).

14. This Court has personal jurisdiction over all the Respondents pursuant to 9 U.S.C.
§ 9 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k), because the Respondents consented to arbitrate in
New York and did, in fact, arbitrate in New York. See In re Coudert Bros. LLP, 2017 WL
1944162, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 10, 2017) (“By consenting to arbitration in New York, Defendant
has agreed to be amenable to the personal jurisdiction of this Court.”) (citing Doctor’s Assocs. v.
Stuart, 85 F.3d 975, 983 (2d Cir. 1996) (“A party who agrees to arbitrate in a particular jurisdiction
consents not only to personal jurisdiction but also to venue of the courts within that jurisdiction.”)).
Further, if PPSA and/or Corpoguanipa were deemed an organ, agency or instrumentality of a
foreign state within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 1603, this Court would also have personal
jurisdiction over them pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b).

Background
a) The Agreements and Respondents’ Failure to Perform

15. The Final Award results from disputes between Petitioners and Respondents that

arose under Association Agreements and Guarantees between the parties, specifically:
i. the Petrozuata Association Agreement (dated November 10,
1995 and as modified June 18, 1997, between Conoco Orinoco
Inc. (of which ConocoPetrozuata is the successor in interest) and

Maraven S.A. (of which PPSA is the successor in interest))
(Friedman Decl. 47 & Ex. B);

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document 1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 6 of 16

ii. the Hamaca Association Agreement (dated July 9, 1997, between
(among others) Corpoguanipa and ConocoHamaca) (id. 47 & Ex.
C) (together with the Petrozuata Association Agreement, the
“Association Agreements”);

iii. the Petrozuata Guaranty (dated November 10, 1995, between
Conoco Orinoco Inc. (of which ConocoPetrozuata is the
successor in interest) and PDVSA) (id. § 7 & Ex. D); and

iv. the Hamaca Guarantee (dated July 9, 1997, between (among
others) PDVSA and ConocoHamaca) (id. 7 & Ex. E) (together
with the Petrozuata Guaranty, the “Guarantees”).

16. The Association Agreements and Guarantees set forth the commercial terms of an
arrangement under which ConocoPhillips would invest and participate in two extra-heavy crude
oil projects in the Orinoco oil belt in Venezuela, the “Petrozuata Project” and the “Hamaca Project”
(together the “Projects”).

17. In the early 1990s, the Venezuelan government decided, as a matter of strategic and
economic priority, to develop the vast hydrocarbon resources in the Orinoco oil belt, which it
estimated to contain over one trillion barrels of oil. The exploitation of the Orinoco’s extra-heavy
oil reserves had stymied Venezuela since the 1920s. The Venezuelan government recognized that
it did not have the means or ability to carry out that task alone.

18. Venezuela therefore embarked on the Apertura Petrolera, or “Oil Opening.” To
induce foreign investors to return to an oil industry that had been nationalized less than 20 years
before, Venezuela offered an attractive set of incentives, including majority equity stakes in long-
term oil projects, subject to a bespoke fiscal regime that included substantially reduced income
taxes and royalties.

19. The contracts that accompanied this Oil Opening—including the Association

Agreements and Guarantees at issue in the Arbitration—also provided foreign investors with

additional layers of protection. In particular, the PDVSA subsidiaries that executed the

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document 1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 7 of 16

Association Agreements agreed to partially indemnify Petitioners for specified Venezuelan
government actions that would be adverse to Petitioners’ interests (referred to in the Association
Agreements as “Discriminatory Actions”). Further, PDVSA guaranteed the contractual
performance of its subsidiaries via the Guarantees that accompanied the Hamaca and Petrozuata
Association Agreements.

20. On the basis of these fiscal inducements and contractual protections,
ConocoPhillips invested billions of U.S. dollars (over a decade) into the Projects to extract and
upgrade extra-heavy crude oil. Commercial production of oil commenced in 2001 at the
Petrozuata Project and in 2004 at the Hamaca Project.

21. However, beginning in 2004, the Venezuelan government initiated a series of
measures that eventually resulted in the confiscation of the Projects and their delivery into
Respondents’ hands in 2007, without any compensation paid to Petitioners.

22. Notwithstanding the adverse measures and the expropriation, Respondents
Corpoguanipa and PPSA did not pay the indemnification due to Petitioners under the Association
Agreements (for “Discriminatory Actions”), while PDVSA failed to ensure its subsidiaries’
performance and that these payments were made. At the time of the final dispossession in 2007,
the Projects had together achieved in excess of US $14 billion in revenue, and had yielded
dividends to Petitioners in excess of US $1 billion in 2006 alone.

23. Petitioners and related entities then commenced two sets of actions against
Respondents and Venezuela. First, ConocoPhillips entities commenced an arbitration against
Venezuela for inter alia the unlawful expropriation of their investments in the Projects. That
arbitration proceeding, which is being heard under the auspices of the International Centre for

Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”), an arm of the World Bank, is premised on an

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document 1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 8 of 16

international law instrument—a bilateral investment treaty—and the claims asserted are governed
by international law. That arbitration proceeding remains pending: in 2013, the ICSID tribunal
found Venezuela to have effected the expropriation in violation of international law, and the ICSID
tribunal is in the process of determining the damages payable for that breach. A final award is
expected in the fall of this year. See Friedman Decl. § 14-15 & Ex. I.

24. Second, on October 10, 2014, Petitioners brought two contractual ICC arbitration
claims against Respondents under national law instruments—the Association Agreements and
Guarantees—that were subsequently consolidated and which Arbitration is the subject of this
Petition. Id. JJ 8-9 & Exs. F& G.

b) The Agreements to Arbitrate

25. The Association Agreements and Guarantees provided for arbitration in the event
of a dispute between the parties. The arbitration clauses in all of those contracts are consistent,
providing for arbitration under the rules of the ICC and with the seat of arbitration in New York
City:

i. Section 13.16 of the Petrozuata Association Agreement provides as follows:
All disputes arising in connection with the present Agreement shall

be finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Conciliation and
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce in

accordance with the said Rules. . . . The place of arbitration shall
be New York, New York, United States of America. . .. Any decision
or award of the arbitral tribunal . . . shall be final and binding on

the parties to the arbitration proceeding.
ii. Section 17.2 of the Hamaca Association Agreement provides as follows:

Any dispute arising out of, or relating in any way to this Agreement
shall be settled exclusively and finally by arbitration ...in
accordance with ICC Rules... . [A]ll proceedings . . . shall be
conducted in New York City. ... The award . . . shall be final and
binding upon the Parties.

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document 1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 9 of 16

iii. | Section 4 of the Petrozuata Guaranty provides as follows:

All disputes arising in connection with this Guaranty, or the breach,
termination, interpretation, enforceability or validity thereof, shall
be finally settled by binding arbitration in New York, New York,
USA, under the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce.

iv. Section 13 of the Hamaca Guarantee provides as follows:

Any disputes resulting from or related to this Guarantee or its
performance will be resolved exclusively by arbitration and any
arbitration ruling will be binding. The arbitration will be governed
and conducted in accordance with the [rules of] the International
Chamber of Commerce. . .. All arbitration procedures described in
this Guarantee will be conducted in the city of New York, United
States of America.

Friedman Decl. Ex. B at § 13.16; Ex. C at § 17.2; Ex. D at §4; Ex. E at § 13.

oC Phillips Ce d Arbitration Pr li

 

26. ConocoPhillips commenced the Arbitration that is the subject of this Petition on
October 10, 2014 by filing two Requests for Arbitration (one under each Association Agreement
and related Guarantee). In their Requests for Arbitration, Petitioners asserted claims that included,
inter alia, claims for indemnification for “Discriminatory Actions” under the relevant provisions
of the Association Agreements and Guarantees. Each Petitioner requested an award of
compensation plus interest, other relief as the Tribunal considered appropriate, and the legal fees
and costs incurred in the arbitral proceedings. Friedman Decl. § 8 & Exs. F & G.

27. On January 13, 2015, Respondents consented to the consolidation of these ICC
proceedings under Case No. 20549/ASM (C-20550/ASM) pursuant to Article 10 of the 2012 Rules
of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Rules”), which governed the ICC

Arbitration. Id. J 9.

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 10 of 16

28. The Tribunal was constituted on March 27, 2015 in accordance with the ICC Rules.
It consisted of two arbitrators, Professor Laurent Aynés (appointed by Petitioners) and Professor
Andrea Giardina (appointed by Respondents), who together nominated Dr. Laurent Lévy as
President of the Tribunal. Jd. § 10 & Ex. H.

29. As stipulated in the Association Agreements, the legal seat of the arbitration was
New York, New York. The Arbitration hearings physically took place in New York, New York
and in Washington, D.C.

30. Pursuant to the timetable established by the Tribunal, the parties exchanged briefing
(accompanied by witness statements, expert reports and exhibits) and engaged in documentary
discovery. The initial Case Management Conference was held on June 12, 2015, in New York
City. The parties made written submissions to the Tribunal in support of their claims on July 17,
2015, May 27, 2016, and March 20, 2017 (by Petitioners); and on February 12, 2016, September
9, 2016 and March 20, 2017 (by Respondents). The Tribunal convened a final hearing between
November 28, 2016 and December 10, 2016. Friedman Decl. {§ 11-12.

31. The parties were represented by counsel throughout the course of the Arbitration.
Respondents were represented by attorneys of the law firm Curtis, Mallet-Provost, Colt & Mosle
LLP.

d) The Final Award

32. The Tribunal rendered its unanimous Final Award on April 24, 2018, in New York,

New York. The Final Award is binding upon the parties. A copy of the Final Award was delivered

to the parties on April 25, 2018 in accordance with the ICC Rules. Friedman Decl. § 4 & Ex. A.

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 11 of 16

33. The Tribunal found that Respondents were required to indemnify Claimants under
the Discriminatory Actions provisions contained in the Association Agreements. Friedman Decl.
Ex. A at 9,294.

34, Specifically, the Tribunal found that Venezuela’s imposition of an income tax
increase on the Projects, and the government’s ultimate expropriation of Petitioners’ interests in
the Projects, were Discriminatory Actions for which indemnification was owing. Jd.

35. The Tribunal accordingly ordered Respondents:

i. PPSA and PDVSA, jointly and severally, to pay Petitioner
ConocoPetrozuata, under the Petrozuata Association Agreement and
Petrozuata Guaranty, the sum of US $489,334,468.87, plus simple interest
at the rate of 12-month LIBOR, running from May 28, 2016;

ii. | Corpoguanipa and PDVSA, jointly and severally, to pay ConocoHamaca,
under the Hamaca Association Agreement and Hamaca Guarantee, the sum
of US $1,496,712,745.85, plus simple interest at the rate of 3-month
LIBOR, running from May 28, 2016; and

iii. to reimburse to Petitioners the sum of US $231,200 in costs, with simple
interest to accrue on that amount at 12-month LIBOR starting from the date
of the Final Award.

Id. § 544 (joint and several liability) & { 1163 (dollar amounts).

36. With interest to date under the terms of the Final Award, the Final Award against
PPSA and PDVSA, jointly and severally, presently stands in the amount of US $506,174,755.
With interest to date, the Final Award against Corpoguanipa and PDVSA, jointly and severally,

presently stands at the amount of US $1,532,157,127. Together with the award to Petitioners for

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 12 of 16

reimbursement of costs, the aggregate value of the Final Award, at present, is US $2,038,563,082.
Friedman Decl. { 5.
37. The Award has not been has been set aside or suspended by a competent authority
of the country in which, or under the law of which, the Award was made.
e) Respondents Have Not Paid the Final Award
38. Respondents have not paid Petitioners any portion of the Final Award and have
expressed no intention to do so, and have not responded to a demand letter issued immediately
after the ICC transmitted the Final Award to the parties. Jd. § 16.
39. Pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207, Petitioners have brought this action within three years
after the Award was issued on April 24, 2018.
COUNT I
(Confirmation of Award Under 9 USC § 207)
40. ConocoPhillips incorporates each and every allegation in the preceding paragraphs
as if set forth fully herein.
Al. The United States is a contracting party to the New York Convention, as is
Venezuela.”
42. The Final Award is governed by the New York Convention (made applicable in
this proceeding by Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 201 et seq.), because the
Final Award arises out of commercial contracts between Petitioners and Respondents, none of

whom is a citizen of the United States. See 9 U.S.C. § 202.

2 See New York Arbitration Convention, Contracting States,
http://www.newyorkconvention.org/countries (last accessed April 26, 2018).

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 13 of 16

43. Article IV of the New York Convention provides that a party applying for
recognition and enforcement of an award, such as Petitioners here, “shall, at the time of the
application, supply: (a) [t]he duly authenticated original award or a duly certified copy thereof;
[and] (b) [t]he original agreement [to arbitrate] referred to in article II or a duly certified copy
thereof.” A copy of the Final Award, duly authenticated and transmitted to Petitioners, is
submitted herewith as Exhibit A to the Friedman Declaration.

44. The parties’ agreements to arbitrate are found in section 17 of the Hamaca
Association Agreement, section 13 of the Hamaca Guarantee, section 13.16 of the Petrozuata
Association Agreement, and section 4 of the Petrozuata Guaranty. Those agreements are appended
as Exhibits B, C, D & E to the Friedman Declaration.

45. The Award arose out of a legal relationship that is commercial within the meaning
of 9 U.S.C. § 202.

46. Pursuant to Article 31(3) of the applicable 2012 ICC Rules, the Award was made
at the place of arbitration, New York, New York, United States of America.

47. Pursuant to Article 34(6) of the applicable 2012 ICC Rules, the Final Award is
“binding on the parties.” In addition, the Hamaca Association Agreement and Hamaca Guarantee
expressly provide that arbitration rulings will be “binding.” See Friedman Decl. Ex. C § 17.2(e)
& Ex. E § 13. The Petrozuata Association Agreement and Petrozuata Guaranty likewise provide
for “binding” arbitration. See Friedman Decl. Ex. B § 13.16 & Ex. D § 4.

48. The Final Award is therefore final and binding within the meaning of the New York
Convention and Chapter 2 of the FAA.

49. 9 U.S.C. § 207 provides that, in an action to confirm an award governed by the New

York Convention, the “court sha// confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal

Case 1:18-cv-03716-VEC Document1 Filed 04/26/18 Page 14 of 16

or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said Convention.” 9 U.S.C.
§ 207 (emphasis added).

50. For awards governed by the New York Convention rendered in the United States,
the domestic provisions of the FAA apply, which provide that a court may vacate an arbitration
award in certain narrow circumstances expressly enumerated in the FAA. See 9 U.S.C. § 10.

51. Further, the party resisting confirmation or seeking vacatur of an award has the
“heavy” burden of proving that one of the explicit grounds enumerated in the FAA or the New
York Convention applies. See Zeiler v. Deitsch, 500 F.3d 157, 164 (2d Cir. 2007) (party opposing
confirmation has the burden to prove that one of the defenses applies and noting that the “burden
is a heavy one, as the showing required to avoid summary confirmance is high”) (internal citations
omitted). As explained further in the accompanying Memorandum of Law, none of the New York
Convention’s or the FAA’s enumerated grounds for refusing or deferring recognition applies to
the Final Award.

52. For the foregoing reasons, Petitioners are entitled to an order confirming,
recognizing, and enforcing the Award pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207 and Article III of the New York
Convention. Petitioners respectfully request the Court to confirm the Final Award by entering
judgment in favor of Petitioners and against Respondents in the amount of the Final Award with
interest as provided therein, plus the costs of this proceeding.
