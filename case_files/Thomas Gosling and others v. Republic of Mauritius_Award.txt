On September 27, 2016, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request, as
supplemented, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the
Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General
invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in
accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation

and Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The dispute concerns two areas in Mauritius, Le Morne Brabant (“Le Morne”) and Pointe
Jéréme. The facts related to each area are described separately below. A brief summary of
the factual background related to each area, as set out in the Parties’ submissions and
factual exhibits, is also provided below. This summary does not constitute any finding by

the Tribunal on any facts disputed by the Parties.

LE MORNE

Le Morne is a peninsula of outstanding beauty, and cultural and historical significance. It
had been a place of refuge for escaped slaves, known as “maroons.” Because of its natural
beauty and significance, Mauritius was interested in inscription of Le Morne in UNESCO’s
World Heritage List. For this purpose, Mauritius engaged in March 2003 two consultants,
Mr. Hadi Saliba and Dr. Elizabeth Wangari, to prepare a Tentative List of possible
UNESCO World Heritage Sites, a first step for their eventual inscription in the World
Heritage List. The Tentative List was submitted to UNESCO in July 2003. It included Le

Morne.!

Beginning in 2003, Mr. Gosling explored possible investments in Mauritius. The
opportunity to develop the Le Morne site arose as a result of Mr. Gosling’s relationship
with the local landowners, the Cambier family, which held land through Société du Morne

Brabant (“SMB”).

In 2003, Mr. Gosling established with other UK investors Mauritian Property Partnerships
(“MPP”).3

In early 2004, Mr. Saliba recommended boundaries for the Le Morne site. He divided it
into a core and a buffer zone. He advised the Government to demolish houses on the higher
northern slopes and recommended that regulations preventing alterations or extensions to
existing tourist facilities or private houses be enforced. On January 30, 2004, the Cabinet

took note of the recommendations and published Mr. Saliba’s report (the “Saliba Report”).*

On April 21, 2004, PPDM (UK) and Mr. Bertrand Giraud of SMB entered into a
Co-operation Agreement (the “2004 Co-operation Agreement”) with a view to carrying out
a tourist development at Le Morne (the “Le Morne Project”).> The Co-operation
Agreement envisaged other contracts including a development agreement and land

purchase agreement.°

On May 7, 2004, the Claimants presented the Le Morne Project to Mauritius.”

On May 4, 2004, Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund Act was enacted. It adopted the core and
buffer zone boundaries proposed in the Saliba Report and established the Le Morne

Heritage Trust Fund (“LMHTP’). It came into force on July 1, 2004.8

On June 23, 2004, SMB applied to the Board of Investment (“BOT”) for an Investment
Certificate (“IRS Investment Certificate”) pursuant to the Investment Promotion Integrated

Resort Scheme Regulations (“IRS Regulations”).?

On September 21, 2004, BOI sought the views of the Ministry of Arts and Culture
(“MAC’”).'° One day later, MAC advised BOI to be guided by the recommendations of the
Saliba Report, “especially regarding the delimitation of the core and buffer zones of the Le

Morne Heritage site [...].”!!

In order to implement the Le Morne Project, LMB was incorporated on January 13, 2005.'?

On March 15, 2005, LMHTF recommended that MAC request assistance of an expert from
UNESCO’s World Heritage Center to advise, among other matters, on the Le Morne
Project submitted by SMB pursuant to the IRS Regulations submitted by SMB. Dr. George

Abungu was the expert selected to provide assistance to Mauritius. !*
On August 1, 2005, Dr. Abungu submitted his first report (the “First Abungu Report”). '*

On August 26, 2005, SMB pressed BOI to issue a Letter of Intent (“LOT”) in view of the

conclusions reached by Dr. Abungu.!>

meeting with MAC to go over them, and pressing BOI to issue a LOI before the end of the

year.!°

an IRS Investment Certificate for the Le Morne Project.”°

On December 30, 2005, the Cabinet approved the recommendations of Dr. Abungu and
allowed BOI to issue the LOI. The LOI was issued by BOI on the same day (the “2005

On January 24, 2006, Le Morne was designated a National Heritage site by the Ministry of
Housing and Lands (“MHL”).

In January 2006, Mauritius submitted Dr. Abungu’s dossier to UNESCO. It was rejected
on March 1, re-submitted on April 7, and rejected again on May 2, 2006.74

In the meantime, the Claimants requested on March 22, and obtained on April 21, 2006, an

extension of three months of the LOI for a tourism investment certificate.”

On April 26, 2006, MAC requested UNESCO to recommend an expert to help prepare a

draft management plan.7°

On May 30, 2006, Mr. Giraud explained to BOI that his major issue was that he needed “to
purchase the land from my family before the 30th of [J]une, failing which, my option with
my family will become null and void. The money from MPP will be on the notary account
before the end of [J]une but if the BOI does not issue the investment certificate, no
transaction will be possible.”?’ Mr. Giraud requested that BOI confirm that the IRS
Investment Certificate could be issued without difficulty subject to submission of an

Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) and development permits.”*

On June 2, 2006, BOI reminded SMB of the requirements set forth in the LOI for the IRS

Investment Certificate.”

On June 30, 2006, the LOI for an IRS Investment Certificate expired. On the same date,

with SMB, which set out the share ownership of LMB, and the entitlement to profits of the
UK investors (the “2006 Shareholders’ Agreement”). PPH was given control of LMB and
entitled to a priority dividend equal to 25% of the total development costs that it incurred,

and then half of the profits of LMB.*°

PPH’s share ownership needed to be authorized by the Prime Minister’s office under the
Non-Citizen (Property Restriction) Act. For this reason, on June 30, 2006, an intermediary
agreement was also entered into between PPH and SMB as an addendum to the 2006
Shareholders’ Agreement (the “2006 Intermediary Agreement”). It was agreed that
Mr. Giraud would hold all of the shares in LMB and that, upon receiving approval from
the Prime Minister’s office, Mr. Giraud would issue shares in LMB to PPH in order to give
effect to the terms of the 2006 Shareholders’ Agreement. However, if such authorization
was not forthcoming or necessary, “PPH will be appointed to promote and conclude the
project in all its aspects as provided in the Agreement and in prior Development
Agreements entered into by the parties. This contract will provide, inter alia, for funding

of the Project and sharing of profits as already set out in the Agreement.”*!

permitted development in the buffer zone: “Quality/luxury hillside retreats and eco-tourism

lodges should be the preferred development type.”?°

In July-August 2007, Dr. Odendaal and Prof. Bakker advised that the Government revise
PPG2. MHL withdrew PPG2 from its website.*°

In September 2007, Mauritius revised PPG2 (“Revised PPG2”). That revised version was
approved on October 8, 2007. Under Revised PPG2, no development was permitted in the

POINTE JEROME

Pointe Jér6me is an area comprising a salt-water lagoon bounded by islands and smaller
lagoons. The leased area covers over 13 hectares and had been leased to Pointe Jéréme
Development Limited (“PJD”), a company controlled by Mr. Yves Tostée, under the terms
of an industrial lease dated May 7, 2004 (the “Lease”) for a tourism development project.
The Lease required that construction of the development start within 15 months from
signing and be finished within three years. The period to start construction had been

extended a “final” time for six months. Thus, it was due to expire on February 7, 2006.4?

On October 25, 2005, PPDM (UK), at the time known as Possessio No. 2 Limited, entered
into a share purchase agreement with Mr. Tostée (the “2005 SPA”) for the acquisition of
90% of Mr. Tostée’s shares in the Silver Management Co, Ltd. (“SML”), which in turn
owned all the shares in PJD.*? In 2007, Mr. Tostée, PPH and PJD entered into a
shareholders’ agreement (the “Pointe Jéréme SHA”).** Under the Pointe Jéré6me SHA,
PPH was designated by PPDM (UK) as the entity to acquire the shares of Mr. Tostée. The
Pointe Jéréme SHA was undated and the date of signature is disputed by the Parties as
discussed later in this Award.*> The PPH shareholding in SML was registered on April 30,
2008.4°

The Claimants allege that on January 23, 2006, they notified the BOI that they would
require a further extension.” The significance of the letter of PJD to MHL is controversial

between the Parties.

B. | THE RESPONDENT’S REQUEST FOR RELIEF

86. The Respondent seeks the following relief:

For the foregoing reasons, Mauritius respectfully requests that the
Tribunal render an award in its favor. Mauritius requests in
particular that the Tribunal:

a. Find that jurisdiction is lacking over all claims raised by
Claimants and dismiss all claims in their entirety and with
prejudice;

b. In the alternative, and with respect to any claim not
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, find that Mauritius has not
breached any right of Claimants conferred or created by the Treaty
and dismiss all claims in their entirety and with prejudice;

c In the event and to the extent that Mauritius is found to have
breached any such right, Mauritius requests that the Tribunal find
that Claimants have suffered no compensable loss, deny the

511. Reply, para. 250.

compensation requested by Claimants, and dismiss the claims in
their entirety and with prejudice;

d. In all events, order Claimants to pay all costs and expenses
of this proceeding, including but not limited to, the fees and
expenses of the Tribunal, the administrative fees and expenses of
ICSID, all costs of Mauritius’ legal representation and expert
assistance, all other associated costs of arbitration (translators,
interpreters, travel, etc.), plus pre-award and post-award interest
thereon calculated from the date on which these amounts were
incurred at the average 6-month U.S. LIBOR rate until the date of
payment, compounded semiannually or at any rate the Tribunal
deems appropriate; and

e. Grant any other or additional relief as may be appropriate
under the circumstances or as may otherwise be just and proper.

Mauritius reserves its right to supplement or otherwise amend the
above requests.*?

APPLICABLE LAW

Applicable law is not a subject on which the Parties differ or that has been a matter of
discussion between the Parties. Article 8 of the BIT does not set forth the rules to be applied
by the Tribunal in deciding the dispute. Absent the Parties’ agreement, Article 42(1) of the
ICSID Convention requires the Tribunal to “apply the law of the Contracting State party
to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international

law as may be applicable.”

Given the nature of the claims that the Respondent breached its obligations under the BIT,
the Tribunal shall apply the provisions of the BIT and interpret them in accordance to the
tules of interpretation set forth in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the
Treaties. This notwithstanding, there are matters underlying the claims such as the
conditions to acquire rights to land in Mauritius or to its development to which Mauritian

law applies.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

qd)

The Claimants’ Memorial

In their Memorial, the Claimants explain that their dispute meets the jurisdictional

requirements of the BIT and the ICSID Convention:*?

a.

The dispute arises under the BIT. In Article 8(1) of the BIT, the Respondent agreed to
arbitration under the ICSID Convention. The Claimant agreed to submit disputes to

arbitration by submitting their Request for Arbitration to ICSID.

Mr. Gosling is a national of the UK and PPDM (UK) is a company incorporated or
constituted under the law in force in the UK. TGI, PPD and PPH are companies
incorporated or constituted under Mauritian law and the majority of their shares were
at all times owned before the dispute arose by UK nationals or UK companies.
Mr. Gosling owned the majority of the shares of TGI. PPD was owned from June 16,
2006 until early 2008 by Mr. Gosling (50%) and another UK national, Mr. Christopher
Wilkins (50%). Afterwards, PPD was indirectly owned by Mr. Gosling through TGI.
PPH was at all times owned by PPD and, indirectly, by nationals of the UK. In 2009,
the Claimants restructured their investment in Le Morne as a result of which TGI took
over PPH’s interest in LMB. The Claimants affirm that TGI, PPD and PPH continue to

be controlled by nationals or companies of the UK to this date.

The Claimants describe generally their investment to be constituted by funds expended
on development projects, the Claimants’ contractual rights in relation to the projects
giving rise to a right to returns from and control over the projects, and the Claimants’
shares in companies involved in the projects. The Tribunal will describe later the
investments in more detail as necessary for the understanding of the claims and the

analysis of the Tribunal.

53 See Cl. Mem., Sec. III.

20

90.

91.

92.

d. The dispute arises directly out of the investments, and the actions affecting the
investments of the PMO, the BOI, the MHL, the MAC, the LMHTF, the LMHTFB,
and the Ministry of Environment, which are all entities or individuals whose actions

may be attributed to the State.

(2) The Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on
Jurisdiction

The Respondent sets out the full factual and legal context of its objections to the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal in its Request for Bifurcation.** The Respondent expands on this in its
Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction. The Respondent argues
that the BIT only protects rights and assets acquired in accordance with domestic law even
when this requirement is not expressly stated as part of the BIT’s definition of investment,
which is the case here. The contention of the Respondent is that protection by the BIT is
contingent upon the Claimants demonstrating that the alleged investments were admitted

by the Respondent and the alleged rights lawfully acquired under Mauritian law.*°

The Respondent’s position is premised on the requirements imposed by the Non-Citizen
(Property Restriction) Act on ownership of property, widely defined, by non-citizens in
Mauritius. The Respondent points out that the alleged rights under the 2004 Co-operation
Agreement and the 2006 Shareholders’ Agreement were tied to the ownership of shares in
LMB. The Claimants admit that the purchase of these shares never received the required
PMO approval.*° The Respondent argues that “[i}f the Le Morne Claimants never lawfully
acquired the shares in LMB, they likewise never acquired the contractual rights attaching

to them.”°7

The Respondent also points out that Claimants PPH and TGI concluded the 2006 and 2009

Intermediary Agreements pending PMO approval. The Respondent contests that, as

affirmed by the Claimants, these agreements conferred on Mr. Giraud “contractual rights
to promote a development project and share in its profits,” and that he would “remain the
sole beneficial holder of the rights and interests in the Le Morne land should PMO consent
not be granted.”°* The Respondent argues that, in fact, under the Intermediary Agreements,
Mr. Giraud could not take any action or sign or agree to any document or proposition
without the prior approval of PPH and TGI and hence, notwithstanding the appearances,

LMB would be managed and controlled by non-citizens.*°

The Respondent also disputes the Claimants’ assertion that they applied for PMO approval.
Only PPH applied for PMO’s approval of its share ownership in LMB, a year and a half
after concluding the Shareholders’ Agreement. The Respondent contends that “[a]n
investor cannot rely on an investment treaty to claim protection for a private contract the

object of which is not permitted by law.”°°

The Respondent affirms that it never approved the Claimants’ investments nor waived its
right to raise the present objections. The Respondent disputes the significance attributed
by the Claimants to the identification of the project as a “Top Priority Project” and fast
tracking for approval by the Cabinet Fast Track Committee and the BOI. The Respondent
explains that at the time it had no knowledge of the Intermediary Agreements, and there is
no evidence that the Claimants ever submitted them to BOI or with the application for the
approval of issuing shares of LMB to PPH. Similarly, the LOIs do not amount to a waiver
or approval. Furthermore, the BOI is not authorized to approve investments, a letter of
intent is no more than “an informal step in the process of seeking certain incentives”, and
the LOIs were issued to Mr. Giraud as Managing Director of LMB and SMB and not to the

Claimants.*!

According to the Respondent, the Claimants mischaracterize the negotiations with the
Government on possible compensation. The Respondent claims that, until the Claimants
initiated their Supreme Court case, Government officials negotiating with the Claimants
on a possible land swap were not aware that the Claimants had not obtained PMO approval
to acquire immovable property at Le Morne. The Respondent contends that Mr. Gosling

was negotiating as the owner of LMB and owner of land as if he had obtained approval.°?

The Respondent argues that even if the rights and interests of PPH in the Le Morne Project
would qualify for protection, PPH divested itself of them in favor of TGI under the 2006
Shareholders’ Agreement and 2006 Intermediary Agreement or by way of the “Consent
Judgment” where PPH and Mr. Gosling agreed to SMB’s subrogation of all the rights,
interests and stake of PPH into LMB.®

As regards Pointe Jér6me, the Respondent contends that the claims arising from PPDM
(UK) and PPH’s alleged contractual rights in the Pointe Jéréme SPA and the Pointe Jér6me
SHA refer to rights that did not come into existence before the alleged breach which
occurred on September 20, 2007, when the lease was cancelled. In support, the Respondent
points out, inter alia, that (i) the actual share transfer from SML to PPDM (UK) (MPP)
was not registered until April 28, 2008; (ii) on April 17, 2008, the Claimants declared that
Mr. Tostée still owned 100% of the shares in SML; and (iii) in contradiction to what is
claimed here, the Claimants have argued before the Mauritian courts that the Pointe Jéréme

SPA was null and void.“

The Respondent submits that Mr. Gosling and PPD cannot assert claims in respect of
indirectly held contractual rights. The Respondent explains that neither Mr. Gosling nor
PPD are party to the contracts related to the proposed developments at Le Morne and Pointe

Jér6me. They advance their claims as direct or indirect shareholders in the companies

which are party to those contracts. The Respondent observes that the BIT definition of
investment does not include investments indirectly controlled by nationals or companies

of the other party.

The Respondent similarly dismisses the Claimants’ argument that pre-investment
expenditures constitute assets under the BIT. Furthermore, in the case of pre-investment
expenditures for the Le Morne Project, the LOI from BOI explicitly disclaimed any liability
if “the project is not implemented as a consequence of the non-obtention of any permits
and clearances required in furtherance of the realization of the project or for any other

reason not within the control of the Board of Investment.”

The Respondent asserts that the Claimants’ case is not premised on the basis that either
their shareholdings, or rights owing under Mauritian law to the Claimants’ status as
shareholders, have been wrongfully treated by Mauritius.® According to the Respondent,
the “Claimants focused their case exclusively on inquiring into the value of the Le Morne
and Pointe Jér6me sites, and of the claimed contractual instruments and obligations

purportedly undertaken by Mauritius [...].”°*

The Respondent further argues that TGI is not a UK company under Article 8(1) of the
BIT; it had not even been created before the dispute arose. Therefore, it is not entitled to

the BIT protection.©

The Respondent pleads that the Tribunal should decline to hear the Le Morne claims under
the doctrines of lis pendens and abuse of rights. According to the Respondent, “[wJhen
considering whether the proceedings overlap sufficiently to require the application of lis

pendens, the contemporary approach is to employ a measure of flexibility [...].”’° The

Respondent asserts that the parties in this proceeding and the Mauritian domestic
proceedings are substantially the same, and the key allegations in the two sets of

proceedings concern the allegation that the approval of PPG2 was arbitrary and unfair.”!

As regards abuse of process, the Respondent contends that the same factors that support
dismissal on grounds of lis pendens also support a claim of abuse of right by the Le Morne

Claimants.”

(3) The Claimants’ Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction

The Claimants assert that their contractual rights are protected investments because the
definition of investment does not contain any requirement that an investment be made in
accordance with the law of the host State. Furthermore, the decisions of arbitral tribunals
adduced by the Respondent are not pertinent because the relevant wording in the treaties
was different or applied different principles. The Claimants add that the Non-Citizen

(Property Restriction) Act does not restrict conditional agreements. ”*

The Claimants affirm that the procedure followed in Le Morne was the same as in the case
of a project at Les Salines. The Claimants contend that the Intermediary Agreements
“expressly recognized that the acquisition of shares in LMB would require PMO consent,
and that, if consent could not be obtained in a timely manner, PPH and TGI were to be
conferred contractual rights to promote a development project and share in its profits.
Mr. Giraud (a Mauritian citizen) was to remain the sole beneficial holder of the rights and
interests in the Le Morne land should PMO consent not be granted.””* The Claimants assert
that successive Prime Ministers de facto approved the Le Morne Project and argue that the

LOI should preclude the Respondent from relying on belated technical objections.”>

According to the Claimants, the Respondent did not exercise the “powers conferred by its

laws” under Article 2(1) of the BIT. In support, the Claimants rely on the alleged

encouragement to invest they received from high level members of Government and on the
fact that the project was identified as a “Top Priority Project” and fast tracked for approval
by the Cabinet Fast Track Committee and BOI. The Claimants assert that, as part of the
approval process, they submitted copies of all relevant documents to BOI, including the
2004 Co-operation Agreement, and, following the grant of the LOI, they entered into the
2006 Shareholders’ Agreement and the 2006 Intermediary Agreement.’ The Claimants
conclude that, “[i]n light of this course of conduct engaged in by Mauritius, including its
decision not to reject the Claimants’ investment at Le Morne, Mauritius cannot now raise

an objection based on the alleged non-compliance of the investment with Mauritian law.”””

The Claimants contend that, even if they had breached the Non-Citizen (Property
Restriction) Act, the Tribunal would still have jurisdiction. The Claimants argue that trivial
breaches of the host State’s legal order do not fall within the requirement that an investment
be made in accordance with such order. The Claimants place emphasis on the application
of the principle of proportionality between the alleged breach and the denial of the BIT

protection.”

The Claimants dispute that PPH transferred its rights to claim under the BIT when
transferring rights in LMB to TGI in 2009. They contend that it is for Mauritius to prove
that such rights were transferred since it is Mauritius that made the allegation that the rights
had been transferred. Furthermore, even if PPH had transferred its right to claim under the
BIT to TGI, TGI is party to this arbitration and could and does assert those rights. In any
case, the transfer would not extinguish Mr. Gosling’s rights. The Claimants also submit
that the restructuring of the Claimants’ investment in 2009 was due to the prohibition of

the Le Morne Project in violation of the BIT.” Accordingly, “Mauritius cannot therefore

rely on a consequence of its own internationally wrongful conduct to form an objection to

the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”*°

The Claimants argue that the BIT protects rights indirectly held by Mr. Gosling and PPD.
The Claimants dispute the relevance of the Barcelona Traction case relied on by the
Respondent and assert that indirectly held investments are not excluded given the ample
definition of “investment” as “every kind of asset” in Article 1(a) of the BIT and

Article 5(2) of the BIT, which contemplates treaty protection of indirectly held assets.*!

The Claimants next address the objection that the dispute does not relate to their
shareholdings and rights derived from them. According to the Claimants, the objection is
not a proper jurisdictional objection; even if the allegations made by the Respondent would
be established, the objection would not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. The Claimants
insist that their claims include expropriation of the Claimants’ investment, including the
shareholdings and contend that the destruction of a company’s assets necessarily results in

the destruction in the value of the shares in that company.*?

The Claimants also affirm that the funds expended by the Claimants in connection with the
Le Morne and Pointe Jér6me Projects are an integral part of the investments protected by
the BIT. The Claimants’ investment has to be looked at holistically. The Claimants affirm
that each of them held and contributed a different aspect of the investment made, as is the
nature of these projects.*? Furthermore, this objection is inconsequential as a matter of
jurisdiction, “To the extent Mauritius contests the fact that the Claimants expended funds
in connection with their investments in the Le Morne and Pointe Jéréme Project[s], this is

a matter relating to quantum not jurisdiction.”**

As regards the objection related to TGI as an investor, the Claimants contest the date on
which the Respondent assumes that the dispute crystallized. They also contest the
Respondent’s premise that each violation of the BIT occurred in September 2007.
According to the Claimants, TGI was incorporated on October 29, 2007 and the dispute
regarding the expropriation arose on November 16, 2007, when it became apparent that the
Respondent was stalling in the negotiations for compensation. The breach of Articles 2 and

3 of the BIT occurred later when LMDC/Rogers Group was treated more favourably.*°

The Claimants dispute that the Pointe Jér6me SHA was entered into only after Mauritius
cancelled the lease.*° They argue that it would not have made commercial sense, that
Mr. Gosling testifies otherwise, and that the Pointe Jér6me SHA was in force by August 1,
2007, which permitted it “to be amended together with clause 7.2 of the Pointe Jéréme

Share Purchase Agreement on that date.”*’

As to the Respondent’s argument that the share transfer pursuant to the Pointe Jér6me SPA
was not registered until after the dispute arose and did not produce effects in respect of
third parties, the Claimants argues that the SPA was a valid and binding instrument between
the parties to it, and only reflects a change in the form in which Mr. Gosling’s and PPDM
(UK)’s assets were invested.** The Claimants further contend that arguments made by PPH
against Mr. Tostée in domestic proceedings have no bearing on the jurisdiction of this
Tribunal and point out that “[n]o findings as to the invalidity of the Pointe Jér6me SPA

have been made by the Mauritian courts.”*?

The Claimants dispute the admissibility arguments advanced by the Respondent. The
doctrine of lis pending requires the triple identity test of parties, object and cause of action.

The Claimants observe that (i) the parties in the domestic proceedings - LMB and SMB -

are not parties in this arbitration; (ii) the cause of action is different: violation of property
rights under Mauritian law as opposed to breach of the BIT; and (iii) the relief sought in
the local proceedings and in this arbitration is not the same.*° The Claimants note, that to
the extent that the proceedings are related and arise from an overlapping factual matrix,
“TbJoth courts and tribunals have adequate tools to address any risk of inconsistent
judgments or double recovery. To the best of the Claimants’ knowledge, the proceedings
pending before the Mauritian Courts involving LMB are now in their 10" year, and this
Tribunal’s decision is overwhelmingly more likely to be issued before the proceedings in

Mauritius are finally determined.”*!

116. As to whether the proceedings have been commenced in bad faith, it is the Claimants’

contention that:

There is nothing abusive about these proceedings which the
Claimants have been forced to bring due to Mauritius’s continued
failure to provide compensation for the Claimants’ losses despite
Mauritius’s multiple and repeated acknowledgments that such
compensation is due. The fact that LMB and SBM are pursuing
separate claims before the domestic courts, under domestic law does
not change that conclusion, nor can it in any way suggest that this
arbitration has been brought in bad faith.°”

(4) The Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction

117. In its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent maintains the
arguments advanced in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, namely, that the Claimants: (i) never
acquired a right to the land at Le Morne or a right to develop it; (ii) never acquired a right
to shares in LMB; and (iii) never acquired enforceable contractual rights to returns under
the 2006 and 2009 Intermediary Agreements because they were void from the start for non-

compliance with the Non-Citizen (Property Restriction) Act.” In sum, the Respondent

contends that “the Le Morne Project was an empty and speculative mechanism to share

proceeds which were never generated from a project that never materialized.”

ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL

In its Decision on Bifurcation, the Tribunal noted that it was “not persuaded that upholding
some of the jurisdictional objections at a preliminary phase would materially narrow the
scope or complexity of the issues to be addressed at the merits phase.”®> Further, the

Tribunal believed that

[...] addressing the majority of the objections as a preliminary
matter would require an examination of facts and legal questions
that will also be relevant to the merits. For example, making a
determination on matters such as when the dispute arose, whether
certain contractual rights were contingent on approval, void ab
initio, or extinguished, and which entity or individual acquired what
rights, at what time, and in what manner, are likely to require
findings of facts and decisions on legal questions that may also
require examination at the merits phase. Thus, the majority of the
questions to be heard at the requested preliminary phase may be
intertwined with the merits of the dispute and may need to be joined
to the merits.”

After receipt of all the Parties’ submissions and following the Hearing, the Tribunal is in a
better position to address each of the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent in
respect of the Le Morne and Pointe Jéréme claims. The Respondent objects to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Le Morne claims on grounds that: (a) the Claimants lack
standing to assert BIT claims; (b) pre-investment expenditures are not protected by the
BIT; (c) the dispute is not related to Claimants’ shareholdings or rights arising from them;
and (d) the Claimant TGI was not a UK company before the dispute arose. The Tribunal

will first turn to each of those objections with regard to the Le Morne claims, and thereafter

°5 Procedural Order No. 6, para. 40.

will consider objections to jurisdiction over Pointe Jéréme claims and admissibility of

claims on grounds of lis pendens and abuse of rights.

(dd) Le Morne

a. Do the Alleged Contractual Rights Confer on Claimants Standing to Assert
Their BIT Claims?

120. The Respondent justifies the objection on the Claimants’ lack of standing on the following
grounds: (i) the Claimants’ contractual rights were not entered into in conformity with
Mauritian law; (ii) any rights and interests of PPH in LMB and the Le Morne Project had
been voluntarily extinguished; (iii) the Claimants did not have protected assets; and (iv)
Mr. Gosling and PPD cannot bring claims relating to rights under contracts of the

companies in which they hold shares.

(i) Were the Claimants’ Contractual Rights Illegal?

121. The Respondent has argued that the Claimants’ contractual rights were entered into in
violation of the Non-Citizens (Property Restriction) Act. As explained by the Claimants,
the 2004 Cooperation Agreement and 2006 Shareholders’ Agreement conferred rights to
control the Le Morne Project and receive priority returns. Under the Intermediary
Agreements, PPH was entitled to those rights as holder of shares in LMB if the PMO
approved or, if approval was not granted, as a beneficiary of contractual rights in relation
to the Le Morne Project under a promoter’s contract. The Claimants emphasize that the
Intermediary Agreements recognized that the acquisition of shares in LMB would require

PMO consent.
122. In the view of the Tribunal, the illegality objection lacks merit for the following reasons.

123. First, the Non-Citizen (Property Restriction) Act does not prohibit control. Article 3(1) of
the Act requires that the non-citizen obtain an authorization, if that non-citizen “wishes to

hold or purchase or otherwise acquire a property [...].”°” The Claimants did not “hold or

°” Republic of Mauritius, Non-Citizens (Property Restriction) Act of 1975, Act. No. 22/1975 (CL-003), Art. 3.

31

purchase or otherwise acquire a property” without authorization. That they controlled LMB

is not a situation which the Non-Citizens (Property Restriction) Act prohibited.°*

124. Second, pursuant to Article 5 of the Act, if there was a “contravention”, the Government
would either “take possession of the property” or “cause it to be sold.” The Respondent has
not taken any steps in that regard since the property (i.e., the land) was never in the
possession of the Claimants. No Government official or agency ever suggested that there
was any illegality with respect to the Non-Citizen (Property Restriction) Act or any other

laws.

125. Third, the 2006 Shareholders’ Agreement was a conditional agreement in the sense that the
Claimants would purchase/acquire the land only on the condition that PMO authorization
was granted. The Respondent’s expert, Prof. Seube, confirmed at the Hearing that it was
normal practice in Mauritius to enter into an agreement for the purchase or acquisition of
land on the condition that the PMO authorization would be granted: “Indeed, it is a very
frequent arrangement, the signing of a sales agreement under the condition that the

authorization from the Prime Minister be granted.”°?

126. Fourth, the Government agencies dealt with the Claimants over an extensive period with
respect to both the Le Morne and the Pointe Jérd6me Projects. With respect to the Le Morne
Project, the Government issued the LOIs knowing that UK investors were applying to
develop it.'°° The Government agencies themselves informed the Claimants that they
needed to obtain PMO authorization before the purchase of the land (through shares in
LMB). With respect to Pointe Jéréme, the situation is very similar. In paragraph 8 of his
February 16, 2006 letter to Mr. Wilkins, Mr. Ghurburrun stated explicitly that “Pointe
Jér6me Development Ltd has informed BOI, in its letter dated 14% February 2006, of its

development agreement made with Property Partnerships (Mauritius) Development Ltd

°8 See Tr. Day 6 for the replies of Prof. Seube to Prof. Alexandrov: pp. 1498ff.
® Tr. Day 6, 1496:13-16.

(MPP) on 08" December 2005 for the acquisition of 90% of the shares of the company.”!°!

In two other letters that Mr. Wilkins sent to Mr. Ghurburrun, one dated March 23, 2006,!
and another dated May 15, 2006,'° Mr. Wilkins provided details (including charts) of

Claimants’ corporate structure and the corporate structure of the Projects.

In sum, on the facts before the Tribunal, the Tribunal dismisses the allegations of illegality.
In view of this finding, the Tribunal does not need to engage in the debate on the relevance
of the absence in the BIT of an explicit requirement that the investment be made in

accordance with law.

(ii) Were the Claimants’ Contract Rights in LMB Relinquished?

The next ground for lack of standing argued by the Respondent concerns whether the
Claimants waived their rights to claims for BIT violation through the settlement under the
Consent Judgment.'*' The Respondent bases its argument on paragraph 10 of the

Judgment:

Whereas plaintiffs aver that the defendant no.1 [PPH] has, in
breach of contract, failed and neglected to fund the payment of the
balance of the sale price due, i.e. the amount of £2,180,655 with
interest, as well as the other amounts due to the plaintiff no.1 [SMB]
as set out in paragraph 4(d) above and has accordingly lost all of
its rights and interests in the defendant no.2 [LMB] to the plaintiffs,
in accordance with what has been commercially agreed between the
plaintiffs on the one hand and the defendants on the other hand.'°°

The Tribunal observes that this paragraph is not a waiver of BIT rights or claims, nor is it
a waiver of claims against the Respondent for any actions by the Government or its

agencies affecting the Claimants’ contractual rights. The Consent Judgment was concluded

132.

in March 2009, years after the alleged breaches of the BIT. For these reasons, the Tribunal

is unpersuaded by the Respondent’s argument.

(iii) Did the Claimants have BIT-Protected Assets?

The Respondent disputes that the Claimants had protected assets before the date of the
alleged breach. The Respondent restricts the BIT “investments” definition to rights in rem.
According to the Respondent, where rights to assets are claimed to arise under a contract
it must be shown that “those contracts give rise to property rights—rights in rem.”!°° This
restricted view of the term “assets” ignores the plain meaning of the BIT, which refers to
“every kind of asset.” Claims to money or performance under contracts may include

contracts for services and not only contracts for real estate.

The Respondent has also argued that a right does not qualify as an “asset” — as an
investment — if it is speculative or contingent. According to the Respondent, the asset “must
have vested specifically in a claimant before the date of the alleged breach. It is not
sufficient merely that a claimant can point to the possibility that the right might vest at

some future point, if a particular event occurs.” !°”

The Tribunal understands that, in the present context, “vested” is used in the sense of being
contrary to conditional or contingent, dependent on a future event. This is confirmed by
the case law quoted by the Respondent in support of its argument. In this respect, the 2004
Co-operation Agreement, the 2006 Shareholders’ Agreement, the 2006 Intermediary
Agreement and the 2009 Intermediary Agreement are not contingent in the sense argued
by the Respondent. They conferred contractual rights among their respective parties and
constitute the contractual structure for the investors to carry out the Le Morne Project. For
this project to become a reality, the Claimants needed the PMO authorization but also had
contemplated in the alternative a sponsor’s contract if that authorization was not
forthcoming. Under whichever alternative, the Claimants needed the permits listed in the

2005 LOI. In other words, they had a potential investment, based on their contractual rights,

106 Resp, Rej., para. 18, second bullet.
7 Resp. Rej., para. 18, third bullet.

34

133.

134.

135.

136.

in case they would obtain the necessary permits to develop their investment. The extent
that progress or lack of it in the realization of the Project implicated the responsibility of

the Respondent as argued by the Claimants is a matter for the merits.

The Respondent has also argued that none of the agreements is listed as an asset in the
Claimants’ financial statements. The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument. First,
whether and how contractual rights are shown in a company’s financial statements is a
matter of accounting rules and practice, which depend on the relevant jurisdiction. It is not
an indication of whether such rights exist or whether they are assets under the BIT’s

definition.

Second, there is evidence that the contractual rights were in fact reflected in PPH’s
financials. The note to the financial statements of December 31, 2006, under the rubric
“Investments”, states: “Additionally, the Company has entered into an agreement with the
sole shareholder of Le Morne Brabant IRS Co. Limited, pursuant to which the Company
has effective voting control. When the company receives the relevant Prime Minister[’]s
Office Authorization to hold the shares in Le Morne Brabant IRS Co. Limited that company
will issue new shares to the Company.” That statement is followed by the description of

the flow of the profits. !°

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that the arguments based on the alleged lack of potentially

protected assets prior to the date of the alleged breach have no merit.

(iv) Do Mr. Gosling and PPD have Standing to Assert Claims Based on
Contractual Rights Owned by PPH?
The Respondent has observed that Mr. Gosling and PPD are advancing their contractual
claims based on their status as direct or indirect shareholders in the companies that are
parties to the contracts for Le Morne, namely, the 2004 Co-operation Agreement, the 2006
Shareholders’ Agreement, and the 2009 Intermediary Agreement. Consequently, the
Respondent has argued that a shareholder of a company incorporated in the host State does

not have standing to pursue claims directly over the company’s contractual rights unless

‘08 PPH’s Annual Return dated July 27, 2007 (FL-002.3), p. 17.

35

there is a provision in the BIT protecting such rights. The Respondent bases its argument
on the fact that the BIT does not protect indirect investments and on the ICJ ruling in
Barcelona Traction.‘ The Claimants contest the relevance of Barcelona Traction and rely
on the wider interpretation of the definition of “investment” and on Article 5(2) of the BIT,

which contemplates precisely treaty protection to cover indirectly held assets.

137. The plain meaning of “any kind of asset” in Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT could not be more
general. “Any” means “every” in order to indicate “one selected without restriction.” The
term “kind” means “category” defined as “a group united by common traits or interests.” !!°

Thus, the text of Article 1(1)(a) itself means every category of assets. The fact that other

treaties may add a reference to “directly or indirectly owned or controlled assets” does not

mean that a limitation should be introduced into this BIT by this Tribunal when it is not
supported by the text of the BIT itself. This conclusion is reinforced by considering the
definition of investment in the context of Article 5(2) of the BIT that contemplates

compensation in case of expropriation of indirectly held assets.!!!

138. As regards Barcelona Traction, the Tribunal notes that this case has not been followed in
investment treaty cases. For instance, the GAMI tribunal did not accept the extension of the
Barcelona Traction rule beyond the issue of the right of espousal by diplomatic protection

and noted that “[t]he ICJ itself accepted in ELS/ that US shareholders of an Italian corporate

109 Barcelona Traction (RL-002).

10 See Merriam-Webster Dictionary, digital version; available at: https://www.merriam-webster.com/.

111 Article 5(2) of the BIT provides:
Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is
incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory,
and in which nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party own shares,
it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to
the extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation
in respect of their investment to such nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party who are owners of these shares.

entity could seise the international jurisdiction when seeking to hold Italy liable for alleged

violation of a treaty by way of measures imposed on that entity.”!'?

139. Similarly, the CMS tribunal observed that the ICJ case was “concerned only with the
exercise of diplomatic protection in that particular triangular setting, and involved what the
Court considered to be a relationship attached to municipal law, but it did not rule out the
possibility of extending protection to shareholders in a corporation in different contexts.
Specifically, the International Court of Justice was well aware of the new trends in respect
of the protection of foreign investors under the 1965 [ICSID] Convention and the bilateral
investment treaties related thereto.”''3 As equally noted by the CMS tribunal, “[i]n point
of fact, the [ELSI] decision evidences that the International Court of Justice itself accepted,
some years later, the protection of shareholders of a corporation by the State of their
nationality in spite of the fact that the affected corporation had a corporate personality
under the defendant State’s legislation.”''* It is notable that the Respondent has not

engaged in its argument with the ELS/ judgment.

140. It is apparent from the arguments of the Parties and the case law that the issue is not whether
the indirect investor may seek compensation for breaches of the BIT as if it were the local
company in which it has invested. Rather, the question is whether a foreign investor can
claim compensation for losses that it itself has suffered as shareholder in its interest in the
local company. Thus, the issue so articulated, the Tribunal has no doubt about its
competence to consider it, and it dismisses the objection related to the standing of Mr.

Gosling and PPD.

b. Do the Investment Disputes Relate to the Claimants’ Shareholdings or
Rights Arising from Them?
The Respondent argues that the Claimants do not show how the legal dispute concerning
their investment affects their shareholdings or rights flowing from them, “[nJor have
Claimants attempted to show how the alleged facts have diminished the value of their
shareholdings, let alone harmed rights inherent to their shareholder status.”!!5 The
Claimants confirm in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction that they claim for harm to
the shareholdings of Mr. Gosling, PPD and TGI, and explain that “for the sake of
completeness, the Claimants have now adduced expert evidence on the valuation of their
shareholdings and losses suffered to their equity value of the companies holding the
property interests as a result of Mauritius’s actions, to confirm the very basic fact that the
destruction of a company’s asset necessarily results in the destruction in the value of the

shares in that company.”!!¢

In its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent affirms that the sole issue is whether the
Claimants have shown the diminution in value of the shareholdings that the Claimants
claimed to be protected investments. The Respondent concludes that “[s]ince Claimants
have failed to show that the value of their shareholdings in the companies listed above
diminished as a result of the alleged wrongful conduct, the Tribunal should declare this

aspect of their claim inadmissible.”!!7

The issue here is not a matter of admissibility but of merits. Prima facie, the events leading
to the decision by the Respondent to forbid development in the Le Morne land owned by
LMB might have an impact in the value of the shareholdings. Whether they had such
impact and by how much are issues to be considered as part of liability and quantum, if the
Tribunal reaches these stages. As the GAM tribunal reasoned in the context of Article 1116
of NAFTA:

Req. for Bifurcation, para. 66.

46 C, C-Mem., para. 91.
417 Resp, Rej., para. 94.

38

144.

145.

[t]he fact that a host state does not explicitly interfere with share
ownership is not decisive. The issue is rather whether a breach of
NAFTA leads with sufficient directness to loss or damage in respect
of a given investment. Whether GAMI can establish such a prejudice
is a matter to be examined on the merits. Uncertainty in this regard
is not an obstacle to jurisdiction.'!8

   

c. Are the Funds Expended to Develop the Le Morne Project Protected
Investments?
This objection is incidental to the larger question of whether the Claimants had protected
investments, which has been dealt with above. The question for the Tribunal is whether the
expenses in preparation of the Le Morne Project are, by themselves, a protected investment.
The Respondent bases its objection on the fact that those expenses do not constitute assets
because “assets entail property rights (that is rights in rem).”!!° As already noted earlier,
the Claimants dispute the Respondent’s understanding of the term “assets” in the BIT and
affirm that the funds expended in connection with the Le Morne Project were an integral
part of the investments protected under the BIT. Based on the case law, the Claimants argue
that an investment must be looked at holistically and that their case is distinguishable from
Mihaly. '?° The Claimants explain that in that case the investor did not acquire contractual
rights to build, own and operate a power station, while “the funds expended by the
Claimants are an ‘investment’ in connection with the Le Morne Project for which the

Claimants did acquire contractual rights from the Government.” !?!

The Tribunal has already discussed the meaning of “assets” under the BIT and concluded
that the meaning of the term under the BIT is wider than argued by the Respondent. The
Tribunal further notes that its understanding of “investment” may include different
components that need to be pulled together to determine whether an investment has been
made. The Claimants have argued that their case is distinguishable from Mihaly, on the

basis that they acquired contractual rights from the Government. The Claimants are

Award, March 15, 2002 (“Mihaly”) (RL-064).

39

mistaken. As already concluded by the Tribunal, the Claimants did not acquire contractual
tights from the Government. In entering into the different contracts with private parties,
the Claimant acquired contractual rights that had the potential to become rights to develop
an investment, in case the relevant permits necessary to such development were obtained.
It should not be forgotten that the LOI was extremely clear concerning this aspect, as it

stated:

It should be understood that this letter does not in any way
whatsoever create any contractual relation between the Board of
Investment and Le Morne Brabant IRS Co. Ltd and the Board of
Investment will not be liable to any claim for compensation for any
expenditure incurred by the company in the event that the project is
not impl 1 as a consequence of the btention of any
permits and clearances required in furtherance of the realization of
the project or for any other reason not within the control of the
Board of Investment.'”

146. _ If the Tribunal were to conclude that the potential investment based on development rights

granted by the Respondent has materialized, then the funds expended to develop the project

would have to be considered as investments.

d. Is TGIa Protected Investor?

147. | The question in dispute is whether TGI existed before the dispute arose. It is not disputed
that TGI was incorporated on October 29, 2007, but the Parties hold different views on the
date on which the dispute arose. The Claimants argue that “‘as at 16 November 2007,
Mauritius’s violation of Article 5 of the BIT had not crystallized.” '?* This is the date when
the Claimants met with Mauritius’ officials because of the failure of Mauritius to pay
prompt, adequate and effective compensation for the taking of the Claimants’ investment
due to Revised PPG2. Further, the Claimants explained that TGI was already incorporated

when Mauritius violated Article 2 and Article 3 of the BIT, by “treating the Claimants less

favorably than LMDC/Rogers Group in compensation discussions and the offers made in

that regard.”!*4

On the other hand, the Respondent places the beginning of the dispute on September 24,
2007, when the Claimants sent MHL a letter, which the Respondent has characterized as
formally objecting to the decision to revise PPG2, and a follow-up letter sent on the
following day by the Claimants to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, in

which the Claimants formulated their compensation claims. !?°

The key element that triggered the dispute was the recently published Revised PPG2. The
Claimants consider piecemeal the consequences of this measure and relate them to distinct
obligations of the Respondent under the BIT. Thus, they separate the act of the alleged
taking under Article 5 from the compensation due or the treatment of the Claimants in the
negotiations that ensued. The Tribunal considers that this not a tenable premise. The
determining issue is the measure that caused the dispute. Even if the same facts may give
rise to different claims, it does not follow that there is a different dispute for each of the
claims. The Claimants seem to accept that TGI was not incorporated when the alleged
taking took place. The contemporaneous record does not support the argument that the
Claimants considered the negotiation related to compensation distinct from the alleged
taking by Revised PPG2. In the view of the Tribunal, the dispute arose on September 25,
2007, more than a month before TGI was incorporated, when the Claimants decided to
have the dispute solved by writing to the Government. Therefore, the Tribunal upholds the

jurisdictional objection in respect of TGI’s lack of standing in this proceeding.

(2) Pointe Jéréme

The Respondent has objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in respect of the Pointe
Jéré6me claims on grounds largely similar to those argued with respect to the Le Morne

claims. In addition, the Respondent has objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal vis-a-

vis the Pointe Jér6me claims on grounds of ratione temporis, because the alleged
contractual rights were acquired after the alleged breaches of the BIT in relation to Pointe
Jéréme. The Tribunal will consider this objection first. For this purpose, it will be useful

to recall the sequence of key events and their dates:

a. The Lease was signed on May 7, 2004.

b. The Pointe Jér6me SPA was dated October 25, 2005.

c. The share transfer forms were signed on December 8, 2005.

d. The time limit to start construction as extended for a “last” time expired on February 7,

2006.

e. The extension of that time limit was requested on August 1, 2006.

f. The Pointe Jér6me SHA was dated June 2007.

g. MHL cancelled the Lease on September 20, 2007.

h. The transfer of the shares under the Pointe Jéréme SHA was registered on April 28,

2008.

The Respondent has contested that the contractual rights claimed by the Claimants came
into existence before the alleged breach occurred on September 20, 2007. The Respondent
alleges that the Pointe Jér6me SHA had not been signed by that date. The Respondent relies
on the fact that the letter of MHL cancelling the Lease was addressed to PJD and MPP not
to PJD and PPH. The Respondent has also argued that the Claimants sought to declare the
Pointe Jéré6me SPA null and void in a lawsuit filed against Mr. Tostée in July 2010.
Furthermore, the Pointe Jér6me SPA was not registered until April 28, 2008, after the

dispute arose. Therefore, according to the Respondent, under Mauritian law, the Pointe

42

Jér6me SPA did not produce effects in respect of third parties, including the

2
Government. '7°

152. On the other hand, the Claimants dispute the contention that the Pointe Jéréme SHA was
not signed in June 2007. They adduce in support that: (i) Mr. Gosling confirmed that it was
signed in his Witness Statement; (ii) the Claimants’ in-house lawyer refers to an
amendment to the Lease in an email to Mr. Tostée dated June 29, 2007;'27 and (iii) the
Pointe Jér6me SHA was amended on August 1, 2007. The Claimants explain that on the
same date the Pointe Jér6me SPA was amended in order to postpone the date on which Mr.
Tostée could exercise his put option in respect of his 10% shareholding in PJD. This leads
the Claimants to conclude that the Pointe Jér6me SHA needed to have been signed by

August 1, 2007. 128

153. The evidence of the addressees of the Lease cancellation letter does not seem compelling
in order to determine who was the beneficial fiduciary of 90% of the shares in PJD. The
Pointe Jér6me SHA had been signed between Mr. Tostée and MPP. MPP acted under this
agreement to designate PPH as the party to acquire 90% of the shares. The letter only
proves that MHL was not informed of the designation of PPH as beneficiary of the shares.
The Tribunal is not aware that there was an obligation for the Parties to inform MHL. On
the other hand, and as a matter of logic, the evidence relied on by the Claimants seems

more convincing since an agreement needs to be concluded before it can be amended.

154. As regards the argument related to the Claimants’ allegations before the Supreme Court of
Mauritius in the case of PPH v. Mr. Tostée,'° in the view of the Tribunal, those allegations

were made before another tribunal considering a different matter and are of no import in

26 Resp. C-Mem., paras. 276 et seq.

the case before this Tribunal. In any case, the Supreme Court never decided the case, as

indicated by the Respondent, since PPH withdrew its lawsuit.'°?

To conclude, the Tribunal finds that the objection to jurisdiction vis-a-vis the Pointe Jér6me
claims on grounds that the Claimants’ contractual rights came into existence after the

alleged breach occurred lacks in merit.

The Respondent has also argued that, even if the Claimants had obtained shares in PJD or
SML before the critical date, the alleged right to develop the leasehold land lacked
substance because of the inherent conditions, and each condition was essential to allow the
development at the Pointe Jér6me. The Claimants had not taken any steps to fulfil these
conditions when the Lease was cancelled and the right to develop the leasehold land never
materialized. For this reason, the Respondent contends that the Claimants could have “no
basis to claim returns under the contractual framework they established under their Pointe
Jéréme SHA and SPA.”!3! But the issue is whether, if it had not been for the measures
allegedly taken by the Respondent in breach of the BIT, the returns would have been
materialized. The answer to this question depends on a finding by the Tribunal that the

Respondent breached the BIT and must be considered as part of the merits.

The Respondent further claims that the rights under the Pointe Jér6me SPA and the Pointe
Jér6me SHA were rights in personam, and none conferred property rights.!*? This
argument mirrors that made in respect of Le Morne. It is based on a narrow concept of
investment as defined in the BIT. The considerations of the Tribunal in that instance are

equally pertinent here and the Tribunal will not repeat them.

The Respondent contends that the Pointe Jér6me SPA had no effect in respect of third
parties. The Claimants assert that the Pointe Jér6me SPA was a binding instrument which

provided the Claimants with an interest in the shares enforceable by PPD (UK) against

130 Req. for Bifurcation, para. 47.

SML, its contractual counterparty. According to the Claimants, the registration of the
Pointe Jér6me SPA merely changed the form in which Mr. Gosling’s and PPDM (UK)’s
assets were invested.'** The question for the Tribunal is whether on September 20, 2007,
those assets, the alleged contractual rights, were opposable to the Respondent. In the view
of the Tribunal, this question is only relevant if the Tribunal finds that the Lease was
unlawfully cancelled by the Respondent and, therefore, will be considered as part of the

merits.

The Respondent has argued that, like in the case of Le Morne, the Claimants had no right
or interest in the company’s assets. Their property right was to the shares, their own shares.
As stated in considering this argument previously, “the question is whether a foreign
investor can claim compensation for losses that it itself has suffered as shareholder in its
interest in the local company. Thus, the issue articulated, the Tribunal has no doubt about
its competence to consider it, and it dismisses the objection related to the standing of

Mr. Gosling and PPD.”!*+

Next, the Respondent has argued that the Claimants have failed to show that their direct or
indirect shareholding in PPH diminished in value. For the reasons given in considering the
Le Morne claims, the Tribunal rejects this contention as a jurisdictional objection. This is

a matter to be dealt with as part of the quantum, if the Tribunal reaches this stage.

As in the case of the Le Morne claims, the Respondent argues that “[e]xpenditures by
themselves do not constitute a protected investment unless they are linked to a protected
investment. Simply spending money in the hope of one day acquiring a property right
cannot, of itself, amount to a property right, and thus a protected investment.”!* As in the
case of the parallel argument in respect of Le Morne, the question for the Tribunal is
whether the expenses incurred in Pointe Jéréme are part of a bigger whole that may have

been realized were it not for actions of the Respondent that, according to the Claimants,

83 Cl, C-Mem., para. 106.
84 See above paragraph 140.

85 Resp. Rej., para. 137 (emphasis in original).

45

162.

163.

164.

constitute a breach of the BIT. Therefore, this argument will be considered as part of the

merits, if such breach is determined by the Tribunal.

(3) Admissibility of the Claims

The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ claims in respect of the Le Morne Project are
inadmissible on grounds of lis pendens or, in any case, abuse of rights. On the lis pendens
question, the Respondent relies mainly on the recommendations of the “ILA Final Report
on Lis Pendens and Arbitration” (the “ILA Report”).'*° The Claimants base their
arguments on the triple identity test — identity of parties, cause of action and relief — and

question the relevance of the ILA Report recommendations.

The Tribunal observes that the BIT has no fork-in-the-road provision and it is not
persuaded by the arguments of the Respondent. Abundant jurisprudence shows that
tribunals have applied the triple test. On the other hand, the Respondent does not refer to
any investment treaty case where the recommendation of the ILA has been followed. It is
notable that the Respondent in its Reply on Jurisdiction failed to contest the arguments of
the Claimants’ rebuttal of the relevance of the ILA recommendations to the instant case.

The lis pendens and abuse of right arguments were not further discussed at the Hearing.

The parties in the Mauritius Supreme Court proceedings are SMB and LMB; neither is a
party to this proceeding. The causes of action are based on Mauritian law in the case of the
local proceedings, while in this proceeding the causes of action concern issues arising
under international law. As stated by the GAMI tribunal, “ultimately each jurisdiction is
responsible for the application of the law under which it exercises its mandate.”!*7 The
Respondent has affirmed that the relief sought by the Parties in the respective proceedings
is “essentially the same,” '** and that “the damage claims in both proceedings attempt to

quantify the losses allegedly suffered by the Le Morne Project as a whole.”'*? Given the

lack of parity of parties and causes of action, the overlap in possible compensation is not
by itself an issue that affects the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. It is a matter of potential double
recovery that may be taken into account at the time of calculating the quantum, if the

Tribunal reaches that stage.

The abuse of rights doctrine is based on bad faith. The case of Phoenix"? relied on by the
Respondent is a glaring example of bad faith. In that case, the claimant manipulated its
nationality in order to have standing before an ICSID tribunal after the start of the dispute.
Nothing of that sort has been adduced here, and no evidence has been submitted to show

that the Claimants had acted in bad faith.

weak

To conclude on the jurisdictional objections and allegations of inadmissibility:

(i) in respect of Le Morne, the Tribunal upholds the jurisdictional objection in respect of
TGI’s lack of standing in this proceeding, and dismisses the objections based on
illegality, relinquishment of contract rights in LMB, lack of protected assets and
inability of Mr. Gosling and PPD to claim that an interference with rights under
contracts of companies in which they hold shares have violated their rights as
shareholders. The Tribunal also dismisses allegations of inadmissibility related to

Claimants’ shareholdings or rights arising from them; and

(ii) in respect of Pointe Jér6me, the Tribunal dismisses the objection ratione temporis, the
objection related to the standing of Mr. Gosling and PPD, and the objection that the
rights under the SPA and the SHA did not confer property rights. It joins to the merits
the objections based on (i) lack of substance of the alleged right to develop the
leasehold, (ii) the allegation that contractual rights are not opposable to the Respondent,
(iii) the alleged failure of the Claimants to show diminished value in the direct or

indirect shareholding in PPH, and (iv) the alleged lack of a protected investment. The

LIABILITY

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES
(dd) The Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits
a. Le Morne

The Claimants claim that the Respondent breached Article 5(1) of the BIT by indirectly
expropriating their investment in Le Morne. According to the Claimants, the Respondent
changed its policy when it issued Revised PPG2 contrary to specific assurances to the
Claimants and the LOI. The Claimants contend that as a result of PPG2 their investment
lost most of its value. The Claimants affirm that the Respondent has acknowledged to them
publicly and to the International Council on Monuments and Sites (“ICOMOS”) (an
advisory body to UNESCO) that compensation would need to be provided, but none has

been paid.'*+!

The Claimants also assert that the Respondent also breached Article 2 of the BIT because
it has not complied with its promise to pay compensation to the Claimants, and did not treat
the Claimants fairly and equitably. The Claimants explain that under the obligation to treat
an investor fairly and equitably (“FET standard”), the Respondent needed to treat the
Claimants in accordance with due process, consistently, transparently and in an even-
handed manner. The Claimants argue that the Respondent frustrated their legitimate
expectations by failing to honor the specific assurances in the LOI and prior assurances
received from Government officials at the highest levels, assurances on which the
Claimants relied. The Claimants observe that the Respondent issued Revised PPG2 in a
hurry and without consulting them, which had been the prior practice of the Government

in matters of planning policy that affected them.'4? The Claimants insist on the

. Mem., Sec. IV.A.

169.

170.

inconsistency of the Respondent’s actions: “On the one hand, in December 2005, the
Government specifically assured that their development could proceed and the Board of
Investment issued the Claimants with a Letter of Intent. On the other hand, the Ministry of
Housing and Lands prohibited development on the Claimants’ land by issuing Revised

PPG2 in September 2007.”'

The Claimants finally argue that the discriminatory actions of the Respondent breached
Articles 2 and 3 of the BIT. They were contrary to the obligation to treat the Claimants
fairly and equitably under Article 2, and also contrary to the obligation to not afford less
favourable treatment to the Claimants’ investments than to the investments of Mauritian
nationals or nationals of third States under Article 3. The claim of discrimination is based
on the fact that Mauritian nationals (the LMDC/Rogers Group) and nationals of a third
State (Tatorio Holdings) were allowed to develop their land in the buffer zone
notwithstanding being in like circumstances, while development on the entirety of the
Claimants’ land was prohibited. Furthermore, in the case of the LMDC/Rogers Group, the
Government offered compensation for the part of the land where development was

prohibited by Revised PPG2.'##

b. Pointe Jéréme

The Claimants argue that the failure to extend the commencement period and the summary
cancellation of the Lease constitute unfair and inequitable treatment in breach of Article 2
of the BIT. The Respondent was not permitted under its own law to deny the extension and
cancel the Lease without good reason. The cancellation was also not in keeping with the
Respondent’s normal practice, which frustrated the legitimate expectations of the

Claimants. '4°

19 |

The Claimants also argue that by cancelling the Lease the Respondent deprived the
Claimants of the value of their investment and indirectly expropriated it. According to the
Claimants, “Without PJD’s leasehold interest in the site, the Claimants could no longer
develop the Pointe Jér6me site. The cancellation of the Lease rendered the Claimants’
contractual rights to acquire the shares in PJD under the Pointe Jér6me SPA and SHA

worthless, and permanently deprived the Claimants of the benefits of their investment.” !#°

The Claimants further argue that, by cancellation of the Lease, the Respondent meant to
gain leverage in its negotiations with the Claimants because the Lease was cancelled three
days after the Claimants were notified of the issuance of Revised PPG2, and the

Government proposed to reinstate the Pointe Jérome Lease “as part of '47

a land exchange
for Le Morne (the value of the leased land would be deducted from the compensation to be
paid in respect of Le Morne); the cancellation was counter the Government’s policy of
encouraging development. To this day, the Claimants have not been compensated and

Pointe Jéréme has not been rehabilitated. !4*

The Claimants argue that their investments were treated less favourably than those of
Mauritian nationals or of third States in violation of Article 3 of the BIT. In support, the
Claimants adduce examples of cases of industrial leases of investors in like circumstances
to the Claimants in which the Respondent did not insist on adherence to the commencement
periods. The Claimants also refer to the testimony of the former Permanent Secretary of
MHL before the Mauritian Supreme Court in which he affirmed that commencement

period clauses were not normally insisted upon. '4?

Finally, the Claimants also argue that the Respondent also breached the umbrella clause

under Article 2 of the BIT by (i) denying the extension of the commencement period and

wrongfully cancelling the Lease, and (ii) failing to reinstate the Lease or to issue a new

lease notwithstanding its undertakings to the Claimants in that respect. !°°

(2) The Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on the Merits
a. Le Morne

The Respondent affirms that it did not expropriate indirectly the alleged investments in Le
Morne for the following reasons. First, Revised PPG2 did not destroy the economic value
of the Claimants’ investment. The land can still be used for grazing and hunting, activities
for which it was used at the time the Claimants bought the land for 5.2 million pounds.!>!
The current value estimated by the Respondent’s appraiser — Mr. Feuerdent — is still
EUR 1.5 million without taking into account “the Claimants gaining control over
substantially valuable land through a land exchange with the Government.”!>? Thus,
according to the Respondent, the Le Morne land has retained at least a quarter of its fair
market value. The Respondent concludes that Claimants have not satisfied the “dispositive
element of an indirect expropriation claim: a regulation’s destruction of the value of an

investment.” !*3

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimants had no reasonable investment-backed
expectation that Mauritius would not limit development in pursuit of the goal of inscription
of Le Morne in the UNESCO World Heritage List.'!** The Respondent disputes the
Claimants’ assertions that the LOI constituted “a promise or specific assurance that the
Promoters could develop their Project irrespective of the efforts to inscribe Le Morne.”!*>
The Respondent explains that the LOI merely notes the willingness of the Government to
consider granting a developer the incentives specified in the IRS Regulations, and even

this is “subject to the developer’s acquisition of all required authorizations and permits

[...].”° Furthermore, BOI emphasized that the LOI was not of a contractual nature and
that BOI would not be liable for compensation claims if the project is not executed because
permits were not obtained. The Respondent concludes: “Since the Government never
promised Claimants that it would refrain from regulatory actions aimed at facilitating the
inscription of the site, even if its regulations, adopted for that purpose, might have
negatively impacted the Promoters’ proposed Project, the claim that PPG2 constituted an

indirect expropriation must fail.”!°”

Third, the Respondent asserts that PPG2 was “an appropriate, non-discriminatory exercise
of police power undertaken as part of a bona fide effort to achieve Mauritius’ long-standing
goal to inscribe Le Morne as a World Heritage Site. As such, it cannot constitute

expropriation under international law.”!°*

As regards the alleged breach of the umbrella clause, the Respondent asserts that it never
acknowledged obligations to compensate the Claimants for the issuance of PPG2, and that
it offered to the Claimants, like to the other private landowners, a land-exchange
mechanism, but the Claimants were unwilling to accept any of the Government’s good

faith proposals. !*?

The Respondent then addresses the claim of breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT. First, the
Respondent affirms that Article 2(2) does not require treatment beyond the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment. According to the Respondent, the plain
reading of the text of Article 2(2) supports the application of the minimum standard. The
Respondent contends that the Claimants are wrong as to the normative source: it is not the
practice of prior investment tribunals but the practice of States and opinio juris of which
the Claimants have not presented any evidence. The Respondent admits that it is generally
accepted that international law does recognize a principle that would give rise to an

obligation on the basis of what could be considered a legitimate expectation or a general,

self-standing duty of transparency. According to the Respondent, arbitrariness or
discrimination may lead to a breach of the minimum standard of treatment but, in the case
of arbitrariness, only in situations “where the action constitutes an unexpected and
shocking repudiation of a policy’s very purpose and goals, or otherwise grossly subverts a

domestic law or policy for an ulterior motive,”!

and, in the case of discrimination, only
when a measure targets a particular investor or investment based on nationality or other

characteristics.'°!

The Respondent affirms that the facts do not support the Claimants’ argument of the breach
of the FET obligation. Thus, the Claimants place great weight on the LOI and on the fact
that the sole condition with respect of the UNESCO inscription was compliance with the
parameters established in Dr. Abungu’s reports. But the Respondent explains that
Dr. Abungu’s report had been rejected as incomplete and had not been transmitted to the
World Heritage Committee about four months before the date of the Claimants’ investment
on June 30, 2006. Therefore, it was unreasonable to expect that the Government would

insist on the parameters in Dr. Abungu’s report. !°

The Respondent disputes the Claimants’ affirmation that at meetings with Government
officials the Claimants received assurances that they could develop the Le Morne Project.
On the contrary, they were told that the proposed project may not be compatible with the
nomination of Le Morne to the WHL.!® The Respondent also disputes the contention that
the Government did not consult the Claimants, and affirms that they were consulted
extensively on planning policy, but consultation does not mean that the Respondent needed
to agree with the Claimants’ views. In the view of the Respondent, “It is sufficient that the

developer has been made aware of the proposed regulatory measure and has been given an

opportunity to express its views to the relevant governmental authorities. That plainly

occurred [...].”!

 

As regards the Claimants’ argument of inconsistency in the Respondent’s actions, the
Respondent insists that its “administrative actions are perfectly reconcilable when viewed
in the context of the Government’s repeated assertions of its firm commitment to secure

the inscription of the Le Morne site.”!©

With respect to the Claimants’ argument that their alleged investments at Le Morne have
been discriminated against contrary to Article 3(1) of the BIT, the Respondent contends
that the Claimants misconstrue the scope of the Respondent’s obligations under Article 3
of the BIT because: (i) in the Claimants’ analysis of “like circumstances,” they rely
exclusively on decisions of tribunals under NAFTA and ignore that, in interpreting
similarly worded clauses in other BITs, tribunals have rejected the broad-brush “same
sector” approach in favor of “a broad coincidence of similarities covering a range of
factors;”!® and (ii) “the existence of a legitimate public policy objective on the part of the
State is not a mere afterthought in the analysis under Article 3 of the Treaty, but it is
fundamental to the identification of a comparator and the question of whether there has

been a difference in treatment.”!%7

The Respondent considers invalid the assumption of the Claimants that there was no
justification for different treatment of areas within the buffer zone. The Respondent
explains that the decision of prohibiting all development in Area E was justified because:
(i) in that area there were archaeological artifacts, (ii) the development would be highly
visible, (iii) Area E constitutes a bridge between Le Morne and the Black River mountain

range and Black River gorges, and (iv) it is a biodiversity corridor. None of these

considerations apply to Areas F and H (where Tatorio Holdings’ land was situated) or D
(where the LMDC/Rogers Group’s land was situated). The Respondent further explains
that it imposed conditions on the development of these areas. The developers considered

them so onerous that they decided not to proceed with their development plans. !°

185. |The Respondent dismisses the argument of different treatment in relation to compensation.
First, the fair compensation in the case of the LMDC/Rogers Group, who was allowed
partial development, would not necessarily be fair in the case of the Claimants. Second, no
land exchange was ever concluded with the LMDC/Rogers Group. Third, negotiations with

the Claimants for a land exchange failed because of LMB’s conduct.!?

b. Pointe Jéréme

186. The Respondent denies that it breached the fair and equitable treatment obligation in
relation to Pointe Jéréme. The Lease was cancelled because the Claimants breached
Article 14 of the Lease. The South Seas Development case on which the Claimants rely is

or by events beyond the Claimants’ control.!”° The Respondent disputes the date of the
alleged request for an extension. The Respondent points out that, on the date of January 23,
2006 used by the Claimants, they only notified BOI and not MHL of their intention to
request an extension. The Respondent recalls that at that time the BOT alerted the Claimants
that at that stage the MHL may not approve an amendment to the Pointe Jér6me Project.
Nonetheless, the Claimants presented to MHL a new project six months after the expiration
of the final extension deadline to start construction. But the indicative project proposal of
the Claimants lacked precision on the height, size and location of the buildings, situated

the development within the statutory setback from the high-water mark, and failed to

indicate the actions it proposed to take to widen the main access road and the relocation of

The Respondent affirms that the Claimants exaggerate their preparatory actions.
Furthermore, in the case before the Supreme Court in which Mr. Tostée and the Claimants

are parties, the Claimants blamed Mr. Tostée and not MHL for their predicament. !7?

The Respondent contends that cancellation of the Lease was in accordance with its own
established practice. The Respondent clarifies that, in the case of South Seas Development
on which the Claimants rely, Mr. Chan testified that the commencement period was not
normally, but not never, insisted on. According to the Respondent, “[a] request for a second
extension of the commencement period made (a) six months after the expiration of the
extended commencement period; (b) despite Claimants’ awareness that MHL had
pronounced the previous extension to have been the ‘final’ extension; (c) by a new
shareholder of which, until that point, MHL had not been informed; (d) who requested the
extension not on grounds of force majeure but because it had come to believe that the
project as designed by the leaseholder was not viable, was not considered ‘normal’ by
MHL, and Claimants have introduced no evidence to suggest that it was.”!73 Furthermore,
the practice described by Mr. Chan referred to industrial leases that had commencement
periods of six-months, not a realistic period to commence substantial construction as

opposed to the fifteen-month period in the Lease plus the first extension. !”4

The Respondent disputes the claim of expropriation. First, the Respondent explains that,
for a State to have expropriated an investor’s contractual rights, a claimant needs to
demonstrate that the State acted on the basis of superior governmental authority and not
pursuant to its rights under a contract. Second, in the instant case, the Respondent had the

contractual right to cancel the Lease.!”°

The Respondent also disputes the Claimants’ assertion that the cancellation was done to
gain leverage in the negotiations with the Claimants with respect to Le Morne. First, the
decision to cancel the Lease was taken not on September 20, 2007 but on May 12, 2007,
even before the issuance of the original PPG2 in June 2007. Second, “it was Claimants who
first suggested a land swap in which they would receive a freehold (not a leasehold) at
Pointe Jér6me in exchange for their land at Le Morne.”!”° Third, the decision was
consistent with the Government’s policy to require lessees to commence construction

within a specified period to prevent land speculation. !””

As to the claim of discrimination, the Respondent argues that the companies mentioned by
the Claimants were not in like circumstances. In one case, the lease was cancelled and in
the other two, the extension was granted because events beyond the control of the lessees
delayed construction. The Respondent adduces additional cases of lease cancellations for

failure to commence construction. !78

(3) The Claimants’ Reply on the Merits
a. Le Morne

As regards the claim of expropriation, the Claimants reiterate that Revised PPG2 destroyed
their investment because it prohibited outright the commercial activity underpinning its

value. The Claimants deny that they acted recklessly.'”? On the contrary, they

carried out extensive due diligence into the Le Morne Project, and
mitigated entirely the risk that the Government may elect to prohibit
development on the Le Morne land by engaging with the
Government, specifically requesting its confirmation that the Le
Morne Project could proceed notwithstanding the inscription
aspiration and alongside it. As part of that process, the Claimants
scaled down their proposed project in accordance with

Dr. Abungu’s recommendations, and obtained for it the approval of
the Cabinet and the LOI formalising that approval.'®°

In fact, the Claimants point out that Mauritius admits that the Claimants specifically sought
its “assurance prior to investing, and relies on the very correspondence in which it was
made clear to the Government that the Claimants intended to rely on the LOI in order to

invest, and that they would withdraw if it were not issued.” !8!

The Claimants recall that: (i) Dr. Abungu was recommended to the Respondent by
UNESCO and at the Respondent’s request to consider the Claimants’ project in light of the
inscription of Le Morne in the WHL;'* (ii) in his Second Report, Dr. Abungu “confirmed
that development should be permitted alongside inscription, subject to the Claimants
reducing the maximum number of villas to 65 and limiting the hotel to 35 rooms;”!** and
(iii) after considering the Le Morne Project, Dr. Abungu’s recommendations, the input of
Ministries and authorities concerned, the Claimants agreed to reduce the project to the size
set by Mr. Abungu, the Cabinet approved the project and directed the BOI to issue the
LOI.'* In the context of this factual background, it was reasonable for the Claimants to
rely on the LOI. Furthermore, “the BOI’s own Guidance makes clear that the issuance of a
LOI is a key stage of the approval process for any IRS projects and requires Cabinet

approval.” !85

The Claimants point out that UNESCO’s rejection of Mauritius’ dossier in March 2006
was not in any way related to the Claimants’ project and the Mauritian authorities never
suggested otherwise, nor did they withdraw or revise the conditions of the LOI. The dossier

was rejected because it was incomplete. !*°

The Claimants dispute the relevance of the purpose of Revised PPG2 in assessing whether
it was an expropriatory measure. They dispute that the Respondent’s measure fell within
the police powers exception and note that there is no exception in the BIT for expropriation
for a public purpose. Actually, according to the BIT, the Respondent may only lawfully
expropriate an investment if the expropriation is for a public purpose and the Respondent

pays prompt, adequate and effective compensation. '87

According to the Claimants, Revised PPG2 was not necessary but self-imposed. They

argue:

As is now clear from the documents Mauritius has been compelled
to produce in unredacted form through disclosure, Dr. Odendaal
was engaged by the Ministry of Arts and Culture on the basis that
half of his fees would be paid upon UNESCO’s acceptance of the
dossier. In these circumstances, and perhaps also by reason of his
partisan views and those of Dr. Bakker, as later explained by them
in an article, a complete prohibition of the Claimants’ development
at Le Morne was naturally a safer bet for a successful inscription of
Le Morne than a balanced approach that promotes both heritage
conservation and economic development. '*5

The Claimants contend that Revised PPG2 was not proportional to the State’s objective
and was not adopted in good faith. The Claimants argue that the process followed by
Mauritius “to enact the Revised PPG2 was non-consultative, deliberately opaque, and it

appears intended to prevent Claimants and other developers from participating.” !*?

On compensation, the Claimants assert, “Mauritius has always known and acknowledged
that it would be required to compensate the Claimants should it ultimately decide to
proceed with inscription without allowing the Claimants’ development. These consistent
and repeated acknowledgements have come from a diverse range of senior [G]overnment

officials, at different points in time.”!%°

The Claimants argue that the facts that sustain the argument of expropriation also give rise
to a breach of the FET standard. In this respect, the Claimants affirm that the FET standard
in the BIT requires the Respondent to treat the Claimants not merely in accordance with
the minimum standard of treatment and point out to the language in Article 2 of the BIT,
which refers “to ‘fair and equitable treatment’, not minimum standard of treatment or
customary international law.”!9! The Claimants contend that “even if Mauritius could,
despite the clear wording of the BIT and weight of authority, read the FET standard as the
minimum standard of treatment in accordance with customary international law, for all
practical purposes, in light of the evolution of the customary international law minimum
standard, the content of the standard and investment protections provided by it would be

similar.”!°

The Claimants reiterate their arguments on legitimate expectations and concentrate their
allegations on the inconsistent and unpredictable treatment of the Claimants’ investment.
According to the Claimants, “the policy of pursuing inscription alongside the Claimants’
development in accordance with the Mauritian Cabinet’s decision of 30 December 2005
and [the] LOI issued the same day, while subsequently changing that policy without
informing the Claimants, Mauritius deprived the Claimants of an opportunity to adopt a
commercial strategy that could be implemented over time despite their due diligence and
experience.” !°? In sum, the Claimants assert that the Respondent violated the FET standard
by failing to act in good faith.!*

The Claimants reiterate their claim of discrimination. They argue that they and the
LMDC/Rogers Group were in exactly the same circumstances: both were developers with
IRS projects in Le Morne, the projects overlapped with the buffer zone, the projects were
stopped by Revised PPG2, and both were offered by the Government to enter into a

settlement by way of a land exchange. The Claimants reject the argument of the

Respondent that the negotiations failed because the Claimants valued the land as if it had
development rights when it did not.'°° The Claimants re-affirm their position that they
indeed had development rights: the “Cabinet had approved their development and BOI had
granted an LOI. The Claimants’ scheme was compliant with the NDS and Outline Planning
Scheme. Any purchaser would have taken this into account for valuation purposes, as did
other purchasers in Mauritius who acquired sites whose developments were in the same
stage of the permitting process. The Claimants’ development was in fact more advanced

than LMDC/Rogers’, which did not have an LOI at the time Revised PPG2 was issued.” !%°

Because of their clear claims for expropriation and breach of the FET standard, the
Claimants manifest that they no longer pursue a claim for discrimination on the basis that
the Respondent permitted other developments at Le Morne nor their claims for breach of
the umbrella clause.!°” Nonetheless, the Claimants maintain the claim for discrimination
in respect of the compensation offered to other investors. As confirmed at the Hearing by
the Claimants: “There has been discrimination because others, specifically LMDC, have
been offered compensation in far more generous terms on a completely different basis to
us. They were the other significant private landowner; so, it’s a relevant and direct

comparison.”!°8

b. Pointe Jéréme

The Claimants argue that the Respondent violated the FET standard by discriminating
against them and by failing to afford them due process in administrative decision-making.
The Claimants affirm that they duly applied for an extension and advised the Government
through BIO on January 23, 2006, before the expiration of the commencement period, that

construction could not commence before mid-November 2006. The BOI did not indicate

that MHL may not approve the Pointe Jéréme Project, but that it may need to be issued

with a new LOL!”

The Claimants assert that, at the time the Lease was cancelled, the Respondent did not
justify the cancellation on the basis of any of the reasons advanced now by the Respondent,
namely, that the request was out of time, that the previous extension was final, that the
project had been changed or that the Claimants were land speculators. According to the

Claimants, these are all ex post facto excuses to justify an arbitrary decision.?”

The Claimants recall that, while their application was pending, the Respondent accepted
rent from the Claimants, withheld the decision for four months, and knew that the
Claimants had already expended in excess of GBP 1 million and the project was
progressing. In the circumstances, “the Claimants reasonably expected that they would be
consulted and afforded the opportunity to make representations in relation to any matters

that were genuinely of concern to the Ministry of Housing and Lands.”?°!

The Claimants also argue that the expropriation was unlawful. They contend that the
Respondent cancelled the Lease acting in its sovereign capacity because the Lease was not
a private contract: it concerned State land and the reference to “private contract” in the Pas
Géométriques Act merely means that the contract is not advertised to the public.
Furthermore, commencement periods for construction and cancellation pursuant a policy

against land speculation are indications that the contract was not private.”

The Claimants also insist that, for the same reasons that the Respondent breached the FET

standard, the expropriation of the Lease was unlawful as a matter of its governing law.?°

On discrimination, the Claimants argue that none of the grounds adduced by the
Respondent renders the circumstances of Pointe Jér6me exceptional nor were any of these
grounds used at the time of the cancellation. The instances of deadline extensions to start
construction which are part of the record show that such extensions were not normally
denied because of previous extensions.” Further, “[t]he fact that the Ministry of Housing
and Lands took legal advice over a four-month period after having made its decision before
notifying the Claimants suggests that it knew that there were no exceptional circumstances
warranting a departure from its normal practice. Including in light of the South Seas
decision that had recently been rendered at the time, this would necessarily have been a

real concern to the Ministry.”?°>

(4) The Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits
a. Le Morne

The Respondent recalls that its paramount policy objective at Le Morne was the inscription
of the mountain and its surroundings as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. According to the
Respondent, the Claimants have admitted that they were aware of this objective before they
made their plans to build a resort at Le Morne. As decided by UNESCO, it was impossible
for Mauritius to have both the UNESCO inscription of Le Morne and the Claimants’

Project.

The Respondent questions the reliance of the Claimants on Dr. Abungu’s recommendations
because they were based on incomplete information and UNESCO and its Advisory Bodies
differed from his opinion on the Claimants’ Project, as acknowledged by Dr. Abungu
himself. As explained by Dr. Odendaal, who prepared the second submission which was
accepted by UNESCO, the World Heritage Committee requested that the Government not

allow more development at Le Morne. The Respondent explains that Revised PPG2 was

adopted solely to satisfy UNESCO’s conditions for inscribing Le Morne and, hence, it was

consistent with the Respondent’s priority of obtaining UNESCO inscription of the site.”

The Respondent disputes that it ever would approve the Le Morne Project unless UNESCO
deemed it compatible with the inscription of Le Morne. The Respondent observes that the
Claimants ignore the advice of their own consultant, who in his EIA emphasized that many
people felt that development of the Peninsula should be stopped and that this sentiment

was in line with the initial standards set by UNESCO for the protection of the site.?°°

The Respondent confirms that the Advisory Bodies of UNESCO and in particular
ICOMOS, as well as the World Heritage Committee, were aware of the Claimants’ Le
Morne Project, which had been described in the dossiers of Dr. Abungu and

Dr. Odendaal.?

The Respondent takes exception to the accusation that Dr. Odendaal and Prof. Bakker were
partisan consultants because of the so-called “secret contingency fee.” The Respondent
clarifies that: (i) the second half of Dr. Odendaal’s fee was payable when UNESCO would
accept his submission as complete and not upon inscription of Le Morne as stated by the

Claimants, and (ii) it was paid long before he advised the Government on PPG2.?!°

The Respondent argues that PPG2 was not more restrictive than prior legislation, and that,
under that legislation, the Claimants would not have been allowed to develop the property

at Le Morne.”!!

The Respondent denies that Mauritius ever approved or authorized the project because the
Claimants needed: (i) approval of the PMO to acquire any interest in land, and (ii) to

acquire the right to develop the property through the issuance of a Building and Land Use

Permit by the local district council, which in turn requires other licenses and clearances.

The Claimants did not obtain any of these?!”

In the Respondent’s view, the reliance of the Claimants on the LOIs is mistaken because
LOIs do not constitute approvals of a project and explicitly identify the licenses and
clearances required prior the issuance of an investment certificate. Furthermore, there is no
evidence supporting the Claimants’ assertions that senior Government officials approved

the Le Morne Project.?!>

The Respondent explains that its interest in acquiring the land at Le Morne was not, as
argued by the Claimants, an indication that the Government would be required to pay
compensation for the prohibition of development at Le Morne. It was simply an offer to
trade or swap one parcel of land for another to protect Le Morne from development that

might be inconsistent with Le Morne’s character as a UNESCO World Heritage site.?!4

The Respondent clarifies that the claim of expropriation is not about taking of land but
rather about allegedly taken rights to develop the land, which, according to the Respondent,
never existed and could not be expropriated. The Respondent observes that the Claimants
themselves never recorded these supposed valuable rights as assets on their financial

statements.7!5

b. Pointe Jéréme

The Respondent contests the factual propositions on which the Claimants base their BIT
violation arguments. Contrary to the Claimants’ arguments, the cancellation of the Lease
was not a violation of the BIT because the Respondent had the right to cancel it, the

Claimants had failed to meet other conditions in the Lease besides failing to start

construction in time, and, despite its untimeliness, the second extension request was

considered carefully and in good faith.?'©

The Respondent disputes that there was any basis for Mr. Gosling to believe that the
construction period would naturally be extended as required. The Respondent insists that
the Minister acted on the basis of a memorandum of Mr. Seebun, the Deputy Chief

Surveyor at MHL, outlining the obligations that the Lessee had not fulfilled.?!”

According to the Respondent, the cancellation of the Lease was in consonance with prior
practice, and the Respondent argues that “Mr. Gosling himself recognized that Mauritius’
decision to cancel the lease was consistent with its prior practice, when he requested in
2009 that Mauritius provide him with freehold land instead of leasehold land ‘in view of
the large number of cases where Government has cancelled or attempted to cancel
leases.’”?'® The Respondent emphasizes that, contrary to the Claimants’ understanding,
Mr. Ujoodha’s evidence shows that MHL had exercised its power to cancel leases for

failure to start construction after the lessee had requested an extension.?!°

The Respondent affirms that the claim of breach of the FET standard fails under any
understanding of this standard. The Lease was cancelled lawfully. The Respondent disputes
that the extension request was filed on time on January 23, 2006, before the Lease expired.
The Respondent contests that the Claimants’ letter received at the time was a proper
application.””° The Respondent also contests that the actual application on August 1, 2006

provided “ample details;” in fact, it was only an “indicative project proposal.”??!

The Respondent asserts that the Lease cancellation did not violate due process. In answer
to the Claimants’ arguments, the Respondent refers to the process followed, and points out

that the Claimants never paid rent; rather, the rent was paid by PJD. The Respondent finds

unpersuasive the Claimants’ argument that it was unfair to cancel the Lease because MHL
was aware of the amount already spent on the Pointe Jéréme Project and the Project was
progressing. The Respondent questions whether the alleged expenditure was made and
whether the Project was progressing. The Respondent indicates that, at the time of the
alleged expenditure, the Claimants were aware that the construction commencement
deadline had expired, that the prior extension was final and, therefore, that the money was

spent at their own risk.?2

As regards expropriation, the Respondent re-affirms that cancellation by a State of “a
contract on the basis of its rights under that contract does not constitute expropriation under
international law.”??> The Respondent disputes the Claimants’ argument that the Lease was
not a private contract, adducing evidence of the Mauritius Supreme Court in support. The
Respondent also contests the notion that, because the Lease was issued by a Government
agency, it must have been for a public purpose. Similarly, the Respondent contests that
public policy objectives convert the exercise of a contractual right to terminate a contract
in an expropriation. The Respondent insists that it cancelled the Lease as a mere party to a

contract.?”4

The arguments of the Respondent on the claim of discrimination overlap substantially with
those advanced in relation to the alleged breach of the FET standard. The Tribunal
considers that there is no need to summarize them here and, to the extent necessary, they

will be specifically referred to in the Tribunal’s analysis.

ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL
(dd) Le Morne
a. Indirect Expropriation

The Claimants’ indirect expropriation claim is based on the effect that Revised PPG2 had

on the contractual rights of the Claimants. According to the Claimants, Revised PPG2

225

substantially deprived the Claimants of the use and value of those rights and the
Respondent has not paid compensation. The Respondent has questioned that the Claimants
had any contractual development rights because: (i) the Respondent never authorized or
approved the Le Morne Project, (ii) Revised PPG2 did not indirectly expropriate their
contractual rights because it did not destroy the value of the Claimants’ investment, (iii)
the Claimants were aware of the overriding policy objective of Mauritius to inscribe Le
Morne on UNESCO’s World Heritage List, and (iv) the nature of the regulatory measure
was a bona fide non-discriminatory measure. The Respondent recalls that the right to
develop land is conveyed by a Building and Land Use Permit by the local district that, in
the instant case, was the Black River District Council, which in turn requires other licenses

and clearances, none of which the Claimants obtained.

The first questions for the Tribunal to determine are whether the Claimants had
development rights in respect of the Le Morne Project and whether the alleged assurances
of the Respondent created reasonable expectations for the Claimants to invest. The
Claimants assert that they received assurances from the Government that the Le Morne
Project would be compatible with the UNESCO inscription process, and that the Cabinet
and BOI approved the Le Morne Project and encouraged the Claimants to proceed ahead
with it. According to the Claimants, these assurances were later frustrated by the

Respondent’s issuance of Revised PPG2.

As regards assurances received from the Government that the proposed project would be
compatible with the UNESCO inscription, the Claimants rely on the testimony of
Mr. Gosling and on a sequence of meetings with senior members of the Government and
their visits to the site. The only documentary evidence is an undated interview of the Prime
Minister published in a local magazine where the Prime Minister is quoted as saying that
the Le Morne Project is “extremely interesting.”?? The Minister did not mention UNESCO
or give any assurances. In the same article, the reporter commented that he did not see what

would stop the Project from taking off, but it would depend on the decision of the Le Morne

Heritage Trust Fund. Then, the article quotes Mr. Bertrand Giraud who refers to UNESCO
and affirms that he will do what UNESCO requires.

The meetings and visits referred to above were followed by a Fast Track Committee’s?”°
consideration of the Claimants’ revised application for an IRS investment certificate lodged
in June 2004, and the issuance of the 2005 LOI.’ The application had been revised in line
with Dr. Abungu’s recommendations. The Claimants place great significance on the LOI.
What does the LOI say? First, the LOI informs Mr. Giraud, as Managing Director of SMB,
that BOI has favourably considered the application for an investment certificate and
requests him to make arrangements for incorporation of a new company and to submit
certain documents within six months. Second, the LOI confirms that the project should be
in strict adherence to the recommendations of Dr. Abungu’s Reports. Third, it stipulates
that after the requested “documents are submitted, the issue of an Investment Certificate
under the Integrated Resort Scheme will be considered.”?”8 Fourth, the LOI makes clear
that the issuance of the Investment Certificate was subject to further submission of
documentation, including a land conversion permit, an EIA license, development and

building permits, etc. Fifth, the LOI ends with the following paragraph:

It should be understood that this letter does not in any way
whatsoever create any contractual relation between the Board of
Investment and Le Morne Brabant IRS Co. Ltd and the Board of
Investment will not be liable to any claim for compensation for any
expenditure incurred by the company in the event that the project is
not impl 1 as a consequence of the btention of any
permits and clearances required in furtherance of the realization of
the project or for any other reason not within the control of the
Board of Investment.”

This paragraph alone should be sufficient to show that the LOI did not confer any
development rights to the Claimants. It is consequent with the preceding paragraphs, which

indicate no more than a favourable disposition to consider the request for an Investment

Certificate after receipt of certain documents and then the Certificate itself would be subject
to submission of further documentation. There is no indication that this first step would be
followed by a favourable disposition to issuing the Investment Certificate. If there could

be any doubt, the last paragraph dispels it.

The Claimants have argued that this last paragraph of the LOI is limited to proceedings in
Mauritius, a matter disputed by the Respondent. There is no indication in the text of the
LOI on which to ground such limitation and no other provision of a legal instrument has

been adduced by the Claimants.

The next document relied on by the Claimants is the letter of BOI of June 2, 2006.?*° The
Claimants view this letter as confirming the LOI by “inviting [the Claimants] to submit the
plans, feasibility studies, and other documents set out in the Letter of Intent ‘to enable the
BOI to process the Investment Certificate.””™' It should be recalled that LMB had six
months to submit the first set of documents and the six-month period was expiring on
June 30, 2006. The June 2, 2006 letter starts by saying that it will consider “the issue of an
Investment Certificate to Le Morne Brabant IRS Co. Ltd once the following documents are
submitted [...].”2°? The list of the first set of documents follows. Then, the letter invites
LMB “to submit the requested documents as soon as possible so as to enable BOI to process
the Investment Certificate.”?** The letter also confirms that “the Investment Certificate, to
be issued pending submission of the proper documents, will be subject to terms and
conditions, among which [.. 84 The list of the second set of permits, EIA license, etc.,

In the view of the Tribunal, the letter is not a letter providing assurances, but is nothing

more than a reminder, a month before the time limit expired, to submit the first set of

documents needed by the BOI for further processing of the Investment Certificate, and to

remind LMB of the further conditions applicable to the Investment Certificate.

The Claimants conclude that “the decision of [the] Cabinet as confirmed by the BOT in its
Letter of Intent and follow-up letter created reasonable and legitimate expectations for the
Claimants that their project would proceed subject only to strict adherence with the three
reports of Dr. Abungu and compliance with the routine further conditions set out in the
Letter of Intent.”?°> According to the Claimants, on the basis of, and reliance on, the LOI,
the Claimants through PPH concluded contractual agreements with the local owners of the

Le Morne land on June 30, 2006.7

In between the issuance of the LOI on December 30, 2005, and June 30, 2006, UNESCO
twice rejected the dossier prepared by Dr. Abungu.?*’ The Respondent has argued that the
Claimants received no assurance from the Respondent after March 1, 2006 that
Dr. Abungu’s parameters would remain valid. While the Respondent highlights the lack of
diligence of the Claimants and their ignoring the rejection of Dr. Abungu’s prepared
dossier, the Tribunal fails to understand why the Respondent continued to request from the
Claimants the same documentation to process the Investment Certificate as requested five
months earlier notwithstanding the intervening UNESCO’s rejections. While the letter of
June 2, 2006 by itself is nothing more than a reminder, the rejections by UNESCO of
Dr. Abungu’s reports should have given the Claimants a hint that conditions may change.
On the other hand, the Respondent missed the opportunity to advise SMB of any possible
changes consequent with the decisions of UNESCO, if the Respondent envisaged any at
the time. For instance, the Respondent contends that “under the legal framework in force
at the time of their alleged investments, the issuance of development permits at Le Morne
would have required MAC’s approval, which, especially after the rejection of the first

nomination dossier in March 2006, would never have been forthcoming.”?**

The letter of June 2, 2006 may have given SMB the impression that there were no updates
necessary notwithstanding the UNESCO rejections, particularly in respect of the condition
that the investment should adhere strictly to the recommendations in the three reports of
Dr. Abungu. On the other hand, it should have been of some concern to the Claimants that
the recommendations to which they adjusted the Le Morne Project had not been approved
given the overall objective of the Government to inscribe Le Morne in the World Heritage
List. It is doubtful that the LOI and the letter of June 2, 2006 by themselves would have
been sufficient to generate, in a prudent businessman, expectations to proceed with an
investment such as the Claimants had planned to carry out. The reliance of the Claimants
seems misplaced. In their Reply, the Claimants themselves explain that in the 2004 Co-
operation Agreement?” they “committed to no more than preparing plans for the
development, and to incorporating a joint venture vehicle (the “IRS Co”, i.e., LMB) with
Mr. Giraud, which was only to proceed with the acquisition of the land ‘upon receipt of all
Government permissions, consents and permits required for the implementation and
development of an Integrated Resort Scheme on the Property.’ Had the Government not
granted the LOI, the Claimants would have pulled out, as Mr. Giraud was well aware and

”240 To consider that the LOI stands as an

equivalent to receiving all Government permissions, consent and permits is not supported

by the record in this proceeding.

At this point, it would be useful to return to the question of the Le Morne Project in the
context of UNESCO’s inscription process and the extent to which the Claimants were
assured that their project could be prepared in parallel. As early as September 30, 2004, at
a meeting chaired by the Prime Minister in which Mr. Giraud presented the Project,
Mr. Siew, SMB’s architect, under the item “Request from promoters,” stated that two

options could be considered:

1. The decision of UNESCO regarding the inclusion of Le Morne in
the list of World Heritage sites be awaited; or

238 2004 Co-operation Agreement, Clause 1.1(1) (C-012).
20 Cl. Reply, para. 67(d).

72

238.

2. The proposed project be allowed to be implemented taking into
account the guidelines and requirements of UNESCO. He added
that the promoters are agreeable to amend the Master Plan of the
project to be in line with the recommendations of UNESCO to
promote Le Morne as a heritage site.>*'

The Parties differ on whether a decision on this choice was requested from the Government,
as the Claimants interpret the minutes from this meeting to demonstrate, or it was a choice
for the Claimants’ prerogative to make, as the Respondent has argued. These different
understandings of the Minutes are relevant in the context of whether, at the request of the
Claimants’ architect, the Government considered that the Le Morne Project could progress
in parallel to the Le Morne UNESCO inscription. As noted, the two alternatives are placed
under the heading “Request from promoters.” Hence, it would seem that the Claimants’
interpretation is correct in terms of asking the Government for a choice, particularly when
read with the preceding sentence of Mr. Siew’s statement: “[T]he project proposal has
reached an advanced stage and [...] the approval of the government is being awaited for

the implementation of the project.”?4?

Evidently, the Prime Minister did not decide either
way at that meeting but he did hint at the risk of going ahead. Thus, immediately after the
Claimants’ architect spoke, the Prime Minister, under the heading of “Nomination of Le
Morne as World Heritage [S]ite,” “informed members that, as per Government decision,
the nomination of Le Morne as a World Heritage Site is being submitted to UNESCO. The
proposed IRS project may not be compatible with this nomination and the
recommendations of the UNESCO report.”?4? The Prime Minister had earlier informed the
Committee that “an IRS project was proposed by the Rogers Group on a different fagade
of Le Morne Mountain. However, following the recommendations of the UNESCO
Consultant of not allowing any development on the higher slopes [of] Le Morne Mountain,

the promoters had to drop the project, as it was no longer economically viable.”4* The

Minutes of this meeting show the paramount interest of the Government in the inscription

of the site in UNESCO’s World Heritage List.

The Claimants have also placed particular significance on the exchanges of Mr. Giraud and
the BOI in the months preceding the issuance of the 2005 LOI to show that the Claimants
relied on the LOI in order to invest and the Respondent was aware of this. The Claimants
refer as an example to Mr. Giraud’s letter of August 26, 2005 in which Mr. Giraud advised
BOI that the LOI was required because the Claimants “must give guarantees to their donors
that this project has obtained approval from the Mauritian authorities and to date we have
nothing!” The purpose of this letter was, inter alia, to “request a board meeting with all
concerned parties to explain the extreme urgency that must be brought to my application
to obtain the ‘Letter of Intent’ from the B.O.L., a project that was submitted on 23 June

2004 and which to date has remained unanswered.”*°

A Fast Track Committee meeting was held on September 8, 2005 to discuss the Le Morne
Project among others. The Minutes record that the final report of Dr. Abungu was not yet
submitted, show that some members had expressed some doubt on the probability of listing
Le Morne as a World Heritage Site, and also show that Mr. Giraud was in attendance and
the Prime Minister informed him that “a decision would be taken on the project in the light
of Dr. Abungu’s final report.”°47 A few days later, the Managing Director of BOI wrote to
Mr. Giraud to thank him for his presentation to the Fast Track Committee and inform him
that a meeting will be arranged “to discuss the implications of the recommendations of the
UNESCO report regarding your project.”4* After Dr. Abungu’s Second Report,
Mr. Giraud had a number of comments on and criticisms to the recommendations.”””
Dr. Abungu discussed those with the Minister of Arts and Culture “with a view to reaching

a solution that is appropriate for the site as well as leaving room for development.””°° A

second Fast Track Committee meeting was held on November 16, 2005. Dr. Abungu’s
counter-proposal was discussed with Mr. Giraud at a BOI meeting the day before and
Mr. Giraud opposed it. However, on December 18, 2005, Mr. Giraud changed his mind
and informed Mr. Jaddoo of BOI that:

I think that I am now willing to accept this proposal because my
entire project is now in danger; MY ENGLISH PARTNERS HAVE
CLEARLY LET ME KNOW THAT IF BOI DOES NOT DELIVER
THE L.O.1 BEFORE THE END OF THIS YEAR, THEY WILL

Once the LOI is obtained, we will have more time to explain to
various parties the validity of our arguments and make necessary
changes to our project!™!

This communication ends with a plea for the issuance of the LOI shortly: “[I]f I don’t
receive the letter of intent in the coming days, my partners will drop everything, I'll end up
bankrupt and I’ll [be] forced to safeguard my rights in court. No one wants such an
outcome.”?°? This email was followed up by a formal letter next day.” In view of the
acceptance of the proposal by SMB, BOI requested, on December 20, 2005, the greenlight
from MAC to issue the LOI. On December 30, 2005, MAC replied to the letter of
December 20, 2005, by informing BOI that the Government has on that day “approved the
recommendations of Dr. Abungu, UNESCO Expert, in respect of the above project [the
SMB IRS Project at Le Morne], which will comprise the construction of 65 villas, a hotel
of 35 rooms, a small restaurant and a golf course of 18 holes with a small club house.”2>>
The letter advises that the recommendations of the three Abungu reports need to be strictly

adhered to and adds that “[t]he core and buffer zones of Le Morne, as delimited by

Dr. Abungu in plan at Annex IV, have been approved for the Nomination Dossier for the

inscription of Le Morne on the World Heritage List.”

The interactions of SMB prior to December 30, 2005 and the intra-Government
communications show that pertinent Government parties had been involved in the
proceedings leading up to the LOI. While these interactions do not mean that BOI approved
more than what the text of the LOI says, they indicate that the Government was fully aware
of the predicament of Mr. Giraud in relation to his partners, that the Le Morne Project could
continue to proceed subject to certain conditions and safeguards, and that the Government
was ready at least to permit some development in the buffer zone as delimited by
Dr. Abungu. But the fact remains that the LOI expired six months later without being
extended and without the Claimants having fulfilled the conditions for issuance of an
Investment Certificate. In fact, no Investment Certificate was ever issued nor did the BOI
ever consider it after June 30, 2006. Furthermore, the Claimants did not acquire
development rights, interference with which may have given rise to a justifiable claim for
compensation. In view of this conclusion, the Tribunal does not need to consider the

remainder of the Claimants’ arguments in respect of their claim of indirect expropriation.

b. Breach of Fair and Equitable Treatment
(i) Scope
The Parties differ on whether the FET is an autonomous standard or it requires merely the
minimum standard of treatment under international law. The Tribunal questions the
relevance of the differentiation. Whether it is considered equivalent to the minimum
standard of treatment or an autonomous standard, the level of the treatment required to
breach the standard has evolved. What was considered minimum treatment in the
nineteenth century is not the minimum required in the twenty-first, particularly in the

context of a treaty specifically providing for fair and equitable treatment.

248.

Given the wide variety of situations to which fair and equitable treatment may be
applicable, there is no comprehensive definition of the FET standard. The standard is “a
flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.”2>7 However,
flexibility does not mean that treatment will be determined by the subjective expectations
of the investors. Their expectations “to be protected, must rise to the level of legitimacy

and reasonableness in light of the circumstances.”?*

As pointed out by other tribunals, the fair and equitable treatment obligation needs to be

interpreted in a balanced manner. As stated by the E/ Paso tribunal:

This Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed,
taking into account both State sovereignty and the State’s
responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for
the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect
foreign investment and its continuing flow.?*?

To sum up, the Tribunal understands fair and equitable treatment to mean treatment that
objectively will be considered just by an impartial observer bearing in mind the

circumstances.

(ii) Application of the FET standard to the facts

The Claimants rely here on the same facts to claim breach of the FET standard as they did
in their claim for indirect expropriation. On these facts, the Claimants contend that the
Respondent frustrated their treaty-protected legitimate expectations, treated the Claimants’

investment inconsistently and unpredictably, and failed to act in good faith.

The Tribunal has just reviewed and rejected the claim of indirect expropriation. The
considerations that led the Tribunal to this conclusion are equally valid here and there is

no need to repeat them. The Claimants have based their contention of inconsistent and

unpredictable treatment on the change in policy of the Respondent in respect of
development in the buffer zone and associated with this contention is the argument that the

Respondent failed to act in good faith.

The Respondent’s objective had always been to inscribe Le Morne as a heritage site. The
Claimants were aware of this objective. The Claimants pressed BOI to issue the LOI for
their own internal arrangements and those of Mr. Giraud with his family. The Respondent
was entitled to change its policy in respect of development in Le Morne and had never
given any assurance that it would not change it. The change in policy as regards the buffer
sub-zones needs to be assessed in the context of the progress made by the Claimants in
obtaining all the permits required for the Le Morne Project. By the time Revised PPG2 was
issued, the Claimants had not obtained the permits necessary for BOI to consider the
issuance of an Investment Certificate. In fact, the LOI had expired more than a year earlier,
and the Claimants had not obtained the permits from the local authorities in charge of

issuing development rights.

The claim of failure to act in good faith is based on the alleged secrecy and lack of
consultation before Revised PPG2 was issued. The lack of consultation is disputed by the
Respondent. Mr. Odendaal describes the consultations with developers in his witness
statement: “Although the various developers and landowners seldom attended the public
meetings organized by the Government, the Government specifically arranged so that I
could meet with them and learn about their projects. Indeed, the Government was very
proactive in setting up meetings with developers, even though it was not necessary for them
to express their views directly to me (they could interact with the Government instead).”?
The Claimants did interact with the Government.”*! It seems from the record that the issue
was not one of lack of consultation but that the Claimants confused “non-consultative”

99262

with “not agreeing to our project or aspects of it. In view of these considerations, the

Tribunal finds that the lack of good faith claim is not sustained by the evidence, and there

is no merit in the claim that the Respondent breached the FET standard.

c. Discrimination

The Claimants in their Reply on the Merits state that, “[i]n light of, inter alia, the fact that
the Claimants have a clear claim for expropriation of their Le Morne investments, as well
as for breach of the FET standard and non-discrimination standard [...] in the interest of
narrowing the issues in dispute, the Claimants no longer pursue a claim for discrimination
on the basis that Mauritius permitted other developments at Le Morne while prohibiting

the Claimants.”

Before the Claimants amended their discrimination claim, they had advanced
discrimination on two grounds: (i) development was permitted by the Government in other
owners’ land within the buffer zone (Tatorio Holdings and LMDC/Rogers Group), and (ii)
a local developer (LMDC/Rogers Group) was offered fair compensation and no such offer
was made to the Claimants. Thus, after the amendment, the discrimination claim has been
reduced to discrimination in the compensation offered. Nonetheless, considerations on
whether the other investor was in like circumstances still apply because differences in
compensation were related to whether, under Revised PPG2, development was allowed in

a particular sub-zone.

The Parties first disagree on the interpretation of “like circumstances,” whether it means
“the same sector” or “a broad coincidence of similarities covering a range of factors.” The
Respondent has taken exception to the use by the Claimants of the case law of NAFTA,
because NAFTA jurisprudence is based on a context of trade law, and the fact that the
project and business sectors may be relevant in the trade law context, but, as held in
Bayindir, “[uJnder a free-standing test, however, such as the one applied here, that degree
of identity does not suffice to displace the differences between the two contractual

relationships.” The Respondent also takes exception to the Claimants’ argument that

79

254.

255.

256.

once the difference in treatment is established, then it is for the Respondent to provide a
rational justification for the difference in treatment. The Respondent insists that it offered
compensation to LMB, but this did not lead to an agreement because LMB repeatedly
changed its position and insisted on the land at Le Morne to be valued for exchange

purposes as if LMB had development rights.

The Tribunal points out that NAFTA jurisprudence may be persuasive in a wider context
than NAFTA cases and is not limited to the identity of economic or business sectors. The
Tribunal considers that, in the instant case, the circumstances adduced by the Claimants to
establish that other developments were in similar situation are valid comparators: sector
identity, IRS projects and location in the buffer zone. The analysis of the Claimants stops
here, but the Respondent goes deeper to identify particularities that allegedly justify
different treatment. The division of the buffer zone in sub-zones by Revised PPG2 was
justified by objective criteria of fauna, flora, and visual integrity on the basis of the
recommendations of the UNESCO’s experts. The location of other developers’ land was
in different sub-zones from LMB’s land. In this respect, LMB’s land was not in like

circumstances.

The Tribunal has already determined that the 2005 LOI did not confer to SMB development
rights. Therefore, it would not be congruent with this determination to consider that
development rights should be part of the valuation for a land exchange. This
notwithstanding, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent offered compensation not on the
basis of opportunities lost but based on what were the rights that owners may have had
under PPG2. Thus, the Respondent has argued that “development, albeit limited, on
LMDC/Rogers’s land was permissible under PPG2. In contrast, development was not
permissible on LMB’s land. What is ‘fair’ compensation for LMDC/Rogers’s land,

accordingly, would not necessarily be fair for LMB’s land.”

The alleged discrimination argument fails because the Respondent applied the same gage

to measure compensation for land in the buffer zone. Compensation depended on the

265 Resp. C-Mem., para. 408.

80

257.

258.

259.

opportunities for development in the different buffer sub-zones under Revised PPG2. This
is consequent with the purpose of the land exchanges pursued by the Respondent in which
the valuation proposals were discussed. Land was valued not to assess the impact of
Revised PPG2 but to value the land as it was at the time of the exchange after adoption of

PPG2.

(2) Pointe Jéréme

The Claimants assert that the Respondent has breached its obligations under the BIT in
respect of the Claimants’ investment at Pointe Jér6me on account of unfair, inequitable,
and discriminatory treatment and by expropriating it indirectly. The Tribunal will consider

first the discrimination claim.

a. Discrimination

It has been a matter of dispute between the Parties whether the cancellation of the Lease
was conforming to past practice. The Claimants rely on the testimony of Mr. Chan Wan,
ex-Permanent Secretary of MHL, in the South Seas Development case. Mr. Chan Wan
testified that the start of the construction deadline in the instance of a six-month
commencement period would not normally be insisted on because each case would be
taken on its own merits.” On the other hand, the Respondent stresses that it had the right
to cancel the Lease and there is no support for the argument that this right could only be

exercised in exceptional circumstances.

The cases discussed by the Parties show that each case was taken on its own merits, but do
not support the conclusion that the deadline to start construction was not normally insisted
on. Differences between the instant case and the cases adduced by the Claimants in support
of their claim of discrimination have been explained by the Respondent. With regards to

Subco, the developer commenced construction in time but construction was delayed by a

court case.”°” For Osprey, by the time Osprey requested an extension, it had applied for the
necessary permits and all other clearances had been obtained.”® In contrast, the Claimants
had not applied for a single permit by the time they requested the extension. Concerning
Hassamal, the lessee faced circumstances beyond its control.76° For New Mauritius Hotel,
the extension of the deadline to start construction was final and was not extended; the

extension granted referred to the deadline for completion of the construction.?”°

The Claimants had questioned whether the lessees in the cases relied on by the Respondent
had requested an extension when their leases were cancelled. In its Rejoinder on the Merits,
the Respondent explains that, in the case of Aquarius Village, the lease was cancelled and
the lessee requested MHL to reconsider the cancellation but MHL decided to maintain the
decision.?’! Regarding Ra & Si, the Government cancelled the lease with the extension
request pending.””” The industrial lease held by Mr. Seeruthum was cancelled while there

was a pending extension request.””?

The Tribunal concludes that there is no basis for the discrimination claim. The review of
the instances on which the Claimants have based their claim of discrimination shows that
each of the cases can be distinguished from the case before the Tribunal and also shows
that there was no practice of extending routinely the period to start construction. The
Claimants were aware of the risk that they ran. BOI’s letter of February 16, 2006 (nine
days after the deadline had expired) drew the attention of the Claimants to “the fact that
amendment of the Pointe Jéréme Project at this stage may question the validity of the Letter

of Intent issued by BOI and the various permits and clearances granted by different

Government bodies.”?”4 Mr. Gosling himself was aware that the Government had cancelled
or attempted to cancel leases in “a large number of cases.” For this reason, he requested

that the LMB property be exchanged against freehold State land.?”>

b. Fair and Equitable Treatment

The Tribunal has set out its understanding of this BIT obligation in considering the claims
related to Le Morne and will not repeat it here. The Claimants based their arguments of
breach of the FET standard on difference of treatment, unlawful cancellation and lack of
due process. The Tribunal has already considered and rejected whether the Respondent
subjected the Claimants to discriminatory treatment and will consider the other two

grounds next.

The Lease was cancelled on the basis of Article 14. The Respondent had the right to cancel
it, if certain conditions had not been met. The Respondent relied on the undisputed fact that
construction had not started. Mr. Gosling, in the negotiations with Respondent after the
Lease cancellation, accepted that “we were technically in breach of the lease by not
commencing construction on site.”?”° Mr. Gosling attributed it to the fact that, “in the
period leading up to the [L]ease being rescinded, all of our efforts were being diverted into
trying to reach accommodation with [the] Government on reconciling our proposed
development at Le Morne with the UNESCO application [...].”?”” In an email from MPP
to Mr. Ghurburrun, Mr. Wilkins says that “at present the start date in the lease is mid-

actually requested an extension seven months later on August 1, 2006,?*? which confirms
that they themselves saw the need to submit a request beyond the communication of
January 23, 2006. When they finally did so, the Claimants presented an indicative project
proposal but had not yet applied for any of the required permits, including the planning

permission and the EIA license.

The Claimants have also argued as part of the breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT that the
cancellation violated due process by summarily dismissing the request, accepting rent from
the Claimants and cancelling the Lease notwithstanding MHL being on notice about the
amount already spent by the Claimants in the Pointe Jér6me Project. The Respondent
rebuts these arguments by pointing out the careful attention that the request merited from
the authorities and that it never accepted rent from the Claimants but only from the
leaseholder. Furthermore, the Respondent questions whether the alleged expenditure was

actually made.

The documentation for the period between January 2006 and September 2007 is scarce.
The Tribunal will refer to each of the documents available. On March 8, 2007, the
Permanent Secretary of MHL chaired a meeting with representatives of, among others,
BOI to consider projects submitted by BOI. The minutes of the meeting consist of a table
of the pending projects showing the status of each project followed by remarks. The status

of the Pointe Jér6me Project is described in these terms: “[c]onsideration is being given for

the extension of the period of reservation.” Under “remarks”, the minutes record that “[t]he
chairperson pointed out that normally when land is allocated, the Promoter is granted a
delay to start construction. So far nothing has been done on site for that particular project.
He equally added that when the promoter sells their project, there is a change in the
ownership which automatically results in the cancellation of the lease as per Government
decision. The implications will also have to be looked into.”?*+ There is no record whether
this matter was considered further. At the time of this meeting, the Government had been
aware of the development agreement for the purchase of the PJD shares since it was noted

in the letter of Mr. Ghurburrun to Mr. Wilkins of February 16, 2007.785

The next document, titled on its face “minutes” but reading as an internal memorandum, is
addressed from Mr. Seebun to Mr. Conhye and is dated March 19, 2007.78 This document
gives the background to PJD’s request, the relevant terms of the Lease and three
“observations” related to pending matters: the relocation of two persons, agreement with
lessees of the land needed to widen the road and failure to commence construction. It
concludes by pointing out that a decision is required as to whether to grant a last and final
extension up to August 6, 2007, whilst taking into consideration the issues raised above.
There is an additional handwritten paragraph, dated March 27, 2007, saying the
memorandum was being “submitted for approval, please.” This memo was submitted by
Mr. Conhye to the Permanent Secretary and the Minister with a further handwritten note
expressing support for granting a final extension to the company to deal with the issues set

forth by Mr. Seebun. It seems that the fact that the previous extension had been “final” was

no obstacle to staff of MHL to support a further extension.7*” Next in the record is a
handwritten note of the Permanent Secretary to the Minister of Housing and Lands dated
April 4, 2007, transmitting Mr. Seebun’s memo. This note says, “[y]ou may wish to
discuss. Please.”?8® On May 12, 2007, the Minister wrote: “Please cancel lease as lessee
has not fulfilled the conditions as agreed. Please consider to reallocate the land to a bona-

fide developer.”?*

While the record shows that the request of the Claimants had been considered by the
various ministries and BOI, the Minister did not pay any heed to the recommendation of
the staff. There is no record of any discussion of the recommendation with the Permanent
Secretary or anyone else. Nonetheless, the Minister of Housing and Lands decided on the
basis of the minutes of Mr. Conhye, which listed the conditions of the Lease that had not
yet been fulfilled by the Lessee. In its laconic order, the Minister precisely referred to those

conditions.

The Claimants have relied on the fact that the rent for the Lease was paid and accepted by
the Respondent until the Lease was cancelled. The Respondent has explained that the rent
was paid by PJD and not the Claimants, and the Respondent was entitled by the terms of
the Lease to accept the rent of PJD pending consideration of the extension. Further, the rent
was paid annually in advance and cancellation under Article 14(a) of the Lease did not

entitle the lessee to a refund of any portion of rent paid in advance.

The third ground for lack of due process argued by the Claimants is the fact that they had
expended in excess of GBP 1 million on the Pointe Jéréme Project. The Respondent
questions whether the expenditure was made as well as the progress in preparing the

Project. Furthermore, funds were expended without any assurance from the Respondent

a

number of industrial leases where an extension to the commencement period has been described as a ‘final’ extension,
but this did not prevent the granting of further extensions where doing so served with the Ministry’s objective of
ensuring that the site be developed”: Naidoo Witness Statement, para. 10.

that the extension would be granted and the Claimants were on notice that the current

extension was “final.”

In the view of the Tribunal, the Claimants invested in a potential project knowing that it
depended on a lease in which the construction commencement deadline was expiring
within two months, the current extension had been labelled “final,” and, under the terms of
the Lease, this could be cause for cancellation. Notwithstanding the Claimants’ assertions
of continuing progress in the preparation of the Pointe Jér6me Project, none of the

additional permits had even been requested by the time the Lease was cancelled.?°°

It is surprising that the Government would take thirteen months to make a decision on the
request for an extension and then that the decision would not be communicated to the
requester for four months, even if legal advice was sought. During this time, there were no
interactions with the investors, no further information was requested, no meetings with the
authorities were convened, no indication on the administrative progress of the request was

given. There is no record either that the Claimants bothered to inquire.

While the process could be improved, the Respondent was within its contractual rights to
cancel the Lease and the Claimants had not been given any indication that it would be
extended. In fact, they had been warned as early as February 2006 that a new set of permits
would be required if they revised the Project. This notwithstanding, the Claimants revised
the project and only submitted an “indicative project.” It is a risk the Claimants took, for
which the Respondent is not liable. The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent did not
breach Article 2(2) of the BIT.

c. Indirect Expropriation

Claimants base their claim for indirect expropriation on the unlawful cancellation of the
Lease and on Mauritius acting in its sovereign capacity. The Tribunal has already rejected

the allegation that the cancellation was unlawful and will consider here only whether the

299 See Resp. Rej., para.124: The “Claimants never applied for an EIA Licence or any of the statutory permits required
to allow development at the site. Without even applying for, let alone obtaining, such permits, they had no legal basis
for carrying out any development at the site. The luxury hotel complex, and their proposed investment in it, remained
nothing but pie in the sky.”

87

274.

275.

Respondent acted as a sovereign. In this respect, the Claimants argue that the Lease was
not a private contract and the decision to cancel it was an exercise of the Respondent’s
sovereign policy-based rights. Indeed, the Lease concerned State land and it was granted
pursuant to the Government’s policy of encouraging development in the tourism sector.
The Claimants rely also on the fact that an industrial lease sets commencement periods for
construction and that Mauritius cancelled the Lease for reasons connected to its policy
against land speculation. The Respondent explains that under Mauritian law an industrial
lease is a private contract and the private nature of such contract has been confirmed by the
Mauritian Supreme Court. The Respondent adds that the Supreme Court reached the same
conclusion precisely in a case concerning a Government’s decision to cancel a lease for
failure to start construction. Furthermore, the contract was not offered in a public

auction.”*!

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that whether or not a private party is selected by
the Government through a public auction is not a defining feature of a public contract. On
the other hand, the State may administer its real estate as any private entity and not
necessarily invoke its public authority, as it has been recognized by the Supreme Court.
The development of land and avoidance of speculation may explain the objectives that
inform the policy of the Government without turning legitimate contractual considerations

into an exercise of its prerogative as a sovereign.

The Parties have discussed arbitral case law in which contracts have been cancelled by the
Government. In their Reply, the Claimants questioned the reliance of Mauritius on
Siemens, Suez, Malicorp or RFCC because these cases concern “concession contracts or
similar arrangements intended to allow a foreign investor to extract natural resources or

provide a public service in exchange, not leases to state land granted for the purposes of

291 Resp. Rej., para. 347, fn. 610.

88

fostering development. In any event, each of these decisions confirms that the tribunal must

. . oy pe 99292
consider each case on its own facts.”?°

276. The Tribunal agrees that each case should be considered on its own facts, but the cases
discussed by the Parties are relevant because they show the circumstances in which
tribunals have determined that a State had exercised its public authority. In addition to the
cases mentioned above, the Respondent has also referred to the Almds case which
concerned State-owned real estate. The tribunal held: “[t]he management of real property,
including the exercise of the contractual right to terminate the lease, derives from the
general law; it is a capacity of any entity that holds and rents out land.” Tribunals in a

long string of cases have held similarly.?**

277. The Claimants have also argued that the Respondent abused its rights by cancelling the
Lease in order to leverage its position in the negotiation of the land exchange for the Le
Morne land. The Respondent has indicated that Revised PPG2 had not yet been adopted
when it took the decision to cancel the Lease in May 2007. The Tribunal observes that the
decision had been made but the Claimants had not been informed by the time Revised
PPG2 was published in July 2007. Irrespective of that, the record shows that there were
lengthy negotiations on a possible land exchange and Mr. Gosling himself had expressed
willingness to receive rights to land as part of such exchange.?”° To conclude, the lessee,

PJD, had breached the Lease and the Government had the right to cancel the Lease de plein

droit as permitted by the terms of the Lease and, therefore, without exercising any other

rights than its contractual rights.

d. Jurisdictional Objections Joined to the Merits

The Tribunal has joined to the merits the objection to its jurisdiction related to the lack of
substance of the alleged right to develop the leasehold. As framed above by the Tribunal,
the issue is whether, “if it had not been for the measures allegedly taken by the Respondent
in breach of the BIT, the returns would have been materialized. The answer to this question
depends on a finding by the Tribunal that the Respondent breached the BIT [...]”?°° The
Tribunal has found that the Respondent did not breach the BIT and, therefore, does not

need to consider this objection further.

Similarly, the Tribunal has joined to the merits consideration of the objection that the
contractual rights of the Claimants were not opposable to the Respondent. As stated

earlier,?””

this objection is only relevant if the Tribunal finds that the Lease was unlawfully
cancelled by the Respondent. The Tribunal has found that the cancellation of the Lease was

not unlawful and, therefore, there is no need for the Tribunal to consider this matter further.

The Tribunal has rejected as a jurisdictional objection the objection based on the
Claimants’ failure to show that their direct or indirect shareholding in PPH had diminished
in value. The Tribunal has determined that this was a matter to be dealt with as part of the

quantum, if the Tribunal reached that stage.”°* The Tribunal has not reached that stage.

The Tribunal also joined to the merits the objection based on lack of a protected investment.
According to the Tribunal, the issue was whether the expenses incurred in Pointe Jéréme
were part of a bigger whole that may have been realized were it not for actions of the
Respondent that, according to the Claimants, constituted a breach of the BIT.? No such

actions have been found by the Tribunal.

THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS

Each Party has pleaded that the Tribunal order the other to pay all the costs of the arbitration

and its legal costs.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as

the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the

parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how

and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members

of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the

Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.
This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including
attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties, as it deems appropriate. The Tribunal
has rejected the majority of the objections advanced by the Respondent as regards its
jurisdiction as well as the Respondent’s claims of inadmissibility, finding that it has
jurisdiction vis-a-vis all of the Claimants except TGI. On the other hand, the Tribunal has
rejected the Claimants’ claims on the merits. In these circumstances the Tribunal considers
it appropriate that each Party pay for its own costs related to the arbitration and for 50% of
the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and of ICSID’s administrative fees and direct

expenses.

The fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses,

amount to (in USD):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Dr. Rigo Sureda $116,706.30
Prof. Alexandrov $101,589.50

ICSID’s administrative fees $158,000.00
Direct expenses (estimated) $76,342.72
Total $577,611.78

92

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.

As a result, each Party’s share of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses amounts to USD 288,805.89.

expenses of the ICSID Secretariat.

The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

DISSENTING OPINION
OF ARBITRATOR ALEXANDROV

1. With respect, and with regret, I part company with my colleagues regarding the
Award’s analysis and conclusions on liability, both with respect to Le Morne Brabant and Pointe
Jéréme.

A. Le Morne Brabant

2. The salient facts are as follows. A local company, LMB, was incorporated to
implement the Le Morne Brabant project. It acquired the land for the project. Claimants could
not acquire shares in LMB before they received an authorization to own the land. Instead,
Claimants entered into two contracts with their local partner SMB: the 2006 Shareholders
Agreement and the 2006 Intermediary Agreement. The 2006 contracts covered both possible
scenarios: (i) if Claimants received authorization to own the land, they would acquire shares in
LMB from SMB; (ii) if such an authorization was not granted, the local partner SMB would
remain the shareholder in LMB but Claimants would implement the project and receive the
income stream from it, even without land or share ownership. Thus, regardless of whether the
land ownership authorization was granted or denied, Claimants had valuable contractual rights in
relation to the project. They contracted to develop the project in exchange for a defined income
stream. That income stream never materialized, however, as a result of the acts of Respondent.

3. In early 2004, Mr. Saliba, a consultant engaged by Respondent, prepared a report,
referred to as the Saliba report (R-041), recommending boundaries for the Le Morne site. Mr.
Saliba divided the site into a core and a buffer zone. He advised the Government to demolish
houses on the higher northern slopes and recommended that regulations preventing alterations or
extensions to existing tourist facilities or private houses be enforced. On January 30, 2004, the
Government took note of the recommendations and published the Saliba report (R-042).

4. On May 28, 2004, the Le Morne Heritage Trust Fund Act was enacted (R-045). It
adopted the core and buffer zone boundaries proposed in the Saliba report and established the Le
Morne Heritage Trust Fund (“LMHTF”). On June 23, 2004, SMB applied to Respondent’s
Board of Investment (“BOT”) for an Investment Certificate (C-016). On September 21, 2004, the
BOI sought the views of the Ministry of Arts and Culture (R-050). One day later, the Ministry of
Arts and Culture advised the BOI that it should be guided by the recommendations of the Saliba
report, “especially regarding the delimitation of the core and buffer zones of the Le Morne
Heritage site [...]” (R-051). At that point, therefore, Respondent had embraced the
recommendations of the Saliba report, including in relation to the establishment of the core and
the buffer zone.

5. On March 15, 2005, LMHTF recommended that the Ministry of Arts and Culture
request assistance of an expert from UNESCO’s World Heritage Center to advise, among other
matters, specifically on the project submitted by SMB (C-152). Thus, it was clear that the expert
would make specific recommendations with respect to Claimants’ project. The expert selected to
provide assistance to Mauritius was Dr. Abungu.

6. On August 1, 2005, Dr. Abungu prepared his first report (C-025), in which he
stated that limited development in the buffer zone should be allowed, the Government should
consider taking back the land in the core zone that was leased to private parties, and that there

must be “a clear policy on compensation, including acquisition of property that the owners may
not be allowed to develop.” Dr. Abungu’s recommendations were significant for Claimants.
First, he allowed for some limited development in the buffer zone. Second, he recognized the
existence of rights that could not be extinguished without proper compensation. With respect to
the project planned by Claimants, Dr. Abungu noted specifically that Claimants’ intention was
“to develop a win-win situation” and that they were prepared to be flexible as to what needed to
be done and where.

7. On September 7, 2005, Dr. Abungu submitted further preliminary
recommendations in his second report (C-027). Dr. Abungu recommended that the Claimants’
development be allowed, subject to adjustments to the location and number of villas (no more
than 45). He considered that a golf course and small clubhouse could be built, but that a hotel
may not be appropriate. Again, while he recommended certain adjustments and restrictions, Dr.
Abungu blessed the development of Claimants’ project. Dr. Abungu emphasized that the
recommendations were submitted “after thorough consultation” with UNESCO and after visiting
the site with “government representatives and developers so as to agree on a way forward.”

8. On October 12, 2005, after further consultations with the Government, including a
meeting with the Minister of Arts and Culture, Dr. Abungu submitted his final recommendations
in his third report (C-029). He recommended that the number of villas be limited to 65 and that
the construction of a moderate-sized hotel with a maximum of 35 rooms be permitted. He also
viewed favorably Claimants’ proposal to replace the golf course with an indigenous forest and
noted that “[t]his would be an extremely positive move as it would not only enhance the
environment around but would greatly add value to the site of Le Morne by ensuring it remain as
close as possible to what it should be.”

9. In sum, Dr. Abungu prepared two preliminary reports and one final report with
recommendations. Those recommendations were made after extensive discussions with the
Government and consultations with UNESCO. The recommendations allowed for the
development of Claimants’ project, albeit with some restrictions. Clearly, the process and the
results of Dr. Abungu’s efforts created expectations that the development of the project, within
the parameters he recommended, was consistent with the Government’s objective of inscribing
Le Morne as a World Heritage Site.

10. On December 19, 2005, Mr. Giraux, Claimants’ local partner, wrote to the BOI on
behalf of SMB (R-066). He explained that at a meeting on October 15, 2005, the Minister of
Arts and Culture had proposed to Claimants to modify the project in compliance with Dr.
Abungu’s recommendations, in particular, to build 65 villas, a hotel with 35 rooms, a restaurant,
a golf course and a golf country club. Mr. Giraux further explained that, while initially
Claimants had been reluctant to accept the Minister’s proposal, they had decided to “espouse the
philosophy of the Government and more particularly that of the Ministry of Arts and Culture,”
and to accept the proposal made to Claimants during “the second session of the fast track
committee.” Mr. Giraux further stated that, in light of Claimants’ acceptance of the
Government’s proposal, there was no reason not to proceed to the issuance of a Letter of Intent
(‘LOT’).

11. This letter is significant for several reasons: (i) it shows that it was Respondent’s
proposal that Claimants proceed with a modified project in compliance with Dr. Abungu’s
recommendations; and (ii) after initial hesitation, Claimants accepted the Government’s proposal
and sought the issuance of a LOI on the basis of that proposal. The fact that Claimants accepted
the Government’s proposal explains why, as discussed below, the Government approved the
project, and the BOT issued the first LOI, only some 10 days after Mr. Giraux’s letter.

12. That approval and the issuance of the LOI came on December 30, 2005. Ina
letter from the Ministry of Arts and Culture to the BOI of December 30, 2005 (C-161), the
Ministry of Arts and Culture stated clearly that: (i) the Government had approved Dr. Abungu’s
recommendations regarding Claimants’ Le Morne project; (ii) the project would include 65
villas, a hotel of 35 rooms, a small restaurant, a golf course and a small club house; (iii) those
recommendations should be “strictly adhered to” for the purpose of developing the project; (iv)
the boundaries of the core and the buffer zone had also been approved as per Dr. Abungu’s
recommendations; and (v) the BOI could now proceed to issue the LOI. Thus, on December 30,
2005, Respondent approved Claimants’ project pursuant to the recommendations of Dr. Abungu,
stating explicitly the parameters within which Claimants would be allowed to build, and allowed
the BOI to proceed with the issuance of the LOI.

13. The BOI memo of the same date (C-160): (i) described in detail what the project
should comprise in compliance with Dr. Abungu’s recommendations, (ii) noted that on
December 19, 2005, Mr. Giraux informed the Government of Claimants’ agreement to modify
the project “to be aligned with” Dr. Abungu’s updated recommendations, and (iii) very
importantly, stated that:

The project was submitted to Cabinet on 30 December 2005. In an even-dated
letter, the Ministry of Arts and Culture informed BOI that [the] Government has
approved the recommendations of Dr Abungu, UNESCO Expert, to comprise the
construction of 65 villas, a hotel of 35 rooms, a small restaurant, and [a] golf
course of 18-holes with a small club house. Moreover, the Ministry informed BOI
that the latter can proceed with the issue of a Letter of Intent to the project.

14. Thus, the BOI memo seeking the Managing Director’s approval of the issuance of
the LOI explicitly stated that it was based on the Government’s approval of the project. The LOI
was issued on the same date. The Award states (para. 230) that the LOI “did not confer any
development rights to the Claimants.” But the LOI was a necessary step in the process of
developing the project. Moreover, the Government’s approval of the project, within the
parameters recommended by Dr. Abungu, and the issuance of the LOI on the basis of that
Government approval, created legitimate expectations that Claimants would be allowed to pursue
the development of the project.

15. In sum, in the fall of 2005, the Government proposed to Claimants a scaled-down
project in compliance with Dr. Abungu’s recommendations; Claimants eventually agreed to scale
down their project accordingly; the Government approved the project within the agreed
parameters; and the BOT issued the LOI on that basis. It was the Government’s proposal—the
Government’s wish—that the Claimants proceed with a modified and scaled-down project, and

after Claimants’ acceptance of the Government’s proposal, the Government approved the
project. The evidence at the hearing showed that the project (as well as the Pointe Jéréme
project) was considered a top priority project approved by a fast-track committee chaired by the
Prime Minister and comprised of the relevant ministers.

16. Thus, Claimants proceeded on the basis of the Government’s approval and the
LOI. Among other things, they prepared and submitted a Detailed Master Plan (C-137), worked
with banks and investors to obtain financing, and submitted a detailed Environmental Impact
Assessment, which was discussed with relevant Government agencies and their consultants,
including during a site visit by the Ministry of the Environment (First Gosling WS, paras. 49-50).
Those facts have not been disputed. The only dispute between the parties was whether
Claimants submitted the documents requested by the BOT in its letter of June 2, 2006 (corporate
documents, updated feasibility study and master plan, layout plans and architectural drawings,
financial structure, work plan, and implementation schedule) (C-050). Mr. Gosling testified at
the hearing that the documents were submitted (Tr. Day 2, 388:1-389:19), which is supported by
the fact that there were no further letters by the BOI asking for those documents.

17. In the meantime, Respondent’s actions continued to be consistent with Dr.
Abungu’s recommendations and the Government’s December 30, 2005 approval of the project.
As noted above, on June 2, 2006, the BOI sent a letter to SMB asking for the submission of the
plans, feasibility studies, and other documents set out in the LOI “to enable BOI to process the
Investment Certificate” (C-047). According to the Award (para. 233), this letter did not provide
any assurances that an Investment Certificate would be issued. This is correct but it is beside the
point. The letter was consistent with the policy of the Government to allow the development of
the project within the recommendations of Dr. Abungu and as approved by the Government in
December 2005. The BOI would not be asking about feasibility studies and development plans
if the intention of the Government was to prohibit the implementation of Claimants’ project (or
any development at Le Morne).

18. Further, on February 7, 2007, the BOI sent Claimants a copy of the Draft Land
Management Plan for the Le Morne Cultural Landscape prepared by the Ministry of Arts and
Culture (C-063), which allowed for the development of the project. Critically, in June 2007, the
Ministry of Housing and Lands issued a Planning Policy Guidance for the Le Morne Cultural
Landscape, effective from June 25, 2007, and approved by the Cabinet — the so-called PPG2
(CL-010). PPG2 was consistent with the Draft Management Plan and again allowed
development at Le Morne, including, specifically, the development of “hotels, villas with a more
residential architecture” and “quality/luxury hillside retreats and eco-tourism lodges.”

19. This was the official Government policy and the Government’s position as of
June 2007. Claimants relied on this official Government policy, and on the representations
specifically made to them by the Government (ranging from the approval of their project by the
Government in the fall of 2005 to the issuance of PPG2 in June 2007) to continue investing in
the project.

20. Between June and September 2007, however, Respondent changed its mind, to
the detriment of Claimants. In September 2007, the Ministry of Housing and Lands, with the

approval of the Cabinet, issued a revised Planning Policy Guidance, the Revised PPG2 (CL-011),
prohibiting any development on Claimants’ land situated within the buffer zone. This was a
dramatic change of policy and came as a surprise to Claimants.

21. Respondent changed its mind pursuant to, among others, the advice of Dr.
Odendaal, a consultant engaged by the Government after the Le Morne dossier was rejected by
the UNESCO World Heritage Committee. Claimants had been led to believe that the limited
development recommended by Dr. Abungu and approved by the Government was consistent
with the overarching objective of inscribing Le Morne as UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Everything that happened, starting in 2004 with the Saliba report and continuing through June
2007 with the adoption of PPG2, served that overarching objective while at the same time
allowing the development of the project. During that period, the project, as amended and
adjusted, was considered by Respondent to be consistent with the inscription objective.
Claimants proceeded on that basis.

22. In September 2007, however, Claimants found out that the Government had
changed its mind; their project now (with the adoption of the revised PPG2) was considered
inconsistent with the UNESCO inscription. The Government may have been right to change its
mind; it may well have been necessary to prohibit any development at Le Morne in order to
ensure UNESCO inscription. But this is not the relevant question. The key point is that the
Government’s conduct of representing to Claimants for years that the development of their
project, within the agreed parameters, was permitted, and then suddenly prohibiting any
development, is a violation of the protections provided in the BIT.

23. The Award focuses on the fact that Claimants had not obtained all the necessary
permits and authorizations and thus did not have the rights to begin the development of the
project. Indeed, Claimants did not have all the necessary permits and certificates to take the
project forward to completion. The Award concludes, therefore, that Claimants did not have
development rights and dismisses the claims on that basis.

24. Claimants, however, were entitled to rely on the Government’s proposal for the
development of the project, which they accepted, and on the Government’s approval of the
project within the agreed parameters. The Government approved the recommendations of Dr.
Abungu and, very specifically, approved the precise parameters of what Claimants were allowed
to build. In reliance on this approval, Claimants continued investing in the project. Claimants
had contractual rights to an income stream from the project. Those contractual rights were
destroyed by the Government’s change of policy in September 2007.

25. The Award itself recognizes (para. 132) that Claimants’ rights under the 2006
contracts had value. According to the Award, the 2006 contracts “conferred contractual rights
among their respective parties and constitute the contractual structure for the investors to carry
out the Le Morne Project.” The Award continues (para. 132):

For this project to become a reality, the Claimants needed the PMO authorization
but also had contemplated in the alternative a sponsor’s contract if that
authorization was not forthcoming. Under whichever alternative, the Claimants

needed the permits listed in the 2005 LOI. In other words, they had a potential
investment, based on their contractual rights, in case they would obtain the
necessary permits to develop their investment. The extent that progress or lack of
it in the realization of the Project implicated the responsibility of the Respondent
as argued by the Claimants is a matter for the merits.

26. The Award’s logic on this point is flawed. The contractual rights in question
existed. The Award so finds in paras. 133 - 135, where it concludes that Claimants’ contractual
rights constituted “‘assets” within the BIT’s definition of investment, prior to the time of the
alleged breach. The value of the assets may have been in doubt, but that is a matter of quantum,
not a matter of liability. As a matter of liability, the question is whether Claimants were
deprived of those assets or whether their rights to those assets were interfered with in an unfair
and inequitable manner. That Claimants had not obtained all necessary permits, including an
Investment Certificate, reduced materially the value of their rights. But one can hardly argue
that the rights that constituted Claimants’ assets, i.e., Claimants’ investment, had no value
whatsoever prior to the alleged breach. By characterizing Claimants’ rights as “assets,” the
Award itself recognizes that those rights had value. That value would have been much higher
had Claimants acquired development rights; but it cannot be disputed that whatever rights,
whatever assets, Claimants possessed prior to September 2007 had some value. In an attempt to
cure the flaws in its analysis, the Award seeks to characterize Claimants’ contractual rights as a
“potential investment” (para. 132) or “potentially protected assets” (para. 135) thus contradicting
its own finding of jurisdiction ratione materiae.

27. It is undisputed that Respondent’s primary objective was the inscription of Le
Morne as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is also undisputed that, particularly in light of the
rejection of the first application, Respondent was very concerned that the objective might not be
achieved if any development, including in the buffer zone, was allowed. It is undisputed that the
inscription of Le Morne as a UNESCO World Heritage Site was in the public interest of
Mauritius and its people, and that it was a noble goal consistent with the objective of preserving
the history of the place, honoring the dignity of the slaves who lived and died there, creating a
symbol of freedom and human dignity, and — last but not least — preserving the physical beauty
of Le Morne. In sum, Respondent was fully entitled to prohibit any development at Le Morne,
including in the buffer zone, in the interests of the people of Mauritius — and it did so. In doing
so, however, Respondent deprived Claimants of their investments, namely their contractual
rights to develop the project. Respondent’s new policy adopted in September 2007 stands in
sharp contrast with Respondent’s proposal to Claimants to pursue a more limited project,
Respondent’s December 2005 approval of the project, Respondent’s PPG2 until the Revised
PPG2 was issued in September 2007, and, in sum, with all of Respondent’s actions and
representations to Claimants up until September 2007. Therefore, Respondent deprived
Claimants of the value of their rights in violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard and
expropriated Claimants’ investment. Claimants, therefore, must be compensated for the value of
those rights.

28. Put differently, the questions of how advanced the project was, whether Claimants
had acquired development rights or were yet to acquire them, whether the project was well
advanced or was still at its inception, are not relevant to liability — they are relevant to quantum.

It is at the damages phase that the question of the value of Claimants’ assets arises. For liability,
by contrast, what matters is: (i) the existence of an investment, i.e., an asset (such as contractual
rights as defined by the BIT); and (ii) the destruction of the value of that asset through unfair
treatment or dispossession (even if the dispossession may be for a public purpose). The Award
correctly acknowledges the existence of such assets by concluding that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction ratione materiae (because of the existence of an investment). The first element is
therefore established. In performing its analysis under the second element, however, the Award
mistakenly concludes that Claimants had no development rights and therefore could not have
been deprived of those rights. But this is not dispositive of the matter. Even if Claimants had
rights that were short of full and final development rights, the destruction of those rights would
still be a violation of the BIT.

B. Pointe Jéréme

29. The Pointe Jéréme lease qualifies as an investment under the BIT: it involves a
bundle of contractual rights to develop the Pointe Jéréme project. Those rights fall within the
definition of “investment” under the BIT. Being an asset, those rights had some value — how
much value is a matter of damages. What matters for the purposes of liability is whether
Respondent properly terminated the lease or not; improper interference with Claimants’ rights
would be a violation of the BIT.

30. The termination of the lease was not inconsistent with the law of Mauritius and
with the lease itself — it is undisputed that the Government had the discretion not to grant the
requested extension and to terminate the lease. On that basis, the Award concludes that
Respondent did not violate the BIT. The inquiry should not stop there, however. The question
remains how Respondent exercised the discretion it had under the lease and the law of Mauritius.
The evidence shows that Respondent exercised its discretion in a non-transparent, unfair,
arbitrary, and discriminatory manner.

31. On August 1, 2006, Claimants wrote to the Ministry of Housing and Lands to
request a one-year extension of the lease (C-052). Fourteen months later, on September 20,
2007, the application for the extension was rejected and the lease was terminated (C-088 and
C-089). The process of reaching that decision was non-transparent, unfair, and arbitrary.

32. A letter dated October 4, 2006 (R-087) by the principal surveyor to the deputy
chief surveyor, Mr. Seebun, briefly discussed the Pointe Jér6me project, noted that the investors
had already invested £1 million, and stated that a decision on the requested lease extension was
needed. The letter made no recommendations. Next, five months later, on March 8, 2007, the
Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Housing and Lands conducted a meeting with the
participation of officials from other ministries and the BOI. The minutes of the meeting (R-098)
reflect the discussion of the Pointe Jér6me project in a couple of sentences only. The discussion
appeared to be inconclusive — no recommendation was made.

33. The next document is an internal memorandum addressed from Mr. Seebun to Mr.
Conhye dated March 19, 2007 (R-099). Mr. Seebun concludes the memo by pointing out that a
decision was required as to whether to grant a last and final extension of the lease. An additional

handwritten paragraph, dated March 27, 2007, says that Mr. Seebun’s memorandum “‘is
submitted for approval, please.” The memorandum was submitted by Mr. Conhye to the
Permanent Secretary and to the Minister of Housing and Lands with a further handwritten note
expressing support for granting a final extension to the company to deal with the issues set forth
by Mr. Seebun. Thus, the fact that the previous extension had been labeled “final” was no
obstacle to the staff of the Ministry of Housing and Lands supporting a further extension.

34. Next in the record is a handwritten note by the Permanent Secretary to the
Minister of Housing and Lands dated April 4, 2007, transmitting Mr. Seebun’s memorandum (R-
103). This note says, “You may wish to discuss. Please.”

35. However, there is no evidence of any discussion. On the contrary, on May 12,
2007, the Minister of Housing and Lands, in a hand-written note of two sentences (R-103),
instructs the Permanent Secretary to “cancel lease as lessee has not fulfilled the conditions as
agreed. Please consider to reallocate the land to a bona fide developer.”

36. This is the whole of the process that led to the decision not to extend the lease,
and the two hand-written sentences by the Minister of Housing and Lands comprises the whole
of the decision. There is no discussion, justification, reasoning, or analysis whatsoever. There is
no discussion, for example, of (i) what conditions were not fulfilled; (ii) why construction had
not started; (iii) what the investors had already done in relation to the project and what they had
failed to do; (iv) whether the requested extension would allow the investors to go forward with
the project and complete construction; or (v) why Claimants were not bona fide investors, as
“decided” by the minister.

37. The last point is quite surprising because there had been no suggestion in any
correspondence, any document on the record, or any witness testimony, that Claimants were not
bona fide investors. Indeed, as noted earlier, the first of the documents discussed, the letter by
the principal surveyor to the deputy chief surveyor (Mr. Seebun) (R-87), stated that the investors
have already invested £1 million. The Minister of Housing and Lands did not seem bothered by
the fact that £1 million had been invested — in his view, that did not make Claimants bona fide
investors. He knew that Claimants were not speculative investors, however. The record shows
clearly that Claimants wanted to develop the project and Respondent was fully aware of that.

38. The Minister of Housing and Lands rejected without any explanation or
justification his staff's support for granting a final extension to the company. There is no record
of the Minister discussing that recommendation with the Permanent Secretary or anyone else.
There is no record of any discussions with Claimants, including about the fulfillment of the
conditions of the lease. The documents discussed above constitute the whole “process” of
decision-making, culminating with the Minister’s two hand-written sentences.

39. This is in stark contrast with the description of the proper process by the former
principal surveyor, Mr. Naidoo, who testified in para. 6 of his witness statement that typically
“the Ministry would investigate why the promoter had failed to start construction work and
consider whether granting an extension would serve the overriding objective of fostering
development at the site.” He elaborated on that point in his witness statement and emphasized

that the fact that construction had not started was not in itself a proper reason to deny an
extension.

40. None of what Mr. Naidoo describes in his witness statement happened in the case
of the Pointe Jér6me project. Nobody recommended to the Minister of Housing and Lands that
the lease should be terminated. Nobody investigated why construction had not started, even
though the investors had presented a plan, were in the process of obtaining permits, and had
invested significant amounts in the project. How and on what basis the Minister reached his
decision remains an enigma. The inevitable conclusion is that Respondent abused its discretion
to terminate the lease. The termination was unreasonable, unfair, arbitrary, and unjustified.

Al. It was also discriminatory. The evidence shows that other projects, where
construction had not started either, received lease extensions. Mr. Naidoo testified that
extensions were typically granted, even when the lease had expired, if it was determined that the
investor had the commitment and the resources to develop the site. Mr. Naidoo was a credible
witness who did not appear to have any interest in the outcome of the case. Further, there is no
evidence in the record, and it was not argued by Respondent, that any other lease for any other
project was cancelled by a two-sentence decision without any inquiry or investigation, without
any discussion with the developer, and without any reasoning and any justification.

42. Finally, it is significant that the Government did not approach Claimants
throughout this process, which took more than one year, with any questions or requests for
information. The process was anything but transparent. Moreover, the Minister’s decision,
made on May 12, 2007, was not communicated to Claimants until September 20, 2007 (more
than four months later). In the meantime, Claimants continued pursuing the project.

43. All this leads to the conclusion that the Government abused its discretion when it
cancelled the lease. The Award acknowledges that the Government did not behave properly. It
says (para. 271):

It is surprising that the Government would take thirteen months to make a
decision on the request for an extension and then that the decision would not be
communicated to the requester for four months even if legal advice was sought.
During this time, there were no interactions with the investors, no further
information was requested, no meetings with the authorities were convened, no
indication on the administrative progress of the request was given. There is no
record either that the Claimants bothered to inquire.

 

44. The Award, however, goes on to say that Claimants continued pursuing the
project knowing that the Government was within its rights to cancel the lease and, therefore,
knowingly took the risk of pursuing the project in the interim. But this logic is flawed, because
Claimants could not have expected that the Government would act in a non-transparent manner
and that it would cancel the lease without any discussion with Claimants, without any inquiry or
investigation, without any meaningful internal discussion, and without any analysis or
justification. Claimants may have taken the risk of pursuing the project knowing full well that
the Government was within its rights to decline the extension of the lease. However, Claimants

could not, and should not, have accounted for the risk that the Government would exercise its
rights in a non-transparent, discriminatory, arbitrary, and unfair manner.

weak

45. In sum, my view is that Respondent violated Art. 2(2) of the BIT by denying
Claimants fair and equitable treatment and Art. 5 of the BIT by expropriating Claimants’
investments (albeit for a public purpose) without paying compensation, both with respect to the
Le Morne and the Pointe Jéréme projects. The value of Claimants’ assets (i.e., their contractual
rights) may be fairly limited in light of the fact that they were yet to obtain the necessary permits
and authorizations and that none of the projects had approached construction; this is, however, a
matter of damages rather than liability.
