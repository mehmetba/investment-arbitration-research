1. INTRODUCTION

1. The proceedings relate to marginal or abandoned gas fields in
Bangladesh which the Government of the People’s Republic of
Bangladesh (the Government), the First Respondent, had
decided to develop. In the course of this development Niko
Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. (Niko), the Claimant, concluded on
23 August 1999 a Framework of Understanding with the
Bangladesh Petroleum ®& Production Company, Limited
(BAPEX), the Second Respondent.

2. Niko conducted a Marginal Field Evaluation of three fields and,
in a report of February 2000, concluded that two of them, the
Chattak and the Feni fields, were sufficiently promising to
continue with a work plan. Thereupon Niko and BAPEX, under
the direction of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral
Resources (the Ministry), negotiated a Joint Venture Agreement
(JVA), which was concluded on 16 October 2003 with the
approval the Government.

3. The development of the Feni field was successful and gas
supplies from two wells in this field started in November 2004.
BAPEX and Niko (the Joint Venture Partners) began to
negotiate with the Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation
(Petrobangla), the Third Respondent, a Gas Purchase and Sale
Agreement (GPSA). However, due to difficulties in reaching
agreement on the price for the gas, the finalisation of the GPSA
was much delayed. Eventually it was concluded on 27
December 2006 with the approval of the Government.

4. The Joint Venture Partners had delivered gas to Petrobangla
already before the conclusion of the GPSA. They continued to
do so thereafter. Petrobangla made some payments but Niko
claims that much of the delivered gas remains unpaid. In the
Request for Arbitration of 1 April 2010 Niko quantified the
outstanding amount at US$35.71 million.

5. During drilling in the Chattak field a blowout occurred on
7 January 2005 and another on 24 June 2005. The
Government formed a committee to enquire about the causes of

' REA I, paragraph 6.6.

the blowouts and the damage caused. It concluded that Niko
was responsible for the blowouts and estimated the damage
caused by them. In May or June 2008 Petrobangla and the
Government of Bangladesh commenced legal action in the Court
of District Judge, Dhaka, against Niko and others, seeking
compensation on the order of Tk746.5 crore as damages for the
two blowouts (the Compensation Claim). To the knowledge of
the Tribunal, these proceedings are still pending.

6. During the course of the negotiations for the GPSA the Claimant
delivered on 23 May 2005 a car to the State Minister for Energy
and Mineral Resources; in June 2005 Niko Resources Ltd. (Niko
Canada), the Claimant’s parent company, invited the Minister,
at its costs, to an exposition in Calgary. The delivery of the car
became public knowledge in Bangladesh; the Minister resigned
on 18 June 2005 and returned the car to BAPEX on 20 June
2005. Following an investigation in Canada, Niko Canada, on
the basis of an agreed statement of facts, was convicted on 24
June 2011 and ordered to pay Canadian Dollars 9.499 million.

7. The present proceedings were started by two successive
Requests for Arbitration, one filed with the International Centre
for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) on
1 April 2010 (the First Request or RfA I) and registered as
ARB/10/11; the other filed with ICSID on 16 June 2010 (the
Second Request or RfA II) and registered as ARB/10/18. The
Claimant specified that the first of these requests concerned the
Compensation Claim and the second the outstanding payments
under the GPSA (the Payment Claims) .?

8. The Respondents have objected to the jurisdiction of ICSID and
this Tribunal on a number of grounds which shall be described
and examined in further detail in this Decision.

9. The Tribunal held preliminary procedural consultations on 14
February 2011 in Geneva, followed on the same day by a First
Session during which the organisation of the proceedings in the
two cases was discussed. It was agreed that the two cases were
to proceed in a concurrent manner and that the two Tribunals
may render their decisions in the two cases in a single

> REA IL, paragraph 6.10.

10.

11.

12.

instrument. In the present decision the two Tribunals therefore
are referred to collectively as “the Tribunal”.

At the First Session it was also decided that, in a first phase of
the proceedings, the issue of jurisdiction would be considered
and decided. The Parties produced written submissions and
documentary evidence; witnesses were heard and oral argument
was presented in a procedure described in further detail below.

Some of the documentary evidence produced in the arbitration
is in the Bengali language. In accordance with paragraph 10.1.
of the Summary Minutes of the Joint First Session, the Party
introducing such documents in the proceedings produced an
English translation which accompanied the document. None of
these translations were challenged during the course of the
proceedings. The Tribunal therefore takes the produced English
translation as correct and relies on it.

Documents issued by authorities in Bangladesh normally are
dated according to the Bengali calendar, often with a
corresponding date according to the Gregorian calendar. In the
present Decision only the date according to the Gregorian
calendar is given.

SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS

The present dispute relates to two gas fields named Feni and
Chattak (sometimes also spelled Chhatak) in Bangladesh. These
two fields, together with the Kamta gas field, had been declared
by the Government as “Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields.”

Both Chattak and Feni are vested in Bangladesh pursuant to
Article 143 of Bangladesh’s Constitution.

The Chattak field (located in Sylhet) was discovered in 1959 by
Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (subsequently renamed Bangladesh
Petroleum Ltd) and brought into production in 1960. It
supplied local users and, from 1974, the Sylhet Pulp and Paper
Mill. It was shut down in 1985 due to increased water
production.”

The Feni field (located in Chittagong) was discovered by a
predecessor of BAPEX in 1980. It was in production between
1988 and 1998.8

Both fields were at some point sold or transferred to BAPEX.?
Only the Feni field became productive again and delivered gas,
which is the subject of the present arbitrations.

3.1 The negotiations leading to the JVA

Starting with a letter and preliminary proposal of 12 April 1997,
Niko Resources Ltd, the parent company of the Claimant,
approached the Bangladesh Minister of Energy and Mineral
Resources regarding the development of some marginal and
non-productive gas fields in Bangladesh.!° After some further
correspondence Niko Resources Ltd was invited to make a
presentation to the Ministry on 21 June 1998.

1999, Exhibit 9, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.

27.

28.

29.

This presentation was followed by a letter of 28 June 1998 in
which the proposal was further developed. In addition to
technical and commercial considerations the letter contained
the following passage:

“Niko will support and follow the procedural requirement
the Government of Bangladesh will require to privatise the
marginal, non-producing fields. However, in order to ensure
transparency, Niko proposes the following modality for
finalising the proposed joint venture contract with BAPEX
and putting the subject non-producing marginal fields on
production:

A. To our understanding since Niko is the first
international company to promote the
development of the marginal fields, the Ministry of
Energy and Mineral Resources may execute an
MOU with Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. A
copy of the MOU is attached for your
consideration.

B. Upon execution of the MOU, the terms and
conditions of the contract are negotiated between
Petrobangla and Niko and a draft contract are
prepared.

C. Petrobangla then makes a public announcement
of the project complete with the finalised terms
and conditions... [follows the description of a
competitive procedure]”!!

After some further correspondence, Niko Resources Ltd wrote to
BAPEX on 1 February 1999, referring to the past
correspondence with the Ministry and Petrobangla and stated:

“As you may be aware that the cornerstone of our proposal
is the partnership we seek with BAPEX wherein the
following key benefits will be availed by BAPEX: ...”!2

Following a meeting of representatives from the Ministry and
Petrobangla on 26 January 1999,!3 the Ministry wrote to
Petrobangla on 25 May 1999, giving instructions “in the matter
of implementation of proposal of Niko Resources on Marginal

" Exhibit 7, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.

Gas Field Development”. In the English translation produced by
the Respondents, the letter reads as follows:

“On the above referenced matter it is notified that after
examining the proposal of Niko Resources on Marginal Gas
Field_Development, Government_has_made_the_following
decisions:

 

e The gas fields Chattok [sic], Kamta and Feni may be
developed in the ‘Marginal Gas Field Development’
system as per the proposal of Niko Resource.

e A Joint Venture Agreement must be executed
between Bapex and Niko before a Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) is signed with Niko. The
Managing Director of Bapex can conduct discussions
with Niko regarding this.

¢ The ‘Swiss Challenge’ method may be adopted for
developing the said gas fields.

You are requested to take necessary next steps for
implementation of the proposal.” !+

By a letter of 12 August 1999 to Petrobangla, with copy to
BAPEX, the Ministry approved a Framework of Understanding.!5
The letter refers to the Petrobangla letter of 30 June 1999 and
identifies as subject “Regarding the Approval of the Proposal of
Niko Resources on Marginal Gas Field Development and
Production”. The text of the letter reads as follows:

“In light of the above subject and reference it is to inform
that before signing the MOU regarding Marginal Gas Field
Development between BAPEX and Niko Resources,
technical evaluation of the Non-Producing Marginal gas
fields is required to complete the joint study.

02. In this respect approval is given as directed to
complete the Framework of Understanding.”

On 23 August 1999 BAPEX and Niko executed an agreement
entitled “Framework of Understanding for the Study for
Development and Production of Hydrocarbon from the Non-
producing Marginal Gas Fields of Chattak, Feni and Kamta” (the

4 Exhibit 11, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1 (emphasis in the original).

Framework of Understanding).'© The effectiveness of this
understanding was made “subject to the approval of the
appropriate authority” .'7

Pursuant to the Framework of Understanding, BAPEX and Niko
conducted a Marginal Field Evaluation of the three fields. The
report on this evaluation, dated February 2000, concluded that
the results were sufficiently promising to continue with a work
plan for the Chattak and Feni fields; the Kamta field was found
“uneconomic to further develop at this time”.'18 The Report
concluded:

“Based on the result of the study as indicated in the
currently established reserves stated above, a joint venture
contract may be executed between BAPEX and Niko as
stipulated in the study upon approval of Petrobangla and
the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.” !9

On 29 March 2001 the Ministry requested Petrobangla “to take
the necessary steps for finalising the JVA by following the Swiss
challenge method ...”;2° The instructions were passed on by
Petrobangla to BAPEX on 11 April 2001, transmitting the letter
of 29 March 2001 “for your kind acknowledgement and
necessary steps to be taken ...”?!

In 2001 the Ministry prepared a Procedure for Development of
Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields (the Procedure). The
Procedure was submitted to the Prime Minister with a note from
the Ministry, dated 6 June 2001.22 The Procedure formed the
framework for the JVA, and when this agreement eventually was
executed, was attached to the JVA as Annex C.23

The Ministry directed the preparation of a joint venture
agreement between BAPEX and Niko. In a letter to Petrobangla,
dated 20 May 2001, the Ministry wrote:

'© Attached as Annex A to the JVA and produced as Attachment A to RfA I.

“Subject: - Policy on Development and Production of
Hydrocarbon from the Marginal and
Abandoned gas fields
A draft policy regarding the Development of Marginal
and Abandoned gas fields is sent herewith. In light of this
policy it is requested as directed to finalise and forward a
Joint Venture Agreement on Chattak, Kamta and Feni
between BAPEX and Niko Resources for the approval of
ministry.”24

The Ministry gave directions on 10 June 2001 to Petrobangla
and BAPEX with respect to the negotiations of the JVA.
Referring to the Development Procedure, which at the time was
“awaiting the final approval of the Honourable Prime Minister”,
it gave directions in the following terms:

“2. In this situation in light of the draft procedure for
development of Chatak, Kamta and Feni marginal and
abandoned gas fields for urgent finalisation of the Joint
Venture Agreement between Bapex and Niko Resource:

(1) Write a letter to Niko Resource mentioning specific date
for coming to Bangladesh and

(2) After finalisation of the negotiation of Joint Venture
Agreement between Bapex and Niko Resource, send the
JVA to this ministry for approval of the government by
20/06/2001.”25

Petrobangla passed on these directions to BAPEX on the
following day, stating:

“... For urgent finalisation of the JVA between BAPEX and
Niko Ltd in the light of the procedure mentioned in the draft
procedure, it has been stated to (i) send invitation letter to
Niko mentioning specific date and (2) upon completion of
negotiation between BAPEX and Niko, the JVA to be sent to
Ministry for approval of Government by 20.06.2001. You
are requested to take urgent steps in this regard.”

By that time, a difference had arisen concerning the coordinates
of the Chattak gas field. The difference was discussed at a
meeting between BAPEX and Niko intended for finalising the
JVA. The difference was not resolved at that meeting, but the

Respondent as Exhibit 1, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.

Parties agreed that “other than the issues under discussion
herein all other issues, terms and conditions in the Negotiated
Draft JVA June 2000 have been agreed to between BAPEX and
Niko subject to final approval from BAPEX management’ .?7

An opinion of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary
Affairs was sought. Once this opinion had been obtained, the
Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources wrote to
Petrobangla and BAPEX, indicating the precise coordinates of
the Chattak gas field and gave the following directions:

“(b) In order to finalise the draft Joint Venture Agreement,
Petrobangla should adhere to all the conditions mentioned
in the Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned
Gas Fields approved by the Ex-Prime Minister on 14-06-
2001 and other relevant rules-regulations, and requested to
send the draft Joint Venture Agreement to this division.”?8

The JVA continued to be discussed at the Ministry of Power,
Energy and Mineral Resources. After a meeting at the Ministry
on 16 September 2002, Petrobangla received a letter from the
Ministry dated 25 September 2002 which it passed on to BAPEX
and requested it “to send the proposed JVA arising from the
Minutes of the Meeting held at the Ministry held on 16.0.2002.”29
The Respondents have produced a series of other letters from
the Ministry and from Petrobangla which show that Petrobangla
turned to the Ministry for directions which it then passed on to
BAPEX.3°

On 18 March 2003 a proposal seems to have been submitted to
the Prime Minister concerning the JVA. Referring to the
approval of this proposal by the Prime Minister, the Minister
wrote to Petrobangla on 11 October 2003 with copy to BAPEX
stating the following:

“2. It may be mentioned that the approved direction of
the Hon’ble Prime Minister is as follows:

A) In the light of the opinion of Ministry of Law, Justice
and Parliamentary Affairs, Chhatak Gas Field shall

be considered as per Exhibit-A of Frame Work of
Understanding.

And

Petrobangla shall be directed for finalisation of the draft of
Joint Venture Agreement following the entire conditions as
described in Procedure _ for Development of
Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields approved by the former
Hon’ble Prime Minister on 14-06-2001 for singing a joint
venture agreement between BAPEX and NIKO and as per
other related terms and conditions.”3!

Two days later, on 13 October 2003 BAPEX wrote to Niko,
inviting it to sign the JVA in the following terms:

“In accordance with the approval accorded by the
Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to sign
the “JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT FOR’ THE
DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM FROM
THE MARGINAL/ABANDONED CHATTAK & FENI GAS
FIELDS” between Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration &
Production Company Ltd (BAPEX) and Niko Resources
(Bangladesh) Ltd, you are requested to send your
Authorised representative with due authorisation to sign
the said contract on 16 October, 2003 at 12.00 Noon to
the Registered office of BAPEX, Dhaka, Bangladesh.” 5?

The JVA was then executed on 16 October 2003.

3.2 The JVA and its arbitration clause

The JVA’s “Whereas” clauses present important elements
relating to the context in which it was concluded and the
function in which BAPEX acted when it entered into this
agreement. Some of these clauses are particularly relevant for
the jurisdictional issues which the Tribunal has to address.
They deserve to be quoted in extenso, emphasis being added:

“WHEREAS

Bangladesh are vested in the Republic of
Bangladesh, and

The Government has, under the Bangladesh
Petroleum Act 1974 (Act No LXIX of 1974) (as
amended up to date) the exclusive right and
authority to explore, develop, exploit, produce,
process, refine and market Petroleum Resources
within the territory, continental shelf and economic
zone of Bangladesh and it has also the exclusive
right to enter into Petroleum Agreements with
any persons for the purpose of any Petroleum
Operations, and

Petrobangla has the power to exercise rights
and powers of the Government to explore,

petroleum in the territory, continental shelf and
economic zone of Bangladesh and also to enter into
Petroleum Agreements with any person/company for
the purpose of any Petroleum Operation, and

OPERATOR |i.e. the Claimant] made a request in
1998 to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources, Govt. of the Peoples Republic of
Bangladesh to develop Marginal & Non Producing
Gas Fields of Bangladesh.

[]

BAPEX is vested with all rights free from all
encumbrances and liabilities whatsoever to assign,
develop, produce, process, refine and distribute
100% (One hundred percent) of all Petroleum
resources from or with within the territory of the
Marginal/Abandoned gas fields of Chattak & Feni
[]

BAPEX warrants that it has acquired from
Petrobangla and the Government the requisite
approvals to execute this JVA. The responsibilities
and obligations of Petrobangla and_ the
Government in all relevant Articles, Annexes and
Amendments under this JVA has been assign [sic]
to Bapex.”

45. The arbitration clause in the JVA reads as follows:

21

“Article 18. Disputes and arbitration

18.1 The Parties shall make their best efforts to settle
amicably through consultation any dispute arising in
connection with the performance or interpretation of any
provision of this JVA or over an impasse in any decision of
the JMC.

18.2 If any dispute mentioned in Article 18.1 has not been
settled through such consultation within ninety (90) days
after the dispute arises, either Party may, by notice to the
other Party, propose that the dispute be referred either for
determination by a sole expert or to arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of this Article.

18.3 Following the giving of notice under Article 18.2 the
Parties may, by mutual agreement, refer the dispute for
determination by a sole expert to be appointed by
agreement between the Parties.

18.4 As an alternative to the procedure described in Article
18.3 and if agreed upon by the Parties, such dispute shall
be referred to arbitration by an agreed Sole Arbitrator.

18.5 If the Parties fail to refer such dispute to a sole expert
under Article 18.3 or to a Sole Arbitrator under Article 18.4,
within sixty (60) days from giving of notice under Article
18.2, such dispute shall be referred to the International
Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) and
the Parties hereby consent to arbitration under the Treaty
establishing ICSID. If for any reason, ICSID fails or refuses
to take jurisdiction over such dispute, the dispute shall be
finally settled by International Chamber of Commerce.

18.6 Arbitration pursuant to Article 18.4 shall be by an
arbitration tribunal consisting of three (3) arbitrators. Each
Party shall appoint an arbitrator and the two (2) arbitrators
so appointed shall designate a third arbitrator. If one of the
Parties does not appoint its arbitrator within sixty (60) days
after the first appointment or if two (2) arbitrators, once
appointed, fail to appoint the third arbitrator, the relevant
appointment shall be made in accordance with the rules of
ICSID.

18.7 The arbitrators shall be citizens of countries that have
formal diplomatic relations with both Bangladesh and
Canada and any home country of the entities comprising
OPERATOR, and shall not have any economic interest in or
economic relationship with the Parties.

22

46.

47.

18.8 The Sole Arbitrator or the arbitration tribunal shall
conduct the arbitration in accordance with the arbitration
rules of ICSID. However, if the above mentioned arbitration
rules are in conflict with the provisions of this Article 18,
including the provisions concerning appointment of
arbitrators, the provisions of this Article 18 shall prevail.

18.9 The English language shall be the language used in
the arbitral proceedings. All hearing materials, statements
of claim or defense, award and the reasons supporting
them shall be in English.

18.10 The place of arbitration shall be Dhaka or elsewhere
as mutually agreed by the Parties.

18.11 Any arbitration award given pursuant to this Article
18 shall be final and binding upon the Parties and shall be
enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction on the
same basis as obligations between private Parties, and
any reference in this JVA to such an award shall include
any determination by a sole expert.

18.12 The right to arbitrate disputes under this agreement
shall survive the termination of this agreement.”

There has been no evidence about the origin of this clause, nor
have there been any drafts of the agreement produced in the
arbitration. However, the origin of the arbitration clause in the
GSPA, which is practically identical to that in the JVA, was
subject to extensive discussion at the hearing, leading the
Tribunal to find that it had its origin in a draft prepared by
Petrobangla.3

In the absence of any argument or evidence to the contrary, the
Tribunal concludes that the arbitration clause in the JVA also
originated from Petrobangla. Given the chain of control recorded
in the Preamble to the JVA and evidenced in the account of the
negotiations, it also must be concluded that, together with other
instructions from Petrobangla the wording of the arbitration
clause was passed on from Petrobangla to BAPEX and thus
formed the basis for the JVA negotiations with Niko.

3.3 The negotiations of the Gas Purchase and Sale
Agreement (GPSA)

Upon conclusion of the JVA, Niko commenced work on the
development of the two fields. The first well in the Feni field
which it sought to develop was Feni-3. It tested water instead of
gas in 17 of a total of 19 zones.°4 However, towards the end of
the first semester 2004 gas production was considered
imminent.

Niko wrote to Petrobangla on 19 May 2004, with copy to the
Ministry, having as reference “Gas Purchase and Sales
Agreement (GPSA) for the Feni Gas Field”. The letter explained
that a skid-mounted gas plant was to arrive on 1 June and the
Feni-3 would be put on production in July 2004. The letter
continued:

“We, therefore, would like to initiate discussions with the
Government of Bangladesh and Petrobangla to finalise the
subject agreement so that Feni-3 can be on production as
soon as the gas plant is commissioned.

We understand that pursuant to Article 7 of the “Procedure
for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields” as
approved by the Honorable Prime Minister, the gas price of
the Investor shall be negotiated between the Government,
Petrobangla, and the Investor. Moreover, Article 24.3 of the
Bapex-Niko JV stipulates that the Buyer of the gas from the
Feni Gas Field shall be Petrobangla or its designee.

In view of the above, we request a meeting with the
authorised representatives of the GOB, Petrobangla, and
Bapex to initiate the process to execute the subject
agreement so that Feni-3 well could be on production at the
earliest.” 35

On 6 June 2004, Petrobangla requested Niko to submit a
proposed GPSA for the Feni Gas Field.3° Niko responded on 14
June 2004, announcing that Feni-3 was completed, that work
on Feni-4 was advancing and that the gas plant was expected to
be in place and commissioned in time for producing gas from

these two wells by early August 2004. The letter was
accompanied by a draft for the GPSA.37

Further to a letter from the Ministry dated 15 July 2004,38 a
committee was formed “to negotiate for finalisation of gas pricing
of Ex. Feni gas field which is being developed by BAPEX-NIKO”.
The Committee, described here as the Gas Pricing Committee,
was composed of a representative of the Ministry in the function
of Convenor’? and representatives from Petrobangla, BAPEX
and Niko.4°

The first two meetings of the Committee took place on 24 July
and 4 August 2004 under the chairmanship of the Convenor.
The minutes of the two meetings are drawn up on the letterhead
of the Ministry.*! They record that Niko requested a price of
US$2.75/MCF. At the end of the discussion “the Chair offered
Niko to agree Feni Gas Price at US$1.75/MCF, since Niko signed
the JVA considering this price’. Niko stated that it would
respond later.42

Niko answered the proposal by a letter to the Additional
Secretary in the Ministry on 7 August 2004, insisting that the
gas price which it demanded was reasonable and justified. It
suggested consultations on the economics of the Feni
development.

Gas delivery started on 2 November 2004, without agreement
having been reached on the price and without a contract having
been executed.

On 7 January 2005, the first blowout occurred, followed by
another on 24 June 2005, as will be discussed in further detail
below in Section 3.6.

On 14 February 2005 Niko wrote to Petrobangla that the “trial
production period has ended. Our gas plants have been
commissioned. We now find ourselves in an extremely difficult

position with our management and board to justify and continue
gas production from Feni without finalisation of the price of our
share of the gas.” It required an immediate interim payment for
the gas delivered from November 2004 to January 2005 at the
rate of US$2.35/MCF and finalisation of the gas price within the
next ten days, failing which it would suspend gas production
from the Feni field.4°

57. Petrobangla responded the same day, announcing that it “would
make a lump sum interim payment against the gas supplied from
November, 2004 to January, 2005” without prejudice to the rate
to be agreed.*4 On 10 March 2005 Petrobangla announced that
it had “arranged a payment of US$2 million today for the time
being to you on a lump sum basis ...”*5 Niko confirmed its receipt
as “lump sum partial payment for Niko’s share of gas production
for November, December and January” .*®

58. Ina letter of 10 March 2005, BAPEX referred to the letter which
Niko had addressed to the Ministry on 9 March 2005 of which it
had received copy. BAPEX relied on Article 16.1(c) of the JVA
which identified as an event of default if “[aJny of the party
indulges/commits any act which is contrary to the interests of
Bangladesh” and required Niko to withdraw the notice of
suspension of gas production “or else we would be constrained
to take all necessary steps under the JVA to up hold the interests
of the country” .*7

59. Further meetings by the Gas Pricing Committee were held. After
a meeting on 16 March 2005 Niko wrote to the Ministry, to the
attention of the Minister himself, summarising its
understanding of the differences. The letter contained the
following passage:

“It was expressed by the Chairman of Petrobangla that the
final result of the Committee’s deliberations may be that
we will not reach a consensus on the price. He further
opined that it is possible that the Committee will have to
conclude its deliberations with a report to the Ministry that
a price for the gas could not be agreed. Niko acknowledged

that this could be a possible outcome of the Committee
meetings, however it was requested by Niko that this
conclusion be arrived at as soon as possible so that other
avenues for concluding the price agreement could be
pursued. Mr Osman [the Chairman of Petrobanglaj
suggested that if the Committee did not agree on a price
that Niko/Bapex may have to directly approach the
Government of Bangladesh for a final decision.”48

During these negotiations Niko ordered the car which then was
delivered on 23 May 2005 to the State Minister for Energy and
Mineral Resources and, in June 2005, Niko Canada invited the
Minister, at its costs, to an exposition in Calgary, followed by
the Minister’s resignation on 18 June and the return of the car
to BAPEX on 20 June 2005. These events will be considered in
further detail in Section 9.2.

The Gas Pricing Committee continued its work and held its final
meeting on 23 October 2005.49 It issued a report entitled
“Committee Report on Feni Gas Pricing”; the report is not dated
but the signatures of the members show the dates of 25 and 26
October 2005. At the beginning of this report the members of
the Committee were identified in two columns, on the left the
“Officials from Government” and on the right “Officials from
Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd”. The Officials from the
Government were the Additional Secretary of the Ministry in the
position of the Convener, the Chairman and a Director of
Petrobangla and the Managing Director of BAPEX. In the report
these members were referred to collectively as “members
representing GOB”, as “GOB Team” or using similar expressions
referring to them collectively. The report concluded as follows:

“Committee’s recommendation:

The Committee could not reach a consensus in respect of
pricing of gas to produce from Feni field. The matter,
therefore, remained unresolved.

The members representing Government side recommend
that the Niko’s share of gas from Feni filed under the terms
of JVA may be purchased by Petrobangla at best at a price
of US$1.75/MCF.”5°

Niko made comments to the Convener which it requested to “be
included as part of the Minutes” of the 23 October 2005 meeting,
presumably the Committee report just quoted. These comments
were to the effect that “if the Committee could not reach a
consensus on the matter of gas pricing that the next stage should
be to pursue an arbitrated settlement of the matter’. It
announced that it “will therefore suggest to the GOB this solution
to move forward on the matter”.5!

In a letter to the Ministry dated 25 October 2005, Niko referred
to Article 18.3 of the JVA and proposed that the gas price
determination “be referred to a sole expert to arbitrate ...”52

This proposal was not accepted and the matter remained
unresolved.

By 24 November 2005 no agreement had been reached on the
gas price and the GSPA, but Petrobangla had made interim
payments to Niko in a total amount of US$4 million.53 Niko
wrote to Petrobangla that as of 28 November 2005 it would
suspend gas production from the Feni Field pending “mutual
resolution” of the gas price, the agreement and execution of a
GPSA and “settlement of arrears for gas sold to date from the
Feni Field.”5+ Petrobangla responded on the same day,
requesting Niko to withdraw the notice and not to suspend
deliveries. It concluded: “If you are still determined to do so that
will be seriously prejudicial to our national interest and we shall
be constrained to act accordingly.”>5>

Following a letter from Niko dated 26 November 2005,
postponing the start of suspension to 29 November 2005,
Petrobangla wrote that it was restrained from making further
payments by an order of 16 November 2005 of the High Court
Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh of which it quoted
the following passage:

“Since the order retraining the respondents 1.9 from
making any payment to respondent No. 10 in respect of

any gas field or any other account passed by the High
Court Division has not been modified by the Appellate
Division that order shall continue.” 5°

Nevertheless Petrobangla insisted that deliveries should not be
suspended. It stated that it expected the GPSA could be
“completed within a month or two” .57

On 29 November 2005 a meeting between Niko representatives
and Mr Mahmudur Rahman, Energy Advisor of the Ministry,
took place at the Ministry. Niko wrote to him on the same day,
thanking him for the meeting and requesting “full support of
your Ministry and the Government of Bangladesh to assist us in
having the ad-interim order of the Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005
stayed as they apply to stopping the government from making
payments to NRBL”.5&

On the same day, 29 November 2005, Petrobangla wrote to
Niko:

“Please be informed that the purchase price of gas of the
Feni Gas Field is fixed at US$1.75/MCF.

We hereby invite you to negotiate the terms of the GPSA for
the production of Feni Gas Field, finalise, agree and
execute the same based on the above price.”59

Niko responded on 30 November 2005, stating its disagreement
with that price and reiterated its proposal to settle the difference
by reference to a sole expert. On an interim basis, it accepted
payment on the basis of US$1.75/MCF. It requested a meeting
“wherein discussions can proceed on the GPSA and agreement on
appointment of the sole expert can be reached” .©°

On 5 December 2005 Niko confirmed that it accepted payment
of US$1.75/MCF on an interim basis until determination by the
proposed expert. It sent the draft for an interim GPSA to

BAPEX. Further drafts were sent by Niko to BAPEX on 14 and
20 December 2005.°!

On 16 January 2006 Niko announced to BAPEX the temporary
reduction and shut down of production from the Feni field. It
also seems to have made such announcements to Bakhrabad
Gas Systems Ltd (BGSL). BAPEX objected to this
communication in a letter of 19 January 2006, stating inter alia:

“In our opinion this sort of unilateral decision and message
to BGSL is a violation of JVA article no 24.3 since
Petrobangla is the only authority & agent of GOB [i.e. the
Government of Bangladesh] that purchases, sells, monitors
and controls the transmission and distribution systems of
gas in the country. ...”©8

On 18 January 2006 a meeting apparently took place between
the “Advisor, Energy & Mineral Division” of the Ministry and
Niko, followed on 19 January 2006 by a meeting between Niko
and Petrobangla. As a follow-up to these meetings, Niko sent on
22 January 2006 to Petrobangla and BAPEX what it described
as the “final version” of the Interim GPSA, already initialled by
Niko.6

This version was not executed. Instead, a meeting between Niko
representatives and the Advisor, Energy & Mineral Resources
Division, at the Ministry took place on 12 February 2006. The
meeting was followed by a letter from Niko to the Advisor dated
13 February 2006 in which it stated that the Advisor’s
“confirmation of the delay in getting final approval from the Prime
Minister’s Office to allow us to proceed with our work was
concerning ...”.®5

At a meeting on 14 February 2006 Petrobangla requested Niko
to increase production from the Feni field;®° the request was
confirmed on 20 February 2006. On 26 February 2006, Niko
announced to Petrobangla, with copy to the Prime Minister, the
Ministry and others, that as from 27 February 2006 it planned

to shut down all gas production from the Feni field “until further
notice” .©7

Petrobangla objected to the decision in a letter of 28 February
2006. It added:

“We are carefully scrutinising the draft GPSA you have
submitted and our response to the same shall be
communicated to you in due course. If the shut down has
any connection with finalisation of the GPSA, it appears to
be unnecessary at this point of time when negotiations
even have not started.”©*

In a letter to Petrobangla of 2 March 2006 Niko provided
explanations for the shutdown, referring in particular to the
absence of an approved Work Programme and Budget and of a
GPSA.

Petrobangla replied on 5 March 2006 requesting that gas
production resume. The letter contained the following passage:

“(c) As you have rightly mentioned earlier the gas price
under the JVA is a matter of common understanding of the
Government of Bangladesh (GOB), Petrobangla and the
investor. Failure to reach any unanimous price decision,
cannot be arbitrated/determined by any sole expert under
the GPSA of any kind, since GOB is not going to be party to
that. The truth of the matter is price negotiation under the
JVA is not to be done at the time of GPSA negotiation
neither it could be agreed that the GPSA negotiation has
been started at the time Price Committee was made
because that had been started independently. We now
have a draft GPSA submitted by you. We are ready and
willing to start negotiation on that. Feel free to contact
us.”©9

Mr Brian Adolf, at that time Country Manager for Niko,7°
explained at the hearing that the draft to which reference is
made in this letter was the start of a new series of drafts. It
differed from that which Niko had submitted in 2004. Since Mr

Adolf commenced his activity as Country Manager for Niko only
in January 2005, he was not familiar with the 2004 draft.7!

According to Mr Adolf, when the attempt to reach an interim
GPSA had failed, Niko invited Petrobangla as follows: “why do
you not provide us what is your standard GPSA and we will work
forward from there”.7? In response Petrobangla provided a text in
Word format which Niko used as the basis for a draft by
reference to which all further negotiations were conducted. Mr
Adolf explained: “We started from scratch with the format that
Petrobangla had provided.”

Petrobangla, BAPEX and Niko met on 7 March 2006. The
following day, on 8 March 2006, Niko wrote to Petrobangla and
to Mr Jamaluddin in his function as Managing Director of
BAPEX and “Member Secretary of the Committee for
Finalisation of Gas Pricing for the JVA” that it was “in the
process of finalising the DRAFT GPSA at the earliest except the
fixing of the price”; Niko proposed determination of the price by
an expert, and added:

“Furthermore, we value the relationship we have with the
Government of Bangladesh and considering the national
interest Niko Management after having detail discussion
with the Hon’ble Advisor for the Energy & Mineral
Resources Division decided to turn on the Gas Production
from Feni Gas Filed [sic] as a gesture of our goodwill ...”74

The GPSA was approved by the Government, acting through the
Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources. On 20
December 2006 it addressed a letter to the Chairman of
Petrobangla in the following terms:

“You are informed on the above subject and reference that
the draft Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA) for the
produced gas from the Feni Gas Field as per agreement of
Bapex with NAICO [sic] sent through abovementioned
memo under reference has been approved by the
government.

2. Under the circumstances the undersigned is directed to
request you to take necessary action in the due pursuance
of the existing rules and regulations on the above
mentioned subject.”75

On the following day, 21 October 2006, Petrobangla wrote to
Niko and BAPEX, informing them that the Government of
Bangladesh had “approved the initialled (31.07.2006) Gas
Purchase and Sale Agreement of Marginal Gas Field Feni’.76

The GPSA was executed on 27 December 2006. It fixed a price
of US$1.75 per thousand cubic feet of gas for the period of the
agreement.

Most of the correspondence referred to in this account of the
events leading to the execution of the GPSA was copied by Niko
and by Petrobangla to the Ministry of Power, Energy & Mineral
Resources and, occasionally, also to the Prime Minister’s office.

3.4 The arbitration clause in the GPSA

The draft of the interim GPSA, sent by Niko to Petrobangla on
5S December 2005, contained a clause for expert determination
of price disputes. With respect to any other dispute it provided
for arbitration under the Rules of the International Chamber of
Commerce (ICC) with a seat in Singapore or elsewhere as
mutually agreed by the Parties.77 In subsequent drafts this
clause remained largely unchanged’® until, in March 2006, Niko
abandoned the attempt to reach an interim agreement.

From then on, a different text formed the basis for the
negotiations of the GPSA. The first draft of this text produced in
these proceedings is the version which, according to the
testimony of Mr Adolf, Niko prepared on the basis of an
electronic text received from Petrobangla, as described above in
paragraph 80.

88.

The drafts which then were exchanged and discussed contained
a clause which provides for ICSID arbitration in the same terms
as the JVA, with a reference to ICC arbitration if “ICSID fails or
refuses to take jurisdiction over such dispute”. The complete
and final text of the arbitration clause is contained in Article 13
of the GPSA and reads as follows:

“13.5 The Parties shall make their best efforts to settle
amicably through consultation any dispute arising in
connection with the performance or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement.

13.2 If any dispute, mentioned in Article 13.1, has not been
settled through such consultation within ninety (90) days
after the dispute arises, either Party may, by notice to the
other Party, propose that the dispute be referred either for
determination by a sole expert or to arbitration in
accordance with the provisions of this Article.

13.3 Following the giving of notice under Article 13.2, the
Parties may, by mutual Agreement, refer the dispute for
determination by a sole expert to be appointed by
Agreement between the Parties.

13.4 As an alternative to the procedure described in Article
13.3 and if agreed upon by the Parties, such dispute shall
be referred to arbitration by an agreed sole arbitrator.

13.5 If the Parties fail to refer such dispute to a sole expert
under Article 13.3 or to a Sole Arbitrator under Article 13.4,
within sixty (60) days of the giving of notice, such dispute
shall be referred to the International Centre for Settlement
of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) and the Parties hereby
consent to arbitration under the Treaty establishing ICSID.
If for any reason, ICSID fails or refuses to take jurisdiction
over such dispute, the dispute shall be finally settled by
International Chamber of Commerce.

13.8 Arbitration pursuant to Article 13.4 shall be by an
arbitration tribunal consisting of three (3) arbitrators. The
Parties shall each appoint an arbitrator and the two (2)
arbitrators so appointed shall designate a third arbitrator.
If one of the Parties does not appoint its arbitrator within
sixty (60) days after the first appointment or if two (2)
arbitrators, once appointed, fail to appoint the third within
sixty (60) days after the appointment of the second
arbitrator, the relevant appointment shall be made in

34

89.

accordance with the rules of ICSID or the International
Chamber of Commerce, as the case may be.

13.7 The arbitrators shall be citizens of countries that have
formal diplomatic relations with both Bangladesh and
Canada and any home country of the entities comprising
the Seller, and shall not have any economic interest in or
economic relationship with the Parties.

13.8 The Sole Arbitrator or the arbitration tribunal shall
conduct the arbitration in accordance with the arbitration
rules of ICSID. However, if the above-mentioned arbitration
rules are in conflict with the provisions of this Article 13,
including the provisions concerning appointment of
arbitrators, the provisions of this Article 13 shall prevail.

13.9 The English language shall be the language used in
arbitral proceedings. All hearing materials, statements of
claim or defense, award and the reasons supporting them
shall be in English.

13.10 The place of arbitration shall be Dhaka or elsewhere
as mutually agreed by the Parties.

13.11 Any arbitration award given pursuant to this Article
13 shall be final and binding upon the Parties and shall be
enforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction on the
same basis as obligations between private parties, and
any reference in this Agreement to such an award shall
include any determination by a sole expert.

13.12 The right to arbitrate disputes under this Agreement
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.”

The Tribunal discussed at length with Mr Adolf the origin of the
draft containing this arbitration clause and the negotiations
about the clause. According to his testimony, the clause was not
subject to negotiations and remained as it had been in the draft
of March 2006, originating from Petrobangla. At the end of the
discussion the Chairman of the Tribunal drew the following
conclusion:

“From this evidence we must conclude that the clause, as it
was in the final agreement, was put by Petrobangla.

We put it to both parties, if there is evidence to counter this
assumption which we must draw from the evidence before

35

90.

91.

92.

93.

94.

us, both parties are invited to produce this evidence so that
if we are wrong in this conclusion that we can correct our
conclusion.”79

No contrary evidence was produced thereafter. The Tribunal
concludes that the clause providing for ICSID arbitration was as
originally put forward by Petrobangla which, as shown above,
acted in close consultation with and under instructions of the
Government.

3.5 The Payment Claims under the GPSA

After the GPSA had been executed, Niko invoiced Petrobangla on
10 January 2007 for the gas produced from inception of gas
production in November 2004 to December 2006. These and
subsequent invoices were not paid. After several reminders,
Niko sent on 30 September 2007 a Notice of Default to
Petrobangla, claiming payment of the outstanding amounts.®°

At the Joint Management Committee meeting No 8 on 25 March
2008, Niko and BAPEX reviewed the payments outstanding from
Petrobangla. Niko requested that arbitration be commenced
immediately against Petrobangla under the GPSA; however
BAPEX did not agree.®!

On 8 January 2010 Niko served Notice of Arbitration on
Petrobangla under the GPSA.82. By a separate Notice of the
same date, Niko joined BAPEX to the arbitration commenced
against Petrobangla.®° This was followed by the two Requests for
Arbitration on 1 April and 16 June 2010, the latter of which
concerned the outstanding payments under the GPSA.

3.6 The blowouts and the Compensation Claim

On 7 January 2005 the first blowout occurred in the No 2 Well
of the Chattak field.

Starting on 9 January 2005 the Government of Bangladesh
formed a number of enquiry committees to determine the
causes of the fire and assess various categories of losses. The
first committee report was submitted on 10 February 2005 and
held Niko responsible for the blowout. Subsequent reports
confirmed Niko’s responsibility and assessed the quantity and
value of the gas lost, the damage to the local population,
environmental damage and other losses.84

On 24 June 2005 a second blowout occurred in the Chattak gas
field at the Relief Well Chattak 2A.

Niko was held responsible also for this blowout.

In the fall of 2005 the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers’
Association (BELA) and others issued a petition in the Supreme
Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, against the
Government of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, BAPEX, Niko and
others, seeking inter alia a determination that the JVA was
invalid, that the payments made in respect of Feni gas
purchases by Petrobangla were without lawful authority and an
injunction restraining payments to Niko in respect to the Feni
gas field or on any other account (the BELA Proceedings).®>

In the course of these proceedings injunctions were issued on
which, as stated above, Petrobangla relied when suspending
payments under the GPSA.

On 27 May 2008 Petrobangla served on Niko legal notice
claiming Tk746.50 crore as damages for the blowouts.8¢

Niko responded on 9 June 2008, denying liability for any
damages arising from the blowouts at Chattak and that
Petrobangla suffered the alleged damage. It added that the
claims brought by Petrobangla had to be resolved by arbitration
and that it was willing to resolve the issues between the Parties

proceedings, RfA II, Attachment M, pp. 14-16.

through arbitration conducted through ICSID, as agreed
between the Parties.87

102. Sometime “in or about” June 2008 the People’s Republic of
Bangladesh and Petrobangla, further to the notice of 27 May
2008 served by Petrobangla, commenced proceedings in the
Court of the District Judge in Dhaka against Niko, two of its
executives, GSM Inc. and its drilling manager. They claimed
damages in the amount specified in the Notice (these
proceedings are referred to as the Money Suit).8°

103. The High Court Division rendered its decision in the BELA
proceedings on 5 May 2010. It found that the “JVA was not
obtained by flawed process by resorting to fraudulent means”.®9
Concerning the claim for compensation it made the following
order:

“_.. Niko is directed to pay the compensation money as per
the decision to be taken in the money suit now pending in
the Court of the Joint District or as per the mutual
agreement among the parties. The respondents are
restrained by an order of injunction form making any
payment to respondent No 10. This order of injunction shall
remain in force till disposal of the money suit or till
amicable settlement amongst the parties, whichever is
earlier.”°°

104. The Claimant states that it discussed with Bangladesh and
Petrobangla the prospect of submitting the claims for damages
arising from the blowouts to ICSID arbitration and that
Bangladesh and Petrobangla “appeared to be in agreement that
the claims could be arbitrated under ICSID provided the
arbitration was held in Dhaka’. It presents a letter by its
Counsel to a lawyer in Dhaka.9? No other written evidence for
these negotiations has been produced. In any event the
Claimant does not contend that agreement was reached in this
respect.

THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY

4.1 From Registration to the Constitution of the two
Tribunals

Since the two cases were filed at separate dates, the initial
history of this arbitration must be considered separately for
each of the two cases. As explained in the introduction to this
Decision, the two Tribunals constituted in the two cases are
referred to collectively as “the Tribunal”.

4.1.1 ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11

On 12 April 2010 ICSID received a Request for Arbitration,
dated 1 April 2010, from Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd.
against the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Petrobangla and
BAPEX (the First Request or RfA I).

In RfA I Niko stated that it was seeking resolution by ICSID
arbitration of the dispute which the named Respondents had
brought against Niko and others in the Court of District Judge,
Dhaka, Bangladesh, claiming damages alleged to arise from the
two well blowouts in the Chattak field (the Compensation
Claims). It stated that it also sought to “recover payment of
amounts due for gas delivered’.

In accordance with Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure for the
Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the
ICSID Institution Rules), the Centre acknowledged receipt of
the First Request on 13 April 2010, and transmitted a copy of it
to the three Respondents.

By letter of 7 May 2010, the Centre requested clarifications from
Niko concerning the First Request, to which the Claimant
responded under cover of a letter of 18 May 2010 (RfA I
Clarification). It named Professor Jan Paulsson as its appointee
to the Arbitral Tribunal.

On 27 May 2010 the Acting Secretary-General registered the

Claimant’s First Request, as supplemented on 18 May 2010,
pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of

40

112.

113.

114.

115.

116.

Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other
States (ICSID Convention or Convention) as ICSID Case No.
ARB/10/11. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID
Institution Rule 7, the Acting Secretary-General notified the
Parties of the registration and invited them to proceed, as soon
as possible, to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal.

By letter of 21 June 2010 addressed to the Acting Secretary-
General, the Respondents raised certain objections to the
Centre’s jurisdiction and indicated a proposal regarding the
constitution of the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11 (R-
Preliminary Objections). In these objections the Respondents
stated that the Claimant had “failed to show how Bangladesh
and Petrobangla (or even BAPEX) have consented to ICSID
arbitration in the matters referred to arbitration’.

The Centre acknowledged receipt of the letter on 24 June 2010
and reminded the Parties that, as provided by Articles 41 and
42 of the ICSID Convention, the registration of a request for
arbitration by the Centre is without prejudice to the powers and
functions of the Arbitral Tribunal with respect to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction and the merits.

The Claimant made comments on the Respondents’ letters of 21
and 24 June 2010 by letter of 30 June 2010.

Following several rounds of communications regarding the
method of constituting the Tribunal, the Respondents wrote on
26 August 2010 and invoked the formula concerning the
method of constituting the Tribunal provided for in Article
37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was thus to be
composed of three arbitrators, one appointed by each Party, and
the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of
the Parties. The Respondents appointed Professor Campbell
McLachlan as arbitrator and proposed Mr Gavan Griffith, a
national of Australia, as President of the Tribunal.

On 27 August 2010 the Centre informed the Parties that it
would seek from Professor McLachlan the acceptance of his
appointment, and that it would also proceed to seek the
acceptance of his appointment as arbitrator from Professor Jan
Paulsson, who had been nominated as arbitrator by the

41

117.

118.

119.

120.

121.

122.

123.

Claimant before the method of constituting the Tribunal had
been determined.

On the same date, the Claimant objected to the appointment of
Mr Griffith as President of the Tribunal.

By letter of 31 August 2010 the Centre informed the Parties that
both Professors McLachlan and Paulsson had accepted their
respective appointments as arbitrators.

On 17 September 2010 and further to its letter of 27 August
2010, the Claimant proposed Professor Guillermo Aguilar
Alvarez, a national of Mexico, as presiding arbitrator. By letter of
19 October 2010, the Respondents objected to this proposal,
and, on 23 October 2010, the Respondents proposed Professor
Georges Abi-Saab, a national of the Arab Republic of Egypt,
and, alternatively Dr S.K.B. Asante, a national of Ghana, as the
President of the Tribunal.

By letter of 16 November 2010 the Claimant objected to the
Respondents’ proposals of 23 October 2010, and requested that
the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appoint the
President of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 38 of the
ICSID Convention.

On 29 November 2010 the Centre invited the Parties to consider
candidates for presiding arbitrator by way of ballot procedure.
Each Party was to select one or more acceptable candidate(s)
from a list of candidates proposed to the Parties by the Centre.
In the event the Parties agreed on a mutually acceptable
candidate, that individual would be selected as the President of
the Tribunal; however, should the procedure not produce a
mutually acceptable candidate, the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council would make the appointment from the
ICSID Panel of Arbitrators pursuant to Article 38 of the
Convention.

By letter of 13 December 2010 the Centre informed the Parties
that they had agreed under the ballot procedure to appoint Mr

Michael E. Schneider to serve as President of the Tribunal.

On 20 December 2010 pursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the ICSID Arbitration

42

124.

125.

126.

127.

128.

129.

Rules), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that Mssrs.
Schneider, McLachlan and Paulsson had all accepted their
appointments, and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to
have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun on
20 December 2010. The Secretary-General further informed
the Parties that Ms Frauke Nitschke, Legal Counsel, ICSID,
would serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

4.1.2 ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18

On 23 June 2010 the Centre received a further Request for
Arbitration from Niko, dated 16 June 2010, against the same
three Respondents, i.e., the People’s Republic of Bangladesh,
Petrobangla and BAPEX (the Second Request or RfA II).9* Niko
stated that it sought by this new Request “to resolve all claims to
payment under the GPSA and recover payment of amounts due
for gas delivered’ (the Payment Claims). It clarified that the First
Request concerned the Compensation Claims.

The Centre acknowledged receipt of the Second Request by
letter of 28 June 2010 and transmitted a copy of it to the three
Respondents.

On 28 July 2010 the Second Request was registered by the
Acting Secretary-General pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID
Convention, and assigned ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18.

By letter of 9 September 2010 the Claimant requested that,
based on the similarity and overlap of issues between ICSID
Case Nos. ARB/10/11 and ARB/ 10/18, an identical tribunal be
constituted in the two cases, and nominated Professor Paulsson
as arbitrator.

By letter of 10 September 2010, the Centre reminded the Parties
that the number of arbitrators and the method of their
appointment had to be determined in ICSID Case No.
ARB/10/18 before any appointment could take effect.

On 19 October 2010 the Respondents requested that the
Tribunal be constituted in accordance with the formula

+ Tn that request the three Respondents are presented in an order different from that in the First
Request. In this arbitration, the order of the First Request is adopted throughout.

43

130.

133.

134.

contained in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and
appointed Professor McLachlan as arbitrator. In their letter, the
Respondents further indicated that they “recognize that ICSID
Case Nos. ARB/ 10/11 and ARB/10/18 may be linked so that
the modality for the constitution of the Arbitration Tribunal, the
Arbitrators and the President of the Arbitration Tribunal in both
proceedings may be the same.”

On the same day, the Centre confirmed that the Tribunal was to
be constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the
Convention and informed the Parties that it would seek from
Professors McLachlan and Paulsson the acceptance of their
respective appointments. By letters of 21 and 28 October 2011,
the Centre informed the Parties that they had accepted their
appointments.

On 16 November 2010 the Claimant requested the Chairman of
the ICSID Administrative Council to appoint the President of the
Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/10/18, and clarified by letter
of 18 November 2010 that it wished that an identical tribunal be
constituted in ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18.

On 29 November 2010 the Centre invited the Parties to consider
appointing the presiding arbitrator in ICSID Case No.
ARB/10/18 by way of ballot procedure, as in Case No.
ARB/10/11.

By letter of 13 December 2010 the Centre informed the Parties
that they had agreed under the ballot procedure to appoint Mr
Michael E. Schneider to serve as President of the Tribunal in
ICSID Case No. ARB/ 10/18.

On 20 December 2010 the Secretary-General notified the Parties
that Mssrs. Schneider, McLachlan and Paulsson had accepted
their appointments and that the Tribunal in ICSID Case No.
ARB/ 10/18 was therefore deemed to have been constituted and
the proceedings to have begun on 20 December 2010. The
Secretary-General further informed the Parties that Ms Frauke
Nitschke would serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

138.

4.2 Following the Constitution of the two Tribunals

Following an agreement between the Parties and the Tribunal
constituted in the two cases, on 14 February 2011 the President
of the Tribunal held joint preliminary procedural
consultations in ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18
pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 20 with the Parties in
Geneva on 14 February 2011.

Present at the preliminary procedural consultations were: Mr
Michael E Schneider, President of the Tribunal; Ms Frauke
Nitschke, Secretary of the Tribunal; Mr Kenneth J Warren, QC,
for the Claimant; and Mr Tawfique Nawaz and Mr Mohammad
Imtiaz Farooq for the Respondents. In preparation for the
procedural consultation, the Tribunal had adopted a proposed
agenda and its Members had discussed the issues on these
agenda. The Parties did not object to the absence of the two
other arbitrators at the preliminary procedural consultations.

Subsequently, on the same day, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration
Rule 13, the Tribunal held its Joint First Session with the
Parties in Geneva, with the two co-arbitrators joining by way of
video-conference. As previously agreed by the Parties, the
preliminary procedural consultations and the First Session were
held jointly for both ICSID Case Nos. ARB/10/11 and
ARB/ 10/18.

The consultations and the Joint First Session considered
matters of procedure regarding the conduct and organization of
the arbitration. The Claimant clarified the relief sought, stating
in particular that, with respect to the Compensation Claim it
sought a declaration of no liability for any of the blowout
damage (Compensation Declaration).°° The Parties agreed that
the two cases were to proceed in a concurrent manner, and that
the Tribunal may issue one single instrument in relation to both
cases, and may discuss the two cases jointly except where
circumstances distinct to one case necessitate a separate
treatment. The Parties also agreed that the applicable
arbitration rules would be the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force
as of 10 April 2006, that the place of proceedings would be
London, United Kingdom and that the language of the

144.

arbitration would be English. They confirmed that the Tribunal
was properly constituted in the two cases and that they had no
objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal.

At the Joint First Session the Tribunal and the Parties
considered the procedural timetable. It was decided that, in a
first (and possibly final) phase of the two arbitrations, the
Respondents’ objections to jurisdiction would be heard. After
consultation with the Parties, the procedural timetable for the
written and oral procedure on jurisdiction was issued in
Procedural Order No. 1.

Summary Minutes of the consultations and the Joint First
Session were prepared as well as sound recordings. These were
subsequently distributed by the Centre to the Parties and the
Members of the Tribunal.

Further to the discussion at the Joint First Session, the
Tribunal gave directions in Procedural Order No. 1 with respect
to inter alia a possible counter-claim. It directed that the
Respondents, if they wished to oppose the Payment Claim on
the grounds of a claim for the compensation of the damage from
the well blowouts (Compensation Claim), they must raise this
claim with their First Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 1 April 2011 the
Claimant filed its First Memorial on Jurisdiction for the
Payment Claim (C-MJ), which included a request for the
Respondent to produce certain documents.

On 16 May 2011 the Respondents filed their First Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction on the Payment Claim (R-CMJ.1),
which included observations on the Claimant’s document
production request of 1 April 2011 but no counter-claim.

On 30 June 2011 the Claimant filed its Second Memorial on
Jurisdiction, described as the Claimant’s Response to the
Respondents’ First Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction for the
Payment Claim, and the Claimant’s Memorial on Jurisdiction for
the Compensation Claim (C-MJ.2) and reiterated its document
production request originally filed with its First Memorial on
Jurisdiction.

On 1 August 2011 the Respondents filed further observations
on the Claimant’s document production request of 1 April 2011.

On 16 August 2011 the Respondents filed a request for the
Tribunal to decide on production of documents. The Claimant
filed its observations on this request on 19 August 2011.

On 26 August 2011 the Tribunal decided on the admissibility of
the Respondents’ document production request and posed
questions to the Parties regarding document production issues
and certain allegations made by the Respondents concerning
the Claimant.

The Respondents responded to the Tribunal’s questions by letter
of 29 August 2011 and the Claimant by letters of 6 and 13
September 2011.

On 30 August 2011 the Respondents filed their Second
Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, described as_ the
Respondents’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction for the Payment Claim
(R-CMJ.2 - Payment Claim).

On 13 September 2011 the Tribunal requested further
clarifications from the Claimant regarding criminal
investigations notified to the Claimant or to another person or
company acting on the Claimant’s instructions or on its behalf,
to which the Claimant responded by letter of 22 September
2011.

On 15 September 2011 the President of the Tribunal held a pre-
hearing organisational meeting by telephone conference with
the Parties to discuss the conduct and organisation of the
hearing on jurisdiction. Prior to this telephone conference the
Tribunal had addressed to the Parties a List of Points for
Discussion which served as the basis for the discussion with
them.

The following persons participated in the organisational
meeting: Mr Michael E. Schneider, President of the Tribunal; Ms
Frauke Nitschke, Secretary of the Tribunal; Mr Kenneth J
Warren, QC, and Mr Ajmalul Hossain, QC, for the Claimant;
and Mr Tawfique Nawaz, Mr Mohammad Imtiaz Farooq, Mr Luis
Gonzalez Garcia and Ms _ Alison Macdonald, for the

47

153.

154.

155.

156.

157.

158.

Respondents. The Parties confirmed that they had no objection
to the pre-hearing organisational meeting being conducted by
the President alone.

At the pre-hearing organisational meeting the President
discussed with the Parties in particular questions relating to the
conduct of the hearing and witness testimony, the scope of the
jurisdictional issues and outstanding issues concerning the
document production requests. A procedure was agreed for
further submissions with respect to these requests and the
response to the questions of the Tribunal.

Summary Minutes of the organisational meeting and the sound
recordings were distributed to the Parties and the Members of
the Tribunal on 19 September 2011.

In the course of the organisational meeting, the Respondents
requested leave to file a Supplemental Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction, responding in particular to the Claimant’s
presentation concerning the Compensation Declaration. On 19
September 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2,
granting the Respondents’ request to file a further submission
on jurisdiction, and allowing the Claimant to file observations
on the Respondents’ further submission prior to the hearing on
jurisdiction.

On 20 September 2011 the Claimant filed answers related to
document production questions posed by the President during
the pre-hearing telephone conference.

On 27 September 2011 the Respondents addressed certain
questions relating to the replies which the Claimant had given
in its submissions of 6 and 22 September 2011.

On 28 September 2011 the Respondents filed observations on
the Claimant’s letter of 20 September 2011 and, in a separate
document, their Supplemental Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction (R-CMJ.2 - Compensation Declaration), described
as Respondents’ Response to the Claimant’s Presentation of its
Position with respect to the Request for the Compensation
Declaration.

The Claimant filed its observations thereon on 10 October 2011
in a submission entitled Reply to the Respondents’ Response
with respect to the Compensation Declaration (C-MJ.3).

A hearing on jurisdiction was held on 13 and 14 October 2011
in London. In addition to the three Members of the Tribunal and
the Secretary, the following persons participated in the
jurisdictional hearing:

For the Claimant:

Mr Kenneth J Warren, QC, Mr James T Eamon, QC, and Ms
Erin Runnalls of Gowlings, Calgary, and Mr Ajmalul
Hossain, QC, of A. Hossain & Associates, Dhaka.

For the Respondents:

Mr Tawfique Nawaz, Senior Advocate, and Mr Mohammad
Imtiaz Farooq of Juris Counsel, Dhaka, and Mr Luis
Gonzalez Garcia and Ms Alison Macdonald of Matrix
Chambers, London.

In the course of the hearing, the Members of the Tribunal
sought to clarify certain issues raised in the Parties’ written
submissions on jurisdiction. Mr Brian Adolph, Regional
Manager, Middle East/Madagascar of Niko Canada and, from
January 2005 to December 2007 Country Manager for Niko,
and Mr Imam Hossain, Secretary, Petrobangla, testified as
witnesses. Further to Procedural Order No. 1 the Parties had
submitted descriptions of the facts on which these witnesses
were expected to testify, the Claimant with C-MJ.1 and the
Respondents with R-CMJ.1. The Parties were given an
opportunity to question the witnesses, to develop their case
orally, and to respond to the Tribunal’s questions.

Following the witness testimony, the Tribunal declared the
record on jurisdiction closed and confirmed this in the
Summary Minutes of the hearing.

Following the Parties’ closing submissions, the Tribunal
enquired whether the Parties wished to raise any points of
complaint with regard to the conduct of the procedure, which
the Tribunal could address and rectify if necessary. The Parties
confirmed that they did not have any such points they wished to
raise, and the hearing was declared closed.

THE CLAIMANT - ITS IDENTITY AND ITS NATIONALITY

The Claimant describes itself as Niko Resources (Bangladesh)
Ltd. The Respondents argue that this company “is not the real
claimant in this arbitration”.

5.1 The position of the Parties

The Claimant relies on the fact that both agreements are
concluded by a company described Niko Resources
(Bangladesh) Ltd., and indicate that this company has its “Head
Office at P.O. Box 261, Bay Street, Bridgetown, Barbados”. The
JVA also states that the company so identified is “a corporation
organised under the laws of Barbados”.

It is undisputed that the company so identified is registered in
Barbados. The Claimant states that it also has its Head Office
there and that it at a later date “designated a primary office in
Cyprus”.°©

The Respondents argue that Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd.
“is not the real claimant in this arbitration”. According to the
Respondents it “is clear that the registered office of the Claimant
is one of convenience, and that the real investor in Bangladesh
and, therefore the real Claimant was and continues to be Niko
Resources Ltd., a Canadian company’.°” The parent company of
the Claimant is indeed Niko Resources Ltd., a company
registered in Canada with a head office in Calgary, Canada.

Barbados is a Contracting State of the ICSID Convention since 1
December 1983. Canada signed the ICSID Convention on 15
December 2006 but has not ratified it. At the commencement of
the arbitration it was not a Contracting State, and is not one
today. Cyprus is a Contracting State since 25 December 1966.

In support of their position, the Respondents rely primarily on
the following facts or allegations: Niko Canada owns and is in
full control of Niko Bangladesh; it carried out all the necessary

°° C-MJ-2, paragraph 111.
°T R-CMJ-1, paragraph 83.
°8 Claimant's Exhibit 15, p. 985.

Sl

technical studies; its executives negotiated and signed the JVA
and the GSPA; Niko Bangladesh has no office, employees, assets
or business in Barbados or Cyprus, and its managerial
positions are held by Canadian nationals and employees of Niko
Canada.

173. The argument of the Respondents, in substance, has two prongs
which are related but different:

e The first prong concerns the identity of the Claimant, the
Respondents arguing that the corporate entity of the
Barbados company is only a facade (used for “convenience”)
or “just a shell’,!°° while the true investor is the Canadian
company; this line of argument disregards the separate legal
personality of the Barbados company and absorbs it by the
parent company. The Respondents “request the Tribunal to
lift the corporate veil of Niko Bangladesh’.

e The other prong seems to recognise the distinct legal
personality of the Claimant but takes the position that,
because of its control by a Canadian company, the
nationality of the Claimant company was not that of
Barbados. Thus the Respondents argue that the “parties to
the GPSA and JVA knew and agreed that the real nationality
of Niko was Canadian”.!°! They argue that “there must be
real connection between the investor and the State of its
nationality” !°2 and, quoting Schreuer, insist that the tribunal
should “take a realistic look at the true controllers ...”.103

5.2 The Claimant’s identity

174. The Respondents do not question that under the law of
Barbados and of Canada, the Claimant and Niko Canada have
distinct legal personality and are separate corporate entities;
however, they insist that this distinct legal personality does not
correspond to economic reality.

According to the Respondents the “party which financed,
negotiated, operated and was the decision-maker under the JVA
and GPSA was Niko Canada. [...] It is clear from the evidence
that Niko Bangladesh is fully controlled and dominated by Niko
Canada.” 10+

The Claimant “acknowledges that it engaged the services of the
parent and other affiliated corporations from time to time to
augment its internal capabilities”.!°5 In reality, the contributions
of Niko Canada and the Claimant’s group most likely were
provided not just “from time to time”; these contributions must
have been substantial and regular. From the explanations
provided by the Claimant at the hearing the Claimant’s activity
in Barbados consisted essentially of holding board meetings
there. 106

The Tribunal considers that, in principle it is for the investor to
decide how it wishes to structure its investment and what
corporate organisation it wishes to adopt for the investment,
including the manner in which resources, activities and control
are allocated between different corporate vehicles. The
corporate structure of the investment is indeed part of the
investor’s prerogatives and responsibility. Depending on the
structure adopted, the corporate vehicle used for the investment
which becomes party to the investment contract may rely on the
resources of the group to which it belongs to secure the
investment, including funding, technology or _ other
contributions.

Distinct corporate identities serve a legitimate function in the
cross-border mobilisation of investment. As long as the
contracting parties are not mislead about the corporate
structure and no laws and regulations are violated, there should
be no objection to the choice made by the investor in this
respect.

In the present case, the Respondents were well aware of the
corporate structure used for the investment. In the two
agreements, the Claimant is clearly identified as a company

organised under the laws of Barbados, in terms that have been
quoted above. The identification of a Barbados company as
contracting partner, and not the Canadian parent, did not go
unnoticed. The Respondents were fully aware of the corporate
structure and the choice of a Barbados company for the
agreements, as the following incident demonstrates:

On 22 July 2003, a few months before the execution of the JVA,
a meeting of the Petrobangla Board of Directors was held at
which a number of questions were addressed concerning the
transaction with Niko. In the resolution of the Board of which
the Respondents have produced extracts, a number of questions
were addressed which the Ministry had raised. One of these
questions concerned “explaining the registration in Barbados
instead of Canada”. The Board of Petrobangla provided detailed
explanations on the corporate structure of the Niko group which
show that the choice of a Barbadian subsidiary rather than the
Canadian parent was a matter carefully considered by the
Respondents and accepted by them. 107

Similarly, the substantive and regular contributions from the
parent company to Niko were known to the Respondents; indeed
they relied on them. For instance, the Respondents point out
that the initial report evaluating the fields was prepared by Niko
Canada and that, at a number of subsequent occasions, the
parent company intervened in its own name.!°8 Indeed, the
Respondents do not contest that the full control of Niko Canada
over the Claimant was known to them.

The Tribunal concludes that the choice of the Barbadian
company as the party engaged on the Niko side was made in full
knowledge of the Respondents and after careful consideration.
It sees no justification for the Respondents now to question this
choice. For the purposes of the arbitration clause and
jurisdiction the party to the JVA and the GSPA is the Barbadian
company acting as the Claimant.

This being said, the Tribunal has not overlooked that the use of
a corporate vehicle without resources and activity may give rise
to objections when the company chosen as the investor does not

meet its obligations. In such a situation it may have to be
examined whether the group of companies behind the investor
may ultimately be shielded by the separate legal personality of a
corporation which turns out to be “just a shell’. This question
need not be examined any further here since the Respondents
have not raised any such claims against Niko in this arbitration,
although an opportunity was given for them to do so.

5.3 The Claimant’s nationality

The Respondents question that the true nationality of the
Claimant is that of Barbados. They argue that it could also be
that of Cyprus but that it should ultimately be Canadian.

5.3.1 The link with Cyprus

The Respondents argue that in 2006 the head office of Niko was
moved to Cyprus and that, by the time the GPSA was signed,
Niko “was already a Cyprus national” .109

The Claimant relies on its incorporation in Barbados but
accepts that “starting with about October 2006 there were
directors meetings in Cyprus and eventually there was a place of
business that was created in Cyprus”.1!° But the place of
incorporation did not change and, in the Claimant’s view, that
was sufficient for continued Barbados nationality.11!

It is uncontested that Niko was incorporated in Barbados. The
Claimant has produced its Certificate of Incorporation, issued
by the Deputy Registrar of Companies, showing as the date of
incorporation 4 September 1997.112 The Claimant also
produced the Articles of Incorporation,!!% the By-laws of the
company,!!4 and minutes of meetings of directors and
shareholders. The By-laws provide in their section 2.1:

“The registered office of the Company shall be in Barbados
at such address as the directors may fix from time to time
by resolution.” 115

The registered office is recorded as being in Barbados at
Worthington Corporate Centre, Worthington Main Road, Christ
Church, Barbados, with the mailing address at P.O. Box 261,
Bridgetown, Barbados. Either the registered office or the
mailing address is indicated on the Claimant’s letterhead of
documents produced by the Claimant; on some of the
documents it is the mailing address which is shown. The
agreements locate the “head office” of the Claimant at the
mailing address.

The documents produced by the Claimant also include an
International Business Company License, issued under the
Barbados International Business Companies Act, confirming
that it was authorised to “conduct international business with
effect from September 4, 1997 in accordance with the provisions
of the International Business Companies Act, Cap. 77’, as well as
renewals of this license until 31 December 2011.!16

Among the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors are
those of 30 September 1999, which record a review of the
Framework of Understanding with BAPEX and the decision to
retain Stratum Development Ltd. (Stratum) “to assist in
securing the opportunities in the Chattak, Feni and Kamta gas
fields and to act on behalf of the Company, as its management
company, in Bangladesh” .117

The evidence shows that until 2006 Niko was not only
incorporated in Barbados but also had its head office there.
Some change occurred in 2006.

On 26 October 2006 a meeting of the Board of Directors is
recorded, which decided “the Company’s migration to Cyprus”.'18
However, the company continued to identify itself as a “private
company registered in Barbados” adding “principal place of

business in Cyprus under registration number AE-2221”.119
Meetings of the Board of Directors continued to be held
“pursuant to Section 82(1) of the Companies Act CAP. 308” of
Barbados, as recorded in minutes of these meetings. !2°

The status of the Claimant company is clarified by Certificates
of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism,
Department of Registrar of Companies and Official Receiver,
Nicosia. On 12 February 2007 the Registrar certified that Niko
Resources (Bangladesh) Limited, “which was formed in
Barbados, was recorded today as an Overseas Company after
filing documents under the Companies Law, Cap. 113, Section
347’. On 23 September 2008 the Registrar clarified the position
of the Company in Cyprus:

“It is hereby certified that, in accordance with the records
kept by this Department, the above Overseas Company has
established a Place of Business in the Republic of Cyprus
at the following address: ....”!?1

Shortly thereafter, on 10 November 2008, a change of directors
of Niko took place; it was recorded on 22 December 2008 under
the Companies Act of Barbados by the Barbados Corporate
Affairs and Intellectual Property Office under the Claimant’s
Barbados registration number. !22

The Tribunal concludes that Niko Resources (Barbados) Ltd.
was validly incorporated under the laws of Barbados in 1997.
In 2007, this company established a place of business in
Cyprus and was registered there as “Overseas Company”. Its
status as corporation registered in Barbados was not affected by
this registration in Cyprus.

Consequently, the Claimant company was, at the time of
consent to the two agreements in 2003 and 2006, a company
incorporated and registered in Barbados. This status continued
thereafter and there is no reason to conclude that it has
changed since.

5.3.2 The link with Canada

While recognising that incorporation is an accepted basis for
determining the nationality of a corporation, the Respondent
argues that “there is no basis to conclude that the test of
incorporation is the only criterion for the determination of a
juridical person’s nationality under the Convention’.125
According to the Respondents “international law permits the
Tribunal to disregard the formal corporate structure of the
Claimant in order to determine the real nationality of the
investor’. 124

Relying on authorities dealing with treaty claims and diplomatic
protection, the Respondents assert that a “real connection” is
required “between a corporation and the home State”, “some
substantial and effective connection between the legal entity and
the claimant state” and that there “is a tendency in international
treaty practice towards a requirement of connection beyond the
mere fact of incorporation’.!25 They make reference to the
decisions of the ICJ in the Nottebohm and the Barcelona Traction
cases,!26 as well as a number of investment treaty cases; they
argue that reliance of the Claimant on its Barbados nationality
“amounts to an abuse of the ICSID system”.'27

The Respondents refer to statements by representatives of Niko
Canada and to support from Canadian authorities to argue that
the “real connection” existed with Canada and that “the parties
to the JVA and the GPSA agreed to treat Niko Bangladesh as a
Canadian company’.'28

Article 25 of the Convention provides for jurisdiction over
disputes between a Contracting State and a “national of another
Contracting State”, but it does not establish criteria for
determining corporate nationality. There is wide consensus that

204.

incorporation and head office are the principal criteria to
establish nationality. 129

The Respondents’ argument, as presented above, amounts to
saying (a) that incorporation alone is not sufficient but must
reflect a “real connection” to the place of incorporation and (b)
that the parties to the arbitration agreement may agree to treat
a juridical person as a national of another State than that of
incorporation and that in the present case they have done so.

The authorities to which the Respondents referred the Tribunal,
to the (limited) extent to which they support their argument,
concern claims brought in diplomatic protection or under an
investment treaty where the consent of the State to arbitration
or to jurisdiction of the ICJ was given in a general form. In the
present case, the Respondents have consented to ICSID
arbitration of disputes arising out of two specific agreements
with a specific company.

The Respondents have not presented any authorities to support
their view that a requirement of a “real connection”, assuming it
were applicable in diplomatic protection or in treaty claims,
should apply to contract claims as in the present case. In the
Tribunal’s view such an additional requirement cannot be read
into the text of the Convention; nor can the travaux
préparatoires for the Convention justify the assumption that
this had been intended. It is sufficient for a claimant to show
that it has the nationality of another Contracting State by
reference to one of the generally accepted criteria, in particular
incorporation or seat. 13°

With respect to their argument on an agreement about
nationality, the Respondents state that it “is well-settled that an
agreement on nationality would clarify the claimant’s nationality
for the purpose of the ICSID Convention and, as noted by
Schreuer, such agreement will carry ‘much weight”.'3! The
Tribunal agrees but adds, as Schreuer did, that an agreement
“cannot create a nationality that does not exist’. 152

The JVA identifies Niko as a “Company organised under the laws
of Barbados”; the Framework Understanding, also between
BAPEX and Niko, added to the description “organised and
existing under the laws of Barbados, having its Canada address
at [...] Calgary ...”._ BAPEX, with the approval of Petrobangla
and Bangladesh, has agreed to ICSID arbitration with this
company “existing under the laws of Barbados”. In the eyes of
the Tribunal, the Respondents thus have recognised the
Barbados nationality of Niko. As pointed out above, this
recognition was expressed consciously and after an examination
of the implications of this choice.

By their consent in these circumstances, Respondents have
accepted that their contracting partner was organised under the
laws of Barbados and had its head office there. The use of
ICSID arbitration by this company was fully accepted by the
Respondents at the time of their consent to arbitration. There is
no ground to assume that their consent was abused.

The references on which the Respondents rely in support of the
asserted “real connection” to Canada and agreement to treat
Niko as a Canadian company justify the conclusion that Niko
and its contracts with the Respondents had a link with Canada.
This is not surprising for a company forming part of a group
based in Canada. But it does not transform a company
organised under the laws of Barbados and having its registered
office there into a Canadian company.

The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant qualifies as a

national of Barbados, another Contracting State, in the sense of
Article 25 of the Convention.

211.

THE STATE OF BANGLADESH AS A PARTY TO THE
ARBITRATION

On the Bangladesh side the only contractually named parties
are BAPEX and Petrobangla. The JVA expressly defines the term
“Party”: only BAPEX and the Operator, i.e. Claimant, are
identified by this term.!53 The GPSA is concluded between
Petrobangla and the Joint Venture Partners, BAPEX and Niko.
The State of Bangladesh does not appear as party of either of
these agreements.

The Claimant nevertheless argues that Bangladesh is a party to
the GSPA “because the agreement was made by its agent or
instrumentality, or the parties intended it that it be a party.”!5+
The Claimant adds that “Bapex and Petrobangla are mere
instrumentalities or agents of the Government in respect of the
subject contracts. Whether the matter is viewed as an agency
relationship or as a lack of separate identity, the result is the
same. In the result, the GPSA is Bangladesh’s contract,
accordingly Bangladesh is compellable to arbitrate as a party
thereto”.135 In this context the Claimant also relies on a theory
of attribution, arguing that the acts of Petrobangla and BAPEX
should be attributed to the Government of Bangladesh. !3¢

The Respondents argue that the critical question here is that of
consent to arbitration under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention
and that this question of consent must be considered under
public international law.'!87 As to the substance of the
Claimant’s claim to jurisdiction, the Respondents argue that the
principles of attribution are not relevant to this issue, which
must be determined exclusively by reference to the question of
consent. According to the Respondents, the Government of
Bangladesh did not consent to arbitrate with the Claimant,
whether by approving the Agreements or otherwise. !38

The Tribunal shall consider the respective roles of the
Government of Bangladesh and of the two corporations, before
examining the arguments concerning attribution and consent.

6.1 The role of the Government of Bangladesh

As the Claimant points out, the project is of direct interest to
the Government: it concerns resources vested in the Republic.
The Government is in charge of their exploitation and has
organised and regulated it by legislation.

The JVA starts with a reminder of this role by pointing out in
the Preamble:

“1. All mineral resources including Petroleum within the
territory, continental shelf and economic zone of
Bangladesh are vested in the Republic of Bangladesh, and

2. The Government has, under the Bangladesh
Petroleum Act 1974 (Act No LXIX of 1974) (as amended up
to date) the exclusive right and authority to explore,
develop, exploit, produce, process, refine and market
Petroleum Resources within the territory, continental shelf
and economic zone of Bangladesh and it has also the
exclusive right to enter into Petroleum Agreements with any
persons for the purpose of any Petroleum Operations”.

As described in Section 3 above, the development of the present
project commenced when the parent company of the Claimant
addressed a preliminary proposal of 12 April 1997 to the
Bangladesh Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.
Eventually, this preliminary proposal was followed by a
presentation to the Minister which is expressly mentioned in the
Preamble of the JVA:

“OPERATOR |i.e. the Claimant] made a request in 1998 to
the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Gut. of the
Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to develop Marginal & Non
Producing Gas Fields of Bangladesh’.

This led to negotiations, and on 25 May 1999 the Minister gave
instructions for the implementation of the proposal. These

62

217.

218.

219.

220.

instructions included notice of the following decision taken by
the Government:

“A Joint Venture Agreement must be executed between
Bapex and Niko before a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) is signed with Niko. The Managing Director of Bapex
can conduct discussions with Niko regarding this.” 139

The evidence shows that the negotiations for this JVA were
conducted under the close supervision of the Government,
primarily the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, which
intervened at various stages normally through Petrobangla, and
gave directions, as described in Section 3 of this Decision. In
the course of these negotiations the Ministry of Energy and
Mineral Resources prepared a Procedure for Development of
Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields which was submitted to the
Prime Minister.!4° Eventually the draft JVA was approved by
the Prime Minister and BAPEX, again through Petrobangla, was
instructed to sign the JVA with Niko. !41

Similarly, the negotiations for the GPSA, including in particular
those for the price of the gas, were conducted in close
coordination with the Ministry. !42

The Tribunal concludes that the Government of Bangladesh
played a central role in the elaboration of the project and the
negotiations of the two contracts.

6.2 Petrobangla and BAPEX as agencies or
instrumentalities of the Government of Bangladesh

Petrobangla is a _ statutory corporation created by the
Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation Ordinance,
1985.43 As explained at the Hearing by the Respondents’
Counsel:

debts to the new corporation.

63

221.

223.

224.

“The Petrobangla Ordinance is also a special piece of
legislation creating Petrobangla and apportioning functions
between the Government, Petrobangla and enabling the
formation of the companies.” 14+

Petrobangla is created as a “body corporate”, with power to hold
and dispose of property and the capacity to sue and be sued. It
is governed by a Board of Directors, the members of which are
appointed by the Government or specified Ministries.

“The Board in discharging its functions shall act on
commercial considerations having due regard to public
interest generally and shall be guided on questions of
policy by such instructions as may be given to it by the
Government from time to time.” 145

The functions of Petrobangla include research in the fields of oil,
gas and minerals; the preparation and implementation of
programmes for the exploration, development, production, and
selling of those resources; and any other functions the
Government may from time to time assign to it. 146

The 1985 Ordinance expressly authorises Petrobangla “with the
previous approval in writing of the Government, [to] sponsor the
formation of subsidiary companies for exploration and
exploitation of oil, gas and mineral resources and may hold an
interest therein ...”147

The status, functions and powers of Petrobangla were set out in
the preamble to the JVA:

“3.  Petrobangla has the power to exercise rights and
powers of the Government to explore, develop,
exploit, produce, process, refine, market petroleum in
the territory, continental shelf and economic zone of
Bangladesh and also to enter into Petroleum
Agreements with any person/company for the
purpose of any Petroleum Operation”.

BAPEX is a_ wholly-owned subsidiary of Petrobangla
incorporated under the Companies Act of 1994.!48 Its powers,
functions and objects are governed by its memorandum of
association and articles of association. 149

In the JVA BAPEX is described as

“a wholly owned Company under Bangladesh Oil, Gas,
and Mineral Corporation (hereinafter called
‘PETROBANGLA’), a statutory corporation wholly owned
and established by the Government of the People’s
Republic of Bangladesh (hereinafter called the
Government)’.

The preamble of the JVA also sets out the position of BAPEX:

“12, BAPEX is vested with all rights free from all
encumbrances and liabilities whatsoever to assign,
develop, produce, process, refine and distribute
100% (One hundred percent) of all Petroleum
resources from or within the territory of the
Marginal/ Abandoned gas fields of Chattak & Feni.

15. BAPEX warrants that it has acquired from
Petrobangla and the Government the _ requisite
approvals to execute this JVA. The responsibilities
and obligations of Petrobangla and the Government
in all relevant Articles, Annexes and Amendments
under this JVA has been assign [sic] to Bapex.”

These factors indicate that Petrobangla and BAPEX exercise
functions which are vested in the Government and which the
Government has delegated to them. The Tribunal concludes
that both entities are agencies or instrumentalities of the
Government of Bangladesh in the sense of Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention.

6.3 The separate legal identity of Petrobangla and BAPEX

The Claimant argues that Petrobangla and BAPEX “are mere
instrumentalities or agents of the Government in respect of the
subject contracts” and that such situation can be viewed as “a
lack of separate identity” of the two entities. The consequence,
in the Claimant’s position, is, as mentioned above, that “the
GPSA is Bangladesh’s contract, accordingly Bangladesh is
compellable to arbitrate as party thereto”.15° According to the
Claimant, the same conclusion applies with respect to the
JVA.15!

Both Petrobangla and BAPEX are creations of the legal order of
Bangladesh. Their identity and legal status must be considered
first of all under the law of that State.

It follows from the legal provisions in the law of Bangladesh
which created Petrobangla and which govern its activities that it
has the essential attributes of legal personality. It is clearly a
distinct legal entity under the law of Bangladesh. The same
applies with respect to BAPEX, incorporated under the
Companies Act of 1994.152

The situation under the law of Bangladesh has been
summarised by the Respondents’ counsel:

“.. so we see that the Government is born of the
constitution, a statutory public authority such as
Petrobangla is recognised by the constitution as distinct
from the Government and then when we go to the other
part, that is the Companies Act, to the statute under which
there is authority given to Petrobangla to form a company,
there is another regime created and that is the company
law regime, the companies regime, where Petrobangla may
have an interest in equity but Bapex would be governed
entirely by the Companies act and not by the statute under
which it was born.” 153

238.

The Claimant insists on the control exercised by the
Government over Petrobangla. It is correct and undisputed that
the Government of Bangladesh exercises a high degree of
control over Petrobangla. This control clearly results from the
text of the 1985 Ordinance and other evidence produced. The
Government subscribed to the authorised capital, its Board is
composed of high ranking officers of, or other persons appointed
by, the Government, and the Government may give instructions
on questions of policy; as shown above the Government has
exercised these powers in the context of the contract with Niko.

Similarly, BAPEX, as wholly owned subsidiary of Petrobangla, is
fully under the control of that corporation and thus, indirectly,
by the Government. Here, too, the Government has exercised
its control, normally through Petrobangla.

However, control by one legal entity over another does not
extinguish the separation in law. Control by the Government
over these two entities does not deprive them of their separate
legal personality. They remain legally distinct from the
Government.

6.4 Petrobangla and BAPEX as agents for Bangladesh

The Claimant also argues that “private law principles of agency
could be applied to find that the Government is a party to the
Agreement’.'54+ It describes BAPEX and Petrobangla as “agents
of the Government in respect of the subject contracts” .155

At the hearing the Claimant explained that with respect to the
JVA the “party is Bapex in its capacity [as] the agent for the
Government’ and the same mutatis mutandis with respect to the
GPSA. 156

The Respondents deny that there is any statutory or contractual
agency role of either Petrobangla or BAPEX. 157

The Tribunal has concluded that BAPEX and Petrobangla are
separate legal entities under the law of Bangladesh. If they had
acted as agents for the State of Bangladesh, the party to the
agreements would be that State and not the agent. At some
stage the Claimant accepted this conclusion: “We would
acknowledge that if they are agents of the Government, then the
result would be that the Government is the party and the agents
are just the agents. They would not be liable as principals ...” 158

This is indeed the correct position: Petrobangla and BAPEX can
either be party to the agreements as principals, acting in their
own name, or else act as agents for the Government and then it
is the Government as the principal which is the party.

Since both BAPEX and Petrobangla have been clearly identified
as “party” to the agreements and not as agents for the
Government, the Tribunal concludes that Petrobangla and
BAPEX did not act as agents for and on behalf of the
Government when concluding the JVA and the GPSA.

6.5 Attribution

The Claimant relies on a theory of attribution with the objective
of establishing jurisdiction with respect to the Government of
Bangladesh. The Claimant writes:

“Niko submits that the acts of Petrobangla and Bapex in
making and breaching the GPSA should be attributed to the
Government for the purposes of this arbitration ...”159

In this context the Claimant referred to the Draft Articles on
Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts
adopted by the International Law Commission as “helpful in
assessing the matter’ .1©°

Since it has been accepted that Petrobangla and BAPEX are
agencies or instrumentalities of Bangladesh, their acts may well
be attributed to the State of Bangladesh, creating international
responsibility of that State. It is on this basis that, for instance

SSHT 1, p. 28.

1 C.MJ.1, paragraph 117.

68

245.

247.

the arbitral tribunal in the case Saipem S.p.A. v. Bangladesh!®!
considered that, at first sight at least, Petrobangla appeared to
be part of the State under Bangladeshi law, despite its distinct
legal personality. 162

Such attribution is relevant when it comes to determining the
question of whether a State has violated its international
obligations under general public international law or under a
treaty. In that context, the question is relevant also for
determining jurisdiction under a treaty by which the State
accepts to arbitrate disputes concerning the violation of its
treaty obligations; i.e., violations committed by itself or by
conduct attributed to it.

However, the issue to be considered here is not the
responsibility of Bangladesh for acts by Petrobangla and BAPEX
but the question whether Bangladesh has consented to arbitrate
with the Claimant. This is a matter for which the arbitration
agreement must be considered and the entities which are party
to it.

The Tribunal is aware that another ICSID tribunal, appointed
not in a treaty but a contract dispute,!®° applied rules on
attribution in the context of its analysis on jurisdiction. That
tribunal, relying on the conclusions of the Saipem tribunal and
other considerations, concluded that Petrobangla was an organ
of the State!6+ and that “Petrobangla’s actions are attributable to
Bangladesh”'®5 and found that it had jurisdiction with respect
to a contract to which Petrobangla but not Bangladesh was a
party. The question whether and under what circumstances
attribution may be a sufficient basis for assuming jurisdiction in
a contract dispute was not critical to the decision in the Chevron
case, since the Government had concluded with the investor a
contract containing an ICSID clause and the Chevron tribunal
found that the contract which the investor had concluded with

Petrobangla was related to the contract concluded by the
Government. !©©

In the present case the Government has not signed any
agreement with the investor and has not on its own behalf
agreed to ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal finds no basis on
which an attribution of actions of BAPEX and Petrobangla to
Bangladesh could justify the conclusion that the State of
Bangladesh has agreed to arbitrate the present contract
disputes with Niko.

6.6 Consent

Finally, the Claimant argues that, alternatively, “the
circumstances demonstrate an objective intention by the parties
that the Government would be bound to the Agreements”.'°7 This
argument seems to be based on “legitimate expectations” that
the JVA obligations, “which only the Government and
Petrobangla could give”, would be met. The Claimant states:

“These expectations override countervailing considerations
such as that the Government was not explicitly named as a
Party in the GPSA. The reality is that the JVA contains
many obligations on the part of the Government, leading
inexorably to the conclusion that it was in substance the
Government’s agreement. [...] the Government's control and
approval of the Agreements also constitutes the
Government’s agreement to be bound by the Agreements
and/or to arbitrate disputes connected with them.” 168

The Tribunal accepts that the Government was closely involved
in the negotiations of the agreements. The subject matter fell
within the domain of its prerogatives, and it had control over the
two entities. It also expressly approved the agreements.

However, the Government chose to implement the project
through agreements which it did not conclude itself. Instead, it
delegated the necessary powers to Petrobangla and BAPEX.
These entities, legally distinct from the Government, concluded

256.

the Agreements. Through this choice of the contracting parties
the Government clearly showed its intent not to be party to the
Agreements. The delegation has been expressed in a particularly
clear fashion in the preamble to the JVA, as quoted above.

Paragraph 14 of the Preamble is of particular importance both
for the question of jurisdiction and for the implementation of the
JVA. It demonstrates that the parties to the JVA were aware
that BAPEX was exercising functions vested in the Government
of which some had been delegated to Petrobangla. BAPEX gave
assurances that this was the case and the Government
approved the Agreement, including these assurances.

The Claimant was fully aware of this situation when it
concluded the agreements. Paragraph 14 of the Preamble
makes it quite clear that the Agreement is concluded with
BAPEX, as the assignee of the “responsibilities and obligations of
Petrobangla and the Government’, and not with the Government.
This gives meaning to BAPEX’s warranty that “it has acquired
from Petrobangla and the Government the requisite approvals to
execute this JVA”.

The JVA, as it was concluded, entitles the Claimant to rely on
the warranty of BAPEX, in particular with respect to the scope
of the obligations assumed by it. But it also prevents the
Claimant from disregarding the assignment of responsibilities
and obligations to BAPEX and from arguing that the true party
to the agreement is the Government and Petrobangla.

The Claimant accepted this structure of the agreements, just as
the Bangladeshi parties have accepted that the Canadian group
concluded the agreements through a subsidiary registered in
Barbados. The Tribunal has already held!® that, in the
absence of any abuse of this corporate structure, the
contracting parties are bound by their acceptance of the chosen
contracting partners. This goes for the Respondents with
respect to the Claimant’s company in Barbados; it also goes for
the choice of the contracting parties on the Bangladesh side.

The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to show
any intent of the Government of Bangladesh to be bound by the

'® See Section 4.

71

ICSID arbitration agreement; nor may any such intent be
implied in the circumstances. Bangladesh has not consented to
ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal, therefore, does not have
jurisdiction over the State of Bangladesh in the present case.
The People’s Republic of Bangladesh will no longer be a
Respondent in these proceedings.

JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO BAPEX AND
PETROBANGLA - THE ISSUE OF DESIGNATION

7.1 The issue and the Parties’ positions

Petrobangla is a named party to and has signed the GSPA;
BAPEX is a named party and has signed both the GSPA and the
JVA. The Respondents do not question that both have
consented in writing to arbitrate with Niko under the respective
agreements. Rather, the Respondents’ principal objection to
jurisdiction specific to BAPEX and Petrobangla concerns a
particular requirement under Article 25 the ICSID Convention
that relates to the capacity of BAPEX and Petrobangla to be
party to an ICSID arbitration.

On the side of the host State, jurisdiction of ICSID is limited by
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention to Contracting States and
to “any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State”.
However, the extension to subdivisions and agencies is qualified
by the words “designated to the Centre by that State”. Moreover,
Article 25(3) requires that the Contracting State must approve
the consent of such designated agencies or constituent
subdivisions in each case, unless the Contracting State has
notified the Centre that no such approval is necessary.

In the present case, the Respondents accept that the consent of
BAPEX and of Petrobangla to ICSID arbitration was approved by
Bangladesh, but argue that there was no designation. They
argue that four conditions must be met for a designation to
become effective: (i) there must be a written designation, (ii) it
must emanate from the State and specifically the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, (iii) there must be a clear intention to designate
and (iv) the designation must be sent to the Centre.!7° The
Respondents nevertheless concede that the document
containing the designation may be “physically sent by the state
or by someone else”.'71 According to the Respondents these
requirements were not met in the case at hand.

"HT 1, pp. 95-99.

"| HTL, p. 99. The passage continued as follows: “Then that could be the case where one of the two
parties to the agreement, to the contract, to the investment contract could send it to the Centre but it
must be a document from the State.”

73

260.

261.

262.

263.

The Claimant on its side accepts that designation is required
under Article 25(1), but submits that the Government’s approval
of the JVA and the GPSA “amount to the designation”.'7?
According to the Claimant, this designation may then be
communicated to the Centre by the filing of the request for
arbitration, as this was done in the present case by the two
RfAs. 173

The status of Petrobangla and BAPEX under the law of
Bangladesh has been discussed in the previous Section of this
Decision. Both are legal entities distinct from the Government,
but they are controlled by the Government and perform some
functions within domains reserved for the Government. In the
discussion about designation for the purposes of Article 25(1) of
the ICSID Convention their status as agencies of Bangladesh
has not given rise to serious controversy and is not contested by
the Respondents.

The Tribunal has considered the circumstances under which
the two agreements concluded by BAPEX and Petrobangla were
negotiated and executed. It noted that both agreements were
explicitly approved by the Government of Bangladesh in
writing.174 No exception was made in the approval which thus
extended to the arbitration clause. Since the Respondents have
not questioned that Bangladesh approved the consent to
arbitration by Petrobangla and BAPEX, the Tribunal has no
difficulty in accepting that the requirement of approval by the
State under Article 25(3) has indeed been complied with.

The requirement of Article 25 which remains controversial
specifically in relation to Petrobangla and BAPEX is that of their
designation as agencies of Bangladesh. The controversial issues
are (i) what is meant in Article 25(1) by “designated to the Centre
by that State”? and (ii) whether in the present case the
requirements have been met.

7.2 The requirement of designation

With respect to the first question, that concerning the meaning
of Designation in Article 25(1), it is necessary to consider, as a
matter of law, the proper construction to be placed on the
requirement of “designation”. This must be approached
applying the canons of treaty interpretation found in Articles 31
and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969,
175 namely (to paraphrase): natural and ordinary meaning,
object and purpose, context, and, where necessary to resolve an
ambiguity, reference to the preparatory documents.

7.2.1 The term “designation” _as__distinguished__ from
“notification”

The ordinary meaning of the term “designation”, as defined in
the Oxford English Dictionary, is: “the action of choosing
someone to hold an office or post’. Similarly, the Merriam
Webster Dictionary proposes as definition: “to indicate and set
apart for a specific purpose, office, or duty <designate a group to
prepare a plan>”.

The ICSID Convention uses the term “designation” on a number
of occasions to denote official actions undertaken by the
Contracting States vis-a-vis the Centre in relation to the treaty
rights and obligations of the States. Thus, Contracting States
may designate a representative to the Administrative Council;!7°
they may designate persons to the ICSID Panels of Arbitrators
and Conciliators under Articles 12 to 16; and they may also
designate courts or authorities competent for the enforcement of
arbitral awards under Article 54.

Thus, the critical element, so far as concerns the ordinary
meaning of the term and the use in the ICSID Convention, is the
action of choice or selection. The act of designating requires
both a subject and an object.

"5.1155 U.N.TS. 331.

6 According to Article 4 each governor and alternate governor of the Bank appointed by a Contracting
State shall be ex officio its representative and alternate representative, in the absence of a contrary
“designation”.

75

268.

269.

270.

271.

272.

Within Article 25(1), the subject is the Contracting State. The
object is its “constituent subdivision or agency”; since the two
entities considered here are agencies, this term will be used for
simplification when reference is made to the designation of
constituent subdivisions and agencies under Article 25(1).

The purpose for which the agency is chosen or selected, as
stated by Article 25(1), is to engage the jurisdiction of the Centre
in respect of a “legal dispute arising directly out of an investment

. which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to
the Centre”; or, more simply, to designate the agency as capable
of becoming itself a party to an ICSID arbitration.

The use of the expression “designate” in Article 25(1)
corresponds to that in Chapter I, Section 4, Articles 12 to 16.
These articles repeatedly use the expression “designate to” in
various forms, for instance “designate to each Panel’ or
“designated to a Panel’ (Article 13(1) and (2)) or “designate to
serve on the Panels” (Article (14(1)). In this context, it seems
clear that, “designate to” means choosing a person for the
function of serving on a Panel; it does not concern the
communication of this choice. Indeed, when Article 13(1), for
instance, provides that a “State may designate to each Panel four
persons ...”, what is meant obviously is not that the State makes
a communication to each Panel; it merely means that the
designated persons have been chosen by that State to appear on
the lists described as “Panel” and to serve in this function.

In Chapter I, Section 4 of the Convention, a different expression
is used for the act of communicating the State’s choice to ICSID.
Article 16(3) provides:

“All designations shall be notified to the Secretary-
General and shall take effect from the date on which the
notification is received.” (emphasis added)

Thus, a clear distinction is made in Chapter I, Section 4 of the
Convention between “designated” and “notified”. The first of
these terms concerns the choice of the person for a specific
function (Articles 12 to 16(2) deal with this choice); a different
term is then used with respect to the communication of this
choice in Article 16(3). The act of communicating the choice to

76

273.

274.

275.

276.

277.

the ICSID Secretary-General is not included in the term
“designation” as used in this Section.

The same distinction can be found in Article 54(2) which
provides:

“Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General
of the designation of the competent court or other
authority ...” (emphasis added)

Here, too, two different terms are used and indicate a clear
distinction between the designation of a court or authority, i.e.
the choice for a certain function, and the communication of this
choice to the Centre by way of a notification.

The terms “notify” and “notification” appear at a number of
other places in the Convention, describing a formal act of
communication. Indeed, the term appears at several occasions
in Article 25. Thus, when a Contracting State intends to
dispense with the requirement of having to approve the consent
of a constituent subdivision or agency, it “notifies the Centre”
that no such approval is required. Similarly, if a Contracting
State wishes to make known that it would or would not consider
submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre a class or classes of
disputes, it may “notify” this position to the Centre and the
Secretary-General transmits such “notification” to all
Contracting States (Article 25(4)).

With respect to agencies, Article 25(1) uses the term designation
but does not mention notification. If the term designation is
understood as being distinct from notification, the question
arises whether notification or any other form of communication
to the Centre is required, a question that shall be addressed
later in this section.

7.2.2 The purposes of designation under Article 25(1)

 

When the concept of designation first arose during the
preparation of the ICSID Convention, it was related to the idea
of informing investors about the entities on the side of the State
with which they could contract. The idea was first introduced
by a proposal of the representative for the United Kingdom at

77

the Legal Committee Proceedings, 25 November 1964. The
proposal contained the following passage:

“«

. each State party to the Convention could deposit a list
indicating the bodies regarded by it as ‘political
subdivisions’ for the purposes of this Convention.” 177

278. Summarising the discussions that led to the inclusion of the
designation requirement, Schreuer explains:

“The primary purpose of the requirement to designate
entities that might become parties in ICSID proceedings to
the Centre is to give an investor an assurance that he or
she is dealing with an authorized entity. In other words,
investors are given advance notice of with whom they may
deal.” 178

279. While information to potential investors may be a _ useful
objective for publicising the identity of designated agencies, in
the view of this Tribunal, this objective can hardly justify a
requirement of designation as it is provided by Article 25(1).
Assurance of “dealing with an authorised entity” and “advance
notice” may well be obtained by other means and it is difficult to
see what interest investors could have in the restriction on
eligibility of an agency by the requirement of designation.

280. The text of Article 25(1) suggests that the principal purpose of
designation in the context of that article is a different one:
designation enables the agency to become party to “a legal
dispute [...| which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to
submit to the Centre”, i.e., to become party to an ICSID
arbitration proceeding. In the list of “Designations by
Contracting States Regarding Constituent Subdivisions and

"8 Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 248; in the same context Schreuer also mentions a possible
“secondary purpose”; but immediately discards it as not very plausible: “A secondary purpose of
designation may be a desire on the part of the State to preserve control over semi-autonomous entities
in their dealings with foreign investors. But this purpose is more readily achieved by withholding
approval of consent to jurisdiction under Art. 25(3) ..

Agencies”, published by ICSID (the List of Designations),!7° it
is stated that the subdivisions and agencies have been
designated “as competent to become parties to disputes
submitted to the Centre”. In the Tribunal’s understanding it is
this “competence” (one may also use the term “capacity”) which
is created by the designation.

The Convention is concluded by States, acting as subjects of
international law. It provides for arbitration of certain types of
disputes between these Contracting States and nationals of
other Contracting States. Constituent subdivisions and
agencies of these States normally are not subjects of
international law and thus are not “competent” to conclude, on
the side of the host State, arbitration agreements containing an
ICSID dispute settlement clause and become party to an ICSID
arbitration. It was therefore necessary for the Convention to
provide expressly for the possibility that constituent
subdivisions and agencies, as entities existing under domestic
law, could acquire such competence or capacity to become party
to ICSID arbitration proceedings.

Designation of an agency thus has as a very important
consequence that the distinct legal personality of the agency
under domestic law is recognised at the level of ICSID.

By creating in favour of an agency of domestic law a distinct
capacity at the level of the Convention, designation has the
advantage for the State of limiting its legal and financial
exposure with respect to contracts concluded by the agency.
The distinct legal personality of the agency thus is recognised in
a similar manner (and with similar limitations) as the
recognition of a distinct legal personality of a corporation on the
investor’s side. 18°

7.2.3 Types of designation - General and ad hoc designation

Article 25(1) does not prescribe how a designation, i.e., a
designating act, must be made. In particular it does not specify
whether designation must occur specifically for each arbitration
agreement concluded by an agency on an ad hoc basis, or
whether it can be made generally for certain categories of
projects or for all agreements concluded by the agency in
question.

The matter was addressed during the preparations of the
Convention. The question was raised whether designations
should be made for a particular purpose or in general. Mr Aron
Broches responded that this should be left to the State
concerned.!8! This can be taken as an indication that the lack
of determination in Article 25(1) is intentional. It is left to the
State whether it wishes to designate an agency for a specific
investment or generally.

This conclusion is confirmed by the practice of States to the
extent to which this practice is known. Some information about
this practice is provided by the Secretariat of ICSID. On its List
of Designations one finds both territorial subdivisions of the
designating States and State corporations such as national
petroleum corporations, utilities, mining corporations, etc.

The entities on the List of Designations all seem to have been
designated in a general manner for an unlimited number of
agreements. However, the List of Designations concludes by a
Note indicating:

“Ad hoc designation and notification made by Contracting
States pursuant to Article 25(1) and 25(3) are excluded
from this listing.”

One must conclude that there are cases in which States indeed
choose to proceed not by general designation but in an ad hoc
manner, designating an agency for a specific project or in an
otherwise limited manner, such as a particular dispute or a
particular contract.

'8! History of the ICSID Convention, vol. II, p. 857.

80

289. The List of Designations does not indicate that any reservations
were made against the practice of ad hoc designations
mentioned in the list; nor is there any other indication that this
practice has given rise to any objections or expression of doubt.
Schreuer confirms - and supports by examples - that it is “open
to states to make designations not only in general terms but also
on the occasion of specific investment projects”.'82_ He adds that
“it is entirely possible for the designation to be made after
consent is given or even after a dispute has arisen”; but it must
occur before proceedings are instituted. 183

290. The Tribunal concludes that ad hoc designations, limited to a
specific investment and the corresponding arbitration
agreement, meet the requirements of Article 25(1).

291. This conclusion leads to another: By their very nature and as
shown by the absence of their publication in the List of
Designations, ad hoc designations are not given general
publicity which, as mentioned above, is considered by some as
one of the purposes of designation.!84. Since ad hoc
designations are accepted as a valid form of designation, one
must conclude that the publicity objective may be useful, but is
not a necessary feature of designation.

7.2.4 The form of designation and the question of implicit
designation

292. Article 25(1) does not specifically prescribe any requirement of
form which a State must observe when designating an agency in
the sense understood here. As is the case with respect to the
choice between general and ad hoc designation, the choice of
the form is left to the State concerned.

'® Schreuer, paragraph 255 at Article 25.

‘83 Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 258. At Article 25, paragraphs 260-261, Schreuer qualifies this
statement by referring to the Kléckner v. Cameroon case where, under unusual circumstances after the
commencement of the arbitration, Cameroon designated an entity which originally had been under the
control of the investor but, during the course of the arbitration, became a constituent subdivision of
Cameroon and was then designated as such.

'S ‘This is not to say, however, that ad hoc designations are not accessible to the public. The ICSID
website reveals that ad hoc designations are accessible upon request to the ICSID Secretariat. See the
ICSID website (www.worldbank.org/icsid). In the “Members States” section under the sub-navigation
menu “Search Membership”, there are hyperlinks for each State, and under these, the following
statement is found under the tab entitled “Designations and Notifications “For information of any ad
hoc designation or notification made by this Contracting State pursuant to Article 25(1) and (3) of the
Convention, please contact the Secretariat.” .

81

297.

185

This question of the form of the designation is distinct from that
about who can make a designation. In this respect there is little
doubt possible and apparently no controversy: the designation
in the sense of the designating act has to be made by the
relevant Contracting State.

Concerning the form in which the designation is made, there
seems to be little information available about the manner which
States adopt for the act of designation. ICSID’s List of
Designations indicates the date of the designation but does not
provide any indication about the form which it took.

It is not inconceivable that a State may designate an agency at
the time of its creation, as part of the powers conferred upon it
by the State. Thus, when an agency is granted the powers to
conclude investment agreements, the designation to enter into
ICSID arbitration agreements might be included in these
powers. Schreuer refers to a law in Sri Lanka as an example of
such designation by legislation. Schreuer also mentions the
possibility of including a general designation of an agency in a
bilateral investment treaty. 185

Other forms of designation may be found. The choice may differ
in cases of general and ad hoc designations. Such other forms
may include informal methods, since Article 25(1), as just
explained, does not prescribe any particular formality for the
designating act.

Some confirmation for the absence of strict requirements of
form may be found in the Institution Rules 2(1)(b) and (c) which
require that a request for arbitration shall

“(b) state, if one of the parties is a constituent subdivision
or agency of a Contracting State, that it has been
designated to the Centre by that State pursuant to Article
25(1) of the Convention;

(c) indicate the date of consent and the instrument in which
it is recorded, including, if one party is a constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State, similar data

82

299.

300.

301.

on the approval of such consent by that State unless it had
notified the Centre that no such approval is requested.”

This Tribunal is aware that this Rule concerns simply the
requirements which must be met so that the Centre registers a
request for arbitration. The Rule does not regulate the criteria
which must be applied by an arbitral tribunal to which the case
will be referred to establish its own jurisdiction. It is
nevertheless significant to note the difference, at the stage of the
commencement of the arbitration, in the treatment between
designation and consent. With respect to consent by an agency,
the request for arbitration must identify both the specific
instrument in which consent is recorded and the instrument
which records the State’s approval. With respect to designation,
the requirements are simpler: it is sufficient that the request for
arbitration state that designation occurred; no_ specific
instrument recording designation is required.

The absence of a prescribed form for designation must have a
further consequence: since neither Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention nor the Institution Rules, nor any other text
governing the requirement of designation prescribes a specific
form for designation, implicit designation must be possible.
Such implicit designation may be accepted when the intention
to designate clearly appears under the circumstances and is not
contradicted by other indications.

Since, as mentioned above, designations are made by the
Contracting States, it is the conduct of the State which is
relevant and not that of the agency which is designated. As
pointed out by Schreuer, “the entity concerned cannot designate
itself” .186

In the view of the present Tribunal, a particularly strong case of
implicit designation occurs when the State expressly and
formally approves in writing that one of its agencies enters into
an investment agreement containing an ICSID clause. Since
designation has as its purpose and objective to confer on the
agency the competence or capacity to become party to an ICSID
arbitration, the approval by the State of an ICSID arbitration
commitment by one of its agencies presupposes that this agency

'86 Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252.

83

302.

303.

304.

305.

has the capacity to conclude such a commitment, which means
that it must be capable to be a party to an ICSID arbitration.

If the State has not already conferred this capacity on the
agency by an earlier (general) designation, the approval
necessarily must include the intention to confer this capacity on
the agency by an ad hoc designation. Assuming the contrary
would mean that the State, when granting its approval of the
agency’s consent, intended to leave this approval without effect.
It would require very strong evidence to establish that a State
intended to act in such contradictory fashion. Even then, it is
doubtful that such a contrary intention should be given effect in
view of the overriding principle requiring good faith conduct.

7.2.5 Communicating the State’s designation to the Centre

Designations, as stated in the ICSID List of Designations, render
agencies “competent to become parties to disputes submitted to
the Centre”. Such competence is exercised in the course of
specific proceedings, when a request for arbitration is submitted
to the Centre and the agency appears before an arbitral
tribunal. In order to be effective, the competence must be
known by the Centre before it is exercised. This competence
therefore must be made known to the Centre.

When the designation is notified by a Contracting State by way
of an official communication to the Centre and entered on the
List of Designations, the issue is not problematic. These
designations demonstrably have been communicated to the
Centre and entry on the List is a record that such
communication occurred. However, entry on the List of
Designations is not a requirement under Article 25(1). The
question therefore is whether and under what circumstances an
arbitral tribunal may find that a designation was validly brought
to the Centre’s attention in a form different from official
communication.

It seems that in some cases “general notoriety” of the
designation was considered as an admissible form of
communication. Thus Schreuer wrote that designation “can
take any form that gives it general notoriety and comes to the

84

306.

307.

308.

Centre’s attention”.187 That sentence suggests that the
designation requirement of Article 25(1) would be met for
instance by (1) an enactment of a Contracting State which
confers on a national agency power to conclude investment
agreements including ICSID arbitration clauses, provided that
(2) the enactment has “general notoriety”, for instance by
publication in the official gazette of that State, and (3) that as
part of investment legislation of a Contracting State this
publication may be assumed to have come to the Centre’s
attention.

An example of “public notoriety” was given in the case of
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company v. Arab Republic of Egypt
General Authority for Investment and Free Zones.'88& The
tribunal held that the designation was contained in an
investment law (Law No. 43). Its publication conferred “public
notoriety” to the designation and thus brought the designation
to the Centre’s attention. 189

Given the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal need
not decide whether “public notoriety” is an adequate or
admissible form of “communication”. What is relevant here is
that the views expressed in this context require that the
designation must come “to the Centre’s attention”.

The question has been examined in some detail by
Chittharanjan Felix Amerasinghe, a well-known international
lawyer who during his three decades of employment at the
World Bank was involved in the early development of ICSID. In
an article that appeared in 1979 he clearly distinguished
between designation and communication and, when considering
the words “designated to the Centre”, explained that:

“Normally, this would mean that there should be some kind
of formal communication of the designation to the
Centre.” 190

'87 Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252.

188

ICSID Case No. ARB/89/1, Order Noting Discontinuance of 24 June 1993 (Seidl-Hohenveldern,

Abdel A’al and Bucher).
'® For the concept of “public notoriety” in the Cambodia Power case, see below.

190 A merasinghe, “The Jurisdiction of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes”, 19 Indian Journal of International Law 166, 188 (1979) (hereinafter Amerasinghe).

85

309.

After considering some situation which in his view did not meet
the requirement of Article 25(1) he continued:

“On the other hand, it is a moot question whether there
must always be an official communication of the
designation to the Centre. It is arguable that where there
was a clear intention on the part of the Contracting State to
file the designation with the Centre at the time the
designation was made but the actual communication is not
made by that State to the Centre, it is adequate if instead
of there being a formal communication of the designation to
the Centre by the State it is brought to the attention of the
Centre in some way whether by the State concerned or by
one of the parties to the consent agreement provided this is
done before the initial intention is changed.” 19!

310. As a foundation for his conclusion, Amerasinghe notably

311.

referred to the drafting history of the Convention. He remarked
that early drafts had proposed the grant of locus standi to
political subdivisions or agencies of a State without a
requirement of designation by that State. Exploring why that
had not been thought sufficient, he noted that delegates had
perceived that a designation would be useful to avoid “disputes
as to whether an entity was a ‘political subdivision” and that it
was “difficult to see how a party that was not a Contracting State
could be included in the jurisdiction of the Centre” by leaving it to
the Centre, or to arbitrators, to decide the matter in the absence
of a confirmation by the State. He also referred to the comment
that States could “avoid the risk of consent by a political
subdivision” by requiring designation. !92

When concluding that “formal communication” could be
replaced by some other way in which designation can be
brought to the attention of the Centre, Amerasinghe assumes
the predicate of “a clear intention on the part of the Contracting
State to file the designation”.'%° It is a question of fact which
shall be considered below whether, in the circumstances of the
present case such a clear intention is found to have existed.
When determining whether such an intention existed, the
conduct of the State must be considered and interpreted in good
faith. As explained above, such an intention cannot be denied
by the State in a case when it proposes and approves the

191 A merasinghe, p. 188.
> Amerasinghe, p. 187.
'3 A merasinghe, p. 188.

86

conclusion of an ICSID arbitration clause by its agencies. Such
proposal and approval by the State can be understood only in
the sense that the State ensures to the investor that, on its side,
there are no obstacles to the effectiveness of the arbitration
agreement.

312. These explanations by Amerasinghe have been referred to by
Schreuer who wrote:

“The notification of an agreement with the investor
containing the designation is enough. It has been argued
that where there is a clear intention to designate, it does
not matter how and through whom the communication
reaches the Centre.” 194

313. Schreuer does not seem to disagree with this position. In the
quoted passage he seems to take the view that designation can
take any form but must come “to the Centre’s attention”.195

314. Amerasinghe’s view has been confirmed by the arbitral tribunal
in the East Kalimantan case. Relying on the quoted passage in
Schreuer’s book, the tribunal there found:

“The form and channel of communication do not matter,
provided that the intention to designate is clearly
established.

]

Consequently, the designation requirement may in
particular be deemed fulfilled when a document that
emanates from the State is filed with the request for
arbitration and shows that State’s intent to name a specific
entity as a constituent subdivision of agency for the
purposes of Article 25(1).”19°

 

'4 Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252.

'®5 Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 252; the reference to the position of Amerasinghe is immediately
followed by a reference to the view of Broches who stated that designation could be dispensed with if it
is proven that the entity is an agency or constituent subdivision of the State. When Schreuer adds that
it “seems that this goes too far”, he obviously means the opinion of Broches and not that of
Amerasinghe.

'°6 Government of the Province of East Kalimantan v. PT Kaltim Prima Coal, Rio Tinto PLC and
others, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/3 (Kaufmann-Kohler, Hwang, van den Berg), Award of 28 December
2009 (hereinafter East Kalimantan Award), paragraphs 192-193.

 

87

315. The opinion expressed by Amerasinghe and shared by the East
Kalimantan tribunal also has implications for the second of the
two aspects that must be considered here: who must
communicate the designation to the Centre?

316. The relevant passage of Article 25(1) reads “designated to the
Centre by that State”. It is clear that the agency must be
designated “by the State”. It is also clear that the designation
must get “to the Centre”. However, given the distinction
operated by the Convention between “designated” and “notified”
and the manner in which the term “notified” is used in Article
25 and elsewhere in the Convention,!9” it cannot be assumed
that, in Article 25(1) the word “designated” includes the word
“notified” while in Article 4 and in Article 54 designation and
notification are two distinct acts.

317. One must conclude that the words “designated to the Centre” do
not prescribe the method of implementation, i.e. the manner in
which the designation is communicated to the Centre and in
particular by whom this is done.

318. In other words, the intervention of the State is required for the
designation but is not necessarily required for the
communication to the Centre. Understood in this sense, the
designation requirement in Article 25(1) is complied with if the
agency in question is “designated by the State and such
designation is communicated to the Centre”. This conclusion is
in line with the text of the provision and with the authors and
cases which have been brought to the attention of the
Tribunal!98 and to which reference has been made above.

319. In case of Cambodia Power Company and Kingdom of Cambodia
and Electricité du Cambodge the tribunal reached a different
conclusion. That tribunal first expressed the view that
“designation cannot be dispensed with altogether’ and that

*7 See above Section 7.2.1.

'8 Schreuer at Article 25, at paragraph 252, records the argument that “it does not matter how and
through whom the communication reaches the Centre’. This is in line with the conclusion reached by
this Tribunal. However, Schreuer adds later in the same paragraph that “[t]here must be some
communication by the host-State to the Centre,” which would seem to indicate that it must be through
the host State that the communication must reach the Centi f that were the view of the distinguished
author, the Tribunal would not share it insofar as it requires that the communication must be made
through the host State.

 

   

88

320.

321.

322.

“there must be some form of communication’.199 In so doing, it
did not part company with the tribunal in East Kalimantan, or
indeed with the present arbitrators.

However, the Cambodia Power tribunal set a very high standard
for this communication. It declared that “a structured and
standardised system of notification is obviously necessary”.20°
Communication must be in the written form and must either be
made through a direct and formal communication by the State
to the Centre or achieve “public notoriety”. The Cambodia
Power tribunal then concluded that “public notoriety of a
designation cannot be achieved through the Claimant’s
communication to the Centre of a private investment contract
annexed to the Request for Arbitration”.2!

When considering this case, one should bear in mind that the
Cambodia Power tribunal was seized of this issue on materially
different facts to the present case. At the time when the
relevant contracts were concluded, the Kingdom of Cambodia
was not a party to the ICSID Convention. The Cambodia Power
tribunal therefore concluded that commitments concerning
designation made prior to Cambodia’s adhesion to the
Convention did not meet the requirement of Article 25(1).

The Cambodia Power tribunal reached the conclusion that the
communication of a designation must be made by the State on
the ground that (i) Article 25(1) refers to designated “by that
State”, (ii) that “it is obviously essential that communications be
the sole preserve of the State itself and not a function which
investors can discharge” and (iii) that the designation serves a
“gate-keeping’? function that allows the Contracting State to
control any given agency’s dealings with foreign investors.2°2 In
that sense, the Cambodia tribunal expanded the understanding
of “designation” in Article 25(1) by declaring that
“communication is inherent in the very notion of ‘designation’
used’ in Article 25(1).2°3

Cambodia Power Decision, paragraphs 249, 250.

?°3 Cambodia Power Decision, paragraph 225.

89

323.

324.

For the reasons discussed above, this Tribunal understands the
meaning of Article 25(1) to be different. It considers that the
Cambodia Power tribunal’s analysis elides two concepts, each of
which is a separate element of Article 25(1): the State’s act of
designation and the communication of that act to the Centre.
This Tribunal considers the two steps separately: designation,
for this Tribunal, as for the Cambodia Power tribunal, is “the
sole preserve of the State itself’; but this Tribunal takes a more
nuanced position with respect to the communication of
designation to the Centre where in case of ad hoc designation
other forms of communication are not necessarily excluded.
The Cambodia Power tribunal itself, elsewhere in its decision,
accepts that “formal notification to the Centre” is not necessarily
“the only means by which a designation might be brought to the
Centre’s attention”; it also accepts “the use of other channels of
communication” and mentions specifically that designation may
be “given public notoriety by the Contracting State such as to
come to the Centre’s attention” .2°+

The present Tribunal has explained that it need not decide
whether “public notoriety” is an adequate or admissible method
of communication for the purpose of Article 25(1), ensuring that
a designation in a particular case will effectively come to the
Centre’s attention.2°5 It simply notes that, even for the
Cambodia Power tribunal “other channels of communication”
are admissible which do not necessarily amount to a “structured
and standardised system of notification”. Moreover, this
Tribunal does not agree that the requirement of designation has
the “gate-keeping” function which the Cambodia Power tribunal
attributes to it and which, in that tribunal’s view, justifies a
requirement that the communication must come from the State.
As explained above, such gate-keeping is achieved
straightforwardly by the approval of the agency’s consent
pursuant to Article 25(3).20¢

7.2.6 Conclusions concerning the requirement of “designation”
under Article 25(1

Designation, as required under Article 25(1), refers to an act by
a Contracting State by which the State confers upon the agency
the capacity to conclude a valid ICSID arbitration agreement
and become a party to an ICSID arbitration. Designation may
be expressed by the State in a general form or specifically for a
particular project or dispute.

Article 25(1) does not prescribe a particular form for the
designating act. In particular in the context of ad hoc
designations, these may be expressed implicitly, for example by
the State’s approval of the conclusion by the agency of an ICSID
arbitration agreement.

The requirement in Article 25(1) of designation “by the State”
does not necessarily apply to the manner in which designation
is made known “to the Centre”. Article 25(1) does not prescribe
any form for this communication. Therefore, an arbitral
tribunal may give effect to an existing ad hoc designation which
may be made known to ICSID by an investor when filing a
Request for Arbitration by a statement pertaining to a specific
dispute, particular facts, and in accordance with Institution
Rule 2.

In particular, if an ad hoc designation is expressed implicitly in
the form of the State’s approval of the ICSID arbitration
agreement concluded by the agency, communication may take
place by bringing this approval to the attention of the Centre
with the Request for Arbitration in the form in which it was
expressed.

This understanding of the designation requirement ensures that
the principal objective, that of conferring limited international
capacity on a particular agency, is met. It permits the State to
use designation for purposes of public notification, if it so
desires, but it does not require that this be done. The objective
of protecting the State against poorly considered commitments
by agencies is achieved above all by the requirement of approval
according to Article 25(3).

7.3 Designation in the present case

In RfA I, under the heading “Designation of parties who are a
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contacting State”, the
Claimant stated that “Bangladesh has designated Petrobangla
and BAPEX for purposes of the Article 25 of the Convention as a
result of the making and execution of the Joint Venture
Agreement made and entered into on October 16, 2003”.2°” In
the course of the demonstration which follows this statement,
the Claimant added:

“(e) By directing and authorising Bapex to execute the JVA,
containing consent to arbitrate under the Convention,
Bangaldesh has designated Bapex and Petrobangla to the
Centre pursuant to Article 25 of the Convention;”208

The same statement appears in RfA II.209

The directions on which the Claimant relies have been quoted
above.?2!0 With respect to the JVA, these directions were
contained in the letter of 11 October 2003 which communicated
to Petrobangla, with copy to BAPEX, the approval of the Prime
Minister.2!1 This approval was communicated to Niko in the
form of BAPEX letter of 13 October 2003 stating:

“In accordance with the approval accorded by the
Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to sign
the “JOINT VENTURE AGREEMENT FOR’ THE
DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM FROM
THE MARGINAL/ABANDONED CHATTAC & FENI GAS
FIELDS” between Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration &
Production Company Ltd (BAPEX) and Niko Resources
(Bangladesh) Ltd, you are requested to send your
Authorised representative with due authorisation to sign
the said contract on 16 October, 2003 at 12.00 Noon to
the Register office of BAPEX, Dhaka, Bangladesh.”?!2

The GPSA was approved by the Government, acting through the
Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, Energy and
Mineral Division, Development Section-3. On 20 December 2006
it addressed a letter to the Chairman of Petrobangla in the
following terms:

“You are informed on the above subject and reference that
the draft Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA) for the
produced gas from the Feni Gas Field as per agreement of
Bapex with NAICO [sic] sent through abovementioned
memo under reference has been approved by the
government.

2. Under the circumstances the undersigned is directed to
request you to take necessary action in the due pursuance
of the existing rules and regulations on the above
mentioned subject.”2!

On the following day, 21 December 2006, Petrobangla wrote to
Niko and BAPEX and, referring to the letter of the Government
just mentioned, informed them that the Government had
approved the GPSA.2!4

Bangladesh has not only approved the consent of the two
agencies and indeed directed the execution of the agreements,
but was also directly involved in the introduction of the
arbitration clause in the Agreements: on the basis of the
evidence produced with respect to the negotiations of the
agreements, the Tribunal concluded that the arbitration clause
was introduced by Petrobangla and BAPEX;2!5 given the close
control of the Government over the negotiations of the
agreements, the introduction of the ICSID arbitration clause
was intended if not initiated by the State.

The situation is even clearer in the case of the GPSA. Based on
the testimony at the hearing the Tribunal concludes that the
arbitration clause was introduced by Petrobangla with the
approval, if not at the instruction, of the Government.?!©

The Respondents have explained that designation in
Bangladesh must be made by the “competent authority” adding
that, “in this case it would be the Ministry, in the case of
Bangladesh, in accordance with the rules of business in
Bangladesh. It would have to be the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs” 217 Later in the argument at the hearing, the
Respondents referred to the extract of these Rules of Business
produced in the arbitration. These rules allocate functions
among different parts of the Government.?!8

The extract of the Rules of Business that has been produced
concerns the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. It
shows that this ministry deals with “all policies and matters
relating to Petroleum, Natural Gas and Mineral Resources”; the
functions of the energy division specifically include “Liaison with
international organisations and matters relating to treaties and
agreements”; matters relating to Petrobangla are specifically
mentioned. One must conclude that designation with respect to
Article 25(1) is a function of this Ministry.

The State of Bangladesh established Petrobangla and BAPEX by
legislation and executive decision as the agencies responsible
for contracting with investors for the exploitation of gas fields in
Bangladesh. With respect to the JVA this has been presented in
particular detail in the Preamble of this agreement which
contains the following passages:

“Petrobangla has the power to exercise rights and powers
of the Government [...] and also to enter into Petroleum
Agreements with any person/company for the purpose of
any Petroleum Operations.”?19

“BAPEX warrants that it has acquired from Petrobangla
and the Government the requisite approvals to execute this
JUVA ...”,220

When considering above the interpretation of Article 25(1), the
Tribunal concluded that, in the absence of clear evidence to the
contrary, the approval by the State of the consent by one of its

agencies to an ICSID arbitration clause necessarily implies that
this agency has been granted capacity to conclude such an
arbitration clause and to become a party to an ICSID
arbitration, i.e. that it has been designated for that purpose.

While it cannot exclude that Petrobangla and BAPEX might
have been designated at some earlier time by a separate act or
in the context of some other agreement, the Tribunal concludes
that, in the circumstances of the present case, designation
occurred at the latest when the Government approved the
consent of the agencies to arbitration under the JVA and the
GPSA. There is no indication that the Government of
Bangladesh, during the negotiations or at any time prior to the
conclusion of the agreements or prior to the commencement of
these arbitrations, objected to the designation of these two
agencies or to their consent to ICSID arbitration.

In this respect, there is a fundamental difference between the
present case and the facts in East Kalimantan, where the
tribunal found that the evidence relied upon by the claimant
was insufficient to demonstrate the State’s intent to
designate,22!_ and where the Government of Indonesia had
clearly denied any authorisation to East Kalimantan and firmly
stated that this provincial administration had “no
capacity/qualification/authority and legal standing’ to file a
claim in ICSID.222

Similarly, in the case of Cable TV of Nevis v. St Kitts and Nevis,
the arbitral tribunal found that not only was there no
designation but also no approval by the State.225

In the present case, the agreements concluded by Petrobangla
and BAPEX which contained the ICSID clause were expressly
approved by the Government and the letters by which Niko was
informed of the approval by the Government were submitted to
the Centre with the Requests for Arbitration.

On the basis of the evidence before it and for the above reasons,
the Tribunal is satisfied that, by authorising BAPEX and

Petrobangla to conclude the agreements containing the ICSID
arbitration clauses, in terms previously proposed by the
Bangladeshi agencies, the State of Bangladesh not only
approved consent to ICSID arbitration by these two agencies in
terms of Article 25(3) but also designated, implicitly but
necessarily, BAPEX and Petrobangla as agencies in the sense of
Article 25(1), if such designation had not occurred earlier. The
designation was communicated to the Centre by the Claimant’s
Requests for Arbitration. The Respondents’ objection relying on
an alleged failure of Bangladesh to designate BAPEX and
Petrobangla must therefore be dismissed.

The Tribunal adds that, if it had not concluded that the
requirement of designation had been complied with in the
present case, it would have had to consider whether the
Respondents’ objection based on the asserted absence of
designation could have been reconciled with the overriding
obligation of good faith conduct of the Parties. When a State
chooses a mode of execution where the conclusion of the
investment agreement is delegated to an agency and, upon
proposal of the State, that agreement provides for ICSID
arbitration, the investor may be entitled to expect that the State
takes the steps prescribed by Article 25(1) to give effect to the
agreement. For the State to rely on its failure to take these
steps with the objective of preventing the effectiveness of the
arbitration clause may be contrary to good faith.

However, since the Tribunal concluded that Bangladesh did
designate BAPEX and Petrobangla in a manner which complied
with the requirement of Article 25(1), the Tribunal need not
consider this question any further.

On the basis of these considerations the Tribunal finds that
BAPEX and Petrobangla, the Second and Third Respondent,
have validly consented to ICSID arbitration and are bound by
the arbitration clauses in the agreements to which they are

party.

THE DISPUTE ARISING DIRECTLY OUT OF AN INVESTMENT

The Convention restricts jurisdiction of the Centre to legal
disputes “arising directly out of an investment’. The Respondents
deny that this requirement has been met.

The project to which this dispute relates concerns several
marginal or abandoned gas fields which were to be evaluated
and, if found promising, to be developed for production. The
work required the commitment of financial and other resources
for a long period of time at the risk of no recovery. The
circumstances, and in particular the potential contribution to
Bangladesh’s energy supply as well as the engagement of the
Government of Bangladesh, indicate that the project had
significance for the development of the country.

With respect to the JVA, the Claimant explained in RfA I that,
by the time the Request was filed, its total “capital/investment
pursuant to the JVA” was approximately US$147 million,22+ an
amount that has not been contested by the Respondents in this
arbitration. The JVA made it quite clear that Niko had to
provide the funding of the operation, the profits were to be
shared between BAPEX and Niko, and the losses had to be
assumed by Niko which bore the full risk of the operation.
Articles 2.3, 2.4 and 2.6 of the JVA are particularly relevant in
this respect:

“2.3. BAPEX shall not be required to fund the Joint
Venture operations.

2.4 All capital/Investment including operating expenses
shall be provided by [Niko] and BAPEX shall not have to
make any investment. The revenue derived from petroleum
produced and sold under this JVA shall be distributed on
the basis of the Investment Multiple (IM) achieved as
provided for in Articles 23.3 under JVA.

[I

4 REA I, paragraph 6.22.

97

2.6 If there is no Commercial Production in the JVA Area
or if the production achieved from the JVA Area developed
by [Niko] is insufficient to recover [Niko’s] investment,
[Niko] shall bear all its losses.”

352. It is readily apparent that the project meets the criteria which
normally are identified as constitutive of an investment, as they
have been discussed by learned writers and arbitral
tribunals.225 Since this Tribunal concludes that the criteria are
met, it does not need to address the controversy whether these
criteria must be treated as “jurisdictional requirements”.””°

353. Indeed, the Respondents accept that Niko made an investment
in Bangladesh. They stated:

“With respect to the first alleged investment, Niko
Bangladesh no doubt had an investment in the
hydrocarbon sector of Bangladesh. The Joint Venture with
BAPEX may constitute a qualifying investment under the
ICSID Convention.”227

354. Consequently, Niko’s activities pursuant to the JVA qualify as
an investment. A dispute concerning Niko’s rights and
obligations under this agreement is therefore a “legal dispute
arising directly out of an investment’.

355. The difference between the Parties in this respect essentially
concerns the GSPA. While accepting that the JVA relates to an
investment, the Respondents contest that the GPSA “qualifies as
an autonomous investment in Bangladesh”. According to the
Respondents:

“The contract must be an investment contract. Each

contract must qualify as an investment contract in order to
5 Schreuer at Article 25, paragraph 158, concludes from his study of legal writers and arbitral awards
that four criteria are most frequently relied upon when determining whether an operation may be
characterised as investment: “a (substantial) contribution, a certain duration of the operation, ri

 

and

 

contribution to the host State’s operation”. These criteria, often referred to as the “Salini criteria” have
been applied recently also by an arbitral tribunal in a case to which Bangladesh was a party. In the
Chevron case referred to above the tribunal referred to the “criteria identified by the Salini Tribunal”
and on that basis determined whether the Claimants had made an investment in the sense of Article

25(1).

fulfil the requirements of the phrase in Article 25.1 that
says a claim arising directly out of an investment.”2?8

According to the Respondents, the Joint Venture Partners as
the Sellers contracted “to sell and deliver Gas to the Buyer’.
They argue that neither the sale of gas nor the potential
expenditures that the Claimant may have incurred in carrying
out the commercial transaction and for delivering the gas can be
construed as an “investment”.229

The Claimant responds by arguing that “the GPSA was part of
the investment’; it “was the mechanism by which the parties
fulfilled their commitments and expectations under Art. 24 of the
JVA to sell the production and recoup the investment’ .2°°

The Tribunal notes first of all that, contrary to what the
Respondents argue, the GPSA is not just a “sales contract’.?5! It
is not limited to the simple sale of a defined quantity of gas
against an agreed price. It is a long term agreement, in
principle for a period of five years. It may be terminated earlier
in case of depletion of the Feni field and it may be prolonged by
mutual agreement.252 The Sellers guarantee to sell a minimum
quantity and the Buyer guarantees to purchase an annual
minimum quantity.2°3 Ultimately the quantities delivered and
purchased depend on the “final deliverability of the Feni gas
field’ .234

In order to perform this long term delivery contract, the Sellers
(and specifically Niko as one of the Joint Venture Partners) had
to make substantial expenditures, at the risk of not fully
recovering it in case of insufficient “deliverability” of the Feni
field. Obviously, the gas delivered made a contribution to the
economy of Bangladesh. Thus the GPSA, taken alone, may
qualify as an investment agreement and disputes arising out of
it meet the requirement of Article 25(1).

The question whether the transaction regulated by the GPSA,
taken in isolation, would qualify as an investment as required
by the Convention need not, however, be finally decided here
since the Respondents’ objection must be rejected on more
general grounds:

Contrary to the Respondents’ argument, Article 25(1) does not
require that the dispute arise out of “an investment contract” but
“out of an investment’. An investment is an economic operation
and contracts regulate the rights and obligations relating to this
operation. Investments of any complexity often consist of a
variety of different components. These components may be
regulated in a single legal instrument or in separate contracts.

In the case of an operation like the one considered here, it may
well be possible to settle the rights and obligations of the
investor in relation to the natural resource in question in a
single legal instrument. The investor’s undertakings to develop
and deliver products, and its remuneration therefore, all form
part of the investment; disputes with respect to them must be
deemed to arise “directly out of the investment’.

For these reasons, the Tribunal sees no justification for
distinguishing, in the context of the characterisation as
investment dispute, between those investments where the entire
project is subject to a single instrument and those where
different aspects of the project are regulated by separate
contracts.

It is indeed now widely accepted that an investment must be
seen as a coherent unit, even if it is implemented through a
number of different projects. In the very first ICSID arbitration
the concept of “the general unity of an investment” was already
confirmed, integrating “a number of juridical acts of all sorts” .235

In their argument concerning the unity of an investment the
Parties referred to the decisions in the arbitration
Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka A.S. (CSOB) v. Slovak Republic.
In CSOB, the arbitrators gave a clear definition of the unity
principle in their first decision:

ish Yearbook of International Law (1980), 123, 159.

366.

367.

368.

“An investment is frequently a rather complex operation,
composed of various interrelated transactions, each
element of which, standing alone, might not in all cases
qualify as an investment. Hence, a dispute that is brought
before the Centre must be deemed to arise directly out of
an investment even when it is based on a transaction
which, standing alone, would not qualify as an investment
under the Convention, provided that the particular
transaction forms an integral part of an overall operation
that qualifies as an investment.” 236

At the hearing in the present case the Respondents argued that
in a subsequent decision the CSOB tribunal restricted this
general principle, stating that “in order to incorporate disputes
under other contracts, they must be the same parties in the
dispute” .287

The present Tribunal noted that, in its decision on further
objections to jurisdiction of 1 December 2000, the CSOB
tribunal referred to its earlier decision in which it held that
“CSOB’s claim and the related loan facility made available to SI
qualify as investments ...”. In its subsequent decision, that
tribunal qualified its earlier decision by adding:

“This does not mean, however, that the Tribunal thereby
automatically acquires jurisdiction with regard to each
agreement concluded to implement the wider investment
operation. Other requirements have to be met for such
jurisdiction to be established.”238

The CSOB tribunal went on to refer to the requirement of
consent, refusing to extend the scope of the agreement to
arbitrate to other contracts2%9 to which the Slovak Republic was
not a party. The decisive difference, therefore, was the absence
of consent to arbitration by the Slovak Republic.

In the present case, the investment project, consisting in the
development of marginal and non-producing gas fields, was the
subject of a number of different agreements and other legal
instruments, some of which were named in the JVA and
attached to it. The JVA provides for the development of the
Chattak and Feni fields and then addresses, in its Article 24,
“Petroleum Sale and Transmission” (the Agreement defined
petroleum as including gaseous hydrocarbons):

“OPERATOR |i.e. Niko] and BAPEX (hereinafter referred to
as Seller) agree to sell the produced Petroleum to the
Bangladesh domestic market under this JVA. BUYER of
JV’s gas shall be Petrobangla or a designee of Petrobangla
(hereinafter referred to as BUYER). BUYER & SELLER shall
enter into a Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (GPSA)
under which the Buyer shall agree to purchase the
Petroleum to which the Seller is entitled to under this JVA,
subject to deliverability and testing and proof of such
Petroleum. OPERATOR shall be free to find a market outlet
within the Country if a market outlet is not given by
Petrobanla within six months after a request is made.”

The GPSA, in turn, makes express reference in its Preamble to
the JVA under which the Seller (i.e. the Joint Venture Partners)
“is authorised to produce and sell Natural Gas”. It then
continues:

“Under Article 24 of the JVA and upon the terms and
conditions as set in this Agreement, the Seller has
proposed to sell and deliver Natural Gas as produced from
the Feni gas field and the Buyer has agreed to purchase
and receive the same from the Seller for consumption in the
domestic market’.

These two provisions confirm and underline the commercial
logic of the operation: the sale of the gas produced by the Joint
Venture Partners is a necessary component of the investment.

The Tribunal concludes that the GPSA is a constituent part of
the investment operation. Given the function assigned under
the law of Bangladesh to Petrobangla, an agreement for the sale
and purchase of gas produced from this investment was a
necessary element of this operation. The GPSA forms part of

102

the legal instruments through which Niko’s investment in
Bangladesh has been implemented. Disputes arising out of the
GPSA, like those arising out of the JVA, are legal disputes
“arising directly out of an investment’ in the sense of Article
25(1).

103

9. ILLEGAL ACTS, GOOD FAITH AND CLEAN HANDS

373. The Respondents argue that Niko has committed acts of
corruption and that therefore it may not benefit from the
agreements in general and from the ICSID arbitration clause in
particular. The Claimant denies that, apart from the acts which
formed the subject of the decision in Canada (the Canadian
conviction),?4° it has committed any illegal act.

9.1 The Parties’ positions

374. When this objection was first presented, the Respondents
submitted:

“... jurisdiction must be denied because the Claimant has
violated the principles of good faith and international public
policy.

This Tribunal is empowered to protect the integrity of the
ICSID dispute settlement mechanism by dismissing a claim
which represents a violation of fundamental principles of
law.”241

375. Citing extracts from two ICSID awards?42 the Respondents
continued:

“(i) the obligation to act in good faith, and (ii) the
requirement of legality of the investment in accordance with
the law of the host State, apply both to the initiation of the
investment and its performance. As noted by the Phoenix
tribunal, ‘the purpose of the international protection is to
protect legal and bona fide investments’. Thus when there
is an allegation of fraudulent conduct by the foreign
investor, tribunals should examine all the circumstances
surrounding the lifespan of the investment, having direct
relation to the investment claim. As stated by the Phoenix
tribunal, one function of an ICSID tribunal is ‘to prevent an
abuse of the system of international investment protection

104

under the ICSID Convention, in ensuring that only
investments that are made in compliance with the
international principle of good faith and do not attempt to
misuse the system are protected’.”243

376. Later they developed their position and argued that:

“... Jurisdiction should be denied because the Claimant has
violated the principles of good faith and international public
policy, in a manner intimately linked to the alleged
investment. The Tribunal is empowered to protect the
integrity of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism by
dismissing a claim which represents a violation of
fundamental principles of law. The Claimant does not bring
this claim with clean hands. That is not affected by the
question whether or not its bribery achieved its admitted
purpose.”244

377. Responding to a question of the Tribunal, the Respondents
summarised their position as follows:

“(1) An admitted aim of the two acts of bribery set out in
the Agreed Statement of Facts was ‘to persuade the
Bangladesh Energy Minister to exercise his influence to
ensure that Niko was able to secure a gas purchase and
sales agreement acceptable to Niko’ (the other being ‘to
ensure the company was dealt with fairly in relation to
claims for compensation for the blowouts’): para. 58.

(2) As defined in domestic and international law, an act
of bribery is complete when the benefit is provided to the
public official, with the intention of influencing that official’s
performance of his or her functions. Whether or not the
bribe in fact causes the official to act as the briber desired
is not within the briber’s control, and does not affect the
gravity of the briber’s conduct.

(3) Whether or not the bribe had a causal link with the
conclusion of the contract may be relevant where one party
to the contract argues that it is void or voidable.

(4) The Respondents do not intend to argue that the
contract is void or voidable, by reason of corruption or

°43 R_CMJ.1, paragraph 57 (references omitted).
24 R_CMJ.2 — Payment Claim, paragraph 53.

105

otherwise. They would, of course, revisit this position if
further disclosure made it appropriate to do so.

(5) The question in this case is whether ICSID
jurisdiction should be denied to a claimant which attempts
to procure a contract by bribery, or only to one which
succeeds.

(6) The Respondents intend to argue that the Tribunal
should decline jurisdiction because, in attempting to
procure by bribery the very agreement on which its
jurisdiction would be based, the Claimant has violated the
principles of good faith and international public policy, in a
manner intimately linked to the alleged investment. The
Tribunal is empowered to protect the integrity of the ICSID
dispute settlement mechanism by dismissing a claim which
represents a violation of fundamental principles of law. The
Claimant does not bring this claim in good faith or with
clean hands. That is not affected by whether or not, on the
facts, the bribery achieved its admitted purpose.

The Respondents submit that the fact that the Claimant’s
proven bribery was intended to procure the conclusion of
that Agreement [the GPSA] suffices as a bar to the
admissibility of the claim.”245

378. In response the Claimant argued that:

“The Respondents’ contention that requirements of good
faith and legality apply throughout the life of the
investment, overstates the scope of the principle and
incorrectly applies rulings based on particular bilateral
investment treaties explicitly requiring ongoing compliance
with local law.”?46

379. Pointing out that in the present case there is no bilateral

investment treaty at issue, the Claimant continued, relying
essentially on the same ICSID awards as the Respondents:

>45 Respondents’ letter of 29 August 2011, responding to the Tribunal’s letter of 26 August 2011.
46 C_MJ.2, paragraph 51.

106

380.

381.

382.

“Absent special requirements imposed by treaty, the
international law requirements of good faith relate to the
creation of the investment, and in some instances the
acquisition of an investment for an improper purpose.
Obviously, in some instances bad faith performance is
relevant, in that rights arising from illegal acts will not be
recognized where a BIT requires ongoing compliance with
local law. Also, contracts which have corruption as their
objective are not enforceable.

It is apparent from these cases that there must be a nexus
between the alleged corruption or bad faith and the
contract sought to be enforced. As the tribunal in World
Duty Free, supra, plainly put the rule:

... Thus, claims based on contracts of corruption or
on contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld
”247

The question which the Tribunal must examine therefore is
whether any instance of bribery and corruption in which the
Claimant has been or may have been involved deprives the
Claimant from having its claims considered and ruled upon by
the present Tribunal.

9.2 The Canadian conviction of Niko Canada on account
of bribes to the Minister of Energy in 2005

The Respondents rely on several incidents of alleged corruption
in which the Claimant and its parent company were, according
to the Respondents, implicated.

One of these incidents is in substance uncontested. It concerns
two acts between February and June 2005, providing benefits to
Mr Mosharaf Hossain, the then Bangladesh State Minister for
Energy and Mineral Resources. These acts were the subject of a
criminal investigation in Canada, leading to the conviction of
Niko Canada on 24 June 2011.?48 The conviction was based on
an Agreed Statement of Facts, signed by officers of that
company.249 The following account is based on this text.

47 C_MJ.2, paragraphs 53 and 54.

107

383.

384.

385.

386.

388.

389.

The Agreed Statement describes the difficulties of Niko as a
result of having signed the JVA without securing the contract
for the sale of the gas. When gas became available, Niko
commenced delivery of the gas but had not reached agreement
with Petrobangla about the price for the gas. The difficulties
were aggravated by the blowouts.

In February 2005 Niko Bangladesh made a down payment for
the purchase of a Toyota Land Cruiser at the price of Canadian
$190,984. Niko Bangladesh had originally been requested to
purchase the Land Cruiser pursuant to the terms of the JVA
which allowed for assets to be purchased by the Operator (Niko
Bangladesh) for use by the JVA partner (BAPEX). The vehicle
was registered to BAPEX but not given to it. BAPEX instructed
Niko Bangladesh to deliver the vehicle to the Minister. In the
presence of two representatives of Niko the Land Cruiser was
delivered to the home of the Minister on 23 May 2005.25°

In June 2005 the Minister travelled to Calgary to attend the Gas
& Oil Exposition as a guest of Niko Canada. The “non-business
related portion of the travel and expenses” were quantified in the
Agreed Statement at Canadian $5,000.

No other acts of corruption are related in the Agreed Statement.

The delivery of the vehicle to the Minister soon became known
in Bangladesh and was publicised in the press. On 18 June
2005 the Minister resigned. On 20 June 2005 the vehicle was
returned to BAPEX.

As explained above, the GPSA was signed on 27 December
2006.

The sentence in the Canadian proceedings provided as
punishment of Niko Canada the amount of Canadian $8.26
million plus a 15% “Victim Fine Surcharge”, leading to a total of
Canadian $9.499 million. The Agreed Statement of Facts
describes the considerations for the amount of the fine:

“The fine reflects that Niko Canada made these payments
in order to persuade the Bangladeshi Energy Minister to

these events has been produced at the Hearing as Hearing Exhibit C-4.

exercise his influence to ensure that Niko was able to
secure a gas purchase and sales agreement acceptable to
Niko, as well as to ensure the company was dealt with
fairly in relation to claims for compensation for the
blowouts, which represented potentially very large
amounts of money. The Crown is unable to prove that any
influence was obtained as a result of providing the benefits
to the Minister.

[I

In addition the Probation Order takes into consideration
steps already taken by Niko Canada to reduce the
likelihood of it committing a subsequent related offence.

In addition the sentence takes into consideration the fact
that the company has never been convicted of a similar
offence nor has it been sanctioned by a regulatory body for
a similar offence.

[...] The Probation Order also puts Niko Canada under the
Court’s supervision for the next three years to ensure
audits are done to examine Niko Canada’s compliance with
the Corruption of Foreign Officials Act.”?5!

390. The Claimant disclosed that the United States Department of

391.

Justice conducted an investigation related to the investigation
in Canada. On August 2011 it informed Niko Canada that it
“determined that it will discontinue its inquiry into potential
violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by Niko
Resources Ltd. (Niko)”. It explained that “prosecution is not
necessary at this time in light of Niko’s guilty plea in Canada”. It
pointed out that it “may decide to restart this enquiry at any
time” .252

The Claimant also disclosed: “Although the criminal charges in
Canada against Niko Resources Ltd appear to have been
resolved with the guilty pleas on June 24, 2011, other
regulatory investigations appear to remain outstanding.
Further, two Canadian law firms widely known for class action
law suits announced in late June 2011 that they were
investigating Niko’s disclosures, stock option practices and
foreign business practices”.

The Claimant stated that it was not aware of any criminal
investigations other than those in Canada and the United States
just described and the investigation in Bangladesh to be
discussed below.253 There is no indication that any other
convictions or investigations against the Claimant or the Niko
Group occurred in Canada or the United States in relation with
the project in Bangladesh.

9.3 Other indications of possible acts of corruption and
the Respondents’ disclosure request

The Respondents made reference to a number of investigations
and proceedings in Bangladesh and abroad as_ possible
indications of acts of corruption by the Claimant and its group.

9.3.1 Investigation by the Bangladesh _ Anticorruption
Commission (ACC)

The first of these proceedings concerned an investigation which
the Bangladesh Anticorruption Commission (ACC) initiated in
2007. The Respondents explained that the ACC filed at
“Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 20 of 2007 against government
officials under the provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act
1047 and the Penal Code 1860, and there continues to be a
pending charge against one former Prime Minister” .25+

The Tribunal asked the Respondents about this investigation.
The Respondents confirmed that the investigation was
commenced and invited the Tribunal to order the Claimant to
disclose any relevant documents.?55

The Claimant responded that it had received requests for
information from the ACC and that it was informed that the
ACC was investigating whether public officials of the
Government of Bangladesh accepted bribes in respect to
investments in Bangladesh. The investigations also concerned
Mr Qasim Sharif who was “at one time an officer of Claimant’.

The Claimant added that according to its information “most, if
not all, of the charges were stayed. The Claimant understands
that no further proceedings have yet been taken on any charges
that were not stayed, if in fact any charges remain
outstanding.”256

The Claimant declared that it “was not told that it was a target
of the investigation” .257

The Tribunal pursued this matter further at the hearing. Mr
Adolf confirmed that ACC had approached Niko, requesting
access to its files, and were provided such access. He added that
he did not think that “there is any further action taking place” .25°
Mr Imam Hossain, named as witness by the Respondents,
confirmed that his knowledge about the investigation was “the
same as Mr Adolf’, but added that “one investigation is going on
by the ACC and they have seized some files from Petrobangla”.?59

Towards the end of the hearing the Claimant’s counsel made
reference to documents emanating from the ACC and containing
the charges investigated by the Commission. He delivered these
documents to the Respondents’ counsel who introduced them in
the arbitration.2©° The documents contained detailed
discussions relating to the negotiations with Niko, the award of
the JVA and alleged illegalities committed in this context. One of
these documents, dated 5 May 2008, stated that a “memo was
filed with recommendation to file charge sheet’ against 11
persons, including a former Prime Minister, several Ministers
and civil servants as well as Mr Qasim Sharif.26! The other,
dated 7 May 2008, is entitled “Charge Sheet’.?62

The Respondents’ counsel stated that they had been unaware of
the charge sheets prior to their delivery by the Claimant’s
counsel towards the end of the hearing; they could not provide
any information about the status of these investigations.

Apart from the comments referred to above, no further evidence
was provided about the investigations by the ACC.

9.3.2 The BELA proceedings

One of the claims raised in the legal action brought in the BELA
proceedings?® was that the JVA was “a nullity having been
procured through flawed processes and resorting to fraudulent
means and forged documents by Niko”.

This case was concluded by the decision of the Supreme Court
of Bangladesh, High Court Division of 2 and 3 May 2010, i.e.
two years after the ACC Charge Sheet. The decision contains an
examination of the process which led to the conclusion of the
JVA. The Court concluded:

“From the above, we do find that the JVA was not obtained
by flawed process by resorting to fraudulent means.”26+

At the hearing Mr Adolf referred to the BELA proceedings stating
that this case concluded “that the contracts were awarded
properly and that they were valid’.2°5 He was not contradicted
by the Respondents or their witness.

The decision in the BELA proceedings is the only court decision
in Bangladesh brought to the Tribunal’s attention which makes
a finding with respect to the legality of the Claimant’s conduct
and the conclusion of the agreements.

9.3.3 The proceedings against Stratum

Respondents made reference to another investigation relating to
the JVA, stating:

“It has been reported that a consulting firm (Stratum) and
one of its employees hired by Niko Canada in Bangladesh
were also charged by the ACC after the agency
investigated ‘details surrounding Niko’s joint venture
contract with the Bangladesh government’.”26®

°67 Available at http: 2 2009/januar

The only support provided by the Respondents for this
allegation was an article on the Trade Lawyers Blog.26’ The
article is dated 18 January 2009 and starts by reporting on the
Canadian investigation considered above. It continues by
mentioning the investigation of the ACC, leading to a filing of
charges in December 2007 against a former Prime Minister for
failing to recover from Niko “compensation for environmental
damage caused by a fire at a Niko drilling site in northeastern
Bangladesh in 2005”, presumably the blowouts in 2005.

The article concludes by stating that the ACC charged Stratum
“after the ACC looked into details surrounding Niko’s joint venture
contract with the Bangladesh government’. The article neither
states what the charges were, nor does it provide particulars as
to how Niko was said to have been involved.

In any event, the article on which the Respondents rely was
written prior to the finding of the High Court Division of May
2010, quoted above. In the Tribunal’s view, this article is not
sufficient to justify conclusions of corruption as suggested by
the Respondents.

9.3.4 The action of Mr Harb

Finally there is reference to an investigation against Mr Marc
Harb, a Canadian Senator. Mr Harb had been retained by Niko
as consultant assisting in “resolving the compensation claims
and the Feni gas price issue” .2©8

At the hearing Mr Adolf testified that Mr Harb visited
Bangladesh in 2006 and that he “was performing his services for
us in an ethical way that was approved by the Ethics
Commissioner for the Government of Canada’ .2©9

During the course of his testimony Mr Adolf produced a press
release of Mr Harb which contained the following passages:

“Tam aware of the investigation that has been undertaken
by the RCMP [Royal Canadian Mounted Police] into Niko
Resources and I have cooperated fully with the RCMP.

I disclosed to the Senate Ethics Officer in a timely manner
the information regarding my work with Niko as I was
required to declare confidentially under the Conflict of
Interest Code for Senators. Moreover, I did not make any
representations to federal government officials nor did I use
my position as a Senator for personal gain or to further the
private interests of Niko.

As a city councillor, a Member of Parliament and as a
Senator, I have always put the public interest first. This
investigation has therefore caused me grave concern and I
have cooperated fully with the authorities. I am confident
that there will be no finding of wrongdoing |...].”27°

There is no indication that the intervention of Mr Harb
constituted in any way an illegal act by him or by the Niko
Group.

9.3.5 The Respondents’ request for document production

The Respondents argue that there may have been other relevant
acts of corruption. In order to develop their argument in this
respect, the Respondents request that the Claimant be ordered
to produce the relevant documents. The Parties were given the
opportunity to argue the issue. Their arguments may be
summarised as follows:

In their Counter-Memorial dated 16 May 2011, the Respondents
referred to the Canadian investigation and, in a footnote to
these explanations, made the following request:

“Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondents
request disclosure from the Claimant of all documents,
records and information in its control relating to such
allegations, investigations, charges, and proceedings” .?7!

416.

417.

418.

419.

420.

421.

 

In response, the Claimant objected to the request, stating that
“it goes far beyond what is reasonable” and that it “complies
with few, or none, of the usual conditions for document
production” .272 The Claimant added that, nevertheless it was
“prepared to make voluntary disclosure of any criminal
convictions relating to the alleged bribery allegations” .?7°

The Claimant explained that there was “one such conviction”; it
provided explanations and disclosed documents with respect to
the Canadian investigation and criminal conviction.?74

In an application of 16 August 2011, the Respondents requested
“access to the record of the criminal investigation carried out by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police”.

In response to a number of questions addressed on 26 August
2011 by the Secretariat to the Parties on instruction of the
Tribunal, the Respondents stated on 29 August 2011 that they
believed that “the Claimant may have committed further acts of
corruption in relation to its operation in Bangladesh” and referred
to three corruption investigations: (i) the Canadian
investigation, (ii) the ACC investigation against the Claimant
and others and (iii) the proceedings against Stratum. They
invited the Tribunal to order the Claimant “to disclose any
relevant documents regarding all three investigations”.

The Claimant responded on 6 September 2011, objecting to the
wide range of the request and argued that the matters
concerned were irrelevant, sensitive and subject to privilege. In
a letter of 27 September 2011, the Respondents insisted on the
disclosure requests concerning investigations in Canada, the
United States and Bangladesh.

The Claimant has disclosed the conviction of Niko Canada and
the Agreed Statement of Facts on which it was based and
provided information about the investigation in the United
States. The Claimant declared that it was not aware of any other
investigations, apart from those in Bangladesh. The Tribunal
sees no need for any further disclosure concerning these
proceedings in Canada and the United States.

With respect to the proceedings in Bangladesh, the Tribunal is
of the view that the Respondents themselves were best placed to
provide all relevant information. They have failed to do so. The
Tribunal sees no justification for ordering the Claimant to
produce information which, if it existed, was surely available to
the Respondents.

9.3.6 Conclusion on the Claimant’s acts of corruption

The Tribunal has carefully examined the evidence before it and
concluded that the Claimant has committed the acts of
corruption which were sanctioned in the Canadian conviction.

The Tribunal is aware that acts of corruption are often difficult
to prove, and arbitral tribunals have only very limited means to
reach their conclusions. While they must bear in mind these
difficulties they must also be aware that findings of corruption
are a serious matter which should not be reached lightly. As
the tribunal put it in Hamester v. Ghana, a tribunal would “only
decide on substantiated facts, and cannot base itself on
inferences” .275

In the present case, the acts of corruption of which the
Claimant was convicted were committed in Bangladesh. If there
were any other such acts committed they must have concerned
persons making decisions in Bangladesh. Therefore, the
authorities of Bangladesh were best placed to investigate and
collect proof of corruption relevant for the present case.

The ACC, the competent authority in Bangladesh, commenced
its investigations in 2008 or even earlier. Judging from the
evidence before the Tribunal, these investigations have not led
to any trial, let alone conviction for acts of corruption that may
be attributed to the Claimant and its group. Quite to the
contrary, in the BELA proceedings the Supreme Court of
Bangladesh concluded, as quoted above, that “the JVA was not
obtained by flawed process by resorting to fraudulent means”.

*5 Hamester Award, paragraph 134.

116

427.

428.

429.

430.

The Tribunal also had before it the considerations which
determined the sentence imposed in the Canadian proceedings.
These considerations include findings such as: “the company
has never been convicted of a similar offence nor has it been
sanctioned by a regulator body for a similar offence”. In addition
“the Probation Order [took] into consideration steps already taken
by Niko Canada to reduce the likelihood of it committing a
subsequent related offence”; it put Niko Canada “under the
Court’s supervision for the next three years to ensure audits are
done to examine Niko Canada’s compliance with the Corruption
Foreign Public Officials Act’ .27©

In view of these circumstances, the Tribunal has no reason to
conclude that, apart from the acts subject of the Canadian
conviction, other acts of corruption were committed by the
Claimant or its group.

Finally, as concerns the effect of the acts of corruption, the
Tribunal notes that the Canadian authorities were “unable to
prove that any influence was obtained as a result of providing
the benefits to the Minister”. No allegation to the contrary was
made in this arbitration. Bearing in mind the quoted finding of
the Supreme Court of Bangladesh concerning the absence of
“fraudulent means” in the making of the JVA, the Tribunal has
no reason to believe that corruption had any influence in the
conclusion or the content of the JVA or the GSPA.

9.4 Corruption and international public policy

The Respondents state that “Corruption is unlawful in domestic
and international law”, adding that “bribery is illegal under the
law of Bangladesh” and that “corruption is condemned
throughout the world’.277 These statements are uncontested by
the Claimant. They are obvious and there is no need for further
development on the point.278

In their objections to jurisdiction the Respondents take this
point a step further and argue that “corruption is contrary to the
principles of good faith, clean hands and international public
policy’.?79 It is widely accepted that the prohibition of bribery is
of such importance for the international legal order that it forms
part of what has been described as international or
transnational public policy.28°

Arbitral awards and learned writers have supported this
position. The matter was considered in particular detail and
with admirable erudition in the World Duty Free case?®! by a
distinguished tribunal. This tribunal concluded that “bribery is
contrary to the international public policy of most, if not all, States
or, to use another formula, to transnational public policy”.?®?_ The
tribunal reached this conclusion on the basis of an analysis of a
large number of international conventions, the decisions of
national and international courts and tribunals, and legal
writings.

The present Tribunal is not aware of any contrary position and
none has been brought to its attention by the Parties in the
course of this proceeding. The Tribunal therefore accepts
without further development that the prohibition of bribery
forms part of international public policy.

9.5 Contracts of corruption

The consequence of this conclusion is that, as a principle of
international public policy, the prohibition of bribery overrides
the general principle of party autonomy which is widely
recognised in international and comparative law. Normally,
arbitral tribunals respect and give effect to contracts concluded
by the parties which agreed on the arbitration clause from
which they derive their powers. However, party autonomy is not
without limits. In international transactions the most important
of such limits is that of international public policy. A contract

in conflict with international public policy cannot be given effect
by arbitrators.

435. Thus, contracts which have as their object the corruption of civil
servants have been denied effect by international arbitrators.
One of the earliest and best known examples is the award by
Judge Gunnar Lagergren in ICC Case 1110 of 1963.283 Judge
Lagergren found that the agreement on which the claims before
him were based “contemplated the bribing of Argentinian
officials”. He relied on “the general principles denying arbitrators
the power to entertain disputes of this nature”. Parties to such
contracts “have forfeited the right to ask for assistance of the
machinery of justice (national courts or arbitral tribunals) in
settling their disputes.”284+

436. Courts in a number of countries?85 and arbitral tribunals?8©
have found that contracts having influence peddling or bribery
as their objectives or motives were void or unenforceable. Legal
writers have supported these conclusions.28”7 In this context
reference is often made to the adages such as Ex injuria jus non
oritur288 or Nullus commodum capere potest de sua injuria
propria?8° or the Roman law principle Nemo auditur propriam
turpitudinem allegans.?°°

There has been some controversy about the question whether
Judge Lagergren was correct in denying jurisdiction to claims
contrary to international public policy or whether the correct
conclusion would have been for the international arbitrator to
accept jurisdiction and declare that the claims were contrary to
international public policy and therefore must be denied by a
decision on the merits of the claims.?9! The matter need not be
considered further here since the present case is fundamentally
different from those cases in which a claimant seeks to enforce
a contract which, directly or indirectly, has corruption as its
object.

In the present case, the agreements on which the claims are
based have as their object the development of
marginal/abandoned gas fields and the sale of gas from such
fields. It has not been argued that there is anything illegal
about the object and the content of these contracts. The
Tribunal has not been made aware of any such illegality. The
reasons which lead to the unenforceability of contracts for
corruption do not apply to the agreements considered in the
present case.

The question therefore is whether the acts of corruption
committed by the Claimant affect the validity of the otherwise
legal agreements or the arbitration clause contained in them.

9.6 Contracts obtained by corruption

The World Duty Free tribunal stated that

“... claims based on contracts of corruption or on contracts
obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by this Arbitral

Tribunal.” 292

This passage has been quoted by other tribunals and learned
writers. In this arbitration both Parties have made reference to
it.

The discussion in the preceding section of this Decision has
shown that the conclusion in the quoted sentence with respect

?°"T alive Report, p. 294.
°° World Duty Free Award, paragraph 157.

120

443.

444,

445.

446.

to the first category of contract is a direct consequence of the
application of international public policy to contracts of
corruption. The conclusion with respect to the second category
requires further consideration.

There is indeed a fundamental difference between the two types
of situations. In contracts of corruption, the object of the
contract is the corruption of a civil servant and this object is
intended by both parties to the contract. In contracts obtained
by corruption, one of the parties normally is aware of the
corruption and intends to obtain the contract by these means.
But this is not necessarily the case for the other side. As
explained in the World Duty Free award, bribes normally are
covert. In that case the bribe was received not by the
Government or another public entity but by an individual, the
then President of the country. As the World Duty Free tribunal
held, the receipt of the bribe is “not legally imputed to Kenya
itself. If it were otherwise, the payment would not be a bribe” .?93

In the case of covert bribes the other side, innocent of the
corruption, may have a justified interest in preserving the
contract.

In public international law the rule for dealing with this type of
situation is incorporated in Article 50 of the Vienna Convention
on the Law of Treaties. The provision reads as follows:

“Article 50
Corruption of a representative of a State

If the expression of a State’s consent to be bound by a
treaty has been procured through the corruption of its
representative directly or indirectly by another negotiating
State, the State may invoke such corruption as invalidating
its consent to be bound by the treaty.”

In other words, a treaty may be avoided by invalidating the
consent of the victim of corruption. This principle may be taken
as a general principle not only of public international law but as
a general principle of law and as such applicable to contracts

3 Thid., paragraph 169.

121

447.

448.

449.

concluded by States. The United Nations Convention against
Corruption2% provides guidance in Article 34:

“With due regard to the rights of third parties acquired in
good faith, each State Party shall take measures, in
accordance with the fundamental principles of its domestic
law, to address the consequences of corruption. In this
context, State Parties may consider a relevant factor in
legal proceedings to annul or rescind a contract, withdraw
a concession or other similar instrument or take any other
remedial action.”

The essential elements to be taken from this provision are first
of all that rights of third parties acquired in good faith must be
protected and second that the consequences of corruption may
lead to the annulment or rescission of a contract, the
withdrawal of such rights as a concession; but these
consequences are not automatic. They must be considered as
“a relevant factor in legal proceedings”.

The position taken in domestic law of various countries is quite
similar. English law, for instance, resembles that expressed in
Article 50 of the Vienna Convention:

“... a contract procured by bribery is voidable at the
instance of the party whose agent was bribed”.?95

The situation has been considered by Lord Mustill in the
opinion which he presented in the World Duty Free case.
Describing the position of English law he wrote:

“Tf, in the course of negotiating a contract between X and Y,
an improper inducement is offered by B (acting on behalf of
Y) to A (acting on behalf of X) which causes or contributes
to the making of a contract; and if this fact is afterwards
discovered, to what extent is X bound by the contract thus
made?”

I answer this question, in terms of English law, as follows:
(a) X is entitled at his option to rescind the contract; and in

any event to regard it as no longer binding for the
future;

122

450.

451.

452.

453.

454.

(b) X is not however compelled to take this course. He may
choose to waive this right to rescind the contract; keep
the contract alive and enforce it according to its
terms. ”296

Lord Mustill continued by referring to “the considerable, and
rather amorphous, body of case-law often informally grouped
under the heading of illegality’ and then referred to “a succinct
statement of English law on the topic as it now stands” in the
words of Justice Millett. He described him as “one of the most
authoritative Chancery Judges of recent times” and quoted him
with the following words:

“It is well established that a principal who discovers that
his agent in a transaction has obtained or arranged to
obtain a bribe or secret commission from the other party to
the transaction is entitled, in addition to other remedies
which may be open to him, to elect to rescind the
transaction ab initio or, if it is too late to rescind, to bring it
to an end for the future.”297

This rule of English law expresses a fundamental principle of
fairness: the innocent victim of an illegality must have the
choice whether it accepts the otherwise legal transaction in the
terms as concluded or wishes to avoid it. Obviously, the victim
should not be sanctioned for the other party’s illegality by being
deprived of the bargain struck which it might find to its
advantage.

The Respondents have not argued that under the law of
Bangladesh contracts concluded under the influence of bribery
are invalid. They have not addressed this aspect of the law. As
shall be discussed, the Respondents do not rely on the
avoidance of the Agreements.

Before considering this aspect of avoidance, the question of
causation must be addressed briefly.

The case of bribery which has been established in the present
case did not procure the contracts on which the claims in this
arbitration are based. The JVA had been concluded long before

26 Thid., paragraph 164.
"7 Thid., quoting the decision in LogiRose v. Southend United Football Club [1988] 1 W.L.R. 1256, at

the acts of corruption. The Minister who received the benefit of
the vehicle and of the invitation to the United States was forced
to resign quickly thereafter in June 2005. The GPSA was
concluded only some 18 months later, in December 2006.

Thus, there is no link of causation between the established acts
of corruption and the conclusion of the agreements, and it is not
alleged that there is such a link. Instead, the Respondents
argue that an attempt to obtain a contract by bribery is
sufficient to deny recourse to ICSID arbitration to the party
having made such an attempt.298

More importantly, the Respondents have not sought to avoid the
agreements nor did they state that the Agreements were void ab
initio. In response to the Tribunal’s questions prior to the
hearing, they stated:

“The Respondents do not intend to argue that the contract
is void or voidable, by reason of corruption or otherwise.
They would, of course, revisit this position if further
disclosure made it appropriate to do so.”299

At the hearing the Respondents confirmed this position. They
explained that the issue arising from the objections they raise
“is the clean hands issue. It is independent of the status of the
contracts themselves” .3°°

The position was again confirmed shortly thereafter:

“We are not saying that anything is void or voidable, we
are saying that in these circumstances it is a question of
the integrity of the system as a whole in these
circumstances,”3°!

While the Respondents rely inter alia on the decision of the
arbitration tribunal in the World Duty Free case, it deserves
noting that the position just described is quite different from
that taken by the Republic of Kenya in that case. Kenya
avoided the contract in issue by a formal declaration and did so

should be denied to a claimant which attempts to procure an investment contract by bribery, or only to
one which succeeds.”

“unequivocally and timeously”.°°2 Throughout the proceedings
in the present case the Respondents made no such declaration;
to the contrary, as the statement at the hearing quoted above
shows, the Respondents did not intend to treat the agreements
as avoided.

Towards the end of the hearing new circumstances arose, which
may have brought about a change in the Respondents’ position,
as they had reserved to do in their response to the Tribunal
quoted above. These new circumstances arose when Claimant’s
counsel made reference to documents emanating from the ACC
and containing the allegations made before this commission.°°
As explained above, he delivered these documents to the
Respondents’ counsel who decided, after having examined the
documents, to introduce the documents in the arbitration.2°+
The Respondents’ counsel then argued:

“MS MACDONALD: Yes, the key allegation is that the JVA
was obtained by — well there are a number of allegations
but for our purposes the relevant one is that the JVA was
obtained by bribery on the part of, among others, Mr Qasim
Sharif so we think this is quite fundamental and certainly,
as far as we are concerned, fundamentally changes the
complexion of the case and some of our arguments.”93°5

In their closing argument, the Respondents referred to the
newly produced documents, stating that:

“... it would not be responsible for us to let pass if we are
confronted with documents suggesting that the JVA was
obtained by bribery. Responsibly we need to ask for an
opportunity to deal with that if that becomes necessary in
due course.”306

However, neither at that occasion nor at any time thereafter did
the Respondents declare the JVA, the GSPA or the arbitration
clauses contained in them as avoided. To the knowledge of this
Tribunal, the Respondents continue to enjoy the benefit of these
agreements.

The Tribunal concludes that the Respondents do not rely on the
proven nor on the alleged acts of corruption as grounds for
avoiding the agreements and the arbitration clauses contained
therein. Their defence is that, even though the agreements are
still in force, the Claimant may not rely on their respective
ICSID arbitration clauses.

Therefore, the Tribunal is of the view that, in the absence of a
clear declaration by the Respondents and given that there is no
illegality in the content of the Agreements or in their
performance, it may not treat the Agreements as avoided or
invalid. It will now consider the Respondents’ argument that
the Claimant nevertheless should be deprived of relying on the
agreement to arbitrate in ICSID proceedings disputes arising
from the Agreements.

9.7 Denial of jurisdiction despite an otherwise binding
arbitration agreement

Since the agreements and with them the arbitration clauses
have not been avoided, they remain in force and binding. The
Respondents nevertheless argue that, because of the act of
bribery linked to the investment and for which Niko Canada has
been convicted, ICSID jurisdiction should be denied to the
Claimant. If this position were accepted, Petrobangla and
BAPEX could invoke the arbitration clauses but Niko could not.

In support of their position the Respondents invoke several lines
of argument: (i) the offer of ICSID arbitration applies only to
investments made in good faith, (ii) accepting jurisdiction would
jeopardise the integrity of the ICSID dispute settlement
mechanism and (iii) the doctrine of clean hands.

9.7.1 Arbitration offer applicable only for good faith investment

The first line of arguments refers to a number of awards in
ICSID arbitration proceedings.°°7 In one of these cases the
Tribunal stated that:

57 R-CMJ.1, paragraphs 54 et seq.

126

468.

469.

470.

471.

472.

“... States cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID
dispute settlement mechanism to investment not made in
good faith.” 308

Other cases which the Respondents cite relate not specifically to
the dispute settlement mechanism but more generally to
substantive rights granted to the investor under the treaty;
awards in some of these cases state that the protection of the
treaty does not apply to investments not made in good faith or
in violation of the law of the host State.

The quoted observation, as similar other references to which the
Respondents refer, relates to treaties in which a State makes a
commitment to another State, offering to nationals of that other
State to abide by certain rules, including the settlement of
investment disputes by ICSID or other forms of arbitration. The
offer is made to an unknown number of unidentified foreign
investors. In the context of such treaties, the circumstances
might justify the conclusion that the host State offers access to
the dispute settlement regime provided by the treaty only
subject to certain conditions.

However, in the present case jurisdiction is not based on sucha
treaty but on two agreements. The arbitration clause in these
agreements is not merely an offer subject to conditions which
may or may not be accepted. Rather it contains a firm
agreement binding both parties to submit their disputes to
ICSID arbitration.

The question whether the investment was made in good faith or
not and, if not, what consequences would have to be drawn
from it, are matters which must be resolved in the agreed
manner. In a contractual dispute as the present one, alleged or
established lack of good faith in the investment does not justify
the denial of jurisdiction but must be considered as part of the
merits of the dispute.

In this context the Respondents also make reference to the
World Duty Free award,9°° issued in a contract case. The
reasons developed in that award are of no assistance to the
Respondents, precisely because in that case, as explained

127

473.

474.

475.

476.

above, the Government of Kenya had avoided the agreement; the
tribunal had accepted jurisdiction; and in the exercise of that
mandate denied the claim on the merits.

9.7.2 Protecting the “integrity of the system”

In another line of argument, the Respondents submit that it
“would violate the principles of international public policy to
afford the Claimant access to ICSID”.3!° In this context the
Respondents speak of the Tribunal’s power “to protect the
integrity of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism”.31!

The Tribunal is mindful of the importance of the ICSID dispute
settlement mechanism and its integrity. In the Tribunal’s view,
such integrity is promoted, and not violated, by the adjudication
of disputes submitted to the Centre under a valid consent to
arbitrate. Faced with a binding arbitration agreement and
subject to the specific requirements under the ICSID
Convention, considered elsewhere in this decision, the Tribunal
must address the substance of the dispute. In so doing, the
integrity of the system is protected by the resolution of the
contentions made (including allegations of violation of public
policy) rather than by avoiding them.

In the present case ICSID arbitration is invoked not in pursuit
of a claim for corruption nor for claims under an otherwise
illegal contract. The Claimant seeks performance of agreements
which, despite the Respondents’ knowledge about the
sanctioned cases of bribery, have not been avoided and from
which the Respondents continue to benefit. The Tribunal
cannot see why hearing and resolving these claims under the
given circumstances would affect the integrity of the ICSID
system.

9.7.3 The “clean hands” doctrine

Finally, the Respondents state that the Claimant “does not bring
this claim with clean hands’.*!2 In a footnote of its First

Counter-Memorial it had explained that the “‘clean hands’
principle is well recognised in common law” and referred to a
decision of the High Court of Australia.3!3 The Respondents
also quote from the Individual Opinion which Judge Manley
Hudson delivered in the case before the Permanent Court of
International Justice (PCIJ) and concerning the Diversion of
Water from the Meuse.3'* That opinion relies on a legal principle
described by various expressions including the maxim “He who
seeks equity must do equity”; it is often referred to as a
particularly important manifestation of the “clean hands”
principle.315

477. The principle of clean hands is known as part of equity in
common law countries. The question whether the principle
forms part of international law remains controversial and its
precise content is ill defined. The situation has been analysed in
great detail in a recent award in the case of Guyana v. Suriname
by an Arbitral Tribunal Constituted Pursuant to Article 287,
and in Accordance with Annex VII of the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). That UNCLOS
Tribunal$!6 found:

“No generally accepted definition of the clean hands
doctrine has been elaborated in international law. Indeed,
the Commentaries of the ILC Draft Articles on State
Responsibility acknowledge that the doctrine has been
applied rarely and, when it has been invoked, its
expression has come in many forms. The ICJ has on
numerous occasions declined to consider the application of
the doctrine, and has never relied on it to bar admissibility
of a claim or recovery. However, some support for the
doctrine can be found in dissenting opinions in certain ICT
cases, as well as in opinions in cases of the Permanent
Court of International Justice (‘PCIJ’). [...] These cases
indicate that the use of the clean hands doctrine has been

sparse, and its application in the instances in which it has
been invoked has been inconsistent.”3!7

478. While the ILC Special Rapporteur Crawford concluded (quoting
Rousseau?!8) that “it is not possible to consider the ‘clean
hands’ theory as an institution of general customary law”,3!9
others are of the view that, primarily because of its recognition
in the domestic orders of many States, it must be qualified as a
general principle of law.32°

479. Concerning the substantive content of the principle in
international law, it has been summarised by Fitzmaurice:

“He who comes to equity for relief must come with ‘clean
hands’. Thus a State which is guilty of illegal conduct may
be deprived of the necessary locus standi in judicio for
complaining of corresponding illegalities on the part of other
States, especially if these were consequential on or were
embarked upon in order to counter its own illegality — in
short were provoked by it.”3?1

480. As shown by this quotation, the application of the principle
requires some form of reciprocity, so much so that, in his
Individual Opinion in the Diversion of Water from the Meuse
case, Hudson assimilated it to the Roman law principle of the
exceptio non adimpleti contractus.322 In that case, the claimant
State sought to prevent the defendant State from making use of
waters from the Meuse which it considered contrary to a treaty;
but the claimant State itself was making use of the waters in a
similar manner. Similarly, the case of unclean hands to which
Judge Schwebel referred in his dissenting opinion in the Military
and Paramilitary Activities case concerned acts of aggression

which he saw on the side of the claimant State in relation to
those of the defendant State.$25

When considering the defendant State’s admissibility argument
based on clean hands, the UNCLOS Arbitral Tribunal, dealing
with this doctrine “to the extent that such a doctrine may exist in
international law’, referred to three criteria which it had
extracted from those cases in which reference to the doctrine
had been made, in particular the developments in the opinion of
Judge Hudson: (i) the breach must concern a continuing
violation, (ii) the remedy sought must be “protection against
continuance of that violation in the future”, not damages for past
violations and (iii) there must be a relationship of reciprocity
between the obligations considered.32+

In a wider sense, it has been argued that the clean hands
doctrine, without express mention of the term, has found
application in a number of other cases where claims were
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction or as inadmissible because
they were obtained fraudulently or were not in accordance with
the law of the host State.9?5

Applying these considerations to the present case and the
Respondents’ objection based on the clean hands doctrine, it is
obvious that this objection does not meet the criteria which
Judge Hudson and the UNCLOS Arbitral Tribunal identified for
the application of the doctrine in international law. Here the
violation on which the Respondents rely is not continuing, but
consisted in two acts that have been completed long ago; the
remedy which the Claimant seeks does not concern protection
against this past violation; and there is no relation of reciprocity
between the relief which the Claimant now seeks in this
arbitration and the acts in the past which the Respondents
characterise as involving unclean hands.

More generally, when the events sanctioned by the Canadian
judgment occurred, the JVA had already been concluded. The
events were widely publicised in Bangladesh and, shortly after

they had become public the Minister concerned resigned.
Petrobangla and BAPEX, with the approval of the Bangladesh
Government, nevertheless entered into the GPSA. If and to the
extent the Claimant or its parent company had unclean hands,
the Respondents disregarded this situation. They may not now
rely on these events to deny jurisdiction under an arbitration
agreement which they then accepted. The additional details of
which the Respondents may have learned subsequently through
the account in Canadian judgment do not aggravate the offence
in any substantial manner compared to what was publicly
known in Bangladesh when the GPSA was concluded.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal may not rely on the events
subject of the Canadian judgment as grounds for refusing to
examine the merits of a dispute which the parties to the
agreements have accepted to submit to ICSID arbitration. The
Respondents’ objection based on acts of corruption must be
dismissed.

10. JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS UNDER THE
JVA (THE COMPENSATION DECLARATION AND THE
COOPERATION CLAIM)

10.1 The position of the Parties

486. The claims brought under the JVA concern primarily what the
Claimant calls the “Compensation Claims” pending in a court of
Bangladesh. The Claimant describes these claims as relating to
the proceedings commenced in June 2008 in the Court of
District Judge, Dhaka, No 224 of 2008 (the Money Suit) in
which Petrobangla and Bangladesh claim from Niko and others
“damages alleged to arise from the blowouts of 2 wells in the
Chattak field which were being drilled under the JVA” .326

487. In the Notices of Arbitration with respect to the Compensation
Claims which the Claimant served on the three Respondents on
8 January 2010, the Claimant sought that the following
disputes be arbitrated:

“(a) All claims held jointly or severally by any of Bapex,
Petrobangla and Bangladesh to damages or losses alleged
to arise from the blowouts of two wells which were then
being drilled under the JVA in the gas fields in Bangladesh
known as the Chattak gas field, including those arising
from the matters alleged in either the Legal Notice dated
May 27, 2008 issued on behalf of Petrobangla to Niko
and/or in the pleadings filed on behalf of Petrobangla in
the suit filed June, 2008 by Petrobangla and _ the
Government of Bangladesh against Niko and others in the
court of District Judge, Dhaka Bangladesh, no. 224 of
2008;

(b) Whether Niko is liable for any of the Compensation

Claims in whole or in part, and if it is liable, determination
of the amount of liability;”5?”

488.

491.

In RfA I the Claimant referred to this notice and repeated the
description of the dispute which it sought to arbitrate.328

The Preliminary Procedural Consultation clarified that the
Claimant sought essentially a declaration of non-liability which
then was described in this arbitration as the “Compensation
Declaration”. The relief requested by the Claimant was defined
as consisting essentially in:

“... a declaration that [the Claimant] has no liability for any
damage that may have arisen from the two well blowouts
which occurred on the Chattak wells and that it owes no
compensation for such damage” .329

In addition to the Compensation Declaration, the Claimant
seeks under the JVA a declaration concerning the obligation to
cooperate, which according to the Claimant, BAPEX owes under
the JVA, now referred to as the Cooperation Claim. The
Claimant expressed this Cooperation Claim in the form of the
following question:

“... whether Bapex is obliged under the JVA to cooperate
and agree with Niko to (i) commence arbitration
proceedings with Petrobangla under the [GPSA] and (ii)
terminate the GPSA and shut in all production from the
Feni gas field until such time as Petrobangla pays all
amounts invoiced for gas delivered to Petrobangla under
the GPSA and a new GPSA is made.”33°

The Respondents raise, in addition to the jurisdictional
objections concerning the two cases in general, the following
further objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal specifically
with respect to the request for the Compensation Declaration:

(i) The dispute relating to the well blowouts falls
outside the scope of the JVA.

(ii) Petrobangla is not a party to the JVA.

(iii) | Bangladesh is under no obligation under the JVA to
force BAPEX to cooperate with the Claimant in pursuing
claims under the GPSA.

(iv) Deciding on claims concerning the well blowout
claims “would involve determining the legal interests of
third parties (Petrobangla, Bangladesh and/or potential
private parties affected by the blowout) who are not before
the Tribunal’.331

The Claimant responds that “Niko merely seeks to settle through
arbitration the claims arising from the blow outs that have been
advanced against it by parties to the JVA (that is, Bangladesh
and Petrobangla, the only plaintiffs in the Money Suit)’ 352

The Tribunal will consider separately each of the specific
objections and the Claimant’s defence against them.

10.2 Jurisdiction ratione materiae

The Respondents refer to the passage in the arbitration clause
which describes the type of dispute to which it applies: “any
dispute arising in connection with the performance or
interpretation of any provision of this JVA ...”.. They argue that
the arbitration clause applies only “if the rights invoked derived
from a contractual commitment owed by one party to the other
under the JVA”.333. They explain that the liability of Niko, in
particular with respect to the claims made in the Money Suit,
arises essentially not out of the JVA but from “tort and statute
law”, “criminal or statutory liability’35+ and concerns “loss and
damage caused by negligence, lack of skill and proper
supervision’ ;335 as well as “environmental damage, loss of gas
and negligence relating to the two blowouts’.86 In the
Respondents’ position, claims on such bases are not of a
contractual nature and are outside the subject matter
jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

The Claimant relies on the same words in the arbitration clause
in the JVA which covers “any dispute arising in connection with
the performance or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement ...”. It argues that the arbitration clause must be
construed broadly and that the “JVA extensively addresses the
Operator’s standard of care and duties” and other matters
concerning the conduct of Petroleum Operations.387

The Tribunal notes that the JVA regulates important matters
which relate to Niko’s obligations as Operator. In particular,
Article 26 concerns the “Rights and Obligations of Operator”,
Article 27 “Health, Safety & Environment (HSE)”; other aspects
are regulated in Articles 6 (Business of Operator) and 20
(Indemnities) and in the annexes to the JVA, including the
Procedure for Development of Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Fields.

There can be no doubt that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to
determine whether Niko has any liability for the two blowouts
under the JVA and to make the requested declaration if it
deemed it to be well founded.

However, the declaration which the Claimant seeks is broader.
By referring to “any liability” the Claimant seems to extend the
declaration beyond the liability under the JVA to other grounds
for liability, such as those mentioned by the Respondents.

While the basis for arbitral jurisdiction is contractual, the
subject matter jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals need not be
limited to contractual claims. Other grounds of liability may be
included, depending on the scope of the arbitration agreement
and limits on arbitrability.

Arbitrability normally is governed by the law applicable to the
arbitration or the arbitration clause. In ICSID arbitration the
relevant law is the ICSID Convention and public international
law. The principal restriction on arbitrability in ICSID
arbitration has been discussed already: only disputes “arising
directly out of an investment’ are arbitrable under the ICSID
Convention. The Tribunal found that this requirement has been
met for both agreements. No other objection to arbitrability has
been raised.

357 C_MJ.3, paragraphs 7 et seq., 16.

136

501.

502.

503.

504.

Concerning the scope of the arbitration clause in the JVA, the
definition of the scope refers to the origin of the dispute: “arising
in connection with the performance or interpretation ...”. It does
not contain any limit as to the legal basis on which claims are
made. What is required is that the dispute be in connection
with the performance of the JVA.

The performance of the JVA, as has just been mentioned,
touches on a variety of substantive matters which are regulated
not in the agreement itself but by laws, regulations and
practices concerning Petroleum Operations. This appears from
a number of provisions in the JVA and is set out in a general
provision in Article 26.2.4 which prescribes that Niko as the
Operator shall:

“conduct all Petroleum Operations in a_ diligent,
conscientious and workmanlike manner, in accordance
with the applicable law, this JVA and generally accepted
standards of international Petroleum industry designed to
achieve efficient and safe development and production of
Petroleum and to maximize the ultimate economic recovery
of Petroleum from the JVA Area.”

One may argue that compliance with these laws and standards
has a contractual basis in the JVA. To this extent, a dispute
concerning compliance with these laws and standards may be
considered of a contractual nature in a wider sense. However,
the laws to which reference is made in Article 26.2.4 and other
applicable laws and regulations apply not just because they are
included in the Operator’s obligations under the JVA; but they
have a direct application. This application also may have to be
considered as connected to the performance of the JVA.

When the Respondents argue the contrary and assert that the
arbitration clause is limited to contractual disputes they do not
use the term contractual disputes in the wider sense just
mentioned. Rather they state that the rights invoked must
derive “from a contractual commitment” and not from “different
normative sources”.3°8 However, they do not explain on what
basis they seek to justify their position. In particular they do

358 R-CMJ.2 — Compensation Declaration, paragraph 27.

137

505.

506.

507.

508.

509.

not give any reason why claims “in connection with the
performance” of the JVA must by necessity be contractual
claims in the narrow sense in which the Respondents use the
term.

In view of this wide scope of Niko’s obligations under the JVA
and the difference in the origin of these obligations, extending
beyond specific prescriptions in the agreement itself, the
Tribunal understands disputes “in connection with the
performance” of the JVA in a wider sense, which may include
sources of liability other than the agreement itself. The
question what these sources are and which obligations,
contractual or other, fall to be considered concerns the
substance of the dispute and is not determined at this stage of
the arbitration.

The Tribunal concludes that it may well be possible that it can
make findings concerning liability on grounds other than the
JVA. A more precise determination depends on an analysis of
the claim made. This will be undertaken when the Tribunal
considers the merits of the dispute.

10.3 Jurisdiction ratione personae

The Claimant argues that not only BAPEX but also Petrobangla
and Bangladesh are party to the JVA and that, for this reason,
the Tribunal has jurisdiction with respect to JVA claims also
against Petrobangla and Bangladesh.#39

The Respondents contest that Petrobangla and Bangladesh are
party to this agreement. Claims based on the JVA therefore
cannot be brought against these two Respondents.*4°

Petrobangla and Bangladesh are not named as party to the JVA
and have not signed this agreement. The Tribunal has
explained above the reasons why it does not accept jurisdiction
over Bangladesh. The remaining question is whether it has
jurisdiction over Petrobangla in respect of claims under the JVA.

514.

 

The arguments of the Claimant in support of its position that
Petrobangla is a party to the JVA and that jurisdiction with
respect to JVA claims should extend to it are largely similar if
not identical to those concerning jurisdiction over Bangladesh.

The Claimant argues that “BAPEX acted on behalf of both the
other Respondents in making the JVA. All the other Respondents
are parties to the agreement’. It adds that “the Respondents,
each of whom had a role in the making of the JVA by approving
it, did not appear to give any weight to their supposed separate
identities when approving the JVA commitments to the foreign
investor about tax concession, priority on Petrobangla’s delivery
system, and the price and sales specifications of the gas. The
necessary and proper implication from the facts is that the parties
necessary to give effect to these promises, which include
Petrobangla, intended to be bound to the JVA”.54!

The Tribunal has decided that, in the circumstances of this
case, the distinct legal personality of BAPEX and Petrobangla
and their status of agencies of the Government, designated as
such to ICSID, must be respected. The JVA itself clearly
distinguishes between the three entities, specifying that BAPEX
is a “wholly owned Company” of Petrobangla which in turn is
“wholly owned and established” by the Government. The
Preamble states that “BAPEX warrants that it has acquired from
Petrobangla and the Government the requisite approvals to
execute this JVA”.

The Claimant argues that the Respondents “have not adequately
explained the source of Bapex’s rights to grant Niko rights to
conduct broadly defined Petroleum Operations over the gas fields
owned by Bangladesh, and purportedly subject to various
authority of Petrobangla’.3*? It adds that the Respondents did
not adequately explain how BAPEX could grant such rights to
Niko. It concludes that “the common sense explanation is that
Bapex acted on behalf of both the other Respondents in making
the JVA”.

The question whether BAPEX did indeed have the rights on
which some of the provisions of the JVA depend is not a matter

°-MJ.3, p. 11

+ C_MJ.3, paragraph 23.

139

516.

517.

518.

of jurisdiction. If the matter became controversial (which at
present does not seem to be the case), it would have to be
addressed in the next phase of this arbitration.

The Tribunal concludes that it has not seen any argument to
justify treating Petrobangla with respect to the JVA any different
than it treated Bangladesh with respect to both agreements.
Petrobangla is not party to the JVA and therefore the Tribunal
has no jurisdiction over Petrobangla with respect to claims
based on the JVA.

10.4 Impact on legal interests of third parties

The Respondents refer to the Compensation Claim brought by
Petrobangla and the Ministry of Energy against the Claimant in
a court in Bangladesh. They argue that “a finding in the
Claimant’s favour concerning responsibility over the blowouts
would inevitably impact on the rights of Petrobangla, the Ministry
of Energy and the citizens of Bangladesh, over all of whom this
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the JVA”.543 They add that the
“relief sought by the Claimant will undoubtedly affect the legal
rights of Petrobangla, Bangladesh, and private third parties and
is, therefore, not within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.”344

The Claimant contest this argument with respect to Petrobangla
and Bangladesh since, in its view, these two Respondents are
not “third parties” to the JVA. The Claimant also denies that any
“private third parties” are affected.

The Tribunal is aware that Petrobangla and Bangladesh,
represented by the Secretary, Ministry of Energy & Mineral
Resources, are claiming in a court of Bangladesh damages from
Niko arising from the blowouts.345 It may well be that,
although, as a result of the Tribunal’s findings in section 10.3
above, there is no identity of parties between these disputes,
this is nevertheless an overlap in subject-matter between these
claims. Whether and to what extent any findings in one
tribunal are relevant to the proceedings in the other is a matter
that may have to be considered at the merits stage.

“4 R-CMJ.2 — Compensation Declaration, paragraph 32.
5 The claims have been presented in the Money Suit, produced as RfA I, Attachment F.

519. The Respondents nevertheless go further and argue that such
an impact would be contrary to the principle in international
law according to which “an international tribunal should refuse
to exercise its jurisdiction over a dispute between the parties
before it if the subject matter of the decision would determine the
legal interests of non-parties to the dispute” .34©

520. The Respondents find support for this principle in the
Judgment of the International Court of Justice in the Monetary
Gold*7 case and a PCA Award.348 Yet the principle applied in
the Monetary Gold case, in the words of the ICJ, did not relate to
the determination of “legal interests of non-parties”, but was a
case where the Court would have had to “adjudicate upon the
international responsibility” of a State which had not consented
to such adjudication.

521. In the present case the Tribunal is not called upon to adjudicate
upon the responsibility of Petrobangla and Bangladesh. Its task
is rather to determine the rights and duties of Niko and BAPEX
in connection with the performance of the JVA. However, in the
course of such a determination, it may have to consider issues
in matters which Petrobangla and Bangladesh have assigned to
BAPEX.

522. As the Claimant points out, the Bangladesh and Petrobangla
have assigned to BAPEX rights and obligations which otherwise
are theirs. This can be seen in the terms of some provisions of
the JVA which was concluded with the express approval of the
Government of Bangladesh. The assignment has been recorded
in very clear terms in paragraph 14 of the JVA Preamble. There
BAPEX warrants that it has the necessary approvals and then
continues:

“The responsibilities and obligations of Petrobangla and the
Government in all relevant Articles, Annexes and
Amendments under this JVA has been assign [sic] to
BAPEX.”

Given this assignment, the Tribunal, when addressing the
merits of the claim for a Compensation Declaration, may well
have to deal with responsibilities and obligations which
otherwise are those of the Government and Petrobangla and
which have been assigned to BAPEX in the context of the JVA.
Whether such decisions have to be made, again, is a matter of
the merits. Even if such decisions do have to be made, that
would not make this a case in which the Tribunal assumes
jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the responsibility of third
parties. Rather, its task would be to determine responsibilities
and obligations assigned to BAPEX, a party to the JVA and as
such subject to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

As far as the people of Bangladesh or private third parties are
concerned the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction, and therefore
has no intention to adjudicate any claims they may have.

10.5 BAPEX cooperation with respect to the GPSA claims
(the Cooperation Claim)

The Cooperation Claim, as defined above, concerns an
obligation of BAPEX to cooperate with the Claimant in
commencing arbitration against Petrobangla under the GPSA
and in terminating that agreement. The Claimant bases this
claim on the JVA.

The Respondents deny that the Government has an obligation
“to force Bapex to cooperate”.349 The question whether the
Government has such an obligation is not relevant here since
the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate with respect to it.

The Respondents also deny that BAPEX has a duty to cooperate
in collecting amounts due under the JVA or in terminating the
JVA in the event of non-payment. They argue that the Claimant
has not provided a sufficient basis for such a claim. But they
do not deny that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine it.

The question whether BAPEX, a party to the JVA, owes a duty
under the JVA to cooperate in the sense described, to Niko,
another party to the JVA, clearly concerns a dispute “arising in

*° R-CMJ.2 — Compensation Declaration, paragraph 25.

142

connection with the performance or interpretation of any provision
of this JVA’. This Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
Cooperation Claim.

11. JURISDICTION WITH RESPECT TO CLAIM UNDER THE
GPSA (THE PAYMENT CLAIM)

11.1 The Position of the Parties

529. In ARB/10/18, the Claimant seeks “to resolve all claims to
payment under the GPSA and to recover payment of amounts due
for gas delivered” .°°° It argues that under the GPSA Petrobangla
owes to Niko and BAPEX US$27.16 million and US$8.55
million, respectively.35! It presents two versions of the claim: in
one version Niko seeks to “recover the amounts owing to Niko”
and the other version, pursued alternatively, the Claimant seeks
“payment for both Niko and Bapex’.*5?, The Claimant adds that
“(blecause Bapex refused to cooperate in the arbitration, Niko
joined Bapex as a Respondent to this arbitration” 353

530. The Respondents object that the Claimant’s payment claim “by
itself or on behalf of BAPEX should be rejected and this Tribunal
should not assume jurisdiction over it’.54 They argue that the
Claimant cannot act alone as “the sole voice and representative
of the partnership (Niko-BAPEX)”. Relying on the award in the
Impregilo arbitration, the Respondents argue that “one member
of a partnership or joint venture, may not claim for the entire loss
suffered by the corporate entity or group”. The Respondents
further argue that an award for payment under the GPSA would
also benefit BAPEX, and that by making such an award, the
“Tribunal would effectively be giving investment protection to a
national of Bangladesh” .355

531. The Claimant responds that “Niko’s request to arbitrate included
determination of the net amount owed to Niko, or alternatively,
the Seller under the GPSA”. BAPEX would not necessarily be
“co-beneficiary” of a monetary award, since Niko’s and BAPEX’
shares would be calculated and paid separately under the
GPSA. It added: “While Bapex might incidentally benefit from
such an award, the determinative factor favouring jurisdiction is

that the remedy was sought by and will be awarded to the
foreign investor.”35°©

The issues to be considered here concern (i) the question
whether Petrobangla agreed to arbitrate with the two Joint
Venture Partners or with the Joint Venture as such and (ii) if it
is the Joint Venture Partners, whether they have to act jointly
rather than each partner being able to act individually.

11.2 Has Petrobangla agreed to arbitrate with Niko?

At this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal need not decide
whether the claim should be rejected in one or both of its
versions but whether it has jurisdiction to make a decision on
granting or rejecting the claim.

For this decision on jurisdiction the Tribunal must take as the
starting point the fact that, in Article 13 of the GPSA,
Petrobangla agreed to ICSID arbitration of “any dispute arising
in connection with the performance or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement’. The Claimant pursues claims for
determining the amounts owed under the GPSA and claims “to
recover payment of amounts due for gas delivered”.357 Such
claims clearly are connected to the performance of the GPSA.
Subject matter jurisdiction for the claims cannot be at issue and
has not been questioned by the Respondents.

As explained above, the requirements specific to the ICSID
Convention have been met. The remaining question is with
whom Petrobangla agreed to arbitrate.

The title page of the GPSA identifies as the parties Petrobangla,
as the “Buyer”, and the “Joint Venture Partners Bangladesh
Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited (BAPEX)
and Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd.”, as the Seller”. It
deserves to be noted that here it is not the Joint Venture as
such which is identified as the Seller but the “Joint Venture
Partners”. This expression is repeated on the opening page on
which the parties are presented in greater detail. There the

presentation of the Seller commences again by the expression
“Joint Venture Partners”, Niko and BAPEX, and concludes by
stating “BAPEX-NIKO jointly hereinafter referred to as the
‘Seller’, of THE OTHER PART”.

On the signature page, BAPEX and Niko signed each for itself
with no reference to a joint venture or even the Seller.

The Tribunal concludes that in the GPSA the expression “Seller”
does not identify a distinct entity, but is used to refer
collectively to two of the parties to the Agreement.

This conclusion is not affected by the definition of the “Seller” in
Article 1.13. This definition refers to the “BAPEX-NIKO Joint
Venture”; but continues by stating “as described in the Preamble
of this Agreement’. In other words, the Seller is understood as
the two “Joint Venture Partners” identified in the preamble,
BAPEX and Niko.

The Respondents state that the “Seller has no legal personality
under Bangladesh law and is not a juridical person under Article
25 of the ICSID Convention”.358 The Tribunal agrees. However,
the observation does not contradict the conclusion reached by
the Tribunal; to the contrary, it confirms that the arbitration
clause applies to the two Partners individually and not to an
entity distinct from them.

Since the GPSA and with it the arbitration clause apply to the
two Partners individually, the Tribunal accepts that Petrobangla
has agreed to arbitrate with Niko GPSA disputes as defined in
Article 13 of that agreement.

The remaining question is whether the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is
limited to cases in which Niko acts jointly with BAPEX.

11.3 Is Niko precluded as a matter of principle to claim for
both Joint Venture Partners?

The Respondents object to the claim made by Niko “on behalf of
itself and BAPEX as the Seller’. They refer to the decision on

358 R-CMJ.1, paragraph 98.

146

544.

545.

546.

jurisdiction of 22 April 2005 by an ICSID tribunal559 in the case
of Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan.36° In
particular, they rely on a principle stated in that decision in the
following terms:

“Indeed, there is an established principle of international
law that a shareholder of a company, or one member of a
partnership or joint venture, may not claim for the entire
loss suffered by the corporate entity or group.”3®!

The Tribunal has considered this statement in the context of the
case in which it was made. In that case Impregilo had acted as
the Leader of a Joint Venture formed under Swiss law (GBC)
and, in this function as the Leader, concluded two contracts
with a Pakistani authority. It brought the action against
Pakistan under the BIT between Pakistan and Italy, stating that
it was acting on its own behalf and on behalf of the Joint
Venture and the other joint venture members, which were
nationals of Germany and of Pakistan.362

The arbitral tribunal in the Impregilo case concluded that it had
“no jurisdiction in respect of claims on behalf of, or losses
incurred by, either GBC itself, or any of Impregilo’s joint venture
partners”. It found that its conclusion was “in line with a
number of decisions of ICSID tribunals, as well as other
international courts and arbitral tribunals”. It continued by the
passage just quoted.

The question whether a joint venture partner is entitled to claim
for the entire loss suffered by the joint venture is essentially a
matter concerning the substance of the dispute. It does,
however, have implications with respect to subject matter
jurisdiction. The Tribunal is of the view that the question
whether the claim to payment for the gas is a claim to which the
Joint Venture Partners are entitled individually or jointly should
be considered in the proceedings on the merits. It does,
however, believe that it should not proceed with the merits on

that claim if it is apparent from the case made in this phase of
the proceedings that a claim by Niko alone cannot succeed.

When considering the quoted passage from the Impregilo award,
it must be borne in mind that the tribunal there considered
claims under the Pakistan/Italy BIT. The tribunal found that
treaty did not extend to claims by nationals other than those of
Italy: under that treaty Pakistan had not accepted to arbitrate
claims by German or Swiss entities, nor any claims of Pakistani
entities.

In the present case the arbitration is based not on a treaty but
on a contract subject to the law of Bangladesh. The
jurisdictional requirements under the ICSID Convention are
governed by public international law, which does not, however,
necessarily apply to the question of entitlement to contractual
claims and to their pursuit in an arbitration. The Tribunal
therefore must turn to the GPSA, as the contract which governs
the relations between the Buyer and the Seller, and the JVA,
which regulates the relations between the Joint Venture
Partners referred to as the Seller.

11.4 The position under the agreements

Neither the JVA nor the GPSA deal expressly with the question
of how the Joint Venture Partners must act with respect to the
rights of “the Seller”. They do not provide expressly that one of
the Joint Venture Partners may act for both Partners, nor do
they contain a provision that requires joint action or joint
liability.

The JVA identifies Niko as the “Operator” and states in its
preamble that “BAPEX and OPERATOR mutually agree to enter
into this JVA with respect to the JVA Area and form a joint
venture on the basis of and to implement this JVA for petroleum
operations”. Article 2 of the JVA is entitled “JVA Scope” and
defines the object of the Joint Venture:

“This is a Joint Venture Agreement, the object of which is
the Development and Production of Petroleum from the
Marginal/Abandoned gas fields Chattak and Feni as
specified in Article 3 at OPERATOR’s sole risk and expense.

148

551.

552.

553.

554.

All actions taken and operations conducted shall be in
consideration to the requirement and applicability of such
operation for a Marginal/ Abandoned field.”

The JVA does not provide that the Joint Venture has separate
personality, nor does it contain any provision indicating that an
entity distinct from that of the Parties is being formed. Nor does
it contain any provision on the manner in which the joint
venture must act or be represented.

The JVA does, however, provide in Article 6.1 for a Joint
Management Committee (JMC) composed of six members, three
from each party. Article 6.1 provides that JMC has to take its
decisions unanimously and contains a procedure for “the event
of not reaching a unanimous decision”. It also defines the
matters with respect to which the parties shall meet and “take
appropriate decisions”. In addition to the matters listed there,
the JVA also contains a large number of other provisions which
allocate tasks and responsibilities to one or the other of the
parties. Some obligations are assigned to BAPEX, in particular
that of assistance and cooperation with respect to matters in
Bangladesh and “relevant Government Ministries, Departments
and Agencies”. The bulk of the obligations, however, are
assigned to Niko as the Operator.

The Tribunal sees in these provisions a confirmation of the
conclusion which it reached when examining the GPSA and the
meaning of the term “Seller” in that agreement: the Joint
Venture is not an entity separate from the contracting parties
with distinct legal personality; rather it is a contract for the
cooperation of the two parties.

With respect for this cooperation, the JVA does, however,
provide for some joint activities. In particular, Article 6.2.2
provides:

“A Joint Bank Account is to be opened in Bangladesh and
operated jointly by the representatives of the Operator &
BAPEX for receiving sales proceeds and _ making
distribution to the Parties according to their respective
Share as per Article 23.3 of the JVA.”

149

555.

556.

557.

558.

559.

Article 24.3 of the JVA provides for the sale of the gas produced
as the result of the action of the Joint Venture Partners and in
particular of the Operator. Article 24.3 does so at two levels. The
first level follows from the principle according to which
“OPERATOR and BAPEX (hereinafter referred to as SELLER)
agree to sell the produced Petroleum to the Bangladesh domestic
market under this JVA”. This principle is adopted as a joint
decision. The Buyer for the gas at this stage is identified as
Petrobangla or a designee. If Petrobangla does not provide a
“market outlet” within six months, Article 24.3 provides that
“OPERATOR shall be free to find a market outlet within the
Country ...”. In other words, the decision on the principle is
taken jointly; subsequent action may be taken individually by
the Operator.

Similarly, the agreement that the gas produced must be sold in
Bangladesh is adopted as a joint decision. However, there is no
provision that regulates the action concerning the
implementation of this decision of principle, except that the
search for other market outlets is left to Niko as the Operator.

Apart from the subject matters which require decisions by the
JMC, the JVA allocates a wide range of tasks and obligations to
Niko as the Operator. Some of these are set out in Article 25,
entitled “Rights and Obligations of Operator”. Further tasks
and obligations are set out in other parts of the JVA. For
instance the Operator prepares the Work Programme (Article
6.2), procures equipment, material and services (Article 6.2.1.2),
prepares the tax returns (Article 11.5), maintains the books and
accounts concerning the operations under the JV (Article 12.1
and 14.1).

Article 26.1.4 is a general clause. It provides that “for the
efficient conduct of Petroleum Operation” the Operator shall have

the right ...:

“To undertake all Petroleum Operations pertaining to the
JVA and the Petroleum produced there from’.

According to Article 1.47

150

560.

561.

562.

563.

“Petroleum Operations’ means all operations of
Development and Production and all other operations
pertaining to Petroleum as provided for in this JVA.”

In view of this definition of Petroleum Operations, and in
particular the reference to “other operations pertaining to
Petroleum as provided for in this JVA”, measures relating to the
sale of the gas produced and to the collection of invoices for
such sales may well be included in these powers.

It seems to result from the evidence produced that, in practice,
invoices for the gas were issued by Niko. BAPEX objected to
these invoices. However, the objection seemed to have related to
the fact that, at least initially, Niko invoiced for its share only,
not for the full amount of the payments due to the Seller. In its
letter of 11 December 2005, BAPEX wrote to Niko complaining
that:

“... you have been sending Invoices to Petrobangla for
payment of 80% share of NIKO to Niko’s Bank Account
which is in clear violation of Clause No. 6.2.2 of Joint
Venture Agreement (JVA) executed between BAPEX and
NIKO. ..”368

The letter concludes:

“In view of the foregoing, we would again like to bring to
your notice that in order to keep everything in conformity
with JVA we stand firm to our earlier views and would
appreciate that from now onward NIKO will submit invoice
to Petrobangla as per article 6.2.2 of the JVA for Gas sales
from Feni Gas Field and also refrain itself from submitting
invoice to Petrobangla for its share only.”

One must conclude from this passage that, at that time, BAPEX
was of the view that Niko was entitled to issue invoices for the
payment for the gas but had to do so for the full amount due to
both Joint Venture Partners.

A similar conclusion seems to flow from some of the
correspondence in the file of documents produced in the

$6 Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 377.

151

arbitration. It appears from these documents that the
correspondence with Petrobangla was sent by Niko “on behalf of
the Bapex/Niko Joint Venture’3°+ or “on behalf of our partner
Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Co. Ltd. (Bapex)
and as the Operator of the Bapex/ Niko Joint Venture ...”.3°5 This
latter formula was even used in the “Notice of Default” which
Niko addressed to Petrobangla on 30 September 2007.36 On 25
October 2009 Niko, “as the operator of the Feni Gas Field and on
behalf of the JV partners requests Petrobangla to temporarily
suspend the Feni GSPA till litigation and other issues relating to
outstanding and future payments are resolved” .367

All of these communications were copied to BAPEX. There
appears to have been no protest by Petrobangla or by BAPEX
against Niko acting on behalf of the Joint Venture Partners. In
turn, letters expressly referencing the Feni GPSA were
addressed by Petrobangla not to the Joint Venture or to the
Joint Venture Partners but to Niko alone, with a copy to
BAPEX.368

The Tribunal concludes that it may well be that both BAPEX, as
the other Joint Venture Partner, and Petrobangla, as the Buyer
under the GPSA, accepted that Niko could act on behalf of the
Joint Venture or of both Joint Venture Partners.

However, this conclusion seems to be contradicted by other
evidence. In particular, the Tribunal notes that at the JMC
meeting of 25 March 2008, Niko proposed a resolution recorded
in the Minutes in the following terms:

“That arbitration under the GPSA immediately be
commenced for recovery of outstanding amounts and
amounts invoiced in future under the GPSA, and that Niko
and Bapex take all reasonable steps to move the
arbitration to conclusion as quickly as possible.”3°9

The Minutes record the position of BAPEX as follows:

*” Tid.

“At this point of time Bapex opines that no material gain
will result from this arbitration. Bapex feels that there could
be a solution in the near future that is more beneficial for
all.”370

No agreement seems to have been reached between the Joint
Venture Partners on commencing this action. The Claimant
explained in RfA II that, “[b]ecause Bapex refused to cooperate in
the arbitration, Niko joined Bapex as a Respondent to this
arbitration” 371

At this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal need not decide
whether the JVA and the GPSA, in the understanding of the
Parties, as reflected in the quoted correspondence, allowed Niko
to act for both Joint Venture Partners and pursue the claim it
alleges to have against Petrobangla or whether, as reflected in
the proposed JMC resolution, consent of BAPEX is required.
The Tribunal simply notes that, in view of the agreements
concluded and the conduct of the Parties in respect of them, it
cannot be excluded that Niko, acting alone as Claimant, may
pursue claims for payment under the GPSA.

In the proceedings on the merits the Tribunal will have to decide
whether Niko is entitled to claim payment under the GPSA and,
if so, whether it may claim payment of the full amount due to
the Seller or only of its own share.

At that occasion the Tribunal may also have to decide whether,
in order to make such claims, Niko needs the consent of BAPEX
and, if that consent were required but not given, whether Niko
would be entitled to request from this Tribunal a decision by
which BAPEX is ordered to give its consent or which replaces
such consent. It may then have to decide on the effect of the
joinder of BAPEX to the proceedings against Petrobangla.

Finally, the Tribunal has considered the Respondents’ objection
concerning the possible effects for BAPEX in case Niko’s claim
for payment under the GPSA would be awarded. If the Tribunal
were to decide that Petrobangla must make payments under the
GPSA to the Seller, such a decision would also favour BAPEX.

57. RFA II, paragraph 6.26.

153

573.

574.

The Respondents argue that, by such a decision, “the Tribunal
would effectively be giving investment protection to a national of
Bangladesh”. According to the Respondents, such an award
“would be contrary to the purpose of the ICSID Convention and
requirements of Article 25” .372

The Convention and its Article 25 provide for arbitration
between a Contracting State and a national of another
Contracting State. For the reasons explained, these
requirements are met. Neither Article 25 of the Convention nor
the “purpose of the Convention” excludes that an award in
favour of a foreign national also benefits nationals of the
defendant Contracting State. The Tribunal sees no grounds on
which the Convention should make such an exclusion and the
Respondents do not indicate any. The objection must be
rejected.

In conclusion, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on claims
made by Niko against Petrobangla. It reserves its decision
about the question whether such claims, if they exist, must be
made for the Joint Venture Partners jointly or for Niko alone; it
also reserves the decision concerning the position of BAPEX in
the proceedings concerning the GPSA.
