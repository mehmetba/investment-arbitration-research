Re: Spence International Investments, LLC, Berkowitz et al v. the Republic of Costa Rica
(UNCT/13/2)

Dear Mesdames and Sirs,

Please find attached the English and Spanish versions of the Tribunal’s Interim Award

dated 25 October 2016.

The Tribunal, noting the heavy factual detail of this case, and recalling Article 38 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (as revised in 2010), invites the parties to draw its attention to
“any error in computation, any clerical or typographical error, or any error or omission of a
similar nature” within 30 days of receipt of the Interim Award so the Tribunal can consider

whether any correction is appropriate.

Finally, in the light of the Interim Award, the parties are invited to confer with a view to
seeing whether they can reach agreement on the next steps to be taken on the issues that remain
outstanding, failing which the Tribunal will propose a Procedural Order to address next steps for
the parties’ consideration. In case it may assist the parties’ consideration of the issues, the
Tribunal is presently minded to schedule a single round of sequential pleadings to address the
outstanding issues, with reply / rejoinder submissions being deferred to a hearing to be scheduled
in due course. If, however, the parties consider that two rounds of written pleadings, or a single
round of simultaneous pleadings, or indeed any other format, would be preferable, the Tribunal
would be pleased to consider this.

The parties are requested to report back to the Tribunal on this matter by no later than
November 30, 2016.

Yours sincerely,
[signed]

Anneliese Fleckenstein
Secretary of the Tribunal
