INTRODUCTION

1.

This Decision addresses Estonia’s Application for Provisional Measures dated 26
February 2016 (“Application”).

Approximately one month earlier, on 27 January 2016, Estonia filed an Application for
an Immediate Procedural Order Prohibiting Publication of any Arbitration Material
(‘January Application”). In the January Application, Respondent requested that the
Tribunal:

(a) issue an urgent procedural order prohibiting publication of [certain excerpts of
Claimants’ Memorial (referred to by the parties respectively as the “Excerpts” and
the “Extract”)] or any other arbitration material by the Parties, directly or indirectly
through any third parties, until the Tribunal’s decision on Estonia’s request for
preliminary measures;

(b) grant leave for Estonia to file a request for provisional measures prohibiting
publication of the Excerpts or any other arbitration material (unless such material
is already in the public domain) by Friday 26 February 2016; and

(c) invite the Parties to agree on further briefing schedule regarding Estonia’s
request for provisional measures by Friday 19 February 2016."

Respondent argued that Claimants’ “unilateral decision” to publish the Extract on
Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi (ASTV)’s website shortly prior to Respondent's filing of its
Counter-Memorial had “no legitimate basis,"* was designed to offer a “one-sided
picture of the dispute” and “distract” Estonia from its filing preparations, and had the
effect of exacerbating the dispute by turning this arbitration into a trial by media.®
Respondent also proposed to file its proposed Request for Provisional Measures on 26
February 2016.

By letter of 28 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the parties that it intended to
decide the January Application by no later than 29 January 2016 and invited Claimants
to respond to the January Application by no later than noon (ET) on 29 January 2016.
The parties were informed that the Tribunal expected Claimants to refrain from all
further publication or dissemination of materials related to the arbitration until such time
as the Tribunal determined the questions raised in the January Application.

By letter of 29 January 2016, Claimants filed their response to the January Application,
including a proposal for a solution pending the filing of a request for provisional
measures by Respondent.

6.

By letter of the same date, the Tribunal invited the parties to communicate directly with
each other regarding Claimants’ proposal, with a view hopefully to reaching agreement
on a solution to be proposed to the Tribunal. The Tribunal also requested Respondent
to inform the Tribunal of the outcome of such discussions, including any agreement
reached or, if necessary, its reply to Claimants’ proposal, by 30 January 2016.

By email of 30 January 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that the parties had
come to the following agreement, which would apply pending the Tribunal's
consideration of Respondent's full request for provisional measures to be filed on 26
February 2016:

1. Neither Party shall publish the Memorial, the Counter-Memorial, any witness
statement, or any expert report that have been or will be filed in this arbitration, or
any summary, excerpt or extract thereof.

2. Each Party may publish a stock exchange announcement or press release, or
make public statements regarding the filing of the Memorial or the Counter-
Memorial and the general position that Claimants claim violations of the Treaty
and Estonia denies Claimants’ claims in full. Such communications shall not
discuss the specific content of the Memorial or the Counter-Memorial or the
witness statements and expert reports attached thereto, or identify the witnesses
and experts. The Parties reserve the right to revisit this agreement with each other
and with the Tribunal in the event of material media coverage which goes beyond
the fact of the filing of the Memorial and Counter-Memorial and that Claimants
claim violations of the Treaty and Estonia denies Claimants’ claims in full, and
which either Party considers it should respond to.

By email of the same date, Claimants confirmed the parties’ agreement.

On 26 February 2016, as noted, Respondent filed its Application that is the subject of
the present Decision.

By letter of 16 March 2016, Claimants informed the Tribunal of the following agreement
between the parties as to the briefing schedule to address the Application:

1. The Claimants shall file their Response to the Application by Friday 18 March
2016 (the "Response");

2. By 22 March 2016, Estonia shall notify the Claimants and the Tribunal whether
it wishes to file a reply to the Response (the "Reply");

3. If Estonia opts to file a Reply, that Reply is to be filed by 1 April 2016, with the
Claimants' rejoinder to that Reply, if any, to be filed by 15 April 2016;

4. Thereafter, the Tribunal is respectfully requested to resolve the Application
without an oral hearing.

By email of 17 March 2016, Respondent confirmed the parties’ agreement regarding
the proposed briefing schedule.

By email of the same date, the Tribunal confirmed that the parties’ proposed briefing
schedule was accepted.

On 18 March 2016, in accordance with the agreed briefing schedule, Claimants filed
their Response to Estonia's Application (“Response”).

By letter of 22 March 2016, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it would file a reply
to the Response (“Reply”). Pursuant to the parties’ agreement, the Reply would be
filed by 1 April 2016 and Claimants’ rejoinder to that Reply by 15 April 2016
(‘Rejoinder’).

On 1 April 2016, Respondent filed its Reply.

On 15 April 2016, Claimants filed their Rejoinder.

PARTIES’ POSITIONS REGARDING THE APPLICATION
A. Respondent’s Position

(i) | Claimants have been waging an aggressive, one-sided media
campaign against the Estonian Government since the initiation of
this arbitration

Similar to the January Application, the Application concerns what Respondent
characterizes as “Claimants’ intended publication of selected excerpts of Claimants’
Memorial (the ‘Excerpts’) as set forth in Claimants’ letter dated 19 January 2016.”°
Respondent seeks to prevent such publication because, in its submission

[...] Claimants’ unilateral publication of the Excerpts or any other document filed in
this arbitration, such as the Parties’ written submissions, witness statements,
expert reports and documents produced within the framework of document
production (the “Arbitration Documents”), would aggravate an already
aggressive media campaign that Claimants have been conducting in Estonia for
several years. Such a trial by the media would inevitably exacerbate the dispute
and severely compromise Estonia’s right of due process.”

According to Respondent, Claimants have been waging a one-sided media campaign
since the beginning of this arbitration, “designed to convince the Estonian public that
Estonia is wrong and will lose the case”® by means of “unilateral disclosures to the
media [...].”° Estonia refers to the following examples of this campaign:

— on 19 June 2014, a leading online daily newspaper and news channel,
Delfi, reported on Claimants’ notice of dispute to Estonia and, according to

® Application, § 2.

7 Application, § 4 (emphasis in the original).

® Application, § 7.

° Application, § 15.

United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. et a/. v. Republic of Estonia Decision on Provisional Measures
(ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24)

Respondent, “gave a remarkably pro-Claimants—and inaccurate—picture of
the dispute [...]”;'°

— on 24 July 2014, another online newspaper, Postimees, incorrectly
suggested that the opinions provided by independent experts in the context of
a domestic lawsuit brought by ASTV supported the latter's position;"!

— on 14 October 2014, Postimees reported that Claimants had initiated
international arbitration proceedings against Estonia, and offered only
Claimants’ point of view as to the dispute;'? and

— on 13 November 2014, Mr. Kaur Kender published on Nihilist.fm what
Respondent calls “an open piece of propaganda”!? in favour of Claimants,
which Respondent also criticizes for its “inflammatory call for personal liability
of those who have caused Estonia’s alleged loss of reputation as well as for
the predicted future loss in this arbitration.”'4 According to Estonia, such “pro-
Claimant rhetoric”'® is anything but “balanced and constructive,”'® contrary to
Claimants’ pretensions in this regard.

19. Respondent describes these articles as “the tip of the iceberg.”’’ It says that many
more such articles were published even before the commencement of this arbitration.
Respondent cites as examples an article from the Estonian daily newspaper Eesti
Paevaleht of 6 May 2011'8 and ASTV’s press releases of 26 September 2011 and 13

February 2013.'9 Estonia argues that Claimants have “actively incited and nourished"
this anti-government media campaign, as revealed by the simultaneous publication of
ASTV's 14 October 2014 press release and three articles in the Estonian press, for the
preparation of which Claimants provided the relevant information.2' Further, far from
being “necessary and legitimate’? updates to its shareholders, ASTV's stock
exchange announcements merely offer Claimants’ one-sided view of the dispute.
Respondent takes the example of ASTV’s press release of 24 July 2014 regarding the
above-referred statements of experts in the Estonian court proceedings, as well as
press releases of 5 May 2014 and 7 January 2015.” While Estonian law requires that
listed companies “disclose information on the key factual milestones relating to the
proceedings,”* it does not require, in Respondent's view, publication of one-sided
documents such as the Excerpts.

20. Respondent argues that the Tribunal has already rejected Claimants’ effort to have the
case effectively made public. Respondent recalls that, after having heard the parties,
the Tribunal decided in its Procedural Order No. 1 that “[t]he parties consent to ICSID
publication of any Procedural Orders, Decisions, and Award issued in the present
proceeding, subject to the redaction of confidential information.”?° In Respondent's
submission, Claimants are now seeking to achieve what they failed to obtain from the
Tribunal by way of unilateral disclosures to the media.?”

21. Respondent further submits that after Procedural Order No. 1 was issued, Claimants
expressed the view that paragraph 23.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 applied only to
ICSID and placed no restriction on publication of submissions by the parties, “subject
to the redaction of confidential information and provided that publication is undertaken
in a manner compatible with efficient conduct of the arbitration.” In Respondent's

view, Claimants’ distinction between publication by ICSID and publication by the
parties is “purely formalistic”?® and would deprive of any meaning the requirement of
party consent to publication under the ICSID Convention. °° In subsequent
correspondence, Respondent argues that it opposed (and opposes) unilateral
publication for the following reasons:

a. Claimants’ unilateral publication of any of Estonia’s documents without
Estonia's express consent would nullify the principle of confidentiality under ICSID
rules, which expressly require the consent of both Parties to publication;

b. The publication would jeopardize integrity of proceedings and Estonia's due
process rights. This is because the dispute involved a number of highly sensitive
political issues and was already subject to intense media scrutiny, including
comments on both Parties’ chances in the dispute. Publication of Estonia's
submissions would spark further media attention and could be used as a means to
craft and harvest new evidence; and

c. The publication would expose Estonia’s potential and actual witnesses and
experts to considerable media pressures—which would severely compromise
Estonia’s very right to defense.°"

When, after two months of silence and shortly before Respondent was due to file its
Counter-Memorial, Claimants suddenly informed Estonia that they intended to publish
the Excerpts, the “true motives” behind the announced disclosures were revealed,
says Respondent, namely, “to distract Estonia in the last days of its most intense work
on the Counter-Memorial [...].”2

According to Estonia, Claimants falsely allege that their intended disclosure is confined
to “a summary of [their] claim and an explanation of how Estonia's actions constitute a
breach of the BIT.” In fact, “the Excerpts is an entirely one-sided and conclusory
piece of advocacy and [...] Claimants intend to publish much more.” *4 Indeed,
according to Respondent, while Claimants are currently seeking to publish the
Excerpts, they insist on a broader right to publish many of the Arbitration Documents.°°

Contrary to Claimants’ allegation, their media campaign cannot be considered a
response to any similar media campaign by Estonia — the evidence of such a
campaign being comprised of nothing more than “public criticism by private individuals
and entities who opposed ASTV’s excessive tariffs."°° The conduct of the Estonian

Home Owners Association (“EOKL”), an “independent organization”, cannot be
attributed to Respondent.%” In any event, the conduct complained of by Claimants,
which allegedly occurred in 2009 and 2010, predates this arbitration and bears no
relevance to the matter addressed in Estonia’s Application.°* Similarly, the publication
of a press release on 14 January 2016 which reiterated the contents of confidential
internal government document improperly leaked to Postimees and published on 6
January 2016, cannot be considered a media campaign.*° In any event, the release
merely confirmed the allocation of additional funds to cover Estonia’s costs in the
arbitration, which Respondent rightly anticipated would increase as a consequence of
Claimants’ unrelenting media campaign.*°

(ii) |The Application satisfies the requirements of Article 47 of the ICSID
Convention

25. Respondent submits that its Application satisfies the following four requirements
specified in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention in order for a tribunal to order
provisional measures:

a. prima facie jurisdiction of the Tribunal;

b. prima facie existence of a right susceptible of protection;
c. necessity of the measure requested; and

d. urgency of the measure requested.*'

26. According to Respondent, these requirements are all satisfied in this case. So is the
requirement of proportionality upon which Claimants insist in their submissions.42

(a) Prima facie jurisdiction of the Tribunal

27. Respondent contends that the Tribunal has prima facie jurisdiction to decide on the
Application. As confirmed in Pey Casado v. Chile,*° the fact that Respondent has
raised jurisdictional objections does not deprive the Tribunal of its power to issue
provisional measures, prima facie jurisdiction being based here on “the consent

between Claimants and Estonia under the Treaty perfected when Claimants filed their
Request for Arbitration [...]."“4 Respondent notes that Claimants do not dispute that
this requirement is met.45

(b) Prima facie existence of a right susceptible of protection

28. Respondent submits that it seeks protection of its “vital procedural rights,”46 including
the right to due process and the right to the non-aggravation of the dispute,‘” which are
“self-standing rights”® subject to protection under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.
It is Estonia’s view that its due process rights include a right to a trial exclusively before
this Tribunal, rather than a “trial in the media” (or “trial by media”). Respondent insists
that tribunals have recognized that reporting and publishing Arbitration Documents can
threaten a party’s due process rights and the integrity of the proceedings by creating a
“misleading picture”? of the dispute in the media and thus a “parallel forum for the
resolution of [the] dispute.”®©° It may also create “external pressure on the parties,
witnesses, experts and other participants in the process.”°' In addition, it may
exacerbate the dispute, especially in this case since “the dispute is in part based on an
allegation that Estonia has already engaged in a ‘negative publicity campaign.” ©?
Contrary to Claimants’ position, cases show that tribunals grant provisional measures
to protect “purely procedural rights” and not only “rights which have an impact on the
underlying [substantive] dispute.”®°

29. Referring to Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, Lao Holdings v. Laos and Abaclat v. Argentina,
Respondent contends that ICSID tribunals have made it clear that unilateral publication
of pleadings, memorials, witness statements and expert reports must be restricted in
order to protect these procedural rights,°4 in particular so as to avoid publicising a
“misleading picture” or “impression” of the dispute.®° In Estonia’s view, Claimants’
argument that Biwater and Abaciat are distinguishable because the facts were different
is incorrect. That the facts may be different is “irrelevant” since the tribunal's analysis
of the law applicable to confidentiality and disclosure in those cases “did not depend
on the[ir] specific facts [...].”5°

30. According to Estonia, the other authorities on which Claimants rely are not germane to
the issue here®” and, in any event, support the Application.5® AMCO v. Indonesia,
World Duty Free v. Kenya, and Churchill v. Indonesia concern public discussion of a
case. Consistent with Respondent's position, they confirm that “any right to engage in
public discussions is not unlimited but is qualified most notably by the duty to act in
good faith and not to exacerbate the dispute.”®? In Respondent's view, “[...] it was only
because of the facts specific to each of these cases that the tribunals denied the
requests for provisional measures.”®°

31. Contrary to Claimants’ assertion, they “do not have an unfettered general right to
unilaterally publish the Arbitration Documents, whether their own or Estonia’s.”6' None
of the authorities put forward by Claimants support their view.°2

32. Estonia further argues that its Application is compatible with the requirements of
transparency. While unrestricted transparency cannot prevail over the integrity of the
proceedings and the parties’ due process rights, as recognized in Abaclat v.
Argentina,® transparency is guaranteed in this case by the publication of the Tribunal’s
Procedural Orders, Decision and Award, which offer a “balanced and objective picture
of the dispute.”°4 Claimants’ reliance on the City of Tallinn’s support for publication of
the Excerpts is misplaced, the City of Tallinn being one of ASTV’s shareholders and
thus naturally espousing Claimants’ views regardless of their merits. In addition, the
Application safeguards “the Parties’ right to engage in general public discussion of the
case,” bearing in mind that such public discussion is subject to limitations so as to
avoid exacerbating the dispute, as held by the tribunal in Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania.®”
These limitations include refraining from discussing the specific contents of
submissions, witness statements and expert reports, as well as avoiding the
identification of witnesses and experts. ® Respondent thus makes the following
proposal:

[...] both Parties may issue stock exchange announcements or press releases, or
make general public statements regarding the filing of any submissions, the
hearing and/or the issuance of the award, provided that such communications do
not discuss the substance of the case beyond stating the general position that
Claimants claim violations of the Treaty and Estonia denies Claimants’ claims in
full. Specifically, the Parties’ communications shall not discuss the specific content
of any submissions or the witness statements and expert reports attached thereto,
or identify the witnesses and experts, including by disclosing any general or
anonymized information that would allow their identification.

(c) Necessity of the measure requested

33. The necessity requirement is also met in this case, says Estonia. According to
Respondent, “the mere likelihood of future exacerbation of the dispute or procedural
unfairness is sufficient for the Tribunal’s intervention in the interest of safeguarding the

orderly conduct of arbitration.”’° In this case, publication of the Excerpts and other
Arbitration Documents will (i) put “enormous media pressure””! on the Estonian
government to comment on the arbitration, (ii) lead to a discussion in the media of the
specific issues to be decided in the arbitration and (iii) result in the misuse of such
arguments to fuel a political debate in Estonia.’ Respondent denies that the
information contained in the Excerpts is already in the public domain; and even if it
were, the Application is not limited to publication of the Excerpts.’° In any case,
Claimants do not explain how the information that they seek to disclose would already
be public.” According to Respondent, it cannot have been made public through the
Estonian courts, which in any event are hearing claims under Estonian law, not BIT
claims.’5

Referring to the Biwater and Abaclat cases,’° Respondent concludes that restrictions
on publication of the Excerpts and other Arbitration Documents are therefore
necessary to

[p]rotect Estonia's vital rights of due process [...], the right not to have the dispute
exacerbated{,] [...] the right to protect the integrity of these proceedings[,] [and] to
prevent external pressure on Estonia, its representatives, witnesses, and experts
and to avoid the kind of “trial by the media” that Claimants have been seeking to
impose [...].””

As to the proportionality requirement raised by Claimants in their submissions,
Respondent argues that the so-called “balance of inconvenience” invariably tips toward
Respondent because Claimants have no right to publish the Arbitration Documents,
are under no legal obligation to publish the Arbitration Documents’® and thus “will
suffer no harm if the Application is granted.””9

(d) Urgency of the measure requested

The measures sought in the Application are urgent. Estonia emphasizes that, as noted
above in the Introduction to the present Decision, the parties’ interim agreement
regarding publication remains in place only until the Tribunal rules on the Application.®°

Publication and the ensuing trial by media would cause irreparable harm to
Respondent's due process rights.*' Because the Excerpts “reproduce the most
aggressive part of the Memorial’® and ASTV's earlier press releases have already
“unleashed waves of media reaction,”® publication of the Excerpts will obviously
generate further media coverage, leading to two potential and equally harmful
outcomes: either Respondent will remain silent and thereby run the risk of “severe
reputational damage, accusations of incompetence and non-transparency, and further
waves of media speculations and criticisms”;®* or Respondent will be forced to respond
to the Extracts and thereby invite the media and public to “comment, judge and criticize
the Government's substantive and procedural positions and strategies.”®>

While the urgency arising out of the intended publication of the Excerpts is not
disputed, Respondent notes that Claimants do contest the urgency of any decision
concerning potential publication of other Arbitration Documents given that they do not
currently intend to publish anything other than the Excerpts.® In reply, Estonia submits
that urgency arises when the matter to be decided cannot wait until a decision on the
merits of the dispute, which is clearly the case here.®”

 

B. Claimants’ Position

(i) There is no media campaign

Claimants submit that Respondent mischaracterizes both what Claimants have done
and what they are proposing to do in this instance. Claimants have not waged, are not
waging and have no intention of waging an “aggressive media campaign.”®° In any
event, it is important to underline that Estonia minimises or ignores altogether “its own
engagement with the media.”®?

Claimants propose nothing more than to post online an extract from their Memorial
comprised of Section Il (Summary of Claim) and VII (Estonia's Breaches of the BIT) of
the Memorial.°° The purpose is to “inform their current and potential shareholders, their
customers and other parties with an interest in the issues at stake in the arbitration of

the status of the arbitration and the Claimants’ position therein.”*' They have not
proposed and do not propose to publish any other document from the arbitration, and
they recall that as long ago as 19 January 2016% they undertook to “seek advance
agreement [from Estonia] regarding any publication, and if such agreement cannot be
reached the Claimants will provide Estonia with appropriate notice before any
publication such that Estonia can raise the matter with the Tribunal should it wish to do
so." In their Rejoinder, Claimants declare that they are willing “to go further and
agree that they will not publish any of Estonia's submissions, witness statements or
expert reports in connection with this arbitration.”

Claimants insist that the Extract does not disclose any information confidential to
Respondent or to any third party, or that it concerns state secrets or sensitive
information, or even that it contains information obtained from Respondent in the
arbitration. Indeed, according to Claimants, the Extract “relies on what are mostly
public facts to describe the narrative of this dispute at a high level” and explains “how
this narrative gives rise to the breach of Estonia's obligations under international
law.”®° Far from seeking to publish Arbitration Documents as defined by Respondent”
or to unleash a “media battle"®*, Claimants have taken a reasonable approach. °°
Although they are fully entitled to publish their Memorial, Claimants have refrained
from doing so and instead have voluntarily engaged with Respondent on this matter.'°°

Claimants argue that Respondent misrepresents what is in fact Claimants’ “minimal
media engagement.'®' They further argue that the evidence of their so-called “media
campaign”'®? is confined to a total of “seven news articles over the course of 20
months.” According to Claimants, the majority of these articles merely report on
stock exchange announcements made by ASTV regarding the existence and status of
the arbitration and the court proceedings in Estonia.’ In this regard, ASTV’s stock

exchange announcement of 24 July 2014 is accurate and supported by evidence; it
does not misrepresent the opinions of the experts in the Estonian court proceedings,
as alleged by Respondent. Similarly, Respondent's argument that Claimants leaked
ASTV's 14 October 2014 stock exchange announcement to the press in advance of its
Official release is baseless. Claimants aver that all stock exchange announcements are
kept confidential until they are released in accordance with the Tallinn Stock Exchange
tules;'°° the apparent simultaneity of publication to which Respondent refers has to do
with the software used by journalists, which indicates “the time at which the file is
opened for the author to begin work, not the time of publication of the article online.”'°7
The contents of the other articles were either not disclosed by Claimants'®® or provide
no basis for the proposition that Claimants are waging a media campaign.'°9

42. Although Respondent claims that these seven articles are merely “the tip of the
iceberg,”''° Respondent's evidence of other media engagement is confined to five
exhibits submitted with its Reply. Four of these predate this arbitration and comprise,
again, simple stock exchange announcements" that disclose “key factual milestones
relating to the proceedings.”''? The only actual press article submitted by Respondent,
dated 6 May 2011, clearly indicates that it is conveying ASTV’s perspective, and
moreover “presents a reasonable criticism of a regulatory decision by reference to the
relevant legal framework.”"13

43. In sum, Respondent's claim that ASTV’s stock exchange announcements have
“unleashed waves of media reaction” is clearly hyperbolic''* and unsupported by the
evidence."'5

(ii) The Application fails to meet the requirements of Article 47 of the
ICSID Convention

44. According to Claimants, five — not four — requirements have to be met in order for
tribunals to grant provisional measures:

c. necessity;
d. urgency; and

e. proportionality.""®

45. Claimants contend that applicants have to meet a high threshold in order for
provisional measures to be granted.''”? Respondent has failed to meet this threshold.""®

46. Claimants emphasize that Respondent omits to mention the requirement of
proportionality, which is applied by investment tribunals either as a stand-alone
requirement or as part of the requirement of necessity, as in Quiborax et al. v.
Bolivia.""° In addition to failing to satisfy the proportionality requirement, say Claimants,
Respondent has failed to establish both the existence of a right to be protected and the
necessity of the provisional measures requested.'2°

47. Asageneral matter, Claimants emphasize that there exists no duty of confidentiality in
ICSID arbitration, as recognized in World Duty Free and Biwater.'2' While parties are
free to agree on restrictions to the publication of their pleadings, there is no such
agreement in this case and a tribunal may only impose such restrictions if the
requirements for the grant of provisional measures are met.'? Claimants also rely on a
2004 Discussion Paper from the ICSID Secretariat to argue that there is no
requirement of “mutual consent [...] from the parties for the publication of the award
(much less a party's own submissions), nor [is there] anything improper or
impermissible about a party publishing it unilaterally.”125

did not rule on whether this case should be made public, it merely “complied with the

requirement for party consent to ICSID publication.”'@4 In Claimants’ view, “Estonia
cannot rely on its refusal to consent to ICSID publication [...] to alter the general
default position that its consent is not required for publication by the Claimants.”!25
Claimants submit that Respondent has failed to put forward a sufficiently strong case
for the Tribunal to depart from this default position.'2°

49. By contrast, the Tribunal should take into account the “overarching interest in the
transparency of the arbitration proceedings.” '?” Interested parties are entitled to
scrutinize the conduct of Estonia, which Claimants argue is in breach of international
law, as well as Claimants’ position in relation thereto.'?® According to Claimants, the
City of Tallinn supports such transparency, '?° and Respondent ought to do the
same.'8°

50. Claimants further contend that the cases Respondent relies upon in support of its
Application, namely Biwater, Lao Holdings, and Abaciat, must be distinguished from
the present case.'3!

51. As to Biwater, Claimants point out that in that case the respondent state was proposing
to publish “selected extracts of the other party's submissions [...], including information
confidential to that other party and a large number of documents obtained from the
other party through the document production process,”'*? with a risk of misrepresenting
the claimant's submissions. 1%?

52. In Claimants’ view, their proposed disclosure here is different because it is:
a. by the Claimants (who are the party complaining of a breach of their rights
under international law);

b. of only an extract of their own submissions, without the same risk of such
submissions being selectively published and thereby misrepresented; and

c. in circumstances where the underlying complaint in the arbitration concerns
negative commentary in the media by the state, i.e. the party resisting the
disclosure rather than by the party proposing the disclosure."

In addition, while the Biwater tribunal did impose some restrictions on the parties, it
also “permitted the parties to engage in general discussion about the case in public,
provided that such discussion was restricted to what was necessary and was not used
to antagonise or pressure another party, or make the resolution of the arbitration more
difficult.""95

According to Claimants, Respondent's reliance on Lao Holdings is equally misplaced
because the tribunal “was not considering any issues related to the publication of
submissions or other documents or the disclosure or discussion of any information
related to the arbitration.”16

As to Abaciat, Claimants argue that the tribunal's primary concern was not adverse
publicity but rather “the management of confidential information and [...] the potential
disclosure of documents obtained from the other parties as part of the document
production process.”'%” In addition, Claimants submit that the Abaclat decision, like
Biwater, supports their position because the Abaciat tribunal:

a. emphasised that pleadings are "likely to contain references to and details of
documents produced pursuant to a disclosure exercise". This is not the case with
the Extract;

b. held that in the absence of specific contractual or confidentiality obligations, the
parties were free to decide if and how to publish their own documents, provided
that the publication would not be used as an instrument to further antagonise the
Parties, exacerbate their differences, unduly pressure one of them, or render the
resolution of the dispute potentially more difficult; and

c. declined to prevent the parties from general discussion of the case, provided
that it was not intended to antagonise or pressure another party, or make the
resolution of the arbitration more difficult. [...]'°®

Furthermore, in Claimants’ view, the Biwater and Abaclat cases lend no support to
Respondent's argument that publication of party submissions automatically leads to an
aggravation of the dispute such as to warrant the imposition of provisional
measures.'°? Claimants point to the many cases in which party submissions have been
published without there being any need for tribunal intervention, thus confirming that
there is no causal link between publication and aggravation of the dispute.'#° The

burden is on Respondent to prove that the aggravation of the dispute will be the likely
consequence if the relief sought is not granted.'4"

57. Claimants further submit that in addition to misrepresenting the content and scope of
the aforementioned decisions, Respondent ignores decisions in which tribunals have
denied applications to prevent publication or disclosure. '4? Claimants refer in this
regard to Amco Asia v. Indonesia’ and emphasize that although the Amco tribunal
recognized that “a large press campaign”'“4 might have an influence on the State’s
economy, it would not be an influence on the rights actually in dispute in the arbitration,
which Claimants characterize as the “relevant reference point in granting provisional
measures.”'45 Referring to Churchill Mining v. Indonesia, Claimants emphasize that the
tribunal ruled that there is “no general rule imposing a duty of confidentiality on the
parties and prohibiting them from disclosing their case in public, as was already stated
30 years ago in Amco v. Indonesia.”'* The Churchill triounal recognized that “[a]t the
same time, it is true that the parties are bound by a good faith duty not to exacerbate
the dispute or affect the integrity of the arbitration proceedings,”'4” but found that “none
of the public statements made by the Claimant reach a level that could jeopardize the
Respondent's rights in dispute.”'48 Claimants also point to World Duty Free in which
the tribunal rejected the State’s request for a ban on public discussion of the case by
the parties."49

 

58. According to Claimants, these three cases show that “where tribunals have considered
circumstances similar to those at hand, those tribunals have determined that those
circumstances did not amount to aggravation of those disputes.” '° In addition,
contrary to Respondent, Claimants see no basis to distinguish between cases where
parties discuss publicly their positions in the arbitration and those where they publish

their own submissions. Both situations generate the risk that a party may be called
upon to comment in the media.'5"

59. Claimants go on to argue that three “key questions” have to be answered in the
positive for Estonia’s Application to be granted:

a. Does Estonia have a right susceptible of protection?
b. Has Estonia satisfied the necessity test?

c. Has Estonia satisfied the proportionality test?'5*

(a) No right susceptible of protection

60. Claimants argue that none of the cases relied upon by Respondent support the view
that “provisional measures can be granted in connection with any procedural
circumstance of the case, including peripheral issues like public discussion of the case
by the parties, which can have no impact on the underlying dispute,”'*? as Respondent
wrongly suggests. While Respondent invokes the protection of the "right of due
process," the "right not to have the dispute aggravated," and the "right to protect the
integrity of [the arbitration] proceedings,” '®* references in these cases to non-
aggravation of the dispute and preservation of the status quo concern rather “the
underlying harm at the core of the dispute between the parties and the prevention of
measures which make this underlying harm worse.”'5> Such rights are considered
“self-standing”'®* not because they are unconnected with the substantive dispute, but
because a party need not identify a contractual clause or other legal source of a right,
for example, not to have the dispute aggravated in order to be able to rely on such a
right in the context of an arbitration.'*” In Claimant’s words, “preserving the status quo
and not aggravating the dispute would mean preventing an increase in the harm to the
claimant [...] not freez[ing] the entire conditions of the arbitration in place [...].”15°

publication “does not affect the harm at the core of the claim and does not impact on
Estonia's ability to defend that claim, or the Tribunal's ability to rule on it.”159

61. In addition, as indicated earlier, the Biwater and Abaclat cases do not support
Respondent's unqualified view that "reporting and publication exacerbates the dispute,
creates external pressure on the parties, witnesses, experts, and other participants in
the process, and often imposes a ‘trial by the media’."1©°

62. Lastly, Respondent fails to demonstrate how the proposed publication of the Extract
would in fact aggravate the parties’ dispute.'*' In Claimants’ view, Respondent does
not explain how its alleged rights would be harmed, how the creation of a so-called
parallel forum for the resolution of the dispute — i.e., the media — would affect the

(c) No proportionality

66. _ In addition to failing the necessity test, Respondent also fails and in fact does not even
address the issue of proportionality, which requires “balancing the inconvenience in the
imposition of the measures upon the parties.”!75

67. In order to give proper consideration to this “balance of inconvenience”, the Tribunal
must take into account the “countervailing interest in favour of transparency” as well as
the potentially substantial damage that Claimants would suffer should the Application
be granted. 17° Claimants contend that Respondent itself has waged a “negative
publicity campaign”'”’ regarding ASTV’s excessive profitability and tariffs, which is
precisely one of the BIT violations that Claimants invoke in this arbitration. Claimants
refer to comments made by the head of the Estonian Competition Authority ("ECA"),
the Minister for Economic Affairs and Communications, members of the Estonian
Parliament and the Legal Chancellor,'”° as well as the government-funded EOKL.'7°
Respondent's attempt to deny any involvement in the conduct of EOKL on the basis of
the ILC Articles on State Responsibility misses the point.'®° Claimants believe that
EOKL was “influenced” by Respondent, including through members of the Estonian
Parliament who were on the management board of EOKL at the time of its negative
media comments about ASTV.181

68. If, as Respondent claims, criticism of ASTV in the Estonian media is generated by
“private individuals and entities” and as such “is not an act attributable to Estonia,”
then, Claimants submit, the relief sought by Respondent would not be proportionate
because it “would not prevent the continuation of this campaign against ASTV but

would prevent the Claimants responding to it.”"®* Claimants insist that the negative
media coverage emanating from the Estonian state apparatus continues.'®>

69. In addition, although Claimants do not believe that Respondent actually had no
involvement in the allegedly illegal leak of an internal government document or in the
statements of the EOKL, they contend that “Estonia's admitted lack of control over
information within the state apparatus provides the Claimants and the Tribunal with
little confidence that such disclosures will not happen again.”'®+

70. Respondent's argument that Claimants would suffer no harm if the Application were
granted has no merit. 185 Claimants insist that the issue not only concerns their
obligation to provide certain information to their stakeholders and the public, it also
concerns how Claimants choose to “run their business and communicate with their
current and potential shareholders and customers.”'® This dispute is highly relevant to
Claimants’ operations since it “goes to the heart [...] of the value of their single most
valuable investment.”'®” Being prevented from communicating publicly on the present
dispute has potential to cause substantial harm to Claimants.'®°

71. Claimants conclude that the relief sought in the Application goes well beyond
restrictions on the publication of the Extract, and would “limit any discussion of the
Claimants’ claims whatsoever.” '®° The measures sought by Respondent are
disproportionate,'®° and the Application should therefore be dismissed.

anonymized information that would allow their identification).

In accordance with Article 23.1 of the Procedural Order No. 1, Estonia confirms its
agreement to the publication of the order on Estonia’s Application issued by the
Tribunal."*"

73. Claimants request:

On the basis of the foregoing, without limitation and fully reserving its right to
supplement the relief sought in these proceedings, the Claimants request that the
Tribunal dismiss Estonia's Application in its entirety.

The Claimants reserve the right to ask the Tribunal to take into account the
bringing and conduct of this Application when considering costs at the end of the
arbitration.

In the event that the Tribunal is minded to grant the relief sought in Estonia's
Application, the Claimants request that:

a. The Tribunal's recommendation be phrased so as not to place any burden on
the Claimants with regard to the conduct of independent third parties, but rather to
require the Claimants themselves to "take no steps" to publish any Arbitration
Document;

b. The Tribunal's recommendation be limited to, at most, the relief sought in
paragraph 71 (a) of Estonia's Application; and

c. In accordance with Article 23.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal's
recommendation be published by ICSID and the Claimants be permitted to share
this recommendation directly with their shareholders. The Claimants note that
Estonia agreed to this in its Reply at paragraph 114.1%

11 Reply, 4 113-114. See also Application, 1 71-72. In footnote 76 to paragraph 113 of the Reply,
Respondent made the following observation:

Claimants state that Estonia’s Application should have requested the Tribunal to issue a
recommendation rather than an order. (See Claimants’ Response, {| 120) While Estonia considers this
issue to be immaterial, this Tribunal is in fact empowered to issue orders under Article 47 of the ICSID
Convention. This was confirmed for example in Occidental v. Ecuador [...]. See Occidental v. Ecuador,
ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Provisional Measures, 17 August 2007, 58, RL-171.

192 Rejoinder, {| 97-99 (emphasis in the original). At paragraph 120 of its Response, Claimants note
that “Estonia has sought an ‘order’ from the Tribunal in its Application. For good order, the Claimants
note that the Tribunal is empowered by the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules to make
a ‘recommendation’, rather than an order.”

ANALYSIS

A. Legal Framework
(i) The ICSID Convention and Rules

The rules regarding provisional measures are set out at Article 47 of the ICSID
Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Rules. These grant broad discretion to a tribunal
to craft such provisional measures as it considers appropriate in the circumstances to
preserve the rights of the parties.

Article 47 of the ICSID Convention reads:

Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the
circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be
taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.

Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:

(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that
provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the
Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the
recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such
measures.

(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made
pursuant to paragraph (1).

(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative
or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any
time modify or revoke its recommendations.

(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or
revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting
its observations.

(5) If a party makes a request pursuant to paragraph (1) before the constitution
of the Tribunal, the Secretary-General shall, on the application of either party, fix
time limits for the parties to present observations on the request, so that the
request and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its
constitution.

(6) Nothing in this Rule shall prevent the parties, provided that they have so
stipulated in the agreement recording their consent, from requesting any judicial or
other authority to order provisional measures, prior to or after the institution of the
proceeding, for the preservation of their respective rights and interests.

Rule 19 of the ICSID Rules is also worth recalling, as regards the Tribunal’s authority
generally to make such orders as it considers required for the conduct of the
arbitrations:

The Tribunal shall make the orders required for the conduct of the proceeding.

81.

(ii) Requirements for provisional measures

From these rules a number of practical requirements, or criteria, have developed which
assist in determining whether and in what particular circumstances provisional
measures are called for, as well as the nature of such measures as may be warranted.
There is no real dispute between the parties regarding the nature of these criteria, as is
clear from their pleadings. Although formulated in different ways by different tribunals —
and by the parties themselves here — five criteria apply:

i. prima facie jurisdiction of the tribunal;

prima facie existence of a right susceptible of protection / prima facie case on
the merits;

ii. necessity of the measure requested;
iv. urgency of the measure requested;

v. proportionality of the measure requested (balance of inconvenience). '%?

B. Discussion

The parties’ fulsome submissions cover comprehensively and very effectively the legal
and factual questions that arise from Estonia’s Application and that must be addressed
in order to determine whether the Application is to be granted or denied.

(i) | The “starting point”

The starting point of the particular analysis called for in the circumstances here, where
Respondent seeks measures designed to limit and control the publication or other
disclosure of documents and information related to the arbitration, is the question
whether parties to ICSID arbitration are under a general duty of confidentiality and/or
whether they have a general right of disclosure.

The Tribunal does not consider that there is a general prohibition in ICSID arbitration
against a party publishing extracts of its own submissions. Nor, on the other hand, is
there a general rule permitting unfettered publication. In this respect, the Tribunal
shares the opinion expressed by the tribunal in Biwater, one of the principal cases that
address this question and on which all parties in this arbitration rely:

In the absence of any agreement between the parties on this issue, there is no
provision imposing a general duty of confidentiality in ICSID arbitration, whether in
the ICSID Convention, any of the applicable Rules or otherwise. Equally. however.

 

188 Application, 39; Response, J 10; Reply, {101 et seq.; Rejoinder, {{ 82 et seq.

Page 26

United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. et a/. v. Republic of Estonia Decision on Provisional Measures
(ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24)

there is no provision imposing a general rule of or non-confidentialit
in any of these sources.'%*

[Emphasis added]

82. This statement of general principle — no general duty of confidentiality/no general right
to disclose — is consistent with the analysis found in other decisions and commentary
to which the parties refer. For example, as noted by the tribunal in Abaciat:

[...] if it is true that there is no general duty of confidentiality, this is not to be
understood as a “carte blanche” entitling a Party to disclose as it deems fit any
kind of information or documents issued or produced in this proceeding."

83. Along similar lines, and with reference specifically to the existence of an express rule
concerning the sort of publication/disclosure proposed by Claimants, Professor
Schreuer observes:

The Arbitration Rules do not say that the parties must keep their memorials
secret. In fact, a note to the 1968 Arbitration Rules specifically points out that the
parties are not prohibited from publishing their pleadings. It adds that they may.
however, come to an understanding to refrain from doing so, particularly if they
feel that publication may exacerbate the dispute. '*

[Emphasis added]

84. The tribunal in Abaclat, some years after Biwater, framed the general proposition
regarding confidentiality/disclosure (or transparency) this way:

In conclusion, the Tribunal deems that the ICSID Convention and Arbitration
Rules do not comprehensively cover the question of the
confidentiality/transparency of the proceedings. Thus, in accordance with Article
44 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 19 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, unless
there exist an agreement of the Parties on the issue of
confidentiality/transparency, the Tribunal shall decide on the matter on a case by
case basis and, instead of tending towards imposing a general rule in favour or
against confidentiality, try to achieve a solution that balances the general interest
for transparency with specific interests for confidentiality of certain information
and/or documents.'*”

85. The Tribunal considers that in addition to the no general duty/no general right principle
so aptly articulated in Biwater, the approach by the Abaciat tribunal to bridging the

91.

confidentiality/disclosure divide is both fully in line with applicable rules and eminently
sensible.

As to the next steps in the analysis, the Tribunal will indeed consider all the
circumstances of the case, in order to decide whether to grant the requested
provisional measures.

Before proceeding with the analysis, however, the Tribunal pauses to address two
matters tangential but nonetheless connected both to what has been said and to what
follows. First, the Tribunal cannot but note that no understanding exists between the
parties here as to their entitlement or not to publish their own submissions, and that
Claimants have nonetheless agreed — helpfully, in our view — to refrain from publishing
the Extract pending the Tribunal's consideration of the important and wide-ranging
issues raised in Respondent's Application. Second, for the sake of clarity, the Tribunal
states emphatically that in issuing Procedural Order No. 1 it did not address, let alone
confirm, and it does not consider that PO 1 either addresses or confirms, the position
of any party regarding the questions at issue here regarding the parties’ duties and
rights. Paragraph 23.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 does no more than record, as it says
it does, the parties’ consent for ICSID to publish the procedural orders, decisions and
awards issued in this case subject to the redaction of confidential information.

We turn now to a consideration of whether the Application satisfies the criteria for the
taking of provisional measures.

(ii) Prima facie jurisdiction

There is no dispute as to the Tribunal’s prima facie jurisdiction. As discussed
above, Claimants’ contestation of Estonia’s Application is based on other grounds.
The Tribunal indeed considers that its prima facie jurisdiction is based here on the
consent between Claimants and Estonia, the consent of Estonia having been given in
the BIT and the consent of the Claimants in their Request for Arbitration.

(iii) Prima facie existence of a right susceptible of protection

The rights that Estonia claims its Application is intended to protect are enumerated in
its pleadings summarised above. The Tribunal considers that these can be grouped
under the rubric of procedural integrity and non-aggravation of the dispute. 1
Claimants’ publication of the Extract, Respondent claims, would harm this right.

There is no dispute — and rightly so, in the Tribunal’s view — that both substantive and
procedural rights are “susceptible of protection” by means of provisional measures.
The crux of Claimants’ argument here is that procedural rights in this context do not
encompass “purely procedural matters which do not have any bearing on the
underlying dispute or the harm alleged to flow from that underlying dispute.”'%? In the
circumstances of this case, say Claimants, the right asserted by Respondent — the

96.

right to procedural integrity and non-aggravation of the dispute — and the protections
sought are wholly unrelated to the parties’ substantive claims in the arbitration and
could have no bearing on the merits of the case or the parties’ substantive rights.

The Tribunal does not share this view.

The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that, merely because certain other tribunals have
found that publication of arbitration documents or information could exacerbate the
dispute in those cases, it does not follow that “publication in every case [...] must self-
evidently amount to aggravation of the dispute.” As Claimants say, there is no basis
in the case law (and the Tribunal would add, or in principle) for such an unqualified
proposition. But that is not the foundation of the Tribunal’s decision, which rests rather
on the considered view, as explained below, that — in the circumstances of this
arbitration — Claimants’ proposed publication of the Extract is more likely than not to
disrupt these proceedings and aggravate this dispute between these several parties.

Claimants deny that they are involved in any media campaign or that Respondent has
in any event proven a link between such reporting as has appeared in the media and
any harm that it has suffered or may suffer as a result of any publicity. On the other
hand, Claimants themselves repeatedly insist that “Estonia has waged a negative
publicity campaign against ASTV and that this is one of the breaches of the BIT on
which Claimants found their claims in the arbitration.”2°' Moreover, Claimants argue
that “the damage to Claimants’ interests in the event that Estonia’s Application is
granted, preventing the Claimants from not only publishing a summary of their position
but also discussing the case publicly, has the potential to be substantial.”

It would seem that there is indeed, even in Claimants’ view, a very real connection
between publicity related to the arbitration and harm, not merely to what Claimants call
the “dispute proceedings” but to the parties’ interests and rights in the “underlying
substantive dispute.”

Claimants go further and state that “the reason” they oppose the requested provisional
measures and “wish to reserve their rights in relation to disclosure is to enable them to
be responsive where necessary” to “misleading and damaging” reports emanating from
Estonia.2% Later, they claim that they “consider it necessary to be able to respond to
further negative publicity” emanating from sources within the Estonian government or
government-funded entities.2°5

101.

In such circumstances, it hardly lies with Claimants to plead that publicity can have no
bearing on the parties’ underlying rights or is not “related to the specific issues in
dispute in the arbitration.”20°

(iv) Necessity

The question is whether the measures sought by Respondent — the restraints on
publicity that it proposes — are necessary for procedural integrity and non-aggravation
of the dispute in the circumstances of this case.

Claimants argue that Estonia fails to prove exactly how publication of the Extract will
aggravate the dispute or threaten its rights. However, the discussion above illustrates
the real and direct connection between the very sort of publicity that Claimants
envisage and the parties’ underlying dispute. Each side accuses the other of waging a
media war. Each side claims that it is harmed by the other’s publicity campaign.
Claimants themselves insist that they need to be able to continue to counter Estonia’s
conduct in this regard, whether intentional or otherwise, by publishing documents or
information from the arbitration; this is part of the justification for publishing the Extract.
Presumably they would accord the same right to Estonia “to respond to further
negative publicity” and “to be responsive where necessary [to] misleading and
damaging leaks appearing from [Claimants];” and they have stated that they would
have no objection to Respondent publishing excerpts from their pleadings similar to the
Extract.

Claimants correctly argue that “the necessity investigation focuses upon the nature
and extent of the harm which is likely to occur to the applicant in the event that the
provisional measure sought is not granted.”°? They are wrong, though, when they
claim that Respondent has failed to address the nature of the harm with which it says it
is threatened, or that it has failed to show that such harm is likely to occur. Both the
nature of the harm in question here and the likelihood of its occurrence (in the absence
of any control on publication or other form of disclosure by the parties) are addressed
above. The Tribunal is of the view that the sort of tit-for-tat publicity described here —
beginning or continuing (it matters not how this is described) with the Extract and going
forward from there — which the parties describe as being almost inevitable, and
inevitably damaging, need not be branded a “war” or a “campaign” in order for the
Tribunal to find, as it does, that such conduct would inevitably harm the parties’
respective rights in the dispute.

In any case, neither the nature nor the likelihood of the harm in question need be
demonstrated with certainty. It suffices, as Respondent notes — and this is expressly
acknowledged by Claimants — that such harm be likely;2°° specifically, that it be more
likely than not to occur if provisional measures are not taken. As stated in Biwater.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24)

In truth, [the applicant's] complaint amounts to a concern about the risk of future
prejudice, or the potential risk to the arbitral process as it unfolds hereafter.

The Tribunal disagrees, however, with the suggestion that actual harm must be
manifested before any measures may be taken. Its mandate and responsibility
includes ensuring that the proceedings will be conducted in the future in a regular,
fair and orderly manner (including by issuing and enforcing procedural directions
to that effect). Among other things, its mandate extends to ensuring that potential
inhibitions and unfairness do not arise; equally, its mandate extends to attempting
to reduce the risk of future aggravation and exacerbation of the dispute, which
necessarily involves probabilities, not certainties.2

102. The Tribunal considers the subsequent paragraph of Biwater equally applicable in the
circumstances here:

Given the media campaign that has already been fought on both sides of this case
(by many entities beyond the parties to this arbitration), and the general media
interest that already exists, the Tribunal is satisfied that there exists a sufficient
tisk of harm or prejudice, as well as aggravation in this case to warrant some form
of control.?'°

(v) Urgency

103. The Tribunal agrees with the formulation of the urgency requirement advocated by
Respondent: urgency is not restricted to “matters which will happen in the immediately
foreseeable future.”*'' Urgency is to be assessed according to the circumstances,
which include the requested measures; and the requirement may be satisfied on a
showing that the requested measures are necessary at a certain point in time before
the award is issued.

104. In this case, urgency is not disputed with respect to the publication of the Extract.
However, Claimants do argue that there is no urgency with respect to “broader
publication”, in which they do not at this time intend to engage:

The Claimants have no current intention of publishing any other documents or
submissions from the arbitration, and have already confirmed that they will in any
event not publish any of Estonia's [materials] without seeking advance agreement
from Estonia, and without providing Estonia with appropriate notice before any
publication such that Estonia can raise the matter with the Tribunal should it wish
to do so. Relief restraining the Claimants from doing something they have already
indicated they do not intend to do, and will in any event provide notice before
doing, cannot be necessary or urgent, and there is therefore no need for the

Tribunal to consider, much less address, any possible broader publication at this
stage.?"2

105. The Tribunal sees things differently. The Tribunal has already stated that it considers
that the parties’ rights would be at risk from additional publicity in this case; and that
additional publicity appears likely in the circumstances, as discussed above. Though it
may not be decisive, the Tribunal is also mindful of the obvious limitation — the gap — in
Claimants’ repeated statement of “no current intention.” As framed, and indeed for the
reason explained by Claimants, their statement of intent provides for the possibility that
Claimants might decide unilaterally to publish further of their own arbitration
documents without further warning.

106. The Tribunal considers that the urgency requirement is satisfied in the circumstances.
(vi) Proportionality

107. Claimants submit that preventing them from discussing their claim publicly is wholly
disproportionate to whatever harm may befall Estonia solely by publication of the
Extract. Stated in this fashion, it perhaps could be said that the balance of
inconvenience is such that the Tribunal should decline to grant the Application.
However, “preventing the Claimants from discussing their claim publicly”, including as
may be required to satisfy legal or regulatory (including stock exchange/securities)
disclosure duties, is not what is sought in the Application, and it is certainly not what
the Tribunal has in mind.

108. On the contrary, the Tribunal considers the measures discussed below to be not only
necessary, but in fact reasonable, fair and entirely proportionate in the light of the
concerns and interests expressed by both sides.

 

(vii) The bindi ofa ision on provisi iu

109. Finally, lest there be any doubt in respect of this question, the Tribunal considers that it
has the authority to order, not merely to “recommend”, provisional measures. This has
been recognised by many ICSID tribunals, as stated in Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine:

[A]ccording to a well-established principle laid down by the jurisprudence of ICSID
tribunals, provisional measures ‘recommended’ by an ICSID tribunal are legally
compulsory; they are in effect ‘ordered’ by the tribunal and the parties are under a
legal obligation to comply with them.?'?

nature by ICSID tribunals. The question of the legal scope of provisional measures has been the
subject of much debate, but seems to be solved today. The International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) was
the first to affirm the principle of their binding nature, when it declared the following in the LaGrand

(viii) Conclusion: appropriate form of provisional measures

110. The Tribunal has hesitated between, on the one hand, issuing a decision which would
require the parties to submit certain types of intended disclosures to each other for
approval and, if necessary, to the Tribunal for a ruling prior to publication — in effect,
what Claimants have done here — and, on the other hand, issuing a decision which, in
ruling on certain types of disclosure and setting out expected standards of conduct for
others, essentially relies on both the good faith and the good sense of the parties. It
opts for the latter.

111. It is noted that Respondent expressly acknowledges “both Parties’ right to engage in
general public discussion of the case,” and it recognizes “that it may be necessary for
both Parties to generally comment on the progress of the case [...]."2’4 To this extent
the Tribunal agrees with Respondent. The Tribunal does not agree, however, with the
limits on such discussion proposed by Respondent, which as Estonia states, seek in
effect to ban the parties from any discussion of “the substance of the case” (other than
general statements to the effect that “Claimants claim violations of the Treaty” and
“Estonia denies Claimants’ claims in full.”)°"S The Tribunal considers that such a ban is
not called for: it is neither necessary nor proportionate to the potential harm that has
been described.

112. The Tribunal shares in this respect many of the views and adopts many aspects of the
general approach taken by the Abaclat and Biwater tribunals.*'° Specifically, the
Tribunal considers that no party should be prevented from engaging in general
discussion about the case in public, which discussion is not limited to updates on the
status of the case, and may include wider aspects of the case such as a summary of
the parties’ positions, provided that such public discussion is not used as an instrument
to antagonise any party, exacerbate the parties’ differences, aggravate the dispute,
disrupt the proceedings or unduly pressure any party.

113. For the sake of clarity, in view of the particular circumstances here and the particular
measures requested by Respondent, such public discussion does not include

 

judgment: ‘The power to indicate provisional measures entails that such measures should be binding.’
Article 47 of the ICSID Convention was modeled on Article 41(1) of the Statute of the ICJ. The only
difference is that the verb “recommend” is used in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention while “indicate” is
used in the corresponding Article of the ICJ’s Statute. With a few exceptions, ICSID tribunals widely
embrace the view that provisional measures have a binding nature. As far as the materialization of this
binding nature is concerned, ICSID tribunals concur on their authority to draw negative inferences
should a party fail to comply with the ordered provisional measures.” (footnotes omitted)

publication of the “Arbitration Documents” as defined by Respondent,?"” or any excerpt
or extract thereof.

IV. DECISION and ORDER
114. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS, the Tribunal decides as follows:
(1) Respondent's Application for Provisional Measures is granted in part.

(2) No party is prevented from engaging in general discussion about the case in
public, which discussion is not limited to updates on the status of the case,
and may include wider aspects of the case such as a summary of the parties’
positions, provided that such public discussion is not used as an instrument to
antagonise any party, exacerbate the parties’ differences, aggravate the
dispute, disrupt the proceedings or unduly pressure any party.

S

Such public discussion does not include publication of the “Arbitration
Documents,” i.e., the documents filed in this arbitration, such as the parties’
written submissions, witness statements, expert reports and documents
produced within the framework of document production, or any excerpt or
extract thereof.

(4) Any request not granted herein is denied.

217 “Arbitration Documents” are defined as “documents filed in this arbitration, such as the Parties’
written submissions, witness statements, expert reports and documents produced within the
framework of document production.” See: Application, J] 4.
