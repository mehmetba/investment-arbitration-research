COMPLAINT

Plaintiffs InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited, European Investments
(Morén) 1 Limited, European Investments (Morén) 2 Limited, European Investments (Olivenza)
1 Limited, and European Investments (Olivenza) 2 Limited (collectively, “Plaintiffs”), by and
through their undersigned counsel, hereby bring this action seeking an order pursuant to 22
U.S.C. § 1650a registering as a foreign judgment an arbitral award (“the ICSID Award”) issued
on August 2, 2019 pursuant to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States, Mar. 18, 1965, 17 U.S.T. 1270 (the “ICSID Convention”)
in favor of Plaintiffs and against the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain”). See Declaration of Alexander
A. Yanos (“Yanos Decl.”) filed concurrently herewith, Ex. 1. Pursuant to 22 U.C.S. § 1650a, the
pecuniary obligations imposed by an award issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention “shall be
enforced and shall be given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of
a court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States.” The ICSID Award should therefore
be registered and enforced as a foreign judgment and afforded full faith and credit in this district.

The Parties

1. Plaintiff InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited (“InfraRed”) is a
private limited company organized and existing under the laws of the United Kingdom.
InfraRed acts in its own name and on its own behalf and as a General Partner in the name and on
behalf of InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure Fund I LP, InfraRed Environmental
Infrastructure Fund II LP, and InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure Fund III LP.

2. Plaintiff European Investments (Morén) | Limited is a private limited company
organized and existing under the laws of the United Kingdom.

3. Plaintiff European Investments (Morén) 2 Limited is a private limited company

organized and existing under the laws of the United Kingdom.

2

4. Plaintiff European Investments (Olivenza) 1 Limited is a private limited company
organized and existing under the laws of the United Kingdom.

5. Plaintiff European Investments (Olivenza) 2 Limited is a private limited company
organized and existing under the laws of the United Kingdom.

6. Defendant Spain is a foreign state within the meaning of the Foreign Sovereign
Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1441(d), 1602-1611.

Jurisdiction and Venue

7. This Court has original subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a
as well as under 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) because this is a case in which the Plaintiffs seek to confirm
against a foreign state an arbitration award “governed by a treaty or other international
agreement in force in the United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral
awards,” specifically the ICSID Convention.

8. The Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Spain pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§
1330(b) and 1605(a). Spain waived its immunity from the jurisdiction of this Court under 28
U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1) by becoming a party to the ICSID Convention. This action also falls within
the FSIA’s exception to sovereign immunity provided for at 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6)(B) because
Plaintiffs seek confirmation of an arbitration award governed by the ICSID Convention, a treaty
in force in the United States calling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.!

9. Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4).

Convention”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 201-208, a conclusion directly applicable under the ICSID Convention).

The ICSID Convention and the Treaty

10. The ICSID Convention, see Yanos Decl., Ex. 2, establishes a framework for the
arbitration of investor-state disputes arising between “Contracting States” and nationals of other
Contracting States. The Convention also establishes the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) as a part of the World Bank to administer investor-state
arbitrations governed by the ICSID Convention, such as the arbitration leading to Plaintiffs’
ICSID Award.

11. Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention gives ICSID jurisdiction over “any legal
dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State . . . and a national of
another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the
Centre.” Article 25(1) further provides that “[w]hen the parties have given their consent, no
party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.” Id.

12. The ICSID Convention also obliges each of the ICSID Convention’s 163
Contracting States to recognize and enforce ICSID awards.” Article 54(1) of the Convention
provides that:

Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant
to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary
obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were
a final judgment of a court in that state. A Contracting State with a
federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its
federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the

award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent
state.

Member-States.aspx (last visited March 17, 2020).

 

13. The United States has been a Contracting State to the ICSID Convention since
1966. The United States’ obligations under Article 54(1) of the Convention are implemented in
US. law at 28 U.S.C. § 1650a(a), which in relevant part provides:

An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of
the Convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the
United States. The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an
award shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and
credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general
jurisdiction of one of the several States. (emphasis added)

14. Unlike other international arbitration awards, awards rendered under the ICSID
Convention are not subject to review under the Federal Arbitration Act and do not require
confirmation in the manner prescribed by the Federal Arbitration Act. This is explicit from 28
U.S.C. § 1650a, which provides that “[t]he Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) shall not
apply to enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the Convention.” See OI European Grp.
B.V. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, No. 16-1533, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85128, *11
(D.D.C. 2019) (“ICSID’s enabling statute makes clear that the Court may not re-examine the
propriety of the award”); TECO Guatemala Holdings, LLC v. Republic of Guatemala, No. CV-
17-102, 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 168518, *12 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2018) (“a member state is ‘not
permitted to examine an ICSID award’s merits, its compliance with international law, or the
ICSID tribunal’s jurisdiction to render the award’; all it may do is ‘examine the judgment’s
authenticity and enforce the obligation imposed by the award.”); Teco Guatemala Holdings, LLC
v. Republic of Guatemala, No. 17-102, 2019 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 169168, at *17 (D.D.C. Oct. 1,
2019) (noting that Congress “plac[ed] ICSID awards beyond the scope of the FAA”). See also
Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, 863 F.3d 96, 102 (2d Cir. 2017)

(“Member states’ courts are . . . not permitted to examine an ICSID award’s merits, its

compliance with international law, or the ICSID tribunal’s jurisdiction to render the award; under

the Convention’s terms, they may do no more than examine the judgment’s authenticity and
enforce the obligations imposed by the award.”).

15. Instead, and by design, review of ICSID awards is encapsulated within the
framework of the ICSID Convention itself. ICSID Awards may be annulled or set aside only by
specially constituted ad hoc committees appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative
Council of ICSID (ex officio the President of the World Bank) on specific grounds enumerated in
the ICSID Convention. See Yanos Decl., Ex. 2 (Arts. 52-53).

16. Both Spain and the United Kingdom are Contracting States to the ICSID
Convention. The ICSID Convention entered into force for Spain on September 17, 1994 and for
the United Kingdom on January 18, 1967.*

17. The Energy Charter Treaty (“Treaty”), 2080 U.N.T.S. 100 (1994), is a multilateral
treaty that was signed in December 1994 and that entered into force in April 1998. The purpose
of the Treaty is to “promote long-term cooperation in the energy field, based on
complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the
European Energy Charter.” Yanos Decl., Ex. 1,4 10. Spain and the United Kingdom are both
parties to the Treaty.*

18. Pursuant to Article 26(4) of the Treaty, the United Kingdom and Spain, among
others, consented to arbitrate disputes with one another’s investors arising under the Treaty

before ICSID.

The Arbitration and the ICSID Award

19. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Spain pursued a policy intended to attract
foreign investment in renewable technologies, including concentrated solar power (“CSP”)
plants. Yanos Decl., Ex. 1,3. As of 1999, Spain had put in place a regulatory regime that
assured renewable energy producers of the remuneration necessary to make renewable energy
production profitable, and that made Spain into a uniquely attractive destination for investments
in renewable energy technology. /d., 15.

20. In 2011, and in reliance on Spain’s regulatory framework for renewable energy,
Plaintiffs invested a total of US$ 31 million in two Spanish CSP plants. Id., 7.

21. Spain subsequently enacted a series of changes to its regulatory regime for
renewable energy production. These changes reduced the remuneration available to renewable
energy producers, including CSP plants, and adversely impacted the economics of Plaintiffs’
investments in a manner contrary to the expectations on which Plaintiffs relied in making their
investment and in breach of Spain’s duty to afford Plaintiffs’ investment Fair and Equitable
Treatment pursuant to Article 10 of the Treaty. Plaintiffs filed a Request for Arbitration against
Spain on May 8, 2014, thus accepting Spain’s standing offer to arbitrate investor-state disputes
arising under the Treaty. See id. 196.

22. In that Request, Plaintiffs sought compensation on the basis that Spain’s
legislative and regulatory changes violated Spain’s obligations under the Treaty. Jd. 9. The
ICSID Secretariat registered Plaintiffs’ Request as InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP
Limited and others v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/14/12) on June 3, 2014. Yanos

Decl., Ex. 1 at 1.97.

23. Consistent with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules, a three-
member Tribunal was constituted for the case. The Tribunal was composed of three eminent
international lawyers: Professor William W. Park, a national of the United States of America and
Switzerland, appointed by Plaintiffs; Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of France,
appointed by Spain; and Mr. Stephen L. Drymer, a national of Canada, as a presiding arbitrator,
based on the ICSID Secretary-General’s proposal pursuant to the parties’ request to ICSID. Jd.,
{I 98-102.

24. Following the exchange of voluminous written submissions, the Tribunal held a
four-day oral hearing in Paris, France, from April 24 to April 28, 2017. See id. at 5.

25. Subsequently, on August 2, 2019, the Tribunal issued the ICSID Award pursuant
to Chapter IV (Articles 48-49) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal ordered Spain to pay
Plaintiffs compensation as follows:

(i) € 28,200,200 as the principal amount of compensation to Plaintiffs;

(ii) pre-award interest from June 30, 2014 through August 2, 2019, calculated at a rate

equal to 2% compounded annually;

(iii) post-award interest on the principal amount of compensation calculated at a rate

equal to 2% compounded annually until the date of payment;

(iv) — The costs of the arbitration, in the amount of US$ 642,757.70;

(v) an amount equivalent to 66.66 % of the Plaintiffs’ legal costs; and

(vi) _ post-award interest on costs calculated at a rate equal to 2% compounded annually

until the date of payment.
See Yanos Decl., Ex. 1 [{ 599-618. A detailed calculation of amounts payable under the ICSID

Award as of March 13, 2020 is attached as Exhibit 2 to the Yanos Declaration.

26. The ICSID Award is binding on Spain. Pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention,
Spain is obligated to “abide by and comply with the terms of the award” unless and “except to
the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed” by an ad hoc committee constituted under
Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.
27. The ICSID Award was stayed by an ICSID ad hoc committee constituted on February 21,
2020 at Spain’s request.> As such, Spain may defer payment of the pecuniary obligations
imposed by the ICSID Award and Plaintiffs correspondingly may not collect on the ICSID
Award against Spanish assets until the stay is lifted. The ICSID Award nevertheless retains the
status of a final judgment of a court of one of the several states entitled to full faith and credit in
this Court. See 22 U.S.C. § 1650a.

CAUSE OF ACTION (22 U.S.C. § 1650a

28. Plaintiffs restate and reincorporate all of the foregoing paragraphs of this Petition
as though fully set forth herein.

29. The United States is a Contract State to the ICSID Convention. Article 54(1) of
the ICSID Convention requires Contracting States to “recognize an award rendered pursuant to
[the ICSID] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award
within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.”

30. Article 54(1) is incorporated into U.S. law by 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, which requires
that the pecuniary obligations imposed by the Plaintiffs’ ICSID Award “shall be given the same

full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one

5 See InfraRed Environmental Infrastructure GP Limited and others v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No.
ARB/14/12), Procedural Details, available at https://icsid. worldbank.org/en/Pages/cases/
casedetail.aspx?CaseNo=ARB/14/12.

of the several States.” In turn, 28 U.S.C. § 1738 requires this Court to accord full faith and credit
to the authenticated judgments of the several states.

31. An authenticated copy of the ICSID Award, bearing the certification of the
Secretary General of ICSID is attached as to the supporting declaration of Alexander Yanos as
Exhibit 1.

32. For all these reasons, pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, Article 54 of the ICSID
Convention, and 28 U.S.C. § 1738 the ICSID Award must be recognized and the pecuniary
obligations thereof enforced “as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general
jurisdiction of one of the several states.”

PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter an order and judgment: (i)
recognizing the ICSID Award and enforcing the pecuniary obligations imposed by the ICSID
Award as if the ICSID Award were a final judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one of
the several States; (ii) staying execution of such judgment until the stay imposed by the ad hoc

committee has been lifted; and (iii) granting such other relief as may be just and proper.
