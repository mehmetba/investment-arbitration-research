Plaintiff the Sultanate of Oman (“Oman”), by and through its undersigned attorneys,
brings this action against Defendant Adel A Hamadi Al Tamimi (“Al Tamim’) pursuant to 22
U.S.C. § 1650a and Article 54 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, Mar. 18, 1965, 17 U.S.T. 1270, 575 U.N.T.S. 159
(“ICSID Convention”). The action seeks to enforce a monetary award issued in favor of Oman
and against Al Tamimi in arbitration proceedings conducted under the auspices of the
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”).

INTRODUCTION

arbitration proceedings captioned ARB/11/33 (“Award”). A copy of the Award is attached as

Tamimi to pay costs in the amount of $5,677,410.24, plus interest on that sum at the 91-day US
Treasury Bill rate, compounded quarterly. Al Tamimi has not paid any part of the amount due

Oman under the Award.

3. Defendant Al Tamimi is a natural person and United States citizen who resides in
Wakefield, Massachusetts.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b),
which provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over actions and proceedings under subsection (a) of this section, regardless of the amount in
controversy.” Section 1650a(a) provides that “[t]he pecuniary obligations imposed by [an ICSID
award] . . . shall be given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a
court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States.”

5. Venue is proper in the District of Massachusetts pursuant to 28 U.S.C.

§ 1391(b)(1), which provides that an action may be brought in a district “in which any defendant
resides.”
FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. The ICSID Convention.

6. Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention requires contracting states to “recognize
an award rendered pursuant to [the] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations
imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.”

7. To fulfill this obligation, the United States passed implementing legislation that
provides:

An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of

the [ICSID] convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of
the United States. The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an

Case 1:18-cv-11291-LTS Document1 Filed 06/20/18 Page 3 of 5

award shall be enforced and shall be given the same full faith and
credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court of general
jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration
Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards
rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] convention.

22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

8. In addition, the ICSID Convention provides that awards rendered pursuant to the
Convention may not be challenged except by application to the Secretary-General of ICSID for
annulment. No such application has been made in this case.

B. The ICSID Award.

9. On December 5, 2011, Al Tamimi filed a request for arbitration against Oman
with ICSID (“Request for Arbitration”). In his Request for Arbitration, Al Tamimi alleged that
Oman had breached the Agreement between the Government of the United States of America
and the Government of the Sultanate of Oman on the Establishment of a Free Trade Area (“US-
Oman FTA”). Al Tamimi’s allegations related to a failed limestone mining project he had begun
in Oman.

10. ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration on December 23, 2011, and the
arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal’”) was duly constituted on April 25, 2012. The parties then
engaged in discovery and each made two written submissions on jurisdiction and the merits of
the case. The parties’ submissions included legal memoranda, expert reports, and witness
statements. In-person hearings on jurisdiction and the merits were then conducted in London
from April 28, 2014 through May 8, 2014, and included oral testimony of expert and fact
witnesses and legal submissions from each party’s counsel. After the hearings, the parties made
further written submissions in response to questions from the Tribunal. The government of the

United States of America, which was not a party to the dispute, also filed a written submission

regarding the interpretation of the US-Oman FTA.

11. The Tribunal issued its Award on November 3, 2015, unanimously finding that it
had jurisdiction over the dispute and that Al Tamimi’s claims were “entirely unmeritorious.”
The Tribunal dismissed all of Al Tamimi’s claims and directed him to pay to Oman costs of
$5,677,410.24, seventy-five percent of the total costs Oman had claimed. The Tribunal further
directed Al Tamimi to pay to Oman interest on the awarded costs starting sixty days after the
date of the Award (or from January 2, 2016) at the 91-day U.S. Treasury Bill rate, compounded
quarterly. Al Tamimi has not paid any part of the costs the Tribunal ordered him to pay in the
Award.
