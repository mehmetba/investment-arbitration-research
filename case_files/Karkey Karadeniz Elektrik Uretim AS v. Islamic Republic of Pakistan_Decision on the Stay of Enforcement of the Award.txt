(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

INTRODUCTION

A. The Parties

The applicant in this annulment proceeding is the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (“Pakistan”
or “Applicant’”). Pakistan is represented by Mr. Ahmad I. Aslam, the Head of the
International Disputes Unit of the Office of the Attorney-General of Pakistan in Islamabad;
Dr. Ignacio Torterola, Ms. Mariana Lozza, Mr. Guillermo Moro and Mr. Gary Shaw of
GST LLP in Washington, DC; and Dr. Diego Brian Gosis, Mr. Quinn Smith, Ms. Veronica
Lavista and Ms. Katherine Sanoja of GST LLP in Miami.

The respondent in this annulment proceeding is Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S.
(“Karkey’), a company organised under the laws of Turkey. Karkey is represented by Mr.
Paolo Di Rosa and Mr. Lawrence A. Schneider of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP in
Washington, DC; Mr. David Reed and Mr. Monty Taylor of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer
(UK) LLP in London; Mr. Anton A. Ware, Ms. Amy Endicott and Mr. John Muse-Fisher
of Arnold & Porter Kaye Scholer LLP in San Francisco; Ms. Maria Chedid of Baker &
McKenzie LLP in San Francisco; Mr. Nicholas O. Kennedy of Baker & McKenzie LLP in
Dallas; and Mr. Syed Ahmad Hassan Shah of Hassan Kaunain Nafees, Legal Practitioners

& Advisers in Islamabad.

B. The Present Decision

This Decision addresses the question of whether the stay of enforcement should be
terminated or should continue until the ad hoc Committee (the “Committee”) issues the
decision on annulment. The Committee first sets out the Parties’ respective requests
(Section II) and the relevant procedural history (Section IIT). In Section IV, the Committee
summarizes the Parties’ positions, both on the relevant standards for the stay of
enforcement and on application of these standards to the present case. The Committee then
provides its considerations and conclusions in Section V and, finally, sets out its Decision

in Section VI.

Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding
Cc. The Committee’s Terminology and Reasoning

The Committee has carefully examined all the arguments and evidence presented by the
Parties. The Committee does not consider it necessary to reiterate in this Decision all such
arguments or evidence, which are well known to the Parties. The Committee discusses only
those parts of the submissions which it considers most relevant for its conclusions.
Therefore, insofar as any matter has not been specifically identified or recorded in the body

of this Decision, this does not mean that it has not been fully considered.

The Parties have extensively referred to decisions of other ICSID ad hoc committees. The
Committee has considered these decisions and the Parties’ arguments based upon them to
the extent that they shed useful light on the issues at stake here. In view of the considerable
number of the decisions accumulated by now regarding the stay of enforcement, and the
diversity among them, it is obvious that the Committee cannot accept and come out in line
with all conclusions in these earlier decisions. In its reasoning, the Committee will refer to
only some of these decisions which it considers to be of particular relevance for its own

conclusions in the present Decision.

THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF RELATING TO THE STAY OF
ENFORCEMENT

A. Pakistan’s Application for Annulment

On 27 October 2017, Pakistan filed an application (the “Annulment Application”)
seeking annulment of the award rendered on 22 August 2017 (the “Award’’) in the original
arbitration Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan (ICSID
Case No. ARB/13/1).

Pakistan’ s request for relief in the Annulment Application includes a request “that the stay
of enforcement of the Award be granted until the ad hoc Committee issue[s] its decision
on this request for annulment, in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and

Arbitration Rule 54.”!

Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

8. In relation to this request, the Annulment Application states that

B.

Pakistan reserves its right to present arguments before the ad hoc
Committee with regard to its request that the enforcement of the
Award be stayed, including the reasons why such stay of
enforcement should be maintained until the Committee decides on
the request for annulment, in the procedural calendar that the
Committee establishes if it considers necessary.”

Pakistan’s Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement

9. In its submissions on the stay of enforcement, Pakistan requests that the ad hoc Committee:

Cc.

(a) Accept into the record the formal declaration presented by
Pakistan Attorney General;

(b) Reject Karkey’s request that the Stay of Enforcement of the
Award be terminated;

(c) Maintain the Stay of Enforcement of the Award until the ad hoc
Committee issues its decision on Pakistan’s Request for Annulment
without security;

(d) Order Karkey to pay for all costs and fees of the proceeding.*

Karkey’s Submissions on the Stay of Enforcement

10. In Karkey’s submissions on the stay of enforcement, it requests that the ad hoc Committee:

a. Decline to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award;

b. Alternatively, require Pakistan, on the one hand, to provide
security for the payment of the Award in the form of, (a) an
unconditional and irrevocable bank guarantee or standby letter of
credit ... (b) an appropriately capitalized escrow account ... or
(c) any other form that the Committee determines is just and
reasonable in the circumstances, and on the other hand, to pay the
costs to maintain the Alican Bey and the Iraq while the stay
continues.

c. Impose on Pakistan all costs and attorney’s fees incurred in this
proceeding in connection with the issue of the stay of enforcement.*

Ill. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

11. On 27 October 2017, Pakistan filed the Annulment Application with the International
Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) pursuant to Article 52 of the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States (the “Convention”) and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for

Arbitration Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”).

12. On 7 November 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Annulment
Application and so notified the Parties. The Secretary-General’s notice stated the following

regarding the provisional stay of enforcement:

The Application for Annulment contains a request for a stay of the
enforcement of the Award, pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID
Convention. ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2) provides that the
Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration of
the Application for Annulment, inform the parties of the provisional
stay of the Award. Accordingly, I hereby notify you that the
enforcement of the Award is provisionally stayed.

13. On 5 December 2017, the Committee was constituted in accordance with Article 52(3) of
the Convention. Its members are Prof. Dr. Karl-Heinz Bockstiegel (German), serving as

President, Mr. Cavinder Bull (Singaporean) and Ms. Dorothy Ufot (Nigerian). All

members were appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council.

14. On 6 December 2017, the Committee consulted the Parties regarding arrangements for the
first session. The Committee proposed to hold the first session in person and informed the
Parties that the Members would be available for a meeting in Europe on 5 February 2018.
Both Parties subsequently confirmed their availability and agreed that the first session

would be held in Paris on that date.

1S.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

By letter of 19 December 2017, Pakistan made the following statement and request

regarding the stay of enforcement:

Pakistan notes that the Award is currently stayed as provided for by
the Secretary General in the Notice of Registration of November 7,
2017. Pakistan additionally notes that, unless Karkey requests that
the stay be terminated in the terms of Arbitration Rule 54(2), second
paragraph, the stay shall be continued until a decision on the request
is rendered.

Accordingly, Pakistan respectfully requests that the Committee
confirm this understanding, and hold Karkey responsible for any
fees and expenses [and eventually damages] incurred by Pakistan or
its instrumentalities if any attempts at enforcement of the Award are
undertaken.

On 28 December 2017, the ICSID Secretariat circulated a draft agenda for the first session
and a draft Procedural Order No. 1 to facilitate the Parties’ discussion on procedural issues

in advance of the first session.

Upon the invitation of the Committee, Karkey responded to Pakistan’s letter of 19
December 2017 on 2 January 2018. Karkey argued that Pakistan had “misinterpret[ed] the
relevant ICSID norms governing the stay of enforcement of awards,” and set out what it
considers the proper interpretation of Article 52(5) of the Convention and Arbitration Rule
54. In addition, Karkey stated that “[f]or avoidance of doubt, Karkey hereby formally
requests termination of the stay.” In light of this request, Karkey stated that the stay would
automatically terminate within 30 days pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2), unless the
Committee decided to continue the stay before then. In this regard, Karkey made the

following proposal:

However, should the Committee wish for the Parties to address the
stay orally at the 5 February 2018 hearing, and given the need for
some time after such hearing for the Committee to make a decision,
Karkey would not oppose the granting of (i) an additional period of
7 days after the hearing for the Committee to issue its decision
without opinion (i.e., a decision whether or not the stay should
continue, absent which the stay would be automatically terminated
pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2)); and (ii) a further 14 days from
the decision for the Committee to issue an opinion setting forth its
reasoning.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

In the same letter, Karkey proposed a briefing schedule for the Parties’ submission on the

stay of enforcement.

On 3 January 2018, the Committee set the following schedule for the Parties’ submissions
on the stay of enforcement, which would allow for two rounds of written submissions in

advance of the first session on 5 February 2018:

e The Parties shall submit simultaneous briefs (with a limit of 25
pages) on Friday, 12 January 2018.

e The Parties shall submit simultaneous reply briefs (with a limit
of 15 pages) on Friday, 26 January 2018.

e Following the first session on Monday, 5 February 2018, the
Committee will hold an oral discussion on the stay of
enforcement, during which each Party will be permitted to make
an introductory oral submission of no more than 30 minutes.

By letter of 4 January 2018, Pakistan requested that the Committee amend this procedure.
Karkey submitted that the Committee had ruled on Karkey’s letter of 2 January 2018
without providing Pakistan the opportunity to respond. Pakistan then provided its response
to Karkey’s letter, arguing that Karkey had misinterpreted the relevant provisions. Pakistan
proposed that, because Karkey had requested termination of the stay, Karkey should first
present its reasons for termination, followed by Pakistan’s response, a second round of
pleadings, and then oral arguments of 45 minutes each with Karkey presenting first.

Pakistan also offered an alternative proposal.
With regard to the automatic termination of the stay, Pakistan stated that

ICSID annulment committees routinely continue the stay of
enforcement of the award until the parties have presented their
submissions on the issue and a decision has been reached. In fact, it
is highly unusual, if not unheard of, for an ad hoc committee to make
a decision on stay of enforcement within the 30-day period of
Arbitration Rule 54(2).

After considering Pakistan’s comments, the Committee responded on 6 January 2018. The
Committee decided not to amend the written briefing schedule, noting that Pakistan had

already had a number of opportunities to make submissions on the stay of enforcement,

beginning in the Annulment Application. With regard to the Parties’ oral submissions, the
Committee specified that Pakistan would present first and that, in addition to making a 30-
minute introductory presentation, each Party would have a further 15 minutes to present

any rebuttal statement.

In accordance with the Committee’s briefing schedule, on 12 January 2018, Pakistan filed
its first submission on the stay of enforcement, including Exhibits AP-001 to AP-027 and
Legal Authorities APL-001 to APL-024 (“Pakistan’s First Submission’), and Karkey
filed its first submission on the stay of enforcement, including Exhibits AC-001 to AC-
007, C-001 and C-287 and Legal Authorities ACL-001 to ACL-024 (“Karkey’s First

Submission’).

Also on 12 January 2018, the Parties provided their joint comments on Procedural Order

No. 1. The Parties provided an updated version of their joint comments on 16 January 2018.

On 17 January 2018, the Parties informed the Committee that they had agreed to extend
the page limit for their second round of submissions on the stay of enforcement to 20 pages.

The following day, the Committee confirmed that the page limit was extended as agreed.

On 26 January 2018, the Parties filed their reply submissions on the stay of enforcement.
Pakistan filed its reply submission with Exhibits AP-028 to AP-031 and Legal Authorities
APL-025 to APL-033 (“Pakistan’s Reply Submission”). Karkey filed its submission with
Exhibits AC-008 and C-006 and Legal Authorities ACL-025 to ACL-029 (“Karkey’s
Reply Submission”).

On 5 February 2018, the Committee held the first session and hearing on the stay of
enforcement at the Word Bank office in Paris, France. The following individuals attended

the meeting:

During the meeting, the Committee informed the Parties that it would issue a reasoned
decision on the stay of enforcement as soon as possible after the first session. The
Committee confirmed that the provisional stay of enforcement of the Award shall remain

in effect until the Committee issues its decision on the stay.

The Parties made oral submissions on the stay of enforcement as scheduled. In addition,
each Party submitted a PowerPoint presentation to accompany its introductory statement

(“Pakistan’s Presentation” and “Karkey’s Presentation’).

An audio recording and written transcript of the first session were made, deposited in

ICSID’s archives, and distributed to the Parties and the Committee.

Following the first session, on 6 February 2018, the Committee provided the Parties with

an updated draft of Procedural Order No. 1, reflecting the agreements and decisions

discussed during the session, as well as the Committee’s decisions on the outstanding
issues reached in its deliberations. The Parties were invited to consider the contents of the

revised draft and submit any final comments.

On 9 February 2018, Pakistan submitted a letter from its Attorney-General stating that
“Pakistan shall abide by and comply with the Award in conformity with Article 53 of the
ICSID Convention, if it is not annulled”, and offering to provide further assurances in this

regard if required by the Committee.

Upon the invitation of the Committee, Karkey responded to the Attorney-General’s letter
on 13 February 2018. Karkey submitted a letter, Exhibits AC-009 to AC-012 and Legal
Authorities ACL-030 to ACL-031. Later that day, Pakistan submitted a request for leave

to respond to Karkey’s letter, which the Committee subsequently granted.

Also on 13 February 2018, the Parties jointly submitted minor comments on the revised

draft of Procedural Order No. 1, and each Party submitted a proposed procedural timetable.

On 16 February 2018, Pakistan submitted its response to Karkey’s letter of 13 February
2018, together with Exhibits AP-032 to AP-034 and Legal Authority APL-034.

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

A. Pakistan’s Position

Pakistan submits that the stay of enforcement should be continued until the Committee
issues its decision on the Annulment Application. According to Pakistan, Karkey is the
moving Party and bears the burden of proof, which it has failed to meet. In any event,
Pakistan argues that the circumstances in this case require the continuation of the stay.

Pakistan also opposes Karkey’s request for security as a condition for continuing the stay.

Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan

 

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding
() Moving Party and Burden of Proof

37. In Pakistan’s view, Karkey is the moving Party because it stated in its letter of 2 January
2018 that “Karkey hereby formally requests termination of the stay.”> Pakistan
acknowledges that it initially requested the stay in the Annulment Application, but
considers that Karkey, by requesting termination of the stay, “superseded Pakistan’s
request and bore the burden of proof set out in Rule 54(4).”®

38. According to Pakistan, the language of Arbitration Rule 54(4) makes clear that the moving
Party bears the burden of proof.’ That provision states that a “request pursuant to
paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the

stay or its modification or termination.”*

39. In addition, Pakistan cites previous decisions of ICSID ad hoc Committees to support its
position, including the decisions in Enron v. Argentina and Occidental v. Ecuador.?
Pakistan states that in each of these cases, the applicant initially requested a stay of
enforcement, but before the committee ruled on that request, the respondent on annulment
requested termination of the stay. Therefore, the committee placed the burden of proof on

the party requesting termination. !°

40. Pakistan accepts that the ad hoc committees in Burlington v. Ecuador and Pezold v.

Zimbabwe placed the burden on the applicant State, but Pakistan explains that this is

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

 

because the respondent on annulment had merely opposed the State’s request for the stay,

rather than formally requesting termination of the stay.!!

Al. Therefore, Pakistan’s position is that Karkey must prove that there are specific

circumstances that require the stay to be terminated. !?

(2) Applicable Legal Standard

42. Pakistan notes that ad hoc committees have considered the following specific
circumstances in considering whether a stay should be lifted, as set forth in the ICSID

Background Paper on Annulment:

the risk of non-recovery of sums due under the award if the award
is annulled, non-compliance with the award if the award is not
annulled, any history of non-compliance with other awards or failure
to pay advances to cover the costs of arbitration proceedings,
adverse economic consequences on either party and the balance of
both parties’ interests. '>

43. However, in Pakistan’s view, ad hoc committees are not in fact competent to address the
issue of potential compliance with the Award.'4 Further, in accordance with “general
principles of good faith and the practice of international courts and tribunals,” committees
should assume that a State will comply with its international obligations. !> Pakistan points
out that the Convention regulates compliance with ICSID awards and provides mechanisms

for guaranteeing a State’s compliance. '®

Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan
(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

 

44. More generally, Pakistan relies on the statement of the ad hoc committee in Libananco v.
Turkey that an “Applicant’s interest in a continued stay of enforcement pending the
outcome of the annulment proceeding should be given more weight than Respondent’s
interest in immediate enforcement.”!7 According to Pakistan, ad hoc Committees have
decided to continue the stay of enforcement in the majority of ICSID cases; of the 41
decisions on stay of enforcement issued as of April 2016, 36 granted the stay of

enforcement. '*

45. Pakistan argues that the few cases in which committees terminated the stay of enforcement
involved circumstances not present in this case, such as high-ranking officials expressly
refusing to comply with ICSID awards, domestic legal systems contrary to compliance,

t,!9

other creditors seeking to collect awards against the applicant,’ or an applicant’s failure

to fulfil payment obligations in ICSID proceedings.”°

(3) Circumstances that Require the Stay in this Case

46. Pakistan submits that the stay must be continued because: (a) the Annulment Application
is made in good faith; (b) there is no risk that Pakistan will not comply with its obligations
under the Convention; (c) Pakistan has committed to comply with the Award; (d) Karkey
would not suffer hardship if the Award were stayed; and (e) Pakistan would suffer hardship

47. First, Pakistan argues that the Annulment Application is fully justified and not dilatory, as
asserted by Karkey.”! For Pakistan, this is evident from the fact that it submitted the

Annulment Application just 65 days after the Award was issued. Pakistan considers that it

has “requested annulment in good faith forced by the many annullable defects in the
Award.””? Further, Pakistan points out that it agreed to a procedural schedule in which
written submissions on annulment will be completed within ten months. Therefore, “the

continued stay of enforcement can be expected to be of relatively short duration.”?>

48. Second, according to Pakistan, there is no risk that Pakistan will not comply with its
obligations under the Convention and pay the Award if it is not annulled. In particular,

Pakistan asserts the following:

a. Pakistan has consistently complied with its international obligations in general and with
the ICSID Convention specifically. There is no evidence to the contrary, and most
ICSID cases against Pakistan have been settled and discontinued.”* In fact, there has
not been a single ICSID award rendered against Pakistan, except the Award in this

case.”

b. The Kaya Bey incident does not establish a “track record” of non-compliance as Karkey
suggests. Rather, because the Kaya Bey has now been released in accordance with the
Tribunal’s decision on provisional measures, the Committee should consider it an

example of Pakistan’s compliance with orders in ICSID proceedings.”°

c. Karkey’s discussion of Pakistan’s local courts is misplaced because there is no reason
Karkey would need to turn to the Pakistani court system to enforce the Award; ICSID

awards are complied with voluntarily rather than enforced before the Respondent’s

courts.2” In any event, the decisions of Pakistani courts reflect Pakistan’s commitment

to the ICSID Convention.”*

Third, although Pakistan rejects Karkey’s suggestion that Pakistan must undertake to
comply with the Award, it has provided written confirmation to that effect.?? Specifically,
Pakistan has filed a letter from the Attorney-General for Pakistan stating the following (the

“Attorney-General’s Statement”):

As the Attorney-General for the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, I
declare and confirm that Pakistan recognizes its international
obligations in accordance with international law. Pakistan actively
participates in international dispute settlement systems, arbitral and
judicial processes, and complies with its obligations in those
proceedings. I also declare and confirm that Pakistani law is
compatible with the ICSID Convention, which it explicitly
incorporated in the Arbitration (International Investment Disputes)
Act, 2011.

Pakistan strongly believes that its Request for Annulment of the
Award and its request for confirmation of the stay of enforcement
should be granted. In case, however, the Award is not annulled,
Pakistan hereby undertakes to recognize the Award rendered by the
Arbitral Tribunal as binding and will enforce the pecuniary
obligations imposed by that award.*”

Further, during Pakistan’s oral submissions, the Additional Attorney-General confirmed
that Pakistan is fully committed to voluntarily complying with the award if it is not
annulled.*! He also stated that Pakistan is “willing to provide a further declaration by the
Attorney-General to address any concerns that the members of the committee might have

in this regard.”*? This Attorney-General confirmed this offer in a subsequent letter.

Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan
(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

Fourth, Pakistan argues that continuing the stay would not cause any hardship for Karkey.
Regarding Karkey’s allegations of the costs related to the Alican Bey and Iraq, Pakistan
considers Karkey’s arguments an “attempt to repackage and reuse” damages claims
advanced in the original proceeding.** In Pakistan’s view, “the only viable hardship that
Karkey has claimed is the small maintenance costs required for the Alican Bey, which
Pakistan will take ownership of if the Award is not annulled.”* In that case, Karkey will
be entitled to 12% interest on several of the amounts awarded until the Award is satisfied,
which will cover any maintenance costs incurred in the meantime.*° Indeed, Pakistan
points out that the Award, if not annulled, will have generated hundreds of millions of
dollars of interest in favour of Karkey.*° This will serve to compensate Karkey for any

delay in payment.*”

Fifth, Pakistan argues that it would suffer hardship if the stay were terminated.** In this

context, Pakistan alleges the following:

a. Pakistan would have to pay the significant amount of the Award by diverting public

funds from its annual budget, causing hardship to its population.*°

b. This hardship would only worsen if the Award were annulled and Karkey were to delay
repayment of the funds. Karkey has provided no evidence or assurances to show its

ability or willingness to repay the Award promptly.*?

c. Ifthe Award were annulled, Pakistan would face significant legal fees in attempting to
enforce the annulment decision and recover amounts paid, and there is no guarantee

that such proceedings would succeed.*!

(4) Security for the Award

Pakistan opposes Karkey’s request that the Committee require Pakistan to provide a
security or guarantee for the Award as a condition of continuing the stay. Pakistan argues
that such a security or guarantee is (a) beyond the Committee’s competence, and (b) in any

event, inappropriate in this case.

According to Pakistan, Karkey, as the Party requesting the security, bears the burden of

proving why such security should be granted.*?

a. The Committee’s Authority to Order Security

Pakistan’ s position is that there is no basis in the Convention, when properly interpreted in
accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the
“VCLT”), or in the Arbitration Rules for an ad hoc committee to order an applicant to post
security as a condition of continuing the stay.*? Nor is a committee able to order such
security as a provisional measure, as Article 47 of the Convention concerning provisional
measures is not among the provisions that apply mutatis mutandis to annulment

proceedings.

Pakistan cites the decisions of previous committees that interpreted the Convention and

determined that it does not permit a committee to order security for an award. Specifically,

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

Pakistan endorses the interpretation of the committee in Azurix v. Argentina, which found

that

To apply a strict rule that the price for the stay is the provision of
security ... would be in derogation to the approach to interpretation
reflected in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention and also would
work in a de facto sense impermissibly to amend the ICSID
Convention by substituting a new and absolute enforcement
mechanism for the qualified provisions of the Convention itself.*>

While Pakistan acknowledges that some committees have conditioned the stay on the
provision of security, it argues that this area of law has not crystallized, and that the

Committee need not follow those decisions. ‘®

Pakistan also cites the statement of the committee in El Paso v. Argentina that requiring
the State to provide a guarantee “would be tantamount to punishing [the State] for having
applied for the annulment of the award. Clearly, such sanction is not provided for in the

ICSID Convention and rules.”“”

In addition, Pakistan relies on the travaux préparatoires of the Convention, which shows
that an early draft included the possibility that an ad hoc committee could require a security
as a condition for the stay, but that this provision was later removed.** For Pakistan, this

indicates that there was no agreement among the drafters to grant committees this power.*”

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

 

b. Whether Conditioning the Stay on Security is Appropriate

60. Pakistan contends that, in any event, requiring it to post a security is inappropriate because
the security would (a) unduly benefit Karkey, (b) add a cost to a request for annulment,

and (c) possibly be subject to enforcement proceedings by third parties.

6l. Regarding undue benefit to Karkey, Pakistan submits that this imbalance has been
recognised by several committees, including in the cases Mitchell v. DRC,*° MINE v.

Guinea,>! Occidental v. Ecuador and Enron v. Argentina.”

62. In Pakistan’s view, “[t]here are simply no legal or factual reasons that would allow the
Committee to put Karkey in a better position because Pakistan validly exercised its rights

under the Convention and seek annulment of the Award.”*4

63. Pakistan also submits that requiring it to post security would place a heavy burden on the
State. It would force Pakistan to set aside a significant sum pending the annulment
proceeding, even though the Award may eventually be annulled.* In addition, as noted by
the committee in MINE v. Guinea, posting security may involve a “very heavy expenditure

for the fees of the guaranteeing bank” and “freezing the amount of the Award and the

interest accruing thereon.”*° Pakistan argues that this burden would impede its right to seek

annulment of the Award.>”

Furthermore, Pakistan considers that there is “an actual risk” that any funds Pakistan is
required to provide as security or place in escrow might be subject to attachment by third-
parties, which would cause irreparable harm.** Pakistan cites the decision in Enron v.
Argentina, in which the committee recognized the risk that such funds would then be
irrecoverable by the applicant in the event that the award is annulled, and stated that “where
that risk is very high ... that fact will militate strongly against lifting the stay or against

requiring security to be provided as a condition of any continuation of the stay.”*?

B. Karkey’s Position

Karkey submits that the Committee should deny Pakistan’s request for continuation of the
stay of enforcement, or in the alternative, order Pakistan to provide security as a condition
for continuation of the stay. In support of this position, Karkey argues that Pakistan, as the
party seeking continuation of the stay, bears the burden of establishing specific
circumstances that require the stay, and has failed to do so. In Karkey’s view, all the

relevant circumstances justify termination of the provisional stay.

(1) Moving Party and Burden of Proof

Karkey rejects what it considers Pakistan’s attempt to improperly shift the burden of proof.
Karkey points out that in the Annulment Application, Pakistan stated that it “respectfully
requests that the enforcement of the Award be stayed until the ad hoc Committee decides
on this request for annulment.”°° Accordingly, in Karkey’s view, the “stay would not have

been an issue at all in this proceeding had Pakistan not requested it; Karkey is therefore

merely reacting to, and opposing, Pakistan’s proposal to continue the stay.”°! For Karkey,
this means that Pakistan bears the burden of justifying its request, following the principle

onus actori incumbit probation.”

67. Karkey rejects Pakistan’s interpretation of Arbitration Rule 54(4), which provides that a
“request pursuant to paragraph ... (2) (second sentence) ... shall specify the circumstances
that require the stay or its modification or termination.” Karkey contends that this provision
merely requires each party to articulate its position supporting or opposing the stay; it does
not alter the burden of proof.°? As noted by the committee in Standard Chartered v.
TESCO, “it is for the award debtor to advance grounds (supported as necessary by
evidence) for the stay. If the award creditor disputes these grounds, it must also advance

evidence in support of any ‘positive allegations’ that it makes.”

68. According to Karkey, ad hoc committees have consistently held that the party seeking

continuation of the stay bears the burden of proof. For example, the committee in von
Pezold v. Zimbabwe stated that “[i]t is for the party requesting continuation of the stay to
establish that there are circumstances that require such continuation; it is not for the

counterparty to show that there are ‘exceptional circumstances’ that require the lifting of

the stay.” In Burlington v. Ecuador, the committee rejected the applicant’s attempt to

reverse the burden of proof.®”

69. Karkey contends that the decisions in Enron v. Argentina and Occidental v. Ecuador, cited
by Pakistan, do not support Pakistan’s argument that the party resisting the stay bears the
burden of proof; they “merely stand for the proposition that an award creditor is required

to support allegations that the award debtor is unlikely to comply with the award.”°*

(2) Applicable Legal Standard

70. Karkey submits that a “stay in the enforcement of an award is an exceptional remedy under
the ICSID Convention,” and should not be granted lightly.© For Karkey, it is notable that
the default rule under Arbitration Rule 54(5) is that a stay automatically terminates unless

the Committee decides to continue it.”°

71. Thus, Karkey rejects Pakistan’s suggestion that continuation of the stay is standard practice
or essentially automatic.’! Rather, most ad hoc committees considering the issue have
either terminated the stay or set conditions for its continuation.” According to Karkey, the
trend in recent ICSID cases illustrates the exceptional nature of the stay. Of the 21 publicly-
available decisions on the stay of enforcement that were issued from 2013 to 2017, seven

rejected the stay of enforcement, nine granted stays subject to conditions (five required

security and four required a written undertaking), one partially terminated the stay, and

only four decisions granted the stay unconditionally.”

72. Further, Karkey contends that Pakistan’s position contradicts the terms of Article 52(5) of
the Convention and Arbitration Rule 54, which direct ad hoc committees to determine
whether a stay is “required” based on the specific “circumstances” of the case.” Karkey
stresses the use of the word “require” in Article 52(5) and Arbitration Rule 54(4), citing

the statement of the committee in SGS v. Paraguay that

Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention provides that the stay shall
only be continued if the Committee considers that “the
circumstances so require”. The Convention does not use other less

categorical verbs, such as “recommend”, “deserve”, “justify” or

similar words, but resorts to the imperative verb “require”.’>

73. In Karkey’s view, it is also critical that Article 52(2) of the Convention uses the permissive
term “may” regarding committees’ power to stay enforcement of the award, thereby
granting committees full discretion to “terminate a stay even if circumstances favour a

stay.”76

74. Karkey notes that neither the Convention nor the Arbitration Rules indicate the nature of
the circumstances requiring continuation of a stay, but that committees have considered a

range of circumstances, including:

e The risk of irreparable prejudice or catastrophic consequences
for the award debtor if the stay were terminated;

e The prospects of recoupment of monies paid to the award
creditor if annulment were to succeed;

e The risk of non-compliance with the award by the award debtor;

e The risk of harm to the award creditor if the stay were
continued.””

75. With respect to the first criterion listed above (harm to the award debtor), Karkey argues
that the standard is high and that “[s]uch allegations must be substantiated by ‘specific

evidence and data’ that give rise to a ‘particularized fear’ of catastrophic immediate

harm.”78

76. Regarding the third criterion listed above (the possibility of non-compliance with an
award), Karkey rejects Pakistan’s contention that the Committee does not have the power
to assess the risk that Pakistan will not comply with the Award if it is not annulled.”

Karkey contends that numerous ad hoc committees have considered this a relevant factor.®°

3) Circumstances that Require the Stay in this Case

77. Karkey submits that in this case, all the relevant circumstances support a decision to
terminate the provisional stay of enforcement. In particular, Karkey argues that (a) there is
a significant risk that Pakistan will not comply with the Award if it is upheld; (b) Pakistan
has failed to meaningfully commit to complying with the Award; (c) if the Award were
annulled, Pakistan would not suffer irreparable harm; and (d) continuing the stay would

cause hardship for Karkey.

Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan
(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

 

78. First, Karkey asserts that Pakistan’s previous conduct shows an unwillingness to comply
with its obligations toward Karkey and obligations under the ICSID Convention, and thus
casts significant doubt on whether Pakistan would honour the Award if it is upheld.*!

Karkey advances several allegations in this regard, including:

a. During the original proceeding, Pakistan engaged in dilatory tactics. As a result, the
tribunal rendered a cost award of US$10 million against Pakistan, noting that “Pakistan

seemed to be trying to delay and disrupt the[] proceedings.”*?

b. Pakistan refused to comply with the tribunal’s provisional measures decision ordering
release of the Kaya Bey for seven months, contrary to Article 47 of the ICSID
Convention.*? The Sindh High Court in Pakistan declined to recognize the effect of the

tribunal’s decision.*4

c. In 2002, the Supreme Court of Pakistan restrained the claimant in SGS v. Pakistan from

pursuing its ICSID arbitration against the State.*°

d. Pakistan disregarded a sovereign guarantee that accompanied the contract at issue in
the original arbitration, even though it had been signed on behalf of the President for

and on behalf of the State.°°

79. Karkey acknowledges that Pakistan has no history of non-compliance with ICSID awards,
but it does not find comfort in this fact because no awards have been rendered against

Pakistan. *” In this regard, Karkey’s counsel stated that “we don’t know whether they would

comply or not. The only thing we have to go by is their record of compliance with Tribunal

decisions in our case.”** According to Karkey:

Pakistan has breached every important commitment it has made to
Karkey from the very start of the parties’ relationship ... leaving no
doubt that at every opportunity presented to it Pakistan will breach,
delay and defy, and if given more time under a stay in these
proceedings, will undoubtedly seek to reposition its assets in a
manner that would make enforcement by Karkey even more
difficult.*

80. Second, Karkey argues that although the Convention requires Pakistan to voluntarily
comply with the Award, Pakistan has not meaningfully confirmed its intention or ability to
pay the Award if it is not annulled.*° In its written submissions, Karkey complained that
Pakistan had “not committed to honor the Award.”°! After Pakistan filed the Attorney-
General’s Statement, Karkey argued that this confirmation was not reliable because it
merely restates Pakistan’s obligation under Article 54 of the Convention.*” According to
Karkey, ad hoc committees in annulment proceedings involving Argentina considered such
“comfort letters” insufficient to justify a stay of enforcement.”? Karkey submits that
additional written commitments by Pakistan would be similarly unreliable, in light of

Pakistan’ s record of non-compliance with its obligations to Karkey.”*

81. Third, Karkey’s position is that Pakistan has not proven that it would suffer irreparable
harm if the stay were terminated. In response to Pakistan’s allegation that its population
would be harmed if funds were diverted from its annual budget to pay the Award, Karkey
asserts that Pakistan has failed to substantiate this allegation, and in any event, a general
impact on Pakistan’s budget would not justify the stay.°° In Karkey’s view, “if a general
impact on a State’s budget were sufficient to require a stay, a stay would become, in

essence, automatic whenever the award debtor is a State.”°”

82. In response to Pakistan’s concern that it may not recoup any amount paid to Karkey if the
Award were annulled, Karkey offers to maintain any sums collected in an escrow account
until the Committee issues its decision on annulment.** According to Karkey, this offer
should entirely alleviate Pakistan’s concerns about difficulty recovering amounts paid

under the Award.

83. Fourth, according to Karkey, it would suffer serious harm if the Committee were to

continue the stay. In particular, Karkey alleges the following potential harms:

e Continued delay in collecting the amount of the Award and
putting those funds to productive uses;

e Reduced standing with creditors and insurers;

e Continuing maintenance costs for the Alican Bey and the Iraq;
and

e Continuing harassment in connection with stewardship of the
Alican Bey and the Iraq.”

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding
(4) Security for the Award

84. As an alternative, Karkey requests that the Committee continue the stay on the condition
that Karkey post “full and inescapable” security for the Award.'°° Karkey proposes the
following possible forms of security: (a) a standby letter of credit, (b) an unconditional

bank guarantee, or (c) an escrow account pledged in favour of Karkey.

85. In all cases, Karkey requests that Pakistan bear the costs of the security and that Pakistan
also be ordered to pay the costs to maintain the Alican Bey and the Iraq, as well as any
other costs associated with Karkey’s continued ownership of those vessels, during the

pendency of the stay.!°!

a. The Committee’s Authority to Order Security

86. Karkey rejects Pakistan’s argument that ad hoc committees lack competence to condition
continuation of a stay on provision of security by the award debtor. According to Karkey,
this power is “implied [in the Convention] as a lesser included power within the broad
discretion granted to decide whether to stay enforcement pending annulment.”!°? Karkey
argues that several committees have expressly considered and rejected the arguments raised

by Pakistan on this issue. '°°

87. Karkey points out that conditional stays are in fact common; of the 46 decisions on stays
of enforcement that committees have issued, 23 granted the stay with conditions (14
required security in the form of bank guarantee or escrow, and 9 required a written
undertaking).'™4 As stated by the committee in Standard Charter v. Tanzania, “weight must
be given to the fact that a sizable group of committees have ordered stays conditional on

the provision of security.”!°°

b. Whether Conditioning the Stay on Security is Appropriate

88. Karkey submits that under the Convention, the status quo would be immediate payment of
the Award, and it is therefore “fair and just to require security in exchange for a continued

stay.”!°° In Karkey’s view, the benefits of a security are as follows:

a. Security ensures the effectiveness of awards. '!°’ Committees have held that where there
is a risk of non-payment of the award, the stay should be conditioned upon security to

protect against that risk.!°* In the present case, there is a significant risk that Pakistan

 

will not voluntarily comply with the Award if it is not annulled, despite its obligation

under the Convention. '°

b. Requiring security for the award may “serve as a possible deterrent to requests for

annulment that are motivated primarily by a desire to delay and, possibly, to avoid

compliance.”!!°

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

According to Karkey, amount of the Award in this case favours provision of security.

During oral statements, Karkey’s counsel elaborated as follows:

As the Repsol committee explained, those cases that have refused
security have largely been cases where the award at issue was
relatively small. This makes sense, as it naturally would be easier
for a state to pay or a Claimant to locate and seize assets to satisfy a
smaller award. Here the sheer size of the award makes it even more
unlikely that Pakistan will comply with its payment obligations. '!!

Karkey considers Pakistan’s concerns regarding the security unfounded. First, Karkey does
not accept that requiring a security would expose Pakistan to any additional risk. This is
because the security would operate only if the Award were not annulled, and as such, there
is no concern about recouping amounts paid if the Award is annulled.'!? Indeed, in
Karkey’s view, the provision of security could be seen to reduce Pakistan’s risk, as

compliance with the Award is delayed pending the decision on annulment.'!*

Second, Karkey argues that any risk of attachment of the security by third-parties is
irrelevant to the Committee’s decision on the stay, and in any event, there is no such risk.
In this regard, Karkey cites the committee in Sempra v. Argentina, which did not “see why
its decision should be influenced by any desire to shield assets from being attached to
satisfy any indebtedness to third parties.”''+ Karkey also points to Pakistan’s own statement
that there is not a “long list of creditors seeking to collect award amounts against
Pakistan.” ''> In any case, Karkey asserts that there is no risk of attachment associated with
a letter of credit or guarantee because collateral is not required to obtain these

instruments. !!®

Third, Karkey denies!” that a security would place it in a better position than it would have
otherwise been; nor would it penalize Pakistan for applying for annulment. Again, Karkey

agrees with the committee in Sempra v. Argentina, which stated that

the appropriate comparison is not with a scenario where the award
debtor would not comply with its obligation under Article 53 (where
a guarantee would obviously be ‘better’), but with one where the
debtor would comply. In such case the guarantee would not place
the award creditor in a better situation. !!®

THE AD HOC COMMITTEE’S CONSIDERATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

A. The Relevant Legal Provisions

In this section, the Committee recalls the relevant provisions of the Convention and

Arbitration Rules.
Article 52(5) of the Convention states:

The Committee may, if it considers that circumstances so require,
stay enforcement of the award pending its decision [on annulment].
If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his
[annulment] application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally
until the Committee rules on such request.''°

Article 53(1) of the Convention provides:

The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to
any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this
Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of
the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been
stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.

Article 54(1) then goes on to state:

Karkey Karadeniz Elektrik Uretim A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan
(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

 

Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant
to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations
imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final
judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal
constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal
courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it
were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.

97. Turning to the Arbitration Rules, Rule 54 provides in relevant part:

(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment
of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time
before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the
enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application
relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the
consideration of such a request.

(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award
contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-
General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both
parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal
or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule
within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it
decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.

[.]

(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3)
shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its
modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after
the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of
presenting its observations.

B. Discretion of the Committee

98. It is clear from the wording “[t]he Committee may” in Article 52(5) of the Convention that
the Committee has discretion to decide whether or not to use its authority to stay

enforcement of the Award.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

As the committee in Kardassopoulos v. Georgia noted, a “[s]tay of enforcement during the
annulment proceeding is by no way automatic, quite to the contrary, a stay is contingent

upon the existence of relevant circumstances which must be proven by the Applicant.”!°

The only “automatic” stay is provided for by Arbitration Rule 54(2) providing that the
Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the
provisional stay of the award. But thereafter, the decision is turned over to the Committee
which shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be
continued. That provision expressly states that, unless the Committee decides to continue

the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.

Cc. Burden of Proof

As summarised in Section IV above, the Parties’ dispute who bears the burden of proof
regarding the stay of enforcement. In this context, the Committee notes that in the
Application for Annulment, Pakistan stated that it “respectfully requests that the
enforcement of the Award be stayed until the ad hoc Committee decides on this request for

annulment.”'?! Pakistan has maintained and repeated that request in its later submissions.

As Karkey correctly points out, the stay would not have been an issue at all in this
proceeding had Pakistan not requested it, and Karkey is therefore merely reacting to, and

opposing, Pakistan’s proposal to continue the stay. !77

Pakistan still is and has been from the beginning the proponent of the stay, and thus—as
with any legal claim or proposition—ultimately bears the burden of proof according to the

principle onus actori incumbit probatio.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

 

104. This interpretation is supported by the wording of Arbitration Rule 54(4) that a request to
continue a stay pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2) “shall specify the circumstances that

require the stay, or its modification or termination.”!?*

105. The Committee finds that, indeed, numerous ad hoc committees have confirmed that the
party seeking continuation of the stay bears the burden of proof. ad
106. Therefore, the Committee has no doubt that Pakistan has the burden to prove that such

circumstances exist in the present case.

D. Are There “Circumstances that Require” Continuation of the Stay?

107. For its examination whether there are “circumstances that require” the continuation of the

stay, the Committee notes the following:

108. Karkey argues that the legal standard for harm to justify a stay is high and relies on
decisions of ad hoc committees that have asked “whether termination of the stay would
have ... ‘catastrophic’ immediate and irreversible consequences for [the State’s] ability to
conduct its affairs.”'?° The Committee has some doubt that such a high threshold can be
drawn from the wording of Arbitration Rule 54(4). But as the wording in Rule 54(2)
provides that the request for a stay “shall specify the circumstances that require the stay,”
it seems clear that circumstances which are a normal effect of an ICSID Award for a state
are not sufficient. Rather, the circumstances must be specific, and allegations of harm must
be substantiated by “specific evidence and data” that give rise to a “particularized fear” of
harm.!7° In particular, the word “require” in Rule 54(4) makes it clear that the

circumstances must have a considerable weight in order to provide a reason to change the

123 Arbitration Rule 54(2) (emphasis 2
'24 To avoid repetition, reference is made to that cases mentioned in footnote 65 above. As shown by Karkey, the cases
relied on by Pakistan indeed do not support the contrary. See Karkey’s First Submission, { 20.

normal result of an ICSID award, which is that the State “shall recognize” the award as

binding “and enforce the pecuniary obligations” of the award.

Pakistan has argued that there is no risk that it will not comply with the Award if it is not
annulled. Both Parties have discussed this issue. However, the Committee does not
consider it to be significant, because, as seen above, Pakistan has the burden of proving
that circumstances exist which require a continuation of the stay while Karkey does not
have the burden of proving that Pakistan will not comply with the Award if it is not
annulled. Further details in this regard will be discussed below when the relevance of the

letters of the Attorney-General dated 26 January and 9 February 2018 is examined.

Pakistan alleges that the stay must be lifted in view of the the following circumstances:
(i) Enforcement of the Award would impact its budget.'2”

(ii) There is no guarantee that Pakistan would be able to recoup any amounts
already collected by Karkey if the Annulment Application were to
succeed, !78

(iii) | The Award has severe defects that make its annulment unavoidable. !7°

(iv) | The Attorney-General’s assurances provides sufficient security for
Karkey. '°°

Regarding Circumstance (i) above, i.e. the impact on Pakistan’s budget, Pakistan has
alleged that it would suffer “irreparable harm” because it “would be required to set aside a
significant amount of public funds and allocate those funds to the payment of the Award,”
which would “take away from its annual budget” resulting in “fewer funds” for State-
provided services “such as education, security and housing, among others.”'*! In this

context, Pakistan compares the amount of the Award to its health and education budgets. !*7

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

 

112. The Committee does not consider that these arguments by Pakistan provide specific
evidence that gives rise to a particularized fear of harm, since such effects are inherent and
“normal” to the pecuniary obligations imposed by an adverse ICSID award. While the
Committee agrees that health services and education are important parts of the state budget,
that does not mean that these are to be decreased due to the Award. It is for Pakistan to
decide on its priorities as to which parts of the total state budget should be decreased in
case of payment for the Award. Such budgetary effects alone are not in and of themselves
a sufficient justification for a stay. If a general impact on a State’s budget were sufficient
to require a stay, a stay would become in essence automatic whenever the award debtor is
a State. That result would be contrary to the plain language of Article 52(5) of the
Convention and Arbitration Rule 54, and would destroy their effectiveness. As pointed out
by Karkey, several ad hoc committees have confirmed this, finding that mere allegations

of budgetary impact do not justify a stay.'**

113. Therefore, the budgetary effects alleged by Pakistan are not circumstances sufficient to

require a stay.

114. Regarding Circumstance (ii) above, i.e. that there is no guarantee that Pakistan would be
able to recoup any amounts that had been collected by Karkey if the Annulment

Application were to succeed, the Committee notes the following:

115. The few ad hoc committees that have found a real risk of non-recoupment did so when the
award creditor was an individual, or a shell company with a sole controlling individual,

and where the risk of bankruptcy was shown to be a legitimate concern.'*+ Karkey has

provided evidence that it is a multi-billion-dollar company with assets around the world.!>

Pakistan has not provided any concrete evidence to suggest that Karkey could go bankrupt

before the annulment proceedings conclude.

116. Further, Karkey has offered to maintain any collected sums in an escrow account until a

decision on annulment is reached. !°°

117. In view of the above, the Committee concludes that Pakistan has failed to prove that it runs

the risk of non-recoupment if the stay were lifted.

118. Regarding Pakistan’s Circumstance (iii) above, i.e. that the Award has severe defects that
make its annulment unavoidable, the Committee’s conclusion can be short. The Committee
has no reason to doubt that Pakistan submitted the annulment request in good faith.
However the Committee shares the view expressed in OJEG v. Venezuela, that “the merits
of an annulment application are not relevant for purposes of the decision on whether or not

to grant the stay, or the continuation of the stay.”!*’ This has been confirmed by a number

of other committees that have articulated the same point.'**

119. Regarding Pakistan’s Circumstance (iv) above, i.e. that the Attorney-General’s Statement

provides sufficient security for Karkey, the Committee considers the following:

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

Karkey has claimed in its written submissions that the stay must not be continued because
Pakistan, though assuring that it has and will comply with its obligations under
international law, had avoided assuring that it will comply with its obligations under the
disputed Award in this case, should it not be annulled. '*° In this context, the Committee
notes that, with its Reply submission, Pakistan submitted the Attorney-General’s

Statement, which expressly states:

In case, however, the Award is not annulled, Pakistan hereby
undertakes to recognize the Award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal
as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by
that award.'4°

Pakistan submitted a second letter dated 8 February 2018 in which the Attorney-General

states:

I confirm the assurances provided in my letter and as subsequently
presented by the delegation of Pakistan during the course of hearing
on 5 February 2018. For avoidance of doubt, Pakistan shall abide by
and comply with the Award in conformity with Article 53 of the
ICSID Convention, if it is not annulled. '*!

The Committee is satisfied by these letters and does not share Karkey’s view that the stay
must be terminated because of Pakistan’s failure to commit to complying with the Award.
The Committee is further aware of the relevance given by committees in early annulment

cases to similar comfort letters, particularly in cases involving Argentina. !4?

However, the
Committee also notes that the above assurance in the first letter repeats wording found in
the first sentence of Article 54(1) of the Convention, and the second letter confirms
Pakistan’s obligations under Art. 53 of the Convention. Though Pakistan refers to these

letters as unilateral declarations creating legal obligations under international law,'*

they
do not go beyond the obligations already stated in the Convention for an ICSID Contracting

State towards an award rendered pursuant to the Convention. Therefore, the obligations

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

confirmed in the letters already exist for Pakistan under the Convention itself, and the

Attorney-General’s assurances add no further security.

Further, if such assurances were to be considered a “circumstance” requiring a stay of
enforcement, it would be rather easy for a State to achieve a stay simply by a letter of this
kind re-confirming an obligation which it already has under the Convention. In fact, that
would create the possibility for States to create an automatic stay of enforcement. Such a
result would be contrary to the text and obvious intention of Arbitration Rule 54(4), which

refers to “circumstances that require the stay.”
However, the Committee notes that the second letter by the Attorney-General also states:

The Government of Pakistan shall be pleased to provide any further
assurances to the Annulment Committee ... that it may require to be
fully assured of Pakistan's commitment to complying with the
Award, if it is not annulled. In this regard, I kindly request the
Committee’s guidance on the terms of any letter that would, in its
view, provide it with the comfort necessary to continue the stay
based exclusively on this sovereign assurance.

The Committee is ready to make use of this offer, and therefore has included it below as a
possible option on which the Parties may agree as a condition for a continuation of the stay
of enforcement. But, as concluded above, it is insufficient for Pakistan to unilaterally
provide an assurance. Accordingly, such an assurance will be accepted as a condition only

if Karkey finds it sufficient and agrees.

In view of the above considerations, the Committee reaches the following conclusion
regarding Arbitration Rule 54(4): Taking into account the above considerations, the
Committee concludes that Pakistan has not provided sufficient proof that circumstances
exist in the present case which require a continuation of the stay, as mandated by Rule

54(4).

E. Conditions for Continuation of the Stay

127. Karkey has requested, in the alternative, that the Committee require Pakistan to provide a
reasonable security if the stay is continued. '* In response, Pakistan argues that neither the
Convention nor the Arbitration Rules provides for a committee, in granting the stay of
enforcement of an award, or the continuation thereof, to make such stay conditional on the

provision of a security. !45

128. The Committee does not share Pakistan’s view. The Committee recalls the wording of
Article 52(5) of the Convention: “The Committee may, if it considers that circumstances
so require, stay enforcement of the award ...” As has been seen above, the word “may”
makes it clear that this provision grants discretion to the Committee to either grant a stay
or refuse it. In the view of the Committee, it is clear that between these opposing
alternatives, this discretion logically includes medium solutions as a compromise, such as

granting a conditional stay.

129. This reasoning has been accepted by a number of other ad hoc committees. '“° In fact, the
statistics provided by ICSID in its Background Paper on Annulment show that, of the 36
decisions granting a stay, 22 conditioned the stay upon the issuance of some type of security

or written undertaking. '47

130. In this context, Pakistan has argued that “it is not uncommon for ICSID tribunals or
committees to actually reach the point of maturity of a very critical legal theory years and
even decades after first being tackled with the issue.”'** In principle, the Committee agrees.

But, for the reasons mentioned above concerning the wording of Article 52 and the

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

discretion granted by the word “may”, the Committee does not see any reason why this

established practice of ad hoc committees should be reversed at this time.

Therefore, though the Committee has concluded above that Pakistan has not provided proof
of circumstances requiring a stay, the Committee considers that it can use its discretion to
continue the stay subject to conditions which the Parties might find feasible and a
preferable solution. On the one hand, such a condition would provide Karkey security in
the case that the Award is upheld. On the other hand, it would ensure that Pakistan would
not be exposed to enforcement attempts during this proceeding and could recoup any

amounts if the Award is annulled.

The Committee identifies the following options for a condition under which the stay could

be continued:
a. The first option suggested by Karkey: a bank guarantee or standby letter of credit. !4?

b. The second option suggested by Karkey: an appropriately capitalized escrow account
established by Pakistan pledged in favour of Karkey to satisfy the Award. The sums
paid into the escrow account may be collected by Karkey in full if the Annulment
Application is rejected; in the event of partial annulment, the funds may be collected

partially by Karkey in the remaining amount of the Award rendered in its favor.'*°

c. The option suggested by Pakistan: A written undertaking by Pakistan providing
sufficient assurance that Pakistan will comply with the Award if or in so far as it is not

annulled. !°!

d. Beyond these three options proposed by the Parties, the Committee would be ready to
consider any other condition which the Parties may be able to find and agree on in their

discussion after taking note of the present Decision of the Committee.

(ICSID Case No. ARB/13/1) Annulment Proceeding

The Parties are invited to liaise as soon as possible to discuss whether any of the above
options can be agreed. In such a case, the Parties are invited to include in their agreement
any further details they consider necessary, for example that Karkey should agree to bear
the costs of any bank guarantee, stand-by letter of credit, escrow account or other

arrangement should the Award ultimately be annulled.

To give the Parties time for such discussions, the Committee considers it should continue

the stay for two months from the date of this Decision.

Tf, by that time, the Parties have not informed the Committee of an agreement, the stay of
enforcement shall be terminated.

DECISION

For the reasons above, the ad hoc Committee holds as follows:

a. The stay of enforcement shall continue for a period of two months from the date

of this Decision.

b. If, by the expiration of the period of two-months from the date of this Decision,
the Parties have not informed the Committee that they have reached an agreement
regarding the conditions for continuation of the stay of enforcement, the stay shall

be terminated.
