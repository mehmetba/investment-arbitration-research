PROCEDURAL HISTORY

COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION

On 5 February 2008, the Investors served upon the Government of Canada a Notice of Intent to
submit a Claim to Arbitration (“Notice of Intent”) in accordance with Articles 1116 and 1119 of
the North America Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), alleging violations by the Respondent of
its obligations under Section A of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

On 26 May 2008, the Investors filed a Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 3 of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules of 1976 (“UNCITRAL
Rules”) and NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1120. On 5 August 2008, the Parties agreed that the
effective filing date of the Notice of Arbitration was 17 June 2008.

The Investors appointed Professor Bryan P. Schwartz as the first arbitrator. The Respondent
appointed Professor Donald McRae as the second arbitrator. Following an invitation from the
Parties, Judge Bruno Simma accepted to act as President of the Tribunal on 29 January 2009. The
Parties confirmed the proper constitution of the Tribunal at the first procedural meeting, as

recorded in Procedural Order No. | of 9 April 2009.

On 30 January 2009, the Investors filed their Statement of Claim.

On 9 April 2009, following a first procedural meeting with the Parties, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 1, in which it fixed Toronto, Ontario, Canada as the place of arbitration and
provided that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) would administer the arbitral

proceedings, and provide registry services and administrative support.

On 4 May 2009, the Respondent filed its Statement of Defense.

On the same day, following a joint proposal by the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 2 providing guidance on the appropriate classification of confidential information. The Order
also provided that any hearings would be open to the public except when necessary to protect

confidential information.

On 11 May 2009, the Respondent applied for bifurcation of the proceedings between a liability
phase and a damages phase. The Investors objected on 14 May 2009. On 3 June 2009, the Tribunal
issued Procedural Order No. 3 ordering the bifurcation of the proceedings between

jurisdiction/liability, on the one hand, and quantum, on the other hand. In the same Procedural

PCA 224177 2

Award on Damages

Order, the Tribunal established principles for the taking of evidence in the present arbitration,

including by making provisions for document production.

AWARD ON JURISDICTION AND LIABILITY
On 25 July 2011, the Investors submitted their Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability.”

On 9 December 2011, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and

Liability.?

On 21 December 2012, the Investors submitted their Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction and
Liability.*

On 21 March 2013, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Liability.>

The Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits was held in Toronto from 22 October to 25 October 2013,
and from 28 October to 31 October 2013. The Hearing was live-streamed on the website of the

PCA, and the recordings remain available on the PCA’s Case Repository.°

On 17 March 2015, the Tribunal rendered an Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the dispositive

part of which provides:

742. In light of the foregoing, and having considered carefully the Parties’
arguments and the evidence before it, the Tribunal,

a) In respect of Mr. William Richard Clayton, Mr. Douglas Clayton, Mr.
Daniel Clayton and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc.,
i. Unanimously decides that the Tribunal has jurisdiction insofar as
these Investors base their claims on events occurring on or after
17 June 2005; the Respondent's jurisdictional objection is upheld
insofar as the Investors base their claims on events occurring
prior to that date;

ii. By majority vote decides that the Respondent has failed to accord
to investments of these Investors treatment in accordance with
international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security, in breach of Article 1105 (Minimum
Standard of Treatment);

iii. | By majority vote decides that the Respondent has failed to accord
to investments of these Investors treatment no less favorable than
that it has accorded, in like circumstances, to investments of its
own investors, in breach of Article 1102 (National Treatment);

b) In respect of Mr. William Ralph Clayton, unanimously reserves its
position as to whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton qualifies as an
“investor” for purposes of NAFTA; accordingly, the Tribunal makes no
decision in respect of the merits of the case in relation to him;

c) Unanimously defers any decision on the quantum of compensation
owed to the Investors as well as any decision on costs to a later stage of
these proceedings.
Professor McRae disagreed with some of the Tribunal’s findings and conclusions, and appended

a dissenting opinion to the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability.

DETERMINATION OF THE PROCEDURAL TIMETABLE ON DAMAGES

On 29 May 2015, the Investors requested that a hearing be scheduled to establish the procedural

calendar for the damages or quantum phase.

On 16 June 2015, the Respondent filed an application to set aside the Award on Jurisdiction and
Liability (“Set-Aside Application”) in the Federal Court of Canada. On 17 June 2015, the
Respondent requested that the Tribunal stay the proceedings pending a decision of the Federal

Court of Canada on the Set-Aside Application.

Having considered two rounds of submissions by the Parties regarding the Respondent’s
application for a stay, on 10 August 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19 denying

the application.

On the same day, the Tribunal advised that the Parties confer and provide their views on a possible
pleading schedule for the quantum phase, the need for document production, and the likely

duration of a hearing.

On 4 September 2015, in a joint letter, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed on
a provisional pleading schedule, and considered that the required duration of the hearing would

be between five and ten days.

On 15 September 2015, the Respondent submitted a motion requesting the Tribunal to consider
the principles relevant to the quantification of damages and the scope of issues to be addressed in
the damages phase as preliminary matters. The Tribunal’s treatment of this subject as a

preliminary matter, the Respondent contended, would serve to enhance the efficiency of the

damages phase. The Investors requested that the Tribunal deny the motion, arguing that, should

the motion be granted, they would be deprived of a full opportunity to present their case.

On 5 January 2016, having considered the Parties’ views, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 20 ruling that the Arbitration shall proceed with a single, undivided quantum phase.
Consequently, the Tribunal set out a procedural timetable, which was based on the Parties’ agreed

schedule contained in their joint letter dated 4 September 2015.

On 26 January 2016, for the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal recalled the due dates for the
document production phase at the quantum stage of the arbitration as they stood after the
modifications of the procedural calendar in Procedural Order No. 20. According to the Tribunal’s
letter, the Parties were to exchange (i) document requests by 10 February 2016, (ii) objections to
any document requests by 25 February 2016, (iii) responses to such objections by 11 March 2016,
and (iv) replies to such responses by 21 March 2016.

On 16 March 2016, the Respondent requested an extension for the filing of replies to 29 March
2016, to which the Investors consented. On the same day, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s

request.

On 29 March 2016, having considered the Parties’ view that further time was required to discuss
outstanding objections, the Tribunal granted the Parties’ request for a further extension to 11 April

2016.

Following the Parties’ correspondence regarding the steps to follow in the document production
phase, on 28 April 2016, the Tribunal requested that the Investors submit by 11 May 2016
additional comments on the Respondent’s objections provided in the Redfern Schedule dated 11
April 2016. On 3 May 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Respondent was allowed

to revise its replies taking into account the Investors’ comments by 18 May 2016.

On 6 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 21, in which it decided on the Investors’

requests for the production of documents to which the Respondent maintained its objections.

On 4 July 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and comment on the expected duration

and the dates of the hearing.

On 18 July 2016, the Parties submitted their responses to the Tribunal’s letter dated 4 July 2016.

The Parties disagreed on the expected duration of the hearing. The Investors proposed that ten

days be reserved for the hearing, whereas the Respondent suggested that five days should be

sufficient.

On 4 August 2016, the Tribunal requested that the Parties hold two time periods in early 2018 in

reserve, during which the hearing could be held.

WRITTEN PLEADINGS ON DAMAGES

On 7 November 2016, the Tribunal approved the Parties’ agreement on the extension of the due
dates for the first round of submissions on quantum. Accordingly, the time for the filing of the

Investors’ Damages Memorial and supporting materials was extended to 16 December 2016.

On 17 December 2016, the Investors’ submitted their Damages Memorial. The Investors informed
the Tribunal, however, that one further expert report would be submitted at a later stage. In

addition, the Investors designated the Damages Memorial as confidential in its entirety.

On 12 January 2017, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal bar the Investors from filing the
delayed expert report. Alternatively, should the Tribunal admit the report, the Respondent
contended that the Tribunal should deem the Investors’ Damages Memorial incomplete and
suspend the subsequent deadline for the submission of the Respondent’s Damages Counter-

Memorial.

On the same day, in a separate letter to the Investors, the Respondent contested the Investors’
designation of the entire Memorial as confidential. The Respondent proposed that the whole
document be deemed public should the Investors fail to provide a redacted version of the Damages
Memorial. In addition, the Respondent asserted that the Investors had failed to provide all of the
sources and evidence upon which their experts and witnesses relied in their reports and statements,

and requested that such missing sources be provided.

On 14 February 2017, having considered the Parties’ comments in relation to the delay in the
Investors’ filing of the expert report, the designation of the Investors’ Damages Memorial as
confidential, and the obligation to produce evidence relied upon in the submission, expert reports,
and witness statements, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 22 resolving these procedural
disputes. As for the first matter, the Tribunal requested that the Investors choose to either treat
their submitted Damages Memorial as complete as it stood or, resubmit their Damages Memorial
with the expert report. Should the Investors pursue the second option, the time period for the
Respondent’s submission of its Damages Counter-Memorial would be adjusted accordingly. As

regards the second matter, the Tribunal ordered that the Investors provide a redacted version of

the Damages Memorial by 6 March 2017. As to the third matter, the Tribunal ordered that the
Investors provide the Respondent and the Tribunal with certain additional sources upon which

their experts and witnesses had relied in their written reports and statements.

On 20 February 2017, the Investors informed the Tribunal that they had decided to resubmit the

Memorial.

On 10 March 2017, the Investors resubmitted the Investors’ Damages Memorial (“Memorial”).

On 26 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 23, in which it addressed the Parties’
disagreement on the Respondent’s request for the production of additional source documents

relied upon by the Investors’ experts and witnesses.

On 9 June 2017, the Respondent submitted the Government of Canada’s Damages Counter-

Memorial (“Counter-Memorial”).

On 14 August 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 24 addressing the Parties’
disagreement on the production of additional source documents relied upon by the Respondent’s

experts and witnesses in their reports and statements.

On 23 August 2017, the Investors submitted the Investors’ Reply Damages Memorial (“Reply”).

On 6 November 2017, the Respondent submitted the Government of Canada’s Damages

Rejoinder Memorial (“Rejoinder”)

On 30 and 31 January 2018, pursuant to Section 7.2 of Procedural Order No. 25 and the Tribunal’s
direction of 17 November 2017, the Parties submitted electronic copies of confidential and public
(redacted) versions of every pleading, witness statement, expert report, and exhibit to the other
disputing Party, the Members of the Tribunal, and the PCA. The PCA subsequently made the

redacted version available to the public on its Case Repository.

SUBMISSIONS OF THE NAFTA NON-DISPUTING PARTIES

On 9 November 2017, following the receipt of the Respondent’s Rejoinder, the Tribunal invited
the NAFTA non-disputing parties to make any submissions pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 by
21 December 2017.

had been granted.

On 21 December 2017, the United States of America requested an extension to file its
observations pursuant to NAFTA Article 1128 on or before 31 December 2017. On 22 December
2017, the Tribunal granted the request.

On 31 December 2017, the United States of America filed its submissions pursuant to NAFTA
Article 1128 (“United States’ Submission’), which notably addressed the application of NAFTA
Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1); questions of causation; and the appropriate valuation date for

compensation of NAFTA breaches.

On 15 January 2018, the Investors submitted their Response to the United States’ Submission.

The Respondent did not avail itself of the opportunity to submit any comments.

CONFIDENTIALITY DESIGNATIONS TO THE PARTIES’ WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS

On 31 October 2017, the Respondent submitted its objections to the Investors’ confidentiality
designations of their Memorial, Reply, expert reports and witness statements, and proposed a
schedule according to which the Parties’ disputes on confidentiality designations would be

resolved.

On 6 November 2017, the Investors replied to the Respondent's letter of dated 31 October 2017,

requesting the Tribunal to reject the Respondent’s proposed schedule.

On 17 November 2017, the Tribunal established a schedule for the Parties to file objections to the

confidentiality designations submitted by the other Party.

On | December 2017, the Investors submitted their reply to the Respondent’s objections to the
Investors’ confidentiality designations of their Memorial, Reply, expert reports and witness

statements.

On 8 December 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 26, in which it identified the
confidentiality designations of the Investors that it considered justified, and ordered that the
Investors submit revised redacted versions of materials that were subject to blanket confidentiality

designations.

On 13 December 2017, the Investors submitted revised redacted versions of all the materials that

had been subject to blanket confidentiality designations.

On 15 December 2017, the Respondent submitted its proposed confidentiality designations to its

Counter-Memorial, Rejoinder, expert reports, witness statements, and exhibits.

On 5 January 2018, the Investors submitted their objections to the Respondent’s confidentiality

designations.

On 19 January 2018, the Respondent filed its response to the Investors’ objections to the

Respondent's confidentiality designations.

On 26 January 2018, the Tribunal issued its decision on the confidentiality designations to the

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, Rejoinder, expert reports, witness statements and exhibits.

ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE HEARING ON DAMAGES

On 24 August 2017, following the filing of the Investors’ Reply, the Tribunal invited the Parties
to confer and advise the Tribunal on their preferred time period for the hearing, the number of

hearing days that was required, and the location and venue of the hearing.

On 8 September 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal about points on which they agreed and

points on which disagreement remained.

On 3 October 2017, in preparation for the hearing on damages, the Tribunal invited the Parties to
confer and provide their views on a draft Procedural Order No. 25, addressing logistical and

procedural aspects of the hearing.

On 20 October 2017, the Investors submitted a revised draft of Procedural Order No. 25 agreed
by both sides, and in a separate letter the Respondent identified three points on which the Parties
continued to hold different views, namely the amount of time to be reserved for rebuttal statements
during the closing statements, the treatment of the Parties’ presentation of new documents and
the procedure for addressing potential disputes between the Parties concerning confidentiality

during the hearing.

On 17 November 2017, having considered the Parties’ further comments, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 25 addressing procedural aspects of the hearing, including those on which

the Parties had been unable to reach agreement.

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

On | December 2017, pursuant to Procedural Order No. 25, the Parties sent the Tribunal a list of

witnesses and experts they wished to cross-examine at the damages hearing.

On 17 January 2018, the Investors submitted a new Expert Report of Prof. Lorne Sossin (“New
Sossin Report”) and a new Expert Report of Mr. David Estrin (“New Estrin Report”, and together
with the New Sossin Report, “New Expert Reports”), which, according to the Investors,
responded to the Expert Report of the Hon. Thomas Cromwell (“Cromwell Report”) and the
Witness Statement of Mr. Mark McLean (“McLean Statement”),’ both submitted with the

Respondent’s Rejoinder.

On 18 January 2018, the Respondent objected to the filing of the documents, as it was contrary
to the procedure established in Procedural Order No. 20. The Respondent requested that the
Tribunal reject the purported filing or, in the alternative, allow the Respondent the same amount
of time in order to respond to the submissions, which would result in a postponement of the

hearing.

On the same day, the Tribunal invited the Investors to provide any comments on the Respondent’s
objection and stated that, while this issue was not resolved, the New Expert Reports would not

form part of the record and the Tribunal would refrain from reading them.

On 22 January 2018, the Investors made available for download a number of additional authorities
and fact exhibits that they wished to include in the evidentiary record. On the same day, the
Respondent objected to the filing, noting that several of those documents appeared to be annexes
to the disputed New Expert Reports and reiterating its arguments in opposition to the admission
of any new evidence shortly before the hearing. The Respondent requested the Tribunal not to
open, review, or give any consideration to the documents until the question of their admissibility

had been resolved.

On 24 January 2018, the Respondent submitted its response to the question of admissibility of the
Investors’ New Expert Reports and the additional documentary evidence. The Respondent
objected to the admission of any new evidence on the basis that it would contravene the procedural
rules established by the Tribunal and the due process rights of the Respondent. Therefore, the

Respondent requested that the Tribunal deny the admission of such new evidence. If the Tribunal

were to decide to admit it, the Respondent requested at least 60 days to submit further evidence

in response to the New Expert Reports.

On 25 January 2015, the Investors replied to the Respondent's letter, arguing that, as a matter of
procedural fairness, the Tribunal should consider all the relevant evidence. The Investors
suggested that the Respondent’s experts should be in a position to respond to the Investors’ New

Expert Reports within 21 days, such that the hearing dates could be maintained.

On 26 January 2018, the Tribunal denied the Investors’ request for leave to file New Expert
Reports, additional facts exhibits and additional authorities. Accordingly, those documents would
not form part of the record. The Tribunal noted that it remained open to the Investors to critique
the Cromwell Report and the McLean Statement at the forthcoming hearing in their opening and
closing statements, and probe the strength of the McLean Statement during cross-examination.
The Tribunal also decided that it remained open to the Investors to submit, by 29 January 2018,
an application to the Tribunal to exclude specific statements in the Cromwell Report and the

McLean Statement on the basis that they are unresponsive to the Investors’ Reply Memorial.

Also on 26 January 2018, pursuant to Section 9.1 of Procedural Order No. 25, the Tribunal
identified several issues and questions to which the Parties should give consideration during the
hearing. Specifically, the Tribunal invited the Parties to consider the following points (footnotes

omitted):
Jurisdiction

1. The Tribunal recalls its decision in the 2015 Award to “reserve[] its position as to
whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton qualifies as an ‘investor’ for purposes of
NAFTA; accordingly, the Tribunal makes no decision in respect of the merits of the
case in relation to him”. Noting that no specific submissions have been made since
the 2015 Award as to Mr. William Ralph Clayton’s status as an investor, the Investors
are invited briefly to confirm whether Mr. William Ralph Clayton continues to
pursue any claim in the present arbitration.

NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117

2. Could Canada clarify the nature of its objection that the Investors’ claim is
“impermissible” (Counter-Memorial, para. 29) pursuant to NAFTA Articles 1116
and 1117? Does Canada consider that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claim
as brought; does Canada consider the claim inadmissible; or does Canada regard
NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117 as imposing substantive limitations as to the types
of losses that the Investors can claim (and the Tribunal can award)?

PCA 224177 11

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

3. In light of the Parties’ answers to Question No. 2, what is the relevance of
pleadings or awards in previous NAFTA Chapter Eleven proceedings for the current
proceeding, in which the Tribunal is to determine the amount of compensation due
to the Investors following a finding of liability?

4. Could the Parties please comment on the argument that “barring the Investors’
Article 1116 claim at this late stage, ten years later, would be grossly unfair to the
Investors. Canada has raised this argument for the first time in its Counter-Memorial
on Damages. Having failed to raise it in any way in the Jurisdiction and Liability
phase of these proceedings, let alone at the outset, Canada ought now to be estopped
from even raising the argument.” Similarly, could the Parties please elaborate on the
merits of the argument that the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117 is, at least
in cases where the investment is wholly owned and controlled by the investors, a
“formality”.

5. In light of the foregoing questions, do the Parties have any further comment on
the appropriateness of permitting the Investors to amend their claim to ensure that
the NAFTA Articles 1116/1117 issue is moot?

Causation

6. Considering the role of a NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunal, including vis-a-vis
domestic courts, what is the appropriate approach of this Tribunal in assessing the
likelihood that (i) an expert panel would have recommended approval of the Whites
Point quarry and (ii) Ministers of the Canadian Government would have approved
the project, in the event that the Respondent had acted in compliance with its legal
obligations under NAFTA?

7. What is the consequence under NAFTA and/or general international law of factual
uncertainty as to whether the damage would have occurred in the absence of a breach
of international law? The Parties are invited to consider, in this regard, the holding
of the Permanent Court of International Justice (“PCI”) in the Factory at Chorzéw
case, referred to by the Parties:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act is that
reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act
and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act
had not been committed.

and the holding of the International Court of Justice (“ICJ”) in the Genocide case,
referred to by the United States:

The question is whether there is a sufficiently direct and certain causal nexus
between the wrongful act... and the injury suffered... Such a nexus could be
considered established only if the Court were able to conclude from the case as a
whole and with a sufficient degree of certainty that the [injury] would in fact have

been averted if the R dent had acted in it with its legal obli

PCA 224177 12

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

8. Assuming a different (hypothetical) JRP process for the Whites Point project that
was conducted on a basis which was compliant with NAFTA, what is the degree of
certainty that such a JRP would have recommended the approval of the project? What
hypothetical JRP recommendations, or government licensing conditions, should the
Tribunal assume with respect to the mitigation of potential adverse effects of the
project on the environment? Does this analysis lead to a conclusion that is different
from the Investors’ approach of focusing on the existing JRP Report with a deemed
deletion of findings on community core values?

Mitigation

9. As a matter of international law, can the duty to mitigate damage extend to the
pursuit of judicial review and renewed administrative proceedings in a situation
where conduct in the same type of administrative proceedings has given rise to the
breach of international law? How does the duty of reparation by “re-establish[ing]
the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if [the unlawful] act had
not been committed” relate to such a duty of mitigation?

10. Assuming that a duty of mitigation through judicial review and administrative
proceedings exists, what is the specific evidence on the record of bias on the part of
the “political, administrative and bureaucratic environment within which the Whites
Point Quarry was considered”, which would render mitigation measures futile?

Valuation

11. In the event that the Tribunal were to conclude that the injury caused by the
Respondent’s NAFTA breaches is the loss of an opportunity, how should the value
of such an opportunity be determined? What case law under public international law,
if any, should guide the Tribunal in determining such value? What evidentiary
standards should apply?

12. The Tribunal notes that the Investors submit their valuation of damages
exclusively on the assumption that the Tribunal will award lost profits, without
presenting any calculations in the alternative. Should the Tribunal rule that lost
profits are not recoverable in this case, what is the approach to be taken by the
Tribunal? To what extent do the Investors disagree with the Respondent’s valuation
of mitigation costs, process costs, or investment costs set out in its written
submissions?

13. In the event that the Tribunal were to assume hypothetical JRP recommendations,
or government licensing conditions, with respect to mitigating potential adverse
effects of the project (see Question 8), how would such recommendations/conditions
impact the costs, viability or profitability of the project?

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, the hearing was open to the public. A viewing room,
separate from the hearing room, to which the oral proceedings were live-streamed, was set up for

the public.

Following the examination of the Parties’ witnesses and experts, pursuant to Section 9.2 of
Procedural Order No. 25, the Tribunal indicated to the Parties that it did not see the need to identify
any further issues and questions that the Parties should consider addressing in their closing
statements, in addition to the issues and questions already put to the Parties in writing on

26 January 2018.

On 28 February 2018, the Investors informed the Tribunal that “[w]ith regard to William Ralph

Clayton, he withdraws his claim and does not continue to pursue any claim in the arbitration.”*

At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties agreed on modalities for implementing
corrections to the transcript of the hearing and corrections to the scope of the portions of the
transcript which one or both Parties had designated as confidential. On 1 May 2018, the Tribunal

granted the Parties’ request for an extension of the deadlines for such corrections to 11 May 2018.

On 11 May 2018, the Parties provided their list of corrections to the hearing transcripts, the
majority of which were agreed upon. On 15 May 2018, the Tribunal confirmed the corrections
agreed between the Parties and issued a decision in respect of one proposed amendment to the

transcript that remained disputed between the Parties.

On 4 June 2018, the court reporter provided a corrected version of the transcript on the basis of

the corrections agreed between the Parties and ordered by the Tribunal.

Following further exchanges between the Parties, the Tribunal, and the PCA, on 22 June 2018,
the Parties provided the Tribunal with a final version of the transcript containing annotations to

their opening and closing statements.

On 28 June 2018, the Parties provided the PCA with a public (i.e. redacted) version of the hearing
transcript. The public version of the hearing transcript has been published on the PCA’s Case

Repository.

IV. REPARATION FOR THE INJURY CAUSED BY THE INTERNATIONALLY
WRONGFUL ACT

93. In the present Award, the Tribunal considers the content of the Respondent’s obligation to make
full reparation for the injury caused by its internationally wrongful acts, i.e. the Respondent’s

breaches of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1102.

94. The Tribunal shall briefly address the legal standard of reparation under international law,
including the applicable test for causation. The Tribunal shall then recall the breaches of NAFTA
Articles 1105 and 1102 that it had determined in its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability. On that
basis, the Tribunal shall examine which injury, if any, of the Investors was caused by the
Respondent’s breaches of NAFTA. It falls to the Tribunal to determine which situation would
have prevailed in the absence of the NAFTA breaches found in the Award on Jurisdiction and
Liability—in other words, the applicable “but for” scenario. The Tribunal recalls that pursuant to
NAFTA Article 1116, an investor is entitled to recover only damage incurred “by reason of, or

arising out of” a breach.

A. LEGAL STANDARD OF REPARATION
1. The Investors’ Position

95. The Investors submit that the principle that “the state must make ‘full reparation’ to compensate
for the loss caused by its conduct”, set out by the PCIJ’s judgment in the Case Concerning the
Factory at Chorz6w, is applicable in determining the compensation that is due for the
Respondent’s violation of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1102. The relevant part of the PCIJ’s

judgment reads:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act is that
reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act
and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act
had not been committed. Restitution in kind or, if this is not possible, payment of a
sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if
need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in
kind or payment in place of it-such are the principles which should serve to

Poland), 1928 P.C.LJ. (ser. A) No. 17 (13 September 1928) (“Chorz6w”) (Ex. CA-327); S.D. Myers, Inc v.

determine the amount of compensation for an act contrary to international law.'°
(Investors’ emphasis)
96. This principle of reparation set out in Chorzéw was later codified as Article 31 of the International
Law Commission’s (“ILC”) Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts
(“ILC Articles”), '° and adopted by several NAFTA arbitration tribunals. ’”

97. The Investors recognize that reparation is due only insofar as causation is proven. There must be
a sufficient link between the treaty violation and the damage suffered, and the damage must not
be considered too indirect or remote from the violation.'* More specifically, the Investors refer to
the ruling of the tribunal in the Lemire v. Ukraine arbitration to the effect that “[p]roof of causation
requires that (A) cause, (B) effect, and (C) a logical link between the two be established.”!? On
this basis, the Investors acknowledge that the burden is on them to establish, on the balance of
probabilities, this causal link.”

98. In addition, the Investors argue that they are entitled to claim for damages as long as it is proven
that the Respondent’s conduct is “the efficient and proximate cause” of their loss, regardless of
“an intervening chain of events between the breaches and the loss.” Proximity can be established
by proving that the Respondent could have foreseen that its violations of NAFTA would result in

the damage to the Investors.”!

2. The Respondent’s Position

99. The Respondent recognizes that “under customary international law, Canada has to make full

» 22

reparation for the injury caused by its wrongful acts”.“~ The Respondent emphasizes, however,

that “[t]he principle of causation is an essential element of the obligation to make full

reparation.”?>

100. The Respondent refers to the pronouncement in Chorz6w that “reparation must as far as possible,
wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed” as a general rule of international
law.‘ The implication of this test is that the Tribunal is “by necessity engaged in a hypothetical

exercise, not some alleged ordinary course exercise””>

as alleged by the Investors. The
Respondent emphasizes that the obligation to make full reparation applies only for losses caused
by the specific breach or internationally wrongful act of a State*°—in the present case, the breach

of NAFTA as identified by the Tribunal in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability.

101. The Respondent submits that causation is a key element of the Investors’ claim for
compensation.”” According to the Respondent, it is “a principle of customary international law
that the claimant bears the burden of proving both the fact of the injury that it says it suffered as
aresult of a wrongful act, as well as the compensation to which it thinks it’s entitled.”? Pursuant
to Article 1116(1), it is the Investors’ burden to prove that they have incurred loss “by reason of,

or arising out of” the breach, i.e. that there is a “sufficient causal link” or an “adequate connection”

between the breach and the loss as determined by several investment treaty tribunals.” In other

words, the damage must not be too indirect or remote vis-a-vis the breach.”

102. In support of its position, the Respondent also refers to Article 31 of the ILC Articles.*! The ILC
Articles Commentary to Article 31 explains that “the subject matter of reparation is, globally, the
injury resulting from and ascribable to the wrongful act, rather than any and all consequences

flowing from an internationally wrongful act.”*?

The Respondent argues that an approach that is
consistent with the ILC Articles Commentary was adopted in Biwater Gauff v. United Republic
of Tanzania and Nordzucker AG v. Republic of Poland. In particular, the tribunal in Biwater Gauff
noted that “‘causing injury’ must mean more than simply the wrongful act itself [...], otherwise

and the tribunal in Nordzucker dismissed the claimant’ s claim for lost profits as it failed to prove

that its loss was caused by the respondent’s breach.“

Tribunal” considering the difference between the breaches found in Lemire and in this

arbitration. The Lemire tribunal held that the respondent in that case not only deprived the

claimant of “some chance to win” a radio license** but “actually prevented the claimant from
owning a radio license” after it had won a tender.*” In contrast, the present Tribunal ruled that the

Investors merely lost a fair opportunity to have their case considered and assessed.**

104. In addition, the Respondent argues, the Crystallex award does not support the Investors’ case. The
tribunal in Crystallex held that, for Crystallex’s claim for lost profits to be successful, it must
prove that (i) “it had engaged or would have engaged in a profitmaking activity but for the
respondent’s wrongful act, and that such activity would have indeed been profitable” (Emphasis
in original); and (ii) there is “a reasonable basis to assess such loss of profits.”*”

105. In summary, the Respondent submits that “even where it can be established that an identified
breach was a “but for” cause in the chain of causation, recovery of damages sought is not
permitted unless the claimant can prove that “the wrongful conduct was a sufficient, proximate,

adequate, foreseeable, or direct cause of the injury.”“°

(Respondent’s emphasis) Put differently,
“a claimant cannot be compensated ‘for the deprivation of a right that it never possessed.” The
Respondent adds that it is the Investors’ burden to prove this causal link between the damage
claimed by them and the breach of NAFTA obligations held in the Jurisdiction and Liability
Award.” According to the Respondent, the Investors have to prove “not only causality and fact

or factual causation but also what is often referred to as legal or proximate causation.”

3. The United States’ Article 1128 Submission

106. The United States suggests that, as Articles 1116 and 1117 allow the recovery of loss “by reason

of, or arising out of” a breach, the investor is required to demonstrate “proximate causation”

between the loss and the breach.“*

107. Inelaborating on the standard of proximate causation, which is “an applicable rule of international

pod

law” and has been endorsed by several NAFTA investment tribunals,° the United States cites

the ICJ decision in Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro). The ICJ held:

The question is whether there is a sufficiently direct and certain causal nexus
between the wrongful act [...] and the injury suffered [...] Such a nexus could be
considered established only if the Court were able to conclude from the case as a
whole and with a sufficient degree of certainty that the [injury] would in fact have

been averted if the R dent had acted in it with its legal obli

4. The Tribunal’s Analysis

108. There is no substantive disagreement between the Parties as to the applicability, under NAFTA

£

Chapter Eleven and in the present case, of the standard of full reparation set out by the PCIJ in its
1928 judgment in Chorzéw. The same standard has been laid down in Article 31 of the ILC
Articles and adopted by NAFTA tribunals.** Therefore, Article 31 is the starting point of the

Tribunal’s analysis:

Article 31 Reparation

caused by the internationally wrongful act.

involving expropriation. The starting point of their analysis is [...] the Chorzow Factory case and the relevant
provisions of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.”) (Ex. CA-312).

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the
internationally wrongful act of a State.

109. The Parties however focus on different elements of that standard. While the Investors emphasize
the content of the duty of reparation, namely that “reparation must undo the harm caused by the
breach and make the wronged party whole to the extent possible”,”’ the Respondent underlines
the requirement of causation, namely that any liability is limited to injury resulting from the

NAFTA breaches identified by the Tribunal in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability.*°

110. Authorities in public international law require a high standard of factual certainty to prove a causal
link between breach and injury: the alleged injury must “in all probability” have been caused by
the breach (as in Chorz6w), or a conclusion with a “sufficient degree of certainty” is required that,
absent a breach, the injury would have been avoided (as in Genocide). While the facts of the
Genocide case were of course markedly different from those underlying the present arbitration,
there is an important similarity: the ICJ, as the Tribunal in the present case, was confronted with
a situation of factual uncertainty, where in the view of one of the parties, the same injury would

have occurred even in the absence of unlawful conduct.

111. Aneven stricter approach was established in Nordzucker, where the tribunal enquired whether the

State’s conduct “necessarily” led the investor to act in ways that harmed its profitability.

112. The case law also suggests that a distinction must be drawn between two aspects of quantum:
first, whether causation between the unlawful act and the alleged injury has been established; and,
secondly, assuming that such causation has been established, what the precise amount of the loss

suffered is. As the Crystallex tribunal held:

862. [...][[]n this arbitration, the actual issue is [...] a matter of proof of the causal
link and of the quantum of the damage sustained [...].°' (Emphasis added)

113. Similarly, the Lemire tribunal ruled:

Once causation has been established, and it has been proven that the in bonis party
has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of
damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon
which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.*?

114. As a threshold question, the Tribunal must first consider whether a causal link between the

Respondent's breach of international law and any injury of the Investors has been established at
all. In this regard, the test is whether the Tribunal is “able to conclude from the case as a whole
and with a sufficient degree of certainty” that the damage or losses of the Investors “would in fact
have been averted if the Respondent had acted in compliance with its legal obligations” under
NAFTA.” Alternatively, the Tribunal must be convinced that the Investors’ alleged injury would,

“in all probability”, not have occurred if the NAFTA violation had not been committed.

115. Based on the above, the Tribunal’s analysis of causation in the specific circumstances of this case

will proceed in two steps: it will, in a first step, identify the NAFTA violation by the Respondent,
as determined by the Tribunal in its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, before considering, in a

second step, which injury (if any) suffered by the Investors ensued from this violation.

THE NAFTA BREACHES FOUND BY THE TRIBUNAL IN ITS AWARD ON JURISDICTION AND
LIABILITY

116. The Parties emphasize different aspects of the Tribunal’s reasoning and disagree as to the scope

of issues of fact and law that are to be considered res judicata. It is therefore incumbent upon the
Tribunal to clarify the basis of the Respondent’s liability before considering how the Investors

would have stood in the absence of the NAFTA breaches by the Respondent.

e

The Investors’ Position

117. According to the Investors, the Tribunal has already decided that the federal and Nova Scotia

Ministers, relying upon the Joint Review Panel Report (“JRP Report”), disapproved the Whites
Point quarry and marine facility project (“Whites Point Project’) on the basis of “community core
values”, which is beyond the scope of the reviewing mandate of the Joint Review Panel (“JRP”,
and its reviewing process, “JRP Process”) under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act
(“CEAA”) and the Nova Scotia Environment Act (“NSEA”).*° As a result, despite the Tribunal’s
ruling that “the Ministers could have denied approval of the [q]uarry independently from the
9956

JRP’s recommendation,””* the Investors argue that the Respondent is now precluded from raising

in this quantum phase the argument that “the Government decisions to reject the Whites Point

project, not the JRP’s acts that breached NAFTA, were the reason that the Whites Point project

did not proceed”.*”

118. Relying upon the Expert Reply Report of Mr. David Estrin (“Estrin Reply Report”), the Investors
assert that “[t]his Arbitral Tribunal previously found that the only ‘significant adverse
environmental effect’ (SAEE) likely to arise from the [Whites Point Project] identified by the JRP
was community core values — a factor with no legal relevance under applicable legislation,” and
that “the JRP did not make any other findings of [significant adverse environmental effect], even
though they referenced other potential environmental effects.”°* In this respect, Mr. Estrin refers

to part of the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability which states:

The [JRP] Report expressly identifies only one effect of the project as both
significant and adverse, namely “inconsistency with community core values”. With
respect to other impacts of the project, the Panel allowed that “with the effective
application of appropriate mitigation measures, competent project management and
appropriate regulatory oversight, most project effects should not be judged
‘significant’ .*?
119. Accordingly, the Investors submit that, “in the absence of significant adverse environmental
effects that could not be mitigated, there was no lawful basis for the JRP not to recommend
approval of the [q]uarry.” Thus, “but for Canada’s breaches of the NAFTA, the Whites Point

[qluarry would have been approved and permitted.”

120. Further, the Investors argue that the Tribunal’s factual findings and legal conclusions are res
judicata, and as such cannot be reargued."' In this regard, the present case is no different from
other arbitrations in which tribunals have made findings and conclusions in an earlier bifurcated
phase of an arbitration. In respect of such findings and conclusions, the Tribunal is functus

officio,” and the principle of estoppel, which requires that the Parties be precluded from

the Respondent to relitigate matters already decided would result in an abuse of process, as it
would be contrary to the true purpose of bifurcation.® In addition, it could lead to contradictory

reasons and findings, which would consequently undermine the integrity of this arbitration.

that the Investors seek to rely upon Mr. Estrin, an expert in Canadian environmental law, in
support of their argument on the effect of res judicata under international law; Mr. Estrin’s
interpretation of the Tribunal’s Award on Jurisdiction and Liability actually “ha[s] nothing to do”

with his qualification as an independent expert on Canadian environmental assessment law.

122. According to the Respondent’s reading of the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal

made two key findings. First, the Tribunal held that it was the JRP’s approach in concluding the
JRP Report that constituted breaches of NAFTA obligations.”’ In other words, the JRP’s “failure
to conduct the ‘likely significant adverse environmental effects after mitigation’” analysis and,
instead, its resort to the consideration of community core values in excess of its mandate, were
the basis of the Respondents liability.”’ Secondly, the Tribunal held that these violations resulted
in the Investors’ loss of a fair opportunity to have their Project justly assessed in accordance with
domestic law.” The Respondent highlights that, “in finding fault with the JRP, the award made
no determination as to what the outcome of the EA should have been and, again, nor could it

have.”

123. Based on such understanding, the Respondent argues that “what is res judicata between the parties

is that the JRP Report was incomplete and did not contain the information required by Canadian
law.” Accordingly, the Respondent submits that, in the Tribunal’s causation or “but for”
analysis, the Tribunal should consider “(1) whether, in the but-for world, after analyzing ‘the
whole range of potential project effects’, the JRP might have found other likely significant adverse
environmental effects that could not be mitigated, or that might otherwise warrant a
recommendation for rejection; and (2) with the JRP’s mandate having been properly and fully

discharged, how government decision-makers might have decided on the Whites Point Project.””°

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

124. In the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal held that the approach taken by the JRP
breached Articles 1105 and 1102 of the NAFTA. In this second phase of the arbitral proceedings,
the Parties have however characterized the Tribunal’s analysis differently. The Tribunal will
accordingly recall its findings in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, which in the Tribunal’s

view leave no doubt as to the basis of the Respondent's liability.

a. The JRP’s Unprecedented Approach in respect of “Community Core Values”

125. First, the Tribunal concluded that the Whites Point Project was assessed in a manner that involved
“a fundamental departure from the methodology required by Canadian and Nova Scotia law.””°
The reliance on “community core values” was a “distinct, unprecedented and unexpected
approach taken by the JRP”.”’ The Investors were “not treated in a manner consistent with
Canada’s own laws, including the core evaluative standard under the CEAA and the standards of
fair notice required by Canadian public administrative law”.

126. Asa result, the Tribunal concluded that “the Investors and their investment were not afforded a
fair opportunity to have the specifics of that case considered, assessed and decided in accordance
with applicable laws” in the context of the environmental assessment (“EA”).”? “The Tribunal’s
respectful conclusion is that in all the particular and unusual circumstances of this case, the
Investors were denied an expected and just opportunity to have their case considered on its
individual merits.”*”

127. In taking issue with the unprecedented approach of the JRP, the Tribunal however recognized that
socio-economic considerations may in principle be included within the scope of any valid
assessment: “social impacts can be within the scope of a valid assessment. Furthermore, the value
placed by members of a community on distinctive components of an ecosystem can be taken into

account in an assessment under the laws of Canada and Nova Scotia.”*!

b. The JRP’s Failure to Analyze “Likely Significant Effects after Mitigation”

128. The Tribunal also found that, pursuant to section 16 of the CEAA, the JRP was legally obliged

to report on all factors mentioned there, including mitigation measures.*” The Tribunal concluded:

[T]he JRP was, regardless of its “community core values” approach, still required to
conduct a proper “likely significant effects after mitigation” analysis on the rest of
the project effects. By not doing so, the JRP, to the prejudice of the Investors, denied
the ultimate decision makers in government information which they should have
been provided.**

129. The Tribunal reviewed other projects that were similar to the Whites Point Project in some or
several aspects and were subject to an EA by a JRP. The JRP reports of all these other projects
complied with the legal standard of the CEAA in identifying likely significant adverse effects and
proposing mitigation measures. Unlike the JRP for the Whites Point Project, all other JRPs
addressed the “likely significant adverse effects after mitigation” of the project under

assessment.

c No Prejudgment by the Tribunal as to Approval or Approvability of Project

130. The Tribunal finally made it clear that it was not conducting, in the present proceedings, “its own
environmental assessment, in substitution for that of the JRP.”* Therefore, it was not for the
Tribunal to decide “what the actual outcome should have been, including what mitigation
measures should have been prescribed if the JRP had carried out the mandate contained in
applicable laws”.*°

131. Similarly, the Tribunal did not prejudge the decision that should have been adopted by the
decision-makers in Nova Scotia and federal Canada on the basis of the JRP Report. The Tribunal
limited itself to the finding that “the decision-makers in Nova Scotia and federal Canada had the
authority and duty to make their own decision about the future of the Bilcon project.”*”

132. The Tribunal concluded that “the Investors and their investment were not afforded a fair

opportunity to have the specifics of that case considered, assessed and decided in accordance with

applicable laws”.** This was again emphasized in the Tribunal’s concluding statement at the very
end of its Award: “The Tribunal’s respectful conclusion is that in all the particular and unusual
circumstances of this case, the Investors were denied an expected and just opportunity to have

their case considered on its individual merits”.*

Cc INJURY PROVEN TO BE CAUSED BY CANADA’S NAFTA BREACHES

133. The Tribunal shall now turn to the situation that would have prevailed “in all probability” or “with
a sufficient degree of certainty” had these breaches of NAFTA not occurred. Based on the
Tribunal’s findings in its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, there is no disagreement between
the Parties that the Investors, as a result of the NAFTA breaches identified by the Tribunal in that
Award, lost a fair opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project
assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner. The Parties disagree, however, as to whether the

Investors have proven any injury beyond that with the required degree of certainty.

134. In this regard, the Tribunal will briefly review the “but for” scenarios discussed by the Parties.
The principal bone of contention between the Parties is the likelihood that, but for the NAFTA
breaches, the Whites Point Project would have obtained all relevant regulatory approvals. The
Investors assert that “but for Canada’s breaches of the NAFTA, the Whites Point [q]uarry would
have been approved and permitted and would have produced and shipped stone.”*° In contrast,
the Respondent argues that there was no certainty that the Whites Point Project would have been
approved but for the breach.”' In other words, it is entirely possible that the same outcome would
have obtained even in the event that an EA had been conducted on a basis that was consistent with

NAFTA.

135. According to the Tribunal, the following stages of project approval can be distinguished:
(i) assessment of the Whites Point Project by a JRP; (ii) assessment of and approval decision with
regard to the Whites Point Project by Ministers at the federal and Nova Scotia levels on the basis
of the report of the JRP; and (iii) subsequent industrial approvals. It is only after completion of

these steps that the Investors’ Whites Point Project could have been built and operated.

1. The Investors’ Position

136. According to the Investors, but for the Respondent’s breaches of NAFTA Articles 1105 and 1102,

the Whites Point Project “would have been approved and permitted and would have produced and

1992

shipped stone.

137. The Investors rely on the Estrin Reply Report to explain that the JRP Report identified the Whites

Point Project’s inconsistency with community core values as the only significant adverse
environmental effect.°? As a result, given the Tribunal’s ruling that the JRP’s consideration of
community core values was beyond the scope of the JRP’s mandate under Canadian law,
according to the Investors, the Tribunal should treat the JRP Report as if no assessment of
community core values had been made. In other words, the Investors suggest, the Tribunal should
assume “that the JRP report satisfied the requirements of CEAA and that additional information
was not required in order to make a decision.” Since the JRP Report “offered no other reason to
reject the project, the JRP would otherwise have logically been compelled to recommend approval
of the Whites Point [qluarry.”*° Contrary to the Respondent’s argument, the Investors contend
that leaving the concept of community core values out of the JRP Report would not have rendered
the Report incomplete, as the JRP itself noted in its Report that “it did have sufficient information

to fulfill its mandate.”°°

138. Against this backdrop, the Investors add that the Whites Point Project complied with all the

relevant requirements of the federal and Nova Scotia EA processes, particularly since “with
ordinary mitigation there would have been no significant adverse environmental impact.”®” To
explain the compliance of the Whites Point Project with relevant Canadian environmental law in
detail, the Investors refer to the Estrin Reply Report, in which Mr. Estrin argues that “[t]his
Arbitration Tribunal previously found that the only ‘significant adverse environmental effect’
(SAEE) likely to arise from the [Whites Point Project] identified by the JRP was community core

values.”°* He thus concludes that “it is irrelevant for the Tribunal in this phase of the proceedings

to now consider possible further reasons as to why the project might cause [significant adverse
environmental effects].”°? Therefore, if community core values had been “excluded as a relevant
criterion, there would have been no reasonable basis to conclude that all EA requirements had not

been satisfied.” '°

139. In comparison to other precedents involving environmental approval in Nova Scotia, the Investors

note that “before the Whites Point [q]uarry, there was no project of any kind assessed by a CEAA
review panel that was not ultimately approved.”'! In this regard, the Investors cite Mr. Estrin’s

testimony during the hearing:

[The mitigation measures of] Whites Point, Black Point, Aguathuna, [...] were
essentially similar. That’s another reason why it can be objectively determined that
there isn’t really anything unique about Whites Point that would stand in the way of
some approvability except politics. The Black Point Quarry is a much larger quarry
than Whites Point, would be much more blasting, much larger, much more shipping,
all of those things. In the result, [the decision-makers] came up with mitigation
measures that were ones that Bilcon itself had anticipated were required ten years
ago because of all the expertise that they had involved. !

140. As for the decision-making at the government level, the Investors explain that the federal Minister

99

of Environment and the Nova Scotia Minister of Environment are responsible of approving the
Whites Point Project, pursuant to the CEAA and the NSEA, respectively. However, neither can
exercise its authority without legal constraints, such as the rule of law.'? That is, any exercise of
discretion must be carried out in accordance with the legislative purpose, which in this case “is to
balance environmental protection and economic development.” '™ Given the absence of any other
significant adverse environmental effects found in the JRP Report, the Investors argue that the

Ministers at the federal and provincial levels would have had no reasonable basis for refusing the

approval of the Whites Point Project.""° On this point, the Investors refer to the Expert Reply

Report of Prof. Sossin (“Sossin Reply Report”), in which Prof. Sossin takes the following view:

[W]here there is no evidence of such significant adverse environmental effects, a
Minister does not retain discretion to nevertheless deny approval to a project. There
is no corresponding phrase in section 37(1)(b) of CEAA that says something along
the following lines: “if a project will not have significant adverse environmental
effects, a refusal can nonetheless be justified in the circumstances...”. If the project
does not give rise to significant adverse environmental effects, in other words, there
is no provision in CEAA that would allow the Responsible Authority (“RA”) (or GIC
[Governor in Council]) to turn it down for reasons of political expediency, policy
preference, economic reasons, or in response to public opposition.'°

141. The Investors refer to Canadian administrative jurisprudence on the rule of law to assert that, for

their exercise of power to be lawful, the public authorities have an obligation to consider all
relevant factors and discard all irrelevant ones.'”’ Accordingly, there was “no lawful basis in the
circumstances on which Ministers could lawfully deny environment approval.”'°* Relying on the
Expert Report of Prof. Sossin and the Sossin Reply Report, the Investors submit that, in the
present case, “there was no basis on which the [M]inisters, acting reasonably, could have lawfully
denied regulatory approval of the Whites Point [qJuarry.”'° As such, the Investors conclude that

the Ministers could only have approved the Whites Point Project.'!°

phase of the present Arbitration and in an earlier undertaking made by the Government of Nova
Scotia during the JRP hearings to the effect that there are no records of projects that did not receive

undertaking states that the Government of Nova Scotia had “no record of any project that had

Part V [Industrial Permits] of the Environment Act.”!!! The relevant stipulations submitted by the

Respondent in this arbitration are:

Request 37: Canada stipulates that it has no examples where a proponent of a project
which received environmental assessment approval from the Government of Canada
(under the version of the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act applicable to the
Whites Point EA), and applied to the Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Transport
Canada, or Natural Resources Canada for any permits, licences or authorizations
required for the operation of the project, was denied those permits, licenses or
authorizations.

Request 38: Canada stipulates that it has no examples where a proponent of a project
which received Nova Scotia environmental assessment approval, and completed
applications for Part V approval and/or other relevant permits, licences or
authorizations required for the operation of the project, was denied that approval or
those permits, licences or authorizations. |"

143. The Investors therefore conclude that, in the ordinary course, after obtaining environmental
approval, Bilcon of Nova Scotia’s applications for all necessary permits to build and operate the
Whites Point Project would have been granted by the Nova Scotia Ministry of the Environment.'"

144. Summarizing their case on causation, the Investors conclude that “[b]ut for Canada’s breach, the
JRP would, in the ordinary course, have recommended approval. The Ministers would, in the
ordinary course, have granted approval. And the industrial permits necessary for operation would,
in the ordinary course, have been issued. The evidence proves beyond the required — far beyond
the required — balance of probabilities a direct causal link between the breach and the [I]nvestors’

loss of the Whites Point project.”!!*

Governments’ decisions, not the JRP’s acts constituting the NAFTA breach, which “were the

reason that the Whites Point project did not proceed.” !'®

146. The Respondent adds that it is not the function of this Tribunal to determine what the
Governments’ decisions should have been but for the breach,''” i.e. whether they should have
issued all necessary approvals and permits so that the Whites Point Project could proceed.''* In
this regard, the Respondent cites the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, in which the Tribunal

stated:

This Tribunal also wishes to be very clear that it has not purported in these reasons
to conduct its own environmental assessment, in substitution for that of the JRP. The
Tribunal at this stage simply holds that the applicant was not treated in a manner
consistent with Canada’s own laws, including the core evaluative standard under the
CEAA and the standards of fair notice required by Canadian public administrative
law. The Tribunal is not here deciding what the actual outcome should have been,
including what mitigation measures should have been prescribed if the JRP had
carried out the mandate contained in applicable laws.'"

147. In the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Respondent notes, the Tribunal clearly determined
that the Investors merely lost the fair opportunity to have their Project considered, assessed and
decided in accordance with applicable laws.'”° In other words, the Investors “never had an
approved and operating project. Nor did they have the right to one, even absent the NAFTA

breach,”'?! given that the Tribunal ruled in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability:

The basis of liability under Chapter Eleven is that, after all the specific
encouragement the Investors and their investment had received from government to
pursue the project, and after all the resources placed in preparing and presenting their
environmental assessment case, the Investors and their investment were not afforded
a fair opportunity to have the specifics of that case considered, assessed and decided
in accordance with applicable laws.'”? (Respondent's emphasis)
148. The Respondent criticizes the Investors for asking the Tribunal to “reverse the majority’s
circumscribed decision in the jurisdiction and liability phase, and to now act as the JRP, the Nova

Scotia government, and the federal government in order to issue the approvals and permits that

would have been necessary for the Whites Point project to proceed.”'> According to the
Respondent, “[t]o award the Claimants lost profits on the basis that the project was permitted and
operating would be simply inconsistent with the findings in the Award and would compensate the

Claimants for the deprivation of a right that they never possessed.”!*4

149. The Respondent affirms that a NAFTA tribunal “is not equipped to assume the role of both the

JRP and government decision-makers.” '° It adds that if domestic courts are not allowed to assess
the possibility of a certain outcome in a flawed regulatory review, there is no reason why a NAFTA.

tribunal should have that power.'7°

150. Having emphasized that it is inappropriate for the Tribunal to speculate about possible

government decisions that would have been taken but for the breaches, !””

the Respondent
subsequently analyzes the Investors proposed “but for” scenario and contends that the following
assumptions on which it is based are flawed: (i) that the JRP would have submitted a report with
findings and recommendations in favour of approving the Whites Point Project; and (ii) that the

government decision-makers would have approved the Whites Point Project.!7*

151. In considering these two assumptions, the Respondent asserts that the Tribunal must follow “the

guidance of authorities” such as the PCIJ’s judgment in Chorz6w (i.e. “in all probability”) and
the ICJ’s judgment in Genocide (i.e. “sufficient degree of certainty”).'”? These authorities thus
establish a test that requires a conclusion with a sufficient degree of certainty; according to the
Respondent it is up to the Investors to show that this certainty exists.'*° In applying these
standards, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal will find “the injury alleged by the [Investors]
far too remote to serve as the basis for Canada’s reparation obligation, and any one of the [steps,

hurdles and events in play here] could also break an alleged chain of factual causation.”'*!

152. Regarding the first assumption (that the JRP would have submitted a report with findings and

recommendations in favour of approving the Whites Point Project), the Respondent states that the
Investors’ expert, Mr. Estrin, “overlooks the requirements of the Nova Scotia EA regime” and
“ignores the evidence in the JRP’s public EA record and the many findings and conclusions in the
JRP Report which provided a reasonable basis for the JRP to have made recommendations that

would not be supportive of project approval.” '*?

153. The Respondent disagrees with Mr. Estrin’s assessment that the Whites Point Project should have

been approved given the lack of input from government officials that the Whites Point Project
would cause significant adverse environmental effects. Government submissions, the Respondent
contends, are only part of the whole information needed to be considered by the JRP.'*
Particularly, the JRP works independently and its resolution does not hinge exclusively upon

information or opinions submitted by the Government. '**

154. Moreover, the Respondent argues that Mr. Estrin’s approach of comparing findings in different

review processes is inappropriate, as each review is context-specific.'*> In any case, should the
JRP be compelled to consider the findings of other projects, the Respondent contends that none
of them would be appropriate comparators “due to the differences in the predicted environmental
effects of each project.” This is particularly so in this case due to the uniqueness of the Whites
Point Project, as “its proposed site was in a highly sensitive area, which included the presence of

an endangered population of North Atlantic right whales and a highly valued lobster fishery.” '*”

155. Instead, the Respondent refers to the Expert Report of Dr. Tony Blouin (“Blouin Report”) and the

in the JRP Report.'** Dr. Blouin focused on the precepts of the NSEA, while Ms. Griffiths focused
on the approach under the CEAA.

156. With regard to the CEAA, the Respondent relies on the testimony of Ms. Griffith for the

proposition that “but for” the NAFTA breach it does not follow that the JRP Report would have
provided findings and results, supportive of the Whites Point Project’s approval. In fact, “the JRP
could have reasonably concluded that the project would have likely resulted in significant adverse
environmental effects on the right whale and the lobster, taking into account proposed

mitigation.”

157. With regard to the NSEA, the Respondent refers to the observation of Dr. Blouin that the JRP

Report had found that the Whites Point Project would have an adverse environmental effect or
likely or potential adverse environmental effect on several valued ecosystem components. These
results could have led to a recommendation not to approve the Whites Point Project. Thus, but for
the NAFTA breach, the Whites Point Project may not have been approved pursuant to the
NSEA.'“°

158. Both experts discuss the effect of the Whites Point Project on endangered marine mammals, such

as the North Atlantic right whale and the American lobster, and on the coastal wetland. 41 On the
basis of this expert evidence, the Respondent contends that “it would be impossible to conclude
with confidence that absent the NAFTA breach, a review panel would find no likely significant

adverse environmental effects from the Whites Point Project.” '“?

159. Regarding the second assumption (that the government decision-makers would have approved

the Whites Point Project), the Respondent contends that provincial and federal decision-makers
have discretionary authority to decide on the approval of the Whites Point Project.'*’ They make

economic conditions,'* and the JRP Report is but one of the sources on which these decision-

makers rely, besides staff assessments and public comments.'*°

160. The Respondent argues that the Sossin Reply Report is flawed on several grounds. First, it is

based on the incorrect premise that, if findings on community core values had been excluded, the
JRP would not have found any other significant adverse environmental effects. Rather, the JRP
Report should be deemed deficient, as the JRP did not properly carry out its mandate, and a new

evaluation must be made. '*°

161. Secondly, relying on the Cromwell Report and Expert Rejoinder Report of the Hon. John M.

Evans (“Evans Rejoinder Report”), both written by former Canadian judges, the Respondent
argues that Prof. Sossin fails to acknowledge the broad discretion the Government has as long as
its decision is based on a reasonable ground in the applicable law.'"” Moreover, the Respondent
concludes from the oral testimony of Mr. Robert G. Connelly that, pursuant to the CEAA, “it was
very clear no department, no minister wanted to give an environmental assessment panel the

authority to make decisions. They wanted these panels to be advisory.” '“*

162. Lastly, absent the JRP’s findings on community core values, the JRP Report would be incomplete,

and “the Ministers would likely seek additional information from the JRP, or ask it to reconvene

and complete its mandate.”'“°

163. On the basis of this expert evidence, the Respondent concludes that there is no “but for” scenario

under which the Government would be legally required to approve the Whites Point Project: in
the event that “references to ‘community core values’ are simply excised from the JRP Report

and that the rest of the report remains unchange as the Investors suggest, the government

environmental effects as mandated by the CEAA.'*! If the JRP were subsequently to conclude
that “certain project effects were likely significant adverse environmental effects,” it would be

reasonable for the Government to reject the approval of the Whites Point Project."

Alternatively,
if the JRP found no likely significant adverse environmental effects, the “JRP report [would not
be] binding on the [Government]”, and the CEAA “imposes no restrictions’ on the
[Government’s] exercise of its discretion.” The Government can thus “reject a panel’s findings

and recommendations.” !**

164. The Respondent, relying upon the Expert Report of Mr. Robert G. Connelly (“Connelly Report”),

argues that, pursuant to CEAA, the Governor in Council (the ultimate decision-maker at the
federal level) “could still have reasonably denied approval to the Whites Point Project” and that
with the conclusions on community core values excised, the JRP Report would lack conclusions
on significant adverse environmental effects and accordingly become deficient.'** In any case,
the Respondent argues the Governor in Council is not legally bound to follow the JRP’s findings,
as the JRP’s role is merely to gather information. Rather, the Governor in Council has to take into
account various policy considerations and can consider additional material not addressed by the
JRP.'* Therefore, it is uncertain that, but for the NAFTA breaches, the Governor in Council would

have approved the Whites Point Project.

165. As regards decision-making at the Nova Scotia level under the NSEA, the Respondent asserts that

the Nova Scotia Minister of the Environment as the ultimate decision-maker “can take into
account a wide range of considerations so long as they are relevant, having regard to the purposes
of the NSEA,”!*° and the JRP Report is only one element in such considerations. '°’ In exercising

this decision-making function, the Respondent notes that the Minister has broad discretion in

evaluating the environmental effects of a project under review.'** Referring to the Expert Report
of Mr. Peter Geddes (“Geddes Report”), the Respondent explains that there is no standard EA
practice. As such, “[g]overnment reviewers, may raise issues, identify means of mitigation, or

suggest that there is inadequate information.”'? “[

T]he minister must look at the entire picture,
which includes the definition of environmental effect, the overall principle of balancing economic
development with environmental sustainability and the positive or adverse effects of a project.
And at the end of the day, the minister is the final decision maker regardless of the
recommendation that’s put before him or her.”'® In addition, should the Minister find a JRP
Report incomplete, the Minister could “direct the JRP to fulfil its mandate.”'°!
166. For these reasons, the Respondent submits that “the degree of certainty that such a [NAFTA-
compliant] process would result in [a JRP’s] positive recommendations and _ positive

99162

[government] decisions is [zero], and therefore the NAFTA breach previously found by the

majority did not cause the loss of profits claimed by the Investors.

167. Given the Investors’ refusal to present other alternative claims, the Respondent thus requests that
the Tribunal award the Investors no damages.'®* This approach, the Respondent argues, was

adopted by the tribunal in Nordzucker.'*

3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

168. Applying the standards articulated by the PCIJ in Chorzéw and the ICJ in Genocide, set out above,
the Tribunal must conclude that the causal link between the NAFTA breach and the injury alleged
by the Investors has not been established. While the Tribunal has no doubt that there is a realistic
possibility that the Whites Point Project would have been approved as a result of a hypothetical
NAFTA-compliant JRP Process, it cannot be said that this outcome would have occurred “in all

probability” or with “a sufficient degree of certainty”.

169. In the Tribunal’s view, various outcomes of a NAFTA-compliant JRP Process are reasonably

conceivable. First, a different, NAFTA-compliant process could have reasonably concluded that
the Whites Point Project would have serious adverse effects on right whale and lobster habitats,
which are not capable of mitigation. In this regard, a JRP could have relied on the assessment of
the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada’s report on the North Atlantic
right whale in Canada, '® and the recovery plans for the North Atlantic right whale recommended
to the Canadian Government.'® While the Tribunal does not consider that such a conclusion was
necessarily the most likely one, given the approval, albeit with conditions, of other Canadian
quarry projects,'°”

this Tribunal.

it would certainly be a possible conclusion on the basis of the record before

170. Secondly, a different, NAFTA-compliant process could have reasonably concluded that, on

balance, serious socio-economic adverse effects, which are not capable of mitigation, persist.
While the Tribunal took issue with the manner in which the JRP relied on community core values,
it did not call into question the relevance of socio-economic effects in the EA process. The record
shows that the Whites Point Project was assessed to have both positive and negative socio-
economic effects. As discussed by the Tribunal in its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the
prospect that the Whites Point Project would create employment opportunities, notably for
younger people who might otherwise have to leave the region as a result of the decline of fishery,
was put to the JRP by members of the local community as an expected positive effect.'®* Other
members of the community suggested negative effects on tourism and the community’s well-
being.’ This Tribunal cannot speculate as to whether the expected negative socio-economic
effects, once properly assessed by a JRP, could have outweighed the expected positive effects and

justified the rejection of the Whites Point Project.

171. Thirdly, a different, NAFTA-compliant JRP Process could have reasonably recommended that the

Such conditions might notably have included provisions for the protection of human health or
animal health (e.g., to reduce noise pollution). It would be pure speculation were this Tribunal to
attempt to predict what conditions regulators might deem appropriate now or over the 50-year
duration of the Whites Point Project, and what their economic effect on it might be. It suffices to
note that it does not seem impossible that such conditions could render the Whites Point Project

economically unviable.

172. Fourthly, even in the event of a positive recommendation by a JRP in a NAFTA-compliant JRP

Process, it is not impossible, though perhaps less likely, that the federal Minister or the Nova
Scotia Minister would subsequently have denied approval or approved the Whites Point Project
with conditions that would render it economically unviable. The factors that were brought to the
federal Cabinet’s attention in 2007, in a federal Cabinet Briefing Document, included
environmental effects, impacts on the tourism and fishing industries, the aesthetics of the
landscape, and the way of life of the local population. '”' It cannot be excluded that some of these
grounds that were ostensibly considered by the Governor-in-Council in its decision to deny
project approval in 2007 would also have been given weight in the event that the JRP Process had
been conducted in a NAFTA-compliant fashion. Similarly, the denial of approval of an expansion
of the Bayside quarry!” supports a finding that environmental approval of quarry projects, at least
in the Inner Bay of Fundy, was uncertain. The Tribunal is not prepared to assume, on the basis of
the evidence before it, that ministerial approval was beyond question once the JRP Process had

led to a positive recommendation.

173. As an alternative argument, the Investors’ EA expert, Mr. Estrin, sought to point out that all other

comparable projects in Nova Scotia were approved.!”* However, while Mr. Estrin’s general point
that Nova Scotia has overall been a welcoming environment for quarry projects stands, the
Tribunal does not believe that it should draw any specific conclusions for the approvability of the

Whites Point Project from this practice.

174. Nor is the Tribunal convinced that the recent approval of a (substantially larger) quarry at Black

Point, Nova Scotia,” is a reliable indicator of the approvability of the Whites Point Project. Black

Point is located on the Atlantic Ocean side of Nova Scotia, while Whites Point is on the Bay of
Fundy. The ecology in both areas is evidently different, as is exemplified, to cite only one element,
by the substantial difference in the number of whale sightings in each area. While the Digby Neck
area of the Bay of Fundy shows a particularly high concentration of whale sightings, very few

such sightings occur on the Atlantic side.'°

175. The Tribunal must accordingly conclude that no further injury has been proven beyond the injury

that is substantially uncontroversial between the Parties on the basis of the majority’s finding in
the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, namely that the Investors were deprived of an opportunity
to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary
manner. In particular, the Investors have not proven that “in all probability” or “with a sufficient
degree of certainty” the Whites Point Project would have obtained all necessary approvals and

would be operating profitably.

176. The Investors are thus only entitled to compensation equivalent to the value of the opportunity to

have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary

manner.

MITIGATION OF LOSS

177. According to the Respondent, the Investors should have mitigated their loss by seeking domestic

judicial review, “which would have expeditiously restored the Claimants’ lost opportunity.”!”°

Accordingly, the Respondent argues that the Investors should only be compensated for the costs
of judicial proceedings in Canadian courts and the costs of a new environmental assessment

process. !77

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

179. The Respondent acknowledges that, should the Tribunal consider that a causal link between the

Investors’ damages claimed and the Respondent’s violations of NAFTA is established, “[the
Tribunal] must start by determining the value of what the Claimants actually lost when they were
denied the opportunity to have the project considered in accordance with Canadian law.”'” In
assessing the compensation that is due to the Investors, however, the Respondent submits that the
Investors’ duty to mitigate their loss must be taken into account. Since “mitigation was reasonably
available to the Claimants and Bilcon of Nova Scotia in the form of judicial review in the

179

Canadian courts,”'” the Respondent argues that the Investors should only be compensated for the

costs of judicial proceedings in the Canadian courts and the costs of a new environmental

assessment process. '*?

180. The Respondent asserts that a duty to mitigate is a general principle of international law applicable

in the present proceedings. The principle is recognized in the ILC Articles Commentary to Article
31, which states that “[e]ven the wholly innocent victim of wrongful conduct is expected to act
reasonably when confronted by the injury” and that “failure to mitigate by the injured party may
preclude recovery to that extent.'*! In the Case Concerning the Gabéikovo-Nagymaros Project,
the ICJ noted Slovakia’s argument that the mitigation of damages was a general principle of

international law, but stated that:

It would follow from such a principle that an injured State which has failed to take
the necessary measures to limit the damage sustained would not be entitled to claim
compensation for that damage which could have been avoided. While this principle
might thus provide a basis for the calculation of damages, it could not, on the other
hand, justify an otherwise wrongful act.'*?

181. Likewise, according to the Respondent, investor-State arbitral tribunals have frequently applied

183,

this rule,"™’ the objective of which is “to avoid the aggrieved party passively sitting back and

waiting to be compensated for harm which it could have avoided or reduced.” '**

182. As regards the relationship between the duty to mitigate loss and the conventional requirement to
exhaust local remedies, the Respondent advises that, while there is no requirement to exhaust
local remedies under NAFTA, the Investors are not exempt from the duty to mitigate.'*° The two
rules are separate and distinct: “While the exhaustion rule relates to jurisdiction, the duty to
mitigate is a damages issue.”!** According to the Respondent, the fact that the Investors had
recourse to Chapter Eleven of NAFTA does not override their duty to mitigate damages.'*” In
support of this position, the Respondent cites the award in Dunkeld International Investment

Limited v. The Government of Belize, which provides:

[R]ecourse to local remedies is not strictly linked to the mitigation of losses, such
that any duty to mitigate should require the exhaustion of local remedies or require
a party to prefer a local remedy to one that may be available to it through
international arbitration. Nevertheless, it may be the case that local administrative
procedures may offer a remedy that appears more rapid or certain than that of an
international claim, such that a party would be derelict in failing to attempt the local

process. '*

183. The Respondent further argues that “judicial review was also an effective remedy that would have
fully restored the claimants’ lost opportunity to have [their] project considered, assessed, and

decided in accordance with applicable laws.”'* Specifically, since the JRP Report was not in

compliance with the legal standards set forth in the CEAA and the NSEA, the courts would “have
remitted the matter back for redetermination in accordance with the Court’s reasons,” and/or
ordered that the JRP be constituted with new members. These measures “would have fully restored
[the Investors’] opportunity to have” their Whites Point Project assessed in accordance with

190

Canadian laws.'”” (Emphasis in original)

184. Regarding the Investors’ argument that judicial review would not provide them with effective

remedies equivalent to the ones available under NAFTA Chapter Eleven, particularly regarding
damages, the Respondent points out that, while Article 1135 only allows tribunals to award
monetary damages, restitution of property, and any applicable interest, judicial review would have
allowed for a redetermination by a new JRP, effectively remedying the NAFTA breach, and
allowing the Whites Point Project to proceed. The Respondent adds that there is no basis for the

Investors to believe that a new JRP would have been unfair, unreasonable or unlawful."°!

185. In addition, the Respondent contends that Article 1121 of NAFTA does not prevent the Investors

from seeking judicial review before Canadian courts. This is because, whereas Article 1121(1)
and 1121(2) order that an investor and its enterprise first waive its right to pursue their claims in
domestic courts of a host State before embarking on NAFTA arbitral proceedings, the provision
does not prevent them from launching “proceedings for injunctive, declaratory or other

extraordinary relief, not involving the payment of damages” in parallel.'°?

186. In response to the Investors’ argument that Canadian courts, if faced with a damages claim, would

not require a claimant to mitigate loss through judicial review, the Respondent argues that
Canadian domestic law is not applicable here since NAFTA Article 1131 expressly provides that
the dispute shall be decided in accordance with NAFTA and the applicable rules of international
law.'9 In any case, even if Canadian law were relevant, the Respondent submits that a recent
Supreme Court of Canada case, Ernst v. Alberta Energy Regulator, supports its assertion that

judicial review is an appropriate mitigation tool.' It also rejects the Investors’ reliance upon

another Supreme Court of Canada case, Attorney General v. TeleZone, by noting that the case did

not involve a ruling on liability or damages. °°

THE INVESTORS’ POSITION

187. The Investors submit that domestic judicial review is not an adequate remedy in the present

circumstances. This is, they argue, because the Investors have been subjected to misconduct by
officials of the Canadian Government for several years, and requiring them to go through
additional years of judicial proceedings and another JRP Process could not guarantee that their
losses would be effectively remedied.'*® In particular, the Investors note that what they had
encountered was not “a mere misapplication of Canadian law that could have been rectified
through judicial review.” Rather, “[t]he political, administrative and bureaucratic environment
within which the Whites Point [q]uarry was considered was biased against the Investors from the

start and throughout.”!°7

188. For this reason, the Investors argue that a possibility that a second JRP Process might be

commenced as a result of judicial review would lead to “a hopeless cycle between a biased
administrative process and a court system ill-equipped to correct it,” as the process is likely to be
conducted in “the same poisoned environment.”'** Relying on the Respondent's expert, the
Hon. John Evans, the Investors argue that even in their likely best outcome, they would have had
to go through lengthy judicial review proceedings, as a result of which their case would have been
referred back to another JRP, without any assurances that the Whites Point Project would
eventually be approved.’ In any event, the Investors assert that, notwithstanding various
obstacles, they had always been actively engaged in alleviating the losses suffered from the

Respondent's conduct by trying their best to navigate through the JRP Process in good faith.?”

189. Consequently, the Investors should not be required to pursue local remedies in this case. As the

only when such means could provide a more rapid and certain remedy than an international

«9
claim.”"'

190. The Investors also argue that the passage in the ICJ’s judgment in Gabcikovo-Nagymaros quoted

by the Respondent did not reflect the ICJ’s own understanding of the duty to mitigate, but merely
paraphrased an argument made by the Slovak Republic. Ultimately, the Investors suggest that the

ICJ did not examine the question of mitigating losses at all.7°

191. Furthermore, the Investors observe that if this were a dispute in a Canadian court, there would not

have been an obligation to mitigate loss by first seeking judicial review before seeking
damages.” To support their case, they cite the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Attorney

General v. TeleZone, which states:

If the claimant is content to let the order stand and instead seeks compensation for
alleged losses (as here), there is no principled reason why it should be forced to
detour to the Federal Court for the extra step of a judicial review application (itself
sometimes a costly undertaking) when that is not the relief it seeks. Access to justice
requires that the claimant be permitted to pursue its chosen remedy directly and, to
the greatest extent possible, without procedural detours.”

192. In any case, there is no guarantee that, had the Investors pursued judicial review, the Canadian

courts would have ordered a sufficient remedy given the broad scope of discretion available to

them on judicial review cases.*°°

193. In addition, the Investors argue that imposing upon them a duty to mitigate their losses through

201

202

203,

204

205

206

judicial review is effectively tantamount to requiring them to exhaust local remedies, an
obligation which does not exist under NAFTA.”"° As such, “{i}f Canada cannot bar a NAFTA
claim [directly] because a prospective claimant has not exhausted local remedies, it should not be

able to eviscerate the NAFTA claim by [indirectly] raising the [argument] at the damages

chose the option to go through the NAFTA proces:
194. Alternatively, should the Tribunal decide that the duty to mitigate applies in this case, the Investors
argue that such duty is nonetheless governed by the standard of reasonableness”” (i.e. “the
Investors only need to take reasonable steps to mitigate”), and it should not be applied in a manner
that unduly favours the wrongdoer.”"” In this regard, the question as to what mitigation measure
is reasonable is a factual matter, and the burden of proof is on the Respondent, having raised the

mitigation defence.

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS
1. Existence of Duty of Mitigation in International Law

195. The Tribunal finds that there are no reasons why the duty to mitigate, as an important aspect of
the law on State responsibility, and as elaborated by various international courts and tribunals,

should not also apply in a NAFTA context.

196. Under international law, a failure by an injured State to take reasonable steps to limit the losses it
incurred as a result of an internationally wrongful act by another State may result in a reduction

of recovery to the extent of the damage that could have been avoided. This principle has been

affirmed by the ILC?” and applied by international tribunals.?"*

mitigate by the injured party may preclude recovery to that extent.”) (Ex. RA-60).

197. The ILC Articles Commentary bases the duty to mitigate in public international law on the ICJ’s

judgment in Gabcikovo-Nagymaros and the UNCC decision on the Well Blowout Control
Claim.?"* On one view, and as the Investors in this case maintain,?'> the ICJ in the Gabéikovo-
Nagymaros judgment at paragraph 80 merely summarized Slovakia’s argument that when
Slovakia carried out Variant C, it was mitigating damages and that this duty amounted to a general
principle of law.?!° In paragraph 81, the ICJ went on to hold that there was no need for it to further
examine such duty, given that Slovakia’s operationalization of Variant C amounted to an
internationally wrongful act. Thus, arguably, the ICJ made no conclusive finding on the duty to

mitigate. 7!”

198. On another view, however, the ICJ in Gabcikovo-Nagymaros implicitly endorsed a duty to

mitigate when it stated that “while [the mitigation] principle might thus provide a basis for the
calculation of damages, it could not, on the other hand, justify an otherwise wrongful act.”?!*

this dispute.”?> The Hrvatska v. Slovenia tribunal also affirmed a duty to mitigate, stating that
“general principles of international law applicable in this case require an innocent party to act
reasonably in attempting to mitigate its losses.” Likewise, the A/G v. Kazakhstan tribunal
affirmed that “[mlitigation of damages, as a principle, is applicable in a wide range of situations.
It has been adopted in common law and in civil law countries, as well as in International
Conventions and other international instruments.””> The EDF v. Argentina tribunal considered

that “the duty to mitigate damages is a well-established principle in investment arbitration.”””° In

Dunkeld, the tribunal premised the requirement to resort to a domestic compensation process in

we , wee 2
certain circumstances on the existence of duty to mitigate.*””

201. As well as being recognized as a principle, several investment tribunals have applied the duty to
mitigate. For instance, the BRIDAS v. Turkmenistan tribunal reduced compensation of US$ 495
million by US$ 50 million due to the claimant’s failure to mitigate.” In Achmea v. Slovak
Republic, the tribunal held that the suspension of operations was “a reasonable defensive measure,
intended to minimize the risk of further losses,” and accordingly rejected the respondent’s

argument that the claimant failed to mitigate loss.”

202. NAFTA contains no express lex specialis with respect to the duty to mitigate. As a result, the

general rules of State responsibility apply.

203. Having established that, in principle, a duty of mitigation of damages can arise in public
international law, including in the context of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, the Tribunal shall now turn

to the content of such a duty.

204. By its nature, the duty to mitigate is a restriction on compensatory damages. The rationale of the
duty to mitigate damages is to encourage efficiency and to minimize the consequences of unlawful
conduct (such as a breach of treaty). The duty to mitigate applies if: (i) a claimant is unreasonably
inactive following a breach of treaty; or (ii) a claimant engages in unreasonable conduct following

a breach of treaty.

205. The first limb of the mitigation principle concerns the unreasonable failure by the claimant to act
subsequent to a breach of treaty, where it could have reduced the damages arising (including by
incurring certain additional expenses). The second limb, conversely, concerns the unreasonable
incurring of expenses by the claimant subsequent to a treaty breach, which results in increasing

the size of its claim.

2. Content of Duty of Mitigation in the Present Case

206. In the present case, there is no suggestion that the Investors have incurred unreasonable expenses

after the NAFTA breach, for which they now seek compensation from the Respondent (the second

Republic), Final Award, 7 December 2012, para. 320.

limb of the mitigation principle). In fact, any expenses incurred in the weeks after the adoption of
the JRP Report in 2007 appear to be minimal, and ostensibly directed at influencing or reversing
the subsequent decisions of the federal and Nova Scotia Governments. Rather, the Respondent’s
mitigation argument is focused on the first limb of the mitigation principle. The Respondent
contends that the Investors were unreasonably inactive following the NAFTA breach, by failing
to have recourse to judicial review of the decisions of the federal and Nova Scotia Government

where that could be expected of them.

207. The Tribunal notes that what the Respondent considers judicial review could achieve is not so
much the mitigation of the damages incurred by the Investors, but a reversal of the Investors’
injury. The Tribunal has doubts, however, that the Investors’ duty to mitigate extends so far as to

undo the injury (rather than limiting the consequent financial damages).

208. Moreover, the Tribunal observes that it has not found, in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability
or the present Award, that the Investors would have had an automatic right to another JRP process
if only they had resorted to judicial review. Rather, as the Respondent and its principal expert on
this point, Justice Evans, appear to acknowledge, judicial review would only have offered the
Investors the opportunity to try to obtain the right to another JRP process.”*” While Justice Evans
regards the granting of such remedy to be likely, “in view of the errors of domestic law identified

17,23!

by the Tribunal it remains the case that “[t]he grant of relief is in the discretion of the

reviewing court”.””

209. In any event, in the Tribunal’s view, judicial review could not have reversed entirely the injury
incurred by the Investors in this case (i.e. the loss of the opportunity to be subject to a process that
was consistent with NAFTA requirements). In its Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal
concluded that the conduct of organs of the Canadian Government was inconsistent with NAFTA.
Chapter Eleven (rather than with Canadian law); whether or not a Canadian court in domestic
judicial review proceedings would and could have remedied that specific violation of international
law is an open question, on which the Parties have not briefed the Tribunal. Conceptually,

however, the loss of an opportunity to have one’s project assessed consistently with Canadian law

under review does not meet these standards.”); Hearing Transcript, 28 February 2018, p. 2592, lines 14-17 (“If
there are concerns regarding the unfairness or bias against the claimants, the Court could have remitted the EA

is distinct from the loss of an opportunity to have one’s project assessed consistently with an
international treaty. It is the loss of the latter opportunity that constitutes the Investors’ injury in

the present case.

210. Furthermore, in the Tribunal’s view it cannot be said that judicial review followed by a new EA

would have restored to the Investors the same opportunity that they have lost. Judicial review
would have offered a different remedy, with its own advantages and disadvantages, but it could
not have fully mitigated the specific injury caused in this case. The qualitative difference of
administrative or judicial review and damages claims is recognized NAFTA Article 1121, as the

Respondent has rightly pointed out in another context.”**

211. It is correct that the duty of mitigation under public international law may in principle include

recourse to administrative remedies and/or judicial review. In Dunkeld, an arbitration arising out
of a shareholder challenge of Belize’s compulsory acquisition of shares, the tribunal found that
Dunkeld was obliged in the specific circumstances to mitigate its loss, and did so on the facts by
availing itself of the domestic compensation process in Belize.**' The paragraph of the Dunkeld
award which the Respondent cited in its Counter-Memorial underscores that the duty to mitigate

may require that the claimant attempt local remedies,”

especially in circumstances where
domestic administrative procedures offer a “more rapid or certain” remedy.*° However, the
Dunkeld tribunal emphasized that this duty was limited to reasonable steps in the specific
circumstances of each case,”*” and that such duty could not lead to the claimant having to forego

international remedies.

212. The present case differs in an important respect from Dunkeld. Dunkeld was concerned with the

233,

234

235

236

237

narrow question of compensation for the direct expropriation of shares for which the Government
of Belize established a dedicated domestic valuation process. It was common ground that the
Government of Belize had acquired the shares. In the present case, by contrast, the questions that
Canadian courts would have considered on judicial review, and that this Tribunal has considered,

are the main complex of questions concerning the Respondent’s compliance with applicable

Canadian laws and, insofar as this Tribunal is concerned, with NAFTA Chapter Eleven in

conducting an EA.

213. Finally, it would seem to this Tribunal that, in assessing what remedies a claimant may be
expected to have recourse to in a given case in fulfilment of a duty of mitigation, a court or tribunal
should take account of the procedural rights granted to that claimant under the underlying treaty.
In particular, the mitigation requirement must not lead to the imposition of a requirement of
exhausting local remedies where there is none provided for in the treaty. Many forms of injury
for which NAFTA Chapter Eleven provides a forum for damages claims might in theory be
mitigated by pursuing local remedies, possibly involving several layers of court review. The
NAFTA drafters did not intend to require claimants to systematically pursue local remedies before
recovering their losses in international proceedings. The Tribunal must give effect to that
judgment of the parties to NAFTA (“NAFTA Parties”) and avoid introducing a local remedies

requirement through the backdoor of mitigation.

214. For all these reasons, the Tribunal finds that in the present case the duty of mitigation of damages

did not entail a duty to challenge the JRP Report through local judicial review.

w

. Reasonableness of Non-Pursuit of Judicial Review after the Treaty Breach

215. In any event, even if one considered that the duty of mitigation of damages in the present case did
extend to judicial review, the Tribunal finds that it was not unreasonable for the Investors to refrain
from seeking to re-establish the lost opportunity of having their project assessed consistently with

NAFTA through judicial review proceedings.

216. After the JRP Process had proceeded the way it did, it was not unreasonable for the Investors to
assume that it would be difficult to rebuild the relationship with the local population around
Whites Point. Following the JRP Process, a significant proportion of the local population was
opposed to the Investors and their project.” The Tribunal recalls that, in the first phase of these

proceedings, it was presented with evidence of vandalism against the Investors’ property and

exhaust local remedies); see also Thomas Wiilde and Borzu Sabahi, ‘Compensation, Damages and Valuation’
in Peter T. Muchlinski, Federico Ortino, Christoph Schreuer (eds.), The Oxford Handbook of International
Investment Law (OUP 2008) 1097 (“*...reasonable, practically and easily available domestic remedies do have
to be used to mitigate damages, but that should be within a relatively wide ‘margin of appreciation’ for the
claimant. The mitigation principle should also not be used to bring in through the back door the principle of
exhaustion of domestic remedies when the treaties have clearly excluded it”).

Award on Damages

threats against them and their supporters while the EA process was ongoing." The point here is
not, as the Investors have argued, that there was an environment of systematic bias against the
Investors within the Canada’s federal or provincial Governments (a proposition that the Tribunal

does not regard as established);*"

rather, the Tribunal accepts that there was a reasonable basis
for the Investors to judge that, even if they succeeded in judicial review, such legal remedy would
not necessarily undo the loss of their opportunity. Successful judicial review may not have
returned to them the opportunity they lost, given the persisting effects of the NAFTA breach on

the ground.

217. The Tribunal also considers that it was not unreasonable for the Investors to conclude, as they did,

that a do-over of the environmental assessment would have been costly. As Mr. Buxton has
testified, the data submitted during the original EA was unlikely to be current enough to be
resubmitted to a new JRP.*? The Tribunal tends to regard Mr. Buxton’s view as more plausible
than the Respondent’s suggestion, based on Justice Evans’ report, that the same expert reports
could have been resubmitted in essentially the same form.” In any event, the Tribunal has no
doubt that the Investors were reasonably advised by their technical consultant, Mr. Buxton, that

the costs of a new EA would be significant.

218. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that it was not unreasonable for the Investors in the specific

circumstances of the case to refrain from engaging in judicial review.

219. In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal expressly leaves open the question whether mitigation

240

241

measures might have been reasonably expected of the Investors to minimize the size of a claim
for lost profits. One might have expected the Investors actively to have identified other quarry
projects, in Canada or elsewhere, that could have met the Investors’ needs for the five decades to
come. One might equally contemplate whether, in a “but for” scenario where the profitable
operation of a quarry at Whites Point for five decades was virtually certain, the Investors would
have been expected to seek approval of a redesigned quarry project through a new EA application.

profits, however, the Tribunal is not required to make any findings with regard to such a “but for”

scenario.

VI. CALCULATION OF DAMAGES

220. Having determined the heads of damages to which the Investors are entitled, the Tribunal shall

now turn to the quantification of such damages. It is evident that the amount of damages to be

awarded is closely related to questions of causation and mitigation. The Parties have presented

arguments on quantum in respect of different, mutually exclusive causation and mitigation

scenarios:

Were the Tribunal to find that the Respondent’s NAFTA breaches could have been
mitigated easily, the Respondent argues that the Investors should be entitled only to the

costs they would have incurred to mitigate their losses (“Mitigation Costs”).

Were the Tribunal to find that the Respondent’s NAFTA breaches cannot be proven to
have affected the ultimate result of the permit application, the Respondent argues that
the Investors should be entitled only to the reimbursement of the costs of the faulty JRP
Process, having lost a fair opportunity to have their application considered but no more

(“JRP Process Costs”).

Were the Tribunal to conclude that, but for the breach, the permit would have been
granted and the Whites Point Project would have proceeded, the types of damages to be
awarded by the Tribunal would be different. Under this scenario, the Investors argue that
they should be awarded lost profits on the basis of a discounted cash flow (“DCF”)
method (“Projected Lost Profit”).“* The Respondent, on the other hand, argues that,
since the investment was never in operation and its future profitability is uncertain, the
Investors are only entitled to damages equivalent to their actual investment costs

(“Investment Costs”).”4°

221. The Tribunal has already determined that the Investors are entitled to compensation equivalent to

the value of the opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed

in a fair and non-arbitrary manner. In its analysis below, the Tribunal will thus address only the

quantification of that opportunity. Before doing so, however, the Tribunal will briefly restate the

Parties’ positions in respect of the various causation and mitigation scenarios discussed by them.

THE PARTIES’ VALUATION UNDER VARIOUS CAUSATION AND MITIGATION SCENARIOS

222. As noted above, the Respondent’s primary case is that the Tribunal should award no damages to

the Investors.”° In the alternative, the Respondent suggests that the Investors might be entitled to
Mitigation Costs; in the further alternative, the Respondent considers that the Investors might be
entitled to JRP Process Costs; and in the further alternative, the Respondent argues that the
Investors should at most be entitled to sunk Investment Costs. The Respondent's three alternative
approaches to valuation are summarized below. The Tribunal will finally summarize the

Investors’ case for Projected Lost Profit.

1. Mitigation Costs

223. Under the first scenario, the assumption is that it would have been possible for the Investors to

mitigate all their losses suffered as a result of the NAFTA breaches by the Respondent by means
of domestic judicial review, which would have been followed by a fresh and untainted JRP

Process.

a. The Respondent’s Position

224. As noted above, the Respondent submits that, pursuant to the Investors’ obligation to mitigate

246

247

248

249

their losses, the damage incurred by the Respondent’s NAFTA breaches would have been easily
and effectively cured, had the Investors pursued their remedies before Canadian domestic courts.
Accordingly, the Investors would be entitled to total costs of C$ 1,150,644.” The amount
proposed by the Respondent is based on the Expert Report of Mr. Darrell B. Chodorow of the
Brattle Group (“Brattle Group Report”) which. The mitigation costs include: (i) legal costs in the
248

judicial review process: C$ 77,982;
constituted JRP: C$ 1,072,662.”

and (ii) costs of remitting the assessment back to a newly

Award on Damages

b. The Investors’ Position

225. The Investors do not expressly dispute the Respondent’s calculation, since they exclusively argue
that they are entitled to recover lost profits and focus their valuation of damages on that

presumption.

2. JRP Process Costs

226. Under the second scenario, the assumption is that a different JRP Process conducted on a basis
that was consistent with NAFTA might still have led to the rejection of the Whites Point Project,
either as a result of the recommendation of the JRP or as a result of the Government's exercise of

its discretion in deciding on the approval of the Whites Point Project.

a. The Respondent’s Position

227. In this scenario, the Respondent submits that the Investors can only recover the costs incurred by
Bilcon of Nova Scotia in the JRP Process which, first, can be substantiated, and, secondly,
occurred when the JRP Process was ongoing, i.e. between 3 November 2004 (the date when the
JRP was established) and 22 October 2007 (the date when the JRP issued its Report),”*° as this is
the period during which the Tribunal found that the Respondent’s violations of NAFTA took
place: “The JRP could not have taken any actions either before it was constituted or after it
submitted its Report.”?*!

228. The Respondent submits that the amount of damages has to be proven by the Investors and can
by no means exceed cs In arriving at this number, the Respondent refers to the
Brattle Group Report, pursuant to which the following estimates are made: (i) payment to
individuals and firms contributing to the EA (“Consulting Experts”): co iii” (ii) payments
to government entities for the JRP itself and related costs (“Panel Costs”): C$ | | and
(iii) payments for office and operational expenses (“Office & Operations”): cs Yet,

according to the Respondent, as of the date of the submission of the Respondent’s Rejoinder, only

cs iii” of said amount had been substantiated.”

b. The Investors’ Position

229. In their written submissions, the Investors do not expressly dispute the Respondent's calculation,
since they exclusively argue that they are entitled to recover lost profits and focus their valuation

of damages on that presumption.

230. However, some objections to the Respondent’s assumptions are found in the Reply Witness
Statement of Mr. Paul Buxton (“Buxton Reply Statement”), in which Mr. Buxton notes that “all
of the costs incurred by the Investors in relation to the environmental assessment should be

included in the calculation of historic costs,”?°>

and the calculation should cover the period from
the end of May 2002 (the moment when Mr. Buxton started preparing a study on the Whites Point
Project) to 17 December 2007 (the date when the Whites Point Project was formally rejected by

the Respondent).?*°

3. Actual Investment Costs or Projected Lost Profits

231. Under the third scenario, the assumption is that, had there been no breach, the permit to operate
the Whites Point Project would have been granted, and the Whites Point Project would have been
brought to profitable operation. Assuming such a “but for” scenario, the Parties disagree on the
type of compensation/damages to which the Investors are entitled. The Investors contend that they
are entitled to compensation of their lost profits, to be calculated on the basis of a DCF approach.
The Respondent submits that the Investors are entitled at most to a reimbursement of their actual
investment costs. Moreover, even assuming that the Investors should be compensated for lost

profits, the Parties disagree as to the methodology for quantifying such lost profits.

240. The Respondent adds that, for the Investors to be entitled to this amount of damages, they have

to first prove that it “is supported by invoice evidence and is therefore verifiable.”** As of 6

Investors have not claimed this type of loss, the Tribunal should consider awarding no damages

award but a lost profits award. Thus, the Tribunal cannot award damages that the Investors have

not requested.”*

ii. The Investors’ Position

241. The Investors elaborate that the principle of full reparation requires that tribunals “[examine] the

investor’s actual financial situation and [compare] it with ‘the one that would have prevailed had

the act not been committed’. In other words, the comparison is made with the situation which

19289

would have hypothetically prevailed using a ‘but for’ scenario,”**” i.e. the “differential method”.

290

In this respect, the DCF valuation method is used to calculate loss of future profits,” where on a

291 6

balance of probabilities basis“”' “the future cash flow is reasonably ascertainable and not purely

2 even if the investment has not yet been operational.?*> For these reasons, the

speculative,
Investors contend that the Tribunal should award them compensation based on the calculation of
lost profits." The Investors accordingly decline to specifically address the Respondent's

calculation of their sunk investment costs.

b. Projected Lost Profits

242. Assuming that the Investors are entitled to compensation of their lost profits, there remain

numerous points of disagreement between the Parties as regards the methodology for quantifying
such lost profits, including the valuation date, the assessment of market conditions and associated
risks, the projection of future revenue, the projection of costs, and the discount rate to be applied
to the projected net cash flow.7%> Moreover, the Parties disagree on the relevance of past
transactions and buy-out proposals in connection with the investment.” The Investors submit
that they are entitled to compensation in the form of lost profits, to be quantified in accordance
with a DCF approach. By contrast, the Respondent asserts that a DCF approach should not be
relied upon to calculate lost profits, and that at any rate the Investors’ DCF model “is rife with

flaws that result in a gross overvaluation of the project’s potential profits.”?"”

i. Valuation Date in respect of Future Earnings

243. The Parties disagree as to whether the valuation of damages (lost profits) should be made based

on information available at the date of the breach or the date of the award. While the Investors
argue that, for them to be fully compensated, the valuation must be made on the date of award,

298

taking recent developments up to such date into consideration,~”* the Respondent asserts that the

date of the breach (22 October 2007) is the appropriate valuation date.”

transpired in the ten years since Canada’s wrongdoing.”* Otherwise, the Tribunal would have

to “artificially create a proxy for the market outlook as of the breach date.”°°

In support of its position, the Investors refer to the awards in ADC Affiliate Limited v. Republic of
Hungary, El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic, Yukos Universal
Limited (Isle of Man) v. The Russian Federation, and Bernhard von Pezold and Others v. Republic
of Zimbabwe. The different tribunals in these cases essentially ruled that, “where the valuation
date was in dispute, compensation for [a] State’s illegal conduct (whether it is an expropriation
or [a] breach of another treaty provision) should be based on the higher value of the investment

at the date of the award” so that the principle of full reparation is respected.*°>

(b) The Respondent’s Position

While the Respondent agrees with the Investors that the principle of full reparation is applicable,
it disagrees with the Investors’ application of that principle. The Respondent contends that the
subject of valuation in this case is the Investors’ loss of opportunity to have their Whites Point
Project fairly assessed by the Government, and “if the loss of that opportunity is best valued by
calculating the lost profits of the Project, then those profits must be calculated as of the date the

opportunity was lost,” which was 22 October 2007, i.e. the date when the JRP issued its Report.*°

Particularly, the Respondent argues that using the date of the Award as the valuation date does not
put the Investors back in a position as if the breach had not occurred. Rather, it is the valuation
based on “the date immediately prior to the breach” that will result in full reparation.*” In
addition, the Respondent argues that a valuation at the date of the award, as requested by the

Investors, would “[enhance] the problem of hindsight.”*°* This is because the ability to “choose

between the ‘better’ of two valuation dates” would allow the Investors “to select, after-the-fact,
which valuation date best resolves the risk they faced.”*°? Accordingly, such approach would
result in more speculation and allow the Investors to adjust their business plan solely for the
objectives of calculating damages.*"? Moreover, the Respondent contends that calculating
damages at the date of the Award means that “none of [the Investors’ ] profits were subject to any

risk prior to [that date].”*!!

248. The Respondent submits that the cases cited by the Investors to support their proposition that the

valuation be made at the date of the award, should not have any influence on the Tribunal’s
consideration for different reasons. First, the Yukos award has been set aside.*!” Secondly, the
awards in ADC and Von Pezold cannot be applied to this case because both awards concern
unlawful expropriation cases where the value of the expropriated investments significantly
increased after the expropriation took place.*!* Lastly, the Respondent points out that all of the
cases cited by the Investors involve investments that were going concerns,*" unlike the Whites

Point Project, which was in its early development stage.

(c) The United States’ Article 1128 Submission

249. Given the requirement that compensation must be causally related to the breach, the United States

suggests that the Tribunal should be cautious when valuing damages at the date of an award
instead of at the date of the NAFTA breach in question, as events occurring after the breach may

lack “sufficient causal connection to the breach.”*!°

and New York aggregates markets in the years following the Respondent’s breach, the risk

associated with the Whites Point Project, and the relevance of such factors for the purposes of

determining the Investors’ compensation for lost profits.

(a) The Investors’ Position

251. Asa general matter, the Investors emphasize that “the fact of a loss” and “the quantum of that
loss” are two different elements. That is, while a claimant is obliged to prove on a balance of
possibilities that the fact of a loss is certain, it is not required to prove the exact amount of loss
with the same degree of certainty, as such quantification is inherently speculative and difficult to

prove, and always involves some degree of estimation.

252. Bearing that in mind, the Investors view the market conditions in which they would have operated
but for the breach as very favourable ones. They submit that construction spending in New York

City and New Jersey “reached record levels in recent years”?'®

and, overall, “stone imports [in
the United States] have been growing at an average annual rate of roughly 8% since 1993.”3!”
Similarly, the aggregate production in Nova Scotia has consistently risen since 1925.*'* While the
Investors admit that the 2008 economic crisis led to difficult years thereafter, they contend that
“the market was rebounding” by 2012.*"° Further, they argue that the market entry of products
from the Whites Point Project would not have driven down the overall market price, |
ee
fC Lastly, the Investors argue that given their strong record of success and their
expertise in the industry, the Whites Point Project would not have encountered project
development and permitting risks as asserted by the Respondent (provided that their investment
had received “fair, honest, and non-discriminatory treatment” from the Government at the

permitting stage).*?!

253. In sum, citing the Expert Reports of Mr. Michael Wick (“Wick Report”) and of Mr. John Lizak

(“Lizak Report”), the Investors argue that the regional market has always been robust and that it
would have absorbed their aggregates produced at the Whites Point Project.*” As such, the
Investors’ market share in New York City would hv ii -_ 7 _____

(b) The Respondent’s Position

254. The Respondent emphasizes the negative effect of the 2008 economic crisis. It notes that “market

conditions leading up to the global financial crisis were uncertain and that prospects for the

9324

aggregates markets were negative, and that “[iJn particular, construction spending in the

United States was in decline, shipments of aggregate had dropped, and the last quarter of 2007

was the seventh sequential downturn in aggregates demand.”*>

According to the Respondent, this
assessment is supported by another operators’ decision not to proceed because of the “Financial
Meltdown”, despite its project being released from environmental review in 2007.*”° Specifically,
citing the Brattle Group Report, the Respondent asserts that “[s]hipments [of] aggregates had
dropped by nearly 20% between 2006 and 2007, and the last quarter of 2007, when the alleged
breach occurred, was the seventh sequential downturn for aggregates markets.”*’ The
Respondent notes that due to this negative market development the proponents of the Belleoram

project decided not to proceed notwithstanding the project approval.*”

255. As regards the supply side, the Respondent contends that the increase in competition due to the

Award on Damages

256. In any case, the Respondent rejects the Investors’ focus on New York City as its market

destination. According to the Respondent, prior to the NAFTA breaches, the Investors had never
had the intention to ship the aggregates to New York. The Investors’ original business plan in
2004, their environmental impact statement, their information provided to the JRP, Mr. Buxton’s
testimony, and Mr. Lizak’s testimony, always mentioned New Jersey as the primary market
destination of the aggregates from the Whites Point Project.**° In the Respondent’s view, the
Investors later included New York as its market because “the prices are 45, 50% lower in New
Jersey.”**! Therefore, Messrs. Lizak, Wick, and Rosen wrongly focus on the prices of the

aggregates in New York in their analyses.**

257. Lastly, given the early stage of development of the Whites Point Project when the breach occurred,

the valuation has to take into consideration development and permitting risks.**

iii. | Projected Production Costs

258. The Parties disagree significantly as to the projected amount of the costs of the Whites Point

Project. While there are various points to note (as summarized below), the principal difference

appears to lie in the estimated yield rate of the aggregate production at the Whites Point Project.

fact, Mr. Rosen has agreed with the Brattle Group Report’s approach in one respect—regarding
the “unlevered betas”, which results in a reduction of Mr. Rosen’s discount rate from 5.78% to
5.41%. Ultimately, Mr. Rosen submits that, by adopting all the adjustments that the Brattle Group

Report points out, the discount rate would decrease from 5.78% to 5.10%.°°

(b) The Respondent’s Position

272. The Respondent contends that Mr. Rosen made four mistakes when he calculated the discount

rate. First, he relied on a backward-looking cost of debt input in calculating forward-looking cash
flows. Secondly, he incorrectly calculated the “unlevered betas” underlying his own discount rate.
Thirdly, he applied a wrong formula to convert his own nominal discount rate to a real discount
rate. Lastly, he used only the 2017 and 2018 inflation rates “when longer-term rates would have

been more appropriate.”

vi. Past Transactions and Other Comparable Transactions in the Market

273. The Parties disagree over the use of pre-breach transactions or proposed transactions as “market

indicators” of the value of the Whites Point Project for the purposes of determining the Investors’

compensation for lost profits.

(a) The Investors’ Position

274. The Investors assert that these transactions are in no way relevant to their lost profits. They refer

to the Expert Reply Report of Mr. Howard Rosen (“Rosen Reply Report”), in which Mr. Rosen
notes that “[fJull reparations are ultimately concerned with the perspective of the Investors rather
than the views of the general market.”*°’ In any case, according to the Investors, these past
transactions referred to by the Respondent do not represent accurate market indicators as they
either took place at the time when the Whites Point Project was still at its very early stage or were

not in the Investors’ interest.*°*

(b) The Respondent’s Position

. Conversely, the Respondent argues that the Investors’ DCF valuation “is exponentially higher
than their past behavior and other market indicators.”*? Thus, “[t]hese transactions illustrate the

excessive results that the Investors’ DCF calculation of lost profits produces.”*”°

4. The Tribunal’s Comments on the Valuation Approaches Proposed by the Parties

As the Tribunal has noted above, the Investors have failed to prove, to the standard applicable
under international law, that the Whites Point Project would have obtained environmental
approval. The Tribunal’s analysis of the Investors’ lost profits claim ends here, as, without a high
degree of certainty as to regulatory approval, it goes without saying that no damages based on the

profitable operation of the quarry can be awarded.

In view of the volume of the evidence exchanged by the Parties regarding the business plan for
the Whites Point Project’s operation, which the Tribunal has carefully reviewed, the Tribunal
would nonetheless add that, even in the event of an approval, the long-term future profitability of
the Whites Point Project must be regarded as uncertain. This is notably due to (i) possible changes
in the Bay of Fundy ecology; (ii) possible new environmental regulations affecting quarry
operation and/or shipping; (iii) possible market changes affecting the need for basalt over time;
and (iv) possible macro-economic changes that may occur over the five decades of the projected

life of the quarry.

While uncertainty may in principle be reflected in DCF valuations, many tribunals have declined
to resort to DCF valuations of future profits where the investment is not yet a going concern,
which has not generated any historic cash flows. In the present case, the uncertainty affecting
future income streams is particularly pronounced. Not only was the quarry not a going concern
so that future cash flows, positive and negative, are difficult to predict; more significantly, the
evidence before the Tribunal is such that the Tribunal cannot, with a sufficient degree of

confidence, conclude that the Whites Point Project could have generated long-term profits.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that, even if it had found (contrary to its determination above)

that environmental approval for the Whites Point Project would have been a virtual certainty, it

would nonetheless have declined to award the Investors lost profits/compensation valued in terms

of future earnings.

THE TRIBUNAL’S VALUATION OF THE OPPORTUNITY LOST BY THE INVESTORS

The Tribunal must now address the value of the opportunity to have the environmental impact of
the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner, which it has found the
Investors have lost as a result of the Respondent’s breach of NAFTA. There are several indicators

of value in the evidence on the record, to which the Tribunal will have regard.

Primary Indicator of Value: Amounts Expended by the Investors

As a first and significant indicator of the value of the lost opportunity, the Tribunal has regard to
the expenditures incurred by the Claytons in pursuing the opportunity of developing a quarry site
at Digby Neck. From an economic perspective, the value of the opportunity to have the
environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner is
broadly equivalent to the value of the opportunity to develop the quarry site subject to the EA, as
the EA was a significant milestone on the path toward building the quarry, and there was no other
reason to undertake the EA than the intended quarry development. In the Tribunal’s view, it is
appropriate to take account of all expenses reasonably incurred by the Claytons (i) in the
preparation for the environmental assessment, (ii) during the JRP Process, and (iii) immediately
after the JRP Process to prevent and react to negative decisions from the Nova Scotia and federal

Ministers.

The rationale for this approach is simple: based on the evidence presented to it, the Tribunal has
no doubt that the Claytons have generally conducted their business operations like rational
business people. The Tribunal finds that this is also true in respect of their engagement in Nova
Scotia. Accordingly, the expenditures incurred by the Claytons, while not conclusive proof of the
value of their investment, may be presumed to stand in an objective relationship to the value of
the opportunity pursued. The expenditures are, in other words, an indicator for the value that a
rational business person would have seen in the opportunity presented by the Whites Point Project

in its pre-approval stage.

The expenditures made by the Claytons in pursuance of the opportunity of the development of a
quarry at Digby Neck are not substantially disputed between the Parties. While the Investors’

representative in Nova Scotia, Mr. Buxton, estimates the expenditures to amount to

PCA 224177 80

285.

286.

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

cs the Respondent’s expert arrives at a slightly lower global figure of
C$ te latter figure was confirmed by the CFO of the Clayton Group of Companies
(the “Clayton Group”), Mr. Forestieri, at the hearing. The Tribunal, having reviewed the

compilation of expenditures in Annex C to the Brattle Group Report, adopts the figure of

cs as a starting point.

The Tribunal notes, however, that it would be appropriate to take account of additional
expenditures that would have been generated in the immediate aftermath of the negative
recommendations of the JRP. Following years of engagement with government entities at the
federal and provincial level, it was reasonable for the Investors to seek to protect or restore their
opportunity by engaging with government officials and ministers in the face of the negative JRP
recommendations. In contrast, expenditures that relate to the preparation of a legal case against
the Respondent, as they appear to have been occurred as of 2008, are not relevant indicators of
the value of the Investors’ opportunity. The Tribunal considers that expenditures incurred up to
December 2007 should be taken into account in establishing the value of the Investors’ lost

opportunity.

The Tribunal is inclined to make a deduction in respect of the remaining value of Nova Stone’s
share in GQP, which was ultimately absorbed by Bilcon of Nova Scotia. In the Tribunal’s view,
there is no reason to assume that the value of that stake would have completely disappeared after
the JRP’s negative recommendations, although one may certainly expect that its value would have
declined. The Tribunal understands that nothing would have precluded another company from
taking over the lease over the quarry site with a view to developing a quarry itself, at a price that
would have reflected the opportunities presented by the site as well as the (by then confirmed)

permitting risks.

The fact that the Investors have not submitted payment slips or receipts in respect of all invoices
making up the amount referred to above is not relevant here.*”* The Tribunal recalls that it is not
seeking to establish the amounts invested by the Claytons with a view to ordering their
reimbursement to the entity that paid them. Rather it is seeking to establish the expenditures that
were necessary to generate the opportunity lost by the Investors in the present case. Invoices are

suitable documentation for the expenditures that were necessary.

287. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the minimum value of the opportunity lost by the Investors

must have been in the order of C$ | (or U' TT
| sd corresponding approximately to the amount expended by the

Claytons in pursuing the investment in Nova Scotia until it had become apparent in late-2007 that

the federal and provincial decisions denying the EA approval would not be reversed.

2. Secondary Indicators of Value: Past Transactions Regarding the Quarry Site

288. The amount of Ci however, does not reflect any prospect that return

on the investment might have been generated in the event of the successful permitting,
construction and operation of the Whites Point Project. No reasonable business person would
spend over uss on an opportunity whose value does not exceed that amount by some
reasonable margin. As the Gemplus tribunal has noted, even where income-based approaches are
inappropriate in view of the uncertainty of future income streams, the prospect of future earnings
must not be disregarded entirely. Such prospects inform the value of the opportunity that a

claimant has lost.*”

289. In establishing the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors in the present case, the Tribunal

need not rely solely on an “exercise of its arbitral discretion”,*”°

as the Gemplus tribunal appears
to have done. Rather, the Tribunal has the benefit of being able to refer to certain past transactions
made in relation to the Whites Point Project site, which allow it to establish an implied value
range of the investment opportunity presented by the Whites Point Project, as it was seen by
economic operators at different points in time. Three transactions in particular have been

discussed by the Parties.

290. First, in 2002, Bilcon of Nova Scotia paid US$ | to acquire yh CY

YY from Nova Stone. Against this backdrop, Bilcon of Nova Scotia and Nova Stone
entered into 5 pursuant to which the partnership named GQP was
formed (“2002 GQP Formation”). The Respondent’s expert, Mr. Chodorow, asserts that the total
value of the whole business of GQP contingent upon permitting would be uss at the

374 C$ 1 : US$ 1.0259; average closing exchange rate during the month of October 2007, as indicated by the Bank
of Canada (https: and-closing-rates/) (accessed on
1 October 2018).

time of the transaction in 2002.*”’ On the other hand, the Investors argue that the purchase price

did not reflect the true value of the Whites Point Project as it failed to take into account “the

unique circumstances and qualities of buyers and sellers”, ft

Second, in 2004, GQP decided to dissolve its partnership. To complete the dissolution, Nova
Stone agreed to sell its in GQP to Bilcon of Nova Scotia for US$ i (2004

of these transactions. The dark blue column represents the implied value as indexed to the

valuation date contended by the Respondent, 22 October 2007:

 

(Source: Brattle Group Report, Figure 14)

to the valuation date used by the Investors’ expert, Mr. Rosen, which is 31 December 2016:

 

(Source: Brattle Group Rejoinder Report, Figure 8)

295. The Tribunal’s task is to establish the value of the Investors’ opportunity when they lost it, i.e. in

late-2007. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds the figures set out in the first graph above, submitted

PCA 224177 84

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

by Mr. Chodorow with his first report, to be more significant for its present purposes. Since the
damages awarded to the Investors are subject to interest, which begins to run on 22 October 2007
(see paragraphs 316 et seg. below), the appreciation of the value of the Investors’ opportunity

between 2007 and 2018 is, at least partly, accounted for by the award of interest.***

296. As noted by Mr. Chodorow, the three transactions at issue 5

are not directly comparable to each other, or to the condition of the Project just before
the breach, because they reflect different stages of development and assumptions
about permitting. The offers, in particular, must be analyzed with care because they
do not reflect completed transactions.***

297. In considering the three transactions at issue, the Tribunal stresses that the 2004 GQP Buyout is

the only transaction in which a price was fixed expressly based on an unpermitted quarry. It
therefore encompasses fully the permitting risks that were attached to the investment opportunity
pursued by the Investors. Moreover, by 2004, the Investors and its joint-venture partner had
conducted various geological studies, and could thus be expected to have formed a realistic view
of the site’s economic potential.**° At the same time the EA process before the JRP, elements of
which the Tribunal has found to be inconsistent with NAFTA, was still in its early stages;
accordingly, there was little risk that the purchase price would have reflected elements of the

JRP’s conduct with which the Tribunal has taken issue.

298. However, the Tribunal also accepts the Investors’ argument that the Claytons may have paid less

The Tribunal feels that it should not rely on a value indexed to 2018 and award interest starting to run as of
2007, as this might compensate the Investors twice for inflation in the eleven years between the date of the
breach and the issuance of the present Award.

The implied value of the 2002 GQP Formation, of Us! was contingent on

permitting. Bilcon of Nova Scotia protected itself against permitting risks by limiting the amount

of capital it would have to contribute prior to the issuances of permits, and i

Ys Through these contractual mechanisms, Bilcon of Nova Scotia essentially avoided
the economic risks of the permitting process. The purchase price it paid is therefore not a reliable
indicator of the value of a mere opportunity to participate ina NAFTA-compliant EA process with

an uncertain outcome. Moreover, as noted by Mr. Buxton,

the environmental approval process would
take the form of a Comprehensive Study”.*”° To the extent that the 2002 GQP Formation reflects
permitting risks at all, such risks would thus have been underestimated. Finally, the Tribunal must
bear in mind that, in 2002, the exploration of the quarry site was less advanced than in 2004.
Given the more limited knowledge of the parties to the 2002 transaction, it is thus possible that

that transaction understates or overstates the value of the Whites Point Project.

3. Conclusions in Respect of Valuation

301. Having regard to the evidential record of the case, the comments by the Parties on it in their
written and oral pleadings, and the analysis of Messrs. Chodorow and Rosen, the Tribunal finds,

on the balance of probabilities, that the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors exceeded

the amount of Ci by a reasonable margin.

302. The Tribunal also considers, on the balance of probabilities, that the value of the opportunity lost
by the Investors remained below US$ | | in light of the early stage of the Whites Point
Project’s development and permitting risks. While the extent of the permitting risks is difficult to
measure, it is telling that market players other than the Claytons, on two occasions in 2002 and
2007, appeared to have been unwilling to absorb permitting risks. This suggests to the Tribunal
that such risks were considered significant. The implied values of the two transactions that do not
“price in” permitting risks must therefore be adjusted downward to serve as indicators of the value

of the opportunity pursued by the Claytons.

303. Based on the above, the Tribunal determines the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors in

respect of the Whites Point Project to be US$ 7 million.

VII. THE REQUESTED TAX GROSS-UP

304. The Tribunal must finally address the Investors’ request to gross up the amount of any damages
for lost profits awarded to them to offset the expected tax treatment of the damages in the United
States. The Investors submit that, in order to achieve full reparation, the Tribunal should take into
account the tax treatment of lump sum damages in its calculation of the Investors’ loss. The
Respondent objects to the requested gross-up on grounds of both law and fact. For the reasons set

out below, the Tribunal does not consider that a tax gross-up is called for in this case.

A. THE INVESTORS’ POSITION

305. Specifically, the Investors submit that, in order to achieve full reparation, the Tribunal should take
into account the tax treatment of lump sum damages in its calculation of the Investors’ loss.*? As

"393 which will be subject to U.S. tax laws.*” Particularly,

or indirectly through Bilcon Delaware,
the Investors contend that they will not gain any foreign tax credit from the receipt of damages.*”>
For this reason, the overall effective rate taxable on damages is higher than the overall effective
rate of tax payable on profits, which is the direct outcome of the Respondent’s breach.*”° Thus,

the Tribunal should allow a tax equity adjustment so that the Investors are fully compensated.*””

306. As for the Respondent’s contention that the Investors’ tax claim is based on the U.S. law that has

recently been repealed, the Investors assert that this adjustment does not have “any effect on the
tax equity adjustment as calculated by Professor Shay”.*** In any case, the Respondent asserts
that, as a common practice, the valuation of damages must take into account the legislation in
place at the time of valuation. Should there be any significant legal development thereafter, the

Tribunal should order the expert to modify its calculation in response to the change.*”

of taxation is needed to make the claimants whole, provided that the taxes are certain.“ Given
that “in this case, the applicable taxes have been established with certainty, including with regard
to the established practice between Canada and the United States under the Canada-U.S. Tax
Convention,” the Investors should be entitled to tax equity adjustment.“ In contrast, the Investors
contend that the Respondent’s opposition based on the awards in Mobil Investments Canada Inc.
and Murphy Oil Corporation v. Canada and Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v. Slovak
Republic is unfounded, as the claimants in those two cases failed to prove the actual tax

consequences of the tribunals’ awards of damages.“

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

308. The Respondent submits that the Investors’ argument is based on the flawed assumption that the

damages awarded to Bilcon of Nova Scotia will subsequently be paid as dividends to its
shareholder, Bilcon of Delaware, and in turn be transferred to the other Investors.*”? In fact, there
is no guarantee that the damages paid to Bilcon of Nova Scotia will be definitely transferred as
dividends to the Investors in the United States, and consequently be subject to United States tax
as claimed by the Investors.“ In any event, the Respondent argues that the Investors are not
entitled to compensation for damage incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia under NAFTA

Article 1116.4

309. The Respondent adds that even if the Tribunal were to accept the Investors’ argument that the

damages owed to Bilcon of Nova Scotia will be transferred as dividends to the Investors, past
investment arbitration awards do not support the Investors’ request for a tax gross-up."*° The
Respondent cites the awards in Mobil Investments, Ceskoslovenska, and Rusoro Mining Limited
v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela in support of its position.*”’ According to the Respondent,
in those cases the tribunals consistently held that “tax consequences in a foreign jurisdiction are
not relevant to determining the level of compensation.”“** As for the award in Chevron cited by

the Investors,*””

the Respondent contends that the situations in these cases were not comparable,
and the Respondent should not be responsible for another sovereign State’s income taxation of

damages awarded.*!°

310. At the hearing on damages in February 2018, the Respondent added that the tax code upon which

the Investors rely had been repealed.*'! The Respondent added that the possibility that foreign tax

legislation can change is another reason why it objects to the Investors’ tax gross-up claim.‘

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

311. In considering the Investors’ request for a gross-up of the amount of damages on account of the

expected tax treatment of compensation for lost profits, the Tribunal recalls, first, that it has
declined to award to the Investors damages based on lost profits, and has instead awarded an
amount reflecting the value of the opportunity the Investors have lost.‘'? Thus, the Parties’
analysis of the tax treatment afforded under United States tax law to profits of Bilcon of Nova
Scotia has only limited relevance, since no compensation equivalent to lost profits has in fact been

granted.

312. Secondly, in Chevron, the only award relied upon by the Investors in which a tax gross-up was

313. To the extent that tribunals have considered the tax situation in the investor’s home State,

4ul

412

413

416

47

granted,*"* the tribunal grossed up the damages award taking into account the tax law of the host
State, and not, as requested by the Investors here, the tax law of the investor’s home State." The
Tribunal recalls in this context that the Investors concede that no tax issues arise under Canadian
tax law. The Shay Report submitted by the Investors confirms that Canadian tax law will not tax

a damages award made by the present Tribunal:

[T]he fact that Canada does not tax damages means the amount of “residual” U.S.
tax will be different if Operating Profits are paid after Canadian tax compared with
the same cash amount of (as the after-tax Operating Profits) paid as damages not
subject to Canadian tax.*'® (Emphasis added)

47 they

appear to have concluded that there is no legal requirement on the part of a host country to
compensate an investor for taxes incurred there. For instance, the Ceskoslovenska tribunal held

that “[i]ncome taxes [...] are unrelated to the obligation of one party to fully compensate the other

8 and the Rusoro tribunal similarly held that “[aJny tax liability arising under [the

party’
investor’s home country’s] tax laws [...], does not qualify as consequential loss”.*!? The Tribunal

therefore observes that there is no relevant precedent in support of the Investors’ claim.

314. Lastly, the Tribunal does not consider that it would have before it all the necessary information to

calculate the amount of applicable taxes. The most current expert reports in respect of this issue,
submitted by the Investors, are dated August 2017, and they analyze the Investors’ tax liability
under the tax system then in force in the United States. The tax system in the United States has
since undergone changes,” as was recognized by Mr. Forestieri, Bilcon’s CFO, at the hearing.*”!

The amounts of the Investors’ U.S. tax liabilities for the present Award, if any, are thus uncertain.

315. Accordingly, the Investors’ request to indemnify them for any taxes that may apply to the present

Award in the United States is denied.

VIII. INTEREST

316. The Tribunal shall finally address the question as to the suitable interest rate and how such interest

rate should be applied to the amount of compensation quantified in the preceding Section.

317. The Parties disagree as to whether the Investors are entitled to pre-award interest.‘”? The Investors

423

have also made submissions on post-award interest,*“* which were neither specifically addressed

nor contested by the Respondent.

is appropriate.*** In addition, while the question of whether simple or compound interest should

yearly compounding of interest would be a reasonable or standard practice.*?>

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

In relying on the reports prepared by the Parties’ experts, the Tribunal is conscious that the experts
have considered the appropriateness of pre-award interest in respect of a remedy that is different
from the one ultimately ordered by the Tribunal, namely in respect of compensation for future
positive cash flows to be generated by the Whites Point Project. Given that, as Messrs. Chodorow
and Rosen agree, positive cash flows could not have been generated prior to 2015, any interest on

the Whites Point Project’s net cash flows can only be calculated from 2015 on.“

As described above, however, the Tribunal has decided to award compensation for the loss of the
value of the Investors’ opportunity to have the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project
assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner. The Tribunal has already noted that it considers that
opportunity to have been lost on 22 October 2007.’?’ Accordingly, any interest must begin to
accrue as of that date. In the Tribunal’ s view, the experts’ positions in respect of the rate of interest,
and its compounding, nonetheless offer helpful guidance to the Tribunal in determining the

appropriate interest in this case.

Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent shall pay to the Investors

interest on the principal amount of US$ 7 million,*?*

at the rate of the average one-year U.S.
Treasury bill yield for each corresponding calendar year. Such interest shall begin to accrue on
22 October 2007, and shall run until full payment of the present award has been made. Such

interest shall be compounded annually on the first business day of each calendar year.

PERMISSIBILITY OF COMPENSATION TO BE AWARDED UNDER NAFTA
ARTICLE 1116

The Respondent has argued that the relief requested by the Investors in the damages phase of the
present arbitration is impermissible under NAFTA Article 1116. In the present case, various
possible heads of damage were pleaded, ranging from mitigation costs to process costs, to “sunk”
investment costs, to lost profit. The Tribunal need not address the permissibility of all these claims
under NAFTA Article 1116. Rather, it will focus on the permissibility under Article 1116 of the
relief that it has decided to award—namely compensation in an amount equivalent to the value of

the opportunity lost by the Investors.

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

323. NAFTA Article 1116 provides:

1. An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that
another Party has breached an obligation under:

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or
(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the
monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party’s obligations
under Section A,
and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach.
2. An investor may not make a claim if more than three years have elapsed from the
date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge
of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.

324. NAFTA Article 1117 reads:

1. An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical
person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to
arbitration under this Section a claim that the other Party has breached an obligation
under:

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises), or

(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and State Enterprises) where the
monopoly has acted in a manner inconsistent with the Party’s obligations
under Section A,

and that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of,
that breach.

2. An investor may not make a claim on behalf of an enterprise described in
paragraph | if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
enterprise first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged
breach and knowledge that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage.

3. Where an investor makes a claim under this Article and the investor or a non-
controlling investor in the enterprise makes a claim under Article 1116 arising out of
the same events that gave rise to the claim under this Article, and two or more of the
claims are submitted to arbitration under Article 1120, the claims should be heard
together by a Tribunal established under Article 1126, unless the Tribunal finds that
the interests of a disputing party would be prejudiced thereby.

4. An investment may not make a claim under this Section.

325. The Tribunal recalls that the Investors had originally brought their claim pursuant to NAFTA.
Article 1116. Specifically, the Investors’ Notice of Arbitration, which marks the formal
commencement of the arbitration proceedings pursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules,

provides as follows:

Pursuant to Article 3 of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(SUNCITRAL”) Rules of Arbitration and Articles 1116 and 1120 of the North

American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), the Investors, WILLIAM RALPH
CLAYTON, WILLIAM RICHARD CLAYTON, DOUGLAS CLAYTON,
DANIEL CLAYTON and BILCON OF DELAWARE, initiate recourse to
arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration.’” (Investors’ emphasis)

326. At that time, the loss alleged consisted in the higher prices of aggregates to be paid by Bilcon of

Delaware as a result of the failure of the Whites Point Project—an injury of the Investors. There
is no question (and the Respondent does not dispute) that the original claim was correctly brought
under Article 1116.‘*° In the Memorial, however, the Investors focused on losses to Bilcon of
Nova Scotia to establish the amount of compensation owed to the Investors. This has raised the
question whether the new damages theory alters the nature of the Investors claim, such that it

could only be brought under Article 1117.

327. While the Respondent argues that the Investors “are precluded from personally recovering

damages in respect of wrongs done to the corporation [reflective loss]” pursuant to Article 1116,"*!
the Investors argue that they actually request damages for their own injury, i.e. “the loss in value

of their interest in Bilcon of Nova Scotia. (Investors’ emphasis)

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

328. The Respondent submits that Article 1116 does not entitle an investor to recover losses incurred

by its enterprise, ie. reflective loss. First, as the Investors’ claim for damages is based
fundamentally on their expert’s calculation of losses incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia, i.e.
reflective loss, the Respondent asserts that the Investors have no standing under Article 1116 and
that their claim is “impermissible” under Article 1116.“°° The Respondent adds that it is irrelevant

that Bilcon of Nova Scotia is in effect wholly owned by the Investors, as shareholders are not the

 

only relevant stakeholders in this instance.*™* Secondly, according to the Respondent, it follows

that the Investors have no standing to seek the lost profits of Bilcon of Nova Scotia, nor can they

recover the costs paid by Bilcon of Nova Scotia, as they were the enterprise’s losses.“* Thirdly,
although it recognizes that the Investors had standing under Article 1116 for their original claim,
the Respondent argues that as the Investors abandoned this path at a later stage of the proceedings
and never provided evidence to substantiate that original claim, they no longer have standing.‘*°
Fourthly, as regards to the Investors’ contention that, should its Article 1116 claim fail, the
Tribunal should treat their claim as if it were submitted under Article 1117, the Respondent argues
that the erroneous framing of their claim is no one’s but the Investors’ fault. Consequently, the
Tribunal should not act as counsel and revise the Investors’ pleadings at this late stage of the
Arbitration.” If the Tribunal would allow the Investors to amend and refile their claim under
Article 1117, it would be considered “unduly delayed, time barred and prejudicial to Canada.”***
For these reasons, the Investors’ claim for damages based on their experts’ calculation of the
amount of loss incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia must fail.” Also, the Respondent argues that

the Tribunal cannot grant an award on sunk costs.

329. The Respondent’s first argument is that the Investors have no standing under Article 1116 to claim

damages for loss incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia. The Respondent argues that Articles 1116
and 1117 deal with distinct matters, which the Tribunal should not conflate. While Article 1116
concerns losses of the investors’ (shareholders’) interest in relation to the enterprise, Article 1117
concerns losses incurred by the enterprise itself.““° Specifically, the Respondent asserts that:
(i) Article 1116 must be read together with Article 1117 as they collectively implement the same
principle of corporate law; (ii) Article 1121, if correctly interpreted, supports the Respondent’s
position; (iii) the distinctive treatment of Articles 1116 and 1117 is consistent with the object and
purpose of NAFTA; and (iv) the NAFTA Parties’ subsequent agreement and practice are in line

with this proposition.

330. First, the Respondent suggests that “Article 1116 must be interpreted in the context of

435

436

437

438

439

440

Article 1117,” which derogates from the fundamental corporate legal principle of separate legal
personality: Article 1117 allows investors to bring claims on behalf of their enterprises for

damages suffered by the latter, and the damages awarded shall be paid directly to the enterprises

under Article 1135(2).*' Under Article 1116, an investor may recover damages caused by a loss
of, inter alia, the right to receive dividends, of the right to vote, of an ability to transfer ownership.
Under Article 1117, the damages that may be recovered are lost profits or loss of an asset of an
enterprise.““” “Permitting investors to use Article 1116 to recover damages for losses incurred by
their enterprise,” the Respondent notes, would inaptly render Article 1117 “redundant” or of
“‘nutility”.“?

331. Furthermore, the Respondent contends that Article 1117(3) only creates a presumption that
Article 1116 and Article 1117 claims arising out of the same events should be consolidated; it
cannot be interpreted to support the Investors’ argument that a claim for reflective loss is
permitted, and certainly does not guarantee that, should the claims be consolidated, “monies paid

to the investment should flow through to the investor,” as contended by the Investors. ““°

332. Secondly, the Respondent rejects the Investors’ argument that the interpretation of Article 1116 in

the context of Article 1121, entitled “Conditions Precedent to Submission of a Claim to

Arbitration”, suggests that claims for reflective loss are permissible. Rather, the Respondent

argues, Articles 1121(1) and 1121(2) set out conditions precedent for claims brought under
Articles 1116 and 1117 respectively.” Moreover, the Respondent submits that the phrase “loss
or damage to an interest in an enterprise” (Respondent’s emphasis) pursuant to Article 1121(1)(b)
does not refer to “the enterprise’s own interests.” An “interest in an enterprise,” as stipulated in
Articles 1121(1)(b), 1139(e) and 1139(f), “8 the Respondent adds, means “the entitlement or right
to certain benefits regarding the enterprise” (such as legal entitlements to receive dividends, vote,

ownership, or transfer ownership),*”

and does not cover “fluctuating frequency or amount of
dividends” paid to the enterprise’s investors or reflective loss.’ In this case, as Bilcon of Nova
Scotia is still in existence, despite being non-operational, the Investors still retain all the legal

entitlements in relation to the enterprise. Therefore, they have no standing under Article 1116."°!

333. According to the Respondent, the Investors cannot argue that the distinction between

Articles 1116 and 1117 is a mere formality when it comes to an investment “wholly owned and
controlled by the investors.”*°? Article 1116 does not contain an exception for these kind of
investments and so, the tribunal cannot rely on an interpretation that expands its jurisdiction

beyond the consent given by the NAFTA Parties, pursuant to Article 1122.45

334. In addition, such interpretation would adversely affect other stakeholders (i.e. secured and non-

secured creditors, and non-claimant shareholders) of the enterprise. As an example, the
Respondent cites Article 1135(2), which provides that any award granted under Article 1117 shall
be paid to the enterprise. NAFTA Article 1135(2) protects the interests of others, such as the

minority shareholders and the creditors.*™ If shareholders were allowed to directly recover their

Article 1139(e) defines investment as “an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or

reflective losses, it would introduce “different priority rankings over corporate assets,” which in

turn would particularly harm creditors as well as minority shareholders*** and unsettle

predictability;** it would also alter tax treatments of the damages paid.**”

335. The Respondent submits that the object and purpose of NAFTA of ensuring a predictable

commercial framework, promoting conditions of fair competition, and increasing investment
opportunities require that the Tribunal maintain a clear distinction between Articles 1116
and 1117. Awarding damages to shareholders for reflective loss—in the present case to the
Investors for losses incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia—‘“will weaken the corporation’s separate
legal personality, create unpredictability [for stakeholders], create unfair conditions of
competition among these different sorts of investors, and hence inevitably decrease the
opportunities for investment in the NAFTA Parties.”“** In addition, it would “reduce the assets
available to creditors and non-claimant shareholders,” and lessen the possibility that a settlement
be reached between an enterprise and its counterpart, for the settkement would not prevent

shareholders from individually pursuing their claims.*?

336. The Respondent additionally points out that the situation of multiple and overlapping claims by

456

minority shareholders is another concern, as this might lead to difficulties in the quantification of
damages, risks of double recovery, and inconsistency of awards.*” Lastly, allowing shareholders
to claim reflective loss would disturb the corporate management structure, as a shareholder’s
move might harm the enterprise’s interests when its management is of the view that bringing a

claim against the State would not be an appropriate strategy.“*!

337. Thirdly, pursuant to Article 31(3)(a) and 31(3)(b) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties
(“VCLT’”), the Respondent asserts that subsequent agreement and practice in the application of
NAFTA by the NAFTA Parties must be taken into account.” In this respect, the Respondent
suggests that all three NAFTA Parties treat Articles 1116 and 1117 as distinct provisions and
acknowledge that investors can only recover direct damage, not reflective loss, under
Article 1116.“ In this respect, the Respondent submits that an interpretation of the Free Trade
Commission (“FTC”) is not the only mechanism from which subsequent agreement and practice

of States parties can be inferred.***

338. Applying Article 31 of the VCLT, the Respondent submits that the ordinary meaning of the text
of Article 1116 is clear, namely that “the claim is for losses incurred by the investor, not for losses
of an enterprise owned and controlled by the investor.“ Thus, the provision bars shareholders
from bringing claims for “reflective loss,” which the Respondent defines as “a loss of the
individual shareholders that is inseparable from the general loss of the corporation for wrongs

done to it“

or a shareholder’s loss that “would be made good if the company’s assets were
replenished through action against the party responsible for the loss.”“*’ This reading of the

provision is consistent with the core principle of corporate law of separate legal personality

recognized by domestic legal systems*** and customary international law.“ Had Article 1116
been intended to derogate from this important principle, the Respondent argues, it would have

expressly stated so.”

339. In any event, the Respondent submits that no NAFTA tribunal has ever established a general rule

that an investor’s claim for reflective loss is permissible under Article 1116.*7! Nonetheless,
should the Tribunal take the view that these cases permit an investor to recover reflective loss
under Article 1116, the Respondent argues that they are wrongly decided and should be
disregarded, since they are in conflict with the NAFTA Parties’ subsequent practice and
interpretation, and do not take into account problems resulting from such a permissive
interpretation.” In addition, such a decision would affect the consent of the NAFTA Parties to
arbitrate. In accordance with Article 1122, the NAFTA Parties “only consent to arbitrate claims
submitted in accordance with the procedures of the agreement.”“” In this case, the tribunal does
not have any jurisdiction to hear a claim that the Respondent, the NAFTA Party, has not consented

to arbitrate under Article 1116.4"

Respondent, the VCLT does not make any reference to the possibility of previous jurisprudence

settling the interpretation of a treaty provision.‘

341. In particular, the Respondent notes that in Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Government of Canada the
tribunal awarded damages for the investor’s own out of pocket expenses.*” It also criticizes the
United Parcel Service of America Inc. v. Government of Canada tribunal’ s treatment of distinction

between Articles 1116 and 1117 as “almost entirely formal’*”*

when these legal provisions on
standing are actually concerned with “what rights ought to be protected and how those rights
should be defined” and therefore are not “trifling technicalities”.“*” The Respondent noted that
in this case the tribunal never granted an award on damages and “to the extent that it allowed
standing to claim indirect loss, it was wrong, and need not be followed.”“! By contrast, the
Respondent asserts that the Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America tribunal treated
the distinction between the two provisions seriously, when it stated that “a NAFTA tribunal should
be careful not to allow any recovery, in a claim that should have been brought under Article 1117,
to be paid directly to the investor,” and that claimants should “consider carefully whether to bring

proceedings under Articles 1116 and 1117."4*

These statements show, according to the
Respondent, that “if a claim can be brought under Article 1117 for the enterprise’s losses, then it
must not be brought under Article 1116”.“*? As for the GAMI Investments Inc. v. United Mexican
States award, the Respondent notes that the tribunal warned that permitting an award on reflective
loss could lead to several insoluble challenges, like quantifying the amount a minority shareholder
could recover, the risk of double recovery and the possibility of inconsistent decisions for the

same loss to an enterprise.***

342. The Respondent’s second argument is that it follows that the Investors have no standing to seek

the lost profits of Bilcon of Nova Scotia. The Investors have submitted a damages claim for the
lost profits of the Whites Point Project, which are the loss of Bilcon of Nova Scotia, but not for
any losses they incurred directly. As the Respondent explains, “any dividends that they never
gained are indirect losses based entirely on losses of Bilcon of Nova Scotia.”“** Consequently, it
recognizes that such a claim could have been made under Article 1117, but it is “impermissible”

under Article 1116.*8°

343. For the Respondent it is irrelevant whether the losses of Bilcon of Nova Scotia were reflected in

the Investors’ tax returns. It is not determinative of whether the damage is direct or indirect. What
is determinative is “whether the right that has been infringed belongs to the shareholder or the
corporation.’”“*’ As the Respondent states “a foreign jurisdiction’s tax treatment for shareholders
does not change the fact that the enterprise incurred the loss when it lost the profits.”“** While the
Investors have not gained any dividends from Bilcon of Nova Scotia, they still have retained all
their rights and interest in it. Thus, their claim is simply one of indirect loss resulting from the

loss incurred by Bilcon of Nova Scotia and so, they have no standing under Article 1116.‘

344. The Respondent’s third argument is that this claim could have been brought under Article 1117,

but the decision not to do so was intentional, as the Investors revealed in their response to the

United States’ Submission.*” Therefore, the Tribunal should not amend the claim.

345. The Respondent further explains that, contrary to the Investors’ assertion that the Respondent

should be estopped from raising this objection to jurisdiction at this late stage in the proceedings,
the objection is not preliminary but was brought when the Respondent had its earliest
opportunity.“*! The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to “hear this claim for compensation as

brought by the claimants in the damages phase of the arbitration.”“°

346. According to the Respondent, the claim presents a new theory of damages, which is different from

the one first submitted by the Investors.*”* In paragraph 39 of the Amended Statement of Claim,

for example, the Investors stated underneath their “Damages” section:

The effects of these measures on the Investors include, but are not limited to, the
following:

a. The Investors have suffered in excess of US | in connection with
expenses incurred over more than five years on their application for a permit to build
and operate the quarry and marine terminal at Whites Point;

b. The Investors have been deprived of a vital source of basalt aggregate to supply
their business operations in the United States. Due to the resulting loss of the supply
of basalt, the Investors have experienced a major strategic disadvantage, as the
supply of aggregate in the Investors’ markets has become consolidated in ever-fewer
hands over the course of the environmental assessment process. As a result of this
strategic disadvantage, Bilcon may be forced to satisfy market demand at much
greater cost."

347. The Respondent relies on the Investors’ Memorial in the Jurisdiction and Liability Phase to

presume that the Investors came to the conclusion that investing in the Whites Point Project to
obtain a stable and secure supply of aggregate, would be much cheaper — even if it had to be
shipped to New Jersey — than acquiring aggregate to supply their operations at market price.*”*

So the damages they were originally claiming were
[t]heir alleged loss in their Statement of Claim, their sunk costs as investors and the

difference between the cost to supply their operations of New Jersey from Whites
Point and the cost to supply their operations from purchasing on the open market.’”°

348. Thus, the Respondent concludes that this was the reason why the claim was brought under

493.

494

495

496

497

Article 1116. The Respondent recognizes that the original claim could have been appropriate
under Article 1116.*°” In order to defend the claim, the Investors would have had to provide
evidence of sunk costs paid by the Investors, of actual purchases of aggregate made by the
Investors at market prices in New Jersey, and evidence showing how much it would have cost to

quarry and ship the same volume of aggregate from Nova Scotia to New Jersey. However, they

did not.“ According to the Respondent, the Investors decided to “trump up a phony business
plan solely for the damages phase of this arbitration and make a claim for the lost profits of Bilcon

of Nova Scotia.”*?

349. The Respondent nonetheless contends that the claim cannot be amended. The Respondent relies

on Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules,*” which provides that

During the course of the arbitral proceedings either party may amend or supplement
his claim or defence unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow
such amendment having regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to the other
party or any other circumstances. However, a claim may not be amended in such a
manner that the amended claim falls outside the scope of the arbitration clause or
separate arbitration agreement.

350. The Respondent concedes that amendments have been generally allowed if there was no undue

delay or prejudice to the other party. Nevertheless, it argues that in this case, there has been an
undue delay because the Investors knew about the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117,
“professed to have understood, and specifically and intentionally chose to file under
Article 1116.”°°! As a result, this claim is “impermissible” under Article 1116 and “it would be
entirely unacceptable and prejudicial to Canada to allow the claimants to amend it now and

advance a theory of damages that they never before had.”*"?

351. Additionally, the second sentence of Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules would not allow the

500

502

amendment either. According to the Respondent, the scope of the arbitration clause is Article 1116
and 1117. Both include a time limitation for the submission of claims of three years as of the
alleged measures. Since the JRP Report, i.e. the breaching measure, was published in 2007, the
amended claim would have had to be submitted before 2010. The Tribunal cannot allow to bring
a claim to be amended under Article 1117, as it considers it time-barred and outside “Canada’s

time-limited consent.”*"

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

Lastly, the Respondent explains why an award on sunk costs in the JRP Process is not appropriate
under NAFTA Article 1116. First, because the vast majority of the expenditures on the Whites
Point Project were paid by Bilcon of Nova Scotia, constituting the losses of the enterprise. The
appropriate standing for awarding these damages would be Article 1117. As a result, the Investors
do not have any standing to recover through Article 1116 the losses resulting from the costs paid
by Bilcon of Nova Scotia.* Secondly, even if Bilcon of Nova Scotia had standing under
Article 1116 for the Whites Point Project’s expenditures it had directly paid for, the Investors have
not been able to establish an appropriate amount for Bilcon of Nova Scotia’s sunk costs. While
Mr. Forestieri agreed with the estimates of the amount invested in the Whites Point Project
calculated by the Brattle Group, there is no distinction between the costs paid by the Investors
and those paid by Bilcon of Nova Scotia. The costs which the Investors, instead of the enterprise,
paid for some consultants, for example, would not be included in the sunk costs award to Bilcon
of Nova Scotia; nor would many of the receipts provided by the Investors which came from Ralph
Clayton and Sons Materials LP, a legal entity different from Bilcon of Nova Scotia, be so

included.*”

Another problem for any recovery under Article 1116 noted by the Respondent concerns tax
deductions. Since the Investors deducted the losses of Bilcon of Nova Scotia and Bilcon of
Delaware in their own tax returns, any damage award would have to be offset by the benefits they

gained.*°°

THE INVESTORS’ POSITION

The Investors complain that the Respondent has raised this submission on the “threshold
jurisdictional question of the [I]nvestors’ standing under Articles 1116 and 1117 of the NAFTA”
for the very first time in the damages phase of this arbitration, instead of the jurisdictional and
liability phase. Therefore, the Respondent should be estopped from pleading this argument ten

years after the arbitration commenced.*”

Nonetheless, the Investors’ submission on this issue is based on two main arguments: that they

seek damages for their own loss, i.e. “the loss in value of their interest in Bilcon of Nova

Scotia,”*°* (Investors’ emphasis) and that, in any event, Article 1116 allows the Investors to claim
for loss to their interest in an enterprise, i.e. reflective loss.*” In the alternative, should the
Tribunal not accept these arguments, the Investors argue that the Tribunal should disregard a mere

“procedural defect” and treat the claim as made under Article 1117.°!°

First, the Investors assert that their aim is to seek damages for losses incurred by the Investors
themselves. In support of their position, the Investors rely on the Expert Report of Mr. Howard
Rosen (“Rosen Report”). While the Investors admit that Mr. Rosen’s valuation is first based on
the calculation of Bilcon of Nova Scotia’s lost profits, they contend that it subsequently
determines “the money that the Investors would have received from the quarry operations, and

the loss of foreign tax credits that would have otherwise been available to the Investors.”*"! Hi

Le

Secondly, the Investors submit that Article 1116 permits recovery of reflective loss. Like the
Respondent, the Investors regard their reading of Article 1116 as consistent with Article 31 of the
VCLT.* As regards the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 1116, in light of the context of
the provision, the Investors argue that Article 1116 “does not limit or qualify the concept of loss
or damage in any way.”°!° According to the Investors, reading Article 1116 in conjunction with
Article 1121(1) confirms this position, because Article 1121(1)(b) stipulates that an investor’s
claim under Article 1116 can include a claim “for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise

that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly”, although it specifies further that, in order

to bring a claim under Article 1116, both the investor and the enterprise must waive their rights
to bring another claim concerning the same impugned measure.*”’ The reading of Article 1117(3)
also supports the Investors’ argument in their view, since it envisages that the same disputed
government measure may bring about a claim under both Article 1116 (for reflective loss incurred
by the investor) and Article 1117 (for loss incurred by the enterprise).°'* Consequently, the
Investors suggest that whether a claim should be brought under either Article 1116 or Article 1117,

or both, depends on the context and is subject to the Investors’ choice.*!?

358. In response to the Respondent’s argument that the Investors’ interpretation would render

Article 1117 redundant, the Investors argue that this would be the case only when claims are
brought under both Articles 1116 and 1117.°”° In addition, the Investors submit that Articles 1116
and 1117 serve a distinct purpose.*”' In particular, Article 1117 grants a national enterprise
standing in international arbitration, provided that the claim is brought by foreign investors on its
behalf. Additionally, bringing a claim under Article 1117 could be a more suitable option,
compared to Article 1116, should the enterprise be a going concern, as damages can be awarded
directly to the enterprise.*” By contrast, if the enterprise is no longer operational, a claim under

Article 1116 may be perceived as more practical.*?*

“settled meaning” as endorsed by previous arbitral tribunals, applying the provision in this manner

would preserve “a predictable commercial framework”.*”°

360. In support of its position, the Investors additionally rely on three NAFTA proceedings in which
Canada served as respondent and raised a similar argument in relation to the recovery of reflective
loss: (i) Pope & Talbot; (ii) SD Myers Inc v. Government of Canada; and (iii) UPS." The
Investors submit that in these cases, the tribunals rejected Canada’s argument.** In addition, the
Investors refer to two other NAFTA arbitrations in which the same issue was raised by the
respondents but was likewise rejected by the tribunals: (i) Mondev, and (ii) GAMI.° The
Investors thus conclude “that tribunals have developed a consistent interpretation of Article 1116

apply the settled interpretation put forward by the Investors.°>

shareholders to recover reflective loss,>*?

and that allowing claims for reflective loss is
“particularly important” where the enterprise is no longer operational.*™ That said, even if the
Respondent’s concerns were valid, the Investors submit that the text of Article 1116 is clear.
Accordingly, should the Respondent feel the need to prevent shareholders from claiming for

reflective loss, it must do so through amendment of the relevant NAFTA provisions.°*>

363. Alternatively, should this Tribunal decide that Article 1116 precludes shareholders’ recovery of

reflective loss, the Investors request that the Tribunal treat their claim as if it were brought under
Article 1117.5* This option, the Investors argue, would prejudice neither the Respondent nor third
parties, for the substance of the claim has been clear from the beginning.**’ In addition, since the
Investors brought this claim under Article 1116 pursuant to the settled interpretation of the
provision, it would be “manifestly unfair” if the Tribunal decided otherwise and left the Investors
uncompensated. Particularly, given that this matter is merely a “procedural defect”, the Investors’

claim should not be dismissed based solely on this ground.**

concerned with “discrete and non-overlapping types of injury”:

bring a claim under Article 1116. However, where the alleged loss or damage is only
to an enterprise that the investor owns or controls, the investor’s injury is only

365. The United States asserts that all three NAFTA Parties have consistently adopted this position. As

a result, pursuant to Article 31(3)(a)-(b) of the VCLT, the Tribunal shall take account of this

subsequent agreement or practice of the NAFTA Parties in interpreting Articles 1116 and 1117.°°

366. Further, the United States advises that these provisions were specifically drafted to address two

principles of customary international law: (i) that shareholders cannot bring claim for their
corporation’s loss*"' and (ii) that a State’s own national cannot bring an international claim against
the State.” In this regard, Article 1117 establishes an unconventional legal regime under which
controlling foreign shareholders of a national enterprise of the host State are entitled to submit a
claim on behalf of the enterprise for loss incurred by the enterprise.*** Conversely, Article 1116
“adheres to the principle of customary international law that shareholders may assert claims only

for direct injuries to their rights.”**

367. In addition, the United States argues that the reference to an investor’s “interest in an enterprise”

under Article 1121(1)(b) is limited to “legal entitlements or rights belonging to the investor (not
the enterprise).”** The United States notes that this position also serves various policy objectives,
such as the preservation of the separate legal identity of a corporation, the promotion of judicial
economy, and the protection of other stakeholders.™° To support its position, the United States
particularly cites the awards in Mondev and GAMI, which adopted a cautious approach in

determining the shareholders’ claims for losses incurred by their enterprises.*”

368. Lastly, the United States emphasizes that a decision to file a claim under either Article 1116

or 1117 is a serious choice to be made by an investor. It substantially affects subsequent litigation

strategies and a NAFTA Party’s consent to arbitrate, which hinges upon the different procedural

requirements specified under each provision. In particular, such consent “is limited to a claim for

loss or damage available under the specific article(s) pled.”*“*

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The issue before the Tribunal is whether damages can be claimed in this case under NAFTA
Article 1116. While the Investors initially brought their claim under Article 1116 in respect of
their loss resulting from having to pay higher costs for aggregates as a result of the failure of the
Whites Point Project, their claim in their Memorial focused on loss to Bilcon of Nova Scotia. This
has led the Respondent to characterize the claim as one for “reflective loss” claimable only under

Article 1117.

NAFTA Article 1116 permits claims by an investor where there has been a breach of NAFTA and
“the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach”. NAFTA
Article 1117 permits claims by an investor in respect of an enterprise that it controls directly or
indirectly where there has been a breach of NAFTA and “the enterprise has incurred loss or

damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach”.

Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties

The starting point for the interpretation of Articles 1116 is Article 31(1) of the VCLT under which
treaties are to be “interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given
to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose”. The critical
question in this case is the meaning of “the investor has incurred loss or damage” arising out of
the breach. The terms of Article 1116 do not make clear whether they are limited to direct loss or

they can include indirect loss that is, reflective loss.

However, if the words of Article 1116 are to be read “in their context” then Article 1117 has to be
considered. This provision allows an investor to claim for loss to an enterprise thus providing for
the recovery of reflective loss. As a result, to permit reflective loss to be recovered under
Article 1116 would raise questions about the relationship between the two provisions perhaps
rendering Article 1117 inutile. This is the point made by the Respondent. The Investors argue that

the potential for conflict only arises when claims are brought under both Article 1116 and

548 The United States’ Submission, para. 22.

PCA 224177 111

PCA Case No. 2009-04
Award on Damages

Article 1117, but this only reinforces the question of why Article 1117 was included into NAFTA

if claims can be brought for reflective loss under Article 1116.

373. Both the Respondent and the United States in their submissions argue that the inclusion of
separate provisions in Article 1116 and Article 1117 was deliberate. Article 1116 gave effect to
the traditional rule of customary international law that a party can sue for its losses arising out of
the breach of an international obligation. Article 1117 was designed to permit claims by an
investor on behalf of its investment, thus permitting a claim for reflective loss. In the absence of
that provision a claim for reflective loss would otherwise be barred under customary international
law by virtue of the ICJ judgment in Barcelona Traction, which rejected the right of shareholders

to bring claims in place of the corporation.

374. The Tribunal finds this to be a plausible explanation for the existence of the two separate
provisions in NAFTA Chapter Eleven, which would argue against overlap between them and

would mean that reflective loss could not be recovered under Article 1116.

375. Both Parties invoke the object and purpose of NAFTA in support of their position. The
Respondent claims that ensuring a predictable commercial framework, promoting conditions of
fair competition, and increasing investment opportunities all point to making a clear distinction
between Article 1116 and Article 1117. However, the Investors argue that allowing recovery for
reflective loss serves the purpose of encouraging better protection of investment. The Tribunal

considers neither approach particularly helpful in the interpretation of Article 1116.

2. Subsequent Practice

376. The Respondent and the United Sates reinforce their position on the interpretation of Article 1116
by arguing that it is confirmed by the consistent subsequent practice of the NAFTA Parties in their
submissions to investor-State tribunals.” The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent and the
United States in this regard, notwithstanding the fact that subsequent practice is only one of

several elements established by Article 31 of the VCLT to consider when interpreting a treaty.

377. Indeed, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Investors’ argument*”

that the power of the FTC to
make authoritative interpretations of NAFTA replaces the rule in Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT

that “subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the

parties regarding its interpretation” shall be taken into account “together with the context”. The
NAFTA Parties have an option to make a binding interpretation under Article 1131(2) but the fact
they have not done so means that treaty interpretation simply follows the normal interpretative
rules, which include taking account of subsequent agreements and subsequent practice of the

parties.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the commentary to the ILC draft conclusions on “Subsequent
agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the interpretation of treaties” includes
“statements in the course of a legal dispute” as potentially relevant subsequent practice of States

for the purposes of interpretation.*”!

On this basis, the consistent practice of the NAFTA Parties in their submissions before Chapter
Eleven tribunals in making a clear distinction between the application of Article 1116 and
Article 1117 can be taken into account in interpreting the provisions of NAFTA. Thus, the NAFTA
Parties’ subsequent practice militates in favour of adopting the Respondent’s position on this
issue, although only analyzing subsequent practices does not replace the primary rule of

interpretation of Article 31(1).

3. NAFTA Chapter Eleven Jurisprudence

. As the Parties have pointed out, the distinction between Article 1116 and Article 1117 has been

discussed by a number of NAFTA Chapter Eleven tribunals.

In Pope & Talbot, a U.S. company (Pope & Talbot Inc.), having a subsidiary in Canada (Pope &
Talbot Ltd.), claimed for losses caused by Canada’s export control regime for softwood lumber,
which implemented the 1996 Softwood Lumber Agreement between Canada and the United
States. Canada, the respondent in that case, argued that, since the investor had brought its claim
under Article 1116, it could not recover damages incurred by its Canadian subsidiary.**” The
tribunal found Canada’s argument unconvincing for two reasons. First, the language of
Article 1117 was permissive: it only provides that an investor, on behalf of its enterprise in the
host State, “may submit to arbitration.”>* Secondly, the wording of Article 1121(1) did not

support Canada’s case. The tribunal concluded:

It could scarcely be clearer that claims may be brought under Article 1116 by an

investor who is claiming for loss or damage to its interest in the relevant enterprise,

which is a juridical person that the investor owns. In the present case, therefore,

where the investor is the sole owner of the enterprise..., it is plain that a claim for

loss or damage to its interest in that enterprise/investment may be brought under

Article 1116. It remains of course for the Investor to prove that loss or damage was

caused to its interest, and that it was causally connected to the breach complained of.

But for immediate purposes the important point is that the existence of Article 1117

does not bar bringing a claim under Article 1116.°™*
The dispute in Mondev concerned the claim of a Canadian investor, Mondev International Ltd,
for losses caused by the City of Boston in the context of a land development project operated by
Mondev’s U.S. subsidiary. The claim was brought pursuant to Article 1116. Objecting to the
tribunal’s jurisdiction, the United States argued that the claim should instead have been brought
under Article 1117. The United States emphasized “the importance of the distinction between
claims brought by an investor of a Party on its own behalf under Article 1116 and claims brought
by an investor of a Party on behalf of an enterprise under Article 1117. The principal difference

relates to the treatment of any damages recovered.”***

In this regard, the Mondey tribunal stated, “a NAFTA tribunal should be careful not to allow any
recovery, in a claim that should have been brought under Article 1117, to be paid directly to the
investor.”°** The tribunal however noted that, even if the claim was brought under Article 1116 in
such circumstances the same objective could easily be achieved and the tribunal was prepared to
do so, by treating the claimant’s claim under Article 1116 as if it were brought in the alternative
under Article 1117. In other words, the tribunal appeared to treat the difference between
Articles 1116 and 1117 as a mere formality, stating that “[i]nternational law does not place
emphasis on merely formal considerations, nor does it require new proceedings to be commenced
where a merely procedural defect is involved.”**’ While the tribunal advised that it “would have
been prepared, if necessary, to treat Mondev’s claim as brought in the alternative under
Article 1117,” it cautioned that prospective claimants should take account of the distinction

between Articles 1116 and 1117:

It is clearly desirable in future NAFTA cases that claimants consider carefully
whether to bring proceedings under Articles 1116 and 1117, either concurrently or in

the alternative, and that they fully comply with the procedural requirements under
Articles 1117 and 1121 if they are suing on behalf of an enterprise.°*
In S.D. Myers, a U.S. investor, S.D. Myers Inc. (“SDMI”), set up a subsidiary in Canada (i.e.
Myers Canada Ltd.) to import Polychlorinated biphenyl (“PCB”) waste from Canada for
treatment in the United States. SDMI commenced arbitration pursuant to Article 1116, claiming
for losses resulting from Canada’s interim prohibition of the export of PCB waste to the United
States. The tribunal in S.D. Myers briefly addressed the relationship of Articles 1116 and 1117

under the heading of causation:

Article 1116 is relevant to the scope of recovery. It states that an investor can claim

for: ...loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of... a breach of Section A of

Chapter 11. Article 1117, which is not in issue in this arbitration, provides the same

remedy when an investor claims on behalf of its investment.*°° (Emphasis in

original)
By contrast, the matter of derivative claims was at the heart of the parties’ dispute in GAMI. A
U.S. minority shareholder, GAMI Investments Inc. (“GAMI”), claimed for losses of the value of
its shares in Grupo Azucarero Mexico SA de CV (“GAM”), a Mexican company, due to Mexico’s
expropriation of mills owned by GAM. The tribunal first addressed Article 1116 in the context of
jurisdiction, holding that “the fact that a host state does not explicitly interfere with share
ownership is not decisive. The issue is rather whether a breach of NAFTA leads with sufficient
directness to loss or damage in respect of a given investment.”* The tribunal decided that it had
jurisdiction over GAMI’s claim for its losses.**! The tribunal returned to the issue of derivative
claims in addressing GAMI’s expropriation claim. In this regard, it identified certain difficulties
attributable to the derivative nature of shareholder claims. First, the tribunal was concerned about
the allocation of compensation between a shareholder and its subsidiary, especially in a situation
where “unsynchronised resolution” of the same dispute by national and international jurisdictions
was a “practically certain scenario.”* Second, given that no dividend had ever been paid by

GAM to its shareholders, it was not clear why “GAMI’s recovery [should] be debited on account

of a payment to GAM.”** Ultimately, the tribunal did not have to decide these issues, as it held

that the claimant had failed to prove that Mexico breached its NAFTA obligations.**

In UPS, a U.S. company, United Parcel Service of America Inc. (“UPS”), operating through two
subsidiaries in Canada (United Parcel Service Canada Ltd. (“UPS Canada”), and Fritz Starber
Inc.), brought a case under Article 1116 claiming for losses resulting from Canada’s measures in
relation to UPS Canada. Canada objected to jurisdiction on the ground that UPS should have
brought its case pursuant to Article 1117 as the conduct complained of “primarily affects UPS
Canada rather than UPS.”** The tribunal disagreed. Having made the observation that “UPS is
the sole owner of UPS Canada,” it held that, at least in this case, the distinction between

Articles 1116 and 1117 was a purely formal one:

[The distinction] is without any significant implication for the substance of the

claims or the rights of the parties. UPS is the sole owner of UPS Canada. As such, it

is entitled to file a claim for its losses, including losses incurred by UPS Canada. If

there were multiple owners and divided ownership shares for UPS Canada, the

question of how much of UPS Canada’s losses flow through to UPS — the question

posed by Canada here — may have very different purchase. Whether the damage is

directly to UPS or directly to UPS Canada and only indirectly to UPS is irrelevant to

our jurisdiction over these claims.*°
The Tribunal concludes from the above that no consistent position on the distinction in the scope
of application of Article 1116 and Article 1117 has emerged in the Chapter Eleven cases. In neither
Pope & Talbot nor UPS was a claim to reflective loss seen as precluded under Article 1116. Yet,
in both Mondev and GAMI the distinction between the two provisions was seen as important.
However, in both Pope & Talbot and UPS, the tribunals emphasized the fact that the claimants
were the sole investors in the subsidiary. And, in Mondey, the tribunal warned against allowing

any recovery being paid to the investor where the claim had been brought under Article 1116.

The tribunal’s warning in the Mondev award not to allow payment of compensation to the investor
in the context of a claim made under Article 1117 shows the importance of distinguishing claims
for reflective loss under Article 1117 from claims under Article 1116. As the Respondent points
out, to allow an investor to recover under Article 1116 damages that belong to its investment could
have an impact on other stakeholders, including other investors in the investment. That is the

reason why recovery of monetary damages in respect of claims made under Article 1117 are to be

Award on Damages

paid to the investment vehicle and not to the investor pursuant to Article 1135(2)(b). The lack of
any equivalent provision in relation to Article 1116 carries the implication that reflective loss was

not contemplated under Article 1116.

389. In light of the above, the Tribunal is persuaded that the Respondent and the United States are in
principle correct. Articles 1116 and 1117 are to be interpreted to prevent claims for reflective loss
from being brought under Article 1116. This follows from the wording of Article 1116 in its
context, which includes Articles 1121 and 1135. Moreover, the Tribunal takes account of the

common position of the NAFTA Parties in their submissions to Chapter Eleven tribunals.

4. The Relief Awarded in the Present Case

390. The question arises whether the relief requested by the Investors in the damages phase of the
present arbitration is impermissible under NAFTA Article 1116.%’ As already noted above,
various possible heads of damage were pleaded, ranging from mitigation costs to process costs,
to sunk investment costs, to lost profit. The Tribunal need not address the permissibility of all
these claims under NAFTA Article 1116. Rather, it will focus on the permissibility under Article
1116 of granting the relief that it has decided to award—namely compensation in an amount

equivalent to the value of the opportunity lost by the Investors.

391. Would the award of compensation in an amount equivalent to the value of the opportunity to have
the environmental impact of the Whites Point Project assessed in a fair and non-arbitrary manner
be an award of reflective loss? In the circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal does not

consider that to be so.

392. First, it is clear that the opportunity to develop and submit the Whites Point Project for approval
was entirely an opportunity of the Clayton Group in New Jersey, which is owned and run by the
individual claimants in this case. They prospected quarry sites and invested their money in the

opportunity.

567 In the Notice of Arbitration, the claim was brought pursuant to Article 1116. At that time, the loss alleged
consisted of the higher prices of aggregates to be paid by Bilcon of Delaware as a result of the failure of the
Whites Point Project — an injury of the Investors. There is no question (and the Respondent does not dispute)
that the original claim was correctly brought under Article 1116. In the Memorial, however, the Investors
focused on losses to Bilcon of Nova Scotia to establish the amount of compensation owed to the Investors.
This has raised the question whether the new damages theory alters the nature of the Investors claim, such that
it could only be brought under Article 1117.

location of, and establishing the necessary approvals for, the investment were conducted by or on

behalf of the Clayton Group.

Thirdly, while for largely administrative reasons, the Investors conducted some of their dealings
through Bilcon of Nova Scotia, the sole purpose of Bilcon of Nova Scotia was to build and operate
a quarry, a role that it never got to fulfill. It was not an entity set up to establish and manage an
investment in a quarry and a marine terminal with the Claytons just as passive investors. The fact
that the Claytons used a local enterprise as an instrument for pursuing their opportunity, however,
does not turn that opportunity into Bilcon of Nova Scotia’s opportunity. Bilcon of Nova Scotia

was no more than a conduit to facilitate the Claytons’ operations.

Fourthly, to regard Bilcon of Nova Scotia as a separate entity in every respect would not be
consistent with the facts of the case. As far as the Tribunal is concerned, the Clayton Group was

not structured that way, nor did the Clayton brothers organize their involvement in the Clayton

ee: opportunity to invest in a quarry and a marine terminal, which was

denied by the Respondent’s unlawful conduct, was an opportunity of the Investors and not an
opportunity of Bilcon of Nova Scotia. Accordingly, compensation is owed directly to the Investors

pursuant to Article 1116. It is not precluded by the prohibition against awarding “reflective loss”.

397. In light of these conclusions, the Tribunal sees no need to address the Investors’ contentions that
the Respondent’s argument that the damages claim under Article 1116 has been brought too late,

or that the Tribunal should treat the claim as one made under Article 1117.

X. COSTS
398. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides, in relevant parts:

1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion
each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is
reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the
circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear
such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines
that apportionment is reasonable.

399. Having consulted with the Parties at the hearing on damages, the Tribunal has decided to fix the
costs of arbitration, and to determine their allocation, in a separate, final award on costs. The
Parties will be invited to file specific briefs regarding the costs of arbitration, taking into
consideration the Tribunal’s rulings in the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability and the Award on

Damages and any other circumstances that they regard as relevant.
