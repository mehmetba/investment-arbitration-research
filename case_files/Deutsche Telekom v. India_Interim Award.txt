I. INTRODUCTION

A. THE PARTIES
1. The Claimant

1; The Claimant is Deutsche Telekom AG (the “Claimant” or “DT”), a company
incorporated under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.

2. The Claimant is represented in this arbitration by Mr. Karam Daulet-Singh of
Platinium Partners, Mr. Samuel Wordsworth QC of Essex Court Chambers,
Ms. Sylvia Noury, Mr. William Thomas, Mr. Michael Kotrly, Ms. Ella Davies,
Ms. Annie Pan and Ms. Leonie Beyrle of of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP,
and Mr. Aman Ahluwalia.

2. The Respondent
3. The Respondent is the Republic of India (the “Respondent” or “India”).

4. The Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Messrs. George Kahale III,
Benard V. Preziosi, Fernando Tupa and Fuad Zarbiyev of Curtis Mallet-Prevost
Colt & Mosle LLP.

B. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE AND THE PARTIES’ PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

5. The present dispute arises out of India’s purported annulment of the agreement
for the lease of S-band electromagnetic spectrum on two satellites concluded on
28 January 2005 (the “Agreement” or “Devas Agreement”)! between DT’s Indian
minority-owned indirect subsidiary Devas Multimedia Private Limited (“Devas”)?
and the Indian state-owned company Antrix Corporation Limited (“Antrix”), The
Agreement inter alia contemplated offering mobile multimedia and broadband
data services to the Indian market via a hybrid satellite-terrestrial communications

platform (the “Devas System’).

6. In sum, the Claimant maintains that, based on political considerations linked to
the public scrutiny over the allocation of the terrestrial 2G spectrum, India

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 65 of 258

arbitrarily annulled the Agreement contrary to prior assurances by the Indian
Space Research Organization (the “ISRO”), the Department of Space (the
“DOS") and the Space Commission (collectively the “Indian Space Authorities”)
that they would allow and support the realization of the Devas System, including
by launching two satellites necessary to exploit the S-band electromagnetic
spectrum. According to the Claimant, the conduct of India constituted multiple
breaches of the 1995 Agreement between Germany and India for the Promotion
and Protection of Investments (the “Treaty” or “BIT”),? including unlawful
expropriation and unfair and inequitable treatment.

re In its Reply, the Claimant has formulated its prayers for relief as follows:

“341. On the basis of the foregoing, without limitation and expressly reserving
its right to supplement this request for relief in light of additional facts or further
action that may be taken by India in relation to Devas, its directors and / or its
shareholders, DT respectfully requests that the Tribunal:

(a) DECLARE that India is in breach of its obligations under Article 3 and 5 of
the Treaty;

(b) ORDER India to compensate DT fully for its losses resulting from India’s
breaches of the Treaty and international law, in an amount to be determined
in the second phase of these proceedings; such compensation to be paid
without undue delay, be freely convertible and transferable, and bear (pre-
and post-award) interest at a compound rate sufficient fully to compensate DT
for the loss of the use of this capital as from the date of India’s breaches of
the Treaty;

(c) DECLARE that:

(i) the award of damages and interest in (b) be made net of all Indian taxes;
and

(ii) India may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of
damages and interest in (b);

(d) ORDER India to indemnify DT:

(i) for any taxes India assesses on the award of damages and interest in (b);
and

(ii) in respect of any double taxation liability that would arise in Germany or
elsewhere that would not have arisen but for India's adverse measures;

(e) AWARD such further or other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate;
and

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 66 of 258

(f) ORDER India to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration,
including DT's legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal,

the fees and expenses of any appointing or administering authority, the fees
and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, plus interest, pursuant
to the discretion granted under Article 9(2)(b)(vii) of the Treaty and Article 40
of the UNCITRAL Rules.”*

8. The Respondent denies the claims. It primarily contends that three “threshold
issues” preclude the Claimant from asserting its claims in this arbitration. In
particular, the BIT (i) contains an essential security interests clause; (ii) does not
protect pre-investments; and (iii) does not cover indirect investments and indirect
investors. In any event, the Respondent submits that India annulled the
Agreement based on the policy decision to reserve a segment of the S-band
electromagnetic spectrum for non-commercial use by military and other security
agencies.

9. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent has formulated its prayers for relief as follows:

“274. For the reasons stated above, all claims asserted herein should be

dismissed and all costs of this proceeding should be assessed against
Claimant.”>

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

50. In this section, the Tribunal sets forth the main facts underlying the present
dispute in chronological order as they arise from the record. It will refer to
additional facts when needed in the context of its analysis. This section does not
reflect any finding of fact.

A. INDIA’S SATELLITE FREQUENCY SPECTRUM AND ITS ALLOCATION

51. Pursuant to the regulations of the International Telecommunications Union
(‘ITU”), India is entitled to various bands of electromagnetic spectrum, including
190 MHz of the S-band spectrum, which is the portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum in the frequency range of 2.5 to 2.69 GHz (S-band). Since 1983 India’s
entire S-band spectrum has been at the disposal of the DOS.’

§2) In 1997, the Cabinet of Ministers of the Republic of India approved a new policy
framework for satellite communications (“SatCom Policy”). Among other things,

ISRO Background Note, Exh. C-047, p. 1.

the SatCom Policy contemplated “[e]ncouraging the private sector investment in
the space industry in India and attracting foreign investments”.® In 2000, the
Government then approved the Guidelines and Procedures for the
Implementation of the SatCom Policy. The guidelines allowed the DOS to allocate
the spectrum capacity for commercial use on the basis of “suitable transparent
procedures”, such as “auction, good faith negotiations, first come first served, or
any other equitable method”.®

53. In 2003, the DOS transferred 40 MHz of S-band spectrum to the Department of
Telecommunications (“DOT”) for use for commercial terrestrial services.!° The
DOS retained the remaining 150 MHz, out of which 80 MHz were approved for
use by Broadcast Satellite Services ("BSS”) and the other 70 MHz were allotted
to Mobile Satellite Services (“MSS”)."' The following chart, which is excerpted
from the Memorial (para. 37), describes the resulting allocation of S-band:

B. THE DEVAS PROJECT

54. In mid-2003, a US consultancy firm named Forge Advisors, which would later
found Devas, began negotiations with the Indian Space Authorities on a potential
collaboration for commercializing some of the DOS’s S-band spectrum. In
particular, Forge Advisors proposed establishing a hybrid (satellite-terrestrial)
communications platform, which would offer two principal services: (i) an

interactive audio visual service that would deliver television and cable
programming to hand-held and mobile terminals, and (ii) a broadband wireless
access (“BWA’) service that would provide internet access to fixed (homes) and
nomadic users (PCs, laptops, tablets and mobile devices) in urban areas (the
Devas Services).'? In addition, the proposal contemplated a “rural information
kiosk receiver” to offer informational services to India’s rural population.'*

55. India instructed a committee comprised of public officials led by
Dr. K. N. Shankara, the Director of ISRO’s Space Applications Centre, to review
the feasibility of the Devas project. In May 2004, the committee issued a report
(the “Shankara Report’), which concluded that the concept was “attractive” and
provided for a “significant opportunity to ISRO and Antrix in the development of a
new, state-of-the-art satellite application and technology as well as in the broader
participation in the international commercial satellite market”.*

Cc. THE LEASE AGREEMENT

1. Negotiating history

56. In July 2004, based on the Shankara Report, the Board of Directors of Antrix
approved that the company enter into a partnership with Forge Advisors.'® At the
time, Antrix’s Board was composed of, inter alia, Dr. Nair, the Secretary of the
DOS and Chairman of the Space Commission, ISRO and Antrix, and Mr. Das,
Financial Advisor to the Government and a Member of the Space Commission
and the Atomic Commission.

57. In the course of the negotiations of the Agreement throughout the fall of 2004,
ISRO and Antrix, on the one hand, and Forge Advisors, on the other, exchanged

a number of communications, in particular:

e In mid-September 2004, Forge Advisors sent ISRO and Antrix a draft term
sheet which contemplated that ISRO would be a party to the Agreement

and would have the burden of obtaining an operating license from the
Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing of the DOT (“WPC License”).'°

Both of these proposals were rejected by ISRO and Antrix.'7

° The term sheet proposed by Forge Advisors precluded ISRO from
terminating the Agreement except for non-payment of fees by Devas."* If
ISRO terminated the Agreement for any reason other than Devas’s non-
payment, the term sheet provided that ISRO would refund to Devas all of
the amounts paid and would in addition pay liquidated damages of INR
460 million or INR 6.9 billion depending on the stage at which the
Agreement would be terminated.'? This proposal was also rejected by
ISRO and Antrix.?°

° A draft of the Agreement submitted by Forge Advisors on 6 December
2004 provided that “[i]n the case of material breach, in addition to
termination and refund of fees, the terminating party reserves the
customary rights and remedies provided by Indian law against the
defaulting party”.2' Antrix deleted this clause from the draft agreement on
13 December 2004.22

58. Following the negotiations, the Board of Directors of Antrix approved the final
version of the Agreement. On 17 December 2004, Devas was incorporated in the
State of Karnataka for the purpose of entering into the Agreement with Antrix.2°

2. Overview of the Agreement

59. On 28 January 2005, Antrix and Devas entered into the Agreement. The
Agreement provided for the lease of S-band capacity on two satellites, PS-1 (also
known as GSAT-6) and PS-2 (also known as GSAT-6A) to be manufactured and

launched by ISRO. The total amount of S-band capacity leased to Devas was
70 MHz, out of which 60 MHz were of BSS spectrum and the remaining 10 MHz
were of MSS spectrum (the “Devas Spectrum’). The following chart, excerpted
from the Memorial (para. 56), indicates the location of the Devas Spectrum:

60. Devas undertook to pay (i) an upfront capacity reservation fee of USD 20 million
per satellite to be paid in installments; (ii) lease fees in the amount of
USD 9 million per year to be increased to USD 11.25 million once Devas became

cash positive; and (iii) critical component acquisition fees.7°

61. The initial period of the lease was 12 years. The Parties later agreed to an
amendment providing for 12 further years upon the payment of a “reasonable
Lease Fee”.?” :

62. — Pursuant to its Article 27, the Agreement would take effect “on the date that Antrix
is in receipt of all required approvals and communicates to Devas in writing
regarding the same”. On 2 February 2006, Antrix sent a letter to Devas informing
that it had received “necessary approval for building, launching, and leasing the
capacity of S-band satellite”,2® which brought the Agreement into effect.?°

3. Terms governing the regulatory approvals

63. The Agreement included the following provisions allocating the burden of
obtaining regulatory approvals:

e Pursuant to Article 3(c), Antrix would be “responsible for obtaining all
necessary Governmental and Regulatory Approvals relating to orbital slot
and frequency clearances, and funding for the satellite to facilitate Devas
services, Further, Antrix shall provide appropriate technical assistance to
Devas on a best effort basis for obtaining required operating licenses and
Regulatory Approvals from various ministries so as to deliver Devas
services via satellite and terrestrial networks. However the cost of

obtaining such approvals shall be borne by Devas”.

° Further, under Article 12(a)(ii), Antrix, through ISRO/DOS, would be
“responsible for obtaining clearances from National and International
agencies (WPC, ITU, etc.) for use of the orbital slot and frequency
resources so as to ensure that the spacecraft is operated meeting its
technical characteristics and provide the Leased Capacity as specified”.

e Finally, according to Article 12(b)(vii), Devas would be “solely responsible
for securing and obtaining all licenses and approval (Statutory or
otherwise) for the delivery of Devas Services via satellite and terrestrial

network”.

4. Terms governing termination and exclusion of liability

64. With respect to contract termination and exclusion of liability, the Parties refer
particularly to Article 7(c), according to which Antrix “may terminate this
Agreement in the event Antrix is unable to obtain the necessary frequency and
orbital slot coordination required for operating PS1 on or before the completion
of the Pre Shipment Review of the PS1. In the event of such termination, Antrix
shall immediately reimburse to Devas all the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees
and corresponding service taxes received by Antrix until that date. Upon such
termination, neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other Party
under this Agreement nor be liable to pay any sum as compensation or damages
(by whatever name called)”.

A. DT’s INVOLVEMENT IN DEVAS

66. In October 2007, Devas’s representative, Dr. Rajendra Singh, first approached
Mr. Hamid Akhavan, then CEO of T-Mobile International AG, a DT subsidiary, to
discuss a possible partnership.*° By that time, Devas had already secured equity
investment from Columbia Capital LLC and Telecom Ventures LLC, who had both

invested in Devas through their Mauritian subsidiaries.

67. The Claimant submits that the Devas project matched DT’s strategy to invest in
early-stage players in emerging markets to which it could add value through its
expertise in planning and designing terrestrial networks.*' DT thus undertook a
review of Devas’s business plan and financial model.5? From late 2007 to early
2008, DT’s representative, Dr. Kim Larsen (one of the Claimant's witnesses in
this arbitration), worked with Devas to review Devas's business plan and financial
model.*° Additionally, in December 2007, Devas organized several meetings

between DT and the representatives of the Indian Space Authorities on ISRO’s

premises in Bangalore.

68. On 19 February 2008, DT’s Management Board discussed the prospects of
investing in Devas. The Board considered such investment to be in line with DT's
business strategy, but identified risks, such as the start-up nature of the business,
the unclear status of the WPC License and the limited nature of DT’s corporate
governance rights.*4 To minimize the risks, the Management Board approved an
initial equity investment of USD 75 million instead of USD 150 million as

previously contemplated.*>

69. On 19 March 2008, DT’s wholly-owned Singaporean subsidiary Deutsche
Telekom Asia Pte Ltd (“DT Asia”) signed a share subscription agreement with
Devas.** The agreement contemplated that DT Asia would acquire Class C
Shares in Devas in exchange of a USD 75 million equity contribution. On
18 August 2008, DT Asia closed the share purchase by paying the agreed
USD 75 million and acquiring 28,349 Class C shares in Devas, i.e. 17.2% of

Devas’s paid up share capital.°”

70. | On29 September 2009, following approval by DT’s supervisory board,°* DT Asia
agreed to make a further equity contribution in Devas in the amount of
USD 22.2 million.2® Consequently, DT Asia acquired further 8,400 Class C
shares in Devas and increased its shareholding to 20.73% of Devas's paid up
share capital.4° Following subsequent minor changes in Devas’s shareholding,
DT Asia’s shareholding decreased to 19.62%.4"

B. THE PURPORTED TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT

71. The Parties diverge on India’s motives for the cancellation of the Agreement. The
Claimant contends that India illegally repudiated the Agreement for commercial
reasons, as well as political considerations arising out of corruption allegations
(not involving Devas) against the Indian Space Authorities. The Respondent, on
the other hand, submits that it instructed Antrix to terminate the Agreement for
reasons linked to the country’s essential security interests. In this regard, the

following facts emerge from the record.

72. In April 2004, the Indian naval forces requested a satellite for naval use because
of a need for “reliable, secure, real time and uninterrupted tactical as well as
strategic communications”.‘? Similarly, throughout the period between 2005 and
2007, several public officials, including senior military officers, stressed the
importance of a reliable space-based communication network and recommended

reserving S-band for military and strategic purposes.**

73. In September 2007, the Expert Committee on Spectrum and Satellite Uses of
S-band by Defense Services, composed of officials of the Ministry of Defense
(“MOD”), issued a report concluding that if S-band were “lost to commercial
operators, it would severely jeopardize the future Defence services plans of
providing mobile SATCOM connectivity”. The report “strongly recommended that
the S-band spectrum be safeguarded from being poached by the commercial
operators for meeting the future requirements of Defence Services”.** At that
time, Antrix had already leased 70 MHz of S-band to Devas.

74. In December 2009, representatives of the MOD, Integrated Defense Staff (“IDS”),
Integrated Space Cell and ISRO held a meeting, at which the armed forces
requested 17.5 MHz of S-Band until 2010, 40 additional MHz for the upcoming
5-year term, and further 50 MHz for the subsequent 5-years.*°

75. — In parallel during 2009, allegations surfaced in Indian media that the DOS and in
particular Minister Raja had engaged in corrupt dealings in the context of the
allocations of 2G spectrum to terrestrial mobile operators (the “2G Scandal”). On
22 October 2009, the Indian Central Bureau of Investigations raided the offices
of the DOS.4° The 2G Scandal is unrelated to the allocation of S-band leased to
Devas. However, the Parties diverge on whether the bad publicity resulting from
the 2G Scandal and ensuing press allegations against the Government and
Devas played a role in the Government's eventual decision to annul the
Agreement.

76. | On8 November 2009, the Joint Secretary of the DOS, Mr. Vijay Anand (one of
the Respondent's witnesses in this arbitration), allegedly received a complaint
that the S-band spectrum had also been leased to Devas on the basis of corrupt
practices.*” The complaint was anonymous, apparently not in writing and not
submitted in evidence. On 8 December 2009, representatives of the Indian Space
Authorities met to discuss the complaint, as a result of which a single-man
committee consisting of the Director of the Indian Institute of Space and
Technology, Dr. Suresh (the “Suresh Committee”) was constituted.48

77. The Suresh Committee issued its report on 6 June 2010 (the “Suresh Report”).
The report stressed that there was “absolutely no doubt on the technical
soundness” of the Devas System. It also highlighted that, as a result of the
Agreement, only 10% of the capacity was available to ISRO, which would bring
“limitations on the availability of the spectrum for any essential demands in the
future”.4° The Suresh Report recommended that the Agreement be “re-visited”.°°

78. — In mid-May 2010, the DOT licensed 20 MHz of S-Band spectrum to commercial
Government-owned BWA operators as a result of an auction, which raised
USD 15 billion.*' This sparked increased interest from the media for the fact that

about 5 years earlier, 70 MHz of S-band had been leased to Devas at what the
media considered a low price.*? The media thus called upon the Government to

annul the Agreement in order to “raise some more much-needed money”.®°

79. On 14 June 2010, the DOT forwarded the press articles concerning the Devas
Agreement to the DOS Secretary Radhakrishnan for comments.* Two days later,
Secretary Radhakrishnan reacted by sending two memoranda, one to the DOT
and another one to the Ministry of Law and Justice (“MOJ”),®* in which he sought
advice as to whether the Agreement needed to “be annulled [...] in order to
(i) preserve the precious S band spectrum for the strategic requirements of the
nation and (ii) to ensure a level playing field for the other services providers using
terrestrial spectrum”.°”

80. The MOdJ replied on 18 June 2010 that the Government's duty was to take care
of strategic needs and not “to provide orbit slot to ANTRIX for commercial
activities, especially when there is [sic] strategic requirements”.°® It added that
the Government “may take a policy decision to the effect that due to the needs of
strategic requirements, the [Government] would not be able to provide orbit slot
in S band for operating PS1”.5°

81. | Having received such advice, Secretary Radhakrishnan instructed the DOS
Additional Secretary Balachandran to prepare a note on the annulment of the
Agreement for the upcoming meeting of the Space Commission.® On 30 June

2010, Mr. Balachandran issued a note attaching the Suresh Report®' and

recommended the annulment of the Devas Agreement in the following terms:
“Considering the need (i) to preserve S-band spectrum for national
requirements in strategic sector and for societal applications, (ii) certain
concerns on technical, managerial, financial and contractual aspects of
ANTRIX-Devas Agreement, and (iii) issues involved in DEVAS obtaining the
Spectrum License for the proposed services [...] it would be inevitable to annul
the ANTRIX/Devas Agreement”.®?

82. Atits 117" meeting, on 2 July 2010, the Space Commission considered that note
and found, inter alia, that “[gliven the limited availability of S band spectrum,
meeting the strategic and societal needs is of higher priority than
commercial/entertainment sectors”. Apart from the strategic and societal needs,
the Space Commission also referred to the concerns about “technical,
managerial and financial aspects” of the Agreement, including “severe penalty
clauses for delayed delivery” and observed that the estimated revenue from the
Devas Project did not justify the costs of the DOS investment in the satellites and
the cost of capital. In conclusion, the Space Commission decided that the DOS
“may take actions necessary and instruct Antrix to annul the Antrix-Devas
Agreement’.® It is undisputed that this decision was not communicated to Devas

at this juncture.

83. — After the meeting, Secretary Radhakrishnan sought advice from the Additional
Solicitor General (“ASG”) on how to annul the Agreement with the least legal
risks.°4 On 12 July 2010, the ASG advised that Article 7(c) of the Agreement
allowed Antrix to terminate the Agreement if it were “unable to obtain the
necessary frequency and orbital slot coordination required for operating PS1 on
or before the completion of the Pre-Shipment Review of PS1”. According to the
ASG, “the conditions stipulated in this clause cannot be invoked at this stage for
the purpose of terminating the contract”. The ASG further advised that Article
11(a) of the Agreement allowed Antrix to terminate the Agreement in the event of
force majeure, which included “acts of or failure to act by any governmental

authority acting in its sovereign capacity’. The ASG thus recommended that the
Government take a decision to terminate the Agreement “as a matter of policy, in

exercise of its executive power”.

84. On 9 January 2011, the Additional Secretary of the DOS, Mr. Balachandran,
prepared a further report based on the Suresh Report. That report noted that the
Government did not have complete information about the Devas Agreement at
the time of its conclusion and that the Agreement did “not leave enough spectrum
for ISRO/DOS use if required”.®°

85. A few weeks later on 2 February 2011, former Minister of Telecommunications
Raja and two other officials were arrested in connection with the 2G Scandal.®”
This triggered criticism from the opposition, including in connection with the
Government's allocation of the S-Band spectrum to Devas at an allegedly low

price.®®

86. A few days after the arrest, on 8 February 2011, Secretary Radhakrishnan and
Dr. Kasturirangan, a former ISRO Chairman and the DOS Secretary, announced
at a press conference the decision to terminate the Devas Agreement. They also
stated that there was no “finality” as to how the termination would be effected. On
this occasion, Devas learned for the first time about the purported termination of

the Agreement.

87. To proceed to the termination, Secretary Radhakrishnan instructed the DOS to
prepare a note for the Cabinet Committee on Security (“CCS”), which would take
the final decision,°® being the highest authority in such matters.

88. In the meantime, on 10 February 2011, the Prime Minister constituted a High
Power Review Committee to revise the decision to enter into the Agreement (the
“Chaturvedi Committee”).”°

89. On 16 February 2011, Secretary Radhakrishnan finalized the note for the CCS,
which suggested that there was “an imminent need to preserve the S band
spectrum for vital strategic and societal applications’.”’ The MOD commented on
the note that “[t]he Defence Services have extensive existing as well as planned
usages in [S-Band]”.’2

90. Onthe same day of 16 February 2011, the Prime Minister announced at a press
conference that the Government “should take a sovereign policy decision
regarding the utilization of [S-band] spectrum having regard to the country’s
strategic requirements” and that his office had sought not to “dilute, in any way
the decision taken by the Space Commission in July 2010”. According to the
Prime Minister, the matter was “expected to be put before Cabinet Committee on
Security for its final decision”.’°

91. One day later, based on Secretary Radhakrishnan’s note, the CCS made a final
decision that “[i]n light of the policy of not providing orbit slot in S Band to Antrix
for commercial activities, the Agreement [...] shall be annulled forthwith”.”4

92. Consequently, on 25 February 2011, Antrix notified Devas of the termination of
the Agreement due to a force majeure event, by reference to the decision of the
CCS.”* In addition to force majeure under Article 11(a) of the Agreement, the
letter relied on Antrix’s inability to obtain the necessary frequency and orbital slot

clearance as a ground for the termination pursuant to Article 7(c) of the

Agreement.

93. Devas responded three days later that (i) the purported termination of the
Agreement was not in good faith and that Antrix could not rely on a self-induced
force majeure; (ii) Antrix had already confirmed on 26 February 2006 that it had
obtained the necessary orbital slot clearances and, hence, Article 7(c) could not
serve as a valid ground for termination.’®

94. On 15 April 2011, Antrix offered to reimburse Devas for capacity reservation fees

paid,”” which Devas refused.

95. On15 May 2012, DT then notified the Prime Minister of the existence of a dispute
arising out of alleged breaches of the BIT.’® More than six months later, on
19 December 2012, the DOS responded that the notice of dispute was premature
since the contractual dispute between Devas and Antrix was ongoing.”?

96. On 15 February 2013, DT wrote again to the Prime Minister, repeating its desire
to engage in amicable negotiations.®° On 21 March 2013, the DOS responded
that there was no investment dispute between the Parties.*"

Cc. POST-ANNULMENT EXCHANGES AND ATTEMPTS TO SETTLE

97. The Parties diverge on the significance of their respective conduct and
communications after the purported termination of the Devas Agreement. For the
Claimant, the Respondent's subsequent conduct demonstrates that India did not
annul the Agreement on the basis of security needs, but rather for commercial
and political reasons. The Respondent, for its part, denies this allegation and
points to the fact that it attempted to compensate Devas pursuant to the terms of
the Agreement. The record establishes the following facts.

98. The Chaturvedi Committee issued its report on 12 March 2011. The report
concluded that the satellite services would be “especially useful for societal
applications, in natural disasters and communications in far-flung areas of the
country where building towers for terrestrial communications may be difficult”. For
the Chaturvedi Committee “[i]ts usage for strategic purposes by Defence forces
could also be developed”.*? Although the report criticized certain commercial
terms of the Devas Agreement, it concluded that “concerns regarding spectrum
having been sold [leased] cheap under the agreement have no basis

whatsoever”.®

99. On 12 April 2011, Cabinet Secretary Chadrasekhar submitted his
recommendations to the Prime Minister. He stated that the policy to reserve
S-band “for national and strategic purposes [...] may not realize the full
commercial potential of the S-band’. The recommendation warned that
“ISRO/DOS are left with a satellite [...] which has no immediate commercial

application”.64

100. Subsequently, on 17 May 2013, the Prime Minister's advisor proposed to free
80MHz of S-band for commercial use by terrestrial 4G services.® Finally, on
1 April 2015, the Cabinet of Ministers denominated S-band as “Defence Band
and Defence Interest Zone”.%

D. THE ICC ARBITRATION

101. Meanwhile, on 19 June 2011, Devas had commenced an ICC arbitration against
Antrix pursuant to Article 20 of the Agreement, requesting specific performance
or, in the alternative, damages of approximately USD 1.6 billion. The seat of the
arbitration was Delhi. Antrix initially refused to participate in the arbitration. In

August 2012, it initiated litigation in India to enjoin the arbitral proceedings. The

Supreme Court of India dismissed Antrix’s plea on 29 August 2013, after which
Antrix announced its intention to take part in the arbitration.

102. The ICC tribunal, composed of Dr. Adrsh Sein Anand, Dr. Michael Pryles and
Mr. V. V. Veeder QC, issued a final award on 14 September 2015 (the “ICC
Award”). The operative part of the ICC Award reads as follows:

“401 . For the foregoing reasons the tribunal unanimously finds and awards
as follows:

a. the tribunal has jurisdiction to hear and decide the claims in this arbitration;

b. Antrix is to pay USD 562.5 million to Devas for damages caused by Antrix's
wrongful repudiation of the Devas Agreement;

c. Antrix is to pay simple interest on USD 562.5 million from 25 February 2011
to the date of this award at the rate of three month USD LIBOR + 4%;

d. Antrix is to pay simple interest at the rate of 18% per annum of the amounts
in paragraphs 401(b) and (c) from the date of this award to the date of full
payment; and

e. each party is to bear its own legal costs of this arbitration, and the parties
are to pay, in equal shares, the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the
ICC administrative expenses.

402. All other claims and requests made by the parties in this arbitration have
been rejected”.®”

103. The ICC tribunal concluded that neither Article 7(c) nor Article 11(a) authorized
Antrix to terminate the Devas Agreement in the circumstances. Antrix filed an
action for annulment of the ICC Award before the Indian courts.®*

Iv. PRELIMINARY MATTERS

104. Prior to considering the merits of the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal will address
(1) the scope of this Award; (2) the applicable laws; (3) the relevance of the ICC
Award; and (4) a number of outstanding requests from the Parties.

1. Scope of the Award

105. In PO1, the Tribunal decided “to bifurcate the proceedings into a first phase
addressing jurisdiction and liability and a second phase addressing damages’”.*?
Therefore, the present award finally resolves all matters of jurisdiction and liability

without addressing quantum.

2. Applicable laws
a. Law governing the arbitration proceedings

106. Inthe Terms of Appointment signed on 3 June 2014, the Parties agreed on the
law governing the procedure of this arbitration as follows:
“40. In order of priority, the procedure in this arbitration shall be governed by
the mandatory provisions of the law of the seat on international arbitration,

these Terms of Appointment, the rules on procedure contained in Article 9 of
the BIT and the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

41. If the provisions therein do not address a specific procedural issue, the
applicable procedural issue shall be determined by agreement between the
Parties or, in the absence of such agreement, by the Arbitral Tribunal’.°°
107. Under Article 6(1) of the Terms of Appointment, the Parties agreed to set the seat
of this arbitration in Geneva, Switzerland, with the result that this arbitration is
subject to Chapter 12 of the Swiss Private International Law Act.

b. Law governing jurisdiction

108. It is common ground between the Parties that jurisdiction must be established
under the BIT. Specifically, the BIT’s dispute resolution clause contained in Article
9 reads as follows:

“(1) Any dispute between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party in connection with an investment in the territory of the other
Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably through
negotiations between the parties to the dispute. The party intending to resolve
such dispute through negotiations shall give notice to the other of its
intentions.

(2) If the dispute cannot be thus resolved as provided in paragraph 1 of this
Article within six months from the date of notice given thereunder, then the
dispute may be referred to conciliation in accordance with the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law Rules on Conciliation, 1980, if both
parties agree. If either party does not agree to conciliation or if conciliation

fails, either party may refer such dispute to arbitration in accordance with the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Rules on Arbitration,
1976, subject to the following provisions:

(a) in respect of conciliation proceedings, there shall be two conciliators,
one each appointed by the respective parties;

(b) in respect of arbitration proceedings, the following shall apply:

(i) The arbitral tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each party shall select
an arbitrator. These two arbitrators shall appoint by mutual agreement a
Chairman who shall be a national of a third State which has diplomatic
relations with the Governments of the parties to the dispute. The arbitrators
shall be appointed within two months from the date on which one of the parties
to the dispute informs the other of its intention to submit the dispute to
arbitration;

(ii) The arbitral award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, the relevant national laws including the rules on the conflict of
laws of the Contracting Party where the investment dispute arises as well as
the generally recognised principles of international law;

(iii) If the necessary appointments are not made within the period specified in
paragraph (2) (b) (i), either party may, in the absence of any other agreement,
request the Secretary General of the International Centre for the Settlement
of Investment Disputes to make the necessary appointments;

(iv) The tribunal shall reach its decision by a majority of votes;

(v) The decision of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding and the parties
shall abide by and comply with the terms of its award. The award shall be
enforced in accordance with national laws of the Contracting Party where the
investment has been made;

(vi) The arbitral tribunal shall state the basis of its decision and state reasons
upon the request of either party;

(vii) Each party concerned shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator and its
tepresentation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman in
discharging his arbitral function and the remaining costs of the tribunal shall
be borne equally by the parties concerned. The tribunal may, however, in its
decision direct that a higher proportion of costs shall be borne by one of the
two parties, and this award shall be binding on both parties;

(viii) During conciliation or arbitration proceedings or the enforcement of an
award, the Contracting Party involved in the dispute shall not raise the
objection that the investor of the other Contracting Party has received
compensation under an insurance contract in respect of all or part of the
damage. In this case the other Contracting Party will respect the award made
in the arbitration or conciliation proceedings and shall not initiate fresh
proceedings for the same matter as covered in the award”.%

109. It is uncontroversial that the interpretation of the BIT is governed by customary
international law as codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of
23 May 1969 ("VCLT"). It is also common ground that the Tribunal has the power
to rule on its own jurisdiction.°2

c. Law governing the merits of the dispute

110. Finally, in respect of the law applicable to the merits, the BIT contains the
following provision (Article 9.2(b)(ii):
“The arbitral award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, the relevant national laws including the rules on the conflict of
laws of the Contracting Party where the investment dispute arises as well as
the generally recognised principles of international law”.°>
111. Therefore, in addition to the BIT, the Tribunal will apply Indian national law and
generally recognized principles of international law whenever appropriate. Where
necessary, it will determine whether an issue is subject to national or international
law depending on the nature of the issue.

d. Jura novit arbiter

112. When applying the governing law, be it international or national, the Tribunal is
not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. Under the
maxim jura novit curia — or, better, jura novit arbiter — the Tribunal is required to
apply the law of its own motion, provided it seeks the Parties’ views if it intends
to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties

could not reasonably anticipate.°°

investments shall, subject to this Agreement, be governed by the laws in force in the
territory of the Contracting Party in which such investments are made”. The Parties have
not referred to this provision in the relevant section of the Terms of Appointment.

3. Relevance of the ICC Award

113. The Parties rely on different factual and legal findings of the ICC Award. The
Claimant submits that “whilst the ICC Award does not constitute res judicata as
regards the legal issues before this Tribunal [...], it should be considered as
authoritative on issues of contractual interpretation (it is the forum agreed by the
contracting parties to resolve disputes as to the meaning of the Agreement) and
highly persuasive on the issues of fact”.° The Respondent does not specifically
oppose the invocation of the ICC Award, but notes that “Antrix has announced
that it is in the process of preparing an application in appropriate court to set aside

the award” °”

114. The Tribunal notes that none of the Parties contends that the ICC Award has res
judicata effect for purposes of this arbitration and rightly so. Indeed, the Tribunal’s
mandate is to resolve a treaty dispute involving the State as a respondent, which
dispute is distinct from the contractual dispute brought before the ICC tribunal.
That being said, the Parties also agree that the ICC arbitration was the forum
chosen by Devas and Antrix to decide “any dispute or difference between the
Parties [Devas and Antrix] as to any clause or provision of this Agreement or as
to the Interpretation thereof [...]’.°° Hence, if issues in connection with the
interpretation, performance, or termination of the Devas Agreement arise in the
context of the resolution of the treaty dispute, the Tribunal considers that subject
to a compelling reason to the contrary, it should accord deference to the findings
of the ICC tribunal, being the forum entrusted with the settlement of contract

disputes.

4. Outstanding matters

115. In a letter dated 24 October 2016, the Respondent brought to the Tribunal's
attention “certain recent developments in the Devas matter’, including the filing
by India’s Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) of criminal charges against a
number of Government officials, Devas and certain of Devas’ officers and
directors. According to the Respondent, these criminal charges “if upheld, would

constitute additional grounds for dismissal [of the claims], as the alleged
investment will not have been made in accordance with Indian law’. The
Respondent further “note[d] that the filing of such charges would warrant
suspension of these proceedings pending resolution of the charges, as important
issues of public policy are implicated”. Together with its letter, the Respondent
submitted an additional legal authority (App. 3) and two factual exhibits, one of
which is described as “Charge Sheet No. 01/2016 [...] in the Honorable Court of
the Principal Special Judge for CBI Cases, dispatched on 11 August 2016”
(App. 1) (the “CBI Charge Sheet’).

116. In its reply of 14 November 2016, the Claimant argued that it was too late and
improper for the Respondent to (i) advance a new jurisdictional objection of
alleged “illegality” based on the CBI Charge Sheet; (ii) seek a suspension of the
arbitration pending resolution of the CBI charges; and (iii) unilaterally file new
factual evidence without seeking leave from the Tribunal. In this latter respect,
the Claimant asked the Tribunal to reject the Respondent's submissions and
requests and decline the admission of the documents submitted by the
Respondent.

117. Inits letter of 20 February 2017, the Tribunal denied the Respondent's request to
stay these proceedings and deferred its determination on the Parties’ other
requests in relation to the CBI charges to its forthcoming Award.

118. The Tribunal first notes that it is not clear whether, in its letter of 24 October 2016,
the Respondent sought to raise a new jurisdictional or admissibility objection
based on an alleged illegality in the making of the investment. To the extent that
this was the case, the Tribunal finds that such objection is untimely and contrary
to the procedural calendar established in this arbitration. Indeed, such purported
objection was raised well after the Parties’ written submissions and the Hearing.
The Tribunal likewise denies the introduction of new evidence into the record, as
untimely and not in accordance with the procedural rules, which require prior

leave.9?

119. In any event, even if the illegality objection were deemed timely, the Tribunal
would deny it on its merits. Indeed, the Respondent has not sufficiently
substantiated its objection, if it was one. It only devoted a few sentences in its

letter of 24 October 2016 arguing that, if upheld, the criminal charges in question
would be grounds for dismissal of the claims, as the investment would not have
been made in conformity with Indian law. Second, and more importantly, the CBI
Charge Sheet on which the Respondent relies was issued in the context of an
investigation commenced by the CBI in March 2015 and contains mere
allegations that have not yet been tried, let alone upheld, in court. Third, none of
the allegations contained in the CBI Charge Sheet relate to actions or conduct of
DT. The Respondent has not explained how, as a result of the CBI Charge Sheet,
DTs investment (made through the acquisition of shares in Devas) would have
been contrary to Indian law. For all of these reasons, the Tribunal cannot follow
the Respondent's argument that the claims should be dismissed for reasons of
illegality.

Vv. PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS

120. The Respondent has raised three preliminary objections or “threshold issues’,
which in its view preclude the Claimant from bringing this arbitration. First, it
argues that the BIT does not cover indirect investment and indirect investors (A).
Second, it asserts that the Treaty does not protect pre-investments (B). Third,
India puts forward that the Treaty does not apply as a consequence of the
invocation of the “essential security interest’ clause contained in Article 12 (C).

A. INDIRECT INVESTMENT AND INDIRECT INVESTOR

121. The Parties diverge on whether the BIT covers indirect investments by indirect
investors, such as shares in the local company held through an interposed
subsidiary.

4: The Respondent’s position

122. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae
“because indirect investors are not protected under the [BIT]’.*™ It is undisputed
that DT does not directly own the shares in Devas. Rather, the shares are owned
by DT Asia, DT’s wholly-owned Singaporean subsidiary. According to the
Respondent, even if Devas's activities were considered to be an investment
within the meaning of the BIT, DT does not qualify as an investor and, hence, its

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 93 of 258

claims fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In support, the Respondent relies on

four main arguments.

123. First, the text of the BIT is unequivocal in requiring the investment to be directly
made by the investor. Article 1(b) of the BIT defines “investment” as “every kind
of asset invested in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Party
where the investment is made”, while Article 2 limits the scope of the BIT to
“investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the
other Contracting Party”."°' Yet, DT has made no investment in the territory of
India, since DT owns no assets in India. It is DT Asia which owns the shares in
Devas.

124. The Respondent refutes the Claimant's argument that the definition of investment
is broad enough to extend to indirect investments. It asserts that the breadth of
the definition of investment “goes to the type of rights or assets that are afforded
protection, not to the manner in which such rights or assets are held”.

125. Second, for the Respondent, Articles 1 and 2 seen in conjunction with Article 5(3)
of the BIT reinforce the conclusion that indirect investments are not covered by
the Treaty. In particular, Article 5(3) is designed to give standing to the
shareholders of an expropriated company to bring an expropriation claim in the
following terms:

“Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company in its
own territory, in which investors of the other Contracting Party own
shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
Article are applied in the same manner to provide compensation in
respect of the Investment of such investors of the other Contracting
Party who are owners of those shares”.1°°

126. According to the Respondent, such provision, which grants standing only to the
investors who own shares, “would not have been necessary if, as the Claimant
argues, indirect investors are covered by the [Treaty]’.1°

127. Third, the analysis of German and Indian “comparative treaty practice [...] leads
to the conclusion in this case that indirect investments are beyond the scope of
the [BIT]’.1°° The Respondent invokes the treaty practice of the contracting states
as a recognized supplementary method of treaty interpretation under the
VCLT." It relies, inter alia, on the following treaties concluded by India and
Germany:

e India-UK: “This Agreement shall apply to any investment made by
investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party including an indirect investment made through another
company, wherever located, which is fully owned by such investors,
whether made before or after the coming into force of this Agreement”.°”

e India-France: “This Agreement shall apply to any investment made by
investors of either Contracting Party in the area of the other Contracting
Party, including an indirect investment made through another company,
wherever located, which is owned to an extent of at least 51 per cent by
such investors, whether made before or after the coming into force of this
Agreement”.1°°

e India-Spain: “This Agreement shall apply to any investments made by
investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party, in accordance with its laws and regulations, including
an indirect investment made through another company, whenever [sic]
located, which is fully owned by such investors, whether made before or
after the coming into force of this Agreement”.

e Germany-Mexico: “The term ‘investments’ means every kind of asset
acquired or used directly or indirectly in order to achieve an economic

objective or other management objectives”.

128. In support of its position, the Respondent cites to Zachary Douglas, according to
whom the absence of the words “directly or indirectly” implies “directly”:
“The principle verba aliquid operari debent as a canon of treaty interpretation
requires that effect be given to the expansive terms ‘directly or indirectly’ so
that treaties with this stipulation can be meaningfully distinguished from
treaties without it. [...] [A] great number of investment treaties do not contain
a provision of the type under consideration and hence there must be a
concomitant limitation upon the tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae: the
claimant must exercise effective control directly over the investment”.1!9
129. Inthis regard, the Respondent also relies on Berschader v. Russia. |n interpreting
the Belgium-USSR BIT, that tribunal noted that the definitions in certain other
treaties “expressly provide for protection of investments ‘owned or controlled
directly or indirectly’ by the party concerned”. From the absence of such wording
in the Belgium-USSR BIT, it concluded as follows:
“[S]uch contrasting approaches do render it unlikely that, in the absence of
specific evidence to the contrary, both Contracting Parties intended that the
Treaty would encompass the kind of indirect investments relied upon [by] the
Claimants. It would seem likely that if the Contracting Parties had so intended,
they would have expressly provided protection for such indirect investments
in the terms of the Treaty...”114
130. Thus, given that the Germany-India BIT does not extend to indirect investments
and indirect investors, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal decline

jurisdiction.

2s The Claimant’s position

131. The Claimant refutes the Respondent's objection concerning the indirect nature
of the investment with the following main arguments.

132. First, according to the Claimant, nothing in the BIT’s definition of investment
supports India’s argument that only investments made directly were intended to
qualify for Treaty protection. Article 1(b) of the BIT “contains a characteristically
broad definition of investment encompassing ‘every kind of asset invested’”.1'5
The absence of the explicit reference to “indirect” investments cannot be
interpreted as a requirement that there be no interposed companies between the
investment and the ultimate owner of the company.

133. In support, the Claimant makes reference to numerous arbitral decisions.11® For
instance, it points to Siemens v. Argentina. There, the tribunal construing the
Germany-Argentina BIT, which contains language similar to the BIT at hand,
accepted jurisdiction based on the indirect nature of the investment.” As to
Berschader v. Russia relied upon by the Respondent, the Claimant notes that the
decision to decline jurisdiction was based on language of the Belgium-USSR BIT,
which extended its scope of application to “indirect investments made by
investors of one of the Contracting Parties in the territory of the other Contracting
Party by the intermediary of an investor of a third state”. The tribunal considered
this language to exclude indirect investments made through a subsidiary
established in the same state as the claimant. The reasoning of the Berschader

tribunal cannot thus be transposed to the present case.

134. Second, the Claimant refutes the Respondent's argument that Article 2 of the BIT
rules out indirect investments, because it requires the investments to be made “in
the territory” of the host state. For DT, its investments “such as direct contribution
of substantial manpower, know-how and expertise, as well as shares and
interests in Devas and its assets, were ultimately made ‘in the territory of India’.
The only relevant question “is whether these investments must be made directly
‘in the territory of India in order to qualify for protection”.1'® Article 2 of the BIT
does not require that no companies be interposed between the investor and the
investments, which are located in the territory of the host state. According to the
Claimant, investment tribunals have consistently refused to consider references
to investments made “in the territory” as a requirement that such investments be

made directly.1"9

135. Third, the Claimant submits that Article 5(3) of the BIT, which provides for
compensation of the shareholders of an expropriated company does not require
that the shares be owned directly. In EURAM v. Slovak Republic, the tribunal held
that Article 4(3) of the Austria-Slovak Republic BIT, which contains language
similar to Article 5(3) of the Germany-India BIT, did not warrant “a narrower
interpretation” of the definition of investment.'?? Moreover, as explained by the
Siemens tribunal, a provision such as Article 5(3) defines the damage that can
be recovered and “who may base the claim” on such damage.'?' Therefore,
Article 5(3) may not serve to restrict the broad definition of investment found in
Article 1(b) of the BIT.

136. Finally, the Claimant opposes the Respondent's reliance on the treaty practices
of India and Germany. According to the Claimant, investment tribunals have been
unpersuaded by the invocation of this supplemental method of treaty
interpretation. In ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, for instance, the tribunal

dismissed the argument that indirect investments were excluded from treaty
protections because the definition of investment in the applicable treaty contained
no specification in this respect when other treaties had express wording. It noted
that “different formulations may have precisely the same effect”.'2? Similarly, the
silence of the BIT about the direct or indirect nature of the investment should not
be understood as a limitation to direct investments.

3. Analysis

137. The Respondent's objection concerning the indirect nature of the Claimant's
investment essentially raises the following questions: (a) whether the BIT
requires the national of the home state to hold the relevant assets directly,
ie. without interposed companies, as a consequence of the BIT’s definitions of
“investment” or “investor”; and (b) whether the home state national who does not
directly own the assets affected by the contested measures can claim for Treaty
breaches as a result of those measures. The Tribunal will address each of these

questions in turn.

a. Does the BIT require the home state national to hold the assets
directly?
138. Article 1(b) of the BIT contains a broad definition of investment, which starts as
follows:

“Investment’ means every kind of asset invested in accordance with the
national laws of the Contracting Party where the investment is made [...].”

139. The provision then continues with a non-exhaustive list of assets that may qualify
as investments. This includes “shares in, and stock and debentures of, a

company, and any other forms of such interests in a company”.

140. The Respondent does not dispute that under Article 1(b) of the BIT broad
categories of assets can qualify as investments. It contends, however, that “the
breadth of the definition of ‘investment’ goes to the type of rights or assets that
are afforded protection by a treaty, not to the manner in which such rights or
assets are held”.'”° The Tribunal agrees. For an asset to qualify as an investment

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 99 of 258

under Article 1(b), it does not suffice that it falls within one of the categories of
the non-exhaustive list. Article 1(b) also requires that the relevant assets be
“invested in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Party”. In other
words, the BIT specifies how the investment must be made. Thus, even if an
asset pertains to one of the listed categories (e.g. stock in a company), it will not
qualify as an investment unless it is “invested in accordance with the national
laws of the [host state]’.

141. That being said, the Tribunal fails to discern a requirement of direct ownership in
the language of Article 1(b) of the BIT. The provision requires that the relevant
asset be “invested”. It does not specify, however, that it must be invested directly,
that is without one or more intermediate companies. In the absence of any
qualifying language in the BIT as to the indirect or direct nature of investments,
the Tribunal will interpret the terms “investment” and “invested” according to
Article 31(1) of the VCLT, taking into account ordinary meaning, context and
object and purpose of the Treaty.

142. Investments are often made indirectly. It is indeed not unusual for investors to
structure their foreign investments through several corporations for a variety of
legal and regulatory reasons. India itself notes as much, when it suggests that
DT may have made its investment through the Singaporean subsidiary due to the
favorable double taxation regime between India and Singapore. 14 Therefore, the
ordinary meaning of the terms “investment” or “invested” is not restricted to assets

which an investor owns directly.

143. The object and the purpose of the Treaty do not justify a limitation to directly
invested assets. The preamble of the BIT provides that the Contracting Parties
aim at “creating conditions favourable for fostering greater investment” and
“stimulation of individual business initiative” that “will increase prosperity in both
States’. Such objectives can be achieved irrespective of whether an investor
carries out its economic activities directly, by holding title to each and every

relevant asset, or indirectly, through subsidiaries.

144. The interpretation reached through Article 31(1) of the VCLT, according to which
the term “investment” does not rule out indirect investment absent an express

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 100 of 258

limitation, is corroborated by consistent decisions of a number of investment
tribunals.'?° In Guaracachi v. Bolivia, for instance, the tribunal construed an
unqualified definition of “investment” contained in the UK-Bolivia BIT to “naturally
include ‘indirect investments’ through the acquisition of shares in a company”.
Similarly, in Siemens v. Argentina, the tribunal held that “a literal reading” of the
unqualified definition of “investment” in the Argentina-Germany BIT “does not
support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect
investments”.126

145. It is true that Berschader v. Russia held that an indirect investment was outside
the scope of the Belgium-USSR BIT. However, it did so on the basis of treaty
language providing that “[t]he term ‘investment’ also means indirect investments
made by investors of one of the Contracting Parties in the territory of the other
Contracting Party by the intermediary of an investor of a third state”.12”7 The
tribunal accordingly held that indirect investments made through companies in
the home state itself, as opposed to a third state, were not protected.

146. The Respondent further invokes differences in language used by the investment
treaties concluded by Germany and India. It suggests that the lack of an express
specification in the Treaty means that the BIT only covers direct investments. The
Tribunal cannot follow this argumentation. As it is clear from the authorities cited
by India, comparative treaty practice can only serve as supplementary means of
treaty interpretation.'2® In application of the primary means, the Tribunal has
concluded that indirect investments qualify for treaty protection. It is thus
unnecessary to resort to the comparative treaty practice.

147. In any event, the fact that India and Germany chose not to elaborate on the
directness of investments in the BIT does not mean that they intended to exclude

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 101 of 258

indirect investments. As noted in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela in relation to
comparative treaty practice, “there is no single way of drafting definitions”.!?°
Some treaties are more detailed than others. Some may for instance specify the
components of fair and equitable treatment and others may not do so. This does
not imply that the latter exclude those components from the notion of fair and
equitable treatment. The Respondent has not advanced the travaux of this
particular Treaty, showing that the Treaty’s silence should be interpreted as an

exclusion.

148. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Treaty definition of “investment” does
not require that assets be held directly by the national of the home state in order
for them to qualify as protected investments.

149. Should any different conclusion be drawn from the Treaty definition of ‘investor’?
Article 1(c) of the BIT defines the term “investor” as “nationals or companies of a
Contracting Party who have effected or are effecting an investment in the territory
of the other Contracting Party”. Thus, in order for a national or company of the
home state to be considered an investor, first, it must have “effected” or be
“effecting” an investment and, second, such investment must be “in the territory
of the [host state]”.

150. The first part of the definition does not require that the investment be “effected”
directly. India has not argued that the ordinary meaning of the word “effected”
implies that the investment be structured without intermediate companies. As
noted above, in practice investments are often “effected” indirectly.

151. The second part of Article 1(c) of the BIT requires the investment to be “in the
territory” of the host state. It is common ground that Devas is a company
incorporated and existing in India. In the Tribunal’s view, the requirement that the
investment be in the territory of the host state does not restrict the way in which
such investment can be made. It suffices that the result of the investment activity,

i.e. relevant assets, be in the territory of the host state.

152. Investment tribunals have consistently refused to read into the reference to the
territory of the host state a requirement for direct ownership of the assets

constituting the investment. For instance, the CEMEX v. Venezuela tribunal
stated:
“[Whhen the BIT mentions investments made ‘in’ the territory of a Contracting
Party, all it requires is that the investment itself be situated in that territory. It
does not imply that those investments must be ‘directly’ made in such
territory.”"9°
153. It therefore suffices that the assets invested be situated in India. It is not
necessary that the assets be owned directly by DT in order for the latter to qualify
as an investor.

b. Can an investor claim for the measures affecting indirectly held
assets?

154. The present question - whether a protected investor can claim for measures
affecting its indirectly held investment - is distinct from the definition of
“investment” and “investor”. The fact that certain assets qualify as investments
and that a given national who indirectly holds these assets qualifies as investor
does not necessarily mean that such national can assert the direct owner's rights
over the investment. The Respondent is correct in underscoring that Article 5(3)
of the BIT contains a specific rule in this regard. The provision reads as follows:

“Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company in its own
territory, in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall
ensure that the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article are applied in
the same manner to provide compensation in respect of the Investment of
such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.”

155. The Respondent submits that this rule grants direct shareholders “standing to
bring an expropriation claim” with the result that indirect shareholders would lack
such standing." In the Tribunal’s view, this submission is unsupported by the
language of Article 5(3) of the BIT. The provision is clear in that it obliges the host
state to fulfill one of the substantive obligations under the BIT vis-a-vis the direct
shareholders, namely the obligation to compensate for a taking of the assets of
the subsidiary. The rule does not address standing or whether a shareholder can
present claims for violation of substantive provisions of the Treaty with respect to
its indirect investment. The Respondent itself acknowledges this when, in respect

of its pre-investment defense (addressed below), it argues that Article 5(3) does
not “purport to address non-expropriation claims”. Indeed, Article 5(3) does not
provide who has standing to claim for breaches other than expropriation. It merely
establishes that a shareholder can benefit from the expropriation prohibition

otherwise owed to the subsidiary.

156. Here, the Claimant does not present itself as the beneficiary of the protections
owed to its subsidiaries. It does not purport to step into the shoes of its
subsidiaries in order to assert any of their rights deriving from the primary norms
of the Treaty. Instead, it claims for the reflective loss that it itself suffered due to
India’s alleged breaches of Treaty obligations protecting DT’s investments. India
does not dispute that, under international investment law, shareholders are
entitled to recover the reflective loss that they suffer from the violation of the
applicable treaty standards with respect to their investments. This is not the issue
dealt with in Article 5(3); that provision covers a different situation and allows a
shareholder to benefit from the BIT’s protection towards the subsidiary.
Therefore, it cannot be read to restrict the shareholder's distinct right to claim on
its own behalf for the reflective loss that it suffered.

157. For the above reasons, the Tribunal denies the Respondent's preliminary
objection based on the indirect nature of the Claimant's investment.

B. PRE-INVESTMENT

A The Respondent’s position

158. The Respondent submits that the Germany-India BIT is a typical “admission
clause model treaty”. It protects investments only once established and thus pre-
investment activities fall outside its ambit. India cites a number of authors to argue
that the rationale behind excluding pre-investment activities from the scope of an
investment treaty is to “allow the host state to retain control over the entry of
foreign capital, to screen investments to ensure their compatibility with the state’s
national security, economic development, and public policy goals, and to
determine the conditions under which foreign investments will be permitted, if at

all’ 192

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 104 of 258

159. According to the Respondent, the Claimant's argument that Article 3(1) of the BIT
provides for the obligation to admit investments “is refuted by the unanimous
precedents and writings on the subject that such language is the hallmark of an
‘admission clause’ model treaty”.° To oppose the Claimant’s argument that
Article 3(1) of the BIT only requires the investment to be made legally in order to
be admitted for protection, the Respondent contends that (i) the “in accordance
with” provisions similar to Article 3(1) of the BIT are normally interpreted to create
an admission requirement and (ii) in any event, even if the language “only
incorporated the concept of legality”, the record shows that “Devas lacked the
intellectual property rights that it represented it had in the Devas Agreement, and
[...] DT was fully aware of that fact”.1°4

160. The Respondent draws attention to various decisions which declined jurisdiction
on the ground of the pre-investment nature of the claimants’ activities. In
particular, the Respondent relies on the following cases:

e In Mihaly v. Sri Lanka, the claimant incurred significant expenses in
obtaining financing, negotiating project documents, conducting feasibility
studies, but the Government eventually refused the construction project.
The tribunal declined jurisdiction highlighting “the absence of the consent
of the host state to the implementation of the project”.12°

e In Nagel v. Czech Republic, although the claimant entered into a legally
binding cooperation agreement with a state-owned company and a
private operator to jointly seek licenses to operate a global system of
mobile communications (GSM), and although the claimant “might have
been encouraged by various remarks from Ministers or Government
officials or by general interests they demonstrated in his plans’, the
tribunal considered that the claimant had carried out pre-investment

activities because “[t]here was not, and could not be, a guarantee that a
license would in fact be obtained”.19°

e In Zhinvali v. Georgia, the claimant entered into a memorandum of
understanding, later supplemented by heads of agreement, with a private
company, which held the lease for a power plant. The project
contemplated the rehabilitation of the power plant. Upon the request of
the claimant, the Government provided a letter pledging that the claimant
could “expect support from the Government” in a number of areas,
including regulatory permitting. During a nine-month period, in which the
Government undertook not to contract with a third party, the claimant
incurred substantial expenses in the preparation for the project. Georgia
ultimately did not proceed, because the World Bank insisted on the
organization of a transparent and competitive bidding process. The
tribunal considered that the claimant's activities had not gone beyond the
pre-investment stage and declined jurisdiction.19”

161. Like in these cases, the Claimant's activities in India remained at a pre-
investment stage, says India, since the Claimant never obtained the necessary
governmental approvals. Indeed, Devas never applied for, let alone obtained, the
WPC License, which was indispensable for the terrestrial re-use of the leased
spectrum. Without this license, “Devas could not engage in any business, even a
satellite only business” .1°6

162. In the Respondent's further submission, the fact that DT Asia had established a
local subsidiary for the implementation of the project is irrelevant for purposes of
the pre-investment analysis.%° The shares in Devas are not a relevant
investment, since “[t]}he Government has not expropriated Devas shares or
otherwise prevented the Devas shareholders from managing the company” .*4°

local subsidiary does not alter the fact that “Devas could not roll out the Devas
Services after the decision of the Cabinet Committee on Security’.141 In this
sense, the formation of the local company “is only another step in the pre-
investment activity”."42

163. The Respondent opposes the argument that Article 5(3) of the BIT permits the
shareholders to claim compensation for the expropriation of the assets of the
company. According to India, (i) the Claimant cannot resort to Article 5(3) since it
owns shares in a Singaporean company not an Indian company; (ii) Article 5(3)
does not “purport to address non-expropriation claims’; and (iii) in any event, the
Claimant “confuses the concept of who is entitled to claim compensation for an
alleged expropriation with the concept of whether there is an ‘investment’ affected
by measures of the host state in the first instance”."4°

164. Equally irrelevant, so says India, is DT’s reference to the funds and resources it
contributed to Devas. Those investments are paradigmatic development or
“getting ready” activities, which are outside the protection of the BIT. In any event,
the Government has not expropriated these contributions. In fact, upon the
termination of the Devas Agreement, Antrix offered to refund the upfront capacity
reservation fees paid by Devas. 44

165, In sum, what matters for India in the context of the pre-investment objection is
that “the approvals indispensable for the project were not obtained, that without
them the project could not proceed, and that neither Devas nor Claimant had a
‘contractual right’ or ‘concrete assurance’ to obtain those approvals”.14° The
present dispute thus arises out of pre-investment activities over which the

Tribunal has no jurisdiction.

2. The Claimant’s position

166. The Claimant opposes the Respondent's argument that the BIT is an “admission
clause” treaty. The text of the Treaty does not condition the protection of an
investment on its admission by the host state. Instead, Article 3(1) of the BIT

imposes an obligation on each contracting party to “admit investments in its
territory in accordance with its laws and policy”. Furthermore, Article 1(c) of the
BIT defines “investors” as “nationals or companies of a Contracting Party who

have effected or are effecting investments” (emphasis added).

167. In any event, so contends DT, even if the BIT only applied to admitted
investments, the Indian authorities, including the Foreign Investment Protection
Board (“FIPB”) and the DOT expressly admitted DT’s investments. '#° This fact
distinguishes the present case from the ones cited by the Respondent. For
instance, in Mihaly v. Sri Lanka, the tribunal emphasized the absence of an
“acceptance by the host State ... of such expenditures as constituting an
investment”.‘4” Similarly, in Zhinvali v. Georgia, the tribunal underscored the lack
of any express or implied consent to receive or admit the investment.'4®

168. Furthermore, according to the Claimant, in none of the cases to which India refers
in support of its pre-investment defense did the claimants have any other
investments on which the tribunal's jurisdiction could have been founded."4° By
contrast, DT has made multiple investments in India, including the shareholding
in Devas, the rights under the Agreement, and investments in kind reflected in
the contributions of capital, know-how and other resources. DT addresses these
assets in turn.

169. First, the Claimant opposes India’s submission that the shares in Devas are not
a relevant investment because the contested measures did not affect the shares
or the rights of the shareholders. No such “relevance” requirement exists.
Moreover, “DT does claim indirect expropriation of its shareholding and other

investments and, for purposes of assessing jurisdiction, the Tribunal may not

assess the merits of that claim”."°°

170. In any event, according to DT, the measures impugned do not need to directly
impact the shares for jurisdiction to be established. Numerous investment
tribunals have recognized the “direct right of action of shareholders”, which
entitles shareholders to bring claims arising out of measures affecting the
company.'®! This right is confirmed by Article 5(3) of the BIT, which gives the
shareholders of a local company the right to claim compensation for the

expropriation of the assets of the company. 12

171. Second, the Claimant asserts that Devas’s rights under the Agreement also
constitute an investment being “right[s] to money or to any performance under
contract having a financial value” under Article 1(b)(iii) of the BIT. Those rights
became binding and enforceable upon Antrix’s notification of February 2006,
which brought the Agreement into effect. The rights to lease satellite spectrum
unquestionably had financial value, as evidenced by DT’s valuation of the
investment opportunity in Devas,*® by criticism in the Indian media that Antrix
had “leased valuable spectrum at an undervalue’,’® and by India’s internal

discussions.

172. For the Claimant, the fact that Devas has not obtained the WPC License does
not change the qualification of the contract rights as investments. DT is not
claiming that the Agreement gave it an acquired right to implement the Devas
Services or to obtain the necessary licenses. All DT needs to show is that it

acquired rights under the Agreement with financial value."*> The Agreement had
value irrespective of the licenses. The absence of licenses goes to the valuation
of Devas’ rights and is a matter for the damages phase.

173. Finally, the Claimant counters India’s argument that the activities which Devas
carried out before receiving the WPC License are pre-investment and argues that
such a view is belied by investment jurisprudence. If such argument were valid,
it would have barred jurisdiction in a number of cases, including for instance in
Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, where the termination of a mining concession gave
rise to a treaty claim although the investor had not obtained the final approval to
start mining.**° Thus, accepting the Respondent's pre-investment defense would
have “far-reaching consequences” as it would “unduly limit treaty protection for
investments that are effected in stages or are subject to multiple stages of
governmental approval’.'®” For all these reasons, the Claimant submits that this
jurisdictional objection must be denied.

3. Analysis
174. Article 3(1) of the BIT reads as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favorable conditions for
Investors of the other Contracting Party and also admit investments in its
territory in accordance with its law and policy”.

175. The Respondent submits that this provision subjects the application of the Treaty
to the host state’s admission of an investment. The Tribunal does not share this
view. The wording of Article 3(1) is unequivocal: it establishes an obligation
pursuant to which “[e]ach Contracting Party shall [...] admit investments in its
territory in accordance with its law and policy”. Article 3(1) is not a permissive
clause authorizing the Contracting States not to admit investments; it stipulates
an obligation of admission subject to the law and policy of the host state. That
provision says nothing about the consequences of a lack of admission; it certainly
does not imply that Treaty protection depends on admission.

176. The authorities invoked by India do not suggest otherwise. Jeswald Salacuse
writes that “if a treaty protects only investments made in accordance with host
country law and an investment in an arbitration case is shown not to have been
made in accordance with such law, a tribunal may conclude that it has no
jurisdiction to hear the dispute”.'®* This, however, relates to the requirement of
legality of an investment and must be distinguished from an admission
prerequisite. The Respondent does not raise illegality as a separate defense. *°
It states, however, that “Devas lacked the intellectual property rights that it
represented it had in the Devas Agreement, and [...] DT was fully aware of that
fact”.'®° India relies on the response of the Devas group to the due diligence
questionnaire from 29 December 2007, which shows that the group answered
“N/A” (not applicable) to the questions on intellectual property. The Tribunal
cannot infer from this evidence that Devas did not hold the intellectual property
rights at stake. The Respondent did not further elaborate its allegation made for
the first time in the Rejoinder and chose not to address this issue at the Hearing.

177. Even if it were established that Devas misinformed Antrix with respect to one of
the contractual conditions (quod non), it is doubtful that this would make DT’s
investment illegal or could be a ground for invalidity of the Devas Agreement. In
any event, it is telling that Antrix did not raise the invalidity of the Agreement in
the ICC Arbitration on this basis. In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot but

dismiss India’s argument that DT’s investment was illegal.

178. Moreover, even if the Tribunal were to accept that Article 3(1) of the BIT is a
permissive clause authorizing the host state not to admit investments (quod non),
the record shows that India’s Foreign Investment Protection Board and the DOT
approved DT’s indirect equity participation in Devas.'*' The Tribunal agrees with
the Respondent that the shares in Devas should not necessarily be viewed as an
investment in isolation of the activities carried out by the company. This is not the

case here. It is undisputed that DT contributed substantial financial resources,
i.e. over USD 97 million, to obtain its indirect shareholding in Devas. Those equity
contributions are protected investments under Article 1(b)(ii) of the BIT.
Furthermore, by endorsing DT’s participation in Devas, India admitted the
Claimant's investment.

179. The Respondent insists that Devas has not obtained the WPC License, which
was crucial to roll out the Devas System. While this is factually correct, the
Treaty’s definition of “investment” is not restricted to going concerns holding all
the relevant authorizations to carry out their business. If the Treaty applied only
to businesses with all necessary permits and licenses, it would for instance leave
out a valid concession contract until the concessionaire obtained the last
authorization to commence its activity. Such restrictive interpretation would not
be warranted in light of the text and the object and purpose of the Treaty.

180. The absence of the WPC License may have made DT'’s investment less valuable
and may thus have an impact on quantum. It does not, however, affect
jurisdiction.

181. In this context, the Tribunal stresses that the situation before it differs from the
cases relied upon by India. In Mihaly, the agreements entered into by the claimant
were non-binding;'® in Petrobart, the negotiations “did not result in any binding
undertakings in the Contract’;'® in Zhinvali, the “[nJegotiations... to conclude a
definitive set of agreements... never came to fruition”;1* in Nagel, the claimant
entered into a cooperation agreement “only of a preparatory nature”.’°° By
contrast, in the present case, Devas had a binding agreement contemplating the
lease of valuable satellite spectrum, which agreement became effective after
Antrix informed Devas that it had obtained full clearance from the Government to

proceed with the lease.

182. For these reasons, the Tribunal reject’s the Respondent's pre-investment

objection.
c. ESSENTIAL SECURITY INTERESTS
te The Respondent’s position

183. In sum, the Respondent invokes Article 12 of the BIT which excludes the
application of the BIT standards to measures in furtherance of the host state’s
essential security interests. India’s decision to reserve S-Band spectrum for
military and other strategic use is a quintessential policy decision. Therefore, by
virtue of Article 12 of the BIT, the Claimant is precluded from challenging this
measure under the BIT.

a. The deference owed by the Tribunal

184. The Respondent submits that, irrespective of whether Article 12 is “self-judging”
or not, the Tribunal must accord substantial deference to India’s national security
determinations and in particular to its decision to reserve S-band for military and
strategic use.'® It relies on the UNCTAD Report on the Protection of National
Security in International Investment Agreements (“UNCTAD Report’) to suggest
that “the distinction between self-judging and non-self-judging exceptions is more
subtle than it may appear at first sight” and that the essential security defense
“would lose its meaning and purpose if a third party had the power to impose on
a State that felt threatened its own view about whether such a threat actually
exists and what measures, if any, that State is allowed to take in response”.'% It
is “neither the expertise nor the responsibility of an international tribunal ... [to]
second-guess the appropriate national authorities in matters of national
security”. 1°

a6, See Counter-Memorial, paras. 50-56 (arguing that “substantial deference” or “a wide
measure of deference” must be granted to security determinations made by national
authorities).

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 113 of 258

185. According to India, the record shows that the decision to reserve S-band
spectrum for military and strategic use was taken following extensive
consultations with the entire national security hierarchy of India; more specifically:

° In October 2005, the IDS requested that the DOT block bandwidth in
S-band."

e In September 2007, the Expert Committee on Spectrum and Satellite
Uses of S-band warned that if the spectrum “is lost to commercial
operators, it would severely jeopardize the future Defense services plans
of providing mobile SATCOM connectivity”.*”°

. On 2 July 2010, India’s National Security Advisor warned that S-band was
“crucial for several strategic and societal services”.'7'

e On 15 February 2011, the MOD addressed the DOS stating that “the
barest minimum requirement” of S-band spectrum for the defense
services was 120MHz.‘72

° On 17 February 2011, the Cabinet Committee on Security, India’s highest
authority on security matters, decided to reserve S-band for non-
commercial use, “having regard to the needs of the country’s strategic
requirements’ .175

° On 1 April 2015, the full Cabinet of Ministers placed the S-band within
India’s “Defence Band and Defence Interest Zone”.'”4

186. The Respondent refutes the Claimant's argument that the contested measure
was taken because of publicity-related political or commercial considerations.
This argument can only be accepted, so says the Respondent, if one concludes
that the Cabinet Committee on Security did not mean what it said and the entire

national security hierarchy of the country “engaged in a bad faith conspiracy to
reserve the space segment of S-band capacity for illegitimate reasons of ‘political
and commercial expediency”.'”° The standard of proving bad faith is high and
such allegations “should be supported not by disputable references but by clear
and convincing evidence”.'’° The Claimant's “strained inferences drawn from a
couple of newspaper articles” do not warrant second guessing the sovereign
determination of the Indian national security organs.

b. India’s measures as “prohibition” or “restriction”

187. India refutes DT’s argument that Article 12 requires a “prohibition” or “restriction”
implying a measure of general application. A “prohibition” or “restriction” within
the meaning of Article 12 need not necessarily apply to a large number of persons
or entities. The CCS decision leaves no doubt that it did reflect a broader policy
of spectrum usage, when it stated that “the Government will not be able to provide
orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities”.'”” The fact that, at the time
of the CCS decision, the Agreement with Devas was the only existing contract for
the commercial use of the spectrum does not mean that the decision to reserve
the spectrum for strategic use was not a general policy determination.

188. The Respondent opposes the Claimant's argument that the CCS decision did not
affect the commercial use of the S-band spectrum by two Government-owned
terrestrial operators. The spectrum of 40MHz allocated to those operators in 2003
“was not available to meet the strategic requirements for S-Band spectrum and
could not be used efficiently even if it could eventually be coordinated for such

use”.178

189. According to the Respondent, there is no merit either in the Claimant's
submission that the CCS decision was not a final policy decision as it has been
“perennially revisited”. The fact that different opinions were voiced within the
Government as to the potential of reassigning the spectrum for commercial use
does not mean that the decision has been revisited. Far from that, the full Cabinet

of Ministers recently reconfirmed the CCS decision and denominated S-band as
“Defence Band and Defence Interest Zone”.1”°

c. No requirements of urgency and proportionality

190. Contrary to DT’s position, India submits that Article 12 of the BIT does not require
urgency for the application of the essential security interests defense. The
Claimant erroneously conflates Article 12 of the BIT with the customary
international law plea of necessity. In particular, the CMS and Sempra ad hoc
committees rejected this view. They considered that the essential security
interests clause in the Argentina-U.S. BIT excludes the application of the
substantive obligations of the treaty as a result of which there can be no breach
of the treaty if the clause applies. By contrast, the state of necessity contemplated
by Article 25 of the International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility
(‘ILC Articles”) is a circumstance precluding wrongfulness, which only comes into
play when there is a breach of a primary treaty obligation:

“Article XI [the ‘essential security interests’ provision of the U.S.-Argentina
BIT] is a threshold requirement: if it applies, the substantive obligations under
the Treaty do not apply. By contrast, Article 25 [of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility] is an excuse which is only relevant once it has been decided
that there has otherwise been a breach of those substantive obligations”."®°

191. Consequently, so argues the Respondent, the requirement of urgency applying
to the customary rule of state of necessity cannot be transposed to the BIT’s
essential security interests clause. Matters of defense pertain quintessentially to
national security. The CCS decision to reserve S-band for defense and strategic
use was a matter of national security in the short and long term, and the
Respondent is not required to show urgency or an imminent threat.

192. The Respondent also opposes the Claimant's argument that the term “necessary”
in Article 12 of the BIT implies that the contested measures must be proportionate
to or imperatively required for advancing the purported national security interests.

According to India, this argument of DT “boils down to the thesis that this Tribunal
should review and evaluate India’s defense and security needs and determine for
itself, and for India, the best way to ensure the nation’s security’.°* The
Claimant’s suggestion that less restrictive measures were available to achieve
the security goal pursued is again premised on a misplaced analogy with the
customary rule of state of necessity, and must therefore be discarded. In any
event, the less restrictive alternative measures that DT suggests are

meaningless:

° The 40 MHz spectrum allocated to terrestrial operators which DT puts
forward as an alternative cannot be used to satisfy military
requirements. ‘®? In any event, according to the 2013 report of the Indian
National Satellite System (“INSAT”), India’s defense requirements have
increased to 235.2 MHz."®

e Another alternative advanced by DT is that Devas could have provided
the services for the military. As explained by witness Mr. Sethuraman,
however, “India would not permit a commercial enterprise to operate its
defense and security transmissions”."°4

. The Claimant's contention that India failed to show why S-band spectrum
was essential is equally unconvincing. A sophisticated party like DT knows
that S-band is unique as it allows transmission by hand-held devices. ">
No other band except L-band, which is not available to India, is
comparable in this regard.'®

193. India further rejects DT’s submission that India’s measures did not contribute to
the protection of its essential security interests, as it made no use of S-band since
the annulment of the Agreement. Since the CCS decision in 2011, the first
satellite GSAT-6 was reconfigured for military use and was finally launched on 27
August 2015. This satellite, together with two others (GSAT-6A and GSAT-7S)

which have also been configured for military use are advancing India’s military
needs as determined by the military authorities, irrespective of the Claimant's

view. 187

194. Accordingly, so contends India, it has sufficiently established that it took the
contested measure in furtherance of the essential security interests. It need not
show that such interests were urgent nor that the measure was proportionate.

d. India’s alleged contribution to the spectrum scarcity

195. The Respondent denies that spectrum scarcity was its own creation. It cites to
Jeswald Salacuse to argue that the essential security interest clause is not limited
to situations to which the state has not contributed. '®*

196. India considers that the decisions related to the Argentine economic crisis which
the Claimant invokes are inapposite. In those cases, Argentina had contractual
commitments from which it sought to excuse itself as a result of the economic
crisis.

197. Moreover, the Claimant does not establish that India contributed to the creation
of the scarcity of S-Band spectrum required for essential security interests. In
particular, so argues the Respondent, DT’s argument that India should have
reserved S-band for military use from the outset instead of allocating it for
commercial use lacks merit. The concept of national security is not frozen in time
and nothing in the BIT “precludes a government from constantly assessing and

reassessing its security needs”.1®°

e. Article 12 excludes the obligation to compensate DT

198. Contrary to the Claimant's contention, the Respondent argues that Article 12 of
the BIT excludes the obligation to compensate DT. It relies, inter alia, on the CMS
annulment committee, which noted that “if and so long as [the essential security
interests clause] applied, it excluded the operation of the substantive provisions

of the BIT. That being so, there could be no possibility of compensation being
payable during that period”.19°

199. Inthe Respondent's opinion, DT’s submission that Article 5(1) of the BIT requires
compensation even if the expropriation is for a public purpose is ill-founded,
because the Respondent does not rely on a defense of public purpose under
Article 5, but on Article 12, which excludes “the operation of the substantive
provisions of the BIT".

200. The Claimant's reliance on EDF is also inapposite. While assessing Argentina's
state of necessity defense, the EDF tribunal stated that “at some reasonable point
in time, Respondent should have compensated Claimant for injury suffered as a
result of measures enacted during any arguable period of necessity’.1°? This
finding cannot apply to the present case. India relies on the treaty provision about
essential security interests, which, as explained above, substantially differs from
the defense of state of necessity. Awarding compensation where the essential
security interests clause applies would deprive that BIT provision of any effect.

201. For all these reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to defer to India’s
policy decision to reserve S-band for non-commercial use and to refrain from
assessing the compliance of this measure with the substantive provisions of the
BIT, the application of which is excluded pursuant to Article 12 of the BIT.

2. The Claimant’s position

202. It is the Claimant's position that India failed “to discharge the burden of proving
that the annulment of the Agreement was necessary to protect India’s essential

security interests”.'°

a. No substantial deference owed by the Tribunal

203. The Claimant submits that the Respondent's argument according to which the
Tribunal must accord “substantial deference” or a “margin of appreciation” to India
when determining whether its measure was necessary to protect essential
security interests is unsupported by investment treaty case law and doctrine. Only
in Continental Casualty did the tribunal recognize a margin of appreciation based
on the specific language of the US-Argentina BIT, which refers to the state’s “own
essential security interests”. The tribunal put the emphasis on the word “own”,
which does not appear in the Germany-India BIT, with the result that the findings

in Continental Casualty are inapposite.

204. DT further relies on the UNCTAD Report in support of its position that the Tribunal
does not owe substantial deference to India, which report reads in relevant parts

as follows:

“It goes without saying that a non-self-judging exception clause would limit the
Contracting Parties’ sovereign right to protect their national security
considerably. It would give arbitral tribunals in such a critical area as national
security the right and duty to decree what a country is and is not allowed to
do. To some extent, IIA Contracting Parties would be putting their destiny into
the hands of arbitrators. The tribunal would make a final and binding judgment
as to whether or not the measures of the host country were actually necessary
to protect its national security.

Lo]

Under the above approach, arbitration tribunals would have the power to judge
whether the respective host country measure was indeed required to respond
to the threat, or whether there would have been less severe means with a
smaller impact on the investment. The approach would thus allow for a
proportionality test. This reduces the regulatory discretion of the Contracting
Parties considerably, but it also enhances legal clarity and predictability for
the foreign investor”.'%4

205. Moreover, according to DT, awards and annulment committee decisions are
unanimous in interpreting non-self-judging essential security interests clauses to
require an “objective, substantive review of whether the terms of that clause are

met”,125

206. Contrary to the Respondent's opinion, for DT, the Tribunal does not need to infer
bad faith in order to reject India’s essential security interests defense. This might
have been the case if Article 12 of the BIT contained a self-judging essential
security interests clause. According to the Claimant, none of the twelve publicly
available investment awards addressing non-self-judging essential security
interests clauses require a showing of bad faith. While the record may well show
that India failed to act in good faith, Article 12 does not require such a finding.'®°

b. No prohibition or restriction

207. The Claimant argues that the reference to “prohibition” or “restriction” in Article
12 of the BIT implies “a measure that has general application”. India’s targeted
action against the Agreement was not such a measure for the following reasons:

e The decision to annul the Agreement specifically targeted Devas. It was
taken much earlier than the CCS meeting on 17 February 2011. In fact, it
was the Space Commission which decided to get rid of the Agreement on
2 July 2010,197

e The CCS decision hardly qualifies as a final policy decision since it “has
perennially been revised and the Government departments continue to
argue over what use should be made of the S-band”.1°9

208. Therefore, for DT, India's decision to annul the Agreement does not come under

the exemption contained in Article 12 of the BIT.

Cc No emergency

209. The Claimant stresses that Article 12 applies to “essential security interests’,

which implies that there must be an imminent threat of severe consequences.

210. DT notes that the Argentine cases in which the investment tribunals resorted to
the essential security interests clause involved a national crisis, which in the
words of the Continental Casualty tribunal “brought about [...] the near-collapse
of the domestic economy; the soaring inflation; the leap in unemployment; the
social hardships bringing down more than half of the population below the poverty
line; the immediate threats to the health of young children, the sick and the most
vulnerable members of the population, the widespread unrest and disorders; the
real risk of insurrection and extreme political disturbances, the abrupt
resignations of successive Presidents and the collapse of the Government,
together with a partial breakdown of the political institutions and an extended

vacuum of power”,200

211. The LG&E tribunal also circumscribed necessity under the customary rule, which
—in DT’s submission - can assist the Tribunal in interpreting Article 12, as follows:
“an extremely serious threat to [the state’s] existence, its political and

economic survival, to the possibility of maintaining its essential services in
operation, and to the preservation of its internal peace”.?°"

212. Nothing of that sort can be drawn from India’s “vague assertion that military needs
‘crystalized’ in December 2009”, a fact that is in any event unsupported by

evidence. Nor do the “references to amorphous other ‘strategic’ and ‘societal’

needs” offer any help. Alleged needs such as “train-tracking” and “public utility
services” do not come close to “essential security interests” .2°

213. Furthermore, the Government “repeatedly acted contrary to MOD's claims for
spectrum, most notably approving GSAT-6A for commercial use just six weeks
before the military needs supposedly ‘crystallised’. Similarly, the Government
allowed Government-owned terrestrial operators to continue to use 40 MHz of
other S-band spectrum for commercial use. Moreover, India made no use of the
Devas Spectrum for five years since the Space Commission's decision to annul
the Agreement. For the Claimant, these facts demonstrate that India itself

neglected its now-alleged essential security interests.

214. In conclusion, according to DT, India “failed to plead, let alone prove, that there
was any ‘situation of emergency’ or any threat at all to India’s essential security
interests at the time the Government annulled the Agreement”.2°

d. No necessity and proportionality

215. In this context, the Claimant first asserts that the annulment of the Agreement
was not necessary to protect India’s essential security interests, nor was it
proportionate to that objective. It relies on the dictionary definition of the word
“necessary” pursuant to which such word denotes something that is
“indispensable, vital, essential” or “required” or “imperative”.2°4 Along the same
lines, the LG&E tribunal understood the word “necessary” to refer to “situations

in which a State has no choice but to act”.2°

216. The Claimant also looks to the object and purpose of the BIT, which is to create
conditions favorable for providing and protecting investments, and stimulating
private business initiative. Accordingly, the Claimant argues that the requirement
that the measure be necessary implies that no less restrictive measure be
available.

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 123 of 258

217. The Claimant further resorts to the customary international law rule of necessity
to provide guidance for the interpretation of Article 12 of the BIT. In particular, the
Commentary to the ILC Articles states that the plea of necessity ‘is excluded if
there are other (otherwise lawful) means available even if they may be more

costly or less convenient” .2°

218. In addition, the Claimant submits that India has failed to satisfy the requirements
of necessity and proportionality. First, India’s measures did not contribute to
protecting its essential security interests. The situation here is different from the
one in the Argentine cases. Indeed, had Argentina not taken the contested
measures, there was a threat of a widespread collapse of the Argentine economy.
Here, by contrast, had India refrained from annulling the Agreement, no such
consequence would have ensued. This is evidenced by the fact that India made
no use of the spectrum, in the five years following the annulment of the
Agreement.”

219. Second, so argues DT, India has failed to show that no less restrictive measures
existed. The Claimant mainly refers to the following alternative measures:

° The Government could have used other S-band spectrum, namely the
40 MHz allocated to the DOT;

° Devas could have provided services to the MOD through the Devas
System;
e The Government could have renegotiated the Agreement and taken back

some but not all the spectrum from Devas;

e The Government could have used other spectrums, such as C-band, Ku-
band, L-band, X-band or Ka-band;

° The frequency re-use technology could have allowed the Government to
multiply the capacity which it already had in order to satisfy the military
demand.?°°

220. It is thus the Claimant's submission that India has not established that the
annulment of the Agreement was necessary and proportionate to any essential

security interests.

e. India’s contribution to the alleged spectrum scarcity

221. The Claimant submits that India may not invoke Article 12 of the BIT, since it is
responsible for the spectrum scarcity on which it now relies as an excuse. In

support, DT relies on arbitral awards holding that a State may not benefit from an
essential security interests clause if it contributed to the creation of the situation,

to which it claims to be responding.

222. According to the Claimant, the Respondent was entirely responsible for the
alleged spectrum scarcity since instead of reserving the spectrum for military use
in 2005, it allocated (i) 70 MHz of S-band for commercial use to DOS, which was
subsequently leased to Devas and (ii) 40 MHz of S-band to Government-owned
operators for commercial use.2"?

fi: Duty to compensate irrespective of Article 12

223. The Claimant also submits that Article 12 of the BIT does not exclude the state’s
duty to compensate investors for the harm caused. It claims that such
interpretation is warranted by the context of the Treaty. Article 6 in particular
mandates compensation for “losses owing to war or other armed conflict, a state
of national emergency or civil disturbances’. Under the BIT, ‘liability and

in the interpretation of Article XI itself’. When interpreted in light of the above principles,

compensation are expressly mandated, not excused”.?"' In this regard, the
Claimant also invokes Article 5(1) of the BIT which requires compensation for

expropriation irrespective of a public purpose.

224. For DT, the customary international law defense of necessity offers further
guidance in this regard. Especially, “a successful plea of [...] necessity is ‘without
prejudice’ to ‘the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the
act in question’”.2'2 Thus, even if successful, India’s argument based on Article
12 of the BIT does not excuse it from the obligation to compensate the Claimant.

3. Analysis
a. Introductory remarks
225. Article 12 of the BIT reads as follows:

“Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent either Contracting Party from
applying prohibitions or restrictions to the extent necessary for the protection
of its essential security interests”.

226. According to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty “shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in
their context and in the light of its object and purpose”. The starting point of the
interpretation is the “ordinary meaning” of the text. The latter must be ascertained
in the light of the context and the treaty’s object and purpose, any subsequent
agreement or practice of the Contracting Parties related to the interpretation of
the treaty, and any other relevant rules of international law applicable in the
relations between the Contracting Parties.

227. Article 12 entitles a Contracting Party to take measures “to the extent necessary”
for the protection of its essential security interests without incurring responsibility
under the substantive provisions of the BIT otherwise providing protection to
investors. As held by the ad hoc committee in CMS v. Argentina in relation to the

similarly worded Article XI of the U.S.-Argentina BIT,?"° “if [the essential security
interests clause] applies, the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not
apply”.?"*

228. As a preliminary point, Article 12 must be distinguished from the customary
international law defense of state of necessity, which is codified in Article 25 of
the ILC Articles. As explained by the CMS ad hoc committee, the essential
security interest clause and the state of necessity defense are “substantively
different”; they are subject to different requirements and have “a different
operation and content”.2"® Thus, as further remarked by the ad hoc committee in
Sempra v. Argentina, “Article 25 cannot [...] be assumed to ‘define necessity and
the conditions for its operation’ for the purpose of interpreting Article XI” of the
U.S-Argentina BIT,2"°

229.  Thisis also true of Article 12 of the Germany-India BIT, which must be interpreted
on its own terms, without incorporating requirements from the customary
international law state of necessity defense which are not present in the text of
the Treaty. Thus, contrary to the Claimant’s view, the Tribunal does not consider
that Article 12 is limited to situations of “emergency”, or that the state must prove
that a measure is the “only one” available, or that it must not have contributed to

213 Article XI of the U.S.-Argentina BIT reads as follows: “This Treaty shall not preclude the
application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order,
the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of
international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests”.

the situation of necessity at issue.2"” In other words, the requirements under
Article 25 of the ILC Articles are stricter than those under Article 12 of the BIT. As
noted by one commentator, the possibility exists “that a state could meet the
requirements of a treaty exception clause and therefore be exempt from liability
under an investment treaty without satisfying the state of emergency

requirements envisioned by Article 25”.218

b. The requirements under Article 12 of the BIT

230. The Tribunal now turns to the requirements that must be fulfilled for an essential
security interest defense to succeed. Article 12 (quoted in full supra at para. 225)

provides for the following conditions:
(i) aContracting Party must apply a “prohibition[] or restriction{]’;
(ii) for the protection of a state’s “essential security interests”;

(i

 

‘to the extent necessary for” such protection.

231. Before examining whether India meets these conditions, the Tribunal addresses
the threshold question whether Article 12 is self-judging or not. India does not
argue that Article 12 is a self-judging clause, and rightly so. Clear indications in
the text of the treaty would be required in order to infer that a provision is self-
judging. Such indications are absent from Article 12.219 As the ICJ stated in
relation to a similarly worded exception clause, “by the terms of the Treaty itself,
whether a measure is necessary to protect the essential security interests of a

essential interest against a grave and imminent peril” and necessity may not be invoked

The Law Of Investment Treaties (Oxford University Press 2010), Exh. RLA-132, pp. 384-

party is not [...] purely a question for the subjective judgment of the party; the text
does not refer to what the party ‘considers necessary’ for that purpose”.2?° The
interpretation given by investment tribunals to Article XI of the U.S.-Argentina BIT

is to the same effect.221

232. With this in mind, the Tribunal will examine whether India’s act, i.e. the CCS
decision of 17 February 2011, qualifies as a “prohibition or restriction” which was

“necessary” to protect India’s “essential security interests”.

233. Starting from the first requirement (“prohibition” or “restriction”), the Tribunal is of
the view that nothing in the text of Article 12 requires a prohibition or restriction
to be general in nature, namely to affect a large number of persons or entities. As
aresult, it has no difficulty to consider that the disputed measure was a prohibition
and restriction in the sense that the CCS decision held that “the Government will
not be able to provide orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial use” and
consequently determined that the Devas Agreement needed to be annulled.
India’s measure thus fulfils this first requirement.

234. The assessment of the two other requirements (“essential security interests” and
“necessary”) is more complex. In this respect, India argues that its determinations
in matters of national security are owed “substantial deference” and that
“international tribunals should not second-guess national security determinations
made by national authorities, as the latter are uniquely positioned to determine
what constitutes a State’s essential security interests in any particular
circumstance and what measures should be adopted to safeguard those

interests” 222

235. In respect of the existence of essential security interests, the Tribunal accepts
that a degree of deference is owed to a state’s assessment. However, such

deference cannot be unlimited. In support of its argument, India cites to an ECtHR
decision in which the Court, in India’s words, “refused to accept the State's
contention that drug trafficking was a matter of national security, even though the
latter term does have a broad scope”.?%? In reality, the ECtHR held that the notion
of national security cannot be stretched “beyond its natural meaning”:
“the notion of ‘national security’ [...] may, indeed, be a very wide one, with a
large margin of appreciation left to the executive to determine what is in the
interests of that security. However, that does not mean that its limits may be
stretched beyond its natural meaning [...]. It can hardly be said, on any
reasonable definition of the term, that the acts alleged against the first
applicant — as grave as they may be, regard being had to the devastating
effects drugs have on people's lives — were capable of impinging on the
national security of Bulgaria or could serve as a sound factual basis for the
conclusion that, if not expelled, he would present a national security risk in the
future”.?24
236. To paraphrase the ECtHR judgment, the limits of essential security interests
contemplated in Article 12 cannot be stretched beyond their natural meaning. For
the Tribunal, the natural meaning of the treaty terms requires the presence of
interests concerned with security (as opposed to other public or societal interests)
that are “essential”, i.e. that go to the core (the “essence”) of state security. In
that sense, one may distinguish the “essential security interests” required for a
successful invocation of Article 12 from the requirement that an expropriation be
carried out in the public interest pursuant to Article 5(1) of the Treaty. Since Article
12 excludes all the obligations of the Treaty, including the obligation to provide
compensation for a lawful taking under Article 5, it must protect something of
higher value than any “public interest’.

237. As a third condition, Article 12 requires that the prohibition or restriction be
imposed only “to the extent necessary for’ the protection of such essential
security interests. In this respect, India suggests that national authorities are
“uniquely positioned to determine” (and the Tribunal may not “second-guess’)
“what measures should be adopted to safeguard those interests’.22° The

Respondent adds that while “it is [not] impossible to imagine a case of improper

assertion of an ‘essential security interests’ defence, [...] where the decision on
its face is obviously related to issues of defence and national security, the

‘essential security interests’ provision clearly applies”.226

238. For Article 12 to come into play, a prohibition or restriction must not simply be
“related to” essential security interests, but indeed must be “necessary for the
protection” of such interests. Whether a measure is “necessary” or imposed “to
the extent necessary” under Article 12 is subject to review by the Tribunal, as the
clause is not self-judging (see supra para. 231). In that review, the Tribunal will
undoubtedly recognize a margin of deference to the host state’s determination of
necessity, given the state’s proximity to the situation, expertise and competence.
Thus, the Tribunal would not review de novo the state’s determination nor adopt
a standard of necessity requiring the state to prove that the measure was the
“only way” to achieve the stated purpose. On the other hand, the deference owed
to the state cannot be unlimited, as otherwise unreasonable invocations of Article
12 would render the substantive protections contained in the Treaty wholly

nugatory.

239. To assess the necessity of the measures to safeguard the state's essential
security interests, the Tribunal will thus determine whether the measure was
principally targeted to protect the essential security interests at stake and was
objectively required in order to achieve that protection, taking into account
whether the state had reasonable alternatives, less in conflict or more compliant
with its international obligations.

c. Was the CCS decision necessary for the protection of India’s
essential security interests?

240. With those principles in mind, the Tribunal will now review the evidence to
determine whether the CCS decision to annul the Devas Agreement, was
“necessary for the protection of [India’s] essential security interests’. In
performing this review, the Tribunal cannot analyze the CCS decision in isolation;
it must assess the decision taking account of its background and must also
consider subsequent facts to the extent they may shed light on the purported
necessity of the measure for the protection of India’s essential security interests.

241. At the outset of its review of the evidence, the Tribunal observes that it did not
have the benefit of the testimony of those senior officials directly involved in the
process leading to the CCS decision, in particular Dr. Radhakrishnan, who was
since 2009 Chairman of the Space Commission, Chairman of ISRO, Secretary of
the DOS and, until July 2011, Chairman of Antrix; 22” or Mr. Balachandran,
Additional Secretary of the DOS in the relevant period; or Ms. Geeta Varadhan,
who appears to have liaised closely with the military in respect of the alleged
military needs. Neither did the Tribunal hear any testimony from officials of the
MOD. The witnesses whom India did put forward, Messrs. Sethuraman, Anand
and Hegde, while helpful in some respects, had either no personal knowledge or
only peripheral knowledge of many of the relevant events.278 The Tribunal’s
analysis is thus necessarily centered on the documentary evidence, which is
examined in some detail in the following paragraphs so as to put the CCS

decision in its proper context.

242. It is convenient to start with an examination of the military needs that allegedly
prompted the decision to annul the Devas Agreement. The Respondent is of
course correct that, during the years 2005-2009, military demands repeatedly
surfaced as to the S-band spectrum. The following facts are particularly important

in this respect:

a. In 2005-2006, the IDS urged that the DOT block bandwidth in S-band.?2°

er In respect of Dr. Radhakrishnan, it was suggested by India’s witnesses at the Hearing
that he was a “terribly busy person” (Anand, Transcript, Day 4,p. 20, line 16 — p.21, line
8) and “too senior [in] stature to travel for a long time outside” of India, despite being now
retired (Transcript Day 5, p.7, line, 11 - 18).

8 See Sethuraman (Transcript, Day 3, p. 56, line 19 - p. 64, line 11); Anand (Transcript,
Day 4, p. 9, line 13 - p. 20, line 13) and Hegde (Transcript, Day 5, p. 3, line 25 —p. 10,
line 7). Mr. Anand was not involved in discussions with the military until 2014 (Transcript,
p.4, line 11 /p.19, line 22).

en See Anand WS, Annex 1, App. VA-2, HQ Integrated Defence Staff, Note, 14 October
2005, Appendix H (stating that the projected bandwidth requirements of the Army, Navy
and Air Force in S-band were for 86 MHz by 2010, 151 MHz by 2015 and 208 MHz by
2020); Anand WS, Annex 1, App. VA-4, HQ Integrated Defence Staff Ops Branch/IW &

is inescapable necessity for continue of S-band [sic]. The total [bandwidth] contemplated
for S-band would be 86 MHz — 151 MHz — 208 MHz for short, medium & long term
respectively (extract from DSV-2020)”).

b. |n 2007, the “Expert Committee on Spectrum and Satellite Uses of Frequency Band
2.5 to 2.69 GHz (S-band) by Defence Services” stated that “[i]f this spectrum (2.5 —
2.69 GHz) is lost to commercial operators, it would severely jeopardize the future
Defence services plans of providing mobile SATCOM connectivity”; it thus “strongly
recommended that the ‘S’ band Spectrum be safeguarded from being poached by
the commercial operators for meeting the future requirements of the Defence
Services”, and concluded that “non availability of the Spectrum could stymie the
future operational plans of the Defence services”.”°°

c. In 2008, the military and ISRO then met for the purpose of determining how “the
scarce ‘S’ band spectrum should be optimally utilized”, with ISRO requesting “HQ
IDS to interact with respective service HQs and forward a consolidated proposal
regarding the same”.25"

243. In response to ISRO’s request to forward a “consolidated proposal” regarding the
optimal utilization of the “scarce” S-band spectrum, the military presented its
formulation of requirements for S-band at a meeting held on 15 December 2009
between the Integrated Space Cell of the IDS and ISRO.* It is worth looking
more closely at the unredacted version of the minutes of this meeting at which,
so the Respondent contends, India’s military needs “crystallized”.?°> The relevant
passage of the minutes reads as follows:

“7.'S’ Band.
(a) Requirement. The requirement of the ‘S’ Band is as follows:-

(i) To cater for requirements up to 2012 - 120 Carrier, 17.5 MHz. Out of which
50 Carriers are being used by the Armed Forces.

(ii) Additional in 12th Plan — 40 MHz.
(iii) Additional in 13th Plan —50 MHz.

(b) ISRO expressed their inability to provide any other carriers other than the
existing 50 Carriers in ‘S’ Band. When clarified by DACIDS [Deputy Assistant
Chief of Integrated Defence Staff], ISC [Integrated Space Cell], ISRO affirmed
that the Armed Forces were free to explore other avenues to make good the
shortfall. DACIDS, ISC directed Army to explore new avenues.

(c) ISRO also brought out that the existing BW is not being exploited fully. This
was objected to by the Army representatives. Though Armed Forces hire
additional BW to cater for operational requirements, in this case it was not so
and unlike in the past, today available spectrum is being exploited. It was
further brought out that problems were being faced by the user while using the
brief case terminals, Army has been interacting with BEL and DEAL to identify
the problems. A representative was required from ISRO also to analyse the
problems. This was agreed to by ISRO.

(d) In addition, Sci Secy ISRO, brought that the technology being used
currently is of older generation and newer methods have to be tried out. The
country has been allotted only 20 MHz for BSS and 15 MHz for MSS in S band
for the country and our solutions have to be fit in it. He also detailed various
options available in 'S' Band to overcome this limitation. He said that star
topology in multiple beam configuration with a master hub and a DR hub is
one of the most viable solution to meet the requirements. On query by Col P
Dikshit, Dir DSA, it was clarified that ISRO will give out the exact number of
simultaneous connections possible in that architecture.

(e) DACIDS, ISC brought out that, in view of Sci Secy, ISRO, statement,
pending launch of GSAT 7S, the services have to best utilise available 'S'
Band spectrum. Further, he directed that deeper analysis be carried out by
the army in consultation with ISRO and BEL and all necessary modifications
are to be included in the GSAT 7 S program without further delaying the
project”. (emphasis added)

244. It appears from these minutes that, in response to ISRO’s indication that
spectrum was limited, the IDS agreed “to explore new avenues’,?*4 accepted that
the IDS needed “to best utilise available S-band spectrum” and directed that
“deeper analysis be carried out by the army” once informed of the possibilities of
frequency re-use.?°> There is no suggestion in these minutes that military needs
were irreconcilable with the Devas Agreement. Moreover, the IDS position
appears to be that its existing demands may be satisfied by exploring future
avenues, and that its future requirements will be satisfied by GSAT-7S (as
modified following “deeper analysis” into frequency re-use). The Tribunal notes

that none of the attendees of this meeting — which included ten persons from
ISRO — was presented to testify.

245. The Tribunal further observes that no evidence was presented about the results
of the exploration of “other avenues” and the “deeper analysis” of the
modifications to GSAT-7S decided at the meeting just discussed. Nor is there any
evidence that the result of the military's “deeper analysis” was considered in the
decision to annul the Devas Agreement. There is thus no proof that the military
concluded that a solution to its needs could not be found, e.g. by frequency re-
use, and that its needs could not be met by the remaining S-band and the planned
dedicated military satellite, GSAT-7S.

246. In addition to the military needs just addressed, the records show that a host of
other factors played a determinant role in the events leading to the CCS decision.
The following paragraphs recount the emergence of such other factors as they
surfaced in the most important documents in the record.

247. Around the same time as the 15 December meeting, on 8 December 2009,
Dr. Radhakrishnan, who had assumed his responsibilities as DOS Secretary,
Chairman of ISRO, Chair of the Space Commission and Chairman of Antrix two
months earlier, constituted the Suresh Committee to review “the legal,
commercial, procedural and technical aspects” of the Devas Agreement.?°° On
7 June 2010, Dr. Suresh transmitted his report, dated May 2010, to
Dr. Radhakrishnan. The 17-page report concludes with a set of
recommendations, which in relevant part read as follows:

"15, Recommendations

Overall review of GSAT-6, which is a state of the art satellite, in conjunction
with the ground segment which is in the process of development by the service
provider reveals a significant step for bringing a new satellite based service to
India. This review also brings out that there is scope to reexamine some of the
aspects which have been highlighted under specific review observations in
the earlier section (14) and accordingly the following specific
recommendations have been made for consideration.

(i) The utilization of the S-band frequency spectrum allotted for satellite based
services to ISRO/DOS for satellite communications is extremely important.
Therefore this aspect has to be critically examined considering all usages
including GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A by a competent technical team _on high

priority. The strategic and other essential needs of the country should also be
considered.

ie)

(iii) Considering the fact ISRO/DOS has developed GSAT 6 Satellite with
complex technologies to start a new service in the national interest it is
important that the agreement includes appropriate clauses to give explicit
preference to ISRO in case of a demand for use of this service under emergent
conditions for strategic or any other essential applications. As of today 47
months have elapsed from the payment date of first installment i.e. June 2006.
As per the agreement delay of 12 months in delivery attracts a penalty of US$
5 million this clause looks severe considering the fact that the satellite
demands development of a few complex technologies for the first time. In view
of these factors, the needs to be re-visited taking into account all
issues like ICC [Indian Satellite or INSAT Coordination Committee] quidelines,
importance of preserving the spectrum for essential _national_needs,
international standards, and also due weightage for the upfront payment made
by Devas’.?57 (emphasis added)

 

248. The Suresh report thus noted the “extremely important” use of the S-band, as
well as the “strategic and other essential needs of the country”. The report further
pointed to the need to include in the contract a clause to give explicit preference
to ISRO in case of a demand for use “under emergent conditions for strategic or
any other essential applications”, as well as the “severe” penalty clause included
in the contract for delays in the delivery of the satellites. Because of these latter
factors, the report concluded that the Devas Agreement needed to be “revisited”
taking into account, among other aspects, the “importance of preserving the
spectrum for essential national needs”.

249. Meanwhile, the existence of the Devas Agreement had also attracted attention
from the press. On 31 May and 1 June 2010, two articles appeared in the Hindu
Business Line, entitled “Devas gets preferential allocation of ISRO’s spectrum”
and “Another spectrum sold on the quiet”.2°* One article suggested that “the 2005
agreement should be annulled and the ISRO quota should be auctioned so that
the Government can raise some more much-needed money”.7°° One should
recall that such criticism was raised in the context of the 2G Scandal which later
culminated in the arrest of several former DOT officials, including the Minister of
Telecommunications.

250. Thenews reports on Devas appeared to be taken seriously by a number of senior
officers within the Government. On 4 June 2010, Dr. Chandra of the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology and the DOT wrote to
Mr. Balachandran, the Additional Secretary of ISRO, enclosing copies of these
news reports and requesting him “to kindly provide your comments on the news
reports immediately”. The letter specifically stated: “Kindly look into the matter
personally”.24° Ten days later, on 14 June 2010, Mr. Thomas, Secretary of the
Ministry of Telecommunications and the DOT, wrote to Mr. Radhakrishnan,
referring to the earlier letter from his department and noting that ISRO's
comments were still outstanding. The most recent letter re-attached copies of the
news articles and concluded as follows: “In view of the above, you are requested
to kindly look into the matter personally and expedite your comments”. On the
same day, Mr. Balanchandran requested and obtained copies of the Devas

Agreement.?4?

251. On 16 June 2010, Dr. Radhakrishnan sent two practically identical memoranda,
one to the Secretary of the DOT** and the other to the Advisor to the Law
Minister,?44 attaching copies of the Devas Agreement and raising, among other
things, two issues:

“(i) With these two satellites blocking a significant portion of our S-band

satellite spectrum, we do face crunch for accommodating our strategic needs
that has emerged subsequently after signing of ANTRIX-Devas contract.

(ii) The satellite based Devas Multimedia services also call for terrestrial
supplementation (enclosure-2) wherever there are high rising buildings (that
means all major urban areas). Whether this would deny a level playing ground
for other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.”

252. The question that Dr. Radhakrishnan asked the DOT Secretary and the Advisor
to the Law Minister was as follows:

“In the above context, we seek your legal opinion on whether ANTRIX-Devas.
contract need be annulled invoking any of the provisions of the contract in
order to (i) to preserve the precious S band spectrum for the strategic
requirements of the nation and, (ii) to ensure a level playing field for the other
service providers using terrestrial spectrum.”

253. On 18 June 2010, the Advisor to the Law Minister provided his reply.24° Referring
to a meeting held with Dr. Radhakrishnan, he stated:

“4. During the discussion, it was told to us that after the signing of aforesaid
agreement, new strategic needs have been emerged which require
accommodation in our S Band spectrum. Department have to provide
sufficient space/accommodation in the satellite to meet the demand for
strategic needs of BSF [Border Security Force], CISF [Central Industrial
Security Force], RPF [Railway Police Force] and CRPF [Central Reserve
Police Force].”

254. The Advisor then offered the following opinion:

“412. Therefore, the Central Government (Department of Space) in exercise of
its sovereign power and function, if so desire and feel appropriate, may take
a policy decision to the effect that due to the needs of strategic requirements,
the Central Govt/ISRO would not be able to provide orbit slot in S band for
operating PS1 to the ANTRIX for commercial activities. In that event, ANTRIX
in terms of Article 7(c) read with Article 11, of the agreement may terminate
the agreement and inform M/s DEVAS accordingly.

13. As far as the second issue relating to terrestrial supplementation and level
playing field since the Department of Telecom is administratively concerned
that Department may also be consulted.”

255. With a view to the upcoming 117" meeting of the Space Commission of 2 July
2010, the Additional Secretary of the DOS, Mr. Balachandran, prepared a “Note
to the Space Commission”, dated 30 June 2010, which extensively set out the
background of the facts until that time.24° The purpose of the Note was set out as
follows:

"L...] to (i) apprise Space Commission on certain concerns that have arisen
over a contract signed between ANTRIX Corporation, a public sector unit and
the commercial arm of DOS with M/s DEVAS Multimedia Pvt Limited on
January 28, 2005 for lifetime lease of 90% capacity of S-band Transponders

seek guidance on the prudent utilization of the S-band spectrum of 150 MHz
allocated to ISRO; and (iv) further course of actions to be followed by the
Department."247

256. The Note then set out the “Requirements of Strategic Users and Societal Services
for S-Band Transponders’” as follows:
“8.1. The GSAT-7 Satellite (for strategic user) being built by ISRO since 2006
and with launch targeted in mid-2010 has S-Band transponders for MSS
applications with 15 MHz bandwidth each for up-linking and down-linking.
Further, the Armed Forces have been discussing with ISRO on the imminent

need to build Satellites with capacity in various frequency bands including
significant component in S-band (GSAT-7S).

8.2 The Directorate of Integrated Space Cell, Ministry of Defence, during their
meeting with ISRO in December 2009, has projected a need for 17.5 MHz in
S-band for immediate use and addition of 40 MHz during 12th Plan period and
a further addition of 50 MHz during the 13th Plan period. The demands
received in this regard are at para 7 at page-3 of Annexure-lll.

8.3 There are also demands for S-band transponders from Internal Security
Agencies viz. BSF, CISF, CRPF, Coast Guard and Police, and further, there
are requirements projected by Indian Railways for train-tracking.

8.4 From societal services point of view, currently the GSAT-2 (MSS) and
INSAT-3C (BSS and MSS) have S-band Transponders. There are other
national societal requirements for emergency communication, dissemination
of disaster warnings, tele-education, tele-health and rural communication”.
(emphasis added)

257. The Note also referred to other concerns, such as the “existence on record of a
few anomalies that suggest that full information has not been provided to Cabinet
and Space Commission”4® and the fact that “DEVAS, which has a large foreign
equity, can assign or sell or sub-licence any and all of its rights under this
agreement: without any approvals from ANTRIX, the security implications that
can arise as a consequence, would need serious consideration”.”4°

258. In view of the preceding discussion, the Note essentially indicated three reasons
for seeking legal advice from the Law Minister on how to annul the contract:

“Considering all these facts it was decided in the Department of Space that:

(i) in order to give priority to the demand for fulfillment of strategic
requirements that have been received at DOS (Annexure-IV refers), which is
in tune with DOS's stated policy as seen by DOS's correspondences with
various fora of Govt. (Annexure-XI refers);

Case 2:18-cv-01360 Document 2-2 Filed 09/13/18 Page 139 of 258

(ii) due to the opaqueness being seen in the preliminary examination of the
documents in hand (Annexures V-X refers) of Antrix-Devas contract which
would suggest, inter-alia, that the non exclusiveness to be ensured while
allotting S-Band to private players was not observed; and,

(iii) considering the fact that Dept of telecommunications had not been
consulted over a service that includes terrestrial connectivity and the
implications thereon including denial of a level playing field,

it was decided to request Ministry of Law and justice to give its opinion as to
how to annul the contract.” (emphasis added)

259. The Note concluded that it was “inevitable to annul” the Devas Agreement, and
proposed the following “[flurther courses of action and implications”:

“15.1 Annulling the Contract: Considering the need (i) to preserve S-band
spectrum for national requirements in strategic sector and for societal
applications, (ii) certain concerns on technical, managerial, financial and
contractual aspects of ANTRIX-DEVAS contract, and (iii) issues involved in
DEVAS obtaining the Spectrum License for the proposed services,
(para 13.2 j refers) it would be inevitable to annul the ANTRIX-DEVAS
contract.”

260. The Tribunal notes that the annulment of the Agreement, presented now as
“inevitable”, was justified by the DOS Additional Secretary on a host of very
different reasons. The Note first refers to “strategic requirements”, put alongside
with the requirement for “societal applications”. In that respect, the Note, in
particular, speaks of “Indian Railways for train-tracking” and “national societal
requirements for emergency communication, dissemination of disaster warnings,
tele-education, tele-health and rural communication’. In addition, the Note refers
to other concerns, including the Agreement’s alleged “opaqueness” and the
possibility that Devas could assign its rights without Antrix’s approval.

261. It bears noting further that, even when referring to the national security grounds
(para. 8.2 of the Note quoted supra), the only document invoked to justify the
annulment of the Agreement are the minutes of the 15 December 2009 meeting,
discussed above, where the military needs allegedly “crystallized”.2°° However,
as observed earlier, that document establishes no incompatibility between those
needs and the Devas Agreement, but rather envisages that “other avenues” could
have been pursued. The Note does not explain whether the military had been

successful in seeking to meet spectrum limitations by the IDS decision “to explore

new avenues’.

262. On 2 July 2010, the Space Commission held its 117" meeting.2°' The minutes
record as follows:

“117.6.3. [...] The Integrated Space Cell of IDS, Ministry of Defence have
projected a need for 17.5 MHz in S band for meeting the immediate
requirements of Armed Forces, another 40 MHz during the 12th plan period
and an additional 50 MHz during the 13th plan period. Armed Forces have
also projected the need to build S band satellite capacity through GSAT-7S,
for national security related mobile communications. There are further
demands for S band transponders from internal security agencies viz., BSF,
CISF, CRPF, Coast Guard and Police for meeting their secured
communication needs. Indian Railways have also projected _S band
requirements for traintracking.

117.6.4. Commission noted that, in view of these emerging requirements,
there is an imminent need to preserve the S band spectrum for vital strategic
and societal applications. Besides this, there were also certain concerns on
the technical, commercial, managerial and financial aspects of the Antrix-
Devas contract such as, severe penalty clauses for delayed delivery of the
spacecraft and for performance failure/service interruptions, violation of the
INSAT Coordination Committee's (ICC) quideline of 'non-exclusiveness' in
leasing the capacity, the contract enabling Devas to sub-lease the capacity
without any approvals- which could even give rise to security concerns, etc.”
(emphasis added)

263. Furthermore:

“117.6.6. [...] It was noted that Space spectrum is a vital national resource and
it is of utmost importance to preserve it for emerging national applications for
Strategic uses and societal applications. Given the limited availability of S

band spectrum, meeting the strategic and societal needs is of higher priority
than commercial /entertainment sectors.” (emphasis added)

264. In light of these observations, the Space Commission gave the following
directions:
“(a) Department, in view of priority to be given to nation's strategic
requirements including societal ones may take actions necessary and instruct

Antrix to annul the Antrix-Devas contract.

(b) Department may revive the ICC [Indian Satellite or INSAT Coordination
Committee] mechanism.

(c) Department may evolve a revised utilization plan for GSAT-6 and GSAT-

6A satellites, taking into account the strategic and societal imperatives of the
country. [...]” (emphasis added)

265. It is clear from a plain reading of these minutes that the military needs were only
one of several reasons for the annulment of the Agreement — together with
broader societal needs, such as train-tracking, and concerns about the contract
terms. In fact, the lack of transparency and the contractual terms perceived as
unduly favorable to Devas were not secondary concerns. This is evident from the
note (marked “secret”) which Mr. Chandrasekhar, Cabinet Secretary, who had
attended this Space Commission meeting, sent a few months later to the Prime
Minister.252. In his account on the annulment to the Prime Minister,
Mr. Chandrasekhar reported that:

“L...] since the agreement has now had to be cancelled on account of reasons
related to non-transparency and one-sided skew in risk sharing arrangements,
ISRO / DoS are left with a satellite [...] which has no immediate commercial
application.”25>

266. A few days after the Space Commission meeting of 2 July 2010,
Dr. Radhakrishnan wrote to the ASG, seeking legal advice. The DOS Secretary
recalled that “[s]ubsequent to signing of [the Devas] agreement, the Government
has received a lot of demands from various wings of the Government for
allocation of S band spectrum to them to meet up the strategic and societal
requirements of the nation”.2°4 His request to the ASG read as follows:

“7. The Department of Space has been advised by the Space Commission to
get vetted by the legal expert:

(i) the relevant resolution of the Space Commission in this regard;

(ii) the letter to be written by Dept of Space to Antrix intimating them that the
required s-band spectrum would not be made available to them due to nation's
fequirements to utilise the same in strategic and societal areas; and

(iii) the letter from Antrix to Devas intimating them that Antrix is not able to get
the relevant clearance from the Government for release of spectrum and
hence the agreement is terminated.” (emphasis added)

267. On 12 July 2010, the ASG provided his opinion.25° He set out the issue before
him in the following terms:

“The core issue which arises for consideration is as to whether there are
justifiable or legal grounds existing for termination of Antrix-Devas contract.”

268. TheASG recalled the “tremendous demand for allocation of spectrum for national
needs, including for the needs of the Defence, para-military forces, railways and
other public utility services as well as for societal needs”. He excluded that the
conditions stipulated in Article 7 (in particular 7(c) on Antrix’s right of “termination

for convenience” “in the event Antrix is unable to obtain the necessary frequency

and orbital slot coordination required”) could be invoked to terminate the Devas
Agreement and rather advised to rely on the force majeure provision contained
in Article 11:

“It is always advisable that in the present case, instead of the Department of
Space taking a decision to terminate, it would be more prudent that a decision
is taken by the Government of India, as a matter of policy, in exercise of its
executive power or in other words, a policy decision having the seal and
approval of the Cabinet and duly gazetted as per the Business Rules of the
Government of India: That would give a greater legal sanctity to the decision
to terminate the contract in as much as the contractual provisions expressly
stipulate that for the force majeure event, to disable one of the parties to
perform its obligations under the contract, the act must be an act by the
governmental authority acting in its sovereign capacity. Several reasons exist
to resort to this sovereign power for preserving national interest. In my view,
instead of the Department of Space directing Antrix to terminate the contract,
it will be advisable from a legal perspective that the direction comes from the
Department of Space on the basis of a governmental policy decision, as
indicated above. | have nothing further to add.” (emphasis added)

269. Several months then passed. On 16 February 2011, Dr. Radhakrishnan
submitted a “Note to the Cabinet Committee on Security” (CCS), the purpose of
which was “to seek approval of Cabinet Committee on Security for [a]nnulling”
the Devas Agreement “in view of priority to be given to nation's strategic
requirements including societal ones”.?5° Although it is clear from the evidence
reviewed above that there were several reasons for the annulment, in light of the
ASG advice only the strategic and societal needs were put forward at this juncture

to justify reliance on the agreement's force majeure clause.

270. In addition to reviewing in detail the factual background until that date, including
all of the developments described above, Dr. Radhakrishnan’s note of
16 February 2011 reported certain “inter-Ministerial consultations’, which
reflected the views of various Ministries on the draft note to the CCS which had
previously been circulated. For these purposes, the responses from the MOD and
the Ministry of Telecommunications as well as the comments from the DOS

appear relevant:

"44.2) Ministry of Defence: The Ministry has not raised any objection to the
proposals contained in the draft Note.

The Ministry has indicated that there is a requirement of S Band capacity for
strategic uses which is already addressed in this Note. It has also been stated
that the Defence Services have extensive existing as well as planned usages
in the S-Band. The barest minimum requirement of Services is projected as
120 MHz. Further, they have also suggested that any planned release of S
Band capacity may be done in consultation with Ministry of Defence/Services.
Acopy of the communication received from the Ministry is placed at Annexure-
8 (Page 128).

Comments of DOS: The comments/suggestions in respect of allocation of S
Band capacity are noted and would be placed before the INSAT Coordination
Committee and the Technical Advisory Group, which are empowered to take
decisions in the matter.

44.3) Ministry of Telecommunications: The Ministry has not raised any
objection to the proposals contained in the draft Note. However, they have
made a number of suggestions in respect of the usage of the S Band and
recommended that the present and future strategic requirements for national
security related mobile communications and societal applications may be
discussed in the meetings of the INSAT Co-ordination Committee (ICC) where
representatives of Department of Space, Department of Telecommunications,
Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Ministry of Finance, Department of
Science and Technology and even Ministry of Defence could be invited to
attend. A. copy of the communication received from the Ministry is placed at
Annexure-9 (Page 129-131).

Comments of DOS: The comments/suggestions in respect of allocation of S
Band capacity are noted and would be placed before the INSAT Coordination
Committee and the Technical Advisory Group, which are empowered to take
decisions in the matter.” (emphasis added)

271. Atthe end of this note, Dr. Radhakrishnan set out the “approval sought” from the
CCS in the following terms:

“45.1) Taking note of the fact that government policies with regard to allocation
of spectrum have undergone a change in the last few years and there has
been a[n] increased demand for the allocation of spectrum for national needs,
including for the needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other
public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the
needs of the country's strategic requirements, the Government will not be able
to provided orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities including for

those which are the subject matter of existing contractual obligations for S
Band.

45.2) In the light of this policy not providing orbit slot in S Band to Antric for
commercial activities, the “Agreement for the lease of space segment capacity
on ISRO/Antrix S-Band spacecraft by Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd.” entered into
between Antrix Corporation and Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. on 28th January,
2005 shall be annulled forthwith.

46) Further, Department of Space may take action to implement the decisions
of the Space Commission referred to in paragraph 42 of the Note.” (emphasis
added)

272. Reflecting these terms, the CCS finally resolved to annul the Devas Agreement
on 17 February 2011. It is important to set out the Press Information Bureau

release in full:257
“CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal

Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has decided to annul the Antrix-Devas
deal. Following is the statement made by the Law Minister, Shri M. Veerappa
Moily on the decision taken by the CCS which met in New Delhi today:

Taking note of the fact that Government policies with regard to allocation of
spectrum have undergone a change in the last few years and there has been
an increased demand for allocation of spectrum for national needs, including
for the needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other public utility
services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the
country's strategic requirements, the Government will not be able to provide
orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities, including for those which
are the subject matter of existing contractual obligations for S band.

In light of this policy of not providing orbit slot in S Band to Antrix for
commercial activities, the “Agreement for the lease of space segment capacity
on ISRO/Antrix S-Band spacecraft by Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd.” entered into
between Antrix Corporation and Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. on 28th January,
2005 shall be annulled forthwith.” (emphasis added)

273. Onits face, the CCS decision effected the removal of the S-band spectrum from
Antrix for commercial use and, as a result of such removal, ordered that the
Devas Agreement be annulled forthwith.25® The reasons cited for such action

ar Press Information Bureau, “CCS Decides to Annul Devas-Antrix Deal”, 17 February 2011,
Exh. C-031.

2S In accordance with this decision, on 23 February 2011, DOS informed Antrix that the
Government would not be able to provide orbit slot in S-band to Antrix for commercial
activities including those which were the subject-matter of existing agreements. It thus
directed Antrix that the Devas Agreement “shall be annulled forthwith”. See Letter from
B.S. Anantharamu, DOS, to Executive Director, M/s. Antrix Corporation Ltd., 23 February
2011, Exh. R-032. On 25 February 2011, Antrix terminated the Devas Agreement with
immediate effect. See Letter from Antrix (Mr. Madhusudhan) to Devas, 25 February 2011,

were “national needs, including for the needs of defence, para-military forces,
railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs” as well as
“the needs of the country's strategic requirements”. While taking back the S-band
from Antrix-Devas, it is important to note that there is no indication that the CCS
at the same time allocated the “precious S-Band” to the military or the MOD or
otherwise earmarked that spectrum for security interests.

274. The fact that the S-band was not so assigned is confirmed by the subsequent
discussions within the Government, which continued for a considerable amount
of time. In particular, in the ensuing inter-ministerial debate, the DOS advocated
for satellite, “strategic and societal” use, while the DOT pleaded for terrestrial,
commercial use. In the context of the discussions in the Empowered Group of
Ministers (EGOM), before which the issue was first brought,?®° the DOS stated
that “Services in S band will be used by strategic and government services and
the requirement is only for MSS [...]".28° The DOT understood this to mean that
the DOS had “no plan for BSS applications” and accordingly requested vacation
of the BSS S-band by the DOS to allow the spectrum to be used for (terrestrial,
commercial) BWA.76"

275. The matter was then submitted to a sub-committee of the INSAT Coordination
Committee (ICC). The 10 July 2013 Report of the ICC Sub-Committee on S-band
Utilization Plan is particularly illustrative of the impasse reached within the
Government:

“Introduction

ICC-72 during its meeting held on July 27, 2012 constituted the ICC Sub-
Committee to prepare S-band Utilization Plan (2500 MHz — 2690 MHz) with
the members from Department of Space (DOS), Department of

The committee had three meetings (Nov 16, 2012, Jan 18, 2013 and March
08, 2013) to discuss and finalise the task assigned. Members participating in
the meetings are attached in Annexure — 1.

2. Deliberations

Members of the committee deliberated current and future usage of Sband
(2500 MHz — 2690 MHz) in the country. After the first meeting, attempts were
made to prepare a draft report. However consensus could not be reached and
members provided separate inputs to the Sub-Committee.

(a) DOS/ISRO (enclosed in Annexure — 2)
(b) WPC/DOT (enclosed in Annexure — 3)
(c) MOD (enclosed in Annexure — 4)
(d) TRAI (enclosed in Annexure — 5)

While DOS and MOD is in favor of using 80 MHz of S-BSS and 70 MHZ of S-
BSS for satellite based services, WPC/DOT and TRAI is not in agreement with
the approach. The committee could not converge on the final recommendation
with regard to the utilization plan and use of Sband by terrestrial and satellite
services.

3. Conclusions

Opinion of each Department/Ministry is attached as an Annexure and is
submitted for the consideration of ICC for further directives”.°? (emphasis
added)

276. The report just quoted demonstrates the divergences on spectrum allocations
and needs among ministries and departments that had continued for years after
the CCS decision. The outcome of this debate is not entirely clear. It appears
that, in a Cabinet decision of 21 January 2015, i.e. almost four years after the
CCS decision which took back the S-band from Antrix-Devas, India finally
allocated the MSS part of the spectrum to the MOD.?® The only documentary
evidence in the record is a half-page extract of a DOT document communicating
a 21 January 2015 Cabinet decision. That DOT extract on the “Defence Band
and Defence Interest Zone” identifies certain frequencies reserved for “Defence
Services’*4 and contains the following chart:

Defence, security and societal applications.

2655-2680 MHz

 

 

277. This chart shows a discrepancy between the “Frequency band” and the
“Remarks” columns. In the former, two frequency bands are identified, namely
the 70 MHz (two times 35 MHz) of the MSS portion of the S-band (of which Devas
was leasing 10 MHz). In the latter, in addition to those two, the BSS portion of 80
MHz (of which Devas was leasing 60 MHz) is also included, and is earmarked
“for Defence, security and societal applications”.”© It is thus unclear whether the
BSS portion of the spectrum was finally allocated to the Defence band. In this
connection, it is noteworthy that the military had focused on the MSS portion, not
the BSS portion, which constituted the majority (60 out of 70 MHz) of the
spectrum subject to the Devas Agreement.?6°

278. By contrast, the DOT extract establishes that the DOT was allowed to retain its
portion of S-band, the two times 20 MHz in the frequency bands of 2535-2555
and 2635-2655 MHz. The following diagram, excerpted from the Claimant's
opening presentation,?°” depicts the allocation of S-band following the 2015
Cabinet decision, being noted that assignment of the 80 MHz DOS (BSS) to
defense band is unclear due to the discrepancy in the chart as discussed above:

279. With regard to the 40 MHz of S-band which the DOT retained, the Tribunal notes
that it was intended to be sold at forthcoming commercial auctions by the DOT,
with a high reserve price set, as confirmed by the Telecom Regulatory Authority
of India (“TRAI”).2°° The planned auction by the DOT of its S-band for commercial
use was completed in October 2016.25?

280. Having set out the thrust of the evidence on record, the Tribunal reverts now to
the question whether India has established that (i) “essential security interests”
existed and that (ii) it was “necessary” to protect such interests by way of the
impugned measure, i.e. the CCS decision.

281. On the first point, it is beyond doubt that the documents leading to the CCS
decision evince in a constant fashion that a mix of reasons or objectives led to
the annulment of the Devas Agreement. The mention of “strategic” and “societal”
needs is recurrent in the vast majority of documents and these needs are almost
invariably presented together.?”° The Tribunal would of course accept that the so-
called strategic needs expressed by the Armed Forces meet the test for essential
security interests. Likewise, it would accept the same qualification for the national

security interests expressed by the so-called “internal security agencies”, such as
the Border Security Force, the Central Industrial Security Force or the Central
Reserve Police Force.?”' By contrast, it cannot see how, on any reasonable
reading of Article 12, other “societal needs”, such as train-tracking,?’? disaster
management, tele-education, tele-health and rural communication,?”* appearing
side by side with the strategic interests in numerous documents, could be
included within the “essential security interests” without distorting the natural
meaning of such term. These needs may constitute “public interests” that may
become relevant for other Treaty provisions, such as Article 5. However, as
already explained, to achieve the far-reaching consequences that a successful
invocation of Article 12 entails, that of entirely dis-applying the Treaty, the
existence of a much more restricted range of interests must be shown.

282. The “strategic and societal” interests, just discussed, were not, however, the only
reasons that led India to revoke the S-band spectrum allocated to Antrix-Devas.
The record demonstrates that a number of other factors played a crucial role in
India’s decision:

a. First, starting from 2009, there was a clear concern that Devas had acquired valuable
spectrum for too low a price. At various junctures, the press focused on this concern
in the belief that the Devas-Antrix deal could reveal a political scandal similar to the
2G Scandal.’ The concerns voiced in the media were taken very seriously at least
by certain arms of the Indian Government, in particular within the DOT.?’5 Moreover,
within the DOS there was a belief that Devas had acquired the spectrum in a non-

transparent or opaque fashion?”® - “on the sly”, as India’s witness Mr. Anand
testified.27”

b. Second, there were concerns about certain commercial terms of the Devas
Agreement which were perceived as too onerous to the Indian party, in particular the
penalties for delays in satellite deliveries.?”° The various reports also refer to the risk
of new foreign investment into the asset, reflecting a concern that there was no
control over a possible assignment of the Agreement.?7°

c. Finally, there was a further worry that there was no “level playing field” so far as
terrestrial operators were concerned, as clearly emerges from various letters of
Dr. Radhakrishnan.28

283. It barely needs mentioning that none of the concerns just referred to, whether
well-founded or not, may be considered matters of “essential security interests”
within the meaning of Article 12 of the BIT.

284. By way of conclusion on the question of whether essential security interests
existed based on India’s contemporaneous assertions during the process leading
to the CCS decision, it is clear that there was a mix of reasons for the annulment
of the Agreement and only some of those can, on an objective analysis, be said
to relate to “essential security interests” within the meaning of Article 12 of the
BIT. The question is thus whether the CCS decision was “necessary” to protect
those interests, in the sense that it was principally targeted to safeguard “to the
extent necessary” the defense and other strategic needs that fall within the
purview of “essential security interests”.

285. On this second point, the Tribunal finds that India has failed to establish that the
CCS decision was necessary to protect those essential security interests. This

ensues mainly from the import and intended effect of the CCS decision, as well
as from subsequent events.

286. Starting from the CCS decision, it is clear from a simple reading of the text that
such measure was only directed at taking away the relevant S-band spectrum
from Antrix-Devas, thereby creating the legal conditions for Antrix to invoke force
majeure and effect termination. The CCS decision did not, by contrast, reserve
the spectrum for “essential security interests’. It referred to the “needs of defence,
para-military forces, railways and other public utility services as well as for
societal needs’, and did not allocate the S-band to one or the other among those
very different needs. Because the import of the CCS decision remained
undetermined, such measure was not principally targeted to safeguard India’s
essential security interests. In other words, as long as the choice among these
potential usages (some of which were unrelated to essential security interests,
as the Tribunal has noted above) remained open, the measure was not
“necessary” to protect the state’s essential security interests.

287. The absence of any necessity is corroborated by the events after the CCS
decision. Had there been any essential security interests necessary to protect,
there would have been no protracted debate lasting almost four years among
organs of the Government about the use of this spectrum for strategic and
societal purposes, on the one hand, or commercial auctioning purposes, on the
other hand. The Tribunal thus agrees with the Dissenting Opinion in the Mauritius
BIT Arbitration, whereby:

“In these circumstances, it is impossible to say that the decision of the CCS
was directed towards the “essential security interests” of India. The question
of S-band spectrum allocation remained open in February 2011 and the
debate as to where that S-band spectrum could have gone could just as
readily have favoured DOT's preference for public auction by terrestrial users
as it could have gone to DOS and or MOD to be used for military purposes or
disaster management or railway tracking. As long as these various potential
uses remained under consideration and subject to debate, there was no
identified purpose for the CCS decision. There were only possible uses and
until it was determined, there was no action directed at the protection of
essential security interests or the military interests no matter what the MOD or
its several different arms may have requested or wished for.”26

288. Thus, in light of the evidence presented before it, including certain unredacted
portions of documents which may not have been available to the Mauritius BIT
tribunal, this Tribunal cannot reach the same conclusion as the one reached by
that tribunal on the fulfilment of the essential security interest clause, including as
to a 60/40 apportionment of spectrum between essential security interests and
other concerns. The Tribunal also wishes to underscore that the non-precluded
measures clause in the BIT applicable in this case requires it to find that a
measure was “necessary” to protect essential security interest, and not merely
“directed at the protection” of such interests as was required under the treaty at
issue in the Mauritius BIT Arbitration.?8? In the Tribunal’s view, the phrase “to the
extent necessary” implies a more stringent nexus between the measure at issue
and the interests pursued. Given the lack of determinacy of the CCS decision and
the protracted debate between branches of the Government which ensued, the
Tribunal finds that India has not established the presence of such nexus in the
circumstances of this case.

289. The facts that several years later (part of) the S-band may have been assigned
to defense band and the GSAT-6 launched in January 2015 for strategic
purposes only show that, after several years of impasse, one of the two
contenders within the Indian administration succeeded with its demands. It does
not, however, in any way affect the Tribunal’s conclusion that India’s measure
was not necessary at that point in time.

290. The absence of essential security interests necessary to protect is also shown by
India’s treatment of the remaining part of the S-band. Initially, the Government
allowed the Government-owned terrestrial operators to continue using the DOT
S-band portion for commercial purposes. The shortage of S-band which allegedly
crystallized in December 2009 is hard to reconcile with India’s decision to license
part of the S-band to these Government-owned operators for commercial use in
May 2010.78 It is true that the DOT later took this spectrum back from those

a2 The non-precluded measures clause (Art. 11(3)) in the Mauritius-India BIT, at issue in the
Mauritius BIT Arbitration, reads as follows: “The provisions of this Agreement shall not in
any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of
any kind or take any other action which is directed to the protection of its essential security
interests, or to the protection of public health or the prevention of diseases in pests or
animals or plants”).

entities.2°4 However, as discussed above in the context of the January 2015
Cabinet decision, the DOT was allowed to retain 40 MHz of S-band for
commercial use. The Tribunal is unconvinced by India’s explanation that,
because it did not have the relevant international coordination for those 40 MHz,
it had to start the coordination process with the ITU which could have taken years
without guarantee of success.”* If there was a true instance of “essential security
interests’, it would have been logical to nonetheless start the coordination
process especially as time did not seem to be of the essence for the Government
which allowed the debate between the DOT and DOS to continue for almost four
years. Neither the Space Commission, nor the CCS even considered those
reasonable, least restrictive alternative measures, although they were clearly
available.

291. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that India has not established that its measure
to take back the S-band spectrum from Antrix-Devas, which in turn triggered the
annulment of the Agreement, was necessary for the protection of its essential
security interests. As a consequence, the BIT’s substantive standards apply to
DT’s investment.

Vi. LIABILITY

292. The Claimant contends that India’s conduct violated the fair and equitable
treatment (FET”) standard (A); constituted direct and indirect expropriation (B);
and violated the full protection and security (“FPS”) standard.

1. The Claimant’s position
a. International minimum standard and FET

294. The Claimant notes that Article 3(2) of the BIT guarantees fair and equitable
treatment without reference to the minimum standard under general international
law. Thus, for DT, there is no “plausible justification to limit the interpretation of
fair and equitable treatment to the international minimum standard”.28° The
authorities invoked by India in support of its argument that FET under the BIT is
equivalent to the minimum standard in Neer v. Mexico?®’ are inapposite.?88 More

specifically:

e The cases under the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”)
on which the Respondent relies are irrelevant, given that NAFTA tribunals
are under an obligation to equate FET with the customary international
law minimum standard by virtue of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission's
interpretation;26°

e In invoking the dissenting opinion of Pedro Nikken in Suez v. Argentina,
the Respondent overlooks the majority's view that the FET provisions of
the France-Argentina and Spain-Argentina BITs are not confined to the
minimum standard;

e Equally misconceived is India’s reliance on the travaux of the India-Russia
BIT, which are not pertinent for the interpretation of this BIT and in any
event do not show that FET is limited to the minimum standard of

treatment.

295. Moreover, even if the FET in the BIT were to be construed to reflect the minimum
standard of treatment, the Claimant argues that contemporary minimum
standards incorporate FET. This is so because the minimum standard is not

frozen in time and has evolved since the interpretation given in Neer. Numerous
investment treaty tribunals have adopted such approach:

e In CMS v. Argentina, the tribunal ruled that the treaty standard of FET
requiring “stability and predictability of business environment, founded on
solemn legal and contractual commitments, is not different from the
international law minimum standard and its evolution under customary

law"?

e In Occidental v. Ecuador, the tribunal considered that “the Treaty standard
is not different from that required under international law concerning both
the stability and predictability of the legal and business framework of the

investment’;292

e In Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, the tribunal held that “the actual content of
the treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment is not materially
different from the content of the minimum standard of treatment in

customary international law’.2°>

296. Therefore, so argues DT, irrespective of whether Article 3(2) of the BIT is held to
refer to the minimum standard (and based on its text, it does not), India’s
measures must be tested against the FET standard, which mandates respect for
the investors’ legitimate expectations as well as compliance with the principles of
good faith, transparency, consistency, and non-discrimination.?*

297. More specifically, DT asserts that its FET claim is based on “three independent
limbs”:285

(b) India’s conduct was unjustified, arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate
and lacking in good faith; and

(c) India’s conduct was non-transparent and failed to accord DT due
process.”296

b. India’s violation of DT’s legitimate expectations

The Claimant explains that the obligation to accord FET requires India to abide

by specific undertakings made to, and relied upon by, foreign investors.?°”

DT submits further that, when investing in Devas, it relied on India’s assurances
that the Agreement guaranteed the exclusive allocation of the relevant S-band
spectrum to Devas, and that no steps would be taken to frustrate Devas’s
contractual rights. India also committed itself to launch two satellites for the
exploitation of the Devas Spectrum. These assurances were given in December
2007 at the meetings between the representatives of the DOS, ISRO and Antrix,
on the one hand, and DT, on the other. In particular, the Claimant makes

reference to the following main sources of its expectations:

e Based on the National Frequency Allocation Plan?° and India’s SatCom
Policy,?°° DT expected that the commercial terrestrial re-use of spectrum

would be allowed and indeed encouraged;

e In December 2004, Antrix’s Board approved the Agreement and later
allowed it to enter into force, thereby creating the expectation that the

Agreement would be honored according to its terms;3°

e The DOT granted ISP°°' and IPTV%° licenses to Devas and the WPC.
issued a license to re-use spectrum terrestrially for the purposes of
experimental trials;°°°

e Throughout the development of the Devas Project, the Indian Space
Authorities repeatedly assured Devas and DT that the construction of the

GSAT-6 satellite was underway in compliance with the Agreement;°%4

e Asto the WPC License, although DT had received no specific assurance
that it would be granted, it legitimately expected that the license
application, once made, “would be dealt with fairly, rationally and
consistently with India’s space policies”.5°°

300. Hence, DT’s expectation that Devas was entitled to the spectrum under the
Agreement was substantiated by concrete assurances from the hierarchy of the
competent Indian authorities. India’s measure to annul the Agreement and to
make the leased spectrum unavailable was thus contrary to DT’s legitimate
expectations in reliance on which it decided to invest in India.

Cc. India’s unjustified, unreasonable, arbitrary and bad faith conduct

301. DT submits that India’s conduct was arbitrary in the sense used by the ICJ in
ELSI, that is “willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at
least surprises, judicial propriety’.°°° This standard of arbitrariness does not
require a showing of bad faith, although India also breached the basic obligation
to act in good faith.2°” In reliance on AES v. Hungary, DT argues that “the rational
policy is not enough to justify all the measures taken by a state in its name’.
Rather, one must also consider “the nature of the measure and the way it is

implemented”.°° It further cites to Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, where the tribunal
deemed Venezuela in breach of the FET standard, because the state’s actions
were dictated by reasons other than those officially stated.°°° Similarly, here, the
reason why India decided to annul the Agreement is that it was starting to view it
as a bad deal.

302. Even if it were true that India faced strategic needs, the manner in which it
implemented its decision was arbitrary and unreasonable. In this context, DT
points to the fact that, although the Agreement was under review, the Indian
Space Authorities continued to assure Devas that the preparation for the launch
of the satellites was proceeding and went on to work with Devas to finalize the
draft WPC License application. Moreover, the CCS ratified the annulment of the
Agreement at a time when Mr. Radhakrishnan had already announced on
television the decision “to take actions to annul the Agreement”.*"° Although the
Respondent tries to portray its action as a general policy decision on spectrum
usage, the measure resulted in a targeted scrutiny of the Agreement and Devas
was the only entity affected by the measure.°"'

303. Furthermore, for DT, the FET standard requires that a measure be proportionate
to the declared policy objective. In the Claimant's view, India could resort to less
harmful measures to satisfy its alleged military needs. For instance, it could have
re-negotiated with Devas to take back some spectrum, or used the Devas system
to provide military applications (as had been discussed with Devas), or re-
assigned some or all of the 40MHZ of S-Band spectrum which DOS had

relinquished to DOT for terrestrial use.°'2

304. For all these reasons, the Claimant concludes that India’s conduct breached
Article 3(2) of the BIT.

d. India’s violation of due process and transparency

305. The Claimant also asserts that the Respondent's measures were not transparent
and violated due process, in that the Indian Space Authorities failed to explain
their concerns to Devas or its shareholders. The Claimant refers in particular to
the following facts to show a lack of transparency on the part of the Indian
Government:

e While Mr. Radhakrishnan had instigated a review of the Agreement in
December 2009, Antrix assured Devas at the end of the same month that
“Antrix / ISRO is putting all efforts to meet the launch schedule of July
2010”.318 Moreover, in February 2010, with the review still pending,
Mr. Radhakrishnan gave Devas a new launch deadline of September
2010.94

e Whereas the Space Commission had decided to annul the Agreement in
July 2010,°"° at the joint status review of the following month, Antrix and

e. Attribution

306. DT contends that, in addition to the conduct of the DOS, ISRO, the Space
Commission, the CCS, and the WPC, the conduct of the state-owned enterprise
Antrix must be attributed to India. To this effect, there is no need to show that
Antrix was exercising a governmental function under Article 5 of the ILC Articles,
since the ground for attribution in this case is that Antrix was under the direction
and control of India pursuant to Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

307. In particular, India cannot dispute that throughout the relevant period the same
person wore the “four hats” of Chairman of Antrix, Chairman of ISRO, Secretary
of the DOS, and Chairman of the Space Commission.°?? Antrix itself was devoid
of distinct personality, having “no effective independent existence from ISRO”
and being “under the control of the DOS”.2?8

308. Having established that Antrix was under the direction and control of India, DT
does not need to also show that, when “repeatedly misleading Devas and DT
about its intention to perform the Agreement’, Antrix acted in the exercise of
governmental authority.5*4 Indeed, being under India’s control, Antrix’s acts were
in any event attributable to India under international law.

2. The Respondent’s position

309. It is the Respondent's submission that the Claimant's “broad interpretation of the
FET standard, coupled with allegations of ‘assurances’ of a generalized nature
from unspecified Indian officials” cannot make out a legal claim for the violation
of the BIT.

a. International minimum standard and FET

310. The Respondent contends that the BIT standard of FET is confined to the
minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. By reference
to the travaux of the India-Russia BIT, India asserts that, when it entered into its
early BITs, it relied on the OECD Draft Convention of Foreign Property. Such
draft incorporated an “FET standard [...] aimed at providing protection equal to
the minimum treatment standard under customary international law’.*5 The
Claimant’s argument that the travaux of the Russia-India BIT do not reflect the
mutual intent of Germany and India misses the point, since the FET language of
the Germany-India and Germany-Russia BITs is almost identical, and it should
thus be assumed that India intended to follow the OECD Draft Convention in both
treaties.°7° In addition, as an OECD member State, Germany had the same
intention to equate FET and minimum standard when it entered into the BIT with
India.

311. The Respondent also refutes DT’s argument that reference to NAFTA practice
and the US and Canada Model BITs is irrelevant, because these instruments
contain specific language linking FET and minimum standard of treatment.
According to India, the US, Canada and the NAFTA Free Trade Commission
were compelled to clarify the scope of FET after a number of tribunals veered
towards an overbroad interpretation which was contrary to the intentions of the
contracting states.°27

312. India cites numerous authorities to support its argument that the customary
international law standard of minimum treatment is a far more stringent standard

than the loose FET standard upon which the Claimant relies.°° The Claimant is
wrong when it asserts that there is no difference between FET and the
international minimum standard. If such was the case, there would have be no
reason for the NAFTA states to issue an interpretative statement.

313. For the Respondent, the Claimant's additional argument that the minimum
standard of treatment developed to encompass the FET standard “evinces a
fundamental misunderstanding of how customary international law evolves”.°2° In
support, India quotes the ICJ in North Sea Continental Shelf, where the Court
articulated the principles governing the evolution of customary law as follows:

“State practice, including that of States whose interests are specially affected,
should have been both extensive and virtually uniform in the sense of the
provision invoked; — and should moreover have occurred in such a way as to
show a general recognition that a rule of law or legal obligation is involved.

el

Not only must the acts concerned amount to a settled practice, but they must
also be such, or be carried out in such a way, as to be evidence of a belief
that this practice is rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law
requiring it.”2°

314. According to India, the Claimant's interpretation of FET is far from being part of
customary international law. The following sources specifically disprove the
Claimant's argument:

Exh. RLA-091, p. 556 (in order to violate the minimum standard of treatment under

short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily

domestic law, but that is, indeed, a minimum standard. Acts that would violate this
minimum standard would include acts showing a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of
action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith”).

e The NAFTA Free Trade Commission issued an interpretative statement
precisely because certain tribunals went beyond the minimum standard
of treatment in interpreting FET;

e The contracting states of the Dominican Republic - Central American —
United States Free Trade Agreement (“CAFTA”) adopted a restrictive
approach to the interpretation of FET in line with the NAFTA Free Trade
Commission. They considered that FET “does not require treatment in
addition or beyond” that required by the minimum standard of
treatment.°*1

e The OECD Draft Convention, upon which India based its early BITs, took
the same stand.*?

e The European Parliament has adopted a resolution on investment policy
that confines FET to protection under customary international law. The
report accompanying the resolution stated that the reason for clarifying
the relationship between FET and the customary international law
standard was to “restrict the breadth of interpretation by the judiciary and
ensure better protection of [the] public intervention domain”.%*>

e Model investment treaties, including the ones of the US and Canada,
introduce language assimilating FET to minimum standards, precisely to
“avoid too wide interpretations and provide clear guidelines to
tribunals”.354

e Decisions of investment tribunals, although they do not constitute state
practice, also contradict the proposition that the international minimum
standard evolved so as to incorporate the broad FET standard. For
instance, Thunderbird v. Mexico noted that despite the evolution of the

high”.**5 Similarly, the Glamis Gold v. United States tribunal considered
the modern minimum standard of treatment to provide protection against
conduct which is “egregious or shocking - a gross denial of justice,
manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due process,
evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons”.*°°

e A2007 UNCTAD study supports the view that “for a country to violate the
minimum standard of treatment of aliens requires a conduct by the
Government amounting to gross misconduct, manifest injustice, an
outrage, bad faith or willful neglect of duty”.°97

e Commentators also support the proposition that the expansive
interpretation of FET is “broad-reaching”*** and does not accord with
cases or State practice, which suggest that fair and equitable treatment is
equivalent to minimum standards, providing protection for procedural
fairness and diligent consideration of the effects of a proposed
Government policy on foreign investors.°°°

315. For all these reasons, the Respondent asks the tribunal to reject the Claimant's
proposition of a broad FET standard.

b, No legitimate expectations

316. According to the Respondent, even if FET encompasses the protection of
legitimate expectations, India has never given any specific assurances to DT that
the licenses necessary for its project would be granted or that the Government
would not take steps that would adversely affect the project. DT cannot prove
otherwise. The only communications to which it refers and that preceded DT

Asia's acquisition of Devas shares were those at the meetings in Bangalore in
December 2007 and with Mr. Copp and the WPC, as well as the following
telephone call between Mr. Akhavan and the WPC. No representations or
assurances were made on any of these occasions. DT’s witness Mr. Axmann
cannot even identify with whom he met and cannot recall any particular statement

made by those unidentified persons.*4°

317. DT itself admits, so continues India, that the relevant officials from the WPC
specifically refrained from giving assurances about the WPC License, which was
crucial for rolling out the Devas System. DT in fact asked Devas to obtain such
assurances from the Government but, in light of the Government's position,
Devas expressed “reluctan[ce] to approach the authorities with the request for a
formal clarification”.*4*

318. India further argues that the Claimant’s position about the alleged assurances
that “there was no regulatory impediment to the terrestrial re-use of the spectrum
contemplated under the Agreement’ is also unsupported by the facts. Indeed, the
Claimant's witness Mr. Axmann testified that WPC “did not raise any issues or
concerns”.°4? This is clearly insufficient to constitute a specific assurance.

319. For the Respondent, DT’s allegation that it had a specific assurance that India
was committed to leasing S-band to Devas for full terrestrial re-use is equally
unsupported by the record. India, not being a party to the Agreement, “only
acknowledged that Antrix contracted with Devas’, that the satellite was being built
and “certain people within the DOS and ISRO were favorably disposed towards
the Devas Project”. All this, however, falls short of being an explicit or even an
implied commitment from the Government that it would issue the permits for the
Devas Project or that it would allow the “full terrestrial re-use” of the spectrum.*43

approach the authorities with the request for a formal clarification”).

320. Similarly, argues India, the fact that it issued ISP and IPTV licenses and an
experimental license to DT did not constitute a specific assurance that the
spectrum would be available for terrestrial re-use. These licenses have nothing
to do with the indispensable WPC License. Moreover, the experimental license
was by its very terms “[p]urely temporary” and could “be withdrawn any time
without notice”.°4

321. Furthermore, the Respondent signals a number of documents allegedly belying

the Claimant's case on legitimate expectations:

e After the meeting of 11 December 2007 with the Indian Space Authorities,
Mr. Akhavan, the CEO of T-Mobile, noted that “it became apparent that
Devas’ assumption is [sic] has secured a substantial spectrum via its
contract with ISRO may not go unchallenged by authorities other than
ISRO, with the WPC-Chairman indicating a need for further review”;545

e DT’s briefing note following the meetings with the Indian Space Authorities
refers to an “unclear regulatory regime” and to the fact that the feedback
from the Director of the WPC about the terrestrial usage of the spectrum

“was non-committal”;*4°

e The Claimant’s presentation at its Management Board meeting on
19 February 2008 mentioned the risk of delay and observed that a “worst-
case scenario would be a severe limitation in flexibility for terrestrial
usage, or a total loss of spectrum” due to the fact that the “terrestrial
utilization of spectrum requires an authorization by the [DOT]”.°4”

322. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the record shows no specific
commitment from the Government that the use of the leased spectrum would be
allowed or that the spectrum would be made available. The mere fact that Devas
had a contract with a state-owned enterprise does not represent a commitment
from the Government and the existence of such a contract cannot restrict the

State’s right to take legitimate sovereign actions that adversely affect the state-
owned entity’s contractual commitments.

om No arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate or bad faith conduct

323. The Respondent denies that it acted arbitrarily and in bad faith. In particular, it
rebuts DT’s argument that the Government failed to timely notify Devas of the
decision to annul the Agreement, which was taken in July 2010 by the Space
Commission. For India, this thesis ignores that the final decision on this matter
was taken by the CCS after consultation with all relevant entities including the
Space Commission. The Space Commission, indeed, recommended reserving
the spectrum for strategic purposes, but it resolved to seek further advice from
the ASG, who then took up the matter to the highest authority, namely the CCS.°48
Shortly before the final decision of the CCS, the Prime Minister indicated that “this
issue concerns many other Ministries apart from the Dept. of Space. These
include Dept. of [Telecommunications], Defense, Home, Finance and Law. The
matter is expected to be put before Cabinet Committee on Security for its final

decision”.54°

324. India further challenges DT’s complaints that the decision on the annulment of
the Agreement was made behind closed doors. According to India, the Claimant
fails to explain why Devas or any of its shareholders should have been informed
of or involved in the internal deliberations of the Government on matters
pertaining to national security.

325. For the Respondent, it is irrelevant that, in parallel to its internal deliberations, the
Government continued to provide updates about the progress of the satellite
launch and assisted Devas in the preparation of the WPC License application.
Until the final decision on annulment, the Agreement remained in force and there
was nothing unreasonable or inconsistent in Antrix’s continued performance of
its terms.

326. Furthermore, India disputes DT’s contention that the contested measures
targeted only the Devas Agreement, and thus left the 40MHz of S-band to the
Government-owned operators. As explained in the context of its essential

security interests defence, India submits that the concerned 40MHz of S-band
was of no use for strategic purposes.

327. The Respondent further opposes the Claimant's submissions on proportionality
for the reasons already set out in the context of essential security interests. In
this regard, it ultimately notes that “it is for the Indian authorities to make the
determination as to the amount of spectrum that is required to reach an
appropriate level of comfort with respect to the nation’s strategic needs” .*°

328. According to India, it is similarly unfounded to argue that it acted in bad faith
concealing its real intention behind the measure, which was to extricate the
Government from a bad bargain. The record shows that the Government did not
re-auction the respective spectrum in order to strike a better deal. To the contrary,
it reinforced the policy decision by designating the relevant S-band spectrum as
“Defence Band and Defence Interest Zone”. Therefore, the Claimant's
speculation that the CCS and the entire hierarchy of the Indian Government did
not mean what they said in the official decisions and communications should be
rejected.

d. Attribution

329. For the Respondent, the Claimant’s attribution argument adds nothing to the
case. Assurances given by Antrix are assurances given by a legal entity separate
from the Government under Indian law,°®' a fact of which the Claimant was well
aware from the outset. This is so despite the control or supervision exercised by
the Government over Antrix. In any event, the fact remains that the Government
did not commit to refrain from using its sovereign powers in order for the Devas
Project to proceed. Neither did it undertake to issue the necessary licenses and

permits. Therefore, any assurances given by Antrix could not have created a

legitimate expectation that the Government would not take sovereign measures
to the detriment of the Agreement.*5?

3. Analysis

a. Introductory remarks

330. The Tribunal starts its analysis by elucidating the content of the fair and equitable
treatment standard in the BIT. Article 3(2) of the Treaty, entitled “Promotion and
Protection of Investment”, reads as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall accord to investments as well as to investors in
respect of such investments at all times fair and equitable treatment and full
protection and security in its territory.”

331. A threshold question is whether Article 3(2) of the BIT reflects the so-called
customary international law minimum standard of treatment, as the Respondent
argues, or whether it embodies an autonomous and different standard, as the
Claimant submits. The Tribunal observes that the BIT does not refer to
“international minimum standard” or similar formulations, unlike other treaties.°5*
The BIT simply speaks of “fair and equitable treatment”. The question is thus what
“fair and equitable” means.°**

332. In light of the rules of treaty interpretation as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the
VCLT and in particular of the primacy of the text, the Tribunal first notes, like a
number of tribunals, that the plain meaning of the terms “fair and equitable” does

Rejoinder, para. 268.
ane See, e.g., NAFTA, Article 1105, which is entitled “Minimum Standard of Treatment”.

ay The Tribunal further considers that, even if FET were to be equated to the customary
international law minimum standard, the public international law principles concerning the
treatment of aliens have undergone significant developments since the Neer case, on
which the Respondent relies as the applicable benchmark to define FET. In this sense,
see, e.g., ADF v. United States, Award, para. 179, in the context of NAFTA (holding that
“what customary international law projects is not a static photograph of the minimum
standard of treatment of aliens as it stood in 1927 when the Award in the Neer case was
rendered. For both customary international law and the minimum standard of treatment
of aliens it incorporates, are constantly in a process of development”); RDC v. Guatemala,
ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Award, 29 June 2012, para. 218, in the context of the DR-
CAFTA (concluding that the minimum standard of treatment is “constantly in a process of
development”, including since Neer’s formulation). The Tribunal also agrees with the E/
Paso tribunal that this discussion is “somewhat futile’ and “the issue is not one of
comparing two undefined or weakly defined standards; it is to ascertain the content and
define the BIT standard of fair and equitable treatment’. See E/ Paso Energy International
Company v. The Argentine Republic, |CSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October
2011, Exh. CLA-028, para. 335.

not provide much assistance.** The tribunal in MTD v. Chile, for instance,
observed that “[iJn their ordinary meaning, the terms ‘fair’ and ‘equitable’ [...] mean
‘just’, ‘even-handed’, ‘unbiased’, ‘legitimate’”;°°* while the tribunal in S.D. Myers
v. Canada stated that unfair and inequitable treatment meant “treatment in such
an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is
unacceptable from the international perspective” °°’ As noted in Saluka, “[t]his is
probably as far as one can get by looking at the ‘ordinary meaning’ of the terms
of Article 3.1 of the Treaty”.%°

333. In their attempt to ascertain the ordinary meaning of identically or similarly worded
FET provisions in bilateral investment treaties, arbitral tribunals have extracted a
number of elements which they considered inherent components of the standard.
The Tribunal finds it instructive to refer to these previous discussions for its
elucidation of the meaning of FET in the BIT.

334. For instance, the tribunal in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan held that:

“The parties rightly agree that the fair and equitable treatment standard
encompasses inter alia the following concrete principles: - the State must act
in a transparent manner, - the State is obliged to act in good faith; - the State’s
conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic,
discriminatory, or lacking in due process; - the State must respect procedural
propriety and due process. The case law also confirms that to comply with the
standard, the State must respect the investor's reasonable and legitimate
expectations.”

335. The tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine identified similar components as part of the FET
standard:

“whether the State has failed to offer a stable and predictable legal framework;
- whether the State made specific representations to the investor; - whether
due process has been denied to the investor; - whether there is an absence
of transparency in the legal procedure or in the actions of the State; - whether
there has been harassment, coercion, abuse of power or other bad faith

labeled as arbitrary, discriminatory or inconsistent.’°°
336. While formulations have varied across awards and the Tribunal does not endorse

every nuance set out in previous cases, a consensus appears to emerge from
jurispudence about the core components of FET. In line with that consensus and
to the extent relevant to the facts and claims at issue here, the Tribunal considers
that FET includes the protection of legitimate expectations, the protection against
conduct that is arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and lacking in good faith,
and the principles of due process and transparency.

b. Did India’s conduct breach FET?

337. In ascertaining whether India’s conduct was fair and equitable, the Tribunal must
return to the facts reviewed in the context of the essential security interest
defense.**' Not only did these facts not meet the high threshold required to dis-
apply the BIT, but the overall pattern of conduct that emerges from them also
constitutes a breach of FET, as will be seen in the following paragraphs.

338. At the outset, the Tribunal recalls that it did not have the benefit of the testimony
of the Indian officials directly involved in the process leading to the CCS decision,
but was only presented with witnesses having either no personal knowledge or
only peripheral knowledge of many of the relevant events.°° The Tribunal’s
analysis is thus necessarily centered on the documentary evidence which is set

out in the following paragraphs, to the extent it is relevant to the FET analysis.

339. In the Tribunal's view, the facts giving rise to the chain of events leading to the
annulment of the Devas Agreement essentially start on 8 November 2009, when
Mr. Anand received a whistleblower complaint that the S-band spectrum had
been leased to Devas on the basis of corrupt practices.°°* One month later, on
8 December 2009, representatives of the Indian Space Authorities met to discuss
the complaint, as a result of which the Suresh Committee was constituted.°°4

340. Around the same time, on 15 December 2009, at a meeting between the IDS,
MOD and ISRO, the military formulated its requirements for S-band. It is
worthwhile recalling the Tribunal’s findings on this key meeting made above in
respect of the essential security interest defense.°® First, it appears from the
unredacted minutes of the meeting that, in response to ISRO’s indication that
spectrum was limited, the IDS agreed “to explore new avenues’,°© accepted that
it needed “to best utilise available S-band spectrum”, and directed that “deeper
analysis be carried out by the army in consultation with ISRO and BEL and all
necessary modifications are to be included in the GSAT-7S program”.°*” There is
no suggestion in these minutes that the military needs were irreconcilable with
the Devas Agreement. To the contrary, the IDS position appeared to be that its
existing demands could be satisfied by exploring “new avenues’, and that its
future requirements would be satisfied by GSAT-7S (as modified following
“deeper analysis” into frequency re-use). None of the attendees of this meeting —
which included ten persons from ISRO — was presented to testify.

341. The Tribunal further observes that India presented no evidence about the results
of the exploration of these “new avenues” and the “deeper analysis” of the
modifications to GSAT-7S decided at the meeting just discussed. Nor is there any
evidence on record that the result of the military’s “deeper analysis”, if any, was
considered in the decision to annul the Devas Agreement. There is thus no proof
that the military concluded that its existing and future needs could not be met,
e.g. by frequency re-use, the remaining S-band, and the planned military satellite
GSAT-7S.

342. On 4 February 2010, Devas and DT met with Dr. Radhakrishnan and
Mr. Anand.*® At this meeting, Devas made a presentation to the Indian
authorities in which it explained the strategic, societal and commercial
applications of the Devas platform, including services for the railways, security,

stated that a new deadline was set on 1 September 2010 for the launch of the
satellite.6”° No mention was made of the ongoing investigation nor the alleged
crystallization of the military needs. The Tribunal will revert to the significance of
this meeting for the purposes of FET below.°71

343. On 31 May and 1 June 2010, the press published certain reports in which it
discussed the alleged “preferential allocation of spectrum” to Devas, spoke of
“spectrum sold on the quiet”, and suggested that the “agreement should be
annulled [...] so that the Government can raise some more much-needed
money”.°7? It should be recalled that this criticism was made at a time when the
media were extensively discussing the 2G Scandal, which was unrelated to
Devas and which later culminated in the arrest of several former DOT officials,
including the Minister of Telecommunications.

344. The Indian Government took the press reports concerning Devas seriously. On
4 June 2010, Dr. Chandra of the DOT wrote to the ISRO Additional Secretary
asking him to “provide your comments on the news reports immediately [...] kindly
look into the matter personally”.°”?

345. Around the same time, on 7 June 2010, Dr. Suresh transmitted his report (dated
“May 2010”) to Dr. Radhakrishnan, in which he noted the “extremely important”
use of the S-band, as well as the “strategic and other essential needs of the
country” (without further specification). He also pointed to the need to insert into

988 See id., esp. p. 5, discussing the following portfolio of services available under the Devas
System: (i) “strategic” (i.e., “Railways: Real time location information and support for
collision avoidance”; “Security: Secure satellite communications in remote areas”;
“Emergency: Reliable, resilient communications for national threats and disaster relief”);
(ii) “societal” (i.e., “Rural: Enabling personalized interactions in remote and
underdeveloy ; “Public health: Improving health awareness through access to
information”, ducation: Enabling personalized learning through access to new
curricula”); and (iii) “commercial” (i.e., “Multimedia: Information and entertainment content
and applications”; “Interactive Data: Connection to the Internet and other interactive
applications’).

the Devas Agreement a clause giving preference to ISRO in case of a demand
for use “under emergent conditions for strategic or any other essential
applications” and to revise the “severe” penalty provided in the contract for delays
in the delivery of the satellites. Because of these latter factors, the report
concluded that the Devas Agreement needed to be ‘“re-visited” taking into
account, among other aspects, the “importance of preserving the spectrum for
essential national needs”.°”4

346. Dr. Suresh’s recommendation was as follows:

“The utilization of the S-band frequency spectrum allotted for satellite based
services to ISRO/DOS for satellite communications is extremely important.
Therefore this aspect has to be critically examined considering all usages
including GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A by a competent technical team on high
priority. The strategic and other essential needs of the country should also be
considered.”°’5
347. The Tribunal notes that nowhere in the report did Dr. Suresh recommend that the
Agreement be annulled, which was also acknowledged at the hearing by

Mr. Anand.°”6 Instead, Dr. Suresh suggested an amendment of the contract.5””

348. A week later, on 14 June 2010, the DOT had still not received any reply from
ISRO in respect of the press reports. The Secretary of the DOT, Mr. Thomas,
thus wrote to Dr. Radhakrishnan, referring to the DOT’s letter of 4 June and
requesting him “to kindly look into the matter personally and expedite your
comments”.°”® The escalation within the hierarchy in the administration shows the
level of concern over the matters raised in the press reports.

349. Dr. Radhakrishnan reacted to this letter within 48 hours and sent two almost
identical memoranda to the DOT Secretary,9”° and the Advisor to the Law
Minister,?®° requesting “whether” the contract needed to be annulled in order to

“preserve the precious S band spectrum” and ensure a level playing field for other
service providers.°8"

350. It is notable that, despite Dr. Suresh's recommendations, Dr. Radhakrishnan
rushed to ask the Ministry of Justice “whether” the Agreement needed to be
annulled. There is a dispute on the meaning of “whether” in Dr. Radhakrishnan’s
memorandum to the MOJ. For the Tribunal, Dr. Radhakrishnan was seeking
advice about how to annul the Agreement, i.e. he wanted to identify a legally
permissible basis for terminating it. This is also how the MOJ understood the
request. In reply to Dr. Radhakrishnan’s request, it provided legal advice on the
possible basis for terminating the Agreement, rather than any policy advice as to
“whether” the Agreement needed to be annulled. This understanding is also
confirmed in the subsequent Space Commission Note, which recounted the steps
taken by the DOS and stated that the latter had “decided to request [the] Ministry
of Law and [J]ustice to give its opinion as to how to annul the contract”.*8? The

ICC tribunal reached the same conclusions.3*

351. Atthe hearing, Mr. Anand confirmed that, following receipt of the Suresh Report,
and in the space of 10 days, “there was a discussion Dr. Radhakrishnan had with
a few people and then he arrived at a conclusion or a decision based on that”.5°4
Importantly, Mr. Anand also confirmed that in these (undocumented) discussions
nobody consulted with the MOD.*® Similarly, there is no evidence before the
Tribunal that the DOS or Dr. Radhakrishnan inquired about the outcome of the
“deeper analysis” to be carried out by the military as directed at the 15 December
2009 meeting to consider other avenues for their S-band requirements in view of
the limited spectrum available. The Tribunal will revert on the implications of this
lack of evidence below.38

352. On 18 June 2010, the Advisor to the Law Ministry provided his reply to
Dr. Radhakrishnan, suggesting that “in exercise of its sovereign power and
function [...] [the Central Government] take a policy decision” in order for Antrix
to be able to invoke the force majeure clause.*®” He remarked that he “ha[d] been
told” by Radhakrishnan in a meeting “that new strategic needs have been [sic]

emerged which require accommodation in the spectrum”.*8°

353. Shortly thereafter, on 30 June 2010, the DOS Additional Secretary drafted the
“Note to Space Commission” to prepare the meeting that would take place a few
days later, the purpose of which was “to apprise Space Commission on certain
concerns that have arisen’, and on “the imperative demand [...] for strategic and
societal applications that have emerged”.%®° In discussing the alleged military
needs, the Note referred to the minutes of the meeting of 15 December 2009,
which were attached.29° The Note did not explain whether the military had
“explore[d] new avenues” as decided by the IDS. The Note also mentioned other
“demands” from “Internal Security Agencies viz. BSF, CISF, CRPF, Coast Guard
and Police”,?*" “requirements projected by Indian Railways for train-tracking”;29?
and “national communication, dissemination of disaster warnings, tele-education,
tele-health and rural communication”,°® all of which were merely asserted,

without any further explanation nor substantiation.

354. Furthermore, the Note also referred to other concerns, such as the “existence on
record of a few anomalies that suggest that full information has not been provided
to Cabinet and Space Commission”™ and the fact that “DEVAS, which has a
large foreign equity, can assign or sell or sub-licence any and all of its rights under

this agreement: without any approvals from ANTRIX, the security implications

that can arise as a consequence, would need serious consideration” .2%>

355. The Note essentially listed three reasons why legal advice had been sought from
the Law Minister on “how” to annul the contract:

“Considering all these facts it was decided in the Department of Space that:

(i) in order to give priority to the demand for fulfillment of strategic
requirements that have been received at DOS [...], which is in tune with DOS's
stated policy as seen by DOS's correspondences with various fora of Govt.

L.-J

(ii) due to the opaqueness being seen in the preliminary examination of the
documents in hand [...] of Antrix-Devas contract which would suggest, inter-
alia, that the non exclusiveness to be ensured while allotting S-Band to private
players was not observed; and,

(iii) considering the fact that Dept of telecommunications had not been
consulted over a service that includes terrestrial connectivity and the
implications thereon including denial of a level playing field,

it was decided to request Ministry of Law and [JJustice to give its opinion as to
how to annul the contract.”"9%

356. After reviewing these grounds, the Note concluded that it was “inevitable” to annul
the Agreement, in the following terms:

“15.1 Annulling the Contract: Considering the need (i) to preserve S-band
spectrum for national requirements in strategic sector and for societal
applications, (ii) certain concerns on technical, managerial, financial and
contractual aspects of ANTRIX-DEVAS contract, and (iii) issues involved in
DEVAS obtaining the Spectrum License for the proposed services, (para 13.2
j refers) it would be inevitable to annul the ANTRIX-DEVAS contract.’99”

357. On 2 July 2010, the Space Commission met*** and directed the DOS to instruct
Antrix to annul the contract. The minutes of that meeting refer to strategic and
societal needs, however without any substantiation. Notably, they also mention
other concerns, in particular the alleged lack of transparency and the fact that
some contractual terms were perceived as unduly favorable to Devas. A few
months later, one of the attendees at this meeting, Cabinet Secretary

Mr. Chandrasekhar, gave the following account on the annulment to the Prime
Minister in a note marked “secret”: “[...] since the agreement has now had to be
cancelled on account of reasons related to non-transparency and one-sided skew
in risk sharing arrangements, ISRO / DoS are left with a satellite [...] which has
no immediate commercial application” .5°°

358. The Tribunal finds it significant that, in his official summary to the highest political
organ of the state, one of the attendees in the key meeting in which the annulment
was decided named these two reasons for the annulment and none other. In the
absence of any evidence to the contrary from anyone present at the Space
Commission meeting, the Tribunal considers that Mr. Chandrasekhar's account
can be taken as a fair characterization of the principal basis for the annulment
decision. Yet, these reasons were not those later alleged to justify the annulment.

359. To the contrary, all later documents up to the CCS decision place greater
emphasis on the strategic and societal needs as the reasons for annulment.
Thus, when Dr. Radhakrishnan requested a further opinion from the Additional
Solicitor General, he referred to the fact that “[s]ubsequent to signing of this
agreement, the Government has received a lot of demands from various wings
of the Government for allocation of S band spectrum to them to meet up the
strategic and societal requirements of the nation”.4°° He did not substantiate or
otherwise explain these needs. Neither did the ASG inquire about them. Instead,
he recommended to invoke force majeure in order to give “greater legal sanctity
to the decision to terminate the contract”.4"

360. On 16 February 2011, Radhakrishnan sent a “Note to CCS” to “seek approval of

CCS for annulling the agreement” “in view of priority to be given to nation’s

strategic requirements including societal ones” .4°?

361. The following day, on 17 February 2011, the reasons cited in the CCS decision
for the annulment of the Agreement were the “national needs, including for the
needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other public utility services
as well as [...] societal needs’ and “the needs of the country's strategic

requirements” .4°

362. The Tribunal draws two main conclusions from the evidence just reviewed. First,
the decision to annul the Devas Agreement was not based on facts and was the
result of a flawed process. Second, if the Agreement as it was then framed had
been irreconcilable with military and societal needs, quod non, the Indian
authorities should have engaged with Devas to seek a solution, which they failed
to do. These two conclusions are set out in more detail in the following
paragraphs.

363. First, the decision to annul the Agreement was arbitrary and unjustified inasmuch
as it was manifestly not based on facts, but on conclusory allegations, and was
the product of a flawed process. Dr. Radhakrishan’s course to rush to the
annulment after the press reports, which as a cascade effect triggered all the
other subsequent actions, was taken without any documentary evidence, sound
justification, or record. It was further in conflict with the recommendations of the
Suresh Committee that Dr. Radhakrishnan himself had set up to review the
matter. Indeed, the Suresh report called for a ‘critical examination” by a
“competent team’. Yet, there is no evidence that any such examination was ever
performed; Dr. Radhakrishnan precipitated the outcome by aiming for the most
extreme solution (the annulment) and then seeking to justify it ex post. It is clear
from the evidence reviewed above that when Dr. Radhakrishnan first wrote to the
DOT and the Ministry of Justice for advice, he had already decided that the
Agreement should be annulled, and was only seeking the “best” way to go about
it (“how’).494

364. In particular, as far as the military needs are concerned, it is true that there had
been military “demands” from 2005 to 2009. However, the outcome of the
“crystallization” of these needs in December 2009 was that the military was to
search for other avenues. Yet, the record does not show whether that search

even took place, what its results were, and whether it was considered in the
decision to annul the Agreement. There is no evidence that the military had

reached the conclusion that its needs could not be met.

365. The fact that the minutes of the December 2009 meeting do not show the
existence of essential military needs is confirmed by the absence of any follow
up action. Indeed, no military needs were put before the 115th or 116th meetings
of the Space Commission or elevated to the Space Secretary.4°5 The Tribunal
has difficulty in following the suggestion of one of India’s witnesses that all those
attending at the December 2009 meeting on behalf of DOS/ISRO were
negligent.*°° Neither is there an indication that those present from the IDS
elevated the matter within their hierarchy, which one would expect had there been

any essential military needs.

366. It is also important to note Mr. Anand’s testimony that, in preparing his report,
Dr. Suresh received input from two DOS attendees of the 15 December 2009
meeting, Mr. Sayeenathan and Ms. Varadhan. Mr. Anand further stated that
Dr. Suresh could have received the documents regarding strategic needs that
pre-dated this meeting from Ms. Varadhan and thus “he would have looked at all
the strategic needs”.‘°” Thus, if military needs justifying annulment had existed,
Dr. Suresh would have ascertained them from the direct sources and
incorporated them into his recommendations. However, Dr. Suresh did not do so;
neither did he recommend annulment.

367. Furthermore, even assuming that a rational policy existed, namely the need to
protect military needs, the Tribunal considers that there was no appropriate
correlation between the asserted public policy objective and the measure
adopted to achieve it,#°® as the course of action chosen conflicts with the

needs to be an appropriate correlation between the state's public policy objective and the
measure adopted to achieve it. This has to do with the nature of the measure and the
way it is implemented” (para. 10.3.9). See also Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands)

recommendations of the committee entrusted with reviewing the issue for that

specific purpose.

368. Turning now to the so-called “societal needs”, the Tribunal cannot but conclude
that there is nothing in the record documenting these needs. Not only are there
no reports from any governmental office or agency substantiating these needs,
not even the demands from the relevant authorities have been produced. The
Tribunal is simply faced with bare assertions of categories of needs, which start
to appear in the documents around the time when Dr. Radhakrishnan comes to
the conclusion that the Agreement should be annulled. The timing of these
assertions is critical and their mere repetition in the documents leading to the
annulment without any explanation, content, or justification for the types of needs
listed does not lend credibility either to the process or the purported justifications.

369. By contrast, the record does evince that the appearance of the proclaimed military
and strategic demands and societal needs coincided with the unfolding of the
unrelated political scandal involving the corrupt sale of terrestrial spectrum in
India, and with the manifestation of personal animosities within the DOS towards

the Devas Agreement.

370. In particular, starting from 2009, there was a concern that Devas had acquired
valuable spectrum for too low a price. At various junctures, the press focused on
this concern in the belief that the Devas-Antrix deal could reveal a political
scandal similar to the 2G Scandal,*°? which concerns were taken very seriously
at least by certain arms of the Indian Government, in particular within the DOT,
as recalled above.*!° Within the DOS there was also a belief that Devas had

acquired the spectrum in a non-transparent or opaque fashion*‘' — “on the sly” as

(holding that “unreasonable” conduct would require “a showing that the State's conduct
bears a reasonable relationship to some rational policy”).

India’s witness Mr. Anand testified.“'? There were further concerns about certain
commercial terms of the Devas Agreement which were perceived as too onerous
to the Indian party, in particular the penalties for delays in satellite deliveries.**>
The various reports also refer to the preoccupation that there was no control over
a possible assignment of the Agreement.‘ Finally, there was a further worry that
there was no “level playing field” so far as terrestrial operators were concerned,
as it emerges from Dr. Radhakrishnan’s letters.415 As already observed, it is
significant that the “secret” note to the Prime Minister mentioned the lack of
transparency and the one-sided clauses in the contracts, but made no mention
of other reasons that were officially brought forward in the CCS decision.*'° As it
has already noted, the Tribunal has no reason not to accept that this note reflects

the principal factors behind the annulment of the Agreement.

371. The post-annulment facts corroborate the conclusion that there were no military
needs which were irreconcilable with the Devas Agreement. As already
discussed in the section on essential security interests,” the discussion within
the Government on the use of spectrum continued for almost four years,
culminating in the Cabinet decision of 21 January 2015. The Tribunal has already
highlighted the significant areas of uncertainty arising out of the only document
on record on the final spectrum allocation, i.e. the half-page document contained
in Exh. R-43.47

372. In addition, before that decision, the DOT was heavily agitating in favor of a
commercial use of the spectrum. The Tribunal notes that there are almost no
documents on record as to the DOT’s communications to the Cabinet or the DOS

in or before early 2015 concerning its change of position on the use of S-band
spectrum.‘'® The Tribunal has difficulty in following the testimony that the DOT,
after battling for years, communicated its decision to relinquish its demand for S-
band worth billions of dollars simply by placing telephone calls to Mr. Anand42°
and Mr. Sethuraman.*!

373. Besides the oral testimonies that the GSAT-6 satellite was eventually launched
and is used for strategic and societal purposes,‘”* the Tribunal has not been
presented with any documents evidencing the actual and planned usage of that
and of the other S-band satellites. At the hearing, Mr. Anand referred to an
S-band “utilisation plan” in response to a question from the Tribunal.4”? He then,
however, backtracked when it came to questions seeking to elicit a copy the

“Q. The first question comes out of a question put to you by Professor Stern. She was
asking you a question about MSS uplink and downlink, and she was asking: ‘So for what
use now is the downlink of MSS? Is it not used? You said it's uplink MSS, downlink BSS.
So what is the purpose of the downlink of MSS?’ And you answered: ‘No, no, no. That
will all get used in the upcoming satellites. So the entire spectrum -- there is a utilisation
plan for using the spectrum from end to end. So what we do is: GSAT-6, 6A, 7S, all these
have to be allocated spectrum.’ So my question is simply about the utilisation plan that
you referred to. That utilisation plan would show to us precisely how the spectrum is
planned to be utilised, | presume?
A. Any utilisation plan will tell you how it's going to be utilised.
Q. Is that a utilisation plan that you've seen, | presume?
A. No, | have not seen. | have only heard about the utilisation from the experts.
Q. Okay. Where would the utilisation plan be? Would it be with DOS? | presume it would
be. Is that correct?
A. The person in charge of utilisation of spectrum is sitting right here, Mr. Sethuraman,
so he would know better.
Q. Right. So he would be able to provide a copy of that utilisation plan for the Tribunal?
A. | didn't say there is a document. | said there is an utilisation plan. It would be disjointed;

there won't be one single document, (a), (b), (Cc), (d). It would be scattered across various
documents relating to various satellites.

374. In the presence of documented needs, the Tribunal would not second-guess the
Government's decision to adopt a certain course of action. The difficulty here is
that the assertions found only in documents prepared with a view to the
annulment decision do not constitute such evidence. The fact that the annulment
decision was not backed by evidence in support of the reasons invoked is a
strong indication that these reasons were not well-founded.

375. The Tribunal comes now to its second conclusion deriving from the review of the
record. Even if there were proof of any military and societal needs irreconcilable
with the Agreement, quod non, the Tribunal is of the opinion that it was incumbent
upon India to raise the issues it had identified in the Agreement with Devas/DT.4°
Despite the fact that the Devas platform appeared to cater for the possibility to
offer various services, the Indian authorities made no attempt to engage with
Devas/DT to examine whether and how these services could accommodate the
public needs that had allegedly arisen. At no time after Dr. Radhakrishnan had
come to the conclusion that the Agreement needed to be annulled did Devas/DT

get the opportunity to explain, fix, amend, or try to meet the concerns asserted.

376. What is more, not only did India fail to engage with a view to attempting to reach
an acceptable solution with its counterparty or an amendment of the Agreement
(as recommended by Dr. Suresh), but it positively misled the investor on a
number of occasions. On 4 February 2010, after the alleged military demands
had crystalized at the 15 December 2009 meeting,*#° Devas and DT met with
Dr. Radhakrishnan and Mr. Anand.4?’ As already recalled, at this meeting, Devas
made a presentation to the Indian authorities in which it explained the strategic,

societal and commercial applications of the Devas platform, including services

Q. So he would be able to gather together those documents to demonstrate to the
Tribunal how the various satellites you've referred to are going to be utilised; is that
correct?
A. That question should be directed to Mr. Sethuraman, if he can produce such a
document.”

for the railways, security, emergency and disaster relief, health and education.4°
It is undisputed that no reference was made to the ongoing investigation nor to
the crystallization of the military needs at this point in time. The Tribunal finds it
particularly difficult to understand why no mention was made to Devas/DT of the
allegedly competing military needs. If irreconcilable military needs had indeed
arisen, as India argues, this incompatibility with the Agreement should have been
communicated to Devas and DT.

377. In this respect, the Tribunal does not share India’s position that the very nature
of the subject matter pertaining to national security prevented it from sharing
information with the investor. India did not need to disclose sensitive or classified
national security information, but could simply have advised Devas/DT in general
terms that the military needed some of the spectrum, thus allowing the investor
to be aware of the situation and act accordingly.429

378. In the Tribunal’s view, the failure to engage in a dialogue with Devas/DT is
particularly troubling under the circumstances for a number of reasons. With
regard to the alleged military needs, the preponderance of the evidence before
this Tribunal establishes that throughout the years the military constantly
asserted needs for MSS spectrum,*° while the Devas-held portion of the
spectrum was BSS spectrum. Even after the annulment, in the context of the
EGOM proceedings and the discussions between the DOT and DOS, the DOS
stated unequivocally that “[sJervices in S band will be used by strategic and

ae See ibid., esp. p. 5, quoted supra at footnote 369.

a The Tribunal shares the observation by the Mauritius BIT tribunal on this point. See
Mauritius BIT Award, para. 469 (‘It would be to no avail for the Respondent to argue that
such strategic information could not be communicated to the Claimants. Indeed, the
required disclosure would not entail informing the Claimants of the nature of those needs
or revealing any secret information. The Respondent could and should have simply
informed the Claimants that the Agreement was in jeopardy because of societal and
strategic needs; it would then have been up to the Claimants to decide how much financial
and other resources they were willing to put at risk in that context or to propose to the
Respondent possible alternative solutions”).

government services and the requirement is only for MSS [...]’.441 The same
request for MSS spectrum is evident from a letter of September 2012 from the
Armed Forces to ISRO.*%2 The Tribunal cannot follow Mr. Anand’s explanation at
the hearing that this letter, authored by an Air Vice Marshall and Chairman of the
Integrated Space Cell (Armed Forces), was “a pretty incompetent letter’.49° A
dialogue with Devas/DT could have clarified whether the Agreement could be
amended instead of wholly annulled.

379. Moreover, Devas showed on numerous occasions that it had applications that
could potentially be used to cater for India’s strategic and societal needs. As was
already mentioned above in relation to the 4 February 2010 meeting and as will
be further highlighted below, these potential functions were presented on several
occasions to departments within the Indian Government, including those most
closely related to security, such as the National Security Advisor and the National
Security Council (“NSC”) Secretariat. There is no indication on record that India
even considered any of these services. In fact, India has not alleged that the use
of the Devas System was ever reviewed for its ability to meet strategic and
societal needs, or that means other than the outright annulment were considered.

380. Atthe 4 February 2010 meeting referred to above, instead of informing DT/Devas
of possible threats to the Agreement, Secretary Radhakrishnan stated that a new
deadline was set for the launch of the satellite on September 2010.4*4 The lack of
transparency is manifest. At the same time, the Government was both telling
Devas that the satellite would be launched and taking steps towards the
annulment of the Agreement. Not only did it not disclose relevant facts, it actually
concealed them by affirmatively creating a misleading impression of the status of

the project. The Tribunal is struck by the failure to provide Devas/DT with due

process at that time, especially given the drastic outcome that was contemplated.

381. The lack of transparency continued and, even worsened thereafter. After the MOJ
had provided its advice on 18 June 2010, on 22 June 2010 Devas and DT met in
Delhi with Mr. Menon, India’s National Security Advisor, who was also a member
of the Space Commission. At this meeting, Devas and DT presented once again
the strategic and societal applications available under the Devas System.*%°

Again, no mention was made of the Agreement being in jeopardy.

382. As was recalled above, on 2 July 2010, the Space Commission decided to revoke
the spectrum and annul the Agreement, a decision that was not conveyed to
Devas or DT.

383. One month later, in August 2010, Devas met again with the Secretariat of the
NSC and explained how its services could be used by the user agencies
represented in the NSC, including proposals to develop the Devas Defense
Network.4%° Later that month, on 27 August 2010, Devas presented its services

to the Joint Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office.49”

384. At none of these meetings were any military requirements mentioned nor, to the
extent some of these meetings took place after 2 July 2010, was DT/Devas
informed that the Government had made the decision to annul the Agreement.4%8

385. In October 2010, DT’s Chief Technology and Information Officer Mr. Kozel
traveled to India and met with the Minister of State Chavan (who had attended
the 2 July 2010 Space Commission meeting).“*° No reference was made then to
the Space Commission's decision to annul the Agreement or to competing
military demands for Devas’s S-band. According to Mr. Kozel’s contemporaneous

frequencies not being auctioned” and suggested that a commission would in the
future be appointed to review the situation. Mr. Kozel’s report expressed the
confidence that a satellite launch would be scheduled in the first quarter of 2011
and that DT’s investments were not at risk.44°

386. Thereafter, as was explained at the hearing, DT and Devas continued work to
prepare for the launch of GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A satellites over the second half
of 2010.44" In particular, Devas submitted a draft WPC licence to Antrix and
communicated with ISRO’s frequency management office to finalize the
application.442, DT also conducted a successful second round of experimental
trials in Germany (August 2010) and China (October 2010).‘4? Dr. Larsen testified
at the hearing that these trials would not have happened if the annulment decision
had been communicated to Devas/DT.*44

387. The lack of transparency and forthrightness is manifest. The Indian authorities
continued acting as if the project were on track and it was business as usual,
when in fact the contract had been annulled. As a result, DT and Devas continued
to take active steps towards the realization of the project. In other words, after
the annulment was decided, Devas and DT were affirmatively misled and made
to believe that the project was alive when in fact it was dead.

388. The decision to revoke the spectrum and annul the Agreement was finally
communicated to Devas/DT through the CCS decision of 8 February 2011, i.e.
more than seven months after it had been taken by the Space Commission. The
Tribunal agrees with the Mauritius BIT tribunal which held that:

“if the Respondent had acted in good faith, it would have informed the
Claimants about the decision of the Space Commission of 2 July 2010 to annul

the Agreement. Unfortunately, nothing of the sort occurred; in fact, the

completely left in the dark about the Space Commission’s decision and the
alleged growing needs of the military and their possible impact on the
Agreement.445

389. In conclusion, India acted in “wilful disregard of due process of law” through
conduct “which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety”, to use
the words of the ICJ in ELS/, to which both Parties have referred .446

390. For all of these reasons, the Tribunal finds that India’s conduct did not comply
with the fair and equitable treatment standard in multiple respects. It barely needs
noting that all of the acts reviewed by the Tribunal and giving rise to an unlawful
conduct, including those of the DOS, ISRO, and the CCS, are attributable to India
as they were performed by organs of the State within the meaning of Article 4 of
the ILC Articles. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal can dispense with
examining whether India also breached DT’s legitimate expectations, as it would
make no difference to its finding that an FET breach occurred.

391. Inthe second phase of this arbitration, the Tribunal will assess the harm caused
by India's actions in breach of FET as identified above.

B. EXPROPRIATION

392. The Parties diverge on whether India’s measures constituted an expropriation
and, if so, whether the expropriation complied with the requirements set by the
BIT for a lawful taking.

1. The Claimant’s position

393. The Claimant submits that India’s measures constituted both direct and indirect
takings. In particular, India directly expropriated the contractual rights under the
Devas Agreement, which resulted in indirect deprivation of DT’s shares in Devas.

a. Indirect expropriation

394. DT claims that India indirectly expropriated its shares in Devas and its in-kind
contributions to Devas by annulling the Agreement and thereby rendering DT’s
investment worthless. Although Devas may have some small amount of cash left

in the bank, bankruptcy is not a pre-condition for expropriation. What matters is
that India’s measures prevented “any further implementation of Devas’s business

plan”.47

b. Direct expropriation

395. The Claimant further submits that India directly expropriated Devas’s contractual
rights under the Agreement. The effect of India’s measures was to bring the
Agreement and the Devas Project to an end. In a similar case, the ADC v.
Hungary tribunal concluded that the measure, which “had the effect of causing
the rights of the Project Company to disappear and/or become worthless”
constituted an expropriation.*48 In this regard, the Claimant refutes the following

arguments made by India.

396. First, the fact that India was not a party to the Devas Agreement is irrelevant,
since it is undisputed that India intervened to annul the Agreement using its
sovereign power. That fact reinforces the Claimant's argument that the
annulment of the Agreement was an extra-contractual measure, which in the

words of Bayindir v. Pakistan “is by definition an act of ‘puissance publique” .44°

397. Second, contrary to India’s contentions, the Agreement was not subject to further
approvals. It entered into force after “Antrix through ISRO/DOS” obtained the
necessary orbital slot and frequency clearance, as was confirmed by the ICC
Award.*©° The absence of the WPC License does not alter the fact that the
Government expropriated Devas’s rights under the Agreement. According to DT,
India fails to “explain how any uncertainty surrounding the eventual issuance of
the WPC License required in light of the terrestrial segment of the business, which
was not subject of the Agreement, could mean that the Agreement did not give
rise to acquired rights in respect of the lease of satellite capacity and S-band

spectrum that was its subject matter”.‘5' In fact, the ICC Award confirmed that the
Agreement gave Devas the exclusive right to lease 7OMHz of S-band and Devas
was the only entity capable of using that spectrum terrestrially.4°? This contradicts
India’s submission that Devas had no acquired rights under the Agreement.

398. Third, India may not rely on the contractual defenses under Articles 7 and 11 of
the Agreement in order to avoid responsibility under the Treaty. By its own
assertion, India is not a party to the Agreement and therefore it cannot raise
contractual defenses. In fact, the ICC Award rejected Antrix’s attempt to invoke
Articles 7 and 11 of the Agreement to justify the annulment.*®* Moreover, if the
contractual defense of force majeure based on a governmental act excused a
state from liability under an international treaty, “then contracts governed by
municipal law could never be the basis for ‘acquired rights’ protected by an
investment treaty”.4°* In any event, even if India could invoke contractual
defenses, here they would be “fictitious” or based on pretext. Investment tribunals
usually disallow attempts to exercise a contractual defense that was “merely a
pretext designed to conceal a purely expropriatory measure”.45>

399. Therefore, India’s sovereign decision to annul the Agreement constituted a direct
expropriation of Devas’s acquired contractual rights.

Cc. Unlawftulness of the expropriation

400. Article 5 of the BIT requires an expropriation to be “in the public interest’,
“authorized by the laws of’ the host State, “on a non-discriminatory basis” and
“against compensation”. For DT, it is undisputed that these conditions of
lawfulness are cumulative. Because India’s expropriation failed to satisfy those
criteria, DT submits that the expropriation was unlawful.

401. As to the requirement of compensation, the Claimant argues that there has been
no offer, let alone a payment of compensation. Antrix's offer to refund the Upfront
Capacity Reservation Fees was manifestly inadequate, since the BIT requires
“compensation which shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated or
nationalized investment’. In addition, the ICC Award dismissed Antrix’s argument
that it only owed the Upfront Capacity Reservation fee to Devas.*® India’s failure
to provide compensation is in and of itself sufficient to render the expropriation

unlawful.457

402. The Claimant further contends that India expropriated its investments in a
discriminatory manner. In particular, DT relies on the fact that the Government's
alleged policy decision to reserve S-Band for strategic purposes left untouched
the 40 MHz of S-band leased to the Government-owned operators. It is the
Claimant's view that this is a clear case of a measure affecting a foreign investor
and not domestic investors in like circumstances.

403. The Claimant also argues that India’s measures lacked a public purpose. The
relevant case law shows that a mere invocation of “public interest” does not
satisfy the treaty requirement in this respect.*°° As argued in connection with FET
and India’s essential security interests defence, the Government acted with
ulterior political and commercial motives when annulling the Agreement.
Furthermore, the public purpose requirement implies that the expropriatory
measure be proportionate,*®° which it was not.

404. Therefore, the Claimant considers that the expropriation of DT’s investment was
illegal on multiple counts.

2. The Respondent’s position

405. The Respondent argues that the expropriation claim is meritless. It submits that
the measures that DT challenges were not expropriatory and were, in any event,
in full compliance with Article 5 of the BIT.

a. No expropriatory measure

406. According to India, “a protected property right is the sine qua non of an
expropriation’.4°° Neither Devas nor DT had any protected right under the
Agreement that could be expropriated, since the implementation of the Devas
Project required Governmental approvals, which had not been obtained. Any
contractual rights that Devas had under the Agreement had not materialized by
the time the CCS took the decision to disallow the allocation of the relevant

spectrum for commercial use.

407. India submits that, in a similar situation where the government had not issued a
necessary renewal of broadcasting rights, the tribunal in Emmis v. Hungary held
that there was no “property right or asset ... vested (directly or indirectly) in the
claimant for him to seek redress”.4°1 Accession Mezzanine v. Hungary took the
same stand dismissing the expropriation claim where “the Claimants did not have
a property right, contractual right or any other vested legal right in Hungarian law
in relation to the exploitation of a national radio frequency in Hungary on the
critical date of the alleged expropriation” .*°

408. The Respondent refutes DT’s argument that the uncertainty surrounding the
WPC License did not alter the existence of Devas’s contractual rights to the
spectrum. In making this argument, so says the Respondent, the Claimant
assumes that the WPC License was required only for the terrestrial and not for

the satellite component of the project. This assumption is wrong, given that

“...Devas could not provide any services — including satellite-only services (the
subject of the purported ‘acquired rights’) — without a WPC operating license”.46°

409. India finds it irrelevant that the Government may not invoke contractual defenses,
such as force majeure, to excuse itself from treaty breaches. Indeed, India is not
invoking force majeure as an excuse. What matters is that the Agreement on
which DT relies as the purported basis for the acquired right to implement the
Devas Project did not provide for such right, since the contractual obligations
were expressly excluded where they contravened sovereign decisions.4®4 Thus,
in the Respondent's submission, DT’s direct expropriation case fails as a matter
of law because the Claimant has identified no property right which may give rise

to an expropriation claim.

410. For the Respondent, there is no room either for a claim of indirect expropriation,
since Devas remains under the management and control of DT Asia and other
shareholders, and has in fact pursued its claims in the ICC arbitration and
obtained an award in its favor. In any event, the shares in the local company do
not constitute a relevant investment for purposes of the expropriation claim, as
the dispute does not relate to the deprivation of the shareholders’ rights. In CVE
v. Czech Republic, invoked by the Claimant in this regard, the situation was
different; the tribunal found there to be “substantial accrued legal rights”, including
a TV broadcasting license, which formed the basis of an operating business.4®

411. Insum, so argues India, its measures were not expropriatory as they did not affect
rights capable of being expropriated.

b. Lawfulness of the expropriation

412. In the alternative, if India’s measures were found to be expropriatory, India
opposes the view that the alleged expropriation was unlawful. It disputes DT’s
submission about non-compliance with the conditions for a lawful expropriation,
namely compensation, non-discrimination and public purpose.

413. First, as to compensation, the Respondent submits that an offer or a payment of
compensation is not a pre-requisite of legality. As the Tidewater v. Venezuela
tribunal held, where there is a genuine dispute about the expropriatory nature of
the measure, “an expropriation wanting only a determination of compensation by
an international tribunal is not to be treated as an illegal expropriation”.4°°

414. Second, regarding discrimination, India emphasizes that DT does not and cannot
claim that it was discriminated based on nationality. In any event, the portion of
S-band leased to the Government-owned operators is an inappropriate
comparator, since “the referenced 40 MHz of S-band is not similarly situated to
the satellite S-band spectrum [...] and could not be used effectively for strategic
purposes”.467

415. Third, the Respondent also challenges the Claimant's position that the measure
lacked a public purpose. In support, it refers to the arguments raised in respect
of the essential security interests and of FET. In addition, it stresses that the CCS
decision expressly stated that it was reserving S-band for strategic purposes due
to “an increased demand for allocation of spectrum for national needs, including
for the needs of defense, para-military forces, railways and other public utility
services”.4°° The Claimant's allegation that this decision did not mean what it said
and was “a contrivance designed to extricate Antrix from the Devas Agreement”
is “irresponsible” and “cannot be taken seriously”.4°°

3. Analysis

416. The Tribunal has concluded above that India’s conduct breached the FET Treaty
standard in multiple respects. As a consequence of the acts which the Tribunal
has deemed contrary to FET, the Devas Agreement was annulled. As far as
expropriation is concerned, in essence DT claims that by unlawfully annulling the
Devas Agreement India expropriated its contractual rights, which resulted in an
indirect deprivation of DT’s shares in Devas. For reasons of judicial economy, the

Tribunal can dispense with addressing these claims, since even if the same facts
were found to also constitute an expropriation, the ensuing damages would not

be greater.

c. FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY
ts The Claimant’s position

417. DT contends that “in the absence of any express limitation in the treaty” the
obligation to accord full protection and security contained in Article 3(2) of the BIT
“is not limited to physical security’.4’° In this sense, it overlaps with the FET
standard.*”' Therefore, for DT, India’s conduct described above in relation to FET
also breached the full protection and security standard contained in Article 3(2)
of the BIT.472

ae The Respondent’s position

418. According to the Respondent, the full protection and security clause “only protects
physical security of foreign investments”, irrespective of a specific mention of
physical security in the clause.4”? This standard “is not a substitute for a
stabilization clause” and it is undisputed that India made no stabilization
commitment. As a result, the claim for violation of Article 3(2) is ill-founded.

3. Analysis

419. Forreasons of judicial economy, given its holding on FET, the Tribunal dispenses
with addressing the Claimant's FPS claim, as any resolutions of this claim,
assuming it were well-founded, would not change the outcome of the dispute in

terms of quantification of damages.

iii. its costs for travel and other charges in the sum of USD 116,850.79.

423. As the case will continue to the quantum phase, the Tribunal considers it more
appropriate to defer its decision on the apportionment of the costs to such phase.
