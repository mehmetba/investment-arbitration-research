INTRODUCTION
A. THE DISPUTE AND THE PARTIES

The Parties’ dispute concerns Claimant’s alleged investments in Peru, including the Santa Ana silver
mining project and the alleged associated legal and contractual rights. Claimant contends that
Respondent has failed to afford Claimant’s investment in Peru the protections set out in the Free
Trade Agreement between Canada and the Republic of Peru (“FTA”).' Respondent contests the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction and argues that Claimant’s claims are unfounded on the merits.”

Claimant in this arbitration is Bear Creek Mining Corporation (“Bear Creek”), a company duly
incorporated under the laws of Canada, with its headquarters located at 625 Howe Street, Suite 1050,

Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 2T5.

Respondent in this arbitration is the Republic of Peru (“Peru”), a sovereign state with an address for
service as Dr. Ricardo Ampuero Llerena, President, Special Commission Representing the Republic
of Peru in International Investment Disputes, Ministry of Economy and Finance of Peru, Jr. Cuzco

177, Lima, Peru.

B. THE TRIBUNAL’S TERMINOLOGY AND REASONING

The Tribunal has sought to make a consistent use of terminology. This does not reflect the Tribunal’s
understanding of a particular issue or a propensity to the views of one or the other party. Likewise,
the order in which sources or references are presented is not intended to reflect a particular source’s
value. Instead, effort has been made to list the arguments, in the Tribunal’s view, in a logical fashion
and to format the footnotes consistently so as to reference all relevant exhibits presented by the

Parties.

The Tribunal has given careful consideration to the extensive factual and legal arguments presented
by the Parties in their written and oral submissions. The Tribunal has also reviewed the submissions

from amicus curiae and from the Government of Canada. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary

to reiterate all such arguments, but rather addresses those arguments which it considers most relevant
for its decisions. The Tribunal’s reasons, without repeating all the arguments advanced by the Parties,
address what the Tribunal considers to be the determinative factors required to decide on the requests
of the Parties. The Tribunal considers, however, that a brief repetition of certain aspects of its

conclusions in the context of particular issues is appropriate.

General of ICSID. ICSID transmitted the RfA to Respondent on August 13, 2014.

Respondent to stay the MINEM Lawsuit while this arbitration is pending.*

The First Session of the Arbitral Tribunal was held on January 12, 2015. An audio recording of the
session was made and deposited in the archives of ICSID and distributed to the Members of the
Tribunal and the Parties. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that

no party had any objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal.

During this session, the President referred procedurally to Claimant’s Request for Provisional
Measures and invited the Parties to propose a procedural schedule. The Parties agreed that
Respondent would file a response on February 6, 2015, and that this response would be followed by
a second round of submissions, with Claimant’s observations to be filed on February 20, 2015 and

Respondent’s rebuttal on March 6, 2015.

On January 14, 2015, the Tribunal Secretary, on behalf of the Tribunal, emailed the Parties the

procedural schedule, as agreed by the Parties during the First Session.

On January 27, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO-1”), which contains a
summary of the Parties’ discussions at the First Session. Annex | to PO-1 contains the procedural

schedule for this arbitration.

On February 6, 2015, Respondent filed Respondent’s Response to Claimant’s Request for Provisional
Measures (“R.Prov.M.-I’). Respondent requested that the Tribunal deny Claimant’s request for
provisional measures or, in the alternative, that “the Tribunal expressly confirm that, if the issue of
the questionable validity under Peruvian law of Claimant’s acquisition of the concessions is
presented to it as part of the Parties’ jurisdictional or merits arguments, the Tribunal will hear and

decide those issues.”*

On February 20, 2015, Claimant filed Claimant’s Observations to Peru’s Response to the Request for
Provisional Measures (“C.Prov.M.-II”). Claimant repeated its earlier request for relief and made the

further request that “/i/f the Tribunal were to deny Bear Creek's request for provisional measures,

Bear Creek requests the Tribunal to confirm that Bear Creek's continued defense against Peru’s

On February 27, 2015, Respondent filed English translations of exhibits R-001 — R-005.

On March 6, 2015, Respondent filed Respondent’s Rejoinder on Claimant’s Request for Provisional

Measures (“R.Prov.M.-II”). Respondent repeated its earlier request for relief.

Simpson as Tribunal Assistant.

On March 27, 2015, pursuant to section 11.4 of PO-1, Respondent filed English translations of

against Peru’s claims against Bear Creek in the MINEM Lawsuit before
the Peruvian courts does not constitute a violation of the waiver
requirements set forth in Article 823.1(e) of the FTA.

3. Any decision regarding the costs caused by this procedure on provisional
measures is deferred to a later stage of the proceedings.

Parties to address the following questions in separate sections of their respective Post-Hearing Briefs:

2.1.4 In separate sections of the brief, any comments the Parties have regarding the
following questions of the Tribunal (which are without prejudice as to the final
relevance given by the Tribunal to such questions and the comments received):

a) What is the standard by which the Tribunal is to determine whether Claimant
sufficiently reached out to the relevant communities needed to obtain a Social
License?

i. Which national and international legal provisions are applicable to
informing that standard?

ii. Insofar as the State authorities have any discretion in this regard, what are
the limits?

iii. What actions were legally required of Claimant in seeking to obtain a
Social License, and did the Claimant take these actions?

iv. In the present case, what were the State authorities’ responsibilities in
relation to obtaining a Social License?

Vv. As a matter of law, what are the consequences that follow from an absence
of support on the part of one or more relevant communities, or parts
thereof, in relation to this investment?

b) Did the Claimant make all required disclosures in making its application for a
Public Necessity Decree? If not, what are the consequences for this case, including
for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal?

co) What was the basis for the decision to issue Supreme Decree 032, and on what
evidence did the State authorities rely?

d) Of the two reasons relied upon by Respondent for Decree 032, could that Decree
also have been legally issued, if only one of the two reasons could be established:

i. only the alleged illegality of the Claimant’s Application?
ii. or only the unrest as it existed at that time?
e) What are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if
it were to conclude that:
i. the Claimant's alleged investment was lawfully expropriated?
ii. the Claimant's alleged investment was unlawfully expropriated?
iii. Respondent breached its obligations under the FTA for FET or other
obligations under other provisions of the FTA?

iv. if the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had contributed to the social
unrest that occurred in the spring of 2011 — by act or omission - how should
such a contribution be taken into account in determining matters of
liability and/or quantum?

SUNARP registered the Power of Attorney for Ms. Villavicencio as legal representative for Claimant

in certain matters on August 21, 2003.7

122. In 2000, Apex Silver Mines Corporation requested a Public Necessity Decree for a series of border-

zone concessions that Respondent believes to be the same as those later requested for the Santa Ana
Project. At the time, the Peruvian military opined that the Santa Ana investment did not constitute a
public necessity due to concerns of security and national defense.”* The Parties dispute whether this

denial was due to Apex being a Bolivian company.”*

123. In 2004, Claimant became aware of the existence of potential silver ore deposits in Santa Ana, located

within 50 kilometers of the border between Peru and Bolivia.”

124. Respondent regulates the activities of foreigners in border regions. Pursuant to Article 71 of the

Peruvian Constitution, aliens are not permitted to “acquire or possess under any title, directly or
indirectly, mines, lands, woods, water, fuel or energy sources, whether it be individually or in
partnership, under penalty of losing that so acquired right to the State.”> A foreign national can
only gain rights to natural resources in border regions when the foreign national makes a case to the
Peruvian Government for a “public necessity”, which must be expressly determined by an executive

decree approved by the Council of Ministers in accordance with the law.?”

125. The Parties dispute the effect of a foreign national’s application for a public necessity Supreme

Decree. Claimant explains that mining rights in Peru are granted to those who first request them,
thereby generating the risk that, by applying for the Supreme Decree, Claimant would alert Peruvian
individuals and companies to the existence of potential mineral deposits, thereby enabling them to
obtain the corresponding rights before Claimant.”* Respondent, however, states that Claimant could
have acquired the concessions by applying for them in its own name and then submitting the request
for concessions, which would have paused the concession application until either Claimant obtained
the public necessity decree or affirmatively abandoned its claim to the concessions. In doing so,
Claimant would have maintained its priority vis-d-vis the concessions, but would have had to wait

until the Article 71 Supreme Decree process had completed.”

126. Claimant states that, in order to maximize its chances of ultimately securing the mining rights related

to these deposits, Claimant agreed with Ms. Villavicencio that she would secure these mineral rights
while Claimant requested and until it obtained the authorization required under Article 71 of the
Peruvian Constitution.” Respondent characterizes this as Claimant using Ms. Villavicencio to act as

a front to hold the concessions for Claimant.*!

127. The Parties dispute whether (1) Ms. Villavicencio claimed the Santa Ana concessions in her own

individual capacity as a Peruvian citizen, (2) Claimant specifically disclosed the nature and extent of
Ms. Villavicencio’s employment with Claimant when applying to the Government for the Supreme

Decree required under Article 71 of the Peruvian Constitution, (3) the Option Agreements that

Claimant and Ms. Villavicencio were registered with the public registry, Respondent knew that these
Option Agreements were between Claimant and its employee.*” The Parties also dispute whether Ms.
Villavicencio was contractually or otherwise obligated to follow Claimant’s instructions with respect

to the concessions.**

128. From May to November 2004, six mining petitions corresponding to the Santa Ana Project area were

Miguel Grau, a partner at Estudio Grau, is a member of Claimant’s board.**

129. Claimant and Ms. Villavicencio recorded the Option Agreements with the Peruvian Public Registry
in 2005.*” Initially, the INACC cancelled the mining claims and Ms. Villavicencio appealed.** On
June 28, 2005, the Option Agreements were submitted for registration to SUNARP.* In July 2005,
SUNARP refused to register the November 17, 2004 Option Agreement, citing Article 71 of the

Peruvian Constitution.“” Claimant challenged this decision before the SUNARP Registry Tribunal.*!

130. On November 7, 2005, the SUNARP Registry Tribunal decided that the Option Agreements could be
recorded.” The Parties dispute the legal value of this event. Claimant states that SUNARP’s an
administrative decision confirmed that the 2004 Option Agreements were valid under the Peruvian
Constitution because they did not entail a transfer of legal rights until Claimant would decide to
exercise its options under said agreements.** Respondent disputes the SUNARP Registry Tribunal’s
authority to create or affirm substantive rights and states that the SUNARP Registry Tribunal only
has the authority to publicly register documents that meet certain technical requirements.** The

Parties dispute whether the Option Agreements conferred indirect ownership rights.**

B. SUMMARY OF FACTS PRESENTED BY AMICI AND PARTIES’ RESPONSES

The following summary of facts is based on the Amici submissions and the Parties’ responses thereto.
It is presented without prejudice as to the relevance of these facts for the decisions of the Tribunal.
For the avoidance of repetition, the Section above does not indicate where Amici agree with a Party

that an event occurred — rather, this section only addresses “new” facts submitted by Amici and the

 

Parties’ responses to these. In addition, this section presents the Parties responses to the Tribunal’s

questions, as the Parties addressed them. Below, Claimant’s arguments in relation to the Tribunal’s
question (a) “What is the standard by which the Tribunal is to determine whether Claimant sufficiently
reached out to the relevant communities needed to obtain a Social License? (iii) What actions were
legally required of Claimant in seeking to obtain a Social License, and did the Claimant take these
actions?”?"" are presented, as are Respondent’s arguments in relation to the question “Which national

and international legal provisions are applicable to informing that standard?”?'*

1. Summary of Facts Presented by DHUMA and Dr. Lépez
Amici’s summary of their first submission is best taken from their own words:

1. [...] Bear Creek did not do what was necessary to understand the doubts, worries
and anxieties and the Aymara culture and religiosity, and did not do the necessary
to identify and assess the risks that their own operations could entail for the
population and their rights over their lands and water. The company acted as if it
were sufficient to promise benefits to some of the people and communities in the
areas surrounding the project, to hold public meetings announcing their plans
without needing to work closely with the communities, listening to their doubts and
comments, explaining that the risks were minimal (if they truly were minimal), or
that there would be benefits (if there really were). The actions that Bear Creek
failed to carry out do not involve a simple strategy of community relations but
correspond to international standards that Bear Creek should have known about
and complied with but did not.

 

2. Based on their own sources, conversations with the population itself and databases,
the Amici can affirm that the communities, particularly those not directly affected
by the project, in the districts of Huacullani, Kelluyo, Zepita, Desaguadero,
Pisacoma and others, believed that Bear Creek was not being transparent and
sincere with them, and that it was doing everything possible to carry out its project
without regard to the concerns or opinions of the population. In those
circumstances the communities felt compelled to fight to preserve their territories,

27 PO-10 F 2.1.4 (a)(iii).
28 Id, at {2.1.4 (ali).

ICSID ARB/14/21 53

their land (the Pachamama) and their sources of water, all of them necessary for
their lives. If Bear Creek had approached the situation differently, perhaps the
situation would also have been different.

3. [...] Bear Creek did not obtain the social license to develop its project at the time

and at present still does not have it. [...] there is no legitimacy, trust or consent of

the parties. The conflict started due to a lack of transparency and misinformation

on the part of Bear Creek (or Mrs. Villavicencio), a lack of respect for the peasant

communities and respect for the rights of indigenous peoples. The population’s

frustration and anger only abated when the Santa Ana project was cancelled.?"°

219. The districts of Huacullani and Kelluyo in the province of Chucuito are the two districts most directly
affected by the Santa Ana Project. In Huacullani, 80.5% of the population is rural and 89.2% lives
in poverty. In Kelluyo, 82% is rural and 79.4% lives in poverty. Approximately 80% of the
population are native Aymara speakers and, although they state that they speak Spanish, they are not
fluent in Spanish, especially with regard to professional or technical terms.””° The peasant
communities in the south of Puno are made up of people that ethnically and culturally belong to the
Aymara group. Their principal economic activities are agriculture, fishing, and livestock farming.

They are aware that mining has impacted these kinds of activities in other parts of Peru.?”!

220. In 2000, the province of Chucuito had no mining concessions. By 2011, it had 59. Thus, the province
and population were not familiar with mining activities and did not have much information regarding
mining. This unawareness and lack of information generated distrust and rejection of mining

activities.”??

221. The Santa Ana Project was the first mining project to be developed in the south of Chucuito.
Although the Project began in 2002, the authorities in Huacullani first began to be aware of the Project
in 2004, when Ms. Villavicencio held a meeting with the mayor of Huacullani to request support for
the annulment or resizing of the Lupaca Reserve, for mining. Ms. Villavicencio introduced herself

as the owner of the concession, but actually did not obtain the mining titles until 2006. The

information given in the meeting was misleading and confusing and Ms. Villavicencio never
explained her relationship or intentions with Claimant. In 2008, most of the population knew about
this and this provoked a widespread rejection of mining projects, especially the Santa Ana Project.
Claimant failed to obtain the approval of the population for its then-current and future operations, and
created distrust, misinformation, and conflict in the communities.””> This led to the social protest in
the Aymara peasant communities during 2011, one of the central demands of which was the repeal
of Supreme Decree 083.774
222. Due to their ever-increasing fears and suspicions, a large number of people from peasant communities
held a meeting on October 14, 2008 to speak with Claimant’s representatives about the Santa Ana
Project. Claimant’s representatives did not attend the meeting, so those present decided to go to the
Santa Ana mining camp. On the way there, their anger grew. This incursion ended with part of

Claimant’s mining camp being burned and destroyed.??>

223. In Aymara culture, the act of receiving a gift creates a moral obligation of reciprocity. A Lieutenant
Governor remarked to DHUMA that Claimant's staff “had made personal invitations to communal
authorities in their homes, offering them gifts such as bread and fruit” and that these authorities were

226

reciprocating by attending the presentation of the ESIA.

224. On February 23, 2011, there was an information workshop on the ESIA, which DHUMA members
attended. During the event, the population sought to clarify doubts about the Santa Ana Project.
None of their doubts regarding social, environmental, or cultural impacts of the Project were
dispelled. In addition, the building where the meeting was located was too small for many interested
people to participate. Less than half of the number of people recorded actually attended. Participants
were also turned off by having to register at the entrance and when doing so, receiving a gift bag
containing a poncho and a cap with the company logo. Many did not understand the consequences
or implications of registering. Hundreds of people were unable to participate and, thus, inhabitants

protested and suggested that the workshop could be held in the main square in Huacullani so that they

could participate. This request was denied.”’ It is estimated that between 400 and 500 people who
could not participate inside at the meeting protested the Project outside, worried about contamination

228

to land and water.”

225. The ESIA presentation was given in Spanish and used technical language. The translation into

Aymara was poor. Claimant required that questions from participants be made in writing and in
Spanish, which is not common practice in the Andean world, where daily communication is oral and
in Aymara. This made it difficult for participants to express their views. When people did raise
questions in oral form — questions related to contamination and to benefits from mining — the answers
were highly technical and were poorly translated. During the hearing, many people expressed their
distrust for the company. Although those present who opposed the Project were relatively quiet and

did not interrupt the hearing or show their anger, it was clear that they were against the Project.”

226. The Aymara have a deep respect for mother earth (Pachamama) and it is their responsibility to protect

her. Concerns regarding change to the natural landscape, the integrity of their territories, and the
negative effects on their sanctuaries and culture could not be attended at the presentation. These
concerns, however, were shared by other communities that form part of the districts of Kelluyo,
Pisacoma, Desaguadero, Zepita, and others. The possibility that the mining Project — an open pit —
would have an impact on water was a great concern. Peru is concerned about water scarcity and the

Aymara population depends on water resources.?°”

227. Already in 2008 and 2011, a company was responsible for respecting all human rights and, as part of

207

228

229

that responsibility, it had the obligation to obtain consent of the local population to its operations in
order to ensure its own sustainability.”*! Claimant knew or should have known about these human

rights standards, but either ignored them or failed to put them into practice.” The concept of a

“social license” is closely related to the responsibilities of business enterprises to respect human
rights. For a social license to exist, there must be legitimacy, trust, and consent — none of which

existed or exist with regard to the Santa Ana Project.

228. As aresult of the hearing on the ESIA, a number of communities decided to start a protest movement

against mining in general and, particularly, against the Santa Ana Project.?** The indigenous socio-
environmental protest — the “Amyarazo” — began in March 2011. The Aymara population demanded
repeal of Supreme Decree 083, application and respect for the right of prior consultation, and
suspension of all mining concessions in southern Puno. Mr. Aduviri acted as a spokesman for the
deep dissatisfaction and concern that already existed in the population due to information regarding
other mining projects and the lack of information and transparency with regard to the Santa Ana
Project. The protests took place away from the Santa Ana Project so that the protesters would be
heard. DHUMA’s role in the protests was to promote peace and non-violence. The protests would

235

not end until the Santa Ana Project was cancelled.

229. Currently, 18 of the leaders that participated in the protests are under criminal investigation.”

230. After the Hearing and with the Tribunal’s permission, DHUMA wrote to the Tribunal in response to

233,

statements made by Claimant. DHUMA confirmed its Amici submission and offered to provide
copies of supporting documents and objects — including the ponchos and caps received at Claimant’s
2011 public hearing — to the Tribunal. DHUMA conveyed the continuous and profound concern of
the Comunidades Campesinas of Puno about the development of the Santa Ana Project and other
mining projects in the Puno region, and the risk that those will contaminate the environment and

threaten the existence and culture of indigenous communities.*”

2. Claimant’s Response to Amici Submission and Tribunal’s Question (a)

231. According to Claimant, DHUMA is a non-governmental organization that publicly expresses its
radical anti-mining agenda, without reservation. Since DHUMA representatives have refused to
appear as witnesses in these proceedings, Claimant will not have the opportunity to cross-examine
them and the Tribunal will not have the opportunity to assess the veracity of their claims. The

Tribunal should, therefore, not give any weight to the Amicus Submission.?**

232. Amici’s account of the events that took place surrounding the development of the Santa Ana Project
does not represent the views and opinions of the Aymara people and does not reflect the truth of what
actually occurred, as demonstrated by contemporaneous documentation and evidence. Claimant
engaged in meaningful and extensive community relations programs and complied with its

obligations under international and Peruvian law, as the Government of Peru confirmed at the time.”

233. Contrary to Amici’s insinuation, Claimant did not bribe any members of the indigenous communities

and did not offer gifts to create an obligation of reciprocity.”

234. Amici’s description of the February 2011 public hearing is simply untrue and is at odds with the
detailed testimony of Mr. de Mayolo, who attended the hearing. The hearing was held at the largest
available locale. Respondent’s list of participants shows that at least 729 community members
attended. Claimant set up a canopied area with chairs, giant screens, and speakers, more than
doubling the venue’s capacity. This enabled people who were not registered to see and hear all of
the presentations and questions. There was no contemporaneous indication that the venue was
insufficient. The translation was provided by a well-known Aymara professional who had provided
interpretation services in other workshops. There were no restrictions on questions being asked orally
or in writing and questions were accepted in Spanish and Aymara, and were translated accordingly.

DHUMA’s claim that there were many cases in which certain individuals were not allowed to speak

or ask questions is unfounded and DHUMA has failed to indicate who has been prevented from
speaking. It is unclear from where DHUMA has gathered its “facts” and it is unclear what basis
DHUMA has for alleging that there was a deep feeling of dissatisfaction in most of the attendees at
the public hearing. Claimant provided statements of other community members who were unaware
of discontent. There is no support for DHUMA’s contention that there was a demonstration of 400

or 500 people following the hearing. Ci ‘aneous ion issued by R

 

indicates the opposite — it confirms that the public hearing “ended satisfactorily.”**!

235. Claimant is internationally recognized for its commitment to developing harmonious and respectful

relations with the communities neighboring its projects. Amici’s account of the events surrounding
the Government’s enactment of Supreme Decree 032 would have this Tribunal believe the opposite.
Claimant engaged meaningfully with local communities and obtained their support for the Santa Ana

242

Project.

236. Even if Amici’s description of events was accurate, it implicates conduct of Respondent and not of

241

Claimant. According to Amici, it was Respondent’s grant of a large number of mining concessions
in the territories of the indigenous communities that triggered an anti-mining sentiment in the
population of Puno. Even if Amici’s allegations regarding failed communication about the grant of
mining concessions to Ms. Villavicencio or the issuance of Supreme Decree 083 were true, it would
be evidence of Respondent’s failure. Respondent is responsible for informing its citizens of State
decisions, acts of public administration, and their effects. If Respondent was required but failed to
consult with local communities before granting rights over their lands, either by awarding the Santa
Ana mining concessions to Ms. Villavicencio or by issuing Supreme Decree 083, and if Respondent

failed to inform these communities after it granted these rights, then any resulting fallout from this

lack of communication and transparency falls on Respondent, not Claimant. Ms. Villavicencio

followed the procedures set forth under Peruvian law for applying for the mining concessions, and

Claimant followed the mandated procedures for obtaining a declaration of public necessity.”

237. The Aymarazo highlights the local population’s dissatisfaction with the Government, although Amici
try to blame events on Claimant. Throughout, Amici repeat their position that the protests were
intended to engage Peruvian authorities. On the Amici’s own account, the protests were spawned by
the failures of Respondent and sought to attract Respondent’s attention. The political, anti-
Government nature of the protests is also confirmed by the looting and burning of various public
institutions in Puno on May 26, 2011. The political nature of these protests was confirmed by

President Alan Garcia and Prime Minister Rosario Fernandez.

238. In response to the Tribunal’s question (a)*“*, Claimant explained that, when Claimant acquired the
Santa Ana Concessions, there was no provision of Peruvian law providing any standard by which
either the State or local communities could grant a “social license” with respect to a mining project.
Respondent then developed a “Citizen Participation Process”, through which the State and the
mining company share information about the Project with local communities who may then voice
their concerns to the State and the company.” Respondent, through DGAAM, was responsible for
guiding, directing, and conducting the Citizen Participation Process and for ensuring that the local
communities fully participate in the process.*4” Claimant followed the applicable Peruvian legal

framework and Respondent approved of its activities, as evidenced by MINEM’s endorsement of

did not inform Claimant of any concern it may have had regarding community relations in Santa

Ana.2?

239. Amici have failed to identify any concrete violations of specific legal requirements or standards.
Amici’s blanket statement that Claimant failed to engage in a positive relationship with surrounding
communities ignores Claimant’s outreach programs and efforts, which Respondent approved and
certified as being in compliance with applicable standards and legal requirements. Supreme Decree
028-2008-EM (“Supreme Decree 028”) and Ministerial Resolution No. 304 regulate how Claimant
was to develop and implement its CPP. Article 4 of Supreme Decree 028 incorporated ILO
Convention No. 169. Respondent’s DGAAM approved the Executive Summary of Claimant’s ESIA
and Claimant’s CPP, by which Claimant proposed community participation mechanisms for
continued interaction with local communities. Both were prepared in accordance with Peruvian

mining regulations. Dissatisfaction with these processes is properly raised with Respondent, not

Claimant.*°

240. Supreme Decree 028, which regulates the citizen participation process, imposes responsibilities on

the Government, not on the investor. The State enjoys a certain amount of discretion when

request information, reject participation mechanisms it deems unsuitable, or demand that the

company hold additional workshops. 7

In these proceedings, several witnesses testified that
Respondent failed to meet the requirements of Supreme Decree 028. DGAAM refused to attend some
of Claimant’s workshops, citing budgetary constraints. Mr. Flury’s view was that Respondent had
abandoned Claimant, with the consequences that we see now. The scant presence of the State in the

region contributed to the conflictive situation.**

241. ILO Convention 169 imposes direct obligations on states only. Contrary to Respondent’ s arguments,
a private company cannot “fail to comply” with ILO Convention 169 because it imposes no direct
obligations on them. The Convention adopts principles on how community consultations should be
undertaken, but does not impose an obligation of result. It does not grant communities veto power
over a project. The only relevant inquiry is whether the consultations were conducted in good faith,
adjusted to the circumstances of the Project and the affected community, and conducted with the

objective of reaching agreement.?™*

242. Recognizing that social support is fundamental to the successful execution of a mining project,
Claimant devoted considerable efforts and resources toward forging a respectful relationship with
local communities and exceeded government requirements.**° Amici fail to address that Claimant
exceeded the requirements of domestic and international law, organizing five participatory workshops
to introduce indigenous peoples to the Santa Ana Project before the preparation of the ESIA began
and again during the preparation of the ESIA, where Ministerial Resolution No. 304 only requires
one. From 2008 — 2011, Claimant held over 130 workshops in 18 communities to engage them with
the Santa Ana Project and employed over 100 community members. Claimant regularly informed

DGAAM of these activities and DGAAM visited the Project area to monitor Claimant’s relationship

with the communities.*° Contrary to Mr. Ramirez Delpino’s statement, however, neither the

Regional Directorate of Energy and Mines (“DREM”) nor MINEM ever informed Claimant of any
concerns they may have had regarding the workshops.’ Claimant’s other efforts included
participative monitoring and school campaigns, setting up an Office of Ongoing Services at the Santa
Ana campsite to field queries, and distributing informational materials — in print and through radio —
to inform communities about the Santa Ana Project.** In response to Respondent’s allegation that
Claimant was not upfront with communities about its role at the start of the Project, as Mr. Ramirez
Delpino testified, communities care more about a mining project’s size than the identity of its

owners.”

243. Claimant defined the areas of direct and indirect influence in its Executive Summary of the ESIA and

sent this to DGAAM for review.” When Claimant submitted its ESIA for review on December 23,
2010, the OEFA reported that Claimant enjoyed a harmonious relationship with communities.”°!
DGAAM approved the CPP and the Executive Summary of the ESIA on January 7, 2011, determining
that the citizen participation mechanisms were “appropriate to the particular characteristics of the

mining activity area of influence [...]."** Critically, this means that Respondent determined that the

DGAAM outlined the next steps that Claimant would need to undertake for a public hearing to occur.
Claimant had complied with all requirements by January 21, 2011 and, with DGAAM’s authorization
and support, proceeded to hold the public hearing on February 23, 2011.7** By all contemporaneous

accounts, including from MINEM, the hearing was a success.”

Respondent’s own poraneous di and 266 If DGAAM had believed that
further information needed to be communicated to the communities to alleviate any concerns, it would
have ordered Claimant to hold additional workshops after the hearing.”*” Since Respondent has failed
to produce its video of the public hearing, the Tribunal should give no weight to the biased, after-the
fact accounts of the public hearing, including the reports submitted by Dr. Pefia Jumpa, who did not

attend the hearing.”

244. After the hearing, Claimant continued its community relations program and, on April 19, 2011,
DGAAM noted that Claimant had implemented all of the citizen participation mechanisms that were
to be carried out during the ESIA evaluation phase, as set forth in the CPP.” The local communities

supported the Santa Ana Project. Claimant signed agreements with the communities, formalizing

their support and the company’s commitment to (1) provide jobs, (2) assist communities in the
development of sustainable projects, and (3) respect the indigenous people’s way of life. Community
members independently expressed their support for Claimant and the Santa Ana Project. In March
2011, representatives of the Huacullani District denounced FDRN protests and the March 20, 2011
ordinance purporting to prohibit all mining activities in the Department of Puno. Prior to
Respondent’s enactment of Supreme Decree 032, the Peruvian Government supervised and endorsed
Claimant’s community relations program for the Santa Ana Project every step of the way. Even after
Respondent issued Supreme Decree 032, members of the communities asked OEFA about when the
Santa Ana Project would return. Local authorities wrote to the Peruvian Government requesting the
return of the Project. Community members maintain that Claimant’s community relations programs

were successful.?”

it had identified in its December 2006 Supreme Decree Application, Claimant states that it worked

Claimant to conduct additional workshops but did not.*’* Respondent has a duty to guarantee the

right of consultation of indigenous communities. Mr. Delpino’s testimony confirmed that this right

is guaranteed with the implementation of the CPP.?”

Claimant’s Project was small and run-of-the-
mill: while there would be a spike during construction of around 1,000 jobs, it was only going to
create 157 permanent jobs in year | of operations and, over the life of the mine, only 141 jobs.
Consistent with the manual from MINEM, Claimant thus concentrated their outreach near the

communities closest to the Project and so as not to create false expectations for those further away.?”*

247. The Tribunal must view Claimant’s social license to operate in light of the contemporaneous

c ion.” The cc ip sus de ion shows that the protests were not against
Claimant’s activities, but were orchestrated for political reasons by Walter Aduviri, for the

cancellation of all mining.?”°

248. As even the First Specialized Constitutional Court of Lima confirmed, Claimant did not instigate the

249. Nevertheless, as a matter of law, the absence of local support for a mining project does not vitiate or
otherwise undermine Respondent’s grant of a declaration of public necessity. At most, a lack of
support entitles the Government to require the concession holder to undertake additional community

outreach.?”

250. There is, however, a third option: if the Tribunal finds that Claimant did not have a social license, it
can find that it was prevented from obtaining the same by Respondent’s own wrongdoing.
Respondent never gave Claimant a chance to continue its community outreach efforts to strengthen
the social license it had already obtained, after the protests began. The suspension of Claimant’s
ESIA prevented Claimant from continuing to implement its community relations program in Santa

Ana.2°

3. Respondent’s Response to Amici Submission and Tribunal’s Question (a)

251. According to Respondent, the DHUMA Submission presents a new perspective on two central points
of dispute: (1) whether Claimant caused or contributed to the social unrest that engulfed the Puno
region and (2) whether Claimant lived up to international norms for interactions with indigenous

communities. DHUMA is clear on both points: Claimant failed to obtain approval of the local

population for its current and future operations and, through its own actions, contributed to distrust,
misinformation, and conflict in the communities.*! The summary of Respondent’s response to the

DHUMA Submission is best taken from its own words:

The DHUMA Submission, as a voice for the affected Aymara communities themselves, is a
helpful resource for the Tribunal as it evaluates Claimant's conduct and its contributions
to the events of 2011. DHUMA’s Submission testifies directly to Claimant’s insufficient
social outreach and the dire consequences that that failure had for Claimant’s Santa Ana
project. From the beginning, Bear Creek's interactions with the communities have been
defective, due to their myopic focus on delivering limited benefits to only those communities
whose land Bear Creek needed to directly occupy for its project. Bear Creek ignored, or at
the very least failed to address sufficiently, broadly held community concerns about
environmental contamination and availability of scarce water resources. The DHUMA
Submission makes it clear that Claimant failed to comply with international standards or
to acquire the social license necessary to operate a large-scale mining project. DHUMA
explains that the result of Claimant's conduct was that the Aymara communities rebelled
violently against Bear Creek’s presence in the Puno region. The DHUMA Submission is
therefore a critical portion of the record before this Tribunal as it assesses Claimant's
conduct.**?

252. As DHUMA explained, it has worked directly with the Aymara communities for nearly 30 years.
DHUMA’s daily interactions with the Aymara communities make it uniquely qualified to understand
the communities’ rejection of the Santa Ana Project, and place it in a position to explain this rejection
to the Tribunal. DHUMA staff also participated in the February 2011 public hearing and DHUMA’s
President, Sister Patricia Ryan, was in the city of Puno during the 2011 protests and actively sought

to keep the Aymara protests peaceful and non-violent.?*>

253. The DHUMA Submission shows that Claimant caused the social unrest in Puno when it failed to
alleviate community concerns about environmental degradation. From the outset, Claimant created
a climate of misinformation and distrust in various groups of the Aymara communities in the area.
This is clear from DHUMA’s description of a May 18, 2004 meeting between Ms. Villavicencio and
Huacullani authorities to discuss re-sizing the Aymara Lupaca Reserve. This distrust and
misinformation continued and, according to DHUMA, several communities were unaware until

February 2008 that their territory would soon be occupied by a mining company. DHUMA confirms

that after the acquisition became known in October 2008, members of the communities sought

dialogue with Claimant’s representatives. When these requests were ignored, community members

travelled to the Santa Ana campsite where they threatened Claimant’s employees and set fire to the

campsite. The DHUMA Submission makes it clear that, from the outset, Claimant failed to assuage

community concerns about the presence of a large-scale mine on community lands.”*4

254. The DHUMA Submission contradicts Claimant’s assertion that it received overwhelming support
during the February 2011 public hearing. DHUMA representatives attended this hearing and reject
Claimant’s assertion. DHUMA explains that many of the attendees were present only out of cultural
and moral obligation. During the hearing, Claimant distributed a gift bag containing a hat and a
poncho with the company’s name on it to attendees, thereby generating a sense of obligation to stay
and listen. DHUMA explains that the population was uneasy and worried about the development of
the mining Project, and this unease manifested itself at the hearing. There were questions related to
community concerns about environmental contamination, and linguistic barriers likely suppressed the
number of questions asked. DHUMA’s representatives who attended the meeting speak Aymara and
witnessed attendees commenting about not trusting what the company was saying and voicing
concern about harm. After the hearing, several communities wrote to regional and national authorities
to express concerns about the public hearing and their opposition to the Santa Ana Project. The
hearing apparently served as a catalyst for Aymara community action against the Santa Ana

Project.*° To the extent that Claimant argues that they have a video showing local support, such a

255. DHUMA confirms that the protests in 2011 were directly related to the Santa Ana Project. This is
evident from the protestors’ demands, as well as from the protests not stopping until after Respondent
issued Supreme Decree 032. The fact that the protests occurred in Puno and Desaguadero — the cities
closest to the Santa Ana Project site — rather than on the site itself does not mean they were unrelated.
DHUMA explains that the protests took place in the largest cities in order to capture the attention of
the regional and national authorities for maximum impact. Mr. Aduviri was simply a spokesman for
the communities’ broadly held anger for the Santa Ana Project — while he may have helped organize
the community movement, he did not create it. The protests had broad community opposition to the
Santa Ana Project as their foundation. DHUMA personnel experienced first-hand the severity of
social conditions in Puno and describe these food and water shortages and how this unsustainable
crisis in Puno was a critical reason for the Council of Ministers’ issuance of Supreme Decree 032.78*
256. DHUMA and Dr. Lépez are experts in public international law and international human rights, and
DHUMA also works to put international human rights law into practice. DHUMA and Dr. Lépez
explain that Claimant failed to live up to international standards for community engagement and, as
aresult, Claimant failed to obtain the necessary social license for an extractive project of this nature.
The internationally-accepted concept of the “social license” aligns closely with the requirements
under Peruvian law. It is clear that Claimant failed to comply with internationally recognized norms,
including the 2008 UN Framework and Guiding Principles and Convention 169 of the ILO. It was
Claimant’s responsibility to address community concerns. It is irrelevant whether their concerns were

based in sound scientific or technical evidence — it was Claimant’s job to educate and to correct

257. Inresponse to the Tribunal’s question (a)””’, Respondent explained that, as Claimant has recognized,
a company obtains the necessary social license if and only if it is generally accepted by the relevant
communities. The sufficiency of a company’s efforts to obtain this license is not measured by the
procedural steps it follows or the minimum legal requirements it fulfills; rather, the license must

actually be obtained and maintained. The sufficiency of a company’s outreach is measured by the

291

standard of success. It is not a question of discretion of the State.*' Procedural steps — be it the

carrying out of 130 workshops, organizing a rotational work program, or completion of other
procedural steps cannot substitute for actually obtaining a social license.””? Here, Claimant did not
have “general acceptance” from the relevant communities — it did not have a social license.?°*
Although Claimant tries to narrow the scope of “relevant communities’, its approach misunderstands
the Aymara communities’ collective social organization.”* The protestors were not outside agitators;

they were community members who objected to Claimant’s presence in the area, to its Project, and

258. Since the social license is a de facto acceptance of the Project, there are few legal standards that can

296

be applied to it. None of the international or national instruments supplies a formula that guarantees
that such a license will be obtained. Rather, some procedures are recommended.”*° ILO Convention

169 promotes a transparent, effective and integrated consultation process by giving communities the

 

right to be Ited (Article 6), di ding that cc ities’ cultural relationships with their land
will be respected (Article 13), and stating that communities have the right to participate in the use,

Respondent to specifically safeguard the communities’ ability to make decisions about the resources

focuses on the quality of communication, ensuring that a company can only proceed with the consent

of the communities. The CPP process is not a simple matter of ticking boxes or fulfilling certain

259. Peruvian law incorporates the above described international standards and requires that a company

undertake community outreach to build healthy relations with the communities. The legal
requirements, such as in Legislative Resolution No. 26253 of 1993, do not dictate a strict or specific
path for a company to seek a social license.*” The citizen participation process for a mining project
is covered by 2 principle legal norms: Supreme Decree 028 and Ministerial Resolution No. 304.
These set out the necessary — but not sufficient — steps toward securing a social license.*' In 2001,
MINEM published a Guide advising on best practices for designing and executing a community
outreach program to develop mining activities.*” In 2011, Peru adopted the “Law on the Right to
Prior Consultation to Indigenous Peoples, Recognized in Convention 169 of the International Labor
Organization”, which adopted all of the recommendations of ILO Convention 169.*°* Finally, in
addition to these procedures, the company must reach agreements with all land owners and possessors
on the mine sites. Here, that would amount to 99 agreements.*** That the DGAAM reviewed
Claimant’s CPP and did not instruct Claimant to expand upon it is not proof of the plan’s sufficiency

to obtain a social license.*”°

carried out consultations, they were not performed in a climate of mutual trust. Claimant was not

upfront about its role or that of Ms. Villavicencio, leading communities to reject the Project in part

because they did not trust the company.*°°

whether Claimant addressed the communities’ concerns. Records indicate that more information and
better ways to communicate that information were needed. Communication was also overly technical

those that are within the discretion of State authorities when faced with a situation where a mining
project does not have a social license or (2) those under the FTA if the Tribunal finds that Claimant
did not have a social license.*'® Regarding the first class, and as experts from both Parties confirmed,
when a community or important stakeholders decides that it does not accept a mining project on their
land, it cannot be imposed against the will of the people.*!? With respect to Claimant, it was also still
required to reach agreements with 5 communities who owned the land and the 94 families who were
in possession of it — if any of these 99 agreements were to fail (and Claimant had obtained 0 by the
date of Supreme Decree 032), it would be fatal to the Project.>'* Other consequences are a matter of

able to accrue, given Claimant’s errors in obtaining the social license.*”7

265. Witness testimony confirms that the Santa Ana Project could not have continued in the social

atmosphere that erupted in the Puno Region in the first half of 2011. Regarding Dr. Flury’s statement
that it would have been reasonable to expect that Claimant’s ESIA would be approved, Dr. Flury also
admitted that his assumption did not account for the social unrest that — as Mr. de Mayolo admitted —
accompanied the Project prevented Claimant from even completing studies that MINEM had

requested in its observations to the ESIA.***4

266. To claim that Claimant’s community relations program was a success is wholly inconsistent with the

has not carried out sufficient outreach to acquire the required social license than tens of thousands of

of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any
person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State
party to the dispute; and

(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties
consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any
juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party
to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the
parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting
State for the purposes of this Convention.**?

Article 819: Claim by an Investor of a Party on Its Own Behalf

An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that the
other Party has breached:

Enterprises - State Enterprises), only to the extent that a designated
monopoly or state enterprise has acted in a manner inconsistent with the
Party’s obligations under Section A, other than an obligation under
paragraph 4 of Article 802, Articles 809, 810 or 816; or

(c) a legal stability agreement referred to in paragraph 2 of this Article, and

Convention;

(c) the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or

(d) any other body of rules approved by the Commission as available for
arbitrations under this Section.

The Commission shall have the power to make rules supplementing the applicable

arbitral rules and may amend any rules of its own making. Such rules shall be binding on
a Tribunal established under this Section, and on individual arbitrators serving on such a

Tribunal.

Additional Facility Rules for written consent of the parties;

(b) Article II of the New York Convention for an agreement in writing; and

A. WHETHER AN INVESTMENT CONFERRING JURISDICTION ON THE TRIBUNAL EXISTS
1. Respondent’s Arguments

275. Even if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over unlawful and bad-faith investments, Claimant’s
alleged investment is invalid under Peruvian law, which means that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
as there is no investment upon which to base a Treaty claim. Concessions obtained in violation of
Article 71 of the Constitution revert to the State. Claimant’s scheme is presently being examined in
a domestic court, and could result in Claimant being stripped of its concession rights entirely, as
required by Article 71. The Tribunal need not wait for a decision from the Peruvian judiciary — rather,

it may determine for itself that the Santa Ana acquisition violated Peruvian law.**

276. After the Hearing and in response to the Tribunal’s questions “(d) Of the two reasons relied upon by
Respondent for Decree 032, could that Decree also have been legally issued, if only one of the two
reasons could be established: (i) only the alleged illegality of the Claimant’s Application? or only
the unrest as it existed at that time?” and “(f) Was the Claimant denied due process in the procedure
leading to the promulgation of Supreme Decree 032, or otherwise?”*** Respondent explained that the
State has the discretionary right to reconsider and repeal earlier declarations of public necessity. A
repeal does not take property away from the concession owner, rather it simply prevents the

concession holder from using it during the ensuing court proceedings. *”

Here, Respondent
discovered that (1) Claimant had violated the Constitution in obtaining the public necessity
declaration and (2) that the premise that the Santa Ana Project would improve the public welfare of

local communities was gravely mistaken. The elimination of either of these bases of support could

have justified the decision to repeal the public necessity declaration.*** Respondent only took the

action that was immediately necessary to address both circumstances.*”

2. Claimant’s Arguments

277. No support whatsoever exists for Respondent’s position. The FTA and the ICSID Convention are
the relevant legal instruments that govern this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, including the definition of
“investment.” Respondent’s domestic law has no impact on the definition of “investment” for the
purposes of obtaining protections under the FTA. Thus, Respondent’s argument that this Tribunal
should make a jurisdictional finding based on the legality of the Santa Ana investment as a matter of

Peruvian law should be dismissed summarily.*°

278. As Respondent is well aware, other tribunals have consistently rejected Respondent’s argument that

  

national law governs the definition of “investment.” The tribunal in Convial Callao et al. v. Peru

expressly rejected Peru’s contention and applied the definition of “investment” contained in the
relevant BIT and ICSID Convention, without reference to Peruvian law, to assess whether an
investment existed within the meaning of that treaty“! The Saba Fakes tribunal expressly rejected
the argument that an “i//egal’” investment or one not made in “good faith” did not fall within Article
25(1) of the ICSID Convention’s definition of “investment.”’*? Here, the FTA and the ICSID

Convention are the relevant instruments to determine whether an investment exists. They are /ex

specialis and prevail over any other source of law applicable to the dispute. This Tribunal should not
look to Peruvian law, especially since the FTA does not require application of Peruvian law to the
definition of “investment” and does not contain an express legality requirement. Importing such a

requirement into the FTA and the ICSID Convention would do violence to both agreements.**7

279. In any event, Respondent has failed to satisfy its burden of proving that there has been a violation of

Peruvian law.*#* There can be no question that Claimant exercised its option lawfully under the

345

Option Agreements only after it obtained Supreme Decree 083. Respondent’s ex post facto

branding of the acquisition of the Santa Ana concessions as “il/egal’” is nothing more than an attempt

to avoid the consequences of its wrongful conduct.

280. To the extent that Respondent argues that Claimant’s rights would revert to the State if a domestic

court in Peru finds that Claimant’s acquisition of the Santa Ana concessions was unlawful, the
Tribunal should note that this argument concedes Claimant’s ownership of the Santa Ana
concessions, which are a protected investment under the FTA and the ICSID Convention.” The
determination of illegality by a national court is not binding on an investment tribunal, which is under

a duty to fulfill its independent mandate and to make its own assessment of facts and law.*“*

281. After the Hearing and in response to the Tribunal’s question (d) “Of the two reasons relied upon by

Respondent for Decree 032, could that Decree also have been legally issued, if only one of the two
reasons could be established: (i) only the alleged illegality of the Claimant’s Application? or only
the unrest as it existed at that time?”, Claimant explained that, even if there was a violation of Article
71, this should not have resulted in a revocation of Supreme Decree 083. Even Respondent’s expert
agreed that a violation of Article 71 does not justify expropriation, and certainly without due process

or compensation.“ Further, and also in response to the Tribunal’s question (b) “Did the Claimant

jurisdiction.*°°

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

282. Article 847 of the FTA provides an express and wide definition of the term “investment”, and it is

mandatory to apply it in the present case. The Article provides as follows:

investment means:

(a) an enterprise;
[ou]
(g) real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, acquired in the expectation or
used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes; and
(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory
of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under:
i) contracts involving the presence of an investor's property in the territory
of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions,

283. As is undisputed, at the time of the alleged breach of the FTA by Supreme Decree 032 published 25
June 2011, Claimant held, by Supreme Decree 083, a declaration of public necessity expressly
authorizing Claimant to acquire and possess concessions and rights over mines and supplementary
resources, to acquire mining rights, and to engage in mining activities. It is also undisputed that, after
the adoption of Supreme Decree 083 in 2007, Claimant acquired seven mining concessions and
proceeded with a great number of activities in the local communities (though these were not sufficient
in the view of Respondent). As reflected in both Parties’ submissions on the calculation of damages,

Respondent concedes that Claimant spent approximately USD $18 million after November 2007.*°!

284. These governmental authorizations and the resulting costs incurred by Claimant must be considered
as “interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to
economic activity in such territory, such as under: (i) contracts involving the presence of an
investor's property in the territory of the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or

concessions, or [...].”

285. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant made “investments” within the meaning of the

FTA, and that it is to be treated as an “investor.”

B. WHETHER CLAIMANT HELD THE RIGHTS ON WHICH IT BASES ITS CLAIM
1. Respondent’s Arguments

286. This Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Claimant does not own the investments upon which it bases
its claim. Even if this Tribunal determines that Claimant lawfully obtained some rights at Santa Ana,
Claimant never acquired the right to operate a “mining project” or a “right to mine”, upon which it
bases its claim. At most, Claimant held an exclusive right to seek a right to mine and to pursue a
mining project. Since Claimant cannot establish that it owned or controlled the right to mine at Santa

Ana, the Tribunal cannot assert jurisdiction.*

287. Claimant bears the burden of proving ownership of the investments on which its claim is based.**3

Claimant, however, refers to its investment as a “mining” project. Claimant has never undertaken
any “mining” in Santa Ana, nor has it ever had the right to do so. Claimant has never constructed or
operated a mine in Peru or elsewhere — it is in the mineral exploration business and has put forward

no evidence that it has the capabilities to build and operate a mine.***

288. Claimant never progressed beyond the earliest stages of the long and complex regulatory approval
process for obtaining a mining permit.*° Claimant’s obligation to apply for and obtain a host of
permits and approvals before exploiting and extracting silver at Santa Ana is not seriously in
dispute.**° Claimant’s entire case presupposes an investment that includes the right to mine at both
Santa Ana and Corani, and Claimant had no such right.*” Claimant’s assertion that its ownership of
the concessions grants it the right to “explore and exploit mineral resources” and “use and enjoy ...
products that are extracted” is not correct. Claimant’s failure to establish that it held the rights upon

which it bases its claim persists and is fatal to jurisdiction.***

2. Claimant’s Arguments

289. There are four reasons that this Tribunal should reject Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal lacks

jurisdiction because Claimant purportedly never obtained the right to operate a mining project in

 

Santa Ana. First, in investment law, it is uncontroversial that an investment typically consists of
several interrelated economic activities that should not be viewed in isolation. In making its
argument, Respondent seeks to limit and minimize the scope and nature of Claimant’s protected
investment in Respondent State. This argument misconstrues and ignores (1) the finding of public

necessity that expressly authorizes Claimant to acquire mining rights in the border region, (2)

Claimant’s acquisition of mining concessions comprising the Santa Ana Project and the Corani
Project, (3) the years Claimant engaged in expensive exploration and development efforts in
Respondent State, and that these efforts (4) resulted in the discovery of significant economic silver
mineralization in the area. Respondent’s attempt to focus on one single aspect of Claimant’s

investment, to the exclusion of the entirety of its investment should be rejected.*”

290. Second, at all relevant times, Claimant held the rights on which it bases its claim. As Prof. Bullard

 

explains, Claimant acquired the property rights over the mining concessions after it obtained the
declaration of public necessity in compliance with Peruvian law, through valid option contracts. As
confirmed by Peruvian mining law expert and former Minister of Energy and Mines, Hans Flury, the
concessions entailed many rights, including the right to own exploit mineral concessions, which form
the basis of its claim here.* Respondent conflates the existence of these rights with the need to
obtain permits and licenses to build and operate a mine. However, Respondent has admitted in these
proceedings that Claimant owned the mining concessions and mining rights in Respondent State,
having explained that “one possible outcome of the MINEM lawsuit was reversion of the mineral
rights to Peru.”**' That rights were granted was also confirmed by the Lima First Constitutional

Court.*?

291. Respondent’s argument ignores the statutory language, Respondent’s own legal experts, and the facts
of the case — each demonstrate that Claimant held an ascertainable set of rights that form the basis of
this claim.* The Peruvian General Mining Act provides that concessions grant “/the] holder the

Development of Natural Resources states that “the concession grants its holder the right to use and
enjoyment of the natural resources granted” and, consequently, the property of the fruits and products
to be extracted.** The Parties’ experts are also in agreement that the holder of a concession has the
exclusive right to explore for and produce the mineral resources in question.**° Claimant does not
dispute that there is a permitting process. But, the issue here is whether, by virtue of owning the
concessions, Claimant owned the rights of exploration and exploitation within the concession areas.
The answer to that question is yes. Respondent’s other expert, Mr. Jorge Danos Orddiiez, opines that
Supreme Decree 083 granted Claimant the right to acquire property, which Claimant has explained
at length that it lawfully did through exercise of the Option Agreements after issuance of Supreme

Decree 083.*7

292. Third, even if Claimant only had a mining exploration project, that would still be a protected

investment because it falls within the FTA’s definition of investment.**

293. Fourth, under international law, a state cannot benefit from its own wrongdoing.* Here, Respondent

cannot argue that Claimant had no right to mine, when it was Respondent’s own actions that thwarted
the development of the Project and prevented Claimant from obtaining the requisite permits and

authorizations.*”°

294. Respondent has cited the Gallo award for the general proposition that ownership or control of an

including written documentation and witness testimony.*7!

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

295. Respondent argues that “/e/ven if the Tribunal somehow determines that Claimant lawfilly obtained

some set of rights at Santa Ana, Claimant never acquired the right to operate a “mining project” or
a “right to mine,” upon which it bases its claims[.].*” But, Respondent concedes expressly that

“[a]t most, [Claimant] held an exclusive right to seek a right to mine and to pursue a mining

 

project.”*” In the view of the Tribunal, the latter is sufficient to confirm the jurisdiction to the

Tribunal.

296. Indeed, it is uncontroversial that an investment typically consists of several interrelated economic

activities which, step by step, finally lead to the implementation of a project such as mining activity.
As Claimant points out, the steps already obtained and completed were (1) the finding of public
necessity that expressly authorized Claimant to acquire mining rights in the border region, (2)
Claimant’s acquisition of mining concessions comprising the Santa Ana Project and the Corani
Project, (3) the years Claimant engaged in expensive exploration and development efforts in
Respondent State, and that these efforts (4) apparently resulted in the discovery of significant

economic silver mineralization in the area.

297. There can be no doubt that these acts give rise to “interests arising from the commitment of capital

371

372

373

304

or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under: (i)

[...] concessions, ...”, within the meaning of Article 847 of the FTA. Though the relevant
definition of investment must be drawn from the FTA, it should be noted that in the domestic law of
Peru, the Peruvian Constitution (Article 66) and the General Mining Law (Article 10) both define

concession rights as a “right in rem.”*"*

298. The Tribunal therefore concludes that Claimant held rights providing jurisdiction to the present

Tribunal for the claims raised.

C. THE LEGAL STANDARD: WHETHER LEGALITY OR GOOD FAITH IS A PREREQUISITE TO
THE TRIBUNAL’S EXERCISE OF JURISDICTION

1. Respondent’s Arguments

299. Investment arbitration tribunals lack jurisdiction over claims that are based on investments made in
violation of (1) domestic law or (2) the international law principle of good faith. Claimant’s purported
investment violates both. The /nceysa tribunal, cited by Plama, recognized that extending treaty
protections to investments made in bad faith or in violation of domestic law would reward investors’
misconduct, in violation of the principle of nemo auditor propriam turpitudinem allegans — no one
can benefit from his or her own wrongdoing. It would be inappropriate for the Tribunal to grant
jurisdiction because doing so would violate the international law principle that a claimant cannot

benefit from its own wrongdoing.*”*

300. International consensus dictates that Claimant must establish the legality of its investment, or else it
is not entitled to invoke the FTA’s substantive protections.*”° Phoenix Action’s discussion of the

legality requirement has been cited with approval by at least seven other investment arbitration

tribunals.*””

“The core lesson is that the purpose of the international protection through ICSID
arbitration cannot be granted to investments that are made contrary to law. The fact that
an investment is in violation of the laws of the host State can be manifest and will therefore
allow the tribunal to deny its jurisdiction.”°"

301. The Hamester tribunal, in what Claimant dismisses as “musings” stated as follows:

“An investment will not be protected if it has been created in violation of national or
international principles of good faith; by way of corruption, fraud, or deceitful conduct; or
if its creation itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international investment protection
under the ICSID Convention. It will also not be protected if it is made in violation of the
host State’s law (as elaborated, e.g. by the tribunal in Phoenix [Action].”*”"

302. The legality requirement does not arise out of a specific treaty provision, but rather out of the corpus
of international law and persuasive international arbitration jurisprudence. It is, what the Hamester
tribunal called a “general principle [] that exist[s] independently of the specific language to this effect
in the Treaty.” Other tribunals have agreed, drawing from the goals of international investment
protection as a whole.**’ These tribunals acknowledge a proposition that should be self-evident: a

investment cannot be rewarded with access to international dispute resolution mechanisms in defense

of its unlawful investment.**!

303. The Mamidoil tribunal drew a distinction between an investor that makes an investment only through

illegal activity (as did Claimant here) and an investor who commits illegal acts related to the
investment, after the investment has been made. In the latter situation, jurisdiction is not impacted.
The Mamidoil tribunal cautioned that “a State cannot be expected to have consented to an arbitral
dispute settlement mechanism for investments made in violation of its legislation.”**? Similarly, the
Liman Caspian Oil v. Kazakhstan tribunal concluded that it would not have jurisdiction over an

investment made in violation of international public policy.***

304. The Plama Decision on Jurisdiction does not support Claimant’s position on the effect of an illegally

acquired investment on jurisdiction.*** The conclusion to apply from that decision — as well as from
Yukos or Khan Resources v. Mongolia — is that, regardless of whether the Tribunal decides the case
on grounds of jurisdiction or on grounds of inadmissibility, Claimant is not entitled to any of the
substantive protections afforded by the FTA.**> An analogous application of the Malicorp decision
to Claimant’s claims would lead to the Tribunal to conclude that Respondent’s revocation of the

public necessity declaration was justified by the discovery of Claimant’s misconduct.**°

305. It strains credibility to suggest that Canada and Peru intended their FTA to protect unlawful

386

investments. In this respect, Claimant has cited Article 816 of the FTA — a provision that has nothing

to do with the international law principle requiring lawful investments. At most, Article 816 does

nothing more than declare that, if one of the treaty parties were to create “special formalities”
specifying how investments must be established in the host State, these rules would not give rise to a
violation of the national treatment standard, unless they “materially impair” the protections otherwise
afforded to investors in the FTA. Conceptually, Article 816 of the FTA is a carve-out to the FTA’s
national treatment provision. Contrary to Claimant’s position, the language does not “explicitly

exclude” the legality requirement from the FTA.**”

306. In response to questions from Arbitrators Sands and Pryles about whether Claimant’s alleged failure
reaches the threshold of seriousness so as to justify this Tribunal not to exercise jurisdiction,
Respondent explained that first, the failure is the violation of Article 71 of the Constitution, where
Claimant acquired the Concessions through a proxy or strawman. Second, in making this
representation, Claimant also began lying to the local populations about who owned the land and who
would provide the benefits — Claimant or Ms. Villavicencio. Claimant understood the seriousness of
its statements to the communities and to the Government. As a matter of law, this was a constitutional
violation, one which cannot be cured by a subsequent Public Necessity Decree. The breached
constitutional provision is one that involves internal and external security and even prompted

response from Bolivia.***

Respondent does not see the Option Agreements as the core of the
constitutional violation. Rather, from 2004 — 2007 and even assuming that the ownership was indirect
rather than direct (due to Ms. Villavicencio’s position as Claimant’s employee), the entire scheme
was in violation of the Constitution and this scheme went to the heart of the investment. Claimant
spent millions of dollars that they would not have, had they been acting lawfully. This unlawful
scheme robbed Respondent of the opportunity to exercise its sovereignty in terms of national security
from 2004 — 2007. Although there is no evidence of a factual impact on national security here, that
is likely because there was no assessment of the same, due to there being no application for a Public
Necessity Decree from 2000 — 2006. In 2000, the Ministry of Defense found that the presence of
foreign investors in that area would be a threat to Respondent’s national security. The grant of a
Public Necessity Decree in 2007 does not cure the past violations, as one cannot know what the

Government would have said in 2004, 2005, or 2006. When the Decree was granted, the Government

2. Claimant’s Arguments

308. The FTA does not contain a legality or good faith requirement. Article 816 of the FTA suggests that

the Contracting Parties agreed that the legality requirement would be excluded from the scope of the
FTA. Article 816 identifies the legality requirement as a special formality that the host State is

entitled to adopt if it so wishes. Thus, it is neither an express nor implied requirement under the

309. Under international law, the Tribunal may not import a requirement that limits its jurisdiction when
none is specified by the parties themselves. In Flughafen Zurich, Hamester, and Phoenix Action, the
applicable BITs expressly and unambiguously required compliance with the host State’s law. Those
tribunals’ musings on general requirements of international law are, therefore, dicta. Hamester and
Phoenix Action also have been heavily criticized for their lacking reasoning on the question of
illegality as a jurisdictional hurdle. Likewise, although the tribunal in SAUR opined on the existence
of an implicit requirement of legality and good faith, it undertook no analysis to substantiate this
opinion and, in any event, declined to find illegality. In Jnceysa, the Tribunal expressly noted that it
could only declare its incompetence to hear Inceysa’s complaint because the treaty parties had
intended to limit their consent to arbitration only to investments made in accordance with the laws in
force in each state party. The P/ama tribunal did not find that the investor’s deliberate deception and
active misrepresentations deprived the tribunal of jurisdiction. Rather, although the allegations of
illegality raised questions on the merits, they did not affect respondent State’s consent to arbitration
under the treaty. Similarly, the tribunal in Malicorp found that allegations of investor wrongdoing
do not necessarily deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction and are better suited to an analysis on the merits.
The doctrines of separability and competence-competence mandate that pleas of illegality be regarded
as questions on the merits of an investor’s claim, rather than jurisdictional hurdles. In determining
whether to consider the allegations as a matter of jurisdiction or merits, the Minnotte tribunal urged
consideration of whether the alleged fraud is “so manifest, and so closely connected to the facts (such
as the making of an investment) which form the basis of a tribunal’s jurisdiction as to warrant a
dismissal of claims in limine for want of jurisdiction.” Facts matter, and it would be wrong to simply
draw a legalistic conclusion without careful attention to the circumstances surrounding the alleged
illegality. Accordingly, this Tribunal should consider Respondent's allegations of fraud, deceit, and

bad faith in the context of the merits of the claim.*°

310. None of the cases cited by Respondent has held that a tribunal lacked jurisdiction solely on the basis
of a supposed implicit requirement that the investor’s investment be made in good faith and in
compliance with the host State’s law. Mamidoil, for example, involved a treaty containing an express
legality requirement, unlike the FTA in this case. The Mamidoil tribunal nonetheless found that it
had jurisdiction over that claimant’s claim, even though it found that investment to be tainted by
procedural illegality. Likewise, the Yukos tribunal declined to decide whether alleged illegality

operates as a bar to jurisdiction or as a bar to substantive protections. The Khan Resources tribunal

deferred the question of whether that claimant had breached host State law to the merits.*””

311. Case law also supports Claimants position that a finding of fraud is required before treating illegality
as peremptory. No tribunal has ever denied jurisdiction or declared inadmissible the entirety of a

claimant’s case where claimant did not act fraudulently or corruptly. Thus, it is practical to examine

the totality of Claimant’s claims together with Respondent's illegality defense.***

312. There are at least three situations where a tribunal may assess the substance of a claimant’s case, in

spite of a breach of national law in the making of the investment: (1) where an investor’s unlawful
actions attend the making of an investment, and the host State’s law provides that the illegality renders
the investment voidable rather than void ab initio;*° (2) where the allegedly unlawful conduct is

minor, procedural, or a good faith mistake;*”

and (3) where a State’s actions and representations to
the investor create a legitimate expectation on the part of the investor that his investment will be

protected.“°!

313. Regarding the first situation, absent fraud on the part of the investor, even an investment being

considered void under national law would not deprive the tribunal of jurisdiction. Liman Caspian
Oil v. Kazakhstan, where the tribunal distinguished between a transaction that was void or invalid,
and a transaction which is merely voidable, casts serious doubt on the propriety of treating violations

of national law as a jurisdictional issue per se.“

In the present case, Article 71 of the Peruvian
Constitution contemplates that rights obtained in contravention thereof revert to the State — they are
not void ab initio, and the State must take affirmative action to re-acquire rights a putative investor

unlawfully obtained. Claimant must, therefore, be held to have made a protected investment, and the

ICSID ARB/14/21 99

Tribunal may proceed to consider the merits of Claimant’s claims. Following Liman Caspian Oil,
even if a violation of Article 71 rendered a transaction void, an investment would nonetheless have
been made and a case based on a violation of the FTA would fall within the jurisdiction of the

Tribunal.‘

314. Regarding the second situation, Liman Caspian Oil is also instructive as to what form of investor

 

wrongdoing should be considered potentially jurisdictional in nature. There, the tribunal agreed that
it does not have jurisdiction over investments made in violation of international public policy,
including fraud and bribery, which must be proven by respondent. Thus, even if the Tribunal found
that a violation of Article 71 had occurred, that alone would be insufficient: Respondent would need
to demonstrate that Claimant knowingly and fraudulently misrepresented its relationship with Ms.
Villavicencio. Respondent cannot meet this burden, given Claimant’s transparent disclosure of the

Option Agreements and its following of Estudio Grau’s legal advice.**

315. Respondent’s argument that good faith is an independent pre-requisite to jurisdiction under ICSID

and international law is misguided. In each case on which Respondent relies, the tribunal found an
independent basis of bad faith to support a finding that it lacked jurisdiction due to investor
wrongdoing. If the Tribunal finds that Claimant acted in accordance with Peruvian law, Respondent’s

allegations of bad faith cannot defeat the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.“

316. Finally, with regard to the third situation, as in the case Kardassopoulos v. Georgia, here,

403

404

405

406

Respondent’s actions and representations vis-d-vis Claimant created in Claimant the legitimate
expectation that it had made a lawful investment that would be protected under the FTA in case of

breach. This expectation stems from Respondent’s own conduct and is entitled to treaty protection.*°°

317. The summary of Claimant’s arguments is best taken from its own words:

[...] Respondent has built its entire jurisdictional objection on an erroneous assumption:
that its allegations of illegality and fraud in the making of Bear Creek’s investment must
necessarily deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction or render Claimant's claims inadmissible.
The law is not binary, however, and it accords this Tribunal ample discretion to decide
whether the nature of the alleged illegality merits outright dismissal or a weighing of any
investor wrongdoing against the respondent State’s own violations of international law.”

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

318. As the Parties’ submissions show, the case law does not offer a clear basis regarding the standard to

be applied to determine jurisdiction. This Tribunal considers that such determination should be made

on the basis of conclusions that can be drawn from the applicable treaty.

319. In this context, the following wording of Article 816 of the FTA is of particular relevance: “Nothing

in Article 803 shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining a measure that

 

prescribes special formalities in ion with the blish of covered ii such as a

 

requirement that investments be legally constituted under the laws or regulations of the Party, [...].
Thus, Article 816 identifies the legality requirement as a “special formality” that the host State is
entitled to adopt if it so wishes. Since nowhere in the FTA or otherwise in the record is there an
express or implied provision of law to the effect that Peru made use of this option, it can only be
concluded that there is no jurisdictional requirement that Claimant’s investment was legally

constituted under the laws of Peru.

320. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that under international law, the Tribunal may not import a

requirement that limits its jurisdiction when such a limit is not specified by the parties. Indeed, the
above considerations distinguish the FTA from the treaties applicable in Flughafen Zurich, Hamester,
Inceysa, and Phoenix Action, which expressly required compliance with the host State’s law. In fact,
the wording of the FTA provides further clarity, because not only does it not mention such a limit,
but, by the wording cited above, provides that such a limit is considered a formality which would

have to be expressly included to be effective. Here, no such formality was expressly included.

VII.

325.

326.

In view of the above cited text, the words “such as” indicate that this would apply also to other limits
to jurisdiction. Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider that the alleged good faith of the investor

is a further condition under the FTA for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

As can be seen from case law, further considerations may be necessary in case of fraud by the investor.
However, the Tribunal does not have to enter into the question of whether the relevant case law may
support a finding that an investor’s fraud may exclude jurisdiction, since fraud by Claimant has not

been alleged by Respondent, and the Tribunal indeed does not see evidence for fraud from the file.

The above conclusions make it unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine the Parties’ arguments or
decide on (1) whether Claimant obtained the Concessions and made the investment in good faith and
in accordance with Peruvian law and (2) whether Respondent is estopped from asserting illegality or

bad faith“ in the context of jurisdiction.

The above conclusion does not exclude the possible relevance of illegality or lack of good faith with

respect to the merits.

ADMISSIBILITY OF CLAIMANT’S CLAIMS
A. RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

Respondent’s arguments were also repeated in relation to its submissions on the Tribunal’s questions
(a)(v) “As a matter of law, what are the consequences that follow from an absence of support on the
part of one or more relevant communities, or parts thereof, in relation to this investment?” and (b)
“Did the Claimant make all required disclosures in making its application for a Public Necessity
Decree? If not, what are the consequences for this case, including for the jurisdiction of the

Tribunal?”

In the alternative, if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction, it should dismiss this case as
inadmissible, as all claims rest on an unlawfully obtained investment. As explained in Respondent's

arguments related to jurisdiction, Claimant’s very acquisition of the Santa Ana mineral concessions

violated Article 71 of the Constitution — a longstanding legal provision that is specifically directed at
controlling natural resource investments by foreigners in the border zone.*!° To repeat from above,
the conclusion that this Tribunal should take from the Plama, Yukos, and the Khan Resources v.
Mongolia decisions is that, regardless of whether the Tribunal decides the case on grounds of
jurisdiction or on grounds of inadmissibility, Claimant is not entitled to any of the substantive

protections afforded by the FTA.*!!

327. The “unclean hands” doctrine has likewise been used to find a claimant's claims to be inadmissible.*!”

This Tribunal should not reward Claimant’s circumvention of Respondent’s Constitution with treaty
protection — and, indeed, Claimant cannot point to a single case where a tribunal has found that an
investor acquired its investment illegally or through bad faith and nevertheless found for that investor

on the merits.*!?

328. Respondent urges the Tribunal to find Claimant’s claims inadmissible if it were to find that Claimant

lacked a social license to build and operate the Santa Ana Project because it failed to comply with

international standards when designing and executing its community outreach program. *!*

B. CLAIMANT’S ARGUMENTS

329. The Tribunal should take the legality of the investment and good faith into account when adjudicating

the merits of the case, without limiting itself to the analysis of the question of the admissibility of

Claimant’s claims.*!5 Claimant's jurisdictional arguments are incorporated by reference.

330. Respondent assumes that in the face of illegality, the Tribunal must either dismiss on jurisdiction or

on the grounds of inadmissibility.41° Respondent has not, however, cited any case where a violation
of national law without fraudulent intent results in the dismissal for lack of jurisdiction or for the

inadmissibility of claims.“!”

331. There are situations where a tribunal may find illegality, yet nonetheless consider the substance of

claimant’s case and reach a decision on the merits of the claim. A claim of illegality cannot become
a “trump” in all instances, which would render an unlawful expropriation without redress.*!* Rather,
a finding of fraud before illegality is treated as peremptory and is supported by case law.*!” In Plama,
the investor was guilty of fraud and it was on that basis that the investor’s claims were inadmissible.
The Plama tribunal did not state that a violation of national law, without fraud, bears the consequence

of inadmissibility.*”°

332. In Plama and JInceysa, the tribunals found that, but for the unlawful conduct, the host State would not

45

416

418

419

have permitted the investment. Where the allegedly unlawful conduct is minor, procedural, or a good
faith error, the investor may still benefit from treaty protections and the tribunal may consider the
substantive merits of the case. Only grave violations of national law which were decisive to the host
State’s decision to allow the investment may justify a finding of inadmissibility. The issue, as

explained by the Minnotte tribunal, is whether Respondent has proven that there was a fraud and/or

deception that was of such a kind as to disentitle claimant of treaty protection. The Khan Resources
tribunal further noted that “it would undermine the purpose and object of the Treaty to deny the
investor the right to make its case before an arbitral tribunal based on the same alleged violations
the existence of which the investor seeks to dispute on the merits.’ Here, Respondent enacted
Supreme Decree 032 to impose sanctions available under local law upon Claimant. It forms the core
of Claimant’s case on jurisdiction and the merits. It would undermine the object and purpose of the
FTA to deny Claimant the right to make its case before this Tribunal based on the same alleged

violations the existence of which Claimant seeks to dispute on the merits.*7!

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONING

As is frequently the case in investment disputes, the Parties’ arguments regarding admissibility
overlap to a certain degree with those regarding jurisdiction. This is also the case with Respondent’s

objection to admissibility.

Respondent bases its objection to admissibility on two main arguments: (1) that all claims rest on an

unlawfully obtained investment and (2) that Claimant did not have a social license.

In this context, the Tribunal recalls its considerations and conclusions regarding jurisdiction. For the
same reasons as discussed above for jurisdiction, an alleged illegality of the investment is not
sufficient to deny admissibility, though it will have to be considered and may become relevant in the
examination of the merits. Likewise, the relevance of a social license for Claimant will have to be

considered in the merits and in the quantification of possible damages.

INVESTMENT IN THE SANTA ANA

The Parties have submitted that expropriation is addressed by Article 812 and Annex 812.1 of the

Article 812°: Expropriation

Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly,
or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”), except for a public
purpose’, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner
and on prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated
investment immediately before the expropriation took place (‘date of
expropriation”), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the
intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include

going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property,

and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.

Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely
transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and
shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the
date of expropriation until date of payment.

Footnote 3. For greater certainty, paragraph I of Article 812 shall be interpreted in
accordance with Annex 812.1

Footnote 4. The term “public purpose” shall be interpreted in accordance with
international law. It is not meant to create any inconsistency with the same or similar
concepts in the domestic law of either Party.

Annex 812.1 Indirect Expropriation

The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:

(a)

)

o

ICSID ARB/14/21

Indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that
have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or
outright seizure;

The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party
constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry
that considers, among other factors:

i) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the
sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse
effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an
indirect expropriation has occurred,

(ii) the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with
distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and

(iii) the character of the measure or series of measures;

Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures is so
severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been
adopted and applied in good faith, non-discriminatory measures of a Party that are

106

designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as
health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.

337. Respondent has submitted that Chapter 22 of the FTA is also relevant:

Article 2201: General Exceptions
[ou]

For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that
such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable
discrimination between ii or between i ‘s, ora di: /restriction
on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:

(a) to protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties
understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect
human, animal or plant life or health;

(b) to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent
with this Agreement; or

(c) for the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.
1. Arguments from the Government of Canada and Party Responses
338. The views of the Government of Canada are best taken from its own words:

3. [...] An analysis of breach of Article 812 requires as a first step the identification
of the investment alleged to have been expropriated. For there to be an
expropriation, there must be a taking of fundamental ownership rights, either
directly or indirectly, that causes a substantial deprivation of economic value of
the investment.

4. In the case of an alleged indirect expropriation, Annex 812.1 provides guidance on
how to distinguish between whether an indirect expropriation and bona fide
regulation that does not amount to an expropriation. Whether a measure
constitutes a nondiscriminatory, regulatory measure designed to protect public
welfare — as opposed to an indirect expropriation — requires a case-by-case, fact
based inquiry that considers various factors. The Parties have articulated certain
of these factors in Annex 812.1 to guide the Tribunal, including the economic
impact of the measure or series of measures, the extent to which the measure or
series of measures interferes with distinct, reasonable investment-backed
expectations, and the character of the measure or series of measures (for example
if the measure is general in nature as opposed to targeting a particular investment).
None of these factors will be determinative on its own. Together, they must be
weighed along with any other relevant factors.

3. A State is not required to compensate an investment for any loss sustained by the
imposition of a non-discriminatory, regulatory measure designed and applied to

ICSID ARB/14/21 107

protect legitimate public welfare objectives. As the tribunal in Suez InterAgua v.
Argentina stated, “in evaluating a claim of expropriation it is important to
recognize a State’s legitimate right to regulate and to exercise its police power in
the interests of public welfare and not to confuse measures of that nature with
expropriation.”

6. A non-discriminatory measure that is designed to protect legitimate public welfare
objectives does not constitute indirect expropriation except in rare circumstances
where its impacts are so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be
reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith.”

339. Claimant states that it adopted and applied the same test with the same factors in its pleadings and

has shown that Claimant’s claim against Respondent meets these factors. According to Claimant,
Respondent has advocated for a more restrictive reading of the FTA — a reading that the text of the

FTA does not support.*?3

340. Respondent explains that it agrees with Canada on the proper interpretation of Article 812 of the FTA.

422

423

424

There is agreement between the Parties and with Canada on the relevance of Annex 812.1. The issue
that was not resolved by Canada’s submission is the definition of “rare.” The Tribunal will need to
rely on the Parties’ submissions — and its own interpretation — to determine whether Claimant’s
arguments with respect to this definition are credible or even persuasive. Respondent maintains that

it is not.

2. Whether Supreme Decree 032 Effected an Indirect Expropriation
(a) Claimant’s Arguments

341. Supreme Decree 032 indirectly expropriated Claimant’s investment in Santa Ana, in violation of
Annex 812.1 of the FTA, which specifically defines “indirect expropriation.”*> Applying the tests
from Annex 812.1 of the FTA, this Tribunal will find that, under Annex 812.1(b), Supreme Decree
032 constitutes an “indirect expropriation” and that, under Annex 812.1(c), it was “so severe in light
of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good

faith?°

(i) Arguments Related to Annex 812.1(b)

342. Starting with the “case-by-case, fact based inquiry” mandated by Annex 812.1(b) — which
Respondent does not address — it is readily apparent that Supreme Decree 032 was expropriatory.
Supreme Decree 032 had a substantial, adverse impact on the value of Claimant’s investment. This,
in the words of the Tecmed tribunal, is relevant in distinguishing between a regulatory measure and a
de facto expropriation that deprives assets and rights of real substance. By reducing Claimant’s
investment to mining concessions to which Claimant no longer possessed clean title, Supreme Decree
032 rendered Claimant’s investment worthless and incapable of sale. It also caused a US$ 170.6
million reduction in the value for the Corani Project, which has always been linked to the Santa Ana

Project.*?”

343. The second factor listed in Annex 812.1(b) is the extent to which the measure interferes with the

 

investor’s distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations. Claimant purchased seven mining
concessions on the basis of Supreme Decree 083. Claimant invested tens of millions of dollars in

developing the Santa Ana Project and reasonably expected that Respondent would not interfere with

ICSID ARB/14/21 109

Claimant’s right to engage in mining activity for economic benefit arbitrarily, discriminatorily, and
without due process of law. Claimant reasonably expected that the authorization granted in Supreme
Decree 083 would last as long as Claimant did not pose an external threat to Respondent’s national

security. These expectations were shattered by Supreme Decree 032.47

344. The third factor listed in Annex 812.1(b) “takes account of the nature and character of the measure,
including [...] ‘whether the interference with property can be characterized as a physical invasion
by government or whether it is regulatory in nature, [...].” That Supreme Decree 032 individually
targets Claimant for political reasons is relevant under this third factor. Supreme Decree 032 did not
arise from a public program and is not an abstract measure of general regulatory character. Rather,
Supreme Decree 032 was issued when Respondent caved to electoral interests, outside of the legal

process for administrative acts and in violation of Claimant’s due process rights.‘

(ii) Arguments Related to Annex 812.1(c) and the Tribunal’s Questions (c) and (f)

345. Application of Annex 812.1(c) does not exonerate Respondent from liability for this indirect
expropriation. Although Claimant need only prove one of the three elements of Annex 812.1(c) to
prevail, Claimant has proven all three: Supreme Decree 032 (i) represents a “rare circumstance’, (ii)

is discriminatory, and (iii) was not designed to protect public safety.*”°

346. The language of Annex 812.1(c) is broad and requires a case-by-case factual inquiry. Regarding the
first element of “rare circumstances’, although Respondent acknowledges that the FTA does not
define “rare circumstances”, Respondent seeks to set out an “elevated standard” that is not supported
by the express text of the FTA or the Contracting Parties’ intent to afford protections against
expropriation, in order to stimulate investment. Annex 812.1(c) does not impose a high burden in
proving that the circumstances were rare. Rather, Annex 812.1(c) is intended to reflect that ordinary

regulatory measures will not lead to international liability, except in rare circumstances. “Rare” is

commonly defined as something “not occurring very often.” Here, Supreme Decree 032 is no general
regulatory measure: it is a targeted administrative decision. This type of decree is not a regular
occurrence under Peruvian law, and the expert, Mr. Flury, is unaware of the Ministry of Mines ever

issuing a similar decree.“*!

347. Contrary to Respondent’s argument, there is no part of the applicable legal standard that requires

presuming that Respondent acted in good faith. Instead, Annex 812.1(c) requires proportionality
between the impact of the measure and its purpose — and proportionality is wholly lacking in Supreme
Decree 032. The severity of Supreme Decree 032 is beyond question: it permanently deprives
Claimant of its ability to own and operate its lawfully-acquired mining concessions. The
disproportionality between this and the stated goal of quelling political pressure and social protests is
evident, and Respondent could have enacted a temporary measure instead. Indeed, when a non-
discriminatory measure that is designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives is
“so severe in light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and

applied in good faith”, that constitutes an indirect expropriation.**”

348. Supreme Decree 032 was discriminatory. It specifically and vindictively targeted only Claimant. No

431

other mining company lost its right to own and operate its mining concessions to quell the social
protests. Although other foreign investors have used similar structures to acquire mining concessions
within 50 km of the Peruvian border, Respondent never challenged the way in which these investors

acquired their concessions.* Again, Mr. Flury is not aware of MINEM ever issuing a similar

349. As Claimant’s Witness, then-Minister of Mines Gala confirms, Supreme Decree 032 was not designed

and applied to protect a legitimate public welfare objective. It was championed by Mr. Aduviri of
the FDRN as part of his political platform. Respondent implemented Supreme Decree 032 in an effort
to placate political pressure, which is not a legitimate public welfare objective. That Respondent
adopted Supreme Decree 032 with other interconnected measures intended to address the full range
of the protests is nothing more than a veiled attempt to legitimize the admittedly unconstitutional
decree.**° Even Respondent’s government officials have stated that cancellation of the Santa Ana

also recall that the Constitutional Court of Lima found that the protests were not attributable to actions

or omissions by Claimant.**”

350. Even if Supreme Decree 032 were non-discriminatory and were appropriately designed and applied,
the utter disregard for due process that enabled its issuance would still warrant this Tribunal’s finding
that Respondent indirectly expropriated Claimant’s investment. Respondent was under a duty to
protect both its citizens and foreign investors in its territory. Instead, it issued Supreme Decree 032,
in violation of its Constitution, without due process, for political reasons. It is “rare” that a State will
so blatantly and knowingly disregard its own legal framework, its international legal obligations, and
all semblance of due process — and that should compel the Tribunal to find that Supreme Decree 032

constitutes an indirect expropriation.***

351. To the extent that Respondent has argued that Supreme Decree 032 was issued as part of a
comprehensive set of good faith measures*® and that other concessions were also impacted, Claimant
notes that there is a material difference when concessions are not merely “impacted” but are
“taken.”“° Testimony confirmed that no other concession owners permanently lost their mining

rights as Claimant did.**!

352. In its Post-Hearing Brief, in response to the Tribunal’s question (f), “/w/as the Claimant denied due
process in the procedure leading to the promulgation of Supreme Decree 032, or otherwise?’*”,
Claimant explained that Respondent enacted Supreme Decree 032 in violation of Claimant’s due
process rights. Although the Government considered the protesters’ demands unconstitutional,

was at fault for the social protests. The decision in Cooper Mesa provides guidance on the type of

conduct that can indicate a causal link — there is no such evidence in the record in this arbitration.*”

(b) Respondent’s Arguments

355. Annex 812.1 of the FTA expressly defines indirect expropriation as a measure that has “an effect
equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title.” Supreme Decree 032 did not
cancel or transfer ownership. Rather, it revoked the public necessity declaration that gave Claimant
permission to acquire or possess the concessions. At most, Supreme Decree 032 effected an indirect

expropriation because Claimant maintains title to the Santa Ana concessions.***

(i) Arguments Related to Annex 812.1(b)

356. Adding the second test under Annex 812.1(b) (which mandates a case-by-case inquiry into a
measure’s economic impact, the extent of any interference with expectations, and the character of the

measure) does not lower Claimant’s burden.*”

357. Respondent’s position is that, under Annex 812.1 “Claimant’s indirect expropriation claim will fail
unless Claimant can prove that the enactment of Supreme Decree No. 032: (i) represents a ‘rare

circumstance; (ii) is discriminatory; or (iii) was not designed to protect public safety.“

(ii) | Arguments Related to Annex 812.1(c) and the Tribunal’s Questions (c) and (f)

358. Claimant is seeking to invent a lower standard of expropriation — one that ignores the transfer of title

requirement. It argues that the Quiborax tribunal held that State action would need only “have the

effect of transferring the title” to amount to a direct expropriation.**! In that case, and unlike the case
here, the State expressly revoked claimant’s mining concessions by decree.“ In Quiborax, there was
a transfer of title and the tribunal held that “for a direct expropriation to occur, there must be a

forcible taking or transfer of title to the State that deprives the investor of its investment.”*

359. Claimant is simply incorrect when it argues that Respondent expropriated the 2007 public necessity

decree, which Claimant portrays as an “essential component’ of its rights.* First, this is an argument

for “indirect”, rather than direct expropriation. Second and more importantly —- Supreme Decree 083

 

granted Claimant no specific mining rights. Instead, it granted Claimant permission to acquire mining
concessions. The concessions — not the public necessity declaration in the Supreme Decree — allow
Claimant to apply for permits and authorizations. Here, since Claimant still holds title to the
concessions, no specific valuable rights have been transferred and Claimant has no claim for direct

expropriation.*°

360. Claimant’s indirect expropriation claim will fail because Claimant is unable to prove that Supreme

Decree 032 meets any of the three required elements contained in Annex 812.1(c) of the FTA, namely
that it (i) represents a rare circumstance, (ii) is discriminatory, or (iii) was not designed to protect
legitimate public welfare objectives.*° Supreme Decree 032 is a non-discriminatory measure,

adopted absent “rare circumstances”, in order to further legitimate sovereign interests.“”

361. First, Supreme Decree 032 does not represent a “rare circumstance” of indirect expropriation by a

 

good faith government measure. This is a high threshold — and there is nothing “rare” about a

sovereign State acting to protect its citizens.“ A rare circumstance might include a showing of bad
faith on the part of the State.“ Although Claimant alleges bad faith, its allegations are baseless,
especially in light of the legal standard, which presumes that the regulatory authority acts in good
faith.“ Respondent was not aware of the scope or details of the illegal scheme through which
Claimant acquired the Santa Ana Concessions until June 2011, when protestors raised the issue with
the Government.*”! Claimant’s reading of the “rare circumstances” language is outlandish. Under
Claimant’s theory, any would-be claimant could pass the “rare circumstances” test simply by
presenting a handful of facts that are unique to its case. This cannot be what the Contracting Parties
intended when they agreed to the language in Annex 812.1(c) of the FTA and Claimant’s argument

must, therefore, be rejected.*””

362. Second, Supreme Decree 032 is not discriminatory. Rather, Respondent took a specific action related

to Santa Ana based on its unique circumstances, namely, its dubious acquisition and its status as a
lightning rod for protest.” Although Claimant points out that no other mining company lost its right
to own and operate mining concessions, Claimant does not identify a single comparable mining
company that was the target of protests or that used a scheme similar to Claimant’s to acquire
concession rights. Unless and until Claimant can identify another mining company in similar
circumstances, its discrimination argument merits no consideration.’ The protests in southern Puno
focused directly on the Santa Ana Project and, therefore, taking actions with respect to Santa Ana in

particular was a rational regulatory choice. In any event, Respondent's actions in the mining sector

363. Third, Supreme Decree 032 addresses a legitimate public welfare objective — promoting public safety

and safeguarding the integrity of Respondent’s constitutional and regulatory system for natural
resources. The suggestion that Supreme Decree 032 was politically motivated is unsupported,

illogical, and at odds with considerable witness testimony.*”

364. Claimant is inviting the Tribunal to view the creation of Supreme Decree 032 “through the clinical

lens of five years’ hindsight, rather than appreciating the extraordinary situation which the

government was faced with at the time.’*”

At the time, Congressman Yohnny Lescana, who
represents the Amayra population in South Puno, presented documentation showing Claimant’s
unlawful scheme to a room full of protestors. The facts were deemed to be truthful at the time (and
in hindsight, they also were). Claimant could have questioned former Prime Minister Rosario
Fernandez, who chaired the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Justice at the time, for more
information about the deliberative process leading to Supreme Decree 032, but Claimant chose not

or rescind an order declaring a foreign investment to be a public necessity.* The Council of
Ministers is not required to consult a private party potentially affected by such a Decree.*** Here, the
Government responded in an appropriate and expeditious manner to a crisis, taking only the action
that was necessary to address the apparent illegality and the Puno crisis.“** In light of the
circumstances that existed when the Supreme Decree was issued, it would have been inappropriate
and/or impossible for Respondent to have solicited Claimant’s views before issuing the Decree.***
Even if Respondent had, the result would not have changed, as Claimant cannot deny the relevant
facts that were the basis for the issuance of the Decree, namely that Claimant used its own employee
to acquire the concessions that that it explored and was in de facto possession of the concessions

through the employee.**°

Respondent has not pleaded “necessity” in the sense of Article 25 of the ILC Articles because the
issuance of a Public Necessity Decree is a discretionary act of Government, making it unnecessary to
rely on the ILC Articles. After issuing Supreme Decree 032, Respondent initiated court

494

496

decision to issue Supreme Decree 032, and on what evidence did the State authorities rely?”*,

Respondent explained that the decision to issue Supreme Decree 032 was based on (1) the discovery
of Claimant’s unconstitutional possession of the Santa Ana concessions and (2) the social crisis and

493

protests against the Santa Ana Projec Regarding the first point, the Government learned during a

meeting in Lima in June 2011 that Claimant had operated in the border region and possessed the
concessions through proxy — Ms. Villavicencio — before it received its public necessity declaration,
when an elected official presented documents proving the same.*** Although Respondent no longer
has the documents, their content is confirmed by witness testimony.*’* The information in the
documents was accurate.“ Regarding the second point, and given that the public was aware of the
Constitutional violation, the Government could no longer sustain Claimant’s public necessity
declaration. In substantial part, the source of the social crisis was community opposition to the Santa

Ana Project.*°’ Time was of the essence and it was clear that Claimant has lost all community

(c) The Tribunal’s Reasoning

368. At the beginning of its considerations, the Tribunal recalls that the FTA contains express provisions

regarding indirect expropriation.
369. First, Article 812.1 of the FTA expressly includes indirect expropriation by the wording:

Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly, or
indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation
(hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”’), except for a public purpose’, in accordance
with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on prompt, adequate and
effective compensation.

370. The footnotes included in Article 812.1 provide:

Footnote 3. For greater certainty, paragraph I of Article 812 shall be interpreted in
accordance with Annex 812.1

Footnote 4. The term “public purpose” shall be interpreted in accordance with
international law. It is not meant to create any inconsistency with the same or similar
concepts in the domestic law of either Party.

371. Further, Annex 812.1 referred to in footnote 3 provides:

Annex 812.1 Indirect Expropriation
The Parties confirm their shared understanding that:

(a) Indirect expropriation results from a measure or series of measures of a Party that
have an effect equivalent to direct expropriation without formal transfer of title or
outright seizure;

(b) The determination of whether a measure or series of measures of a Party
constitutes an indirect expropriation requires a case-by-case, fact-based inquiry
that considers, among other factors:

i) the economic impact of the measure or series of measures, although the
sole fact that a measure or series of measures of a Party has an adverse

effect on the economic value of an investment does not establish that an
indirect expropriation has occurred,

(ii) the extent to which the measure or series of measures interferes with
distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations, and

(iii) the character of the measure or series of measures;

(c) Except in rare circumstances, such as when a measure or series of measures is so
severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot be reasonably viewed as having been
adopted and applied in good faith, non-discriminatory measures of a Party that are
designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as
health, safety and the environment, do not constitute indirect expropriation.

 

With these provisions, the FTA contains more extensive and detailed definitions and rules than do
most other BITs. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that its examination of whether Supreme Decree
032 was an indirect expropriation by Respondent must focus on these specific provisions, which are

applicable in the present case.
Supreme Decree 032, in its Article 1, expressly derogates Supreme Decree 083 which, expressly:

. in its Article 1 declared that Claimant’s private investment in mining activities “is
a public necessity” as required under Article 71 of the Constitution of Peru,

. in its Article 2 authorized Claimant to acquire seven defined mining rights located
in the Puno department,

. in its Article 3 ruled that Respondent’s mining authority “shall grant the
authorizations” for Claimant’s mining activities listed in Article 2.

(i) Examination of the “factors” provided by Annex 812.1 FTA

The Tribunal will now examine whether these effects of Supreme Decree 032 fall under the “factors”
that Annex 812.1 of the FTA mentions in its subsection (b) for the determination of whether a measure

constitutes an indirect expropriation.

Applying the first of these factors mentioned in subsection (i), the Tribunal finds that there was an
obvious “economic impact” of Supreme Decree 032 by revoking the above-mentioned authorizations
of Supreme Decree 083, which deprived Claimant of all the major legal rights it had obtained and

needed for the realization of its mining Project.

Applying the second of these factors mentioned in subsection (ii), the Tribunal finds that “distinct,

reasonable expectations” which Claimant could base on the rulings in Supreme Decree 083 were

ICSID ARB/14/21 123

“interfered with{.|” As Claimant points out*” and as is obvious to the Tribunal, Claimant relied on
the express governmental authorization by Supreme Decree 083, when it exercised its options to
acquire the Karina Mining Concessions in December 2007. Without these authorizations, Claimant

could not have been expected to invest the amounts it undisputedly invested between 2007 and 2011.

377. Applying the third of these factors mentioned in subsection (iii), the Tribunal will hereafter examine
in detail the “character of the measure” by considering the wording and reasoning provided in

Supreme Decree 032 and the circumstances under which it was decided and issued.

(ii) Summary of the Factual Circumstances leading to Supreme Decree 032

378. Asa first step, the Tribunal will now summarize the factual circumstances leading to Supreme Decree

032 as it evaluates and concludes from the evidence available from the file and from the Hearing.

379. Up to the meeting of June 23, 2011, all authorities speaking for Respondent had said that they
considered the procedure adopted by Claimant and the authorizations granted to Claimant to be legal.
Claimant’s application for the declaration of public necessity included the Option Agreements and
disclosed Claimant’s relationship with Ms. Villavicencio. MINEM™, the Ministry of Defence*”',

and the Vice-Minister Secretary General of Foreign Affairs*”

all reviewed the application. After
approximately one year of review, Supreme Decree 083 was issued. It expressly included the
authorizations and rights mentioned above and was signed by the Constitutional President of Peru,
the President of the Council of Ministers and Minister of Justice, the Minister of Defence, and the

Minister of Energy and Mines.**?

Over a period of approximately three years thereafter, as will be
addressed in some more detail later in this Award, Respondent supported Claimant’s Project in

various ways. Respondent approved Claimant’s CPP and publicly acknowledged that revoking

Supreme Decree 083 would be “completely illegal{.|”* Further, Respondent’s witness, Vice-
Minister Gala, conceded in an interview that the social unrest in the Puno region was not a sufficient

reason to derogate Supreme Decree 083.°°

380. When from June 17 — 23, 2011, the Prime Minister and other government officials met with
representatives of the protesters in Lima, these meetings and particularly the meeting of June 23, 2011
were undisputedly organized to deal with the social unrest. The Tribunal appreciates that, at that
time, the Government was under strong political pressure and was urgently looking for steps that
could be hoped to improve the situation. The Tribunal also finds it politically plausible that the
Government did not invite Claimant to attend the meeting because such attendance might indeed have
made the discussion at the meeting more difficult. From the evidence, it is clear that Respondent’s
representatives as well as the other participants were desperately looking for a helpful decision, but
had great difficulties in agreeing on one. Under these circumstances, when around 9 or 10 pm
Congressman Lescano intervened and alleged that Claimant had illegally obtained Supreme Decree
083 by involving Ms. Villavicencio without disclosing that to Respondent, it seems that those at the
meeting “jumped” on that reason in order to derogate Supreme Decree 083. Respondent alleges that
Congressman Lescano presented new documents which for the first time showed this allegation. The
testimony of Respondent’s witnesses Vice-Minister Gala and Mr. Zegarra provide some details of
what occurred in this regard at the meeting on June 23, 2011.° Mr. Zegarra testified that, in his
position as the Director of the Office of the Legal Advisor of the Ministry of Mines, he participated
in the meeting as an observer and gave legal advice at the meeting. He also testified that the documents
were reviewed “very quickly’*”” and that he did not recall “exactly the sequence of events.”**

381. Neither the nature of these documents nor the persons who examined them thereafter could be fully
clarified at the Hearing. Respondent has not been able to produce such documents and has claimed

that these were lost in the subsequent process. This is difficult to understand in view of the alleged

high relevance of the documents as a basis for an important decision of the Government, i.e. Supreme
Decree 032. The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that Respondent has not fulfilled its burden of proof

in this regard and it cannot rely on such documents.

It is undisputed that, after the alleged documents had been shown in the meeting around 9 or 10 pm
on June 23, according to Respondent’s witness Mr. Zegarra, by | or 2 in the morning, the first and
final versions of Article 1 of Supreme Decree 032 (which derogated Supreme Decree 083) were
drafted by a person he could not identify. He assumes, though he could not provide any details, that
by 1:30 am, 15 to 19 ministers of the Council of Ministers could be reached, were contacted, approved
the draft without seeing the alleged documents, and that the President of the Republic signed the
Supreme Decree. Neither Mr. Gala nor Mr. Zegarra could provide any details of this process as it
occurred during these hours of the night.*°

It is undisputed that Claimant was not contacted and given an opportunity to comment before

Supreme Decree 032 was issued.

(iii) Legal Evaluation

Taking into account the above summary of the factual development until Supreme Decree 032 was

issued, the Tribunal will now turn to the legal evaluation.

The Tribunal’s Questions in section 2.1.4 (c) and (d) of PO-10 address the legal basis of Supreme

Decree 032 and the Parties replied to these questions in their Post-Hearing Briefs.

Supreme Decree 032 expressly contains the following references regarding the evidence it relies on:

In view of the documents submitted, Supreme Decree No. 083-2007-EM was issued;

Circumstances have been made known that would imply the disappearance of the legally
required conditions for the issuance of the mentioned act;

[J]

As such, given the existence of these new circumstances, it is necessary to issue the
corresponding act; [...]

ICSID ARB/14/21 126

387.

388.

389.

390.

391.

392.

It is not quite clear whether this reference refers to the documents allegedly presented at the meeting
of June 23, 2011. This seems probable in view of the references to “Circumstances have been made
known” and “these new circumstances.” As the Tribunal concluded above, the existence and content
of such documents has not been shown and the Tribunal, thus, cannot rely on them. Further, no other
new documents have been presented by Respondent to which the above cited reference may be
directed. Therefore, the Tribunal has to conclude that the above cited reference in Supreme Decree

032 to “documents” and “circumstances” provides no evidentiary justification for the Decree.
Further, Supreme Decree 032 provides expressly two legal reasons on which it relies:

1) the existence of the alleged “new circumstances” already addressed above.

2) “Additionally, it was deemed pertinent to provide that the Executive Power, for
the purpose of safeguarding the environmental and social conditions in the areas
of the Huacullani and Kelluyo districts in the Chucuito province of the Puno
department”
As will be elaborated below, neither justification was sufficient to justify the derogation of Supreme

Decree 083.

(iv) Did Claimant’s Involvement of Ms. Villavicencio Justify the Derogation of
Decree 083?

The first reason, the “new circumstances”, relies on the allegedly newly discovered

unconstitutionality of Supreme Decree 083 due to the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio.

As already mentioned above, the evidence provided by Respondent does not show that any new
documents were produced at the meeting of June 23, 2011 which showed new circumstances.
Accordingly, the Tribunal has to examine whether the existing file in this arbitration would justify

the allegation of unconstitutionality.

In this context, it is helpful to recall the timetable of relevant events submitted by Claimant*!” and

Respondent. Copies of the documents regarding the Option Agreements were attached in Annexes
VIII and IX of the Application. By letter dated February 8, 2008, MINEM confirmed having received
the Application and requested further information. But, neither in that letter, nor later, did MINEM

request any further information regarding or objecting to the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio.

394. After nearly one year of what Respondent itself characterizes as “careful consideration by the

government authorities” *'*

, on November 28, 2007 Respondent approved the Application by
Supreme Decree 083 signed by the Constitutional President of Peru, the President of the Council of
Ministers, the Minister of Energy and Mines, and the Minister of Defence. The Decree was published
the following day and expressly gave the declaration of Public Necessity required under Article 71
of the Constitution and authorized Claimant to acquire the seven mining concessions. Thereafter,
Ms. Villavicencio transferred to Claimant the concessions as was provided in the seven option

agreements.

These transfer agreements were registered by SUNARP on February | and 28,

395. From this evidence, it is clear that the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio was disclosed in the
Application when it was examined by the various government authorities. Respondent does not deny
having received this information, but claims that it was “given in separate bits and pieces to separate
entities or divisions within MINEM. No one official knew the full extent of Bear Creek’s relations and
agreements with Ms. Villavicencio”’*'> and that “only [...] a single piece of paper buried on page 83
of some 200 pages of the application showed that she was a legal representative of Bear Creek for
limited matters — but not that she was an employee.”*'® The Tribunal is not persuaded by these
objections. Ms. Villavicencio had been registered as an employee of Bear Creek with the Peruvian

Ministry of Labor since 2003. Also in 2003, SUNARP registered the Power of Attorney for Ms.

Villavicencio as legal representative of Claimant in certain matters. The Option Agreements
submitted with the Application demonstrated that Ms. Villavicencio, a Peruvian citizen, was to
transfer the concessions to Claimant, a foreign investor, once the Government had confirmed the
public necessity in accordance with Article 71 of the Constitution. Respondent has not been able to
point to any legal disclosure requirement disregarded by Ms. Villavicencio or by Claimant in its

517 over a

Application. Regardless, during the “careful consideration by the government authorities’
period of almost one year, the above mentioned available information regarding Ms. Villavicencio’s
involvement could not be neglected by the government agencies involved in the process and at the
very least should have been noted. The alleged oversight, if it existed, must be attributed to
Respondent and not to Claimant. Therefore, the Tribunal does not see any reason why the process as

conducted would make the Application or the resulting Supreme Decree 083 unconstitutional.

This conclusion is confirmed by the Decision of the First Specialized Constitutional Court of Lima

of May 12, 2014.°'* Its dispositive has the following wording:

DECLARE IN FORCE:

1. The acknowledgement of the private investment to be carried out by BEAR CREEK
in the development of the Santa Ana mining project as a public necessity; and

2. The ownership of BEAR CREEK of the following mining rights located in the Puno
department, in the border zone with Bolivia: i) KARINA 9A under code 01-01462-
04; ii) KARINA I under code 01-01463-04; iii) KARINA 2 under code 01-01464-
04; iv) KARINA 5 under code 01-03676-04; v) KARINA 6 under code 01-03678-
04; and vi) KARINA 7 under code 01-03677-04.

And in particular, its reasoning in section 11.3. expresses:

In this case, claimant was granted mining rights for Karina 9A, Karina 1, Karina 2, Karina
3, Karina 5, Karina 6 and Karina 7 afier complying with the legally required requirements
to obtain the same within the fifty kilometers from the border, and (the investment) declared
a public necessity which resulted in the investment of the Santa Ana project that bore the
authorization of the General Director of Mining Environmental Matters [...]

Respondent filed an appeal against the decision, but the appeal was not continued because Claimant
withdrew its action upon commencing this ICSID arbitration. However, the present Tribunal

considers this decision as relevant for its own examination. It serves at least as a confirmation by a

court with special expertise and jurisdiction for the Constitution of Peru for the Tribunal’s own
conclusion that Supreme Decree 083 was not unconstitutional due to the application process of

Claimant.

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the first reason given in Supreme Decree 032 and in
Respondent’s arguments, i.e. that Claimant had illegally obtained the public necessity declaration by

Supreme Decree 083 through to the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio, is not valid.

(v) Did the Social Unrest Justify the Derogation of Supreme Decree 083?

The Tribunal will now examine the second reason given in Supreme Decree 032 and in Respondent’s
arguments, i.e. that the social unrest in the Puno department required the derogation of Supreme

Decree 083.

It is undisputed that this social unrest existed and indeed that it was the reason for the meetings in
Lima which ended by the decisions in the evening of June 23 and in the early morning of June 24,
2011. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls its summary of the factual situation above regarding the
strong political pressure on Respondent at that time. The Tribunal appreciates that the Government
was desperately searching for a solution that would solve the unrest. However, while it is politically
plausible for a government to take any action which it hopes to produce such an effect, the issues for
the present Tribunal are whether the unrest was caused by or can be attributed to Claimant and
whether Respondents action depriving Claimant of the rights it had been granted by Supreme Decree

083 was legally justified.

In PO-10, the Tribunal requested that the Parties to reply to the following question at section 2.1.4.
(a) (iii): What actions were legally required of Claimant in seeking to obtain a Social License, and
did the Claimant take these actions? Further, in PO-10, the Tribunal requested that the Parties to reply
to the following question 2.1.4.(a) (iv): Jn the present case, what were the State authorities’

responsibilities in relation to obtaining a Social License?

In response to that first question, Claimant describes in detail the actions it undertook*!? and the

Tribunal appreciates that its many efforts included a variety of actions of outreach to the local

519 CPHB-I pp. 5-18.

ICSID ARB/14/21 135

communities both on its own and in cooperation with Respondent’s authorities. Respondent argues

that these actions were not sufficient to fulfill the legal requirements.*°

404. Indeed, the Tribunal considers that actions beyond those that Claimant undertook would have been

possible and feasible.

405. The events in 2008 show that opposition to the Project was expressed clearly and repeatedly by certain

sectors of the local community, and that opposition focused not only on the Project but also on the

role of Claimant:

. May 4, 2008: one of Claimant’s staff members was attacked and threatened in the
Kelluyo District, in the course of efforts to explain the company’s environmental
management programme;~”!

. September 4, 2008: Claimant’s employees were physically detained in the
Ancomarca Community for several hours, as more support and extra services for
local communities were demanded;*””

. October 14, 2008: There was continued unrest, including looting and burning of a
campsite of Claimant’s. In the process, the Community Relations Manager at Santa
Ana was forced to crawl and say (while being filmed) that “the foreigners must
leave and not return.”** In the interview he also states that since he joined the
company in 2004, there had always been opposition to Santa Ana from the
leaders/groups that caused the disturbances in October 2008.°*4

international instruments are clear that consultations with indigenous communities are to be made

public necessity declaration, Claimant listed 5 communities as falling within the Project’s area of

direct influence and 21 communities within the Project’s indirect area of influence.*”° Claimant

continuously emphasized — including at the Hearing — that it went far beyond the minimum
requirements of Article 4 of Ministerial Resolution No. 304°” by, amongst others, conducting over
130 community outreach workshops. Still, the question remains whether Claimant took the
appropriate and necessary steps to engage all of the relevant and likely to be affected local
communities, and whether its approach contributed significantly to the nature and extent of the

opposition that followed. Relevant evidence includes, for example:

. Exhibit C-155: report on workshops held in 2009, it was recommended that more
workshops be carried out to avoid social conflict,** as “the community does not
trust” the company, due to a lack of information and workshops.*”?

. The jobs/rotational programme was implemented in a manner that purposely sought
to benefit only those communities in close proximity to the Project, and appears to
have been implemented as a means to compensate those local communities for land
use rights. More distant communities, including those likely to be affected by water
use and contamination, were not brought into the process and offered work or other
forms of recompense.**”

407. On the basis of the evidence it appears that support for the Project came from communities that were
receiving some form of benefits (i.e. jobs, direct payments for land use, etc.) and that those
communities that remained silent or objected were either not receiving benefits, were uninformed, or

both.

408. While Claimant could have gone further in its outreach activities, the relevant question for the
Tribunal is whether Respondent can claim that such further outreach was legally required and its

absence caused or contributed to the social unrest, so as to justify Supreme Decree 032.

409. The Tribunal notes that, at least early in 2011, Respondent’s authorities were aware of the community

discontent as is shown in communications to Government authorities:

. October 2010: four months before the public hearing in February 2011, the Kelluyo
District wrote to the office of the Ombudsman of Puno, informing them that they
would hold a meeting on October 24, 2010, with “a mining company called
‘Proyecto Santa Ana” and requesting the presence of a Puno official to clarify the
issue of mining. Another letter followed later in November 2010, indicating that
another meeting would take place on January 9, 2011 and requesting that a mining
activities workshop be conducted. In the letter, the community still referred to
Claimant as “a mining company called ‘Proyecto Santa Ana”.**! This appears to
confirm that even at that late stage, a number of relevant communities were being
contacted only for the first time, that the process of obtaining the necessary “social
license” was far from complete, and that some communities were still unclear about
who was driving the Project.

. March 2011: a memorial to the President, submitted by communities from
Chucuito, El Collao, Puno and Yunguyo requesting (amongst others) that the EIA
be cancelled, on grounds of fears of pollution:5* “the permanent withdrawal of the
Bear Creek Mining Company (Santa Ana Mining Project) and their removal from
the area to prevent confrontations with the local residents that could later occur in
all above-mentioned jurisdictions[]”;>>

. March 11, 2011: letter from Kelluyo/Alto Aracachi Quluyo Community to Puno
officials™ stating that a certain public meeting was a closed-door meeting, which
meant that not everyone could participate, that questions were not sufficiently
addressed, and that Claimant had not previously offered information on
developments;

. April 25, 2011: a previously threatened strike began in City of Desaguadero, after
the Regional President refused to sign an ordinance prohibiting all mining activities
in the south of Puno;

. April 26, 2011: Regional President of Puno asked the central Government to
intervene by suspending the activities of the Santa Ana Project run by Claimant;
the letter to Minister of Energy and Mines, referenced discontent and rejection in
district of Kelluyo and reported concerns voiced by affected communities, which
included lack of transparency and due consultation.**

410. For its legal evaluation, the Tribunal agrees with the Abengoa Award, in which the tribunal held:
“For the international responsibility of a State to be excluded or reduced based on the investor's
omission or fault, it is necessary not only to prove said omission or fault, but also to establish a causal
link between [the omission or fault] and the harm suffered. In other words, for the argument to
succeed, there must be evidence that if a social communication program had been timely implemented
since 2003, the 2009 and 2010 events that led to the loss of the Claimants’ investment would not have

occurred.”**6

411. In the view of the Tribunal, Respondent has not been able to prove such a causal link between
Claimant's activity in relation to its Santa Ana Project and Supreme Decree 032. Rather, the evidence
shows that Respondent’s various authorities involved in the procedure were aware of and did not
object to Claimant’s outreach activities and, from the very beginning until before the meeting of June

2011, approved and often even endorsed these:

. At the Hearing, Claimant’s witness Anttinez de Mayolo testified: “One last
question: Prior to the enactment of Supreme Decree 032, did the Peruvian
Government ever advise Bear Creek that the execution of its citizen-participation
mechanisms was inadequate? A. Never. We were never told anything.”**"

. Claimant worked with MINEM, DREM, and health and education representatives
of the Puno region to organize activities for the communities to improve their
education and training.***

. At MINEM's request, DREM or the local authorities at DREM's direction, chaired
the five workshops organized by Claimant.**? As confirmed by Respondent’s
witness Ramirez Delpino, neither MINEM nor DREM ever informed Claimant of
any concerns they may have had regarding the workshops.*"°

. Supreme Decree 028 provided that DGAAM was responsible for reviewing, in the
first instance, both the executive summary and the CPP, and had the authority to
make “observations or order[] any amendments or changes that may be
required.”™' By December 2010, Claimant had conducted over 130 workshops in
a total of 18 communities within the direct and indirect areas of influence, as well
as meetings with national, regional, and local authorities, to the district of
Huacullani, the district of Kelluyo, province of Chucuito as confirmed by
Respondent’s witness Antinez de Mayolo.*? On December 23, 2010, Bear Creek
submitted to DGAAM its ESIA for the exploitation phase, along with the Executive
Summary and the CPP.**

. In December 2010, the OEFA visited Santa Ana and the OEFA Report No. 008-
2010 expressly stated: “Relations with the communities located around the Santa
Ana Exploration Project area have not caused any kind of social conflict, in what
can be construed as a very friendly relationship.”**

. On January 7, 2011, DGAAM approved Claimant’s CPP and the Executive
Summary of its ESIA for exploitation.*4* Mr. Ramirez Delpino testified that
DGAAM could have rejected the Executive Summary or the CPP instead of
approving either, but that in this case, both documents complied with all applicable
regulations, and DGAAM had raised no concerns.*° In this context, the Tribunal

notes that DGAAM determined expressly that the citizen participation mechanisms

the execution of the mining project were “appropriate to the particular
characteristics of the mining activity area of influence, of the project and its
magnitude and the relevant population in accordance with Article No. 6 of Supreme
Decree No. 028[.]”*"

. In preparation of the Public Hearing, on January 21, 2011, Mr. Anttinez de Mayolo
informed DGAAM that Claimant had complied with all requirements.*“*

. The public hearing took place on February 23, 2011. It was chaired by Kristiam
Veliz Soto, a MINEM attorney, who was assisted by Jestis Obed Alvarez Quispe,
President of DREM. A Special Prosecutor for Environmental Matters, Dr.
Alejandro Tapia Gémez, also attended. By the contemporaneous accounts in the
evidence, the public hearing was a success. MINEM even issued a press release
after the public hearing indicating that the event had ended satisfactorily. “?
Respondent has alleged that the hearing was not satisfactory, but it has neither
produced the video made of the hearing or produced evidence of any participant in
the hearing.*° Therefore, the Tribunal sees no sufficient evidence which would
show that the conduct and results of the hearing would not comply with the legal
requirements.

. Vice-Minister of Energy and Mines Fernando Gala wrote in his aide-memoire that
Claimant “had no problems when it held the public hearing for the [ESIA] of the
Santa Ana project in Huacullani on February 23, 2011.”

. At a meeting on May 17, 2011, Mr. Ramirez Delpino described “the harmonious

. At the Hearing in this arbitration, Mr. Ramirez Delpino confirmed that if DE6AAM

have ordered Claimant to hold additional workshops after the public hearing.**?

. In May 2011, Vice-Minister Gala publicly acknowledged that revoking Supreme
Decree 083 would be “completely illegal|.]”°™*

412. The evidence summarized above shows that from the very beginning until the time before the meeting
of June 23, 2011, all outreach activities by Claimant were known to Respondent’s authorities and
were conducted with their approval, support, and endorsement, and that no objections were raised by
the authorities in this context. While, as mentioned above, further actions by Claimant would have
been feasible, on the basis of the continued coordination with and support by Respondent’s
authorities, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant could take it for granted to have complied with all
legal requirements with regard to its outreach to the local communities. Respondent, after its
continuous approval and support of Claimant’s conduct, cannot in hindsight claim that this conduct
was contrary to the ILO Convention 169 or was insufficient, and caused or contributed to the social

unrest in the region.

413. This conclusion is confirmed by the decision of First Constitutional Court of Lima which confirmed
the validity of Supreme Decree 083 and, in particular, in its reasoning in the chapter titled NINTH:
Concerning the hindrance of the principle of legal security the following is set out: expressed in

subsection 5:

The issuance of Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM that derogates the decree cited in the
previous paragraph, as previously analyzed, does not impute responsibility whatsoever
upon the claimant, rather it lacks proper reasoning, as it attributes its issuance to
‘circumstances that would imply the disappearance of the legally required conditions for
the issuance of the mentioned act.’ Namely, it does not set out the circumstances (based on
the publications one deduces that these would be the violent demonstrations and illicit
attacks on public and private property in the Puno department) and, with respect to the
disappearance of the conditions, the cited decree is drafted using an uncertain conditional
[conjugation] ‘would imply’; therefore the issuance of Supreme Decree No. 032-2011-EM
is an action by the State that is not found within the margins of reasonability and
proportionality, required not to violate the principle of legal security. Given that, as
mentioned, these circumstances are not attributable to the claimant, in which case, the
issuance of a decree such as the one issued would be justifiable if it had been the claimant
who committed or omitted actions that implied the disappearance of the required conditions
and from the reading thereof one cannot observe in the cited decree any of these reasons.
Namely, there is no justified purpose for bringing an action by the State to reverse the rights
granted to BEAR CREEK MINING COMPANY SUCURUSAL DEL PERU, which were

granted in fulfillment of the corresponding procedures and complying with the necessary
requirements.*°>
In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that also the second reason given in
Supreme Decree 032, i.e. “the purpose of safeguarding the environmental and social conditions”,
discussed by the Parties as “social unrest’, does not justify the derogation of Supreme Decree 083

and that, therefore, neither of the two reasons given in the Decree can be a basis for the derogation.

(vi) Conclusion regarding the indirect expropriation

From the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the three “factors” expressly provided in

Annex 812.1(b) of the FTA for the identification of an indirect expropriation are fulfilled:

. in application of subsection (i), there is an “economic impact” as Supreme Decree
032 has an adverse effect on the economic value of Claimant’s investment,

. in application of subsection (ii), Supreme Decree 032 interferes with Claimant’s
distinct, reasonable investment-backed expectations,

. in application of subsection (iii), the character of the measure did not justify the
taking, because Supreme Decree 032 was based on reasons which have been found
to be illegal according to Peruvian law and do not justify a breach of the FTA.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that Supreme Decree 032 was an indirect expropriation in the sense

of Article 812 and Annex 812.1 of the FTA.

3. Whether Supreme Decree 032 Effected a Direct Expropriation
(a) Claimant’s Arguments

Regardless of whether it is classified as a direct or an indirect expropriation, Supreme Decree 032
constitutes an illegal taking of property.**° Supreme Decree 032 revoked Claimant’s right to acquire
and own the Santa Ana concessions that Supreme Decree 083 embodied. Supreme Decree 083 was
the sine qua non of the entire Santa Ana Project — and, as Prof. Bullard explains, it was an intrinsic
and essential component of Claimant’s property right in the Santa Ana Project. Without Supreme

Decree 083, Claimant is not permitted to conduct any activity in connection with the concessions.

$6 CG 242.

ICSID ARB/14/21 143

According to Respondent, Claimant has nothing more than an inoperative nominal title. **7
Respondent’s revocation of Supreme Decree 083 constitutes a forcible and unlawful taking of

Claimant’s property, for which Respondent must compensate Claimant. **

The legality of
Respondent’s direct expropriation of Claimant’s investment must be measured against Article 812,

and Claimant incorporates its arguments related to these legal requirements by reference.*”

418. Respondent is incorrect when it argues that Claimant’ s direct expropriation claim fails because “direct
expropriation requires transfer of title” and Claimant retains title.* Supreme Decree 083, however,
granted Claimant more than a mere “right to apply for permission to develop and eventually operate
a silver mine”, as alleged by Respondent. It granted Claimant the right to acquire, own, and possess
the Santa Ana concessions after making a finding that the Santa Ana Project constituted a public
necessity. Respondent’s own official documents — including the Lima First Constitutional Court’s

decision — confirm that Supreme Decree 083 granted Claimant a distinct set of rights to:

. “[E]xplore and exploit mineral resources granted.”

. “[U]se and enjoyment of the natural resource granted and, consequently, the
property of the fruits and products that are extracted.”

. “[A] right in rem ... consist[ing] of the sum of the attributes that this law recognizes
in favor of the concessionaire.

. These rights are irrevocable provided the holder meets the obligations that this law
or special legislation requires to maintain its validity.*"'

419. Supreme Decree 083, thus, is a fundamental component of Claimant’s property right.°

420. The tribunal in Enron v. Argentina recognized that direct expropriation requires the transfer of an
essential component of property rights, and this is precisely what Supreme Decree 032 did when it

revoked Claimant’s right to own the i Accordingly, Sup Decree 032 breaches the

 

FTA’s prohibition on unlawful expropriation.**

421. The FTA does not define direct expropriation, but the concept is understood in international law as a
“forcible taking by the Government of tangible or intangible property” an intent, reflected in a formal
decree or act, to deprive the owner of property through transfer of title or seizure. Other
international tribunals have applied direct expropriation standards even where the measure at issue

involves the revocation of a decree or the effect of transferring title to concessions to the State.*°

422. Supreme Decree 032 openly, directly, and intentionally revoked Claimant’s right to acquire, possess,
and operate the Concessions, rendering Claimant’s title, in Respondent’s words, “inoperative.”*©°
Supreme Decree 032 permanently divested Claimant of its rights to the Santa Ana concessions and,

thus, resulted in the entire Project shutting down.*”

423. Finally, “Supreme Decree 032 had the effect of transferring title of the mining concessions to Peru
..[As] Article 71 itself provides, the consequence of a foreigner’s having property within 50
kilometers of the border without having the required authorization is not only the impossibility of

engaging in mining activity but also the complete forfeiture of the right to the State.’** Due to

Respondent’s conduct, Claimant cannot even sell the right of ownership to third parties, since its

property is unauthorized and has been declared illegal by the State.

(b) Respondent’s Arguments

424. As the El Paso v. Argentina tribunal clarified, a direct expropriation requires a transfer of title.
Supreme Decree 032 involves no transfer of ownership — it merely revokes Supreme Decree 083,
which authorized Claimant to acquire mining concessions. Claimant retains title to the Santa Ana
concessions, albeit under the cloud of MINEM’s lawsuit which, if successful, would revert the
concessions to Respondent as Article 71 specifies. Claimant has not argued that the MINEM Lawsuit

is an expropriatory act.*”°

425. An argument that the MINEM inefficacy proceeding is an expropriatory act would be untenable.
First, the MINEM case is years away from resolution, and a claim based on a possible future
deprivation is unripe. Second, MINEM is seeking annulment — i.e., a ruling that Claimant did not
lawfully receive the concession rights in the first place. Should MINEM prevail, the ruling would
not take anything from Claimant, as it would declare Claimant never lawfully received the Santa Ana
concessions. There can be no claim for expropriation of property that one never owned. Thus, neither

the MINEM suit nor Supreme Decree 032 can amount to a direct expropriation.*”!

426. Even if the Tribunal were to determine that Supreme Decree 032 was expropriatory, Claimant’s
expropriation claim would nonetheless be limited to the rights it actually possessed, namely, the right
to obtain the right to mine at the site. At the time of the alleged expropriation, Claimant had obtained
none of the approvals necessary for the exploitation phase of the Project — it was in the early stages

of applying for the regulatory approvals and land use agreements (from 4 affected communities and

more than 90 land possessors) that would be necessary to build and operate a mine. The regulatory
path is difficult and most junior mining companies never progress beyond the regulatory approval
phase. As other stalled mining projects in Peru illustrate, community opposition can thwart a project

572

even when the mining company has an ESIA approval in hand.

427. Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument that it “owned” the rights to “Explore and exploit mineral

resources granted’ and “Use and enjoyment of the natural resource granted and, consequently, the
property of the fruits and products that are extracted.”*" Claimant’s argument appears to be that,
although it is not allowed to build or operate a mine and could not be sure of obtaining permission to
do so even in the absence of Supreme Decree 032, Claimant nonetheless owns the right to do so. This
position is based “on tortured readings of obscure provisions of Peruvian law, is confused, confusing

99574

and illogical.

428. Even if Claimant believed it held a contingent, future right, that would be of no help to Claimant.

The Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine tribunal was clear claims based on a provisional future right are
not cognizable. Claimant may only base its expropriation claim on rights that it held at the time of
the alleged expropriation and, here, Claimant only held the exclusive right to attempt to obtain the

right to mine at Santa Ana.*”

(c) The Tribunal’s Reasoning

429. The Tribunal has found above that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an indirect expropriation.

Therefore, there is no need to examine whether it also constituted a direct expropriation. The Parties
have not presented arguments related to the legal consequences of a finding of a direct expropriation,

and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those that follow from an indirect expropriation.

4, Whether Supreme Decree 032 was Lawful under Article 812 of the FTA
(a) Claimant’s Arguments

430. The following discussion was also relevant to Claimant’s answer to the Tribunal’s question (e) “What
are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if it were to conclude that:
(i) the Claimant's alleged investment was lawfully expropriated?”*”* Pursuant to Article 812 of the
FTA, an expropriation can only be lawful if it is carried out for a public purpose, in accordance with
due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner, and upon payment of prompt, adequate, and

effective compensation. None of these elements has been met here.>””

431. Regarding the first element, an expropriation cannot be lawful unless it is taken for a “public

8

purpose”, interpreted in accordance with international law. *”* Respondent cannot determine

unilaterally what public purpose means by reference to its own domestic legal order. The need for a

public purpose or public interest to legitimatize an expropriation has long been considered part of
customary international law, and the requirement can be found in almost all investment agreements.*””
It is a genuine requirement, and the ADC v. Hungary tribunal cautioned against considering a “mere

reference to ‘public interest” as sufficient evidence. British Petroleum y. Libya concluded that an

expropriation was unlawful because it had been adopted for purely extraneous political reasons and,
hence, not for a public purpose. In LETCO v. Liberia, an ICSID tribunal found that the revocation of

a concession was not for a public purpose because there was no stated policy that concessions could

be taken for the public good.**! Here, Respondent cobbles together a series of events that appear to
have the veneer of legitimate public purpose, so as to justify the issuance of Supreme Decree 032.
Not one of Respondent’s ex post facto justifications for issuing Supreme Decree 032 — including (1)
protecting health and safety of citizens, (2) preserving relations with neighboring states, and (3)
protecting the integrity of Respondent’s constitutional process — was actually considered when
Supreme Decree 032 was issued. Even Respondent admits that, it was not “until a Congressman
presented documents disclosing” a purported non-compliance with Article 71 that Respondent found
areason to issue Supreme Decree 032. Thus, all of the important purposes that Respondent referenced
for its issuance of Supreme Decree 032 are nothing more than ex post facto justifications that the

Tribunal should disregard.**?

432. As explained above, Supreme Decree 032 was taken to placate controversial political opposition led

583

by Mr. Aduviri — not for a public purpose.**’ Notwithstanding the clear political nature of the protests,

Respondent first responded by issuing a 12-month suspension of Claimant’s ESIA evaluation process
inresponse. Mr. Aduviri announced a suspension of the indefinite strike until June 7, 201 1, to prevent
interference with voting in the run-off presidential election opposing Ollanta Humala to Keiko
Fujimori. Mr. Aduviri continued to urge the Peruvian Government to revoke Supreme Decree 083

and, when he resumed the strikes on June 7, 2011, this directly led to the issuance of Supreme Decree

032 on June 25, 2011.°** The Amparo Decision makes it clear that Respondent did not enact Supreme

Decree 032 for a public purpose, but rather that the Santa Ana Project remained a public necessity at

all relevant times and that it did not cause any environmental issue or social unrest in the area. The

violent demonstrations had nothing to do with Claimant’s actions or omissions. It is, thus, clear that
no public purpose justifying the expropriation of Claimant’s rights over the Santa Ana Project existed

when the Government issued Supreme Decree 032.***

433. According to Peruvian law, the property or possession rights granted to foreigners in border areas
may be restricted only for reasons of national security.**° Here, Supreme Decree 032 says nothing
about (i) why mining in the border area no longer constitutes a public necessity, (ii) Respondent’s
need to restore order throughout the region, or (iii) how the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 was a
necessary and proportionate measure to achieve Respondent’s purported needs. Indeed, the
vagueness of the document, as well as Respondent’s acknowledgement that no contemporaneous
documents that could explain what could constitute “new circumstances” justifying the issuance of
Supreme Decree 032 exist, demonstrate its lack of a legitimate public purpose. Here, Respondent is
simply asking the Tribunal to deduce, based on media reports and ex post facto justifications, that the
demonstrations led to the issuance of Supreme Decree 032. Respondent’s officials, however, have

admitted that Respondent “had no reason to remove the concession from the company.”**"

434. Respondent’s legal framework does not authorize expropriations in order to avoid social conflict.

Accordingly, the derogation of Supreme Decree 083 “Jacks proper reasoning” and “is not found
within the margins of reasonability and proportionality required not to violate the principle of legal

security.”

435. Claimant’s situation is similar to claimant’s in Tecmed v. Mexico, where claimant argued that

respondent expropriated its investment by refusing to renew claimant’s authorization to operate a
landfill. In examining whether respondent’s measures were reasonable, that tribunal stated that “there
must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the charge or weight imposed to the
foreign investor and the aim sought to be realized by any expropriatory measure.” In addition to
finding that claimant’s operations did not “pose a present or imminent risk to the ecological balance
or to people’s health”, the Tecmed tribunal found that it relevant that the protests did not have
claimant’s behavior as their origin. Finding that there had been no serious urgent situation, crisis,
need, or social emergency, the Tecmed tribunal found that opposition to the landfill and pressure on
authorities were not sufficient justifications for the State to deprive claimant of its investment without

compensation. This Tribunal could make the same finding here.**°

436. Regarding the second element of Article 812, a lawful expropriation or nationalization of a protected

 

investment must take place in accordance with due process of law.*”” Respondent’s silence on this

issue confirms that Claimant simply was not afforded due process in connection with the issuance of

Supreme Decree 032. Respondent failed to observe due process when enacting Supreme Decree 032

in five ways:

i) Supreme Decree 032 was not the proper way to repeal Supreme Decree 083—an
administrative act that could not be derogated—and rescind Bear Creek's right to
own mines and mining rights in Santa Ana;

(ii) Supreme Decree 032 was not issued in the context of any defined legal procedure
within MINEM;

(iii) Bear Creek never received advance notice of Supreme Decree 032 or an
opportunity to be heard;

(iv) the Government did not provide any credible justification for Supreme Decree
032; and

) Supreme Decree 032 violated the legal principles of legal security and
prohibition of arbitrariness, as recognized by the Lima First Constitutional
Court.**!

437. Respondent’s measures were disproportionate the public interest presumably protected. That other

measures of general application were adopted at the same time only highlights Respondent’s political
motivations in targeting Claimant. Respondent failed to allow these general measures to play out

before singling out Respondent in its political game.*””

438. Under Peruvian law, once rights or interests have been conferred on a private party, they cannot be

modified or substituted for “reasons of opportunity, merit or convenience.” Since Claimant was not
granted an opportunity to be heard before Supreme Decree 032 was issued, it constitutes a deviation
of power, which contravenes the principles of legality and reasonability. Further, as confirmed in the
Amparo decision, Supreme Decree 032 lacks proper reasoning and motivation and thus violates the

prohibition on arbitrariness. Accordingly, this Tribunal should find that Respondent acted arbitrarily

and in violation of due process of law when it issued Supreme Decree 032, which expropriated

Claimant’s rights.°°?

439. Regarding the third element of Article 812 of the FTA, discriminatory measures are not lawful.
Supreme Decree 032 targeted only Claimant and no other mining company lost its right to mine under
Supreme Decree 032. Arguments related to discrimination are presented above and are incorporated

here by reference.”

440. Regarding the final element of Article 812 of the FTA, Respondent’s expropriatory measures were
not taken against prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. Articles 812.2 and 812.3 provide
conditions that such compensation must meet in order to be considered “prompt, adequate, and
effective.” Pursuant to these, Respondent is required to pay, without delay, compensation to Claimant
in the amount of the FMV of the Santa Ana Project, plus interest from the date of the expropriation
until payment. It is undisputed that Respondent has not paid any form of compensation to Claimant
and, therefore, Respondent’s expropriation of the Santa Ana Project is an unlawful act under the FTA

and international law.°”>

(b) Respondent’s Arguments

of its other arguments. Respondent denies all allegations not specifically admitted.*°°

(c) The Tribunal’s Reasoning
Article 812.1 of the FTA provides:

Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly, or
indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation
(hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”), except for a public purpose, in accordance
with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and on prompt, adequate and
effective compensation.*"
The conditions set out in Article 812.1 are cumulative. By this wording, it is clear that if there is no
due process of law or if there has not been payment of “prompt, adequate and effective

compensation”, a direct or indirect act of expropriation will violate the FTA.

The Tribunal has already indicated above its appreciation that Respondent did not invite Claimant to
the meetings between June 20 and 23, 2011, on the basis that Claimant’s attendance might have made
the discussion with the groups organizing the social unrest more difficult and the Government was

under strong political pressure to find an agreeable solution.

But the Tribunal has also described the rushed procedure during the meeting of June 23, 2011. On
the basis of new documents allegedly presented between 9 and 10 p.m. —and which are said to have
been lost thereafter so that they could not be produced by Respondent in this arbitration — after an
examination by unidentified persons, according to Respondent by 1:30 a.m., between 15 and 19
Ministers of the Council of Ministers had been reached. Those Ministers were apparently contacted
and then approved the draft without seeing the alleged documents. Thereafter, the President of the
Republic signed the Supreme Decree. It is not disputed that no effort was made to contact Claimant
in advance, and that Claimant was given no opportunity to comment before Supreme Decree 032 was

issued.

As concluded above, the Supreme Decree 032 effected an indirect expropriation by revoking Supreme
Decree 083. The Tribunal considers that, even in the face of the obvious political pressure to which
the demonstrations and unrest gave rise, Claimant was entitled to be heard before such a fundamental
decision was to be considered and taken. This is all the more so in circumstances in which the

decision taken was expressly — in Supreme Decree 032 — based on allegedly unconstitutional conduct

by Claimant in the process of obtaining the rights granted by Supreme Decree 083. Respondent
should have made an effort to contact and hear Claimant, even in the face of political pressure to
come to an expeditious solution. The Tribunal has been presented with no evidence to explain why
this could not have happened, and why it did not happen. It has also not been shown whether, rather
than a derogation, a mere suspension of Claimant’s rights, as it was shortly thereafter ordered by
Supreme Decree 033, which suspended all other new mining concession requests in Puno, might have
been sufficient to calm the social unrests. It is not this Tribunal’s task to determine whether under
Peruvian law such a procedure might have been legally possible for other reasons as those given in
Supreme Decree 032. The Tribunal, however, has to apply Article 812.1 of the FTA, which expressly
provides that an expropriation must be done in accordance with due process of law. The process of

issuing Supreme Decree 032 does not comply with this requirement.

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent is in breach of the FTA by issuing Supreme Decree

032 without granting Claimant due process of law.

Further, Article 812.1 of the FTA provides that an expropriation, in order to be lawful, must be
effected in a non-discriminatory manner and on prompt, adequate and effective compensation. It is
undisputed that Supreme Decree 032 did not provide for any compensation to Claimant. Therefore,
also for this reason, the Decree is a breach of the FTA. In view of the above conclusions, it is not
necessary for the Tribunal to examine whether it was also issued in a non-discriminatory manner,

because such a finding would not change or add to the legal consequences of the measure.

In view of its above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an

unlawful indirect expropriation, in violation of Article 812.1 of the FTA.

5. Whether Supreme Decree 032 was a Valid Exercise of Police Powers
(a) Claimant’s Arguments

International arbitral tribunals have the jurisdiction — and the duty — to determine whether the

measures issued violate international obligations.***

58 C-IIG 290.

ICSID ARB/14/21 155

451. Respondent’s defense that Supreme Decree 032 was not expropriatory because it is a legitimate
exercise of Respondent’s police powers fails. The exercise of sovereign police powers is not a
complete defense to expropriation under the FTA and, in any event, the State’s police powers are not
unlimited. A lawful expropriation under the FTA must comply with Article 812(1) of the FTA, which
expressly circumscribes any exercise of Respondent’s police powers to so-called regulatory
conduct.” Supreme Decree 032 cannot be considered an appropriate exercise of police powers, as
it was issued without notice to Claimant, in violation of Claimant’s right of defense, and without

payment of compensation and the application of due process.°”

452. The police powers doctrine is not a generally applicable fixture of international investment arbitration
that allows States to regulate without compensating property owners. Contrary to Respondent’s
arguments, the Tecmed tribunal acknowledged the existence of the police powers doctrine on the
domestic plane and affirmed its duty to examine whether the measures there at issue violated the
treaty or international law. That tribunal then interpreted the BIT and found that regulatory actions
and measures will not be initially excluded from expropriatory acts.%! To determine whether the
sovereign powers doctrine has any role to play in the present analysis, the Tribunal must interpret and
apply the FTA, which does not excuse expropriations resulting from the exercise of police powers.”

Interpreting the FTA according to its ordinary meaning, as per Article 31(1) of the VCLT, there are

four specific elements that must be met for an expropriation to be deemed lawful: the expropriation

must be effected (i) for a public purpose, (ii) in accordance with due process of law, (iii) in a non-
discriminatory manner and (iv) on prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. Regulatory actions
are not excluded from the definition. Absent this express carve-out, the legality of Respondent’s

expropriation of Claimant’s investment can only be assessed against these four elements. Since

Respondent failed to comply with these four requirements, it is liable for carrying out an unlawful

expropriation.°°>

453. Respondent accepts that the police power has limits and does not enable States to regulate and
expropriate with impunity. The cases cited by Respondent, including 7za Yap Shum v. Peru confirm
that a State may only exercise its regulatory authority under certain conditions, including ensuring
that a measure is proportional to is objective and observes due process.“ The Lima First
Constitutional Court, as well as other Peruvian authorities, has recognized that Supreme Decree 032
was an arbitrary measure, not proportional to its objective, and was issued without due process of
law.®> Even if this Tribunal were to analyze this case under the police powers doctrine, it should
conclude that Supreme Decree 032 was not a legitimate exercise of Respondent’s police powers and

it constitutes a breach of Respondent’s international obligations.

454. Supreme Decree 032 is a specifically targeted measure designed to divest Claimant of its investment
—and it, therefore, falls outside of the scope of the police powers doctrine.” The majority of cases
upon which Respondent relies are inapposite, as they concern regulatory actions of general

application. Here, the conduct at issue is a targeted decree directed at a single company.®* Neither

the Jnvesmart nor the Saluka cases support Respondent’s position that the police powers exception
can apply in cases concerning the revocation of permission granted to a single investor.“ In
Invesmart, where the revocation of Union Bank’s license was authorized by statute when a bank
admittedly faced illiquidity and an inability to continue operating, the tribunal considered that the
banking statute was “a bona fide non-discriminatory regulation aimed at the general welfare.”°" It
is in that context that the Jnvesmart tribunal stated that “investment treaties were never intended to

do away with their signatories’ right to regulate.”°"'

455. In further contrast to Jnvesmart, neither Article 71 of the Constitution nor Supreme Decree 083 lays

out the circumstances under which the revocation of Supreme Decree 083 would be permitted.
Instead, Supreme Decree 032 only makes a vague assertion that “circumstances have been made
known that would imply the disappearance of the legally required conditions for the issuance of
Supreme Decree 083.” Supreme Decree 032 was not enacted to implement a legal framework that
was set forth in Article 71 or even Supreme Decree 083. Respondent intentionally circumvented
Peruvian law establishing procedural and substantive requirements to revoke the authorization
granted by Supreme Decree 083 by labeling its decision a “derogation”, rather than an administrative
act.°!? The context of the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 makes it clear that Respondent arbitrarily

decided to deprive Claimant of its investment.°'? This is confirmed by statements of high ranking

456. Respondent's reliance on Saluka is likewise misplaced.*'® The Saluka tribunal, noting the lack of a
bright line test within the treaty, examined the context and circumstances of the measure at issue to
determine whether it was an expropriation, rather than a valid regulatory activity.°'” After reviewing
the reasoned measure at issue, the tribunal commented that the decision was “fully motivated” and
that it was confirmed by an administrative appellate board and by the City Court of Prague on two
occasions.°'* Here, Supreme Decree 032 is not reasoned or “well motivated.” It is vague and provides
no explanation as to what the alleged “new circumstances” that “would imply the disappearance of
the legally required conditions for the issuance of the mentioned act” are. Since there is no legislation
to cancel lawfully granted concessions, there is no factual or legal analysis whatsoever. A measure
derogating Supreme Decree 083 would be inadmissible and unconstitutional. Supreme Decree 032

was condemned — not confirmed — by the Lima First Constitutional Court. Accordingly, the Saluka

sovereign powers, must act in accordance with the rule of law. In this case, that requires — at minimum

458. As the tribunals in Saluka and ADC v. Hungary recognized, the sovereign powers doctrine is not

unlimited.*' Even where a State enjoys wide discretion, the State’s discretion cannot be exercised
arbitrarily. Even if Supreme Decree 032 were to fall within the scope of Respondent’s police powers,
there can be no doubt that Supreme Decree 032 was arbitrary, not proportional, and issued without

regard for due process.

(b) Respondent’s Arguments

459. Claimant bears the burden to show that Respondent’s regulatory actions were inconsistent with a

legitimate exercise of police powers.”

460. Investment tribunals have repeatedly held that a State is not liable for takings that may result from

legitimate exercises of a State’s inherent power to regulate for the protection of safety and public

order — the State’s police powers.°* The police powers doctrine is a fundamental tenet of

international law that applies even in the absence of an express reference thereto in the relevant
international instrument. As recognized as early as 1941 by Prof. Herz, the State’s right to exercise

626

its police power has been recognized by general international law.*° Prof. Christie®® explained that

a State’s reasons for a taking pursuant to the police powers doctrine need only be “valid and bear
some plausible relationship to the action taken’ and that “no attempt may be made to search deeper
to see whether the State was activated by some illicit motive.” The academic literature also recognizes

that the police powers doctrine allows the State to regulate for the common good without

7

compensating impacted property owners. °°’ Today, the doctrine is a fixture of international

investment arbitration.°* Claimant’s argument that this fundamental principle does not apply
because the FTA contains no express carve-out ignores the scope and reach of the police powers
doctrine, which provides an overarching exception for certain exercises of State action, beyond any
carve-out that might appear in a treaty. The Sa/uka tribunal even affirmed the applicability of the
police powers doctrine as a matter of customary international law. International tribunals have
repeatedly confirmed that the police powers exception applies, regardless of whether an explicit treaty
provision is present.©° Such an approach is consistent with the VCLT, which requires that the

interpretation of the FTA take into account “any relevant rules of international law applicable in the

relations between the parties.”°°

461. In support of its novel police powers theory, Claimant relies on Tecmed but states that the Tecmed
tribunal considered a treaty without an express police powers carve-out and found that the police
powers did not apply. Claimant misrepresents Tecmed, which confirmed that in addition to the
provisions of a treaty, the tribunal must resolve a dispute by applying international law provisions.
Tecmed considered whether the State action was expropriatory based on “the principle that the State’s
exercise of its sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause economic
damage to those subject to its powers as administrator without entitling them to any compensation.”
Tecmed does not support Claimant’s argument — it confirms the opposite.**!

462. Even if this Tribunal were to find that the police powers defense only applies where a treaty expressly
so states, Chapter 22 of the FTA contains a carve-out for measures that are necessary to protect human
life or health. This is precisely the kind of explicit, textual exception that Claimant states is necessary
for the police powers doctrine to apply.°*

463. The police powers doctrine applies to regulation of general application, as well as to measures that
enforce generally applicable statutes. Claimant’s argument that the police powers exception cannot
apply to measures directed at specific investors has no legal or factual support — and the Tribunal
should reject it for its lack of legal foundation. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that although Supreme
Decree 032 had elements that were specific in application, it (1) enforced the generally applicable
Article 71 of Peru’s Constitution and (2) provided that all mineral extraction in the districts of Puno
would be prohibited under forthcoming regulations. It is unclear how the police powers exception
would attach to Article 71 of the Constitution (as Claimant would admit), but not to Supreme Decree

032, a measure designed to uphold and enforce Article 71.°%

464. Respondent’s position that the police powers doctrine applies to measures of specific application
finds support in investment treaty jurisprudence. For example, in Jnvesmart, the tribunal held that
the State’s cancellation of a single banking license was a non-expropriatory, regulatory act, based on

“the customary international law notion that a deprivation can be justified if it results from the

exercise of regulatory actions aimed at the maintenance of public order.” It is clear that the Invesmart
tribunal applied the police powers doctrine to the specific license revocation and concluded that the

State did not expropriate the investment.°*

465. To the extent that Claimant tries to distinguish Jnvesmart on the basis that the legal framework under

which Supreme Decree 032 was issued is not comparable to the legal framework of that case, it is
worth noting that the Jnvesmart tribunal focused only on the regulators’ specific decision. Invesmart
did not turn on an analysis of the national legal framework and, therefore, Claimant’s suggested

distinction is irrelevant.°°

466. In Saluka, the tribunal found that a regulatory action against a single bank constituted substantial

deprivation, but that no compensation was due. Even if it were true that the procedures followed in
Saluka were more transparent than those followed by Respondent in revoking Claimant’s public
necessity declaration, that is wholly irrelevant to Claimant’s argument that the police powers
exception does not apply. The Sa/uka tribunal found that the measure that applied specifically to that
claimant was lawful. Thus, even if Supreme Decree 032 could be characterized as a specific
regulatory act, Claimant has failed to provide any basis to exclude specific regulatory acts from the

ambit of the police powers exception.

467. The police powers doctrine affords a margin of appreciation to the State’s sovereign choices.

Accordingly, Respondent’s decision to enact Supreme Decree 032 should be granted a “presumption
of legitimacy” or a “margin of appreciation.” The propriety of such deference is evidence in these
circumstances, where the Constitution confers upon the State’s highest Executive body the discretion

to assess questions of “public necessity” in light of external and internal national security interests.”

468. The S.D. Myers tribunal recognized the “high measure of deference that international law generally
extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.” In Levy v.
Pert, the tribunal agreed that “it is unacceptable for an Arbitral Tribunal to ‘step into the shoes’ of
any [State] organ and to ‘second-guess’ its actions.” Claimant, however, is asking this Tribunal to
step in the shoes of Peruvian authorities — a task beyond the Tribunal’s mandate. Claimant’s so-called
constitutional law expert argues that Respondent should have instead “imposed order through the
intercession of the National Police.” Not only is this after-the-fact second-guessing rejected in
international law, it demonstrates a lack of understanding of the policy decisions that Peruvian
authorities faced and a lack of consideration of Respondent’s historic use of its National Police, which

638,

has escalated conflicts and led to increasing injuries and deaths. Claimant’s suggestion that

Respondent should have issued a temporary measure is misleading: Respondent issued temporary
measures, including the 1-year suspension the DGAAM’s review of Claimant’s ESIA and the 1-year
suspension of the granting of mining concessions in the Puno area via Supreme Decree 026. These
failed to quell the protests. The protests continued until the Government enacted Supreme Decree
032.°* It is inappropriate for Claimant to suggest that Respondent should have relied on temporary
measures only, especially considering that Claimant challenged the temporary suspension of its ESIA
in Peruvian administrative courts and continues to challenge the same today as a breach of the FET

protections of the FTA.“°

469. The police powers doctrine applies because Respondent issued Supreme Decree 032 (1) to protect its

citizens in the face of months of violent protests that threatened their health and safety and

destabilized the international border and (2) to safeguard the integrity of its Constitution and
Respondent’s sovereignty over natural resources. The issuance of Supreme Decree 032 was
necessary to maintain international comity with Bolivia. These are legitimate justifications for the
invocation of the State’s police powers, and the Tribunal should reject Claimant’s expropriation
claim. Respondent’s sovereign, discretionary choice deserves deference under international law.
Claimant’s position that Supreme Decree 032 was adopted merely to placate a small political minority
led by Mr. Aduviri is simply nonsense. Supreme Decree 032 was issued by an outgoing Government
with only one month remaining in office. Claimant has not explained what political gain an outgoing

Government could have received from enacting the decree.!

470. It must be recalled that Claimant, as a mining company, was at least in part responsible for the social

64

unrest, as it is ible for blishing and maintaining positive hips with sur di

communities. Claimant’s favoring some groups over others created tension that manifested itself in
violent ways, including a 2008 attack on Claimant’s office and camp. Public opposition to the Santa
Ana Project grew and came to a violent head between March and June 2011. Faced with escalating
violence, increasingly widespread protests, and mounting threats to public safety, Respondent took
the appropriate actions. These included not only Supreme Decree 032, but also Supreme Decree 033,
which suspended all new mining concession requests in Puno. Respondent’s interventions were

effective in stopping the protests, strikes, and violence that had paralyzed the region.“

(c) The Tribunal’s Reasoning

471. In the present context, the Tribunal has taken note of the comments received from the Government
of Canada quoted above, particularly: “A State is not required to compensate an investment for any
loss sustained by the imposition of a non-discriminatory, regulatory measure designed and applied

to protect legitimate public welfare objectives.”

And: “A non-discriminatory measure that is
designed to protect legitimate public welfare objectives does not constitute indirect expropriation
except in rare circumstances where its impacts are so severe in the light of its purpose that it cannot
be reasonably viewed as having been adopted and applied in good faith.” The Tribunal does not
disagree with this general evaluation, but considers that it must be taken into account in the context

of the specific provisions provided in the FTA.
472. Article 2201.1 of the FTA provides for the following “Exceptions”:

3. For the purposes of Chapter Eight (Investment), subject to the requirement that
such measures are not applied in a manner that constitute arbitrary or unjustifiable
discrimination between investments or between investors, or a disguised restriction
on international trade or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed
to prevent a Party from adopting or enforcing measures necessary:

(a) to protect human, animal or plant life or health, which the Parties
understand to include environmental measures necessary to protect
human, animal or plant life or health;

(b) to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent
with this Agreement; or

(c) the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources.

473. The Tribunal considers that already the title of Article 2201 “General Exceptions” shows that
otherwise Chapter Eight (investment) remains applicable including its Articles 812 and, by the

express footnote to the title of Article 812, as well as Article 812.1. Further, the list is not introduced

by any wording (e.g. “such as”) which could be understood that it is only exemplary. It must therefore
be understood to be an exclusive list. Also in substance, in view of the very detailed provisions of
the FTA regarding expropriation (Article 812 and Annex 812.1) and regarding exceptions in Article
2201 expressly designated to “Chapter Eight (Investment)”, the interpretation of the FTA must lead
to the conclusion that no other exceptions from general international law or otherwise can be

considered applicable in this case.

There is, thus, no need to enter into the discussion between the Parties regarding the jurisprudence

concerning any police power exception for measures addressed to investments.

Even if, in view of the social unrest existing at the time one was to interpret Supreme Decree 032 as
falling under the above cited exception by Article 2201 as protecting human life or health, the
Tribunal takes particular note of the fact that Supreme Decree 032 makes no mention of such a
protection being the justification for the Decree. Rather, Supreme Decree 032 refers expressly only
to “circumstances” and “new circumstances” which allegedly have been made known at the meeting
of June 23, 2011, and to social unrest. As found above, neither of the two reasons relied upon in this
context justify Respondent’s derogation of Supreme Decree 083 and of the rights awarded to
Claimant therein, and Respondent cannot claim the social unrest to have been caused or contributed

to by Claimant.

It could be argued that Supreme Decree 032, which is addresses only the investment of Claimant by
derogating Supreme Decree 083, is not covered by Article 2201 because it may qualify for the express
exception from the Exception as an “arbitrary and unjustifiable discrimination between investments
or between investments[.]” But indeed, there was a provision in the Decree which, at least for the

future, envisaged more general application:

Supplementary Provision
Sole.— Provide that, under responsibility, in a term no greater than sixty (60) calendar days,
provisions are to be enacted for the purpose of prohibiting mining activities in the areas of
the Huacullani and Kelluyo districts in the Chucuito province of the Puno department.°
Further, the Tribunal notes that Respondent issued not only Supreme Decree 032, but also Supreme

Decree 033, which suspended all new mining concession requests in Puno, and that Respondent’s

479.

interventions seem to have been effective in stopping the protests, strikes, and violence that had
paralyzed the region. However, even if these two Decrees together would have to be considered as
justified by the exception in Article 2201 of the FTA, Respondent does not explain the other reasons
found above to be in breach of Article 812 of the FTA: Respondent has not explained that it was not
possible to hear Claimant before issuing Supreme Decree 032 and that the exception also justified the
breach of the due process obligation in Article 812 of the FTA. And, since the exception in Article
2201 does not offer any waiver from the obligation in Article 812 to compensate for the expropriation,
Respondent has also failed to explain why it was necessary for the protection of human life not to

offer compensation to Claimant for the derogation of Supreme Decree 083.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that, irrespective of a possible applicability of the Exception in
Article 2201 of the FTA, two of the breaches of Article 812 of the FTA found above remain and thus

Supreme Decree 032 must be considered a breach of the FTA.

Article 805: Minimum Standard of Treatment

Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including
fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.

The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security”
in paragraph I do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is
required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of
aliens.

A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this
Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there
has been a breach of this Article.

Article 808: Reservations and Exceptions
Articles 803, 804, 806 and 807 do not apply to:
(a)# any existing non-conforming measure that is maintained by
Wt a national government, as set out in its Schedule to Annex I, or
(ii)# a sub-national government;

(b)# — the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure
referred to in subparagraph (a); or

(c)# an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in
subparagraph (a) to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the
conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before the amendment,
with Articles 803, 804, 806 and 807.

Articles 803, 804, 806 and 807 do not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or
maintains with respect to sectors, sub-sectors or activities, as set out in its schedule
to Annex II.

Annex 804.1 Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment

For greater clarity, treatment “with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion,
management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments” referred to
in paragraphs I and 2 of Article 804 does not encompass dispute resolution mechanisms,
such as those in Section B, that are provided for in international treaties or trade

1. Whether Respondent Afforded Claimant Fair and Equitable Treatment as Required by
the FTA

(a) The Scope of Protection Offered by the International Minimum Standard of
Treatment (“MST”)

(i) The Government of Canada

480. Article 805 does not require treatment in addition to or beyond the MST. To establish the content of
the MST, one must turn to customary international law. The burden of proving a rule of customary
international law under Article 805 rests with the party invoking that provision, who must prove that
a specific rule regarding the treatment of the investor or its investment has crystallized into
widespread and consistent State practice flowing from a sense of legal obligation. The decisions and
awards of international courts and tribunal do not constitute instances of State practice, but are
relevant to the extent that they include an examination of State practice and opinio juris. In the words
of the tribunal in Cargill v. Mexico, these awards “do not create customary international law but

rather, at most, reflect [it].

(ii) Claimant’s Arguments

481. The Parties agree that, pursuant to Article 805 of the FTA, Respondent was obligated to accord

Claimant and its investment FET in accordance with the MST. The Parties disagree on the proper

propriety, or contravenes an investor’s legitimate expectations. This general standard was elaborated
by the Waste Management I tribunal and has been recognized by the recent Bilcon v. Canada and
Teco v. Guatemala tribunals as particularly influential. It is less burdensome than Neer and contains
no requirement that the challenged conduct reach the level of “shocking” or “outrageous” behavior,
though it holds that “a basic obligation of the State under Article 1105(1) [NAFTA] is to act in good
faith and form, and not deliberately set out to destroy or frustrate the investment by improper means.”
The MST standard grants a number of procedural rights to investors, including the right to access to
courts, the right to unbiased hearings, the right to participate in hearings, and the right to a judgment
in accordance with the law of the State within a reasonable time. Respondent has violated each of

these standards.°°

483. Respondent wants this Tribunal to apply a draconian, restrictive — and highly unfair and inequitable
— MST standard of “shocking” or “egregious” conduct from the Neer case. The Tribunal, however
should see this for what it is: an admission that Respondent violated the MST and an attempt to

escape liability through a regression of MST that would empty it of any real meaning.*!

484. Respondent’s position that Neer articulated any conception of the MST is flawed, as both case law
and scholarship reject the proposition that the Neer standard was ever an accurate statement of MST.
Even if it had generated an accurate statement of MST when it was decided in 1926, the standard has
evolved since then. The facts of Neer bear no relationship to the protection of foreign investment.
Rather, the issue in that case was whether a denial of justice had occurred. Far from reflecting the
MST, Neer is relevant only in cases of failure to arrest and punish private actors of crimes against
aliens. It may at most provide a statement of the customary international law understanding of denial
of justice in 1926. In its decision, the Neer tribunal stated that “the treatment of an alien, in order to
constitute an international delinquency, should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect
of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that
every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize the insufficiency.” The Neer tribunal
never intended to lay down a precise formula for determining when a State’s conduct is internationally
unacceptable. Leading scholars have considered that Neer and its progeny cannot be construed as a
reflection of the MST under customary international law. It analyzed neither State practice nor opinio

juris and the entirety of its reasoning and decision spans three pages.”

485. Article 805 of the FTA establishes the relationship between FET and MST. It does not reference the

Neer standard at all, and there is no language that stabilizes the legal framework of MST by fixing it
to the time of Neer (1926). Instead, Article 805 refers to the “customary international law” MST.
Customary international law has evolved since 1926 and will continue to do so. Tribunals applying
the FTA are, thus, obliged to apply the “contemporary” content of the MST, as reflected in customary
international law gleaned from, among others, the decisions of investment treaty tribunals applying

the MST.°3

486. Even if Neer was once an accurate statement of MST, the overwhelming majority of tribunals and

653

654

scholars agree that MST today is not what it was 90 years ago, as customary international law is an
evolving body of law. For example, the tribunal in Mondev v. USA — on the basis of State practice
and opinio juris as distilled from a survey of arbitral decisions, BITs, and many treaties of friendship
and commerce — analyzed MST in the context of a NAFTA claim and rejected the idea that MST
today is the same as the standard articulated in Neer. The tribunal in ADF Group v. U.S. agreed and
relied on Mondev. In ADF, the Government of Canada — a Contracting Party — submitted in that
proceeding that the MST has evolved since Neer, though it is still a high threshold. Based on its
thorough analysis of State practice, decisions and commentary on MST under NAFTA and other
international law authorities, the Merrill & Ring tribunal concluded that MST is broader today than

the standard defined in Neer and its progeny — and other tribunals, scholars, and practitioners agree.°*

487. Even the cases upon which Respondent relies, including Thunderbird and Cargill, recognize that

MST has evolved since Neer. The Thunderbird award affirmed the holding of Waste Management
JI on the point that, when analyzing the MST standard of FET, an investor’s legitimate expectations
are important. The Cargill award even noted that the FET standard in thousands of treaties may raise
international expectations about what constitutes good governance and quoted ADF and Mondev with
approval. Indeed, the Cargill tribunal’s understanding of MST is far more aligned with Claimant’s

position than with Respondent’s.°*

488. Respondent relies on the outlier case, Glamis, for the proposition that the Neer articulation of the

MST still supplies the accurate level of scrutiny. Even on its own terms, however, the Glamis
endorsement of the Neer level of scrutiny was tempered by that tribunal’s acknowledgement that
notions of the circumstances that constitute “outrageous” conduct have changed markedly since Neer.
In any event, Glamis cannot revive the Neer standard. In the most recent investment treaty award
that analyzed MST, Bilcoin v. Canada, the tribunal noted that NAFTA tribunals have moved away
from the position expressed in Glamis and toward a view that the MST has evolved towards greater

protection for investors.°°

489. The contemporary MST includes a broader set of protections than Neer. Although Respondent argues

that its actions must reach the level of “shocking” or “egregious” and must be indicative of “willful
neglect’ or “bad faith” to constitute a breach, the MST offers significantly more protections than
Respondent claims. For example, tribunals today unanimously reject the “bad faith” requirement

alleged by Respondent as a prerequisite for finding a breach of MST.°”

490. Claimant’s and Canada’s reading of Article 805 of the FTA are largely consistent with one another.

Both agree that arbitral awards may reflect customary international law and Claimant relied on such
awards — especially Waste Management IJ — to inform its discussion of the MST. Claimant explains
that, “/rJegarding the content of MST, Canada submits that customary international law does not
recognize a general duty of transparency or an obligation to protect the investor's legitimate
expectations. In other arbitrations, Canada has clarified its position, stating that transparency and
legitimate expectations are not standalone rights entitled to protection, but may be considered in the
overall analysis of alleged MST breaches.” This stands in contrast to Respondent’s position, where
legitimate expectations and transparency are irrelevant. MST, however, protects against a complete
lack of transparency, and an investor’s legitimate expectations are relevant to assess a breach of

MST.°

(iii) Respondent’s Arguments

491. In Article 805 of the FTA, the Contracting Parties agreed to guarantee FET up to — and not beyond —

the MST. The MST represents a low bar for States, but a high hurdle for would-be claimants. As
explained by Prof. Borchard and confirmed by the A/ Tamimi v. Oman tribunal, MST sets up an
absolute floor of treatment, which ensures that State action does not “fall below a civilized standard.”
Tribunals take a deferential approach when assessing State action under the MST, and the principle

of deference to a State’s sovereign choices should guide this Tribunal’s analysis.°°

492. Neer represents the historical root of MST, which subsequent tribunals have adopted and interpreted.

While this Tribunal is not bound to follow Neer to the letter, it should be cognizant of Neer’s place
as the foundation of modern MST - a foundation from which recent arbitral awards have not
strayed.°” Neer has been invoked by an array of investment tribunals. This collective jurisprudence
— including cases like Thunderbird v. Mexico (2006), Glamis Gold (2009) and even cases outside of
the NAFTA context, like Genin v. Estonia represents modern MST and establishes two points: (1)
Neer remains relevant to modern MST analysis and (2) the threshold for finding a violation of MST

remains high.*!

493. To clarify — it has not been Respondent’s position that the Tribunal may only consider Neer, rather,

that Neer remains relevant. Under Neer, establishing a breach of MST requires action that amounts
to “an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action

so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily

recognize its insufficiency. Respondent has never claimed that bad faith is required to substantiate

a MST breach. It is sufficient, but not required, to demonstrate a breach of the MST.

494, Claimant attempts to lower the bar to prove a breach of MST, arguing for a so-called “contemporary”

minimum standard. The cases cited, however, support Respondent’s position that MST presents a
high hurdle for claimants.% For example, Waste Management II (2004) does not support Claimant’ s
argument. By using adjective modifiers that evidence a strict standard, like “grossly”, “manifest”,
and “complete”, the Waste Management II tribunal recognized that claimants alleging violations of
the MST face a high burden. That tribunal dismissed claimant’s FET claims, reasoning that the
evidence presented did not support the conclusion that respondent acted in a “wholly” arbitrary or
“grossly unfair’ manner. The other cases cited by Claimant recognized that claimants alleging a

breach of the MST face a high burden.**

495. If the Tribunal is persuaded by Claimant’s argument that “newer is better” and the Tribunal should

662

663

664

665

666

give greater weight to more recent awards, the Tribunal could consider further cases not cited by
Claimant. For example, Mobil v. Canada (2012) held that the MST standard is “set [...] at a level
which protects against egregious behavior.”®* The strong language used in the Al Tamimi v. Oman

(2015) and in Cargill v. Mexico (2009) support Respondent’s core arguments that (1) the strict Neer

standard remains the foundation of MST jurisprudence and (2) this standard places a high burden on

claimants. Claimant has not and cannot meet this elevated standard.”

496. To demonstrate a breach of Article 805 of the FTA, Claimant must identify a specific rule of
customary international law that Respondent violated. Establishment of a rule of customary
international law requires a showing of (1) a concordant practice of a number of States acquiesced in
by others; and (2) a conception that this practice is required by or consistent with prevailing law
(opinio juris). The burden is on Claimant to prove the existence of a rule of customary international
law, and Claimant’s failure to identify such a rule persists to date. Absent a specific rule of customary
international law governing a specific type of conduct, States are free to regulate as they deem
appropriate.**

497. In a footnote, Claimant stated that “MST is the specific rule of international law governing the
Parties’ conduct’ and alleged that Respondent could not support its position that “proof of ‘specific
rules’ beyond the content of MST is required.” Respondent is not asking that Claimant prove
anything beyond the content of the customary international law MST. Rather, Respondent highlights
that Claimant has not proven the content of the MST, as is Claimant’s burden.°” Prior arbitral
decisions cannot be used to prove customary international law norms. Claimant's allusions to general
MST and its recitations of arbitral case law are insufficient to (1) identify a specific rule of customary

international law and (2) to prove that State practice and opinio juris have converged to elevate that

498. Respondent agrees entirely with Canada’s position that Article 805 guarantees investors treatment in

accordance with the MST and that, in order to establish the content of the MST, Claimant must prove
a specific rule of customary international law. Vague allusions to the MST are insufficient: Claimant
must identify and substantiate the existence (via State practice) of a “specific” rule under customary
international law, and then prove that the State violated that rule. Respondent agrees with Canada
that the decisions and awards of tribunals do not constitute instances of State practice for the purpose
of providing the existence of a customary norm. There are several points of agreement between
Claimant, Canada, and Respondent, and several points where Claimant disagrees with Canada and
Respondent. Respondent submits that the common understandings of the Contracting Parties to the

Claimant’s December 5, 2006 request for a Supreme Decree, (3) Respondent’s nearly year-long
thorough review of Claimant’s request during a lengthy application process involving multiple
governmental agencies, including the Ministry of Defense, (4) Claimant’s prompt cooperation with
all aspects of the application process, and (5) Respondent’s issuance of Supreme Decree 083 declaring
the Santa Ana Project a public necessity and authorizing Claimant to acquire the Santa Ana

concessions and to proceed with the Santa Ana Project.

500. Respondent’s detailed analysis of the Santa Ana Project and its subsequent issuance of Supreme
Decree 083 were specific assurances that gave rise to Claimant’s legitimate expectation that it would
be permitted to mine the Santa Ana concession and that, should any dispute regarding the Concession
arise, due process would be followed to resolve any such dispute, in accordance with applicable
laws.®”> In reliance on Supreme Decree 083 and Respondent’s earlier confirmations that Claimant
was proceeding in accordance with Peruvian law, Claimant “invested tens of millions of dollars in
Peru, conducted an extensive exploration program for the Santa Ana Project, developed and executed
a detailed Feasibility Study, undertook the ESIA, produced the PPC (which DGAAM approved along
with the ESIA’s Exclusive [sic] Summary), and implemented substantial community relationship
programs, which the Government confirmed to be sufficient.”°"°

501. In spite of this, on May 30, 2011, the Government suddenly, arbitrarily, and unfairly suspended
Claimant’s ESIA process, in clear violation of the applicable legal framework and against Claimant’s
legitimately held expectations.6” Less than one month later, on June 24, 2011, Prime Minister

area. On the following day, without notice or opportunity for Claimant to be heard, MINEM issued
Supreme Decree 032, revoking Supreme Decree 083 and expropriating Claimant’s investment.°*
Supreme Decree 032 provided no explanation for the Government’s decision to reverse Supreme
Decree 083. This overnight revocation stands in stark contrast to the months of detailed assessment
and vetting that Respondent required Claimant to undergo to obtain approval for the Santa Ana
Project. The revocation was also a manifest violation of Peruvian law and, as expert Mr. Flury and
the Lima First Constitutional Court confirm, evidence “a complete lack of transparency and candour
in an administrative process.” This is what Waste Management II stated would constitute a violation
of MST and demonstrate a violation of Claimant’s legitimate expectations. That the revocation was
accomplished without notice to Claimant and without providing reasons to Claimant is a serious and

self-evident due process and fair treatment violation.”

502. The governmental measures at issue in Waste Management IJ fell far below the level of egregiousness
exhibited by Respondent’s conduct in this case. Unlike in that case, Respondent did not simply fail
to respect contractual obligations or to adequately enforce a city ordinance. Here, Respondent
violated national and international law by unjustifiably, arbitrarily, and grossly unfairly revoking

Claimant’s rights to operate the concessions without affording Claimant basic due process rights,
such as notice or an opportunity to be heard, even though there was no change in circumstances.”

a full opportunity to be heard and had made use of this opportunity. By contrast, Claimant was not
informed of the Government’s intent to revoke Supreme Decree 083 and it was not given an
opportunity to be heard. In Thunderbird, the Mexican authorities’ decision was 31 pages long and
contained detailed reasoning. Here, Supreme Decree 032 only contains one sentence that
circumstances have changed, and MINEM was unable to produce any evidence that the decision was
grounded in reasoning or an assessment. Thus, comparisons with Thunderbird actually serve to

support Claimant’s position that Respondent violated the MST.°*!

503. The facts before this Tribunal are similar to those assessed by the Meralclad tribunal. Immediately

after revoking Supreme Decree 083 without notice, Respondent filed a lawsuit to attempt to formally
annul Claimant’s concessions. These facts alone would sustain a finding of a violation of the MST.
In addition, insofar as reasons were provided, Respondent’s only justification for its arbitrary act was
that circumstances had allegedly changed. In response to Claimant’s request for documents related
to the issuance of Supreme Decree 032, however, Respondent, through MINEM, responded that no
such documents existed. This inability to produce records to demonstrate an analysis of the
circumstances underlying the revocation of Supreme Decree 083 confirms the arbitrary nature of the
Government’s act, and its lack of respect for due process vis-d-vis Claimant. Respondent’s own court,
the Lima First Constitutional Court, agreed. This confirms the ex post facto nature of the justifications
that Respondent purports to advance today, namely (1) that politically motivated protests 135 km
north of Santa Ana justified the revocation of Supreme Decree 083 and (2) that Claimant allegedly
acquired its investment in Santa Ana unlawfully and in bad faith. Respondent only began advancing
its argument with respect to (2) after it had unlawfully expropriated Claimant’s investment and, as

explained, it lacks any basis in fact or law.°*

504. Respondent’s attempts to annul Claimant’s concessions by having MINEM file a civil action against

Claimant on July 5, 2011, where it is challenging the acquisition of the investment that the

Government approved of with full knowledge of all relevant facts, is another manifestation of

Respondent's violation of the MST. Similar facts led the Bilcon v. Canada tribunal to find a violation
of the MST. That tribunal held that the investor had a legitimate expectation that its Project would
be assessed on the merits in accordance with the Canadian legal standard, not “community core
values” — a factor not noted in the applicable law as a basis for denying the application to mine. The
facts of the present case are far more egregious than those in Bilcon. Unlike in Bilcon, Claimant in
this matter had no opportunity to be heard prior to the overnight revocation of its mining rights.
Respondent’s arbitrary and unlawful conduct toward Claimant lacks even a pretense of FET and

observance of basic due process rights, and constitutes a breach of Respondent’s MST obligations.***

505. Even if the Neer standard were an accurate statement of the MST, Respondent’s actions would
constitute a breach thereof. Here, the Government itself is the party that mistreated the investor’s
rights in violation of its national and international legal obligations. As explained above,
Respondent's actions following the expropriation — the 2011 MINEM Lawsuit — further demonstrate

that it was acting in bad faith.*

(ii) Respondent’s Arguments

506. Even if Claimant had identified and proven the existence of customary international law rules
protecting legitimate expectations and guaranteeing non-arbitrary treatment, Claimant has not proven

an FET violation under the MST. In the words of A/ Tamimi v. Oman, Respondent's actions were in

the integrity of its regulatory regime for natural resources.“ There was nothing unfair or inequitable
about the measures Respondent enacted — Claimant was treated fairly and equitably and in accordance

with Claimant’s legitimate expectations.

507. Claimant correctly points out that the Tribunal’s FET analysis will hinge largely on Claimant’s

686

687

legitimate expectations.°** The National Grid v. Argentina tribunal concluded that the protection of
aclaimant’s legitimate expectations was subject to two qualifications: (1) an investor should not be
shielded from ordinary business risk and (2) the investor’s expectations must have been reasonable
and legitimate in the context in which the investment was made.®? Respondent’s actions did not
violate any legitimate expectation that Claimant may have had. First, Claimant’s alleged expectation
that it “would be permitted to mine” has no reasonable foundation. Given the illegal manner with
which Claimant obtained its rights in Santa Ana, Claimant had no reasonable or legitimate basis to
expect Respondent to honor the investment indefinitely. Rather, it should have expected Respondent
to rescind its rights once it uncovered Claimant’s scheme to circumvent Respondent's constitutional
restrictions on border zone investments. Second, Claimant had no basis to assume that its special
permission to hold concession rights in Peru’s border zone was perpetual or could not be revisited
under dramatically changed circumstances. Supreme Decree 083 was premised on a “public
necessity” and Claimant should have known that, if Respondent’s national interest was threatened
under changed circumstances, the Government could revoke the Decree, as it did. Third, Claimant’s
alleged certainty that it would be “permitted to mine” ignores the ordinary business risks associated
with the mining sector. Before Respondent could even consider permitting Claimant to mine,
Claimant had to clear regulatory, legal, and social hurdles — the likes of which stall many mining

projects in this phase of development.°”

508. Claimant also argues that Respondent’s temporary suspension of the review of Claimant’s ESIA in
May 2011 violated its legitimate expectations. It did not violate any reasonable expectation, and the
legitimate expectations doctrine does not shield investors from ordinary business risks. Claimant
knew or should have known that the regulatory process for mining projects is complex and prone to
delay, especially where indigenous populations are involved. The ESIA review was suspended
temporarily in the face of paralyzing social protests against the Santa Ana Project, out of concern that
the hostile circumstances would affect the integrity of the review process. The suspension was in
Claimant’s interest because a grant of the ESIA would have started a ticking clock on the Project —
during a time when Claimant had no hope of obtaining the necessary social license from the

communities to proceed with it.°!

509. Claimant attempts to argue that the protests had nothing to do with its actual operations but were
rather general, anti-mining protests. The testimony and the documents presented at the Hearing,
however, show that Santa Ana was a central focus of the protests. The protests were genuine and
based on the legitimate concerns of the population. Simply put: the population did not trust Claimant
and was anxious about the possible impact of the Project on their lands.”

510. Respondent agrees that Claimant had a legitimate expectation that “should any dispute regarding the
Concession arise in the future, due process would be followed to resolve any such dispute in
accordance with applicable laws.” Claimant has failed to explain how this expectation was thwarted.
Both the ESIA suspension and the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 were carried out in accordance
with Peruvian law. Claimant “(i) pursued challenges against the government's actions in Peruvian
courts, (ii) has never alleged any impropriety in those proceedings; and (iii) is not pursuing a denial
of justice claim in this arbitration”, and (iv) relies on the analysis of the Peruvian courts repeatedly
in its submissions to this Tribunal. It is difficult to see how Claimant’ s expectations regarding dispute

resolution have been frustrated.”

511. Respondent’s actions were not arbitrary. Claimant appears to base its claim of arbitrariness on alleged
procedural shortcomings. Such claims under the MST face a high burden. According to Cargill, an
“arbitrary” procedure breaches the MST when it constitutes an “unexpected and shocking
repudiation of a policy's very purpose”, “grossly subvert[s] a domestic law or policy; [...] or involves
an utter lack of due process so as to offend judicial propriety.” While Respondent recognizes that
Claimant might have appreciated advanced notice and an opportunity to be heard, that preference

does not entitle Claimant to those courtesies as a matter of customary international law.%*

512. The Metalclad award did not turn on a finding of arbitrariness. Meralclad is a case about legitimate
expectations and focused on claimant’s expectations derived from Mexico’s assurance that the
investor needed no further permits to operate its landfill. Those expectations were frustrated when,
after construction was nearly complete, the local municipality denied a subsequent permit and
prevented the Project from moving forward. Metalclad did not turn on procedural inadequacies or
arbitrariness. Likewise, Bilcon v. Canada is about legitimate expectations and not about inadequate

notice or a lack of an opportunity to be heard.°*

513. Although neither Metalclad nor Bilcon is particularly relevant, it is noteworthy that each concerned
public hearings, during which it would be customary for the applicants to appear, present their project,
and engage in discussion. Here, however, there was no public forum that Claimant could have joined
to contest the issuance of Supreme Decree 032. It is unclear what specific “due process” Claimant
was denied. Claimant cannot have expected to be a participant in the discretionary, high-level
deliberations at the Council of Ministers that were aimed at debating options for quelling the protests.
Claimant has also provided no benchmark for the notice it was supposed to have received. Absent

any legal support for its due process argument, Claimant's arbitrariness claim cannot stand.°

514. The procedural facts of this case are similar to those examined in Genin v. Estonia, where respondent

revoked the Estonian Innovation Bank’s license. Like Claimant here, the Estonian Innovation Bank

received no notice of the revocation, no invitation to attend the Government session discussing the
revocation, and no chance to challenge the decision prior to the revocation’s issuance. That tribunal
disagreed that this violated the MST. Like claimant in Genin, Claimant cannot prove facts sufficient

to meet the elevated burden for demonstrating unfair or inequitable treatment under the MST.”

2. Whether Respondent Afforded Claimant Fair and Equitable Treatment Under An
Autonomous Standard

(a) The Government of Canada

515. Customary international law does not contain an obligation to protect an investor’s legitimate
expectations. Likewise, customary international law does not contain a general duty of transparency

or a prohibition against nationality-based discrimination.*

516. In addition, “/d/ecisions interpreting an autonomous fair and equitable treatment standard, in other
words, one that is not qualified by customary international law, do not create or reflect customary
international law. As the tribunal in Glamis Gold v. United States held, arbitral tribunals applying
‘autonomous standard[s] provide[ ] no guidance inasmuch as the entire method of reasoning does
not bear on an inquiry into custom.’ Such awards are therefore not relevant to ascertaining the
content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment for the purposes of Article
805 of the FTA because they apply a different standard based on the treaty practice of States that

have extended investor protection beyond what is required by customary international law.”°°

(b) Claimant’s Arguments

517. Since Respondent’s actions toward Claimant have been so outrageous, the Tribunal need not reach

the question of whether Claimant is entitled to protection under the more general and less stringent
form of FET, known as the “autonomous” FET standard. Apart from the MST that Respondent is
obliged to accord Claimant under the FTA, Respondent is obliged to accord Claimant autonomous
FET protections by operation of the MFN Clause of the FTA, contained in Article 804. Respondent
has committed to treating Canadian investors and investments in a manner no less favorable than
investors and investments from third States. In at least twenty-three other investment treaties to which
it is a party, Respondent accords investors FET available under the autonomous standard — i.e.,
without any treaty-imposed equivalence of the protection the MST. Claimant is entitled to import
those protections through the MFN Clause. Accordingly, through Article 804 of the FTA, Claimant
imports the FET standard that is provided in Art 2(2) of the Peru-United Kingdom BIT: “Jnvestments
of nationals or companies of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable

treatment.”

518. While the Parties agree that the MFN Clause may be used to import more favorable protections, the

700

701

Parties disagree as to the corpus of treaties from which Claimant may import such protections.
Contrary to Respondent’s arguments, the terms of the FTA do not prevent the application of the MFN
Clause to pre-existing treaties. Accordingly, Claimant may import such more favorable substantive

protections from pre-existing treaties, including the autonomous FET.”°!

519. The starting point of the analysis is the text of the MFN Clause. Interpreting this text in good faith in

accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context in light of their object
and purpose, as required by Article 31(1) of the VCLT, it is apparent that Article 804 permits covered
investors and investments to benefit from more favorable treatment that is afforded to investors and

investments from other States.”

The express limitation to the MFN Clause in the corresponding
Annex 804.1 clarifies only that the MFN treatment does not extend to dispute resolution mechanisms.
The clarification is silent about MFN treatment not encompassing substantive standards of treatment,

such as the FET standard. As such, no limit is imposed.”°°

520. Respondent’s argument that it “reserved the right to accord investors from Canada ‘differential

treatment”, such that the MEN Clause cannot be used to import more favorable treatment standards
from pre-existing treaties hinges on Respondent’s “Peru's First Reservation.” Respondent, however,
misrepresents this reservation’s reach and its role in the FTA. The reservation to the MFN Clause in
Article 808 concern only existing and future non-conforming measures that either Canada or Peru
may have, may maintain, or may adopt. The text of Article 808 does not contain a reservation or
other limitation to the MFN Clause as it concerns important more favorable standards of treatment.
As Respondent understands, the terms “measure” and “treatment” are conceptually distinct. In the
Canada-Peru BIT, Respondent’s reservations under the MFN Clause therein contained clearly
referred to the standards of treatment contained in pre-existing international agreements. This
demonstrates that the two Contracting States knew how to use clear and unequivocal language to limit
the scope of the MFN Clause as it applies to more favorable “treatment”, as opposed to “measures.”
The deliberate absence of such language in the FTA confirms that no such limitation exists.
Accordingly, there is nothing in the FTA that prevents Claimant from relying on the MFN Clause to
avail itself of more favorable standards of treatment afforded to other investors and investments in

pre-existing treaties.”

521. Because the MFN Clause extends to standards of treatment, Claimant may use the MFN Clause to
import the autonomous FET that is not linked to the MST. The autonomous FET requires that
Respondent (1) protect Claimant’s legitimate expectations, (2) treat Claimant’s investment
transparently, (3) guarantee Claimant procedural propriety and due process, and (4) not deny justice
to Claimant or its investment. The autonomous FET standard also protects Claimant from State
conduct that (1) falls short of good faith, (2) breaches the State’s contractual obligations, (3) is

disproportionate, (4) constitutes coercion or harassment, or (5) violates the State’s obligation to “do

522. The FET standard encompasses the legitimate expectations of investors regarding the key terms of
their investment and the stability of the host State’s legal and business framework. The case Tecmed
v. Mexico is considered to be the seminal decision on FET and Saluka v. Czech Republic found that
legitimate expectations forms the dominant element of FET. Investment case law identifies several
situations where host State conduct gives rise to an investor’s legitimate expectations. An example
of where tribunals agree that an expectation is “/egitimate” where the host State has assumed a
specific legal obligation for the future. The Swez v. Argentina tribunal emphasized the importance of
the investor’s reliance on the stability of the host State’s business or legal environment as an element
to legitimate expectations. Once legitimate expectations are found to exist, host State conduct to the
contrary constitutes a breach of the FET. Bad faith on the part of the host State, however, is not
required. Recently, the Gold Reserve v. Venezuela tribunal held that changes in a government’s
mining sector policy did not excuse conduct in violation of the FET — rather, politically-driven policy
changes violate the FET. Thus, it cannot be disputed that State conduct violates the FET if it

eviscerates the arrangements in reliance upon which the foreign investor was induced to invest.”

523. The FET also requires Respondent to treat investments transparently — i.e., without administrative

ambiguity or opacity. Transparency is often linked to the investor’s legitimate expectations, and it

also means that the legal framework for the investor’s operations must be readily apparent.”°*

524. The FET also requires Respondent to act in good faith. The principle of good faith is recognized as

a general principle of law under Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.
Numerous tribunals have confirmed that it is a fundamental aspect of the FET standard. Bad faith,

however, is not required for a finding of a breach of the FET standard.”

standard to be successful, a claimant must prove that the act(s) performed by a State organ in relation

526. Claimant states that Respondent breached the FET standard (and, so far as they overlap, the MST)

  

by:

. Arbitrarily and unwarrantedly suspending Claimant’s ESIA process at Santa Ana
on May 30, 2011;

. Failing to provide Claimant an opportunity to appeal the Government’s decision
to suspend Bear Creek’s ESIA process;

. Non-transparently revoking Supreme Decree 083 overnight through its issuance of
Supreme Decree 032, without giving Bear Creek notice or an opportunity to be
heard;

. Unjustifiably expropriating Bear Creek's investment through the issuance of
Supreme Decree 032;

. Failing to provide Claimant notice or an opportunity to be heard prior to the
Government's expropriation of Bear Creek’s investment through Supreme Decree
032;

. Failing to provide Claimant an opportunity to appeal the Government’s decision
to expropriate Bear Creek's investment;

. Failing to provide any meaningful reasoning underlying its unilateral and

unexpected revocation of Supreme Decree 083, which came after Claimant had
already spent three-and-a-half years developing and investing millions of US
dollars in the Santa Ana Project in reliance on Supreme Decree 083 and the
Government's representations and encouragements

. Frustrating Claimant's legitimate expectation that it would own and operate the
Santa Ana Project;

. Expropriating Claimant’s investment without paying Claimant any compensation;
and
. Unjustifiably attempting to annul Bear Creek’s concessions by having MINEM file

a civil action against Bear Creek.”

527. In addition, Respondent’s actions toward Claimant have violated Respondent’s obligation under the
autonomous FET standard to act in good faith and to do no harm. “Good faith” is understood as the
Government’s obligation to “act in a consistent manner free from ambiguity and totally
transparently.” As explained, Respondent's arbitrary expropriation of Claimant’s investment without
due process and in full knowledge that it was acting unlawfully breaches this standard. Similarly,
Respondent’s attempt to avoid answering for its unlawful actions by baselessly accusing Claimant of
acquiring its investments in an irregular manner and attempting to annul the concessions through
MINEM’s civil action amount to bad faith. Claimant faced a similar situation to that in the Bayindir
case — the supposed justifications that Respondent has offered for its unlawful conduct only mask the
true motivation — the Government's political interest in expropriating Claimant’s investment. Such

bad faith is a clear violation of the FET.”

528. Respondent also breached the requirement under the autonomous FET to “do no harm”, defined in
Vivendi II. It is indisputable that Respondent attempted to “disparage and undercut a concession”
by issuing Supreme Decree 032 under the conditions listed in Vivendi I[.7'* Thus, through its
deliberate acts and omissions, Respondent manifestly failed to treat Claimant fairly and equitably,

resulting in the evisceration of Claimant’s investment.’!4

(c) Respondent’s Arguments

529. Claimant cannot import an autonomous FET standard because (i) the FTA excludes pre-existing
treaties from the scope of its MFN Clause and (ii) importing an autonomous FET standard would
conflict with the express will of the Contracting Parties. Claimant’s shift in its emphasis and
arguments demonstrates that it recognizes that the MST, and not an autonomous FET, applies to this

dispute.7'5

530. Autonomous FET standards only appear in treaties that Respondent signed prior to the FTA, and
Respondent exempted pre-existing treaty obligations from the scope of FTA’s MFN Clause. Through
its reservation, Respondent excludes “measure/s] that accord[] differential treatment” under (2) “any
bilateral or multilateral international agreement in force or signed prior to the date of entry into
force of [the FTA].” The FTA defines “measures” as “any law, regulation, procedure, requirement
or practice.” Through its reservation, Respondent reserved the right to accord investors from Canada
“differential treatment” as compared to investors from other countries who are subject to pre-existing
treaties. Claimant’s semantic argument regarding the use of the term “treatment” has highlighted a
distinction without a difference. Any treatment that Respondent might provide is necessarily directly
tied to a “measure” — i.e., a “law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice” that accords
treatment. Respondent specifically carved out this type of “measure that accords treatment” from
the FTA’s MEN Clause. Accordingly, Respondent’s reservation excludes the requirement to provide
or the practice of providing an autonomous standard of FET under a pre-existing BIT. Claimant
cannot leverage the MFN Clause to import an autonomous FET standard from a treaty that pre-dates

the 2009 FTA.7'®

531. Importing an autonomous FET standard would conflict with the will of the Contracting Parties. When
the Parties negotiated the FTA, they specifically and purposefully agreed in Article 805 to limit their
FET obligations to the MST, and this choice was consistent with a broader change in Respondent’s
treaty practice that began after 2000. If successful, Claimant’s argument would render meaningless

aclear and deliberate shift in Respondent’s treaty practice. Claimant has not attempted to challenge

the fact that the Contracting Parties intended, as stated in Article 805, to guarantee FET only up to
the MST under international law. This Tribunal must enforce the will of the Contracting Parties and

reject Claimant’s attempt to import a more favorable standard.”!”

532. Claimant’s position is at odds with statements the Canadian Government issued during its FTA

I

720

negotiations with Respondent. Canada was clear that the investment chapter in the FTA would be
consistent with the BIT. Respondent understands that both the BIT and the FTA exclude the
importation of more favorable standards from pre-existing treaties, even though each provision uses
different language. The two texts are consistent with one another — it would be highly unlikely that
the treaty parties would fundamentally reverse their positions in the 11 months in between signing
the BIT and the later FTA. Furthermore, it would also be inconsistent with the practice of most other
States at the time that previous agreements would not be excluded, in that BIT and FTA parties

® Canada also shares

typically work to tighten limitations on MFN Clauses, not loosen them.”
Respondent’s understanding that an MFN Clause cannot alter a treaty’s explicit FET standard. This
is clear from Canada’s interpretation of its FET obligations under NAFTA. By invoking the MST,
Canada and its NAFTA Co-signatories clarified that the FET standard in NAFTA is equivalent to the
FET standard in the FTA.7! Later, Ms. Kinnear, then of the Canadian Government’s Trade Law
Division, confirmed that a claimant cannot invoke NAFTA’s MEN Clause to circumvent the parties’
express limitation of their FET obligations to the MST. Canada made its position clear: once
contracting parties define the scope of a treaty’s FET protection, a claimant cannot expand those
protections by invoking an MFN Clause. This Tribunal must give effect to this interpretation and

reject Claimant’s attempt to import an autonomous FET standard.”

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

533. The Tribunal has found above that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an unlawful indirect
expropriation. Therefore, there is no need to examine whether it also constituted a breach of a duty
to afford Claimant fair and equitable treatment. The Parties have not presented arguments related to
the legal consequences of such a finding, and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those

that follow from an unlawful indirect expropriation.

C. | WHETHER RESPONDENT AFFORDED CLAIMANT FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY (“FPS”)

534. The sections of the FTA that are referenced by the Parties are reproduced here for reference and

convenience and without prejudice to their meaning or applicability:

Article 804°: Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment

1. Each Party shall accord to investors of the other Party treatment no less favourable
than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of a non-Party with respect
to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and
sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.

2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than
that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments of investors of a non-Party
with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct,
operation and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.

 

3. For greater certainty, the treatment accorded by a Party under this Article means,
with respect to a sub-national government, treatment accorded, in like
cir by that sub-national government to investors, and to ii of

 

 

investors, of a non-Party.

[Footnote 2: Article 804 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 804.1]

Article 805: Minimum Standard of Treatment

1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including
fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.

2. The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security”
in paragraph I do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is
required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of
aliens.

3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this
Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there
has been a breach of this Article.

1. Claimant’s Arguments

535. The MEN Clause contained in Article 804 of the FTA permits Claimant to benefit from other

substantive standards of treatment that Respondent offers investors under other international treaties
to which it is a party. Respondent has entered into at least seven BITs where it promises to afford
covered investors and investments full protection and security (“FPS”) — the standalone standard of
treatment that is not linked to the customary international law MST. Through Article 804 of the FTA,

Claimant is entitled to the FPS standard provided in Article 2(2) of the Peru-United Kingdom BIT:

 

wy, of nati or companies in each Contracting Party [...] shall enjoy full protection and

security in the territory of the other Contracting Party.””

536. FPS requires Respondent to take every reasonable measure necessary to protect and ensure the legal

m0

™m

and physical security of the investments made by a protected investor in its territory. FPS protects
investors and their investments from physical threats, as well as from unjustified administrative and
legal action taken by a government that injure the legal rights of the investor or investment. The
Siemens v. Argentina tribunal defined legal security as “the quality of the legal system which implies
certainty in its norms and, consequently, their foreseeable application.” While the FPS imposes an
obligation of vigilance and due diligence upon the government, there is no requirement to show

malice or negligence to establish a breach of the FPS.”*

537. By declaring the Santa Ana Project a public necessity and enacting Supreme Decree 083, Respondent
agreed to provide Claimant’s investment the legal security with which a Peruvian Supreme Decree is
imbued. As Prof. Bullard explains, allowing the Government to change its decision on a public
necessity declaration on reasons of mere political convenience would contravene the principle of legal
security. Respondent breached the FPS when it expropriated Claimant’s investment by enacting

Supreme Decree 032.7

538. While Respondent has the power to revoke a previously issued Supreme Decree, it must do so in
accordance with Peruvian law. As Prof. Bullard explains, such a limitation to property rights must
respect the grounds set forth in Article 203.2 of Law 27444 and must not be in response to the
authorities’ reasons of opportunity, merit, or convenience. As Prof. Bullard and the Lima First
Constitutional Court have confirmed, there is no reasonable motive for Supreme Decree 032:
Claimant’s rights have been violated by this “clearly arbitrary act; all the more so, because upon its
issuance, the Claimant was not provided with the opportunity to accredit that the circumstances

relating to its assumed obligations had not been neglected.”"*

Even assuming for the sake of
argument that Respondent had a valid reason to revoke Supreme Decree 083, this arbitrary revocation
through unlawful processes is not a “reasonable measure of prevention [that] a well-administered
government could be expected to exercise under similar circumstances”, as required by the FPS
standard.”° Respondent’s attempt to annul Claimant’s concessions through MINEM’s 2011 civil

action is another illustration of its violation of the FPS standard.’

539. Claimant’s FPS claim is baseless because (i) Claimant cannot use the FTA’s MEN Clause to import

a more favorable, autonomous FPS standard and (ii) the FTA’s FPS provision does not guarantee

legal security.”””

540. For the same reasons as provided in Respondent’s arguments concerning the FET, Claimant cannot

import an autonomous FPS standard because the FTA excludes pre-existing obligations from the
scope of its MFN Clause. Each of the agreements referenced by Claimant was signed and entered
into force before the FTA went into force on August 1, 2009. The 10 investment agreements that
Respondent signed after the FTA entered into force do not help Claimant because each agreement,

like Article 805 of the FTA, limits FPS to the MST.”*

541. To assert a breach of the MST for FPS, Claimant must identify and substantiate a rule of customary

m1

international law that Respondent allegedly violated, demonstrating (i) a concordant practice of a
number of States acquiesced in by others and (ii) a conception that the practice is required by or
consistent with prevailing law (opinio juris). Claimant has failed to make such a showing and has

not cited a single case analyzing the FPS under the MST. As Claimant has failed to meet its burden,

its claim fails.””°

542. It is by no means clear that an autonomous FPS standard would embrace Claimant’s claims of “/egal
security” against government changes in the application of the law, even if Claimant could import
one. Although some tribunals have considered such an expansion of the FPS, many — including Gold
Reserve and Suez v. Argentina — have rejected such innovation, finding instead that the FPS relates
to physical harm. Claimant has not alleged that Respondent failed to protect the physical integrity of

its Peruvian assets and, accordingly, the FPS claim must fail.”°

543. Even if the Tribunal were to take the novel step of finding a customary international law rule
guaranteeing legal security, it would not find a FPS violation, as Claimant has not been deprived of
legal security. Supreme Decree 032 was a reflection of the same broad discretionary authority under
which Supreme Decree 083 was issued, and Claimant had no claim to “security” under Peruvian law
that a discretionary determination could never be revisited. What’s more, Claimant acquired its
alleged rights to the Santa Ana concessions illegally. Respondent does not have any obligation to

provide legal security to unlawful investments.”*!

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

544. The Tribunal has found above that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an unlawful indirect
expropriation. Therefore, there is no need to examine whether it also constituted a breach of a duty
to afford Claimant full protection and security. The Parties have not presented arguments related to
the legal consequences of such finding, and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those

that follow from an unlawful indirect expropriation.

[Footnote 2: Article 804 shall be interpreted in accordance with Annex 804.1]
1. Claimant’s Arguments

546. Respondent is party to at least fourteen international agreements where it promises covered investors
and investments protection against UDM. By means of the MEN Clause contained in Article 804 of
the FTA, Claimant is entitled to the protection against UDM that is provided at Article 2(2) of the
Peru-United Kingdom BIT: “Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in
its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.” Respondent has breached this

substantive protection.”

547. Protection against UDM is generally understood to mean that the State must afford protection against
any measure that, in the words of the oft cited EDF v. Romania award “inflicts damage on the investor
without serving any apparent legitimate purpose; a measure that is not based on legal standards but

Violation of any one of these facets of protection against UDM would suffice
to show that Respondent violated the FTA. Respondent violated all of them.™ With regard to
unreasonable measures, the AES v. Hungary tribunal explained that the measure must be reasonable,
having a correlation between the State’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve
it. In respect of discriminatory measures, the Ulysseas v. Ecuador tribunal noted that two similar

situations would be treated differently — discriminatory intent is not required.7*>

of Claimant’s investment, through illegitimate processes and without notice, the opportunity to be
heard, or an appeal, inflicted damage on Claimant that served no legitimate purpose.”° Prof. Bullard
found that this action was “grounded on reasons of opportunity, merit or convenience”, and the Lima
First Constitutional Court held that insofar as Supreme Decree 032 pertained to Claimant’s
investment, it was arbitrary and in violation of Peruvian Law.”*” Not only did these actions inflict
damage without an apparent legitimate purpose but, by extension, Respondent’s actions in violation
of Peruvian law are “not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal
preferences” and were “taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision

The alleged “circumstances implying that the legally required conditions for the enactment of

Supreme Decree 083 no longer exist” have never been explained to Claimant.”

549. It is indisputable that Respondent’s expropriation of Claimant’s investment without notice or the

opportunity to be heard was in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure. Accordingly,
this Tribunal should find that Respondent breached its obligations under the FTA to afford Claimant

and its investment protection against arbitrary and discriminatory measures.”“°

550. In addition, Supreme Decree 032 was unreasonable because it, rather than serve a legitimate public

purpose, “had the effect of depriving local communities and Peru as a whole of much-needed revenue
and opportunities”, and “was decided for the purpose of appropriating at no cost a world-class

mining project.”™'

551. The enactment of Supreme Decree 032 and MINEM’s 2011 initiation of its civil action impaired the

management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of Claimant’s investment in Peru and were
discriminatory. Claimant’s arrangement with Ms. Villavicencio to acquire the concessions via Option
Agreements is a common arrangement in Peru’s mining sector, used to avoid interference by others
while obtaining the authorization to acquire title as mandated by Article 71 of the Constitution.
Respondent has not targeted any other investor that acquired mining rights in frontier areas in a

comparable way. Claimant has been the sole focus of Respondent’s breaches of international law.”

2. Respondent’s Arguments

552. The FTA does not contain a stand-alone UDM clause, and Claimant cannot manufacture such

protection by invoking the MFN Clause. First, the MFN Clause does not apply to protections in
treaties signed before the FTA entered into force on August 1, 2009. Each of the treaties Claimant

that Respondent entered into after the FTA went into force includes a UDM provision.” Claimant

has not refuted these points and, accordingly, its UDM claim must fail.”

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

553. The Tribunal has found above that Supreme Decree 032 constituted an unlawful indirect
expropriation. Therefore, there is no need to examine whether it also constituted a breach of a duty to
afford Claimant protection against unreasonable or discriminatory measures. The Parties have not
presented arguments related to the legal consequences of such finding, and such a finding indeed

would not change or add to those that follow from an unlawful indirect expropriation.

E. ARGUMENTS RELATED TO CONTRIBUTORY FAULT AND LIABILITY

554. The following arguments were made in response to the Tribunal’s questions during the Hearing and

to the following question contained in PO-10:

(e) (iv) if the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had contributed to the social unrest
that occurred in the spring of 2011 — by act or omission - how should such a
contribution be taken into account in determining matters of liability and/or
quantum?”

1. Claimant’s Arguments

555. The theory of contributory fault cannot excuse or reduce Respondent’s liability for its breach of the
FTA, as Claimant did not cause the social unrest in Southern Puno. Nonetheless, if the Tribunal were
to find that Claimant had contributed to the social unrest, the doctrine of contributory fault under

international law requires that the party advocating for its application demonstrate — in addition to

contribution to the investor’s harm — that the investor’s willful or negligent conduct or omission
materially and significantly contributed to its harm, directly causing it. There must also be a sufficient
causal link between the negligent or willful act or omission and the harm, in accordance with ILC

Article 31. Respondent cannot meet its burden of proof for such a finding.”

556. Here, Claimant carried out over 130 community outreach workshops and implemented social
programs to benefit the local communities. The record demonstrates that Claimant was responsive
to concerns that were raised and took reasonable steps to address them.”* Claimant worked with
outside consultants who were leaders in implementing mining projects in Peru and benefitted from
their expertise.“ As the Project progressed, Claimant conducted responsible community outreach,

which MINEM endorsed through its approval of Claimant’s CPP.”*”

557. Incontrast to Claimant’s activities, Respondent’s DGAAM - the agency responsible for determining
the most suitable CPP — refused to participate in field and service trips prior to Claimant’s submission
of the ESIA and instead delegated the matter to regional authorities. Testimony also confirmed that

the DGAAM never informed Claimant of any shortcomings in the CPP.”°!

558. Respondent has not established that Claimant’s community relations program materially and

significantly contributed to the social unrest, such that, “but for” Claimant’s alleged negligent acts or
omissions, the unrest would never have occurred and Respondent would not have issued Supreme
Decree 032. Even Respondent’s Constitutional Court found that Claimant was not at fault for the
social unrest in Southern Puno.” Given that protestors demanded cancellation of all concessions of
all holders, Respondent cannot establish that “but for” Claimant’s outreach program, there would

never have been social unrest in the area.”

Given the totality of the circumstances, Respondent let
events get out of control and did not try to mediate, failing in its responsibilities under Supreme
Decree 028 and its implementing Ministerial Resolution No. 304.’ In particular, Respondent failed
in its Supreme Decree 028 obligations to “guide, direct, and conduct citizen-participation processes,
promote or conduct, together with the owner of the Mining Rights, activities to inform the populations
involved.”"*> That did not happen — the State abandoned the investor, with the consequences we have

seen.7*°

559. Even if the Tribunal finds that, nonetheless, Claimant acted in a manner that materially and

significantly contributed to and directly caused the social unrest and the expropriation of Claimant’ s

investment, such a finding would have no effect on liability — only on quantum.”*”

aggressive and deceitful actions of those who opposed the investment, and not be claimant's allegedly insufficient

social outreach program had happened opportunely, the events that led to the expropriation would not have

2. Respondent’s Arguments

758

561. Claimant’s failure to make a full and candid representation in the application of December 2006

would impact liability. The revocation of the Supreme Decree 083 on June 23-24, 2011 was based
on (1) the protest that made it impossible to maintain that Decree and (2) the misrepresentations that
were announced publicly in the meeting between the Aymaras, MINEM, and other members of the
Government. Supreme Decree 032 was not adopted on a whim — it was a consequence of Claimant’s
misrepresentations.”” There can be no liability because the withdrawal was not arbitrary — rather, it

was the only reasonable thing that the Government could do in the circumstances.” There are also

 

serious consequences for Claimant’s misrepresentations to the communities.”! Claimant’s witness,
Mr. Swarthout, confirmed in oral testimony that there was confusion as to who would be responsible

for providing what to the affected populations.”

562. Claimant’s contribution is relevant in respect to its legitimate expectations: Article 71 is an exception

and a foreign investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that the exception will be maintained if
the investor does not act in accordance with either the Constitution or in compliance with the terms
of the Public Necessity Decree. If the investor does not obtain the social license or comply with its
other obligations, it cannot have the legitimate expectation that the rights granted under Article 71 of

the Constitution will remain.”

Parties disagree as to the role that Peruvian authorities had to play. Respondent believes that its role

obtain the trust and confidence of the communities. Approval of a CPP, however, is not approval of

how it was implemented. Implementation is in the company’s sphere of responsibilities. Local

authorities were heavily involved in assisting Claimant. While there must be cooperation between
the authorities, the issue is not whether the population trusts the Government: the issue is whether
the population trusts the particular investor and the particular project. The company must explain its
Project to the communities and earn their trust.”

564. The cases cited by Claimant show that the Tribunal should consider any contributory fault — not

merely “but for” causation — and should reduce damages accordingly.”

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

565. The Parties disagree regarding their respective roles and obligations in the outreach to the local
communities and the application of Supreme Decree 028.7

566. Respondent concedes that “/its/ role was to approve mechanisms and processes or to approve the
path through which the Company [could] obtain the trust and confidence of the communities.” But
Respondent qualifies that role, explaining that approval of a CPP is not approval of how it was
implemented. Implementation is in the company’s sphere of responsibilities. Local authorities were

heavily involved in assisting Claimant.”

567. It is recalled that, when the Tribunal examined the outreach activities of Claimant in more detail, the

conclusion above was:

Regarding the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio: in a “careful consideration by the
government authorities” over a period of almost one year, the above mentioned available
information regarding Ms. Villavicencio’s involvement could not be neglected by the
government agencies involved in the process and at the very least should have been noted.

The alleged oversight, if it existed, must be attributed to Respondent and not to Claimant.
Therefore, the Tribunal does not see any reason why the process as conducted would make
the Application or the resulting Supreme Decree 083 unconstitutional.
And regarding Claimant’s outreach activities: “The evidence summarized above shows
clearly that from the very beginning until the time before the meeting of June 23, 2011 all
outreach activities by Claimant were known to Respondent's authorities and were
conducted with their approval, support, and endorsement, and that no objections were
raised by the authorities in this context. While, as mentioned above, further actions by
Claimant would have been feasible, on the basis of the continued coordination with and
support by Respondent's authorities, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant could take it for
granted to have complied with all legal requirements with regard to its outreach to the local
ities and that Ri de after its i ipp) and support with

Claimant's conduct, cannot in hindsight claim that this conduct was contrary to the ILO
Convention 169 or was insufficient, and caused or contributed to the social unrest in the
region.”
568. As correctly pointed out by Claimant’, Respondent has the burden of proof that its breaches of the
FTA, which the Tribunal found in its considerations above in this Award, were to some extent caused
by Claimant. In view of the above cited conclusions of the Tribunal, Respondent has not met that

burden.

569. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that there was no contributory fault and liability of Claimant.

570. The Tribunal’s question in section 2.1.4 (e) of PO-10 was as follows:

What are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if it were to
conclude that:

i. the Claimant's alleged investment was lawfully expropriated?
ii. the Claimant's alleged investment was unlawfully expropriated?

iii. Respondent breached its obligations under the FTA for FET or other
obligations under other provisions of the FTA?

iv. if the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had contributed to the social
unrest that occurred in the spring of 2011 — by act or omission - how should
such a contribution be taken into account in determining matters of

571. The relevant sections of the FTA provide as follows:

Article 812°: Expropriation

1. Neither Party may nationalize or expropriate a covered investment either directly,
or indirectly through measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”), except for a public
purpose, in accordance with due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner
and on prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

2. Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated
investment immediately before the expropriation took place (‘date of
expropriation”), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the
intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include
going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property,
and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.

3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully realizable and freely
transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency and
shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the
date of expropriation until date of payment.

AMOUNTS INVESTED / ANSWERS TO TRIBUNAL’S QUESTIONS (E)(1) — (IV)

1. Claimant’s Arguments

572. Claimant requests that the Tribunal award Claimant at least US$ 296.6 million if it finds that Santa
Ana was lawfully expropriated. If the Tribunal finds another Treaty breach or an unlawful

expropriation, the Tribunal should award at least US$ 522.2 million.”

573. Claimant is entitled to the monetary equivalent of the investments unlawfully taken by Respondent.’

To determine the compensation that Respondent owes to Claimant, the Tribunal should first look to
any /ex specialis in the FTA and, in the absence of lex specialis, to the rules of customary international

law. For a lawful expropriation, the /ex specialis is contained in Article 812 of the FTA. For an

unlawful expropriation or any other breach, the FTA is silent and customary international law fills

the lacuna.”

574. Claimant’s argument with respect to the application of the customary international law standard

contained in the Chorzow Factory case is best taken from its own words:

Peru must be ordered to pay the full reparation, that is, in the words of the Chorzow Factory
case, a sum which would “wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish
the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed.” Article 31 of the ILC Articles explains that this covers “any damage, whether
material or moral” caused by the unlawful expropriation. This would include not only
damage caused to Bear Creek concerning the Santa Ana Project itself, but also damages
for losses sustained with respect to the Corani Project, which resulted from Peru’s
expropriation of the Santa Ana Project and other FTA violations. Article 36 of the ILC
Articles, in turn, provides that these damages must “cover any financially assessable
damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established.”””*

575. Pursuant to Chorzow Factory, tribunals are required to award the higher of the value on the date of
the expropriation plus interest, or the value on the date of the award. This accords with the principle

of law that a wrongdoer should not benefit from the wrongdoing. To award otherwise would

nonsensibly reward unlawful conduct.”

576. Furthermore, it is consistent with the principle stated in Chorzow that the compensation due to a

claimant in respect of the unlawful taking should not be limited to “the value of the undertaking at
the moment of dispossession plus interest, since such a limitation could place the claimant in a
position more favorable than if the State had complied with its legal obligations.’"° For unlawful
expropriations, the focus is on the subjective “financial situation the injured person would be in if the
unlawful act had not been committed.” For lawful expropriations — unlike here — the focus is on the
objective “value of the property concerned.” The compensation difference for lawful versus unlawful

expropriations is intuitive and generally accepted.”””

577. Since Respondent has committed an unlawful expropriation, the standard of compensation is full

compensation, aiming to restore Claimant to the financial position it would have occupied but for
Respondent’s unlawful expropriation.””> The evidence shows that Claimant would have been able to
continue operations and move into production, even with the potential delays caused by protests.””
Also, and relation to the Tribunal’s question (d) “Of the two reasons relied upon by Respondent for
Decree 032, could that Decree also have been legally issued, if only one of the two reasons could be
established: (i) only the alleged illegality of the Claimant's Application? ”, Claimant argued that, with
respect to its non-expropriation claims, the evidence shows that (1) Claimant did not violate Peruvian
law and (2) even if it had, Respondent would have excused the violation, had Claimant been given
the opportunity to address the accusation.” The State is not permitted to violate international law

with impunity simply because it ends up being correct about the reasons underlying a violation: a

578. Even if the expropriation of Claimant’s assets had been lawful, Claimant would nonetheless be

entitled to prompt, adequate, and effective compensation, in accordance with Article 812 of the FTA.
Article 812 of the FTA elaborates the standards of “just and effective” and “prompt, adequate and
effective”, but fails to define the term “fair market value” (“FMV”).”? The customary international
legal standard for compensation for expropriation is “ful”? compensation. In CME, the tribunal
observed that the aim of such provisions in BITs is to assure “that when a State takes foreign property,
full compensation must be paid.””* This interpretation is supported by other tribunals, which

observed that “fu/l” compensation refers to “prompt, adequate and effective” compensation. ”**

Claimant’s expert defines FMV as “the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which
property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical

willing and able seller, acting at arms-length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is

under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.”"*>

This definition is non-controversial between the Parties”® and Respondent “does not dispute that fair

9787

market value is the appropriate standard in this case. The cases submitted by both Parties

establish that (1) awarding amounts invested is not an appropriate measure of FMV and (2) the DCF

method provides a reliable estimate of FMV, especially given that this is a mineral property/project.”**

579. The FTA makes no exception for investments that the State believes would have ultimately been

unsuccessful.” Even if it could be said that there was a “lack of social license” (which Claimant
disputes), there is always a possibility that local opposition may impact a project. This possibility is
accounted for in the FMV. A hypothetical purchaser of the Santa Ana Project would have obtained
the social license had it been provided an opportunity to invest the time and money to do so.

Respondent’s conduct, however, prevented the natural progression of the Santa Ana Project.”

580. In the unlikely event that this Tribunal finds that Respondent did not expropriate Claimant’s

investment, the Tribunal must still award compensation to Claimant because Respondent violated one

or more of the other substantive protections of the FTA. Such actions are akin to unlawful

expropriation and ought to be compensated on the same basis of the same principles.”! The Vivendi

JI tribunal observed that this is a generally accepted basis for compensation.”*

The quantification of
full compensation for non-expropriatory violations will vary from case to case.”* There is, however,
an emerging trend toward basing such damages on the FMV standard, plus historical or discrete
losses, when applicable. Notably, the Gold Reserve v. Venezuela tribunal held that compensation

due should reflect the seriousness of the violation.”>

581. Since “/1] the practices employed to assess mineral resources and reserves are well-established; [2]

the time and costs required to develop and process the minerals can be estimated with a reasonable
degree of precision; [3] detailed capital estimates on Santa Ana had been conducted; and [4] well-
developed international markets exist for the processed or semi-processed metal products that will
absorb a project’s entire production immediately”, mining and other extractive projects are different
from non-extractive business and can be valued using a DCF methodology, even pre-production.””°
Investment tribunals, including Gold Reserve, Quiborax, Al-Bahloul, and Vivendi II have
acknowledged that the DCF method can be a reliable estimate of FMV even in the absence of a fully-
operational business.”” If a purchaser would have used DCF to value Santa Ana on the expropriation
date — regardless of its stage of development or history of profitability — then no basis exists under

the FTA for the Tribunal not to use such a valuation here.’ CIMVAL, the internationally-accepted

valuation standards specific to the valuation of mineral properties, expressly endorsed income-based
valuation approaches (like DCF) for assets classified as “Development Properties”, which is the case

of Santa Ana.””

582. Respondent ignores investment treaty cases where tribunals have endorsed DCF for early-stage
projects. In Vivendi v. Argentina, although the tribunal rejected claimant’s DCF model, it nonetheless
explained how such a model could be accepted in circumstances like Claimant’s.*” That tribunal
stated that “a claimant might be able to establish clearly that an investment, such as a concession,
would have been profitable by presenting sufficient evidence of its expertise and proven record of
profitability of concessions it (or indeed others) had operated in similar circumstances.” That
tribunal noted that an absence of a history of profitability does not absolutely preclude the use of DCF
methodology. To overcome a lack of history of profitability, a claimant would need to produce
convincing evidence of its ability to produce profits in the particular circumstances it faced. Such
evidence could include experience (of its own or of experts) or corporate records that establish on the
balance of probabilities it would have produced profits from the concession in the face of the risks

involved.*°!

583. According to PwC, the mining sector is one where tribunals can and should be willing to accept DCF
for new ventures because the mining sector is one that is considered less speculative or uncertain
than, for example, a new tech start-up with an unproven business model. In Gold Reserve v.
Venezuela, the tribunal applied a DCF valuation, awarding US$ 713 million for two mining
concessions that had never entered production at the time of their wrongful revocation. There,
Venezuela accepted that DCF is an appropriate and valid tool to measure the FMV.*” Both experts

submitted valuations using the DCF method, even though the expropriation occurred prior to the

Project’s construction and entry into production.*°*

Here, the experts have also agreed that DCF is
appropriate.** Like the tribunal in Gold Reserve, this Tribunal has sufficient data to prefer the DCF
model over any other method, enabling the Tribunal to determine Claimant’s hypothetical cash flows,
but for Respondent’s unlawful action.*°> At the Hearing, Claimant was unaware of any further case
where the DCF methodology has been used for another project that reached a level of development

similar to the Santa Ana Project.*°°

a DCF or Market Approach would be more appropriate in some circumstances.*” As in Siag, the
value of the investment greatly exceeds the sums actually expended by Claimants. There, like here,
claimants submitted a DCF model and a Comparable Transactions Model. Although that tribunal
rejected the DCF approach, the value awarded was nonetheless consistent with the DCF Approach.
In Al-Bahoul, although the tribunal did not use the DCF method, the tribunal did say that it might be
appropriate when the investment had not started operation but sufficient data allowing for future cash-
flow projections was available. This case has such projections.** SPP v. Egypt and Gemplus v.
Mexico rejected the cost-based approach.*” In Gemplus v. Mexico, the tribunal rejected non-DCF
methods because they failed to take account of the most valuable asset: future income streams that
were reasonably anticipated, and these were not reflected in the share price. While the Gemplus

tribunal rejected a pure DCF approach, it applied a modified form of the income-based approach.*!°

In SPP v. Egypt, the tribunal noted that it was “incontestable” that Claimant’s investment had a value

that exceeded its out-of-pocket costs.*"!

585. Claimant is not claiming for its roughly US$ 2 - 3 million expenditures prior to the issuance of

Supreme Decree 083. Nonetheless, these activities were not unlawful, as prospection activity does

not require permits.*!?

586. Awarding Claimant only its sunk investment is manifestly inappropriate and inadequate. As the

Parties experts agreed, an award of amounts invested is distinct from FMV - the Tribunal cannot
award FMV as required by the FTA through an award of the cost of investment.*'? According to the
CIMVAL standards, which require either the Income or Market Approach,*" a cost-based approach
is not appropriate for Development Properties like Santa Ana, nor is it consistent with the valuation
principles set forth in Chorzow Factory. Such an award would incorrectly imply that the investment
was made risk-free and with no expected return. The analysis shows that Respondent’s cost-based
approach would award Claimant less than 25% of Santa Ana’s value, allowing Respondent to unjustly
capture the increase in value of the Santa Ana Project that Claimant created.*'* The cost-based

methodology should be rejected in favor of FTI’s DCF.*!°

Respondent's statement that Claimant’s analysts are not independent, Claimant highlighted that there
is an ethical wall inside investment banks that separates analysts from the investment banking side of
the entity. Respondent’s experts relied on the analysts’ reports in their own reports. Canada is a well

As confirmed in Gold Reserve, analysts’ reports are “useful references to ensure that the
compensation awarded is reasonable.”*'? Each analyst presented a Net Asset Value for Santa Ana
as of the date of the Report.*° There are seven independent, contemporaneous, third-party non-
litigation valuations of the very asset that the Tribunal is being asked to value, and they are in

agreement with FTI’s DCF.*?!

2. Respondent’s Arguments

588. Respondent initially argued that the Tribunal, if it awards anything, should award Claimant its

amounts invested for Santa Ana: US$ 21,827,687.*” In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent amended
this, arguing that regardless of whether the Tribunal determines that there was a lawful or unlawful
expropriation or a non-expropriatory Treaty breach, the Tribunal should award Claimant no more
than US$ 18,237,592: the amount Claimant invested after the public necessity declaration.*? This
amount should be reduced, depending on the breach. For a non-expropriatory breach — like
Claimant’s alleged FET violation — there can be no damages, as the facts upon which Supreme Decree
032 was based were true.“ Non-expropriatory breaches require individualized damages analyses

and none have been provided to date.*”>

589. Respondent does not dispute that the FMV is the appropriate standard of compensation in this case.

This issue is how one can approximate FMV for a project like Santa Ana — a project that never (1)
advanced beyond project planning, (2) received the requisite permits, (3) obtained a social license

and community support, (4) proceeded to construction, or (5) operated profitably. These are all

features that make any measure other than the value of amounts invested highly speculative.*° Even

assuming that the Tribunal finds that Respondent’s measures breached the FTA, witness testimony

demonstrated that the lack of social license alone would have led to the Santa Ana Project’s failure.*?”

590. According to longstanding international law precedent, calculating damages using an income-based
method — like FTI’s DCF approach — is too speculative and, therefore, inappropriate, for an asset that
is not a “going concern” or that lacks a history of profitability.*°* In Wena v. Egypt, that tribunal
noted that a hotel that had been in operation for a year-and-a-half had an insufficient basis for
predicting growth or expansion of the investment. That tribunal held that “the proper calculation of
market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation is best arrived at,
in this case, by reference to Wena’s actual investments.”*” In PSEG v. Turkey, where claimant’ s
future income was established in contracts, the tribunal rejected income based approaches and

awarded damages based on the amount claimant had invested.**° This jurisprudence cannot be

dismissed as a “small sample”*"' or as “not a meaningful source of law.”** In speculative situations,

the proper way to compensate an injured claimant is to award it the amount it invested in the asset,

* These decisions reveal the untenable nature of

making it whole on its out-of-pocket losses. **
Claimant’s claim: if multi-year profitable business histories are insufficient to support a DCF
analysis, then the unapproved, incomplete business plans upon which Claimant relies cannot support
an income based valuation.*** Awarding the sunk costs for the FMV of a still-on-paper project like
Santa Ana is supported by numerous tribunals, including Metalclad v. Mexico and Mobil v.
Venezuela. To be clear: no Investor-State Tribunal has ever awarded damages based on a DCF
model for a non-producing asset.**°
591. Neither of the cases that Claimant cites — Vivendi IT v. Argentina and Gold Reserve v. Venezuela —
supports the proposition that a DCF analysis is the preferable method of valuing a pre-revenue
project.**” Vivendi IJ unambiguously rejected the use of the DCF method to value the early-stage
asset at issue in that case and awarded damages based on claimants’ amounts invested, due to the
speculative nature of assumptions and projections. That case, however, involved a far more
predictable asset that Claimant’s non-existent silver mines: a water services utility that had been in

operation for over two years under a 30-year concession contract.***

592. Unlike the case at hand, in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, both parties used the DCF method for assessing

the quantum of damages and agreed on the DCF model used. That tribunal merely applied the agreed-

upon valuation method. As to the question of why Venezuela accepted the DCF method, a close
reading of the award reveals that Venezuela likely agreed to the DCF approach because the cash flow
analysis that its expert put forward produced a negative valuation. Thus, Venezuela’s support of the
DCF analysis in that case was a strategic choice to reduce its liability, not a principled decision rooted
in a belief that the DCF valuation is appropriate for assets with no history of profitable operation.
Gold Reserve is, therefore, irrelevant to the question of whether a DCF analysis is preferable to
awarding amounts invested for a non-producing asset like the hypothetical mines here.*’ Finally,
Claimant’s citation of Gemplus v. Mexico, SPP v. Egypt, and Siag v. Egypt is puzzling, as each of
these tribunals explicitly rejected DCF-based valuations for investments with little or no operating

history — like Santa Ana.*“°

593. Assuming for the sake of argument that the Tribunal finds any basis for liability at all, this Tribunal

should reject DCF analysis and instead adopt the amounts invested approach, which rests on a
concrete and observable benchmark, rather than pti imation, and speculation.“! The
reference to FMV in the FTA should not impact the Tribunal’s analysis, as most of the cases analyzed
described “amounts invested” as a measure of “market value” under Treaty provisions analogous to

Article 812 of the FTA.”

594. The Tribunal should not compensate Claimant for any expenditures made prior to November 2007 —

the date at which Claimant obtained a right to operate at Santa Ana.*? Before 2007, Claimant
invested US$ 852,826 at Santa Ana and an additional US$ 2,986,112 during 2007. Respondent
submits that US$ 3,590,095 (corresponding to 11/12 of what was spent in 2007 as a proxy for
expenditures through November 27, 2007, plus US$ 852,826 prior to 2007) is an appropriate estimate

of Claimant’s expenditures prior to the issuance of the declaration. Thus, the Tribunal should
consider US$ 18,237,592 (Claimant's total US$ 21,827,687 expenditure, minus US$ 3,590,095 for

pre-Decree expenditures) to be the upper limit of Claimant’s potential recovery.

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

595. The Tribunal recalls that it found above that Respondent is liable for an unlawful indirect
expropriation. The FTA does not provide any rules regarding the damages to be awarded in case of
such a breach of the FTA. Accordingly, the standard provided under general international law is
applicable. The Tribunal notes that Article 812.2 of the FTA provides a specific provision on

compensation in respect of a lawful expropriation:

Such compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated
investment immediately before the expropriation took place (‘date of expropriation”), and
shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had
become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value
including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to
determine fair market value.

596. Both Parties agree and have argued in this context to use the FMV to quantify the damages that should
be awarded in case the Tribunal finds —as it has — that there was an unlawful expropriation.“ Since
damages for an unlawful expropriation should at least be as much as the compensation for a lawful
expropriation, in view of the joint approach by both Parties and the guidance provided by Article
812.2 of the FTA, the Tribunal agrees that the standard of FMV can be an appropriate method of

quantification in the present case.

597. The Parties appear to agree with the definition of FMV provided by Claimant’s expert as “the price,

expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change hands between a hypothetical

willing and able buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at arms-length in an open
and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have
reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.”*© The Tribunal sees no reason to adopt a different
approach. However, the Parties disagree as to whether, in order to meet that definition in the present
case, the calculation should rely on the amounts invested or, alternatively, on the potential

profitability of the investment as calculated by the DCF method.

The jurisprudence on which the Parties rely does not provide a general rule in this respect, although
it does emphasize the need to have regard to specific factual situation of each particular case. With
this in mind, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to focus on whether, having regard to the factual
circumstances of this case, a willing buyer might have been found who would have paid a price
calculated by the DCF method, as Claimant alleges. The Tribunal considers that Claimant has the

burden of proof with regard to damages it alleges.

The Tribunal is not persuaded that Claimant has provided sufficient evidence in support of its claim
that a hypothetical purchaser of the Santa Ana Project would have been able to obtain the necessary
social license to be able to proceed with the Project, if it had been provided an opportunity to invest
the necessary time and resources. Given the extent of the opposition, and the reasons for it, the
Tribunal doubts that the Project could, in the short term at least, be considered to be viable by the

time Supreme Decree 032 was adopted.

The Tribunal notes that the Santa Ana Project was still at an early stage and that it had not received
many of the government approvals and environmental permits it needed to proceed. On the basis of
the evidence before it, the Tribunal concludes that there was little prospect for the Project to obtain
the necessary social license to allow it to proceed to operation, even assuming it had received all
necessary environmental and other permits. The Tribunal notes that no similar projects operated in
the same area, and there was no evidence to support a track record of successful operation or

profitability in the future.

Claimant points out that in investment treaty cases some tribunals have endorsed DCF for early-stage

projects. In this context, Claimant refers to Vivendi v. Argentina, in which, although the tribunal

S46 CPHB-I 79; FTI First Report J 7.3 [CEX-001]; R-II 590.

ICSID ARB/14/21 226

rejected the DCF model, it nonetheless explained how such a model could be accepted in appropriate
circumstances.**” That tribunal noted that an absence of a history of profitability does not absolutely
preclude the use of DCF methodology, but clarified the necessity that “claimants might be able to
establish clearly that an investment, such as a concession, would have been profitable by presenting
sufficient evidence of its expertise and proven record of profitability of concessions it (or indeed
others) had operated in similar circumstances.”** In the present case, Claimant concedes that to
overcome a lack of history of profitability, it would need to produce convincing evidence of its ability
to produce profits in the particular circumstances it faced. Such evidence could include experience
(of its own or of experts) or corporate records that establish on the balance of probabilities it would

have produced profits from the concession in the face of the risks involved.”

602. In the view of the Tribunal, such convincing evidence has not been produced by Claimant. Beyond

the above-mentioned uncertainties regarding the realization of the Project, the Tribunal notes that, in
view of the widespread social unrest related to the Project, Respondent not only issued Supreme
Decree 032, but, right after on June 25, 2011, also issued a general suspension of admissions of
mining petitions for the Department of Puno by Supreme Decree 033°” for a period of 36 months

and later continued that suspension by Supreme Decree 021-2014.**!

603. A realization and assurance of the profitability of Claimant’s Santa Ana Project could therefore not

be expected in the foreseeable future, if at all. Thus, Claimant has not fulfilled the test introduced by
Claimant itself by its reference to Vivendi, as it has not been “able to establish clearly that an
investment, such as a concession, would have been profitable by presenting sufficient evidence of its
expertise and proven record of profitability of concessions it (or indeed others) had operated in

similar circumstances.”**?

604. In view of the above considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the calculation of Claimant’s
damages in the present case cannot be carried out by reference to the potential expected profitability
of the Santa Ana Project and the DCF method. The Project remained too speculative and uncertain
to allow such a method to be utilized. Instead, the Tribunal concludes that the measure of damages

should be made by reference to the amounts actually invested by Claimant.

B. ARGUMENTS RELATED TO THE DCF ANALYSIS / CLAIMANT’S DAMAGES ANALYSIS
RELATED TO THE SANTA ANA PROJECT

1. Claimant’s Arguments

605. Claimant’s experts, Messrs. Rosen and Milburn of FTI, determined Santa Ana’s FMV value to be
US$ 224.2 million on June 23, 2011 or, under the alternative long-term commodities price, US$
333.7 million.**

(a) The Valuation Date

606. Pursuant to Article 812(2) of the FTA, compensation for expropriation “shall be equivalent to the fair
market value of the expropriated investments immediately before the expropriation took place.”***
The most straightforward and objective way of excluding the effects of the June 24, 2011 public

announcement is to value Santa Ana on June 23, 2011 as FTI has done.**>

607. By insisting that June 24, 2011 should be the valuation date without proposing any method to exclude
the effects of the expropriation announcement, Respondent and its expert add confusion to what
should be straightforward and noncontroversial: the State may not benefit from any reduction in
value resulting from prior knowledge of the expropriation before it was formalized.*° By arguing

that the valuation date must be June 24, 2011, Brattle seeks to pretend that a 1% drop in the price of

silver would account for the dramatic drop (nearly 25%) in Claimant’s share price by the end of the
day on June 24, as the market quickly processed the announcement of the imminent expropriation

decree.**”

(b)  FTYs DCF Valuation

608. FTI is a world-recognized leader in the field of forensic accounting and damages valuation. FTI’s

experts relied in part on the expert report prepared by RPA, widely recognized as the specialty firm
of choice for resource and reserve work, which has performed valuations of more than one thousand

858 RPA reviewed and assessed

mineral exploration properties over its nearly 30 years of existence.
the reasonableness of the cost assumption used in connection with the Santa Ana Project.’ RPA
concluded that an appropriate economic analysis of Santa Ana can be conducted using the detailed
information in the Revised Feasibility Study and available data.“ To calculate the compensation
due to Claimant for Respondent’s breaches of the FTA, FTI and RPA used the DCF methodology,
which is widely used as a measure of damages in investment treaty arbitration.**' The DCF
methodology utilizes forecasted future cash flows and discounts them to a present date by applying a

risk adjusted discount rate.*

609. FTI calculated the FMV of the Santa Ana Project as of June 23, 2011 based on a cash flow model

provided by RPA. While the RPA “Revised Base Case” model only included reserves, FTI calculated
the FMV of the Santa Ana Project based on the RPA “Extended Life Case”, which included both
reserves and resources and is therefore consistent with CIMVAL’s requirement of inclusion of

863

resources in valuation models.**’ RPA’s extended life of mine case increases the life of the mine

from 11 to 24 years and includes additional “mineable Resources”, bringing the total volume of ore

projects. As Claimant explains:

428. FTI forecasted short-term commodities prices based on the futures curve on June
23, 2011. FTI based long-term commodities prices on indicators upon which
market participants relied, according to a survey of silver miners. FTI also
provided an alternative long-term price methodology based on the latest available
futures curve as of June 23, 2011. The discount rate that FTI applied was a
weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”) developed under a capital asset
pricing model (“CAPM”) approach, resulting in a discount rate of 10.0%.8°

610. FTI’s analysis is reasonable. FTI used alternative valuation methodologies to check the

reasonableness of its damages calculation using the DCF methodology. FTI analyzed Claimant’s
share price data over the period leading up to the Valuation Date and reports of analysts covering
Claimant. Claimant’s share price declined by 48% more than market indicators over the period
immediately prior to and after the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 (US$ 260.9 million). FTI

considers that this decline in value was incurred as a result of Respondent’s unlawful actions.*°”

868 RPA has made no adjustment to its

cost estimates and, in turn, FTA has made no adjustments to its DCF model. The Tribunal should
disregard the criticisms of Respondent and its experts as unfounded.* For example, the 35%
reduction in operating costs in the RPA Report reflects a change in cost that occurred between the

Feasibility Study and the Feasibility Study Update, from 5.36 to 4.20.8 As neither Brattle nor

Respondent will dispute, FTI’s silver price projection results in a lower valuation than does

Brattle’s.*7!

612. SRK misconstrues and misapplies cut-off grade concepts. There are two types of cut-off grade: the
“breakeven” cutoff grade (i.e., the external or mine cut-off grade) and the “internal or mill” cutoff
grade. The breakeven cutoff grade is the amount of revenue-bearing material that will cover the cost
of mining, processing side administrative costs, and off-site transport and smelting and refining costs.
The “internal or mill” cutoff grade, “applies when a tonne of material needs to be moved from an
open pit in order to access material above the breakeven cutoff grade.” The internal or mill cutoff
grade only applies once mining costs are covered and, thus, excludes mining costs. Contrary to SRK’s
argument that the breakeven cutoff grades should be used to report mineral resources and reserves,
RPA confirms that the accepted practice in the mining industry is to first estimate the volume of
material that can be mined and processed at the breakeven cutoff grade and then to report mineral
resources and reserves from within that volume at the internal or milling cutoff grade. Since SRK’s
comments regarding the use of cutoff grades in determining mineral resources and mineral reserves
are founded in practice that are not used or accepted in the industry, RPA made no adjustment to its
calculation of the Santa Ana resources and reserves.*” In closing, Claimant noted that the cutoff
grade is largely irrelevant because in the Extended Life case that is used for valuation, it is ultimately

the same tonnage of ore production.*”*

613. RPA states that SRK has provided no evidence to support its claim that the silver recovery factor (a
measure of the amount of metal contained in the ore that generates revenue) should be adjusted from
75% to 70% from the estimated silver recovery in the updated Feasibility Study.* The available

data does not justify holding the recovery rate at 70%. RPA provides detailed explanation of this in

maintained.*”°

614. The Santa Ana permitting, construction, and ramp up schedules are reasonable. RPA/FTI assume

that construction would have commenced in 2011 and entered production by the end of 2012. This
includes nine months for Respondent to review the ESIA and an additional six months to procure
permits, which exceeds the 6 to 12 months that SRK mentions. Regarding the social unrest, while it
is true that Respondent has experienced opposition to a number of mining projects, a number have
also proceeded without delays. RPA also points to projects in Peru of similar magnitude that achieved

a production schedule in line with Claimant’ s.'”°

615. In response to SRK’s criticism of Claimant’s construction and ramp up schedule for Santa Ana, RPA

explained that “‘it is totally incorrect to compare the detailed Gantt chart for Corani, which is a
milling operation, with the production schedule for Santa Ana, which is a simple heap leaching
operation’ because ‘[m{illing operations are much more complicated processing circuits that contain
a number of larger, more expensive, and more intricate unit operations such as crushing, grinding,
flotation, leaching, thickening, filtration, and tailings storage requirements.’”*” RPA reviewed the
contractor quotes by San Martin — who has operated in Peru for 23 years and has worked in high
altitudes — and those quotes incorporate allowances for the remote location and the altitude (overall

rate of US$ 1.68/t).8%

616. SRK’s recommended operation cost of US$ 2.50 per tonne mined, rather than RPA’s US$ 2.10, was

876

justified only with SRK’s suggestion that higher altitudes would lead to higher costs and lower labor

on a project at high altitudes and quoted those rates regarding Santa Ana accordingly. RPA, thus,

makes no adjustment to its operating cost assumptions.*”

617. Regarding capital costs, although Brattle argues that they were understated, Respondent’s technical

experts at SRK made no such criticism. In response, Claimant states that “FT offers a number of

reasons why Brattle’s proposed increase in capital costs should be rejected.”**°

618. As in any mining project, a hypothetical FMV purchaser would account for the risk that local

opposition may delay or prevent the full development of a project.**! Respondent’s argument that a
“social license risk’ of 27 or 80% should be imposed on the Santa Ana Project undervalues Santa
Ana. §*? If a 27 or 80% social license risk were truly justified it would be reflected in the
contemporaneous evidence. Instead, Respondent’s proposed adjustment is created with hindsight

information.**°

FTI’s DCF valuation properly adjusts for risks inherent to the mining industry and
adjusts for social license risk through (1) the discount rate, (2) the country risk premium for operating

in Peru, and (3) up-front annual operating expenses for community relations efforts at Santa Ana.***

619. In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant explained that the Tribunal can test the reasonableness of FTI’s

valuation by cross-referencing seven independent evaluations made by market analysts outside of the

arbitration — an approach that the Gold Reserve tribunal adopted.**°

of which, from CIMVAL, notes that it is not widely used or understood, but it is gaining in acceptance.
According to FTI, no analyst appears to have valued Santa Ana using a “modern” DCF. Despite
Brattle’s preference for the “modern” DCF, it has used a standard DCF in every published award
where it has acted as an expert. FTI concludes that, while it may have relevance for other purposes,

the “modern” DCF is inappropriate in the context of determining the FMV of a mineral project.**°

621. The only concrete suggestion Brattle makes is that FTI should have used multiple discount rates for
each different cash flow and each year, albeit without suggesting what the discount rates should be.
FTI concludes that “the preponderance of additional assumptions necessary to apply a multiple
discount rate approach would only serve to provide an illusion of a level of precision that does not
exist,” and FTI has not seen evidence that this actually is done in practice. FTI concluded that
Brattle’s suggested changes to FTI’s DCF methodology would not improve the reliability of the

resulting calculation of Santa Ana’s FMV.**”

(d) Arguments Related to Brattle’s Stock-Price Analysis

622. In its initial report, FTI reviewed Claimant’s share price as part of its market-based approach analysis,
but concluded that the share price as of the Valuation Date does not provide a reliable measure of the
FMV of the underlying Santa Ana or Corani projects. On any given day, the share price would reflect
investor sentiment for a block of shares, not for the underlying assets. Furthermore, it is also common
for insiders and institutional investors to make long-term investments in shares of a junior mining
company and to hold the shares and not trade them on an active basis, such that it is most common to
see trading activity in shares of junior being made up of retail investors.*** In contrast, the market for
buyers for 100% of Claimant’s shares would predominantly consist of larger mining companies who
would be willing to pay a premium for the mining properties due to their lower cost of capital.

According to Mergerstat data, at the Valuation Date, acquisition premia averaging 63.7% over trading

prices were being paid for mining companies, due to the efficiency of the larger firm’s capital or some
other synergy that can uniquely be enjoyed by the buyer. FTI’s calculation of the intrinsic value of
Santa Ana employed a discount rate of typical buyers of these types of assets and, thus, included this

premium. **?

623. On the Valuation Date, Claimant’s Projects were undervalued, due to noise in the marketplace relating

to political issues and anti-mining protests in Peru. From the date of the ESIA suspension to the first
trading date after expropriation, Claimant’s share price dropped by 56.5%, compared to a 7.3% and
9.8% decline in the price of silver and the S&P/TSX Global Mining Index, respectively. This is
equivalent to a decrease in enterprise value of US$ 260.9 million. In the “but for” analysis of
damages, Santa Ana is built and, therefore, these issues must be ignored to restore Claimant to the

economic position it would have been in absent Respondent’s breaches.”

624. In its Post-Hearing Brief, Claimant explained that Brattle’s “modern” DCF is essentially a Market

Approach masquerading as an Income Approach. A Market Approach, however, is not an appropriate
valuation method because Claimant’s share value is not an accurate reflection of Santa Ana’s FMV
and it ignores Claimant’s acquisition of US$ 130 million in financing.**' Even when companies are
consensually acquiring one another, they do not rely on share price on that date — neither offeror nor
target company bases its price assessment on a share price, but rather forms a committee to perform

an evaluation.*”

625. Brattle’s valuation begins with the erroneous conclusion that the stock price equals FMV and works

889

804

backwards to justify that conclusion,**? which is how they arrive at this 27 or 80% social license risk
adjustment range.*** The Harvard study on which they rely is unreliable, counting suspended projects

as failures and likely counts expropriated projects as failures, too — creating a failure rate of 30 —

43%.*°5 FTI’s DCF Model is preferable and accounts for these risks in the discount rate and the

626. FTI reviewed seven analysts’ contemporaneous views on Claimant’s share price and the net asset

value of the Santa Ana Project before the expropriation and concluded that the Project had a net asset
value of US$ 257.8 million on average (US$ 237.5 million if one removes the highest and lowest
analyst conclusions). These values support FTI’s DCF and stand in marked contrast to Brattle’s cost-
based and stock-price analyses, as well as its adjusted DCF.**° Further adjustments can be made on

the Tribunal’s demand.”

(e) The Impact of a Finding of Contributory Negligence and/or Fault (Tribunal’s
Question (e)(iv))

627. The following arguments were presented in response to Members of the Tribunal’s questions during

the Hearing, and in response to the Tribunal’s question “What are the monetary amounts that the
Tribunal should award to the Claimant if [...] the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had
contributed to the social unrest that occurred in the spring of 2011 — by act or omission — how should
such a contribution be taken into account in determining matters of liability and/or quantum”
contained at section (e) of PO-10.*°* Relevant answers to the Tribunal’s questions regarding “the
monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if it were to conclude that (i) the
Claimant's alleged investment was lawfully expropriated”*” and whether Supreme Decree 032 could
have been legally issued if “the alleged illegality of Claimant's Application” could be established, are

included for ease of reference.”

Application — “one could draw the conclusion that something doesn’t seem quite right here.”°®°
According to Mr. Zegarra, the Government could have requested more information to correct a good
faith error.”” In any event, Article 71 would not have applied to “exploration” but rather only to
“exploitation” or production.’ After Arbitrator Sands pointed out that page 28 of the relevant
Application expressly stated that “to date, no explorations in the area of the Santa Ana Mining Project

have been conducted”, even though nearly US$ | million of exploration work had been completed,”

Claimant explained that it was advised by top mining counsel in Peru in preparing the application.°'°
In any event, the issuance of Supreme Decree 032 was an extreme response.°'' Even Respondent’ s
expert agreed that a violation of Article 71 does not justify expropriation, and certainly without due

process or compensation.?!”

630. Arbitrator Sands then asked, assuming that the difficulties faced by the Project could have been
caused by Claimant’s lack of candor as to who was in charge of the Project, what legal impact would
that have on the Tribunal’s need to address issues of jurisdiction, merits, and quantum. Rejecting the
factual premise, Claimant stated that, although that issue arose in Copper Mesa and Claimant did not
believe it should affect either liability or quantum, if it were to have an effect, it would be on a sliding

scale based on the seriousness of the purported wrongdoing.°"?

631. Claimant noted that a finding of contributory negligence would need to be based on Claimant’s

government-approved community outreach.°'*

2. Respondent’s Arguments

632. Respondent’s expert, Brattle, valued the Santa Ana Project at US$ 54 million in the base case and
US$ 70 million in the extended life case, after correcting FTI’s inputs.°!* Using its modern DCF
model, Brattle calculated Santa Ana’s value as of June 23, 2011 as ranging from US$ 32 — US$ 119
million and on May 27, 2011 as ranging from US$ 40 million to US$ 113 million.°!°

633. The Tribunal has been presented with 3 options for valuing the Santa Ana asset: (1) FTI’s simple
DCF analysis, (2) Brattle’s modern DCF analysis, and (3) the sunk costs. The Tribunal should reject
FTI’s simple DCF analysis as unreliable, methodologically weak, and based on false pretenses. While
Brattle’s modern DCF analysis is more reliable and transparent than FTI’s, the DCF method is still

inappropriate. This analysis, although an improvement upon FTI’s simple DCF, further confirms that

DCF analysis is unsuited for a non-producing asset. This Tribunal should, therefore, reject the use of

DCF valuation for this non-producing asset.”!”

(a) The Valuation Date

634. Respondent has not presented any arguments related specifically to the Valuation Date, but denies all

allegations not expressly admitted.°'*

635. However, the Tribunal notes that, in its Memorials, Respondent treats the Valuation Date as either
June 23, 2011 (assuming Supreme Decree 032 is unlawful) or May 27, 2011 (assuming ESIA delay

unlawful).?!?

(b)  FTYs DCF Valuation

636. FTI’s simple DCF methodology is imprecise and unreliable because it fails to capture differences in

the risk of separate cash flows — including pivotal inputs like metal prices and mining costs — and
assumes simply and unrealistically that all cash flows “become exponentially riskier over time.”
FTI uses the discount rate to account for project uncertainty and subsumes all risks into a single, blunt

“risk premium component of the discount rate’, regardless of their impact or probabilities. As Brattle

pp luding operating costs and metal recovery
rates — as opposed to actual technical inputs that would have been available, had Santa Ana ever
reached production. FTI relies entirely on estimates adopted from RPA that contain further
inaccuracies in key technical inputs that further inflate Claimant’s claims and render FTI’s simple
DCF analysis even more inaccurate and unreliable. Most saliently, these inputs are (1) overstated
mineral reserves and resources, (2) understated mining costs, (3) overly ambitious production

timelines, and (4) overstated silver prices.”’* Without endorsing FTI’s DCF approach, Brattle re-ran
FTI’s model with proper, corrected values for (1) a “base case” considering only mineral reserves
and (2) an “extended life case” considering mineral reserves and mineral resources. Correcting just
the flawed parameters, FTI’s Santa Ana damages estimate drops from US$ 191 million to US$ 54
million in the base case and from US$ 224 million to US$ 70 million in the extended life case.°
These numbers, however, do not account for any risk to the Santa Ana Project due to community
opposition.°* This failure to account for social unrest is another reason the Tribunal should reject
FTI’s DCF valuation.°?> Mr. Milburn’s suggestion that a line item for $200,000 per year in the annual

cash flows might represent the social-license risk should be rejected.°”°

reserve and resource estimates.°* RPA applied an inappropriately low cut-off grade of 17.5 grams
of silver per metric ton for reserves and 14 grams for resources. It would have been more appropriate
to have a breakeven cut-off grade of 30 grams per metric ton and an internal/milling cutoff grade of
27 grams per metric ton, as was applied in Claimant’s 2011 Feasibility Study for Santa Ana. Using
the lower cut-off grade, the base case reserves are inflated by 24%, i.e. from the 37 million metric
tons stated in Claimant’s 2011 Feasibility Study to 46 million metric tons claimed in RPA’s reports.
From that inflated base, RPA generated an even more speculative extended life case, with mineral
potential of 81 million metric tons. SRK confirms that RPA made errors in both the nature of the cut-
off grade applied and the quantum of the cut-off grade, as a result of using inflated silver prices and
unrealistic silver metallurgical recoveries. This resulted in a gross overstatement of resources and
reserves in both the base case and the extended life case.°”? FTI’s incorporation of these figures into

its DCF valuation inflated its estimate.°*°

low. SRK noted that RPA’s analysis overlooked Claimant’s plan to use a contract miner at Santa
Ana — one that would have to charge the costs actually incurred in order to generate a profit.*!
Furthermore, Santa Ana is more than 4000 meters above sea level in the remote high Andes. This
extreme environment can lead to health problems for workers and mechanical equipment failure
which result in lower labor and equipment productivity and, therefore, higher operating costs.°? SRK
maintains its recommended increase in the projected mining costs from US$ 2.10 per tonne of
material to US$ 2.50 per tonne of material. This estimate falls below an estimate prepared by

Infomine — an independent organization that provides data on the mining industry.°**

640. Brattle asked SRK to prepare a mine plan that was consistent with RPA’s intent to support an
“extended case” — i.e., one that values some of the less certain mineral resources in addition to the
more certain mineral reserves — with SRK’s recommended technical parameters for mine planning
and Brattle’s silver price projections. Using this adjusted extended case in FTI’s DCF model reduced
FTI’s extended life case from US$ 224 million to US$ 178 million and the base case from US$ 191

million to US$ 166 million.°*

641. Brattle also includes a 14% increase in capital costs that corrects (using empirical studies of mining
cost overruns) for the tendency within the industry to significantly understate project costs in mining
feasibility studies. Brattle rejects FTI’s objection to this adjustment noting, inter alia, that the
Chairman of RPA, Mr. Graham Clow, shares Brattle’s view that feasibility studies typically
underestimate capital costs (in his estimate, by 20-25%).°* This adjustment further reduces the value
of the extended case from US$ 178 million to US$ 170 million and the base case value from US$ 166

million to US$ 158 million.°*°

642. Brattle, SRK, and Respondent’s Peruvian mining law expert all agree that FTI’s DCF analysis adopts
an unrealistic and overly aggressive production timeline that failed to account for delays due to (1)
permitting, (2) social unrest and protests, and (3) operational issues and construction problems.°*”
SRK reaffirms that permitting delays are to be expected. As of June 2011, Claimant had obtained
none of the necessary land use agreements with communities or land holders and still needed to
receive approximately 40 permits and approvals before proceeding to production. Approval of these
permits and approvals was not automatic or assured. It would have been difficult or impossible to

begin production in the fourth quarter of 2012, as stated.°**

643. Other mining projects that faced social unrest experienced delays averaging four years. FTI ignored

the potential impact of social unrest, pursuant to an unsupportable legal instruction to attribute social
unrest to the Government. Community opposition arises independently of the Government and, as
other stalled projects in Peru have shown, community opposition can thwart a mining project even
when it received permits.°*? Given the long history of popular uprisings against the mining industry
in Peru and that Santa Ana was already the target of protests, it is implausible to assume away social
opposition.“ Social unrest was the biggest challenge facing the Project and it is nowhere to be found

in RPA’s or FTI’s calculations.

644. Operational difficulties, such as staff recruitment in a remote region or construction problems would

cause further delays.” Accordingly, Brattle extended FTI’s preproduction timeline by four years.
This further lowers the value of Santa Ana under FTI’s model.*? Factoring this additional delay into
FTI’s DCF model further lowers the value of Santa Ana to US$ 54 million in the base case and to

US$ 70 million in the extended life case.°“

method, FTI projects prices by combining commodity futures prices with projections of silver spot
prices — Brattle explains that this is inconsistent with finance principles.* FTI’s flawed pricing leads
to absurd results. FTI’s projected silver price for 2015 is US$ 30.78 per ounce. For 2016, FTI
abandons futures pricing and adopts pricing based on forecasted price projections, dropping the price
to US$ 22.21 per ounce. This dramatic one year drop does not reflect any anticipated drop in prices
— it results solely from the inconsistent methodology FTI adopts.**° In FTI’s second pricing method,
FTI isolates the last available silver futures price as of the date of valuation and holds that price

constant in perpetuity. FTI fails to adjust its discount rate to account for this self-evidently imprecise

approach, even though the use of futures prices accounts for pricing risks that FTI purports to include

in its discount rate.” Both pricing methods are inaccurate and inappropriate.

646. Brattle did not perform an independent silver price projection, but the April 2011 Updated Feasibility

Study for Santa Ana used a silver price of US$ 13 per ounce — far lower than both of FTI’s projections.
The adoption of US$ 13 per ounce must have reflected Claimant’s and its consultant's view of silver

prices going forward.™*

(c) Arguments Related to Brattle’s Modern (“real options”) DCF Model

647. Brattle’s modern (“real options”) DCF analysis, properly calibrated with Claimant’s value

established in the stock market, demonstrates that FTI has drastically overvalued Santa Ana.” The
modern DCF approach removes much of the inherent volatility and imprecision of FTI’s model.°*°
Each cash flow item receives its own discount for risk and these individual cash flows are used to
produce an overall project valuation. The modern approach is well suited for mining projects because

clear market indicators exist for many of the key individual cash flow streams.°*!

648. Brattle’s modern (“real options”) DCF identifies and corrects for risks to cash flows that FTI’s simple

947

948

949

950

951

952

953

DCF analysis cannot detect. First, Brattle’s approach takes advantage of market inputs to forecast
cashflows and transparently quantify risks that might impact those cash flows. Second, Brattle’s
approach is calibrated to consider the FMV of the asset as measured by reference to Claimant’s
enterprise value (share price).?? Calibration using the share price is essential to incorporate the
substantial and enduring “social license” risk on Santa Ana’s value. FTI ignores this risk altogether,

leading it to overvalue Santa Ana.*?

649. Since Claimant’s share price reflects the value of both Santa Ana and Corani, Brattle valued Corani

as well. Regarding Corani, SRK and Brattle uncovered a technical risk related to metallurgy that
could render the Corani Project infeasible or reduce its market value.’ Taking these values, Brattle
calculated Santa Ana’s value as of June 23, 2011 as ranging from US$ 32 — US$ 119 million and on
May 27, 2011 as ranging from US$ 40 million to US$ 113 million.°°> When combined with the

value of Corani, these values — although a broad range — are consistent with Claimant’s share price.°*°

650. Brattle has refuted each of FTI’s arguments against the modern DCF approach.°*’ CIMVAL - the

preeminent professional organization in the field of mineral valuation — recognizes the modern DCF
approach as a primary valuation method. FTI claims to conduct its valuation consistently with its
standards and guidelines, making FTI’s suggestion that the modern DCF approach can be ignored
nonsensical.°** Modern DCF methodology is mainstream in academic circles and in valuations by
large mining companies and royalty companies.” FTI’s criticism of the alleged “subjectivity” of the
modern DCF approach is invalid, as the modern approach requires fewer assumptions than FTI’s
model and Brattle’s analysis replaced FTI’s assumptions about metal prices and the Project discount
rate with market-based forecasts of the same.** Some of FTI’s criticisms, however, apply to all
income-based approaches, including FTI’s own DCF model. Imprecision exists in any cash flow
based valuation, and these imprecisions only intensify when valuing an asset with no history of
operational cash flows, significant but unquantified social license risk, or where the share price

includes other values — here, like Santa Ana and Corani.°*!

651. Stock analysis further confirms that FTI has drastically overvalued Santa Ana.

(d) Arguments Related to Brattle’s Stock Analysis

°2 Brattle presented a

market-based benchmark valuation based on Claimant’s enterprise value (calculated as Claimant’s
share price — a direct measure of the combined FMV of all of the company’s assets — multiplied by
the number of outstanding shares on the day in question) multiplied by the percentage of Claimant’s
total value attributable to Santa Ana alone.°* The only uncertainty is the apportionment of value
between Claimant’s two assets, Santa Ana and Corani.*%™ Brattle adopted the same estimates that FTI
used to value Corani, i.e., that it accounted for on average 19.2% of Claimant's total market value.°®
Using the average of the analyst allocations, the Santa Ana portion of Claimant’s total value
corresponded to US$ 89.1 million on June 23, 2011 (where Claimant’s enterprise value was US$ 464
million) and US$ 104.3 million on May 27, 2011 (where Claimant’s enterprise value was US$ 543.5

million).°%

652. FTI tries to explain the more than US$ 130 million disconnect between its US$ 224.2 million

valuation and the average US$ 89.1 million benchmark based on Claimant’s stock price by arguing
that the market-analysis fails to account for the “acquisition premium.”°* This criticism is meritless.
When acquisitions occur at a premium, it reflects perceived synergies created through the sale. Not
only do these not materialize in every sale, but Brattle noted and Prof. Damodaran agrees, the
possibility of a synergistic acquisition is already reflected in Claimant’s share price, because a buyer

of the shares would stand to benefit from an acquisition at a premium.°*

The application of
acquisition premiums to any valuation based on share price is controversial among valuation
professionals and must take specific circumstances of the valuation target into account. FTI, however,

has used the average acquisition premium in other mining transactions.°” In doing so, FTI has

(e) The Impact of a Finding of Contributory Negligence and/or Fault (Tribunal’s
Question (e)(iv))

653. The following arguments were presented in response to Members of the Tribunal’s questions during

the Hearing, and in response to the Tribunal’s question “What are the monetary amounts that the

Tribunal should award to the Claimant i,

 

[...] the Tribunal was to find that the Claimant had
contributed to the social unrest that occurred in the spring of 2011 — by act or omission — how should
such a contribution be taken into account in determining matters of liability and/or quantum”

contained at section (e) of PO-10.°7!

654. If the Tribunal agrees that the social unrest was a direct consequence of Claimant’s conduct —

including Claimant’s unlawful scheme to acquire rights and its failure to win the support of local
communities — it should not award damages at all.°”? Alternatively, if the Tribunal concludes that

Claimant’s conduct contributed to Claimant’s damages, the Tribunal must reduce any award in

973

proportion to that contribution.”’’ The cases cited by Claimant demonstrate that the Tribunal may

consider any contributory fault — not just “but for” harm — and may reduce damages accordingly.°

655. Claimant’s suggestion that the Tribunal could simply tinker with the DCF model or simply subtract
money from the damages calculation to account for contributory negligence or harm is fundamentally
flawed.°”> First, it is only an option if the Tribunal adopts a DCF model, which it should not.°”

Second, Claimant’s approach does not reduce damages to account for Claimant’s unlawful scheme

to acquire rights at Santa Ana, which contributed to the harm Claimant faced. Third, Claimant’s

approach assumes that if Claimant spent just a few million dollars more, it would have obtained a

social license.°”” If Claimant could have solved its community relations problems for simply a few

million dollars, it is unclear why it failed to do so at the time.°”®

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

656. The Tribunal recalls that it has concluded that it is not possible in the present case to calculate the
damages by relying on the expected profitability and the DCF method. Having so concluded, the
Tribunal will not address the Parties’ discussions related to the DCF method for its conclusions on

damages. Rather, this Award will focus on the value of what Claimant actually invested.

657. In this context, the Tribunal notes that those members of the indigenous population that opposed the
Santa Ana Project have achieved their wishes: the Project is well and truly at an end. However, this
does not relieve Respondent from paying reasonable and appropriate damages for its breach of the
FTA. The Project was supported by the Government until the end when the Government panicked
and arbitrarily put it at an end. The Government purportedly acted on a document, the existence of
which could not be shown. The Government did not put its concerns to or otherwise hear Claimant.
However, neither the FTA nor general international law provides an option to award punitive
damages. Therefore, the only further option to calculate damages, as the DCF method cannot be
applied, is the one also discussed by the Parties, i.e. the costs invested by Claimant. The Tribunal

considers that this is indeed the appropriate method to calculate damages in the present case.

Respondent initially argued that the Tribunal, if it awards anything, should award Claimant these US$
21,827,687 as the amounts Claimant invested for Santa Ana.°” In its Post-Hearing Brief, however,
Respondent adopted a different approach, arguing that regardless of whether the Tribunal determines
that there was a lawful or unlawful expropriation or a non-expropriatory treaty breach, the Tribunal
should award Claimant no more than US$ 18,237,592 as the amount Claimant invested after the

issuance of Supreme Decree 083.

The Tribunal notes that Claimant is not claiming for its expenditures prior to the issuance of Supreme
Decree 083. In that respect, the Tribunal accepts the calculation presented by Respondent that
these expenditures amount to US$ 3,590,095."*! Therefore, the remaining amount of the above total

of US$ 21,827,687, i.e. US$ 18,237,592 is now undisputed between the Parties.

The Tribunal sees no reason not to accept this amount and therefore concludes that Claimant’s
expenditures after the issuance of Supreme Decree 083 and up to the issuance of Supreme Decree

032 amounted to US$ 18,237,592.

Though the Parties have conducted their discussion of contributory negligence or fault with focus on
the DCF method, this aspect could also to be considered with regard to the calculation method

accepted by the Tribunal relying on the value of the actual investment.

There is a disagreement between the members of the Tribunal in this regard. Co-Arbitrator Prof.
Sands, while agreeing that Respondent breached the FTA and is liable, as discussed in his Dissenting
Opinion, concludes that the assessment of damages should be reduced. The majority of the Tribunal
feels it cannot agree and shortly comments on the major arguments on which our colleague Sands

relies.

First, as Prof. Sands concedes, the ILO Convention 169 imposes direct obligations only on States.
Contrary to Respondent’ s arguments, private companies cannot “fail to comply” with ILO Convention
169 because it imposes no direct obligations on them. The Convention adopts principles on how
community consultations should be undertaken, but does not impose an obligation of result. It does

not grant communities veto power over a project. The relevant examination is whether the

consultations were conducted in good faith, adjusted to the circumstances of the Project and the
affected community, and conducted with the objective of reaching agreement. As concluded above

in this Award, Claimant has not breached that expectation.

Second, the majority cannot agree with Prof. Sands’s evaluation of the evidence. Regarding the
involvement of Ms. Villavicencio, the Tribunal recalls its conclusion above in this Award: “Jn
conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the first reason given in Supreme Decree 032 and in Respondent's
arguments, i.e. that Claimant had illegally obtained the public necessity declaration by Supreme

Decree 083 through the involvement of Ms. Villavicencio, is not valid.”

Third, regarding particularly the testimony of Respondent’s expert witness Prof. Peiia Jumpa on
which Prof. Sands heavily relies and which he accepts, while discarding Claimant’s witnesses and
experts as having limited knowledge and expertise, the majority recalls its conclusion above in this
Award: “The evidence summarized above shows that from the very beginning until the time before
the meeting of June 23, 2011, all outreach activities by Claimant were known to Respondent's
authorities and were conducted with their approval, support, and endorsement, and that no objections
were raised by the authorities in this context. While, as mentioned above, further actions by Claimant
would have been feasible, on the basis of the continued coordination with and support by
Respondent’s authorities, the Tribunal concludes that Claimant could take it for granted to have
complied with all legal requirements with regard to its outreach to the local communities.
Respondent, afier its continuous approval and support of Claimant’s conduct, cannot in hindsight
claim that this conduct was contrary to the ILO Convention 169 or was insufficient, and caused or
contributed to the social unrest in the region.” The indigenous communities, irrespective whether
they were in favor of or against the Project, are not respondent party in this arbitration. Rather, the
State of Peru and its Government are Respondent and it is their conduct which the Tribunal has to

decide upon.

In this context, the Tribunal recalls its conclusions above when considering contributory fault and
liability: “Respondent has the burden of proof that its breaches of the FTA, which the Tribunal found
in its considerations above in this Award, were to some extent caused by Claimant. In view of the
above cited conclusions of the Tribunal, Respondent has not met that burden. Therefore, the Tribunal

concludes that there was no contributory fault and liability of Claimant.”

ICSID ARB/14/21 251

668. For the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the above damages amount of US$ 18,237,592 is

not to be reduced due to contributory fault or liability of Claimant.

Cc Compensation For the Corani Project and the Tribunal’s Question (e)(ii)
669. Many of the arguments summarized below were also repeated in response to the Tribunal’s question:

e) What are the monetary amounts that the Tribunal should award to the Claimant if
it were to conclude that:

[J]

ii. the Claimant's alleged investment was unlawfilly expropriated?>*
1. Claimant’s Arguments

670. FTI calculated the reduction in value of Corani immediately following the expropriation date in a
range from US$ 59.6 million (deducting the full FMV of Santa Ana Project) to US$ 276.3 (without
ascribing any value to the Santa Ana Project).°** FTI quantified the reduction in value of Corani

resulting from Respondent’s taking of Santa Ana at US$ 170.6 million (19.2%).°**

671. Respondent’s expropriation of Santa Ana and other FTA violations caused substantial additional
damage to Claimant by irretrievably hindering the development of the Corani Project.°> The harm
and causation are self-evident: immediately following Respondent’s suspension of the Santa Ana
ESIA and immediately following the expropriation, Claimant’s enterprise value plummeted, as a
direct result. Mr. Swarthout unambiguously explains that these actions precluded Claimant from
obtaining financing for the Corani Project and, “unless [Claimant] receives compensation in this
arbitration for Peru’s taking of Santa Ana”, Claimant will not be able to finance Corani.°*° His
testimony confirms the basic economics that the increased cost of capital implies that future

expansion projects will not be economically viable. The company’s future cash flows are much less

valuable, in that they are discounted more heavily. This leads to a loss in value.°*’ FTI established a
causal link between the additional cost of financing and the increased risk-profile of the Project and
the decrease in Corani’s value. The losses asserted by Claimant are based on an undisputed decrease
in Claimant’s enterprise value between the last day of trading prior to the ESIA suspension and the
first day of trading following the announcement of Supreme Decree 032. °** Respondent
acknowledges that this decrease in Claimant’s enterprise value was caused by its actions, though it

characterized this damage as not “/asting.”*

Four and a half years later, however, Claimant’s share
price sits close to its historical low and the Corani Project remains undeveloped, due to lack of
financing and the Project’s increased risk profile. Regardless of future events, Claimant will not

be able to recover this loss.*!

672. Under international law, legal causation is satisfied if the losses sustained are a normal, foreseeable,
or proximate consequence of the unlawful conduct. Here, the chain of causation follows two steps,

which Claimant has established on the balance of probabilities:

a) As a consequence of Peru’s expropriation of Santa Ana, Claimant has to raise more
money at a higher financing rate, while having fewer options than if it retained
control of the Santa Ana project; the Corani project has become riskier to develop;
and the development of Corani has been delayed, leading to a permanent loss of
income for the period of delay

b) These events caused a direct, normal and foreseeable financial loss to Bear Creek
measured by FTI as the decrease in Bear Creek’s enterprise value between the last
trading day prior to the ESIA suspension and the first trading day after the
expropriation ’s announcement.””

673. Claimant’s position is supported by case law in other instances where Investor-State tribunals have

grappled with causation issues. For example, in Jnmaris Perestoika v. Ukraine, the tribunal found

that the wrongful ban that prevented the ship from leaving Ukrainian territorial waters and the ensuing
lack of revenue was a proximate or foreseeable cause of claimants’ bankruptcy in Germany.
Following steps in a chain of causation, that tribunal awarded lost profits for the additional ten years

°°3 Lemire v. Ukraine

of operation that would have followed had claimants not gone into bankruptcy.
is also instructive. There, the tribunal recognized the uncertainty and the assumptions in the causation
chain and awarded damages because, to do otherwise, would reward Ukraine for its unlawful conduct.
This Tribunal need not go as far as the Jnmaris or Lemire tribunals were willing to go in order to find
a causal link between Respondent’s conduct and Claimant’s Corani damages. Respondent’s

arguments on causation are unsupported and must be rejected.°*

674. Losses are compensable under the full reparation standard, as stated by the PCIJ in Chorzéw.
Pursuant to Chorzow and as reflected in Article 36 of the ILC Articles, compensation should include
both (1) the monetary equivalent of restitution and (2) additional damages for loss sustained that
would not otherwise be covered by restitution or its monetary equivalent. Corani falls under this

second category.”

Applying this principle, various investment tribunals have awarded damages in
addition to compensation for expropriated assets. In Sedco v. NIOC, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal
awarded compensation for the replacement value of the expropriated old rigs, as well as other losses
in the form of lost income not generated due to the expropriation. In Vivendi IJ, the tribunal awarded
compensation for full destruction of value, as well as additional losses that included cost of sponsored
debt and management fees. Tribunals have also awarded compensation for the additional cost of

financing sustained as a result of a State’s wrongful conduct.”

675. The second corollary that follows from the full reparation standard is that the amount of damages
need not be proven with absolute certainty for the losses to be compensable. Under Chorzéw and as

confirmed recently in Vivendi II, the test is the balance of probabilities.°””

676. Any difficulty in assessing Corani’s damages is the result of Respondent’s breaches of the FTA. This
Tribunal should not punish Claimant by allowing Respondent to benefit from this wrongful conduct.
Rather, Claimant refers the Tribunal to the tribunal’s decision in Gemplus & Talsud v. Mexico and
states that assessing damages attributable to Corani is a complex exercise that involves estimation
and approximation. The damages could not be more real and are compensable under international
law."

677. Respondent’s allegation that FTI’s quantum methodology “produces an absurdly broad range of
damages estimates” is unfounded. FTI’s calculations are based on real, undisputed market event: the
change in value before the ESIA suspension until after the expropriation, amounting to US$ 307.2
million. The conservative range provided by FTI reflects an allocation of enterprise value that the

market could have placed on Santa Ana on May 27, 2011, prior to the ESIA suspension.”

678. The source of damage to the value of Corani lies in the cost of capital that is available to Claimant to
develop the mine, as well as the associated delay. Without the development of Santa Ana, the sources
of capital that will be available to develop Corani, if any, will come from the issuance of equity of a
much smaller company with a lower market capitalization. The resulting dilution to investors and

the cost of this equity will undoubtedly exceed the cost of capital that would have been available had

Santa Ana been allowed to proceed as anticipated. The damage to Corani is tangible, has been

experienced, and is permanent. '°”

679. FTI was unable to prepare a DCF analysis for Corani because it would require subjective assumptions
that would not support an objective opinion on damages. Claimant explains that “while [Claimant's]
share price does not provide a reliable measure of FMV of the underlying assets (both Santa Ana and
Corani), and understates the adverse effect on the value of Corani of [Respondent's] actions against
Santa Ana, FTI concludes that the only available objective measure of the change in perceived value
to Corani is the change in the price of [Claimant's] shares at the Valuation Date.”

680. FTI calculated the reduction in value of Corani immediately following the expropriation date in a
range from US$ 59.6 million (deducting the full FMV of Santa Ana Project) to US$ 276.3 (without
ascribing any value to the Santa Ana Project).'%? FTI quantified the reduction in value of Corani
resulting from Respondent's taking of Santa Ana at US$ 170.6 million. This is the point estimate for
FTI’s damages conclusion because FTI did not believe that the market would have priced the full
Santa Ana FMV into Claimant’s share price at the time. Thus, FTI deducted 19.2% for value
attributable to Santa Ana (representing the average net asset value, which ranged from 9.1% to 32.2%)
and adjusted for the 7.3% decline in the S&P/TSX Global Mining Index over the referenced period.
FTI also deducted the full enterprise value attributable to Corani on June 27, 2011, which FTI equated
to the retained value of Corani following the expropriation.' This method likely understates the
effect of the damages on the value of Corani substantially. The consensus of independent industry
analysts placed a value of approximately US$ 1.1 billion on Corani. Given the share price at the
current time, the diminution appears to be in excess of FTI’s calculation of damages. Although
Claimant’s share price understates the FMV of Corani, and hence the observed decrease in Claimant’s
enterprise value after the expropriation will also understate the damages to Corani, the calculation in

the FTI Report provides the best estimate with the information available.'°~

681. FTI addresses Brattle’s concerns in its second report.!°° Brattle’s assertion that Claimant has not
experienced an increase in financing costs to date is hollow, especially in light of Mr. Swarthout’s
testimony. Common sense dictates that the loss of Santa Ana made Corani more difficult to finance
and this financing difficulty has caused the Project to be delayed. The delay was not the result of a
managerial decision due to technical factors or market conditions, nor did it result in a net benefit, as
Brattle argues. Technical optimization studies were clearly contemplated and were independent of
market conditions. '°°

682. The market has recognized that Claimant’s ability to raise the nearly US$ 700 million needed to
develop Corani has been permanently diminished and has accordingly reduced its view of the value
of the Corani Project. The events in Santa Ana also increased Corani’s risk profile beyond the threat
of Corani itself being expropriated. FTI noted that Brattle agrees that an increased risk profile would
reduce Corani’s value.'°”

683. FTI was not inconsistent in using the more reliable and precise DCF method to determine the FMV
of Santa Ana on the one hand, and then using the change in Claimant’s share price to estimate the
permanent damage to Corani caused by the alleged breaches on the other. Since the alleged wrongful
actions themselves have caused the uncertainty that forced FTI to use a less precise approach to
measure the damages to Corani, it would not be proper to ignore the permanent and ongoing damages

to Corani merely due to the inherent difficulties in estimating its quantum. !°*

684. RPA’s conclusion that the Corani Feasibility Study work was thorough and diligent remains
unchanged. Corani is one of the ten largest silver deposits in the world and it is beyond doubt that it
is a world-class mining project. While the valuation date for expropriation of Santa Ana is June 23,
2011, there is no requirement under the FTA that damages must have the same valuation date. The
2015 Final Feasibility Study demonstrates that the information that existed in 2011 is and was valid.
Contrary to SRK’s statement, the 2011 Feasibility Study incorporated allowances for Corani’s remote

location and altitude. The projected metallurgical recoveries contained in the 2011 Feasibility Study

are not overstated. Claimant has completed work to support silver recovery estimates at 70%, rather
than 55% as SRK asserts. SRK’s claims with regard to scheduling and construction are speculative
and without warrant, especially since Corani’s Project schedule of 17 months from ESIA preparation

and permitting is five months longer than the 12 months suggested by SRK.'°

2. Respondent’s Arguments

685. Throughout, Claimant’s request for Corani damages has been a “throw away” claim, designed to
inflate damages in the hopes that the Tribunal would split the difference and arrive at a higher
midpoint.'*° Claimant’s claim for Corani damages rests on the assumption that the Santa Ana
measure reduced Corani’s market value in three ways: (1) by increasing financing costs by requiring
Claimant to obtain more outside investment, (2) by delaying development of Corani, and (3) by
increasing the market’s perception of risk associated with the Corani Project.'°!! Claimant’s Corani
claim must fail because Claimant cannot prove the fundamental elements of its claim — i.e., (1) that
it suffered enduring harm to its Corani investment and (2) that a sufficiently direct and proximate link
exists between the measures Respondent took vis-d-vis Santa Ana and the alleged Corani damages. '°'?

686. Claimant’s entire case for the existence of damages to Corani rests on an insufficient factual
foundation: Mr. Swarthout’s self-serving witness testimony — testimony that is contradicted by Mr.

1013

Swarthout’s contemporaneous statements. The key tenants of Mr. Swarthout’s uncorroborated

testimony are that Respondent’s actions regarding Santa Ana (1) made it difficult for Claimant to

finance Corani, (2) delayed development of Corani, and (3) increased investor’s perception of risk

regarding Corani. First, if these allegations were true, one would expect additional supporting,
substantiating documentation would have been submitted. Mr. Swarthout was and remains obligated
under Canadian securities regulations to disclose material information to investors — including any
negative impact that Supreme Decree 032 might have had on the Corani Project.''* Although it

would have been in Claimant’s interest to submit such documentation, none has been provided.'°'%

 

Second, from June 2011 - September 2015, Mr. Swarthout made repeated public statements that
contradict his witness testimony. He repeated that Santa Ana events had not interfered with Corani’s
advancement or timeline. Either Mr. Swarthout and Claimant violated Canadian securities
regulations by hiding massive Corani-related losses in 2011, or they are asserting baseless claims
before this Tribunal. The Tribunal cannot put any faith in Mr. Swarthout’s credibility in the face of
this inconsistency. '°!°
687. Further, even if the Tribunal were to accept his testimony, issues that relate only to Claimant — like
difficulties financing the Corani Project — cannot decrease the FMV of Corani.'°'7 Markets value an
asset at its most profitable use in the hands of the most efficient owner.'°'* If Claimant faced
financing difficulties at Corani, this would not lower Corani’s market value if another mining
company could have bought and developed the site without these financial problems. Brattle explains
that a robust market exists for mining properties similar to Corani. Claimant can, therefore, mitigate
any financing-related damages by selling Corani at fair market price to a buyer who is able to finance
the Project. After all, if Corani indeed lost value because of Claimant’s inability to finance Corani in

light of its Santa Ana experience, it would be within Claimant’s fiduciary duty to its shareholders to

sell the asset for its FMV.'°'? Contrary to Claimant’s mitigation argument, the FTA does not
compensate in accordance with an investor’s alleged “intentions” and “strategies” — it provides

compensation in accordance with losses in market value, which do not turn on one owner’s plans. '°7°

688. Contrary to Claimant’s argument, Corani would not be sold at a “fire sale”, depressed price.'?! As
Brattle notes and FTI overlooks, a forced sale occurs when the seller has no time to adequately assess
the market. Here, Claimant has had adequate liquidity to conduct business for more than four years
since the issuance of Supreme Decree 032, during which time it has continued to develop Corani and
during which time it would have had sufficient opportunity to conduct an orderly and value-
maximizing sale.'°7?

689. Claimant’s Corani claim fails because Claimant has not proven that Respondent’s actions regarding
Santa Ana caused any lasting damage to Corani’s market value or an increased perception of market

risk, 1023

As the tribunal in Rompetrol v. Romania observed, the purpose of a damages award is to
“make good in monetary terms some enduring alteration for the worse in the economic, financial or
commercial position of the foreign investor which can be traced, in a sufficiently direct and proximate
way, to the host State’s unlawful course of action.”'°* Here, Claimant has not proven any enduring
harm. Claimant’s decline in stock price in the wake of Supreme Decree 032 was nothing more than
a temporary dip, after which Claimant’s share price quickly rebounded. This quick rebound makes
sense, given that Respondent enacted Supreme Decree 032 for reasons inapplicable to Corani, which
was not the target of violent protests and had not been illegally acquired.'°> Claimant asks that the
Tribunal consider Claimant’ s low share price of today as being caused by Claimant’s depressed share
price immediately following Supreme Decree 032. Claimant ignores the five years of history

occurring in between — in particular, that Claimant’s share price was higher on July 21, 2011 than it

argument, Claimant would be paying Respondent for its “good fortune” caused by Supreme Decree
032, 1026

690. Brattle explains that the true driver of the poor performance of Claimant’s stock price was the general
downturn in the global mining sector.'°”’ An additional factor affecting Claimant’s stock price may
be the market’s perception of risks to the viability of the Corani Project. Brattle explains that it may
not even be possible to produce lead and zinc ore at Corani that is sufficiently concentrated to undergo
metallurgical processing. Without marketable lead and zinc concentrates at Corani, it will not be
possible to produce silver at Corani, as the latter depends on the former.'°7* Claimant failed to resolve
this issue — it told the market in 2009 and 2011 that the risk existed and could only be eliminated by
successful metallurgical testing, but then Claimant declined to conduct those tests in the following 4
years or even in its 2015 Updated Feasibility Study. The market likely anticipates that Claimant
expects that the results would be negative. Thus, the market is aware of the unresolved, fundamental
risk to the Corani Project’s viability and has discounted Claimant’s stock price accordingly. This
tribunal should decline Claimant’s invitation to hold Respondent liable for deteriorating market

conditions in the global metals sector or the market’s declining confidence in Corani’s technical

1030

 

feasibility.

691. Claimant’s Corani claim also fails because Claimant has not proven that the actions regarding Santa

Ana were direct and proximate causes of its alleged Corani damages. '°*! Claimant does not deny that

it carries the burden of proof on causation, but instead cites a string of inapposite cases that do not
address the situation where, as here, claimant requested and received damages for one project and for
an entirely separate, second endeavor.'” In Sedco v. NIOC, that tribunal awarded income related to
the expropriated asset — not damages from the allegedly expropriated asset and a separate, second

asset, as Claimant proposes here. !°%

Likewise, in Claimant’s Suez v. Argentina, the tribunal only
awarded damages related to the asset that was directly impacted by the measures.'°“ In Inmaris v.
Ukraine, the tribunal’s ruling was a statement in the obvious: impounding a company’s only asset
causes that company to go bankrupt. That claimant was not requesting damages related to a separate

project and, thus, the case is not helpful to Claimant. !°

Finally, Claimant cites Lemire v. Ukraine,
where the tribunal held that if the tendering process had been proper, claimant would have received
certain radio frequencies, enabling claimant to create successful radio stations. In order for Lemire
to be helpful to Claimant, the tribunal would have had to have awarded claimant damages for
additional radio stations that claimant might have hoped to develop using the profits from the
successful operation of the initial stations. Lemire, accordingly, does not advance Claimant's case.!°°
692. Metalclad v. Argentina is comparable to the present case. There, claimant sought FMV of the asset
directly impacted by the measures at issue, as well as additional damages for supposed impacts to its
other business ventures. The Metalclad tribunal rejected the additional damages claim, holding that
the causal relationship between breach and damage was too remote.'°*” Likewise, the Corani claim
turns on an allegedly causal relationship that, by any objective measure, is remote and uncertain. The
Tribunal should accept the wisdom of the Meralclad tribunal and reject Claimant’s Corani damages

claim. '°*

693. Claimant’s quantum analysis of Corani damages is inflated and internally inconsistent.'°° Even if
Claimant could have used Santa Ana cash flows to pay part of the US$ 574 million up-front capital
costs, the Santa Ana cash flows could have covered only a fraction of those expenses. If one assumes
that Claimant was able to generate all of the free cash flows it projected for Santa Ana, and that
Claimant devoted all of that free cash to Corani, it would take more than 8 years of operations at

Santa Ana to finance Corani’

 

tial capital needs. Thus, Claimant would have nonetheless needed

to attract substantial outside funding to develop Corani.'“° Supreme Decree 032 enabled Claimant

to avoid spending US$ 71 million in construction costs, as it did not build the Santa Ana mine. This
amount exceeds the free cash flow that Claimant projected from the first year of production at Santa

Ana, freeing those funds to be deployed at Corani. Brattle notes that the majority of the US$ 71

million has been used by Claimant for purposes other than Santa Ana and that thus, contrary to Mr.

Swarthout’s statement, the terms of the equity offering did not prevent Claimant from using the

proceeds for other purposes, such as advancing Corani.'™!

694. Brattle explains that it is not more costly to finance a project with outside funds than with internal
funds. To argue otherwise conflicts with basis economic principles — while borrowing has explicit
costs, using internal funds is also costly because of opportunity costs.!°

695. Since Claimant has failed to prove causation, Respondent has not addressed Claimant’s Corani
damages calculation in depth.!“* There is, however, one glaring inconsistency in FTI’s valuation
approaches: FTI adopts a stock-market based method for valuing the alleged damages to Corani, in
direct contradiction with its methodology for valuing Santa Ana. There, “FTI refises to calibrate its
DCF results to align them with reality, i.e., the actual market value of Santa Ana as reflected in Bear
Creek’s share price.” FTI discredits the value of share price data when applied to Santa Ana and at

one point even states that the “share price does not provide a reliable measure of the FMV of either

Santa Ana or Corani.” Yet, FTI bases its US$ 170 million Corani damages estimate entirely on

changes in share price.'** This inconsistency has not yet been resolved.

FTI has estimated the Corani damages to range from US$ 59.6 million to US$ 267.3 million. First,
FTI took Claimant’s enterprise value on May 27, 2011 and subtracts the market value of Santa Ana
(calculated in 3 different ways), to arrive at the remainder as an estimated market value for Corani as
of May 27, 2011. Second, FTI project this estimated value forward to June 27, 2011 using a stock
market index to arrive at the estimated “but for” value of Corani on June 27, 2011. Third, FTI
subtracts from this “but for” number the actual value of Claimant on June 27, 2011 — which in theory
no longer included Santa Ana — to arrive at the loss of value for Corani.'* The key error and internal
inconsistency lies in the first step of this analysis. Applying a higher value for Santa Ana yields a
lower valuation and lower potential damages for Corani, and vice versa. When Claimant applies its
preferred US$ 224.2 million Santa Ana DCF valuation to its Corani damages calculation, it reaches
an estimated value for Corani of US$ 59.2 million.'“° When Claimant uses analysis reports that
suggest that Santa Ana only accounted for 19.2 % of Claimant’s total enterprise value, it arrives at
figures valuing Santa Ana at US$ 104.3 million — half of FTI’s estimate based on its DCF calculations
— and tripling the Corani damages estimate to US$ 170.6 million.'°" FTI further suggested that the
market may have considered that Santa Ana had zero value — thereby producing a damages estimate
for Corani of US$ 267.3 million — a number that is five times higher than FTI’s estimate for Corani

when applying its own Santa Ana valuation.!°*

In its closing argument, Respondent pointed out that Claimant introduced new testimony at the
Hearing. Confronted with the fact that Claimant had never disclosed to the market that it suffered
losses at Corani, Mr. Swarthout claimed that he told unnamed stock analysts during an undated phone
call that actions at Santa Ana harmed Corani. If it was true that this connection was felt at the time,

surely the Tribunal would have learned of this phone call prior to the Hearing. '“?

3. The Tribunal’s Reasoning

698. As is undisputed, Claimant has the burden of proving not only the alleged damages to the Corani

Project, but also for the requisite causal link between Respondent’s breach of the FTA regarding the

Santa Ana Project and the alleged damages to the Corani Project.

699. In this regard, Claimant argues that in the present case the following two steps provide the required

chain of causation:

a) As a consequence of Peru’s expropriation of Santa Ana, Claimant has to raise more
money at a higher financing rate, while having fewer options than if it retained
control of the Santa Ana project; the Corani project has become riskier to develop;
and the development of Corani has been delayed, leading to a permanent loss of
income for the period of delay;

b) These events caused a direct, normal and foreseeable financial loss to Bear Creek
measured by FTI as the decrease in Bear Creek’s enterprise value between the last
trading day prior to the ESIA suspension and the first trading day after the
expropriation’s announcement. '°°

700. Respondent denies such causal link and points out that Brattle explains that the true driver of the poor

performance of Claimant’s stock price was the general downturn in the global mining sector, and that
an additional factor affecting Claimant’s stock price may be the market’s perception of risks to the

viability of the Corani Project. !°!

701. In the evidence before it, the Tribunal takes note of several aspects of the conduct of Claimant by

reference to the testimony of its witness, Mr. Swarthout:

1) In 2011, Mr. Swarthout and Claimant, in its Interim Financial Statement and its
Annual Report, did not include or otherwise inform its investors regarding any loss
in the Corani Project due to what happened to its Santa Ana Project. !°

705.

2) After protests subsided on June 27, 2011, Mr. Swarthout indicated that he did not

see the Corani Project as being affected by the protests or the governmental
1053

measures.

3) In his 2™ Witness Statement, Mr. Swarthout testifies that clearly there were
significant losses in the Corani Project due to what happened to the Santa Ana
Project.!04

4) In reply to a question regarding the fact that Claimant had not disclosed to the

market that it suffered losses at Corani, Mr. Swarthout claimed that he told
unnamed stock analysts during an undated phone call that actions at Santa Ana
harmed Corani.'°
The Tribunal considers Mr. Swarthout’s testimony to be contradictory and not providing adequate
proof of causation for any losses in the Corani Project due to Respondent’s breach of the FTA with

regard to the Santa Ana Project.

Further, the Tribunal has been unable to find any compelling evidence before it in the FTI expert
reports as regards the required causation. Therefore, there is no need to examine the submissions by

Claimant or FTI regarding the quantification of any loss to the Corani Project.

Since Claimant has failed to provide sufficient proof of causation of any losses in the Corani Project
due to Respondent’s breach of the FTA with regard to the Santa Ana Project, the Tribunal concludes

that the claim must be dismissed.

INTEREST
A. CLAIMANT’S ARGUMENTS

Claimant requests an award of post-award interest, until the date Respondent pays in full, at the
highest possible lawful rate, such as Respondent’s borrowing rate. Respondent’s failure to pay

compensation to Claimant is effectively a loan to Respondent. Hence, Claimant should be

compensated like any other lender to Respondent during this period and should receive interest at a

rate equivalent to Respondent’s external cost of debt financing from private lenders. '°°°

706. International law — as confirmed by decisions of investment arbitration tribunals — recognizes that
compound interest is the generally accepted standard in international investment arbitrations. '°%7
Several reasons have been suggested for requiring an award of compound interest, including that it

aids in making the injured claimant whole, prevents unjust enrichment, and promotes and

efficiency. !°*

707. The Parties do not dispute that Claimant is entitled to compound interest on any amounts awarded.

The Parties dispute the rate at which such interest would be calculated.'°°

The FTA requires that interest be based on a commercial rate.'!° Thus, the Tribunal should reject
Respondent’s argument that interest should be at the borrowing rate of 0.65% or the risk-free rate of
0.16%, because neither is commercial. The risk-free rate is not a commercial rate because Respondent
could not borrow and Claimant would not lend at that rate.'°' Respondent’s proposed borrowing
rate — derived from adding to the interest rate on a one-month US Treasury bill to the sovereign spread
on Peruvian certificates of deposit with a one-year maturity — does not accurately represent

1062 The Peruvian Ministry of Economics and Finance calculates the

Respondent's cost of borrowing.
country’s emerging market bond index spread to be 2.0% and its coupon rates and bond rates on US$-
denominated debt were 9.9% and 6.0%, respectively.!°°* FTI, however, concludes that Respondent’ s
likely borrowing rate was in the range of 5.1% (the weighted yield to maturity at the expropriation
date) and 5.6% (the coupon rate of the most recently issued bond). Accordingly, the Tribunal should

reject Brattle’s proposed rate of 0.65% and adopt FTI’s conservative rate of 5%.!°

Based on the DCF calculation, the Santa Ana Project has a FMV of US$ 224.2 million on the
valuation date, before interest. With pre-award interest of US$ 72.4 million calculated at 5.0% per
annum, compounded annually up to an estimated date of award (March 15, 2017), the FMV of Santa
Ana is US$ 296.2 million.'°%

B. RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS

In principle, Respondent agrees with Claimant that the appropriate interest rate is “a rate equivalent
to Peru’s external cost of debt financing from private lenders.” '°®° Brattle has calculated the
appropriate interest rate using the average spread for Respondent’s sovereign credit default swaps,

plus a risk-free rate adjustment. Using this, Brattle arrived at an interest rate of 0.72% annually. !°7

Claimant initially applied a rate of 5%, the interest rate for domestic court judgments, as the

1068

appropriate rate of interest in this case. In its later submission, Claimant argued that its 5% rate is

correct because it is a reflection of Claimant’s cost of borrowing.'° Claimant’s proposed 5% rate,
however, is not equivalent to and is in no way indicative of Respondent’s external cost of debt.!°”
Using Claimant’s cost of borrowing is inconsistent with Claimant’s theory of interest (which is based
on Respondent’s cost of borrowing) and with Claimant’s instruction to FTI to use a Peruvian Central

Bank reference rate. '°""

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONING

Article 812.3 of the FTA provides: “Compensation shall be paid without delay and shall be fully
realizable and freely transferable. Compensation shall be payable in a freely convertible currency
and shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of

expropriation until date of payment.”

Respondent agrees with Claimant that the appropriate commercially reasonable interest rate is “a rate

equivalent to Peru’s external cost of debt financing from private lenders.” \°”

However, the Parties disagree regarding the calculation of this rate. The Tribunal is not persuaded
by Respondent’s argument that interest should be at the borrowing rate of 0.65% per annum or the
risk-free rate of 0.16% per annum. Neither of these rates are commercial, because Respondent could
not borrow and Claimant would not lend at that rate. Claimant correctly points out that the Peruvian
Ministry of Economics and Finance calculates the country’s emerging market bond index spread to
be 2.0% per annum and its coupon rates and bond rates on US$-denominated debt were 9.9% and

1073

6.0% per annum, respectively. FTI, however, concludes that Respondent’s likely borrowing rate

was in the range of 5.1% (the weighted yield to maturity at the expropriation date) and 5.6% (the

1074 5

FTI’s conservative rate of 5% per annum'®”* is most appropriate in the present case.

715. The Tribunal also accepts that compound interest is generally accepted in the practice of investment

arbitration for any damages awarded. '°”°

716. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that, on the amount of damages awarded, compound interest at a
rate of 5% per annum, compounding quarterly, is to be paid by Respondent from the date that

Supreme Decree 032 was published, i.e. June 25, 2011, until date of payment.

XII. COSTS

717. Since the filing of their costs submissions, ICSID has requested further deposits from the Parties, and
these increase the Parties’ costs. The total costs deposits requested by ICSID amount to US$
1,249,925.00. Of these, the final calculation of the total of the arbitration costs amount to US$
1,122,460.54.

A. CLAIMANT’S ARGUMENTS

718. Claimant requests that the Tribunal award it all of its costs and expenses associated with this
arbitration, including attorneys’ fees. But for Respondent’s breach of its obligations under the FTA,
Claimant would not have incurred these arbitration costs. Thus, in order to place Claimant in the

same position it would have been in the absence of Respondent’s breaches, Claimant should be

awarded all costs, expenses, and attorneys’ fees incurred herein. !°°

Claimant’s costs and expenses are high in several respects, which confirms the inappropriateness of
requiring Respondent to pay them. For example, Claimant’s international counsel ran up additional
fees and expenses that exceeded those of Respondent by more than US$ 2.2 million. In addition,
Claimant paid its local Peruvian counsel three times as much as did Respondent. Claimant should

not be permitted to look to Respondent to mitigate its own overspending.'°*”

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONING

The FTA provides in Article 841.1: “Where a Tribunal makes a final award against the disputing
Party, the Tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only: [...] The Tribunal may also

award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.”

The applicable arbitration rules are Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1)(j) of the

ICSID Arbitration Rules. They allow the Tribunal a degree of discretion. !°

The Tribunal will first address the question of how the arbitration costs shall be apportioned between
the Parties, because the evaluation of the amounts claimed by a party will only be relevant insofar as

the Tribunal finds that a party has to reimburse to the other party some of the costs that party incurred.

In this context, the Tribunal takes into account the following. While Claimant lost its request for
provisional measures, Claimant has prevailed regarding jurisdiction, liability, and damages in the sum

of US$ 18,237,592. Claimant, however, had claimed damages of an amount of “at least US$ 522.2

734,

million.” Thus, it only prevailed regarding about 3% of its total claim by value. However, regarding
the arbitration costs involved, it has to be noted that this considerable difference is only due to two
factors: (1) with respect to the Santa Ana Claim, the Tribunal has not accepted the DCF method of
calculation, and (2) the Corani Claim has been dismissed in its entirety. As the submissions of the
Parties, the conduct of the hearing, and this Award show, these two issues caused only a very small
portion of the work, costs, and time for the Parties and the Tribunal in this procedure. The vast
majority of the arbitration costs were caused by the issues on which Respondent did not prevail, and
in particular the violation of the FTA by the circumstances in which Supreme Decree 032 was

adopted.

In view of the above considerations, using its discretion for cost decisions in awarding costs, the
Tribunal considers that Respondent should bear its own costs and reimburse Claimant for 75% of the

reasonable costs it incurred.

Now, the Tribunal will address the question whether or to which extent the arbitration costs claimed

by Claimant must be considered reasonable.
In this regard, Respondent, in its 2"! Cost Submission, has argued as follows:

Respondent also notes that Claimant's costs and expenses are high in several respects that
would confirm the inappropriateness of requiring Respondent to pay any portion of them.
While Claimant (properly) claims only the portion of its international counsel's fees
actually paid by the company ($4.5 million), Claimant's international counsel apparently
ran up actual fees and expenses that exceeded those of Respondent by more than $2.2
million. Likewise, Claimant paid its local Peruvian counsel some three times as much as
did Respondent. Claimant should not be permitted to look to Respondent to mitigate its own
overspending. [internal footnotes omitted]

The Tribunal is not persuaded by these objections. The higher fees and expenses for Claimant’s
international counsel are not unreasonable, in particular since they had to research and deal with the
factual and legal situations of considerable complexity, while Respondent could provide its counsel
with such information by using its own resources in its own country. For the same reason, it is

understandable that Claimant had to rely to a greater extent on and pay more for its Peruvian counsel.

ICSID ARB/14/21 275

1089

Further, as Claimant points ou it drafted and submitted two more memorials, i.e. the Request for

Arbitration and the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, that Respondent did not need to prepare.

735. The Tribunal therefore considers that the arbitration costs claimed by Claimant are reasonable for the

case at hand.

736. In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Respondent has to bear its own costs of arbitration, and has to

reimburse 75% of the arbitration costs requested by Claimant, i.e. US$ 5,986,183.29.

737. The rate of interest found above to be applicable for the damages awarded also has to be applied to
this payment for arbitration costs, however only from the date this amount is due, i.e. from the date

of this Award.

In the arbitration proceeding between

BEAR CREEK MINING CORPORATION

Claimant

and

REPUBLIC OF PERU

Respondent

(ICSID Case No. ARB/14/21)

PARTIAL DISSENTING OPINION
PROFESSOR PHILIPPE SANDS QC

. Incertain respects this might be described as a straightforward case. An investor — the Claimant,
Bear Creek Mining Corporation — decided that it wished to mine silver ore deposits located in
an area of Peru known as Santa Ana in the Puno department. In accordance with Article 71 of
the Peruvian Constitution, this location, which is within 50 kilometres of the border between
Peru and Bolivia, meant that the Claimant was obliged to obtain — along with a multitude of
other permitting requirements — a “public necessity” Decree granted to it by the Peruvian
Council of Ministers. In November 2007, the Council of Ministers proceeded to adopt Supreme
Decree 083-2007, declaring the Santa Ana Project to be a public necessity. This authorised the

Claimant to acquire seven mining rights in the Santa Ana area of Puno. Three years and six

1

months later, in June 2011, the Council of Ministers adopted Supreme Decree 032-2011-EM.
This revoked Supreme Decree 083-2007 and the finding of “public necessity”, ending the
Claimant’s right to operate its Santa Ana concessions. In between those two dates - November
2007 and June 2011 — there were protests and considerable social unrest in the Puno
department. As set out below, I am clear that the protests and unrests were caused in part by

the Santa Ana Project.

2. Iam very largely in agreement with the conclusions of the Tribunal, to the effect that, within
the meaning of the Free Trade Agreement between Canada and Peru (FTA): the Claimant made
an investment; the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claim; and there is no bar to the exercise
by the Tribunal of such jurisdiction (admissibility). I also agree with the conclusion that the
effect of Supreme Decree 032-2011 was to expropriate by indirect means the right of the
Claimant to operate the Santa Ana concessions, and that this occurred in violation of Article
812 of the FTA. In my view, the circumstances which the Peruvian government faced — massive
and growing social unrest caused in part by the Santa Ana Project — left it with no option but
to act in some way to protect the well-being of its citizens; however, other and less draconian
options were available to the Council of Ministers, including the suspension of Decree 083-
2007, rather than revocation. There is no evidence before the Tribunal that these other options
were explored or assessed, properly or even at all. The circumstances in which Supreme Decree
032-2011 was adopted — in particular the failure to give the Claimant a right to be heard before
its adoption — also gave rise, in my view, to a violation of Article 805, being a violation of the
obligation to offer “fair and equitable treatment”. I understand, however, the Tribunal’s
conclusion that “the Parties have not presented arguments related to the legal consequences of
such a finding, and such a finding indeed would not change or add to those that follow from an

unlawful indirect expropriation”

3. TIalso agree with the Majority that the consequence of the violation of Article 812 of the FTA
entitles the Claimant to be awarded a measure of compensation, and with the general approach
taken to the assessment of that compensation. In particular, I fully concur — given the Project’s

speculative and unlikely prospects in face of serious social unrest, the manifest failure to obtain

Award, para. 533.

a “social license”, and the many environmental and other regulatory authorisations yet to be
obtained — with the conclusion set out in the Award that “the calculation of Claimant's damages
in the present case cannot be carried out by reference to the potential expected profitability of
the Santa Ana Project and the DCF method”.* In the circumstances, the proper measure of
damages is to be assessed by reference to the Claimant’s actual investment in the Project after

November 27, 2007.°

4. Idisagree, however, with the Majority’s assessment of the amount of damages that are due, in
application of this approach, and in particular the failure to reduce that amount by reason of the
fault of the Claimant in contributing to the unrest.* Whilst I agree that it is for the Respondent
to establish any contributory fault, my assessment of the evidence before the Tribunal is that
the Respondent has clearly established the Claimant’s contributory responsibility, by reason of
its acts and omissions, to the social unrest that left the Peruvian government in the predicament
it faced, and the need to do something reasonable and lawful to protect public well-being. I set

out my reasons in this Partial Dissent.

5. A central issue in the facts argued before the Tribunal concerned the circumstances of the
collapse of the Santa Ana Project — a matter of fact — and the legal standard to be applied — a
matter of law. As to the latter, as noted by the Tribunal, the Abengoa award offers the legal
standard to be applied. On this approach, the Tribunal is called on to assess whether “events
that led to the loss of the Claimants’ investment would not have occurred” if “a social
communication program had been timely implemented” .> | am not persuaded by the conclusion
reached at paragraph 411 of the Award in this case. On the basis of the evidence before us I
have difficulty in understanding how it could be concluded, as the Majority does, that there was
no connection — or partially causal relationship — between the manner in which the Claimant
conducted itself and the circumstances that gave rise, firstly, to the disruption of the Santa Ana

Project, and then to its premature demise as a consequence of Supreme Decree 032- 2011.

2 Award, para. 604.

> Claimant invested a total of US$ 21,827,687. However, as part of this investment occurred before Claimant legally
obtained the concessions on 27 November 2007, when Supreme Decree 083 was issued. The final amount thus invested
by Claimant equals US$ 18,237,592. See Award, paras. 658 ff.

Award (18 April 2013).

In reaching a contrary view to my colleagues, I rely on the totality of the evidence that was put
before us by the Parties, and in particular the extensive testimony of numerous witnesses and
experts. For the reasons set out below, in my view this evidence clearly shows that the
Claimant’s acts and omissions, in the period before 2008, during 2008, thereafter, and right up
until May 2011, contributed in material ways to the events that unfolded and then led to the
Project’s collapse. In particular, the Project collapsed because of the investor’s inability to
obtain a “social license”, the necessary understanding between the Project’s proponents and
those living in the communities most likely to be affected by it, whether directly or indirectly.
It is blindingly obvious that the viability and success of a project such as this, located in the
community of the Aymara peoples, a group of interconnected communities, was necessarily
dependent on local support. In this regard, the Project can hardly be said to have got off to a
good start, with the Claimant making use of a degree of subterfuge, by obtaining permits in the
name of one of its own lowly employees — Ms Villavicencio, a Peruvian national — which it, as
a foreign corporation, was not at the time authorised or lawfully entitled to obtain. If nothing
else, the absence of transparency at that early stage of the Project can only have contributed to
an undermining of the conditions necessary to build trust over the longer term. The discontent

that followed, expressed by many members of the affected local communities, was foreseeable.

In this regard it is helpful that the Parties broadly agree that the investment was made in an area
in which the rights of numerous indigenous communities — under national and international law
— were fully engaged. Of particular relevance are the rules set forth in ILO Convention 169
(Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention), which was applicable to the territory of Peru after
it became a Party on February 2"4, 1994. The Preamble to the Convention, which was adopted
in 1989, recognizes “the aspirations of [indigenous and tribal] peoples to exercise control over
their own institutions, ways of life and economic development and to maintain and develop
their identities, languages and religions, within the framework of the States in which they live”,
and calls attention to “the distinctive contributions of indigenous and tribal peoples to the
cultural diversity and social and ecological harmony of humankind and to international co-
operation and understanding”. This preambular language offers encouragement to any investor
to take into account as fully as possible the aspirations of indigenous and tribal peoples.

Establishing conditions of transparency and trust are a vital pre-requisite for the success of a

4

project, which involves a corporation arriving from a faraway place to pursue an investment in

the lands of indigenous and tribal peoples.

8. Article 1 provides that the Convention “applies to” certain “tribal peoples” and “peoples ...
who are regarded as indigenous”. There can be no doubt that it is applicable to the Aymara
peoples in respect of the activities proposed by the Santa Ana Project. No serious argument to

the contrary was made.

9. Article 13(1) of the Convention provides that:

“In applying the provisions of this Part of the Convention governments shall respect the
special importance for the cultures and spiritual values of the peoples concerned of their
relationship with the lands or territories, or both as applicable, which they occupy or
otherwise use, and in particular the collective aspects of this relationship.”

Article 15 then provides:
“1. The rights of the peoples concerned to the natural resources pertaining to their lands
shall be specially safeguarded. These rights include the right of these peoples to participate
in the use, management and conservation of these resources.
2. In cases in which the State retains the ownership of mineral or sub-surface resources or
rights to other resources pertaining to lands, governments shall establish or maintain
procedures through which they shall consult these peoples, with a view to ascertaining
whether and to what degree their interests would be prejudiced, before undertaking or
permitting any programmes for the exploration or exploitation of such resources pertaining
to their lands. The peoples concerned shall wherever possible participate in the benefits of
such activities, and shall receive fair compensation for any damages which they may
sustain as a result of such activities.”

As noted, there is no dispute between the Parties that the Convention is applicable to the

indigenous peoples situated in the area of the Santa Ana Project.° It is the case, of course, that

the obligation to implement the Convention is one that falls on States,’ by implementing the

Convention through national laws. In the case of Peru, ILO Convention 169 was approved and

implemented in 1993 through Legislative Resolution No. 26253.

. Yet the fact that the Convention may not impose obligations directly on a private foreign

investor as such does not, however, mean that it is without significance or legal effects for
them. In Urbaser v Argentina, the Tribunal noted that human rights relating to dignity and
adequate housing and living conditions “are complemented by an obligation on all parts, public
and private parties, not to engage in activity aimed at destroying such rights.”* The Urbaser
Tribunal further noted that the BIT being applied in that case “has to be construed in harmony
with other rules of international law of which it forms part, including those relating to human
rights”,? and that Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention together with the governing law clause
of that BIT (Article X(5)) provided that that “Tribunal shall apply the law of the host State

“and such rules of international law as may be applicable.” '°

. The same considerations apply in the present case in relation to the requirements of ILO

Convention 169, and in particular its Article 15 on consultation requirements. Article 837 of
the Canada Peru FTA, on Governing Law, provides that this Tribunal “shall decide the issues
in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law”. ILO
Convention 169 is a rule of international law applicable to the territory of Peru. This Tribunal
is entitled to take the Convention into account in determining whether the Claimant carried out
its obligation to give effect to the aspirations of the Aymara peoples in an appropriate manner,
having regard to all relevant legal requirements, including the implementing Peruvian

legislation.

. The relevance and applicability of Convention 169 was accepted by the Respondent.'! As for

the Claimant, its Chief Operation Officer, Mr Elsiario Antunez de Mayolo, testified that the

Convention was “mentioned ... as part of the Environmental Impact Assessment and also with

the consultants.”

Counsel for the Claimant accepted that the Convention had been
“incorporated into” domestic law, including the right of the indigenous peoples to consultation
under the Convention. !* Whether by means of the domestic law of Peru or otherwise, the
relevance of the Convention has been recognised by both Parties. Yet when I asked Mr Antunez
de Mayolo whether he was familiar with what Article 15 of the Convention said, or had ever
seen it, he replied: “noo '4 This, in my view, indicates that the Claimant had, at best, a semi-
detached relationship to the vital rights set forth in this part of the Convention. It was not as

fully prepared for the making of an investment in the lands of the communities of indigenous

peoples — the peoples concerned by the project it was embarked upon — as it should have been.

13. Article 15 recognises various rights “of the peoples concerned”. These rights include: (1) to
“participate in the use, management and conservation” of resources “pertaining to their
lands”; (2) to be consulted “with a view to ascertaining whether and to what degree their
interests would be prejudiced, before undertaking or permitting any programmes for the
exploration or exploitation of such resources pertaining to their lands”; and (3) “wherever
possible [to] participate in the benefits of such activities, and [to] receive fair compensation
for any damages which they may sustain as a result of such activities.” It is noteworthy that the
Convention connects the right to be consulted with the right to participate in the benefits. It
also to be noted that when Article 15 refers to “these peoples” it means all of “the peoples

concerned”, not just some of them.

14. The question therefore arises whether the rights of all “the peoples concerned” by the Santa
Ana Project were given sufficient effect, as required by the Convention and the implementing
domestic law. That raises, as a first issue, who “the peoples concerned” were, and as a second
step, whether the rights of all these peoples, including in particular the right to be consulted,

were given sufficient recognition.

15. The evidence before us included a map contained in the Claimant’s Environmental Impact
Assessment (EIA). This showed, within a continuous line marked on the map, the geographic

area to be exploited under the Project, and the area directly affected.'>

16. The map identifies a number of communities originally believed by the Claimant to fall within
the Project’s area of direct influence. These might be said to be “the peoples concerned”. These
communities ethnically and culturally belong to the Aymara group. They are indigenous
peoples, who mostly engage in “agriculture, small-scale fishing and livestock farming”,'®
activities that are closely connected to the land they inhabit. Moreover, for them this land “is
not only a geographical space but represents a spiritual bond for the communities’, including
as “the ‘guardian mountains’ [Apus], which represent extremely important spiritual

sanctuaries for all the population in the area.”""

17. During the written pleadings, this map was modified by the Respondent to mark in green all
those communities that had members employed by Claimant in one of its rotational work
programmes. The members of other communities were not involved in any form of employment
scheme related to the Santa Ana Project. These communities, said to be opposed to the Santa

Ana Project, were marked in red on this map.'®

18. It is apparent that the total number of communities marked in red is significant. These
communities are not only amongst those that might be affected — whether directly or indirectly
— by certain negative aspects of the Project, but also those that would not benefit from it in
economic terms. The map appears to show that different communities were treated in a different
way, and that all groups within Claimant’s own identified area of influence — whether direct or

indirect — were not treated in the same manner.

19. There was ample evidence before the Tribunal that the communities who began to protest in
2008 (and in later years, including 2011) tended to be those marked in red on this second map.
This suggests a correlation between the two factors, and would appear to offer a possible
explanation for the adverse responses — of certain communities — to the Santa Ana Project, and
the role of the Claimant. The fact that Claimant did not — on the evidence before the Tribunal
— take real or sufficient steps to address those concerns and grievances, and to engage the trust
of all potentially affected communities, appears to have contributed, at least in part, to some of
the population’s general discontent with the Santa Ana Project, ultimately crystallising in the
spring 2011 protests. The evidence before the Tribunal shows that the Claimant was put on
notice as early as 2008 that numerous communities (marked in red) had strong objections, yet
the evidence before the Tribunal made clear — to me at least — that it failed to take active — or,

in some instances, any — steps to address the concerns of those communities.

20. One of the expert witnesses who appeared before the Tribunal, on behalf of the Respondent,
was Professor Antonio Alfonso Pefia Jumpa. He is a Professor at the Pontificia University of
Peru. He holds degrees in law and in anthropology, including a doctorate from Leuven
University in Belgium. He provided a clear summary of his two expert reports, and was then
cross-examined by the Claimant. I found him to be an expert witness of obvious independence,
who was persuasive and credible. No one of equivalent weight was put up against him. His
testimony was clear, understated, balanced, focused and — in respect of its impact on me —

significant.

21. Shown a copy of the map showing the communities marked in red and green, Professor Pefia
Jumpa told the Tribunal that the communities and parcialidad shown in green squares were

“beneficiaries” of the Santa Ana Project (Challacollo, Huacullani, Ingenio, Ancomarca and

12

Condor Ancocahua),'® in the sense that they got jobs from it. He added that “/t/he others, ones
in red, can also be identified as communities or parcialidades”. They included Yorohoco,
Arconuma, Churhuanua, Totoroma, Sacacani, Carique Challacollo and San Juan (connected
with another community), and all of these were “communities or parcialidades that are part of
the zone” affected by the Project.” Despite being, as he put it, “fully connected” to the area
touched by the Project, these communities did not receive jobs related to it.7! All of these
communities, in red and in green as marked on the map, were, in his view, “peoples concerned
to the natural resources pertaining to their lands” within the meaning of Article 15 of the
Convention,” and thus entitled to “participate in the benefits of [the investor’s] activities”, as
Article 15 of the Convention requires. These views were not seriously challenged by Claimant

in cross-examination, or contradicted by other evidence before the Tribunal.

2

N

. As regards consultation, and the claim that the workshops and talleres might be sufficient to
win over these communities, Professor Pefia noted that even amongst those communities that
had been given jobs “there was a lot of opposition”.** As he put it, “many members of
Challacollo, which [ly is one of the ities that is favored [by the Project], came

out against.”*+ This testimony was not dented in cross-examination.

2

o

. The differences between the Parties on this point concerned, rather, whether all the markings
on the map were to be treated as “communities”. Questioned by a member of the Tribunal, the
Claimant’s President and Chief Executive, Mr Andrew Swarthout, asserted that:

“the towns in these little red circles are not communities. They are actually, at least some
of them I—I can't say all of them, but it looks like most of them are actually what I would
describe as little ranch clusters that belong to a community ... these belong to communities
that we did, in fact, have talleres and workshops and consultations with, so many, if not all,
of these. My colleague, Elsiario Antunez de Mayolo can better address this particular map

because he has a lot more granularity in the field, but I can say that many of these do not

constitute communities and, in fact, belong to communities that were in our community

consult list, and we can establish that we've actually included all of these.”

24. Mr Antunez de Mayolo told the Tribunal that the red circles on the map represented “groupings
of housing units or small population centers that are within the communities”, that “[t]hey are
not communities but, rather, clusters of houses.”?° He also stated that these “clusters” were
included in workshops with the four or five communities that made up the area of direct
influence,’ and that the Claimant had held “informational workshops” for communities outside
the area of direct impact.”* Yet on cross-examination Mr Antunez de Mayolo accepted that
there were four communities in the Project’s area of direct influence,”? and a further 32
communities in the area of indirect influence (14 in the Kelluyo District and 18 in the
Huacullani District).*° Mr Antunez de Mayolo also stated that he had not been aware of
opposition to the Project before he started work in April 2010, but learned of it soon after;?!
and he confirmed that it was “/ikely” communities in the direct area who had employment in

32 (with the obvious

the exploration phase would be the ones “most supportive of the project
implication that he accepted that others would oppose), but that even these supportive
communities “had concerns in connection with the Projects.”*> He stated too that he did not

speak Aymara, the language of the communities concerned.**

n

. By contrast to the apparently limited knowledge or expertise of the Claimant’s witnesses and
experts on matters Aymara, Professor Pefia Jumpa offered assistance that I found to be on point,
reliable and balanced. In summarising his reports, he explained that the Aymara community,
which was pre-Inca and had been in this southern area of Peru for “a long time”,*> had a

significant relationship to the earth (Pachama in Aymara) which provides them with natural

resources, and the mountains (Apus) which provide them with protection.*° The Santa Ana
Project was located in an area known as Chucuito. It included several districts, of which two —
Huacullani and Kelluyo — were “very important”.*” He stated that the Santa Ana Project “is
exactly on the border between both Districts” but that it also goes beyond these two districts
with regard to its effects, which reach into “adjacent areas such as Pisacoma ... and ...
Desaguadero”, both of which became “deeply involved in this conflict”, along with other areas

(Zepita, Pomata and Juli).**

26. On the limitations of the Claimant’s outreach activities he stated without equivocation, on the
basis of interviews he had conducted, that:

“Bear Creek only worked with four communities and one Parcialidad in the area linked to

the Mining Area. These four are Concepcion de Ingenio, Challacollo, Ancomarca, and the

llani, and in addition, Condor A hua is the Parcialidad.

urban ity of Fl
But the Company excluded ten communities identified by the mining company itself that
were part of their area of influence and they were excluded as well as 12 communities from
Kelluyo also located inside the area of influence that we see on the sketch.”*?
For this reason, he concluded that:
“Bear Creek's activities were not enough to obtain the communities' understanding and
acceptance” .*°
27. The effect of exclusion was significant:

“the members of the excluded communities began to protest against the Santa Ana Project.
And these protests were part of a process ... [which] entailed four stages: The looting and
burning of the camp in 2008, the Public Hearing in 2011, the organized opposition later

on afier the Public Hearing, and the social explosion in the upcoming days and weeks.”*!

28. Moreover, in his view on the basis of the materials he had reviewed, even before the looting

and burning in 2008:

“Bear Creek knew that the neighboring communities opposed the Project ... [they] knew of

the protests in advance ... they had all this information, even a month in advance.”*?

In his opinion the 2008 protest “was not an isolated terrorist act”®

, and it was “not true” that
it was an act carried out by outside forces. The protesters came from the Huacullani and
Kelluyo districts, and others: “Only a small group from Huacullani supported the Project. Most
of the members of the communities were against it, and that's why they participated in this

act.”45

29. The Claimant then withdrew temporarily from the Project, returning with what they said was
“anew strategy” “© On Professor Pejia’s view, however,

“there was no new strategy, they continued to work with the same communities and the

conflict just deepened.”*"

In other words, the evidence before the Tribunal made clear that the Claimant failed to take the

lessons from a significant, early instance of protest.

30. The next stage commenced with the public hearing held on February 23", 2011. Professor Pefia
accepted that “a large number of members of the community participated’, but based on
interviews he concluded that “some were forced to go to offer tacit approval, but the great
majority of the members showed discomfort and discontent with the Project.”** One major

problem with the meeting was that it was held in Spanish, not in Aymara.*? The evidence shows

that at that meeting the affected population had “serious concerns”.*°

31. Thereafter,
“fijn March 2011, members of the Kelluyo, Huacullani, Desaguadero, Pisacoma, Zepita

communities, among others met multiple times to organize the opposition and to call for

the cancellation of the Santa Ana Project.”*!

Many complaints were made to public authorities, but “/t/here was no response by the local or

regional Governments” >? This led to a “social explosion”, starting with local protests in
Huacullani in March 2011, which moved on to Desaguadero and Juli in April 2011, with the
blockage of an international highway and closure of the bridge connecting Bolivia to Peru. A
48-hour regional strike followed, which offered “a serious warning” given the widespread
participation, and then “the death of a protester from Kelluyo, [which] worsened the situation
amongst the community members.” Thereafter,
“Protests spread to cities with larger populations, they moved on to Juli, that was the
capital of the Province [...] finally, we see the third phase, that is the radicalization of
protests, protests at the Juliaca Airport ... [a]nd the Aymara protests took place in Lima.”**
32. The narrative is a compelling one, fully supported by the totality of evidence that is available
to the Tribunal. Finally, Professor Pejia offered his conclusion as to the investor’s appreciation
of the situation it faced:
“That Bear Creek, did not understand the Aymaras and they did not understand their
communal relations. Despite opposition to the Project, Bear Creek continued using the
same strategy that led to division amongst the communities. If Bear Creek had understood
how to work properly with the communities — with the Aymara communities, the social
conflict would not have reached crisis levels as we saw in the region.”
He adds:

“If the mining activities had not been halted, the protests would have continued.”*

3

o

. In summary, it is apparent from his testimony, which is not really contradicted by the Claimant,
that the investor’s outreach programme was inadequate: it failed to involve all the potentially
affected communities, offering jobs only to some and engaging in consultations which were
uneven and insufficient across the totality of communities. What should the Claimant have
done? Professor Pefia says the Claimant should have dealt with communities as a collective:

“rather than focus on the communities that were close to the mining field ... they should have

°2 Transcript at 1298:21-22.

%3 Transcript at 1299:3-22.

“4 Transcript at 1300:5-1301:7.
88 Transcript at 1301:12-1302:2.

included the other communities that they felt were affected.”*® He hazards the opinion that “had
they discussed with the entire collective [of communities] and reached an agreement, it is quite
likely that the answer ... would have been different.”*" Equally, he argues, a more equal
distribution of jobs, and a different approach to their being offered, would have had positive
consequences:
“The communities are interrelated. They are organized by district and province. There
is a federation of comunidades campesinas in the South, and there is a federation in
each of the districts. And you need to talk to the federations and say, ‘This is a small
project. It will focus here. We need your support so that we can distribute only 120,
150, 200 jobs. This is what we have available, and I'd like to coordinate with you how

to best distribute them.””°*

34. The lesson seems now to have been learned by the Claimant, but too late. During the hearing
Mr Swarthout confirmed that in the later Corani Project the company had drawn a bigger radius
for its consultations, now extending for over 50 kilometres, so as to “solidify a social license in
a much bigger radius than normally we would feel that we should do.”* 1 understood this as

accepting, in effect, the force of Professor Pena’s approach.

35. For my part, I was convinced by Professor Pejia’s testimony. I waited for an attack on its central
core, but none came. On the basis of it, and the totality of the evidence before the Tribunal, it
is clear that the Claimant did not do all it could have done to engage with all the affected
communities, especially after the initial protests in 2008. That evidence also makes clear that
the Claimant failed to acknowledge that those events were motivated, in significant part, by the
fact that certain affected (or potentially affected) communities had serious concerns with the
Project because of its potential environmental risks, and because they felt themselves to be
excluded from its benefits. The Claimant failed to draw the obvious and necessary conclusions
from the early indications of opposition in 2008, in particular the need to improve its

community outreach and relations.

36. This conclusion is confirmed by the helpful amicus curiae submission of DHUMA. This
contended that Claimant’s failure to engage in proper community relations contributed to the
losses it suffered, noting also that members of certain communities felt unable to participate in
the public meeting in February 2011, as there was only limited space available.” In its Reply
to the amicus, the Claimant criticised DHUMA’s written submissions, inter alia, for being
biased and unsubstantiated,°! and it described DHUMA as representing a “radical anti-mining
position”. Claimant is of course entitled not to share the policies or objectives of DHUMA,
but given its investment in a project located thousands of miles from its home, in an area
populated by local communities who are recognised by ILO Convention 169 and other rules of
international law as having legitimate interests in the use of their lands, it may want to reflect
on its approach to such interests. As an international investor the Claimant has legitimate
interests and rights under international law; local communities of indigenous and tribal peoples
also have rights under international law, and these are not lesser rights. In my view, DHUMA
assisted the Tribunal “by bringing a perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is
different from that of the disputing parties.”® Its participation in these proceedings was helpful
and polite at all times, and added to perceptions of the legitimacy of ICSID proceedings of this
kind.

37. As regards the role of the Respondent, it too has legitimate interests and rights, including
respect for the rights of the Claimant under the Canada-Peru FTA. By the means in which
Decree 032-2011 was adopted, and perhaps also for the failure to respond effectively to the
complaints received in 2011, as noted by Professor Peja, it bears a significant share of the
responsibilities. It may be the function of a State or its central government to deliver a domestic
law framework that ensures that a consultation process and outcomes are consistent with Article
15 of ILO Convention 169, but it is not their function to hold an investor’s hand and deliver a
“social license” out of those processes. It is for the investor to obtain the “social license”, and
in this case it was unable to do so largely because of its own failures. The Canada-Peru FTA is
not, any more than ICSID, an insurance policy against the failure of an inadequately prepared

investor to obtain such a license.

38. The Claimant’s contribution to the events that led to Supreme Decree 032-2011-EM being
adopted has implications for the amount of damages to be awarded. As set out in the Award,
by the time Supreme Decree 032 was adopted the prospects for the Santa Ana Project were
already dismal, if indeed they continued to exist at all. Many environmental and other permits
were still to be granted, and the nature and extent of the opposition made it clear that there was
no real possibility of the Project soon obtaining the necessary “social license”. For this reason,
the proper measure of damages for the unlawful effects of Supreme Decree 032 is, as the Award

makes clear, to be assessed by reference to the financial contribution made to the Project.

39. That financial contribution amounted to US$ 18,237,592. I conclude that the Claimant’s
contribution was significant and material, and that its responsibilities are no less than those of
the government. For this reason I would reduce the measure of damages by one half, to

US$ 9,118,796.

40. This has consequences on the allocation of the costs of this arbitration. As I have laid out in
this Dissenting Opinion, I am of the view that the actions of the Claimant and Respondent have
contributed to the demise of the Project. It is for this reason that I do not share the Majority’s
reasoning at paragraphs 730-736 of the Award. Instead, I believe that the costs of these

proceedings should be split equally between the Parties.

4

. The only other point I wish to make concerns the legitimate right of a Party to the Canada-Peru

FTA “‘to regulate and to exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare”,© a point
made by Canada in its submission.©© The Majority has ruled at paragraph 473 that Article
2201.1 of the FTA, which provides for a list of exceptions that fall within a State’s legitimate
exercise of its police powers, is exhaustive. I do not disagree with this analysis, but wish to
make clear that my support for this conclusion is without prejudice to the application of Article
25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which deals with acts of Necessity. As the

Annulment Committees in CMS and Sempra made clear, the operation of a lex specialis in a

BIT does not have the effect (unless the BIT explicitly provides otherwise) of precluding the
operation of Article 25, which continues to function as a “secondary rule of international law”
operating even when an exception under the /ex specialis is not available.®’ In the present case,
the conditions of Article 25 are not met because the act in question — the revocation of Supreme
Decree 083-2007 — was not “the only way for [Peru] to safeguard an essential interest against
a grave and imminent peril”. As noted above, and in the Award, other options were available,
including suspension of Decree 83-2007. Nevertheless, whatever the requirements of the FTA,
the possibility of having recourse to Article 25, as a rule precluding wrongfulness, is not

excluded by the FTA.
