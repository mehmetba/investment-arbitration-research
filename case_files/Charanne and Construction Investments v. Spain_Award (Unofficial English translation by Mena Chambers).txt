On 5 November 2012, the Respondent filed its submission explaining the reasons
for the need to bifurcate the proceedings, but did not expressly request such
bifurcation.

On 12 November 2012, the Claimants filed their response to the Respondent’s
submission on the bifurcation of proceedings.

On the same day, 12 November 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal, having considered the
Parties’ submissions, noted that the Respondent did not file a formal request for
bifurcation and decided to postpone its ruling in relation to the latter.

On 23 November 2012, the Tribunal held a meeting with the Parties in Madrid,
during which the final text of Procedural Order No. 1 was adopted, setting out the
rules for these arbitration proceedings. The Parties also discussed the
establishment of a provisional procedural timetable.

On 27 November 2012, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2,

When asked by the Tribunal regarding the duplicate reference to exhibit C-15, the

“Request to Bifurcate”) along with factual exhibit R-] and legal exhibits RL-1 to

SUMMARY OF THE FACTS

. Introduction

The present dispute concerns the regulatory framework of the Kingdom of Spain
regarding generation systems based on photovoltaic solar electricity. Electricity
production through photovoltaic solar energy consists of a system based on
renewable energy which is regulated by a special regime that provide for incentives
and subsidies.'?

Spain, has established, among other things, a system of premiums and regulated
tariffs to remunerate electricity production originating from photovoltaics. '*

In summary, the Claimants claim that after attracting their investments in the
photovoltaic generation sector, the Respondent has unlawfully amended the special
regime regulating the industry, causing various losses.

In the following sections, (B) a summary of the regulatory framework in force at
the time of investment; then (C) a description of the Claimant’s investment; and

(D) the regulatory changes in 2010 on which the Claimants’ claims are based will

The Electricity Sector Law

The liberalisation of the electricity sector in Spain has been implemented by Law
54/1997, of 27 November, “Law regulating the electricity sector” (the “LSE”),
which established the general regulatory framework for the sector.
Article 15 of the LSE provides: “Activities for the supply of electricity will be
economically subsidised in the manner provided in this Law, with payment of rates,
charges and prices. For the determination of rates or charges and prices that
consumers must meet, regulations for subsidies of such activities will be
established with objective, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria that
encourage an improvement in management effectiveness, economic and technical
efficiency of these activities and quality of the power supply.”
The LSE makes a distinction between an ordinary regime of energy production and
a “special” regime. Chapter II of the LSE refers to the “special regime of electricity
production” and Article 27 defines the production under the special regime as
follows:
“1. The electricity production activity will be considered as falling within the
special regime in the following cases, when performed through facilities with a
working capacity not exceeding 50 MW:
L..] () When any of the non-consumed renewable energy is used as primary
energy, as well as biomass or any type of biofuel, as long as the owner does not
carry out production activities under the ordinary regime.
2. Production under the special regime is governed by specific provisions, and
in matters not covered by them, by the applicable general provisions on
electricity production.
Provided production facilities falling under the special regime will be granted
approval by the relevant organs of the competent Autonomous Communities.”
The special regime, comparing to the ordinary regime, favours promotion of energy

production from renewable sources.

Translation by Mena Chambers

Article 30 of the LSE refers to the obligations and rights of producers under the
special regime. The obligations are set out in Article 30.1 and include the
obligations to adopt safety standards and technical regulations for production and
transportation, proper maintenance of the facilities, as well as obligations to
facilitate information necessary for public administration and relating to
performance of environmental protection requirements.
Article 30.2 provides for the following rights:
“a) To incorporate the net production of energy to the system, hereby receiving
compensation as determined in accordance with the dispositions of this Law.
For these purposes, the net production shall be considered as the total energy
production of facilities less consumption used by the power generation facility.
When conditions regarding the supply of energy render it necessary, the
Government, informed by the Autonomous Communities, will limit for a fixed
period of time the quantity of energy that can be incorporated into the system
by the producers under the Special Regime.
b) Priority access to the network of transportation and distribution of the
generated energy, in accordance with the maintenance of reliability and
security of the grids.
c) Parallel connection of the facilities to the network of the company in charge
of distribution or transportation.
d) Use, in conjunction or alternatively, of the energy acquired through other
actors.
e) To receive from the distribution company the electric energy supply required
by the conditions determined by the regulations.
Article 30.4 states that the remunerative scheme of the special regime is
accompanied with payment of premiums and notes that the amount of premiums is
determined as follows:
“it must take into account the voltage level of the power delivery network, the
effective contribution to the improvement of the environment, the saving of
primary energy and energy effectiveness, the production of heat economically
useful and costs incurred by the investment, with the objective to reach
reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of currencies in the

capital market.”

The LSE has been further developed and supplemented by various regulations
which, when relevant to the present dispute, are discussed below.

It should be recalled, as it is a basis for some of the Parties’ arguments, that in the
Spanish legal system, Laws and Royal Decree-Laws have the force of law and are
superior to Royal Decrees. Royal Decrees, having a regulatory status and being
subordinate to Laws, are implemented and supplemented by Ministerial Orders and
Resolutions, which are at a lower rank to Royal Decrees.'*

One of the distinctions between a Royal Decree and a Royal Decree-Law is that
the former involves a mandatory hearing procedure for those affected by the
regulation,'® this procedure does not apply to Royal Decree-Laws. Another
distinction is that Royal Decrees may be subject to challenge and review by organs

of administrative jurisdiction,'° whereas Royal Decree-Laws may not.
Royal Decree 436/2004

Royal Decree 436/2004 was introduced on 12 March 2004 and “establishes the
methodology for the update and systematisation of the legal and economic regime
of the electric energy production under a Special Regime”. (“RD 436/2004”)

As stated in the preamble and in Article 1, RD 436/2004 is intended to harmonize
the LSE rules, particularly, in relation to the special regime of electricity
production.

It is not in dispute between the Parties that RD 436/2004 is not applicable to the
facilities owned by T-Solar, as those facilities have been realised and registered

after RD 661/2007 was repealed.

. Presentation “The sun can be yours” of 2005

On 24 May 2005, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism of Spain
(“Minetur”) published a promotional presentation entitled “The Sun can be yours.
Answering all the Essential Questions” (“The sun can be yours 2005”),\”
paragraph 8 of which provides reasons to invest in photovoltaic installations: “The
profitability of your investment is reasonable, and could reach up to 15%” and

“With IDEA-ICO line, there is substantial financing for the investment.”

. The 2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan

On 26 August 2005, the Spanish government approved the 2005-2010 Renewable
Energy Plan by signing the agreement of the Council of Ministers (“PER 2005-
2010”),'* which contains the government’s policy in regards to the renewable
energy sector’s compliance with EU targets set out in Directive 2001/77 of 27
September 2001 (“Directive 2001/77/EC’”).

In particular, PER 2005-2010 provides that “implementation of photovoltaic solar
energy will help initialise a future of technological development, which will give to
the sector of electricity generation increasingly competitive terms in comparison
with other generating proceedings.”

PER 2005-2010 states that favourable factors for the development of the

photovoltaic industry are the “existence of a suitable and stable legal framework

J

and i: bli:

of a series of ic measures the increase of the
objective from 2010 onwards”.° Noting that “a regulatory framework aimed at
the development of this type of energy must generate a consolidated trust of the
developers, which brings them to invest in the photovoltaic sector in their
legitimate confidence that this tendency will be maintained for the long term.””'
The PER also addresses certain barriers to the development of renewable energy:
“the insufficient profitability of the installations — as it needs an high premium —
and the absence of incentives for the development of innovative facilities of
Photovoltaic energy generation”; on the regulatory aspect, among other reasons,
“the lack of regulatory harmonization at regional levels, the limitations of
conditions for payment once power capacity limits have been reached and the lack
of a norms regarding the connection to the grid of high voltage facilities.””?
Table 11 of the PER 2005-2010 contains a summary of types of photovoltaic
facilities, based on which the generation cost per KW/h is calculated. According
to this document: “generation costs are based on a 100% private investment,
excluding subsidies and tax exemptions, considering for one out of five cases a

compensation of 5% of the private investment. The lifespan and the period of

repayment of the investment is considered to be 25 years. In Type II cases of this
table, which refers to facilities with a fixed connection to the network and power
less than 100 kWp, the assumption is that they will effectively function 1250 hours
per year.”

According to PER 2005-2010, Spain’s objective was to increase the working

capacity in the photovoltaic sector to 363 MWp in the 2005-2010 period.”4

. Presentation “The sun can be yours” of 2007

In June 2007, the Minetur published another presentation entitled “The Sun can be
yours” (“The sun can be yours 2007’) that contains examples of photovoltaic
facilities with lifespans of 25 years operating between 1250 and 1664 hours per
annum and with ART yields between 7,11% and 9,58%.5

The presentation states that “subsidies for the use of grid-connected photovoltaic
installations are provided through the regulated tariff established by Royal Decree
661/2007 of 25 May, published in the B.O.E. 126 of 26 May 2007. No support is
provided for investments in that type of facilities.”**

Finally, the presentation refers to the technical construction code and five climatic

zones in Spain according to the annual solar radiation on a horizontal surface.””
Report 3/2007 of the National Energy Commission

On 14 February 2007, the National Energy Commission (“CNE”) issued report
3/2007 “concerning a proposed Royal Decree on regulation of the electric energy
production activity under a special regime and certain technology facilities
regulated under the ordinary regime” (“Report 3/2007”).”*

Section 5.3 of Report 3/2007 in paragraph (b) sets out the criteria that should direct
the regulation of the special regime: “minimising regulatory uncertainty. The CNE
understands that transparency and predictability in the future of economic
incentives reduce regulatory uncertainty, which encourages investment in new
capacities and minimises the cost of project funding, consequently reducing the

final cost for the consumer. The regulation must offer sufficient guarantees to

ensure that economic incentives are stable and predictable throughout the life of
the facility, ascertaining both transparent mechanisms for annual updating
associated with the evolution of strong rates (such as the average tariff of
reference, the CPI, ten year bonds, etc.) as well as periodic reviews, for example,

every four years that only concern new facilities in terms of investment costs which

might affect the reduction of operative costs for existing facilities”.

More precisely, paragraph (b) in section 7.2 entitled “On the criteria to minimise
regulatory uncertainty” states that “production facilities under the special regime
are demanding in terms of capital and have long repayment periods. Royal Decree
436/2004 minimises the regulatory risk by providing stability and predictability of
economic incentives for the lifespan of the facilities upon the establishment of a
transparent mechanism for their yearly update, associated with the evolution of a
strong rate as is the Average Reference Tariff (ART) and the exemption of existing
facilities from the quadrennial review, considering that the new incentives only

apply to new facilities”.

. Memorandum of the Minetur

On 21 March 2007, the Minetur published a Memorandum on the draft Decree on
regulation of energy production under the special regime and certain similar
technology facilities under the ordinary regime (“Report on RD 661/2007”).”
Section 3.2.1 of the Memorandum states that:
“Remuneration for photovoltaic solar sector is laid out in Table 3, subgroup
bd.
For installations up to 10 MW, values for the regulated tariff provide for a
proportion of an ART of 25 years at approximately 7%.
Within the range of power greater than 10 MW, an ART of less than 7% is
applied. Photovoltaic facilities of such a size are unusual and, if realised, do
not exclusively meet the profitability criteria.
These determined power objectives are extended up to 371 MW as an
established objective of working capacity with the right for photovoltaic

facilities remuneration.”

. Royal Decree 661/2007

Royal Decree 661/2007, enacted on 25 May 2007, “regulates the energy activities
under the special regime” (“RD 661/2007”). Paragraph seven of the preamble
states that RD 661/2007 replaces RD 436/2004 and that the new regulatory
framework for the electricity production under the special regime is introduced,
while maintaining the basic structure of the previous regulation.

Paragraph eight of the preamble in RD 661/2007 provides that the Decree develops
principles proclaimed in the LSE, “guarantee the facility owners operating under

the special regime reasonable compensation for their investment and guarantee

 

electricity sar ble all ion of attributable costs of the electricity
system. Accordingly, an incentive for market participation is that [this Decree]
requires a lesser administrative intervention in fixing the electricity prices as well
as a better and more efficient attribution of the costs of the system, especially in
reference to management of budget deviations and supply of additional services”.
Among other objectives, in Article 1 of RD 661/2007, it is provided that the
establishment of judicial and economic regimes of electricity production under the
special regime, replacing the one in RD 436/2004, envisages a transitory period for
facilities operating under the previous regime of RD 436/2004.
The scope of the application of RD 661/2007 is set out in Article 2.1 which states
that the electricity production facilities in Article 27.1 of the LSE fall within its
scope. Furthermore, classification of such facilities is established for various
categories. In particular, category b refers to “facilities that use as primary energy
any of the renewable energies, biomass or any type of biofuel, as long as its
beneficiary does not carry out production activities under the ordinary regime”,
and within this category subgroup b.1.1 refers to “facilities that solely use solar
radiation as primary energy by means of photovoltaic technology”.
RD 661/2007 provides for procedure of inclusion of electricity production facilities
under the special regime; the requirements are listed in Article 6:

“1. The requirements for the production facility to be included under the special

regime will be granted by the competent Administration upon prior registration

in the Administrative Register of production facilities under the special regime.

The facilities’ owners or operators that applying to be included to this regime

www.menachambers.com 25

115.

116.

117.

118.

Translation by Mena Chambers

must request the competent administration for their inclusion in one of the
categories, group or, if applicable, subgroup referred in Article 2”.
Article 9 refers to the registration requirement, and provides that in order to monitor
activities under the special regime, in particular, management and control of the
remuneration of regulated tariffs, premiums and other supplements, the facilities
must be registered with the Administrative Register of Production Facilities under
the Special Regime (“RAIPRE”).
Article 14 outlines effects of the registration in the RAIPRE and states:
“1. The final registration of the facility with the [RAIPRE] is necessary for the
application of the economic regime provided for in this Royal Decree, which
takes effect on the first day of the month following the beginning of the facility’s
activity. In any event and where appropriate, supplements and costs under this
regime will be applicable from this first day.”
The requirement for final registration with the RAIPRE is also stated in the second
paragraph of Article 17(c): “the right to receive the regulated tariff; or, where
appropriate, the premium, shall be subjected to final registration of the facility with
the [RAIPRE] prior to the deadline established in Article 22.”
The rights of producers under the special regime are established in Article 17 which
provides that, subject to Article 30.2 of the LSE, such producers shall have the
rights to:
“a) Parallel connection of its generation group or groups to the network of the
transport or distribution electricity company.
b) Transfer to the system through the transport or distribution electricity
company of the net production of electricity or sold energy, provided that
absorption of this electricity by the grid is possible.
c) Compensation of the economic regime provided by this Royal Decree,
originating from the total or partial sale of its net electric energy in any option
provided by Article 24.1. The right to receive the regulated tariff or, when
applicable, bonus, subject to the facility registration with the RAIPRE before
the deadline set out in Article 22.
d) Sell all or part of its net electricity production through direct means.
e) Have priority access and connection to the electricity grid according to the
terms set out in Annex XI of this Royal Decree or in the regulations replacing

it”

Article 24 contains a remuneration mechanisms for electricity produced under the
special regime; the article provides for two options:
“a) Transfer the electricity to the system through the transport or distribution
grid with reception through it of a regulated tariff, uniform for all the program
periods expressed in Euro cents per kilowatt-hour.
b) Sell the electricity on the electric energy production market. In this case, the
sale price of the electricity will be the price resulting from the organised market
or the price freely negotiated by the owner or representative of the facility,
supplemented, where appropriate, with a premium in Euro cents per kilowatt-
hour.
The regulated tariff is described in Article 25 as “a uniform fixed amount, which is
determined depending on the category, group or subgroup in which the facility
belongs as well as its working capacity, and, where appropriate, the amount of
time passed after the date of commissioning as determined in Articles 35 to 42 of
this Royal Decree.”
The regulated tariff for the electricity produced by means of solar photovoltaic
energy (subgroup b.1.1) is set out in Table 3 of Article 36:
a) For facilities with an output equal or exceeding 100 KW: 44,0381 Euro cents
per kilowatt-hour (“cent € x KW/h’”) for the first 25 years. Thereafter: 35,2305
cents € x KW/h.
b) For facilities with an output of between 100 KW and 10 MW: 41,7500 cents
€ x KW/h for the first 25 years. Thereafter: 33,4000 cents € x KW/h.
c) Facilities over 10 MW to 50 MW: 22,9764 cents € x KW/h for the first 25
years. Thereafter: 18,3811 cents € x KW/h.
Therefore, RD 661/2007 establishes three categories of tariffs according to the
working capacity of a plant (lesser the working capacity — higher the
compensation). Within this category, there are two fixed regulated tariffs: a higher
applicable rate for the first 25 years of the lifespan of the facility, and a lower
applicable rate starting from the 26" year.
Article 44 of RD 661/2007 provides for revision of tariffs, premiums and
supplements, in particular regarding tariff updates, the first paragraph states:
“1. [...] The value of tariffs, premiums, and other supplements and lower and
higher applicable rates of the market hourly price defined in this Royal Decree

for category b) [...] are updated on an annual basis taking as a reference the

increase of the CPI less the value established in the first additional provision of
this Royal Decree.”

The first additional provision stipulates that the reference value for the decrease of

the CPI for updates will consist of 25 basis points until 31 December 2012 and 50

basis points thereafter.

The third paragraph of Article 44 provides for revision of tariffs:
“3. During 2010, in view of the outcome of the monitoring reports on the
compliance degree with the Renewable Energy Plan (PER) 2005-2010 Strategy
for Energy Saving and Efficiency in Spain (E4), as well as new objectives in the
following Renewable Energy Plan for 2011-2020, a revision will be undertaken
regarding tariffs, premiums, and supplements, as well as lower and higher
applicable rate limits defined in this Royal Decree, taking into account costs
associated with each of these technologies, the level of involvement of the
special regime in the coverage of the demand and its impact on the technical
and economic management of the system, always guaranteeing rates of
reasonable return with reference to the cost of currency in the capital market.
Every four years thereafier, a new review will be carried out in accordance with
the above criteria.
The revisions to which this section refers regarding the regulated tariff and the
higher and lower limits do not affect facilities whose commissioning certificate
has been granted before 1 January of the second year after the year in which
there has been a revision.”

However, RD 661/2007 determined a limit up until which the facilities are entitled

to benefit under the economic regime provided for in the regulation. Article 22

entitled ‘Time limit for maintaining regulated tariffs and premiums’ stipulates that:
“Once 85 of 100 of the power objective has been reached by a group or
subgroup established in the Articles 35 to 43 of this Royal Decree, it will be
established through a Resolution of the Secretary General for Energy a
maximum time limit during which these registered facilities operating under the
special regime have the right to premiums or, where appropriate, the regulated
tariff as established in this Royal Decree for the group or subgroup; this time
limit shall not be less than twelve months.”

Moreover, with regard to administrative procedures for the inclusion of facilities

under the special regime, Article 4.3 of RD 661/2007 provides: “What is intended

www.menachambers.com 28

by substantial modification of a pre-existing facility is the replacement of essential
equipment such as boilers, motors, hydraulic turbines, or turbines in relation to
steam, wind or gas, alternators and transformers, when it is established that the
investment in the partial or full modification consists in more than 50 percent of
the total investment in the plant, valued with a replacement criteria. The
substantial modification shall give rise to a new commissioning date for the
purposes of Chapter IV.”

128. On 27 September 2007, the Secretary General for Energy enacted a Resolution in
accordance with Article 22 of RD 661/2007;*! the Resolution affirmed that from
31 August 2007 “the percentage reached in respect of the working capacity target
for solar photovoltaic technology is 91 percent, and that 100 percent of the target
will be achieved in October 2007.”** In light of this circumstance and taking into
account the fact that the timeframe for execution of a PV facility is ten months, the
Secretary General for Energy decided to set a twelve-month implementation period
for the Resolution in order for the photovoltaic power generation facilities to

register in the RAIPRE in accordance with Article 22 of RD 661/2007.
9. Report 30/2008 of the National Energy Commission

129. — Under Article 22 of RD 661/2007 and Resolution CNE of 27 September 2007, the
facilities registered after 29 September 2008 could no longer benefit from the
regime established in RD 661/2007. Therefore, it has been decided to enact a Royal
Decree to establish a new regime for such facilities.

130. On 29 July 2008, the CNE published Report 30/2008 “in relation to the proposed
Royal Decree for compensation for electricity production using solar photovoltaic
technology for facilities after to the deadline for remuneration under Royal Decree
661/2007 of 25 May, and for such technology, of 29 July 2008” (“Report
30/2008”).*>

131. In particular, in its Report 30/2008, the CNE affirmed the following:

“4.2.b) Legal certainty and protection of legitimate expectations. The stability

and predictability of economic incentives (tariffs and premiums) reduce

regulatory uncertainty, which encourages investments in new capacities to
undertake projects, while minimising the cost of financing, reducing at the same
time the final cost for the consumer. The current regulation has established
annual updates of economic incentives based on solid rates (such as the CPI,
ten year bonds, etc.). Moreover, periodic reviews every four years have been
planned solely for newly established facilities.

Indeed, the principles of legal certainty and protection of legitimate
expectations (art. 9.3 CE) are not insurmountable obstacles to modification of
the judicial framework, nor can they be used as freezing the judicial framework
at one point in time. In this sense, these principles neither restrict the dynamic
evolution of regulatory frameworks, nor can they restrict new normative
provisions to be applied in the future to situations initiated before their entry
into force. However, such principles require that regulatory innovation —
especially if it is abrupt, unpredictable and unexpected — must be carried out
with certain guarantees and caution (transitory periods to adapt to new
regimes, in some cases compensation measures, etc.) which soften, moderate or

generated by the previous legislation.”

132. And also:
“5.2 On the criterion to minimise regulatory uncertainty. The production
facilities under the special regime used to be intensive in capital and have long
term recovery timeframes. The regulation of generation facilities under the
special regime established in the Royal Decree 661/2007 attempted to minimize
the regulatory risk of this altogether, granting security and predictability to
economic incentives for the lifespan of the facilities by establishing transparent
mechanisms consisting of annual updates of such mechanisms and with the
exemption of the four-year revision for such facilities, considering that the new

incentives will only affect new facilities.”
10. Royal Decree 1578/2008

established after the deadline for maintenance of the compensation scheme of the
Royal Decree 661/2007 for such technology” (“RD 1578/2008”).°*

The preamble of RD 1578/2008 states: “the growth of the working capacity
experienced by solar photovoltaic technology is being much higher than expected
[..] in May 2008, it had already reached the 1,000 MW of working capacity.” It
also noted that the framework provided by RD 661/2007 has to be adapted to ensure
its efficiency, affirming that: “similarly to the fact that an inadequate payment
would make investments non viable, an excessive payment could have significant
consequences regarding costs to the electricity system and will discourage
commitment to research and development, thus, lowering the excellent perspectives
of this technology in middle and long terms. It is considered necessary to
rationalise the payment and, through it, to approve the Royal Decree that brings
the economic regime downwards following the hoped technological evolution and,
thus, with a long term perspective.”

Therefore, the aim of RD 1578/2008 is to maintain the system of promotion of
energy production through the photovoltaic source for facilities that could not
benefit from RD 661/2007, but reducing the incentive regime provided for in RD
661/2007.

With regard to implementation, Article 2 stipulates that RD 1578/2008 shall apply
to installations of group b.1.1 of Article 2 of RD 661/2007 (photovoltaic power
facilities), with the registration date in the RAIPRE after 29 September 2008.

RD 1578/2008 also stipulates that the facilities shall be registered to be able to
benefit from the economic regime established by the Decree; and Article 4 provides
for the establishment of a subsection of the RAIPRE — Retribution Pre-allocation
Register (“RPR”) — in which photovoltaic energy facilities should be registered.
Article 8.1 states that in order to benefit from the system provided for in RD
1578/2008, facilities shall register with the RPR and within 16 months obtain a
final registration with the RAIPRE and start selling electricity.

Unlike the system of compensation established by RD 661/2007, which provides
for a fixed compensation, the system in RD 1578/2008 provides for quarterly
tenders by quotas so that there is a fixed rate for a quota of MW. If the quota is not

reached, the rate could increase for another quota. The regulated tariff would not

www.menachambers.com 31

Translation by Mena Chambers

be fixed for the facility and would depend on the tender to which it will be assigned.
Whether the tariff will be lower or higher will depend on the specific tender.*°

140. Article 11 establishes a regulated tariff for the first tender (32 cent € x KW/h), and
the second paragraph of that article provides a mathematical formula to determine
the successive tariffs, which would be reduced to the extent that the tenders are
filled.

141. Article 11.5 stipulates that the regulated tariff applicable to a facility in accordance
with RD 1578/2008 will be maintained for a maximum period of twenty-five years
from the latest commissioning date of the facility or the date of registration with
the RPR.

142. Finally, Article 12 states that the regulated rates for subgroup b.1.1 are subject to
updates provided for in Article 44.1 of RD 661/2007 from 1 January of the second

year following the tender in which it was assigned.
C. The Claimants’ investment

143. As indicated above,** the Claimants claim to have an investment in Spain through
the T-Solar company, which is dedicated to generation and sale of electricity
produced by means of photovoltaic solar power plants. Charanne and Construction
acquired stakes in T-Solar in February 2009°’ and December 2009, respectively.**

144. T-Solar was established as a limited company (originally under the name of Tuin

D. Regulations in the photovoltaic industry after 2010

1. Royal Decree 1565/2010

148. Royal Decree 1565/2010 was promulgated on 19 November 2010 and “Regulates
and modifies certain aspects relating to the electricity production under the special
regime” (“RD 1565/2010”).*°

149. | The Claimants base their claims on two specific aspects of RD 1565/2010, which
will be described below, (a) elimination of regulated tariffs from the twenty-sixth
year for solar photovoltaic facilities, and (b) introduction of a series of additional

technical requirements.
a) Elimination of regulated tariffs from the twenty-sixth year

150. Article 1.10 of RD 1565/2010 provides that “in Table 3 of Article 36 [of RD
661/2007] rates for regulated facilities indicated for facilities of group b.1.1 are
abolished from the twenty-sixth year.” Accordingly, the facilities would maintain
regulated tariffs provided for by RD/2007 for the first 25 years of their
commissioning, but, thereafter, they would lose the right to the lower regulated

tariff from that moment until the end of the life of the installation.

2/2011 on Sustainable Economy.*”
b) Requirement of additional technical requirements

Article 1.5 of RD 1565/2010 amended paragraph (e) of Article 18 of RD 661/2007
to require facilities or groups of photovoltaic facilities exceeding 2 MW to comply
with requirements determined to overcome voltage dips in such facilities, which
were approved by Resolution of the Secretary General for Energy on 04 October
2006. Thus, it is required that facilities introduce response mechanisms to protect
the electric system in the event of power failure in the network.

Also, paragraph (e) of Article 18 of RD 661/2007 provides that compliance with
facilities’ response mechanism requirement to counter voltage dips is a necessary
condition to receive the regulated tariff and failure to comply would “result in the

imposition of the market price instead of the regulated tariff.”

. Royal Decree 1614/2010

Royal Decree 1614/2010 was promulgated on 07 December 2010 and “regulates
and modifies certain aspects relating to electricity production from solar, thermal
and wind technologies” (“RD 1614/2010”)."*

As indicated by its title, RD 1614/2010 is aimed to regulate activities of facilities
based on solar, thermal and wind technologies and, therefore, does not affect the
Claimants’ facilities based on photovoltaic technology. RD 1614/2010 introduces,
inter alia, a limit on operating hours with a right to receive premiums or premium

equivalents.
Royal Decree-Law 14/2010

On 23 December 2010, Royal Decree-Law 14/2010 on “Establishment of urgent
measures to amend the tariff deficit in the electricity sector” was promulgated
(*RDL 14/2010”). As indicated in its title, the objective of RDL 14/2010 is to

amend the tariff deficit in the electricity sector and establish a set of measures “so

46 See below, para. 165.
47 See below, para. 175.

®CL-1S.

160.

Translation by Mena Chambers

that all stakeholders in the sector contribute an additional and shared effort to the
reduction of the deficit in the electricity system”.

The preamble particularly states: “it appears reasonable that producers under the
special regime also make a contribution to mitigate additional costs. Such
contribution should be proportional to the characteristics of each technology, to
the degree of participation in the generation of these additional costs and to the
existing margin in the compensation scheme for which reasonable profitability
remains guaranteed in any event.”

The Claimants’ claims relate specifically to two aspects of RDL 14/2010, (a) the
limit on operating hours of photovoltaic facilities and, (b) the establishment of an

obligation to pay charges for the use of the transportation and distribution network.
a) Limit on the operating hours

Preamble of the Royal Decree-Law provides: “in general the possibility to limit the
equivalent operating hours is established with the recognised right to a priority
economic regime. In this manner, amounts of reference will be established in
accordance with amounts used for the calculation of the compensation established
in the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010 and those reflected in the Royal Decree
661/2007 of 25 May by which the electricity production activity will be regulated
taking into account the climate solar zone where the facility is located, in
accordance with the classification of climate zones according to the average solar
radiation in Spain established in Royal Decree 314/2006 of 17 March (RCL 2006,
655) in which the Technical Construction Code is approved.”
Such a limitation of equivalent operating hours is set out in the First Additional
Provision of Royal Decree-Law 14/2010, which provides:
“1. The photovoltaic solar technology facilities will have the right, where
appropriate, to receive each year the economic regime that had been bestowed
upon them, until they reach the number of equivalent hours of reference, taking
as a starting point zero hours of the first January of every year.
2. The equivalent hours of reference for these facilities, depending on the
climate zone where the installation site is located and determined according to
the classification of climatic zones based on the average solar radiation in
Spain established in Royal Decree 314/2006 of 17 March and in which the

Technical Construction Code is approved, will be the following:

Technology Equivalent hours of reference / year

 

Zone I | Zone II Zone lI | ZoneIV_ | Zone V
Fixed facility 1.232 | 1.362 1.492 1.632 1.753

Accordingly, the number of equivalent operating hours of an electricity
production facility is defined as the ratio between the net annual production
expressed in kWh and the nominal power of the facility expressed in kW.

3. The National Energy Commission will apply the limit on hours laid down in
this provision to settlement of premiums for the appropriate facilities of
photovoltaic solar technology. Similarly, it will also apply the limit established
in the second transitional provision regarding settlement of premiums for
photovoltaic solar facilities attached to the economic regime established in the
Royal Decree 661/2007 of 25 May. For both cases, it will be able to collect the
information necessary from the owners of the facilities and the competent
organs for the authorisation for such facilities.”

Thus, the maximum annual quota of production hours paid through the regulated

tariff is established depending on the solar zone where the photovoltaic facility is

located.

On the other hand, the second Transitional Provision of RDL 14/2010 states:
“Notwithstanding the first additional provision, until 31 December 2013
equivalent hours of reference for photovoltaic solar technology facilities
covered by the economic regime established by Royal Decree 661/2007 of 25
May, by which the activity of electricity production under the special regime is

regulated, shall as follows:

 

 

 

 

Technology Equivalent hours of reference / year
Fixed facility 1.250
Facility with 1-axis mobility 1.644
Facility with 2-axis mobility 1.707

Translation by Mena Chambers

The second transitory provision sets out the maximum production quota for the
regulated tariff applicable to facilities operating under the regime of RD 661/2007
such quota is applicable until 31 December 2013. Thereafter, these facilities will
also be subject to the limits set out in the first additional provision.

Therefore, RDL 14/2010 anticipated two limits for compensated electricity
production with the annually regulated tariff: the first transitory limit valid until 31
December 2013 applicable only to the facilities operating under RD 661/2007 and
the second permanent limit applicable to the facilities operating under RD
1578/2008, and from 1 January 2014 onwards to the facilities operating under RD
661/2007, in other words after the transitory limit is no longer applicable.

If the annual electricity production exceeds the maximum quota in a specific year,
the facilities may sell the remaining production at market price, but not at the
regulated tariff.

However, and as determined earlier,” the first Final Provision of RDL 14/2010
increased the period from 25 to 28 years, during which photovoltaic facilities

operating under the regime of RD 661/2007 are entitled to the regulated tariff.
b) Charges for access to transport networks

RDL 14/2010 also required payment of a charge of 0.5 euro/MW for access to
transport and distribution networks. In this regards, the preamble provides: “since
the generation facilities, especially those operating under the special regime, have
experienced a significant increase, an increase of investment in the transport and
distribution networks of electricity has occurred in order to evacuate the facilities’
spilling energy. In the current context of crisis and tariff deficiency, it remains
justified that the generators contribute to the costs attributable to the investments
through the payment of charges, as regulatory charges are not developing, to
satisfy electricity producers, transporters and distributors an access charge of 0,5
EUR/MWh will be applied with reference to the framework established by the valid
regulations of the European Union.”

The obligation to pay charges is established in the first Transitory Provision, which
provides: “from I January 2011 onwards, and as long as regulatory charges are

not developed that would satisfy electricity producers, transporters and

distributers shall apply to producers that are connected to their grid an access
charge of 0,5 EUR/MWh to be transferred to their grids or values established by
the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce within the limits established by

the normative framework of the European Union.”
Legal challenge to RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010

Approval of RD 1565 and RDL 14/2010 resulted in (a) proceedings brought before
the Spanish Constitutional Court by the Autonomous Communities of

b) Administrative proceedings before the Supreme Court

In July 2011, company Isolux Corsan together with the Spanish companies that
own plants, filed an administrative appeal No. 60/2011 before the Spanish Supreme
Court challenging RD 1565/2010, and on 4 July 2011, T-Solar together with its
subsidiaries that own the photovoltaic generation plants brought a direct
administrative appeal No. 64/2011 challenging RD 1565/2010 before the Spanish
Supreme Court.**

Appeal 60/2011 was dismissed by the Supreme Court in its judgment of 24
September 2012,°° and appeal 64/2011 was dismissed by the Supreme Court in its
judgment of 15 October 2012. In both cases the Court concluded that RD
1565/2010 was consistent with the law and did not violate investors’ legitimate

expectations in accordance with the Spanish law.*!
©) Proceedings before the ECHR

On 4 July 2011, various subsidiaries of T-Solar filed a claim against Spain before
the ECHR, seeking a declaration that RDL 14/2010 was in violation of Article I of
the Additional Protocol, and Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention for the Protection
of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.

On 12 December 2013, the ECHR announced its final decision not to admit the
claim, stating that it did not meet the admissibility criteria set out in Articles 34 and

Law 2/2011 on Sustainable Economy

The Law 2/2011 ‘Sustainable Economy’ was adopted on 4 March 2011 (“Law
2/2011”), which amends the time limit during which a photovoltaic plant can be
operating and be entitled to receive the regulated tariff. This limit, which has been

previously increased to 28 years by RDL 14/2010° is increased to 30 years.

concerns, similar to RDL 14/2010, only the facilities covered by the previous

regime established under RD 661/2007.°°
2. Royal Decree-Law 1/2012

178. Royal Decree-Law 1/2012 was promulgated on 27 January 2012 (“RDL 1/2012”),
which suspends pre-allocation remuneration procedures and removes economic
incentives for new photovoltaic facilities that have not been registered with the

RPR as provided for in Article 4.1 of RD 1578/2008.
3. Royal Decree-Law 9/2013

179. — Royal Decree-Law 9/2013 was promulgated on 12 July 2013 “by which urgent
measures are taken to ensure the financial stability of the electrical system” (“RDL
9/2013”). In its sole Repealing Provision, this norm derogated from RD 661/2007
and RD 1578/2008, although it provided for their temporary application until the
implementation of RDL 9/2013 is finalised.

180. Article 1.2 of RDL 9/2013 amended Article 30.4 of the LSE, which now read as
follows:

“Additionally, and in the terms of regulations by Royal Decree of the Council
of Ministers, compensation for the sale of energy generated will be determined
and valued at the market price, facilities should receive a specific compensation
composed by a term per unit of installed power that covers the costs of
investment in a facility that cannot be reclaimed through the sale of energy and
aterm of the operation which covers, where appropriate the difference between
the costs of exploitation and the resources of the participation in the market of
this type of facility.

In order to calculate the specific remuneration for a facility, it will be taken into
account, apart from the regulatory lifespan of the facility and in reference with
the activity realised by an efficient and well managed company:

a) The standard income from the sale of generated energy valued at the market

price.

°° Tt is based on the previous increase made and the First Final Provision of RDL 14/2010, in which reference was
made only to the facilities pertaining to RD 661/2007.

©) The standard value of the initial investment.

For this purpose, in no case will it be taken into account costs or investments

that would be determined by norms or administrative acts and that are not

applicable in the entirety of Spanish territory. In the same vein, it will only be
taken into account of the costs and investments that relate exclusively to the
activity of electricity production.

[.]

This remuneration system will not exceed the required minimum level to cover

costs that allow these facilities to experience competition on an equal footing

with the rest of technologies on the market and that have the possibility to obtain

a reasonable profit by reference to the type of facility. Nevertheless, the

emoluments may exceptionally also take into account an incentive for the

investment and the execution in a determined timeframe when the facility
supposes a significant reduction of the costs in the island and extraterritorial
systems.

Such a reasonable profitability will focus, prior to taxes, on the average

profitability of the secondary market of State Obligations for ten years in

applying the appropriate differential.

The parameters of the compensation regime may be revised every six years.”
The First Additional Provision of RDL 9/2013 provided: “Jn accordance with the
penultimate paragraph of Article 30.4 of the [LSE] for facilities that were entitled
to the priority economic regime at the date of the entry into force of this Royal
Decree, reasonable profitability will focus, before taxes, on the average
profitability of the secondary market of State Obligations for ten years increased
by 300 basic points. Such focus shall be performed without prejudice to the
revision provided for in the last paragraph of this article.”

The Second Final Provision stipulates that “the Government, upon proposal of
[Minetur], will adopt a royal decree regulating the legal and economic framework
for electricity production facilities from renewable energy sources, co-generation
and waste with the grant of a retribution to amend the compensation model of
existing facilities. This new model should comply with the criteria set out in Article
30 of the [LSE] introduced by this royal decree-law and will apply from the entry

into force of this royal decree-law.”

183. | RDL 9/2013 applies from the date of its entry into force, 14 July 2013, but provides
that until the approval of the decrees establishing the specific remuneration,
operators registered under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 will continue receiving
compensation in the form of payment on account in accordance with scheme

applicable under the new methodology.”

4. Law 24/2013

184. Law 24/2013 “the Electricity Sector” was enacted on 26 December 2013 (“New
LSE”).

185. The New LSE establishes the principle of ‘economic and financial sustainability
of the electricity system’. In this regard, the preamble states: “The principle of
economic and financial sustainability of the electricity system will be a guiding
principle for the actions of Public Administrations and other subjects within the
scope of this Law. Moreover, any regulatory action in relation to the sector which
presumes an increase in costs for the electricity system or a reduction in income
shall incorporate an equivalent reduction in other cost items or an equivalent
increase in revenue in order to ensure the balance of the system. Accordingly, the
possibility of accumulation of new deficits as it happened in the past will be ruled

out.”

5. Order IET/1045/2014

186. Order IET/1045/2014 adopting ‘the remuneration parameters for certain power
generation facilities from renewable energy sources’ (“Order TET/1045/2014”)

was issued on 16 June 2014 and entered into force on 21 June 2014.

VI. THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON JURISDICTION
A. The Respondent’s position

187. |The Kingdom of Spain has raised objections to the jurisdiction of the Arbitral
Tribunal on the following grounds: (1) lack of subject matter jurisdiction; (2) the
“fork in the road” provision has been activated; (3) the dispute and the Parties are

subject to the rules governing the internal market of the European Union and the

© RDL 9/2013, Third Transitory Provision; Reply, para. 205.

Translation by Mena Chambers

dispute should be settled according to the judicial system of the EU; (4) the

Claimants are not investors in accordance with Article 1(7) ECT.
1. Lack subject matter jurisdiction

188. According to the Respondent, RDL 9/2013 expressly repealed RD 661/2007, RD
1578/2008 and Article 4 of RDL 6/2009, and it must be considered to have repealed
RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010, that is to say, all the rules on which the
Claimants have based their claim in this arbitration against Spain.”°

189. RDL 9/2013 has established a new compensation system different from the
previous one, which is determined in a new regulatory framework comprised of
RDL 9/2013, the New LSE, RD 413/2014, and Order IET/1045/2014 of 16 June
2014.” Moreover, the new regulations entirely absorb any previous adaptation or
regulatory measure, as they calculate a reasonable profitability with respect to the
whole lifespan of the plant, therefore including in the calculation the first years of
operation, so it is not possible to consider previous regulations separately.”

190. | The Respondent affirms that the Claimants’ claim and their calculation of damages
are based on regulations that have been repealed and, therefore, have no merit.”>

191. | The Claimants did not make specific claims under RDL 9/2013 and subsequent
regulations, and could not do so as they are bringing a claim based on them before
another arbitral tribunal and if they also did so in these arbitral proceedings they
would benefit from illicit enrichment. Now the Claimants are lodging a claim on
these regulations before another arbitral tribunal and if they would be doing so in
this arbitration, the Claimants would be unjustly enriched.” According to the
Respondent, company Isolux Corsan Infrastructure Netherlands B.V., which is the
same company through which the Claimants’ investments are structured, on 3
October 2013 brought an arbitration claim against Spain based on alleged breaches
of the ECT, and the only difference between the mentioned proceeding and the
present claim is that the former is based also on the new regulations that are in

force.”*

192. The Respondent sustains that if the Tribunal considered the Claimants’ pleas on
the basis of the new regulations that are not the object of these proceedings and
over which Spain is not exercising its right of defence, that would constitute an
abuse of due process.”°

193. Finally, the Respondent argues that Spain has not approved the new legislation to
circumvent this arbitration as the Claimants argue. On the contrary, the
supervening lack of subject matter has been created by the Claimants themselves
who chose not to file claims related to the new regulations before this Tribunal, but

before another arbitral tribunal.”

2. The Claimants have activated the ‘fork in the road’ provision of the ECT

 

194. The Respondent refers to the fork in the road provision contained in Article
26(3)(b)(i) of the ECT, which is aimed at preventing an investor from unjustly
resorting to parallel dispute resolution mechanisms (one at the national level and
another at the international level).”*

195. The Respondent sustains that the activation of the fork in the road provision has
occurred, on one hand, as a consequence of filing before the Supreme Court by T-
Solar and all of the investment special purpose vehicles owners of photovoltaic
plants, as well as by Isolux Corsan, of the administrative claims No. 64/2011 and
No. 60/2011, respectively, in relation to RD 1565/2010; on the other hand, due to
the presentation brought by several companies of T-Solar of a claim before the
European Court of Human Rights.”

196. | With regard to the claim filed before the ECHR seeking a declaration that RDL
14/2010 is contrary to Community law and requesting compensation, this claim
alone would have already activated the fork in the road provision as it constitutes
an abuse of right to use two parallel proceedings for the same claim to maximise
possibilities to be heard.*° Whilst the Claimants did not present claims in the
Spanish courts, they did resort to “a previously agreed dispute settlement
procedure”, as provided in subparagraph (b) of paragraph 2 of Article 26 of the
ECT.

197. Finally, it is irrelevant that the claim before the ECHR has not been admitted, since
the fork in the road provision was activated at the time of submission of the claim,
and such a clause only provides for its non-application when the investor renounces
other dispute settlement procedures, in the present case the claim did not continue
before the ECHR as it was not admitted; but the investors did not withdraw their
claim.*!

198. In relation to the proceedings before the Spanish courts, the Respondent denies the
Claimants’ arguments concerning alleged breach of the triple identity test, claiming
that a strict and limited application of these requirements would in practice prevent
the application of the provision.” According to the Respondent the conditions of

the triple identity test have been met.
a) Identity of the Parties

199. | The Respondent affirms that the identities of the special purpose vehicle companies
that together with T-Solar initiated proceedings before the Spanish court are the
same as those forming the Claimants’ investments in this arbitration, which is
shaped by direct and indirect participation of Charanne and Construction in T-
Solar.

200. According to the Respondent, should proceedings 64/2011 continue, it would result
in an identical claim as the one in the present arbitration with regard to RD
1565/2010.

201. In this regard, the Respondent argues that international law supports the
Respondent’s position that the economic unity of the claiming entities and the
economic effects of each case should be taken into account when analysing the

identity of the parties.*°

202. Moreover, the Respondent affirms that, had it been ruled, the Supreme Court’s
judgment of inadmissibility would have had an erga omnes effect independent of
whom the claimants are. According to Spanish law, judgments declaring
inadmissibility of general character have a declarative effect erga omnes and ex

tunc.*6
b) Identity of the subject matter

203. Concerning the subject matter, the actors in the proceedings before the Spanish
courts in essence made the same claims that the Claimants in the present arbitration,
although adapted to the particularities of these proceedings.*’ Contrary to the
arguments of the Claimants, not only a judgment declaring annulment of RD
1565/2010 was requested in the administrative proceedings, but also compensation
for damages in the same way as it has been done in these proceedings.**

204. Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the claims before the Spanish Supreme
Court also referred to RDL 14/2010 and, in its decision, the court also ruled with
respect to this norm.®’ In any event, a ruling erga omnes regarding RD 1565/2010
would have affected the system of legislative adaptations as a whole, as its

justification is similar.”
©) Identification of the cause of action

205. Finally, the Respondent contends that it is normal for each proceeding to be based
on specific norms of each system, domestic or international, and that what is
relevant is the analysis of the existence of an essential genuine identity between the
causes of action and not an absolute identity.”!

206. In this regard, the request in this arbitration to declare that the enactments carried
out by Spain infringe the ECT and the request compensation for losses is equivalent
to the request of ANULACION of RD 1565/2010 before the Spanish Supreme

Court and the corresponding claim for compensation for losses.”” The Respondent

finally argues that the Spanish Supreme Court also declared the absence of any

infringement of the ECT in its decisions in appeals 60/2011 and 64/2011.

. Itis an intra-European dispute not subject to the ECT

 

The Respondent submits that countries which the Claimants claim to be nationals
of, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, as well as Spain itself, have been members
of the European Union (“EU”) before they negotiated and ratified the ECT which
means that the dispute brought is an intra-EU dispute."

The intra-European investment relations are subject to the specific regulatory
framework of the EU, which thoroughly deals with all matters governed by
investment treaties, including those covered by the ECT.”° Therefore, the ECT is
not applicable to investments made within the EU by nationals of EU Member
States (“Member States”), and does not confer any right to such nationals,
including in particular the right to resolve disputes through arbitration.”°
According to the Respondent, the resolution of intra-European disputes is governed
in a restrictive manner by the judicial system established under EU law, according
to which each judge of a Member State acts as a judge of the EU and directly
applies its laws. If any conflict arises regarding its application, the resolution of
disputes are submitted to the Court of Justice of the EU (“CJEU”), which is also
the court of last resort, in order to ensure the system’s integrity and coherence.”’
In addition, investors may directly lodge a complaint before the European
Commission to initiate proceedings against the infringing State under Article 258
of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”).”*

Regarding the Claimants’ allegation that Article 258 TFEU refers to disputes
between States,” the Respondent asserts that this claim is unfounded and that most
of the proceedings initiated by the EC against Member States under Article 258

have been initiated at the request of private parties.'°°

The Respondent asserts that, apart from the case of Eastern European States that
subsequently joined the EU, bilateral investment treaties between EU Member
States never existed as that the very objective of the EU was to create an internal
market that included free circulation of capital and to establish all the necessary
guarantees. |"!

According to the Respondent, both the literal good faith interpretation of the
wording of the ECT, systematic interpretation and other supplementary means of
interpretation in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on
the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”) support its position!”

Article 26 of the ECT requires diversity, in that the investor that brings a claim
against a contracting party of the ECT (“Contracting Party”) must be an investor
of a State other than the Respondent Contracting Party, and the investment must be
made in the territory of a Contracting Party other than the one from which the
investor comes from.

For the purposes of the ECT, an investor of a Member State of the EU is both an
investor of that State and of the EU, and in accordance with Article 1(10) of the
ECT the EU is a Regional Economic Integration Organisation (“REIO”), which
covers the territory of Spain, as well as Luxembourg and the Netherlands, thus the
diversity criteria between the territory of an investor and territory of the other

Contracting Party receiving the investment is absent.'”

According to the
Respondent, the definition of territory of States in paragraphs (a) and (b) in Article
1(10) of the ECT only applies to States that are not members of the REIO,'**

As for its object and purpose, the Respondent contends that the ECT was designed
to establish a regime of protection of investments in the countries of the former
communist bloc without changing the intra-community regime. The purpose and
intent of the ECT can only be to establish a special regime for protection of energy
investments outside the borders of the EU.'°*

The Respondent also argues that interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT in the
context of other articles of the treaty confirms Spain’s position. Thus, in the event

of disputes between EU Member States, arbitration clause provided in Article 27

of the ECT does not allow arbitration between Member States but provides that

such disputes would be subjected to the exclusive competence of the EU

jurisdictional mechanisms.'°

217. According to Spain, the prohibition of investor-State arbitration between Member
States derives from jurisprudence of the CJEU, and, in particular, with the decision
in the Mox Plant case,!°” in which it was established that in accordance with Article
344 TFEU! disputes that involve Member States and refer to EU law must be
resolved in accordance with the procedures provided by the TFEU. In this sense,
“mixed” international treaties, that is treaties ratified by both States and the EU,
are considered to be an integral part of EU law.'”

218. The Respondent asserts that acts subsequent to the signature of the ECT also
confirm its interpretation. The Respondent refers to the positions expressed by
various EU institutions,''® particularly by the European Commission,''' the
executive body of the EU that signed the ECT on behalf of the EU.'!”

219. The Respondent also points out that instruments enacted by the EU with the
objective of compliance with the ECT do not contain any reference to intra~EU
disputes which demonstrates that it has not been considered that the ECT could

apply to the resolution of such disputes.''?

4. The Claimants are not investors in accordance with Article 1(7) of the ECT

 

225. The Respondent claims that behind the corporate veil of Charanne and
Construction, the actual claimants in this arbitration are two natural persons of
Spanish nationality, Messrs José Gomis Cafiete and Mr Luis Antonio Delso
Heras.’

226. According to the Respondent, the legal entity making the investment is not
protected by the ECT, regardless of its place of incorporation, if it is controlled by
national investors of the same State where the investment has been made.'”° This
is because Article 26(1) of the ECT requires diversity of nationalities to bring an
arbitration claim.'?”

227. The Respondent contends that although there is a formal line of interpretation in

128

arbitration in respect of the nationality of a claimant legal entity, ~” there is a more

appropriate line of interpretation that requires effective nationality of the legal
entity,'”° because investment treaties were created to encourage foreign investment
and not investment of own nationals.

228. According to the latter line of interpretation, the ‘foreign’ feature is not only a
formal requirement but also an objective condition, which allows tribunals to
pierce the corporate veil to give light to the actual controllers of the companies,
and to deny jurisdiction when it becomes clear that the actual controllers are
nationals of the respondent State.'*°

229. According to Spain, the reasoning in the decision it uses as support its position is
perfectly valid, regardless of whether decisions have been made within the
framework of ICSID arbitrations and not the ECT, as in any event it relates to
instruments intended to establish mechanisms to resolve problems that arise in the

context of commercial relations between States and nationals of other States.'*!

under the ECT is compatible with EU law; and (4) assert that the Claimants are

legitimate investors under the ECT.
Argument concerning lack of subject matter jurisdiction should be rejected

The Claimants argue that the adoption of RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 have
reduced the economic value of their shares and returns in T-Solar, regardless of
whether these regulations have been repealed or subsequently absorbed by RDL
9/2013, as it is unquestionable that damage has been caused.'*?

The measures under consideration in this arbitration are RD 1565/2010 and RDL
14/2010 only, nevertheless, the Claimants assert that such measures have been
merely the first steps undertaken by Spain to carry out the complete dismantling of
the special regime provided for in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.'** The new
regime introduced by RDL 9/2013 did not remedy the conduct of Spain, but has
aggravated the situation created by the measures under consideration in this
arbitration.'*°

Spain cannot take advantage of its own conduct, which has also further exacerbated
the situation of the Claimants, to avoid responsibility under the ECT.'*°

The Claimants deny that RDL 9/2013 affects the subject matter of this arbitration,
but even if it does, the measures under consideration in this arbitration, RD

1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010, remained in force for a period of nearly three years

the measures.'>”

2. The Claimants did not exercise the “fork in the road” provision of the ECT

 

236. The Claimants recognise that Article 26(3) of the ECT contains a “fork in the road”
provision, which provides that arbitration and recourse to ordinary courts of a
Contracting Party are alternative and exclusive paths. However, the Respondent’s

argument should be rejected because the universally recognized test'**

of the triple
identity that requires that proceedings before domestic courts and proceedings
before an arbitral tribunal share (a) the same parties, (b) the same subject matter,

and (c) the same legal basis, has not been met.'*°

a) Absence of identity between the parties

237. There is no identity of the parties as Charanne and Construction are not parties to
any proceedings before the Spanish courts, since it was the companies that own the
plants that initiated legal proceedings in Spain. These companies do not fall within
the scope of the ECT.'*°

238. The ECT expressly provides that it must be the investor who choses to resort to
domestic courts and not its shareholders or subsidiaries. The fact that the Claimants
have corporate links with the companies Grupo T-Solar and Grupo lsolux Corsan
does not allow to ignore the legal personality of the Claimants.'*!

239. The Respondent’s argument that the Claimants would benefit from the potential
strike down requested in the proceedings before the Supreme Court as it has erga
omnes effect is irrelevant with regard to the “fork in the road” provision since such
analysis would lead to an absurd result of not admitting arbitration claims brought

by third parties that could benefit from a general decision.'

b) Absence of identity as to the subject matter

There is no identity as to the subject matter. In administrative-contentious
proceedings before the Supreme Court, the requesting parties sought to strike down
RD 1565/2010 as violating Spanish law,'** whereas in the present arbitration the
Claimants request the Arbitral Tribunal to declare the incompatibility of RD
1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 with the provisions of the ECT, and consequently
order the Kingdom of Spain to pay compensation the damage suffered as a result
of the adoption and entry into force of these regulations.'“*

Although in the claims brought before the Supreme Court damages have also been
requested, the Claimants submit that there cannot be an identity as to the subject
matter between a claim based on Spanish law seeking to strike down of a
regulation, and an international claim requesting compensation for damage caused

due to the violation of international obligations of the State.'**
©) Absence of identity as to the legal basis

There is also no identity as to the legal basis. The actions before the Spanish courts
are based on the violations of the Spanish legal system, in particular Articles 9.3
and 14 of the Spanish Constitution and Article 30.4 of the LSE, whereas the present
claim is based on the ECT and international law.'*°

The Claimants contend that the purpose of the “fork in the road” provision is
precisely to prevent a party from submitting the same claim before multiple fora in
respect of a violation of an obligation arising under Part III of the ECT and relating
to an investment.'*” The provision would also have been triggered if the Claimants
would have requested the application of the ECT before Spanish courts, but this
has not happened. '“*

Regarding the claim filed by several companies of the T-Solar group before the
ECHR, the “fork in the road” provision is irrelevant since it only concerns
proceedings before “courts or administrative tribunals” of Spain as provided by

Article 26(2)(a), and concerns neither proceedings before an international tribunal,

nor proceedings “previously agreed” between the Parties as provided in Article
26(2)(b).'*° In any case, the mentioned claim does meet the triple identity test as
there is no identity of the parties, the subject matter or the legal basis.'*° Finally,
the abovementioned claim has not been admitted by the ECHR and, therefore,

proceedings may be considered as have not been initiated. '*!
3. The ECT is applicable to this dispute and does not undermine EU Law

245. According to the Claimants, the TFEU and the ECT are different instruments with
different scopes of application. While the TFEU regulates the functioning of the
EU and establishes freedoms for the community of EU citizens, the ECT focuses
on investments in the energy sector, and establishes a legal framework open to any
State to foster long-term cooperation in the field of energy.'*?

246. The rights and specific protection of investments provided for in the ECT are
broader or simply absent in EU law which generally regulates the economic and
legal aspects of energy circulation in the EU.'** The Claimants refer to decisions
of various arbitral tribunals that, in analysing the relationship between EU law and
investment treaties, have concluded that both have different fields of application
and that investment treaties are applicable to intra-EU disputes.'™*

247. Compatibility between the ECT and EU law has been recognized by various

155

arbitral tribunals'*> as well as national judges of EU Member States.'*° In any case,

Article 16 of the ECT would resolve in favour of the investor any incompatibility

that may exist with any other international agreement.'*’

248. Claimants also argue that the ECT is compatible with the judicial system of the
EU, as they bring this claim on the basis of violations of the ECT and not of EU
law. The reference, made by the Respondent, to Article 258 of the TFEU concerns
a different case, in which the EC initiates infringement proceedings against a

Member State for violation of obligations under Treaties, making it legitimate for

it to go before the CJEU. This arbitration is neither between Member States nor

between a State and the EU, but between investors of a Contracting Party of the
ECT and another Contracting Party.'* Decisions of the CJEU cited by the
Respondent in this regard are irrelevant since they refer to acts of the Community
unrelated to the present case,'* or to disputes between States.'°°

249. Although the present dispute does not concern EU law but the ECT, the Claimants
assert that whilst the CJEU is competent to perform the definitive interpretation of
EU law, the arbitral tribunals and other national courts could and should apply this
law when it is necessary to resolve a dispute.'*!

250. Regarding interpretation of the ECT in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the
VCLT, the Claimants maintain that the literal interpretation of Article 26(1) of the
ECT solely requires that the investment has been made in the territory of a
Contracting Party and that this party has breached its obligations under the ECT
with regard to investors of another Contracting Party. In the present case, the
investment was made on Spanish territory, it was Spain that breached the ECT and
the Claimants come from the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

251. As for the argument of Spain regarding the territory of the REIO, the ECT in reality
distinguishes between two types of territories, the territory of the Contracting Party
and the territory of the REIO. When claiming against a Member State, its territory
will be relevant; in case of the REIO, the relevant territory will be the one of the
REIO. If the intention of the signatory parties of the ECT had been to exclude
internal claims between countries that form part of the REIO, then such an
exception would have been expressly stated. '

252. As for the Respondent’s argument!® and the letter of the European Commission!“

regarding the existence of an implicit disconnection clause in the ECT for the EU
Member States, according to which the ECT would not be applicable to intra-

community relations, the Claimants submit that it is clear that the disconnection

clause does not exist in an explicit manner in the ECT, even though the signatory
States knew about this mechanism and in fact applied it to less relevant issues.'®
253. Neither are relevant the EC’s arguments with regard to the definition of the REIO
in Article 1(3) of the ECT, stipulating that Member States of the REIO have
transferred to it competences, including the competence to “make binding

decisions”,|°

as it only constitutes a general description of the REIO without

establishing which competences have been transferred or which decisions of the

REIO would be binding, and, therefore, does not allow to reach the conclusions

that the EC is seeking.'®”

254. The Claimants also claim that the text of the document “Transparency; Policies,
practices and conditions of the Contracting Parties”! cited by the EC! does not
preclude in any way an EU Member State from initiating arbitral proceedings under
Article 26(1) of the ECT against another Member State. This document refers to
cases where a claim was brought against the EU under the ECT, admitting a
possibility of simultaneous claims against a Member State and the EU, but from
such text it cannot be inferred what the EC is seeking.'”

255. The Claimants also note that the Respondent’s arguments based on Article 27 of
the ECT and Articles 344 and 259 of the TFEU, and the decision in the Mox Plant
case are irrelevant in this case, as it is not a dispute between States. 'l Besides, the
Claimants contend that the Respondent’s analysis of the Mox Plant decision is
incorrect as the CJEU indeed took into account that the dispute was between States
and did not conclude that international treaties signed by both Member States as
well as the EU itself are part of EU law; the CJEU rather considered that the areas
to which the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea was applied, were
broadly regulated by Community acts, and, therefore, constituted a part of the

Community’s legal order.'””

256. The Claimants assert that no arbitral tribunal or EU tribunal has determined that

EU law prevents an arbitral tribunal from assuming jurisdiction over a dispute

between an investor of a Member State and another Member State.’

257. With respect to the instruments formulated by the EC and invoked by the

Respondent,'”

none of them meets the requirements of Article 31(2)(b) of the
VCLT as they were not “made [...] in connection with the conclusion of the treaty”
or “accepted by the other [Contracting Parties to the ECT] as an instrument related
to the treaty.” In any event, such documents make no reference to intra-community
disputes.'”°

258. Regarding the subsequent acts that, according to the the Respondent, would support

176

its position, ° the Claimants maintain that they cannot be considered as

“subsequent practice” within the meaning of Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT, that
allow to interpret the content of Articles 1(7) and 26 of the ECT, as they do not
refer to the application of such articles, neither are they useful to prove the
agreement of the parties , as they emanate from EU organs and not from the States
parties of the ECT, and moreover they lack the necessary frequency and coherence
to be considered as concordant, common and coherent practice.'” On the other
hand, the EU Regulation 1219/2012 recognises in its fifth recital that “bilateral
investment agreements remain binding on the Member States under public
international law and will be progressively replaced by agreements of the Union
relating to the same subject matter”.\”*

259. The position of the European Commission in previous cases does not have the
relevance assigned by the Respondent because the EC is not a party to the ECT,
but an organ that has intervened in arbitration proceedings to defend its own
interests. In addition, arbitral tribunals have consistently rejected the EC’s

arguments, which the Respondent brings in support of its claims.'”

271.

272.

The Claimants submit that (1) the modifications introduced by the Government of
Spain have retroactively affected the legal and economic regimes established by
previous regulations on which the Claimants relied upon in carrying out their
investments, (2) therefore, resulting in various breaches of the ECT, which (3) have

caused damage to the Claimants that must be repaired.
Regulatory changes

The Claimants refer to the following changes implemented through RD 1565/2010
and RDL 14/2010:

a) Limited term for regulated tariffs

Article 1.10 of RD 1565/2010 removed the second stage of regulated tariffs for
facilities covered by RD 661/2007, i.e. the compensation applicable for the first 25
years from the date of commissioning of the facility. Although the limit for
regulated tariffs in the first stage was subsequently extended to the first 30 years
by Law 2/2011, the provision of Article 1.10 of RD 1565 eliminated the possibility
of regulated tariffs thereafter.'°°

According to the Claimants, photovoltaic solar facilities do not have a limited
lifespan as long as adequate technical maintenance is carried out,'®° which does not
violate Article 4.3 of RD 661/2007.'*” In any case, the rules existing at the time
did not limit the useful lifespan of the facilities in a specific number of years.'**
The Claimants also allege that the Respondent is not correct in its assertion that for
facilities covered in RD 1578/2008 the extension of the period to 30 years with
entitlement to regulated tariffs offsets the operating time limits imposed by RDL
14/2010'® since the extension of the period entitling to regulated tariffs applies

only to facilities covered by RD 661/2007, but not by RD 1578/2008.7

b) Imposition of limits on equivalent production hours

The First Additional Provision of RDL 14/2010 established a limit of equivalent
hours of reference within which the facilities covered by RD 661/2007 and RD
1578/2008 can receive the regulated tariff. The electricity produced beyond that
limit would not benefit from the regulated tariff price.

The Claimants contend that that limit was not based on the regulatory framework,
in which there did not exist any differentiation of treatment or limitation of hours
based on geographic area. According to the text of the PER 2005-2010 referred to

201

by the Respondent to assert the existence of previously implicit limits,” the text

solely refers to standard cases, which do not impose maximum limit on operating

2
hours.?°?

©) Obligation to fulfil technical requirement against voltage dips

Article 1.5 of RD 1565/2010 established a new obligation to comply with the
technical requirements to respond to voltage dips. According to the Claimants, this
new obligation involved a significant expense for the generators, without
considering any financial compensation whatsoever, unlike what was done
previously with respect to wind technology, where Spain had indeed proposed to
compensate investors by paying a specific complement of 0,38 Euro cents for

compliance with the technical requirements."">

d) Obligation to pay a charge for grid access

The First Transitional Provision of RDL 14/2010 introduced a new obligation for
electricity producers to pay a charge for access to the transportation network of 0,5
EUR/MWh from January 2011, as long as charges that should be paid by producers
of electric energy are not developed.” The mentioned charge had to be paid
entirely by the photovoltaic facilities that were covered by a priority regime with

which they cannot amortise on the electricity prices, unlike ordinary producers.””°

Breaches of the ECT

According to the Claimants, through the actions outlined above, Spain (a)
expropriated Claimants’ investments in breach of Article 13 ECT and breached,
(b) its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment of investment in
accordance with Article 10(1) ECT, and (c) its duty to provide investors with

effective means to defend their rights under Article 10(12).
a) Expropriation in breach of Article 13 of the ECT

The Claimants submit that the ECT includes a broad concept of investment in
Article 1(6), and therefore its protection covers the shares that the Claimants own
in T-Solar, including not only ownership but also their economic value and
returns.”

Furthermore, the Claimants allege that protection against expropriation according
to Article 13(1) ECT not only refers to expropriation in the traditional sense of the
term, but includes measures of equivalent effect, that is, measures that, although
not directly affecting formal ownership of an asset, affect its potential profitability,
which is diminished or eliminated by the action of the State.?””

According to the Claimants, Spain’s measures have deprived them of the value of
shares as well as of the profits from the facilities, and therefore said measures have
an effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation in breach of Article 13(1)
ECT2%

The Claimants deny the Respondent’s arguments in the sense that the hope for

209

future profits can not be considered as a right,~” and affirm that in Spanish law

282. And although they consider irrelevant the alleged requirement that it should consist

2ut

in “acquired” rights, which is not contained in the ECT,” the Claimants also assert

that the facilities that complied with the requirements for registration with the
RAIPRE and the RPR, had indeed acquired the right to compensation established
by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008."

283. The severity of the impact of the measures is the essential element to assess the
occurrence of an expropriation, as it is necessary to deprive the investor of a
significant part of the enjoyment or economic use of his investment? The
Claimants contend that the arbitral jurisprudence does not require the total
destruction of the investment but that a significant or substantial interference would
be enough.?"*

284. According to the Claimants, the measures adopted in RD 1565/2010 and RDL
14/2010 have caused a brutal economic impact on the profitability of the activity

of T-Solar and constitute an expropriation of a substantial part of the value and

215

returns of the Claimants’ investment.”’” The legislative amendments by Spain have

reduced the profitability of the plants subject to RD 1578/2008 by 10% (from
9,41% to 8,48%) and plants subjected to RD 661/2007 by 8,5% (from 7,36% to
6,72%), such a loss is considered severe in the business environment.7!

285. Moreover, the Claimants submit that such measures have not been taken for a
purpose which is in the public interest, are discriminatory, in the case of RDL

accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.”!”

In this regard, the Claimants claim that it is not necessary to prove the bad faith of
the State, but that the essential element is the effect suffered by the investment.”'*

The Claimants reject that the changes were justified to correct the tariff deficit
caused by energy producers under the special regime.”!” The deficit has existed
long before, and the real reason lies with the Spanish Government that for
economic, social and electoral policy reasons has not taken the necessary measures
to implement the principle of tariff sufficiency and now pretends to apply a
principle of “sustainability or economic and financial stability.”°*? The measures
taken by the government are hasty and improvised and have caused great
instability.?”!

In addition, the tariff deficit cannot justify the breach by Spain of the ECT by
failing to provide a prompt, adequate and effective compensation following
expropriation as the ECT does not include provisions of “state of necessity”, and,
in any case, the Respondent has not claimed such defence.”””

The Claimants submit that the transfer of wealth is one of the most visible elements
that allows expropriation to be identified, and in the present case such a transfer of
wealth has occurred when the Spanish government finances the deficit in electricity
tariffs through coercive measures against the Claimants and other photovoltaic
producers.”

The Claimants add that the Respondent’s actions are permanent as there is no
prospect that Spain would rectify its measures and that Claimants’ losses should be

considered final.”

b) Breach of fair and equitable treatment contrary to Article 10(1) of
the ECT

291. According to the Claimants, the standard of fair and equitable treatment of the ECT
is broad and flexible and gives the tribunal a wide margin of appreciation to analyse
the just character of the acts of the States.””°

292. — Since this is a specific obligation of an international treaty, it is not necessary for
the Tribunal to establish that there was a breach of Spanish law in order to conclude
that the conduct of Spain breached its duty to provide fair and equitable
treatment.””° Moreover, the determination of bad faith is not necessary either to
assess the violation of the standard.’

293. The Claimants submit that the standard of fair and equitable treatment requires the
maintenance of a stable and predictable legal framework, which derives from the
wording of Article 10(1) of the ECT, referring to an obligation to “encourage and
create stable [...] conditions”? for investors of other contracting parties to make
their investments. This requirement has also been recognised by various arbitral

229

tribunals,“ and it is the premise of protection of legitimate expectations of

investors that has become a central element of the obligation to provide fair and
equitable treatment?”

294. Specifically, the Claimants claim that Spain violated the standard of fair and
equitable treatment frustrating legitimate expectations of the Claimants by
breaking the stability of the regulatory framework under which they invested.

295. The Claimants allege that legitimate expectations are violated when the host State

makes commitments and representations or adopts a line of action, on which the

Even in the absence of specific commitments, the investor’s expectations are

frustrated when the host State performs acts incompatible with criteria for

economic rationality, the public interest or the principle of rationality.?*?

296. According to the Claimants, the formation of legitimate expectations does not
require the existence of a stabilisation clause in a contract, and the precedents cited
by the Respondent in this regard are irrelevant as they refer to different
circumstances and have been cited only partially.”*> In fact, the main element that
defines legitimate expectations of an investor is the legal framework in force at the

facility in operation, which allowed the producer to calculate compensation with a

high degree of certainty.~° These rules, being directed at a specific and limited

group of investors that fulfilled the requested requirements within the established
time limits, constituted specific commitments of Spain.?*°

prevented producers from turning to the market, guaranteeing compensation for
entire production throughout the lifetime of the installation.”*”

The Claimants submit that in addition to legislation the Government of Spain
promoted investment in this sector through various publicity. In particular, the
Claimants submit that presentation “The Sun Can be Yours 2005” announced that
returns on investment in the photovoltaic sector could reach up to 15%, and that
there were possibilities of funding by the Institute for Diversification and Energy
Saving (“IDEA”) and Instituto de Crédito Oficial (“ICO”).?** The prospectus
“The Sun Can be Yours 2007” announced that there were two types of regulated
tariffs, one for the first 25 years and another for a period thereafter.”

Spain’s strategy to attract investment worked and the Government reached its
objectives, but thereafter the Spanish Government changed its objectives and
turned to concentrate on the reduction of the tariff deficit, completely altering the
economic balance of the regime and frustrating the legitimate expectations of
investors.”

The Claimants deny that the only expectation that the Spanish legislation allowed
for investors was to obtain reasonable profitability as provided in Article 30.4 of
the LSE as this reasonableness was an indeterminate and empty concept that could
be defined at anytime by the Government. According to the Claimants, reasonable

compensation was precisely specified in the regulations.”"!

In effect, by reading
Article 30.4 it cannot be discarded that the reception of reasonable rates of
profitability constituted the limit of offered profitability, neither was it the sole
element of the State offer, nor this criteria would condition or annul later conditions
offered by the State.” In reality, the concept of reasonable profitability was only
defined in RDL 9/2013."

According to the Claimants, it is not true that Spain’s measures corresponded to
the implicit limits of the regime. Nothing has established that the lifespan of
facilities would be less than 30 years as imposed by RD 1565/2010. On the

contrary, and according to the report by Deloitte, the average lifespan of facilities

imposed by RDL 14/2010 was also absent from the PER 2005-2010, which only
referred to standard cases as reference and not to maximum limits.“

The Claimants submit that the right to the regulated tariff was not a mere
expectation but a right that was consolidated in the investment of the owner of the
facility when it complied with all the requirements in the legislation and obtained
registration of the facility with the RAIPRE.”“°

According to the Claimants, the tariff deficit or the fact that Spain was going
through a difficult economic situation, apart from problems caused by the Spanish
Government itself, do not exempt Spain from complying with the ECT or from
payment of compensation for the damage caused.”“”

©) Breach of duty to provide effective means for the assertion of claims
and the enforcement of rights with respect to investments contrary to
Article 10(12) of the ECT
308. The Claimants submit that the obligation provided in Article 10(12) of the ECT is
not a mere reformulated prohibition of denial of justice, but that it incorporates a

different and less strict test than the latter.?**

What is required by the standard in
Article 10(12) of the ECT is that the State not only provides investors with a
mechanism to enforce their rights, but also that this mechanism is useful or
effective.>*°

309. According to the Claimants, Spain breached Article 10(12) of the ECT by resorting
to the exceptional deployment of the Royal Decree-Law to introduce time
restrictions on the right to benefit from the regulated tariffs in conformity with RD
661/2007.7*°

310. The use of a Royal Decree-Law (“RDL”) — RDL 14/2010 — was not justified by a
situation of extreme urgency, as it is required, as the situation of alleged tariff
deficit predates the measure and also the content of RDL 14/2010 is very similar
to RD 1614/2010, adopted a few days before, and for which it was preferred to use
the form of a Royal Decree in regards to the photovoltaic sector, as opposed to the
consensus reached by the Government with wind, solar, thermal and co-generation
energy producers concerned with RD 1614/2010.2*7

311. According to the Claimants, the true intention of the Respondent when resorting to
this legal form was to avoid the proceeding of public inquiry required for
implementation of regulations, and prevent the Claimants from accessing ordinary

2
courts to challenge these measures.”**

In this regard, the Claimants deny the
Respondent’s arguments that the Royal Decree-Laws also allow for effective
challenge procedures, as the inherent limits to such procedures do not permit a
comprehensive judicial assessment of the RDL equivalent to the assessment of a

contentious-administrative proceeding, and, therefore, do not respect the

fundamental right to effective judicial protection required by the Spanish
Constitution and Article 10(12) of the ECT.2

312. The Claimants cannot directly challenge a legal norm before the courts and must
wait until the implementing administrative acts are issued, taking into account that
the approval of the definitive liquidation for the 2010 exercise was delayed until
September 2014 and that it is unknown when the settlements regarding the 2011,

2012 and 2013 exercises, relevant to this arbitration, will be approved.”

3. Damages

313. | The Claimants allege to have suffered damages as a result of Spain’s violations of
(a) Article 13 of the ECT, (b) Article 10(1) of the ECT, and (c) Article 10(12) of
the ECT. The Claimants also argue that (d) the proposed methodology for
calculating damages is appropriate, and (e) the Respondent cannot take advantage
of its own regulatory uncertainty to avoid compensating investors. Finally, the
Claimants submit that (f) RDL 9/2013 does not affect the calculation of damages

and also (g) claim interest on the damages caused.
a) Damages for breach of Article 13 of the ECT — Expropriation

314. Regarding expropriation, the Claimants submit that, pursuant to Article 13(1) of
the ECT, Spain is obliged to pay compensation in a prompt, adequate and effective
form with an equivalent amount “of fair market value of the investment
expropriated at the time immediately before the announcement of the expropriation
became known, or the intent to carry out the expropriation as to affect the value of
the investment.”*°!

315. Therefore, the Respondent must compensate the Claimants with a sum equivalent
to the fair market value of the investment immediately before the publication in the
BOE of RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010, i.e. 24 December 2010.7

316. The calculation of fair value is the difference between the expected value of cash
flow by the equity of the Claimants’ investments in T-Solar, on the basis of RD
661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 (“counter-factual hypothesis”) and the actual cash
flow value of the equity (“real hypothesis”).

According to the Claimants, the fair market value of the investment expropriated
amounts to [...] in respect of Charanne and [...] in respect of Construction, after

deduction of taxes.”

b) Damages for breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT — Fair and equitable
treatment

The Claimants submit that in the absence of a specific standard for remedies for
breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT, the general principle of international law of full
reparation must be applied, so that the reparation removes all consequences of the
unlawful act and put the party in the situation in which it would have been had the
damage not occurred.2™
According to the Claimants, the approval of RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010
caused a drop in cash flow for T-Solar and its subsidiaries, and a loss of value of
the Claimants’ shares in these companies.”°>
As in the case of expropriation, the Claimants calculate the amount of damages as
the difference between the value of expected of cash flow by the equity of the
Claimants in T-Solar on the basis of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 (counter-
factual hypothesis) and the actual cash flow value of the equity (real hypothesis).”°

therefore, Spain must compensate the Claimants for the damage caused by RDL
14/2010, which has been calculated by the Claimants’ expert as [...] for Charanne

d) The focus of the Claimants’ expert is correct

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s arguments must be dismissed as in the
calculation of the damages the “reasonable return rate” was not taken into account
which would be the threshold under which investors could claim damages.”
According to the Claimants, the concept of “reasonable return rate” had not been
determined in the applicable legal framework, in which profitability of the projects
came determined by its own characteristics, without the existence of any rules that
limited through a rate of specific percentage profitability of the projects.°”°
The Claimants submit that the calculation of damages should be therefore based
both on the loss of the investment’s economic value, and the discounted cash flow
method used by the expert of Deloitte as this is the most appropriate method.?”
Although the discussion concerning the TIR is irrelevant, Deloitte established that
the TIR of the Claimants’ projects was reasonable and that from the normative
changes onwards the TIR of the projects have been reduced without exception?”
Regarding the Respondent’s criticism on the use of exaggerated CAPEX and
OPEX values in calculation of the impact of the new legislation as done by
Deloitte, the Claimants, after denying the allegation, point out that even if the data
on costs was flawed it would still be irrelevant because in the end the same costs
apply in both hypotheses, real and counter-factual, therefore, the impact of the
alleged error would be set off?”

e) Spain cannot benefit from the uncertainty caused by its own actions

to limit compensation

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s argument, according to which the
uncertainty of the price market for electricity in the future prevents the Claimants’
calculation of damages, is inadmissible and should be rejected because it would
compensate the Respondent for its breaches of the ECT and for maintaining a
normative instability?“
The Claimants assert that their evaluation is based on the predictions that would be

made by a theoretical buyer and a theoretical seller to establish the market value of

equity in T-Solar, and that it is for the violating State to support the risk of an

abnormal behaviour of the market that could undermine these predictions.””>
Sf) RDL 9/2013 has no impact on the damages suffered by the Claimants

According to the Claimants, although RDL 9/2013 completely repealed the
previous regime of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, and is not the focus of this
arbitration, the new legislation did not offset the damage caused by the 2010 norms,
but, on the contrary, has aggravated the situation further. Therefore, RDL 9/2013
has no impact on the assessment of damages made by the Claimants which in any
case subsequently worsened.?”°

Regarding expropriation, Article 13(1) of the ECT provides that the assessment
should be made “immediately before the Expropriation or impending
Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the
Investment.” The expropriation was carried out in late 2010 and consequently RDL
9/2013, approved in July 2013, does not affect this valuation.?””

With respect to the breach of duty to accord fair and equitable treatment, Article
10(1) of the ECT does not specify the valuation date, but according to the general
principles of international law and the position of the Respondent itself, this
valuation should be made at the date of the award.’”*

As for the damage suffered by the Claimants from the entry into force of the
relevant legislation until 14 July 2013 (entry into force of RDL 9/2013) (historical
damage), the Claimants allege that damages amount to [...] for Charanne and [...]
for Construction, for a total of [...]?”

The Claimants finally insist that there is no risk of double recovery, because in this
arbitration it is only the impact of RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 which have
been assessed, while in the other ongoing arbitration proceedings no claims are
based on these two specific laws. Regarding the alleged absorption of the previous
norms by the new regulatory framework, the Respondent has not conclusively

demonstrated how and why such an absorption would occur.”*°

g) Interest

335. Considering that the breaches of the ECT by Spain have prevented the Claimants
from the opportunity to invest the amounts from which they were deprived, the
Claimants claim interests on the damages. Such interests shall be calculated from
the date of entry into force of the measures to the date when the Kingdom of Spain
pays to the Claimants the amount, if any, determined in an eventual award.”*!

336. The Claimants submit that they could have obtained a return of 7,398%, which is
the rate corresponding to the currently reasonable return guaranteed by Spain in

RD 413/2014 of 6 June.”
B. The Respondent

337. | The Respondent asserts that regulatory adjustments made by Spain through RD
1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 are reasonable changes carried out in the public
interest, in a non-discriminatory manner, proportionate to the interest they aim to
protect, and in compliance with due process.”*?

338. The Respondent affirms that Spain (1) did not expropriate the Claimants’
investment, (2) neither violated the obligation to provide fair and equitable
treatment, (3) nor breached its obligation to provide investors with effective ways
to assert their rights. For the above reasons, (4) the Respondent submits that no

damages have been caused to the Claimants.
1. The Respondent did not expropriate the investments of the Claimants

339. | According to the Respondent, what the Claimants in reality argue is that Spain
would have expropriated their “right to obtain a regulated tariff for the entire
lifespan of the facility’?** however, this alleged right cannot qualify as an
investment protected under Article 1(6) of the ECT as it defined “investment” as

assets “owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor’, and the

Claimants cannot, under Spanish law, control or own future returns they expected

to receive as they constitute mere expectations and not rights incorporated to their
patrimony.”*°

340. In this regard, the Respondent claim that a distinction must be drawn between legal
provisions that simply grant ordinary rights and the so-called ‘acquired rights’,

which imply a special title of acquisition.** Spanish law, which must be

287

considered to determine what rights may be expropriated,’ establishes that the

right to a tariff under the regime established by a regulation is not an acquired right
and its modification by the State is perfectly legitimate without compensation.”**

341. — Inparticular, the Respondent allege that registration with the RAIPRE is simply an
administrative requirement to operate and sell energy, and did not imply that the
registered facilities had acquired an infinite right to receive a certain
compensation.”

342. The Respondent also argues, based on various decisions of other arbitral

290

tribunals,” that the changes undertaken by Spain are an expression of the

sovereign power of the State to regulate and do not constitute measures tantamount
to expropriation, as they fall within the normal exercise of the State’s powers, they
were not discriminatory, were adopted in good faith, in accordance with due
process, and are proportionate with the aim of protecting the public interest by
preventing the collapse of the Spanish electricity system.”*' In this regard, the
Respondent submits that, by quoting the Santa Elena award,”” the Claimants refer

to an old position according to which one must only consider the economic effects,

but that position has been superseded, and it is now argued that the nature, purpose

and character of the measure in question shall also be considered.””>

343. The regulatory changes also do not comply with the requirements elaborated in
several arbitral decisions in determining whether the effects of a measure are
tantamount to an expropriation: the substantial deprivation of the economic use and
enjoyment of the investment, the irreversible or permanent character of the
measure, and the substantial scope of the economic damage.” The changes did
not involve cessation of operations, takeover of control of the shares or
management of T-Solar, nor permanent destruction of its value, moreover, they
were made to benefit the society, and did not imply a transfer of profits or assets to
the Government of Spain or to a private entity.?°°

344. Even if one admits that there was an impact, and that the damage alleged by the
Claimants is real, such damage is not sufficiently significant to conclude that the
measures are tantamount to expropriation.°°

the Respondent asserts that there is no jurisprudence or doctrine that supports such
a view, and that in any case the precedents on which the Claimants rely do not
support their position.?°”

a) The applicable standard

With respect to the standard of fair and equitable treatment, the Respondent
opposes the Claimants’ interpretation, as it considers that it reflects an extensive
trend that could impose unrealistic demands on States.””” Instead, the Respondent
suggests that a balanced assessment must be struck between the legitimate interest
of the State to regulate its own legal order and the interest of foreign investors
regarding the investment.*”

The Respondent asserts that the standard of fair and equitable treatment implies
reasonableness and must be considered in the context of this element. In addition,
although the standard includes the assessment of legitimate and reasonable
expectations that an investor had when undertaking its investment,”! it is not
reduced to this component, which is not even mentioned in Article 10(1) of the
ECT,*” but a balanced approach must be sought between reasonable expectations

of an investor and the exercise of regulatory powers, among others, of the State.*”?

b) The measures taken by the Kingdom of Spain were reasonable and
predictable
In relation to the changes introduced by RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010, on
which the Claimants’ claims are based, the Respondent makes the following
observations.
The limitation of the right to the regulated tariff to 30 years coincides with the

average operational lifespan of the facility,*™*

since for it to last longer it would be
necessary to carry out “substantial changes” on the facility which, in accordance
with the applicable law, would make them lose benefits under RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008.°°° In addition, and for the same reason, contracts for use of land
on which the Claimants’ plants are located also have terms not exceeding 30
years,*” therefore limiting the benefit of the regulated tariff to the first thirty years

in reality would not have any practical consequences.*””

352. The requirement to cover voltage surges is a coherent and reasonable rule as it is
aimed at preventing the technical collapse of the system contributing to enhanced
security and better management.*°*

353. As for the limitations of the equivalent hours imposed by RDL 14/2010, these
limitations were based on production forecasts that were made in PER 2005-
2010° and were taken into account by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 to
calculate compensation for the plants and, consequently, are neither unexpected
nor unreasonable.*'° In this regard, the Respondent also asserts that already in RD
661/2007 the geographical areas by sun exposure table has been already noted.*"!

354. Finally, the requirement to pay a charge of 0,5 Euro cents for the use of the
transportation and distribution network was not invented by Spain as such, but was

directly authorised by the European Regulation EU 774 of 2 September 2010.°!
©) Regarding the Claimants’ alleged legitimate expectations

355. | The Respondent contends that although the standard of fair and equitable treatment
provides that a stable regulatory framework must be granted to investments, this
does not imply that a legal system should be frozen, as the obligation of fair and

equitable treatment is not equivalent to a stabilisation clause and States can

313

continue to legislate to respond to changing circumstances,” what is forbidden is

that the States acts in inequitable and unreasonable manner when legislating.*!*

356. Spain argues that the adjustments to the legislative framework were legitimate,
coherent and reasonable to adapt to changing economic circumstances and solve
the problem of tariff deficit. In addition, incentives previously envisaged for
photovoltaic producers have not been changed, including the system of regulated
tariffs and its value for 30 years, the possibility of selling all their production in a

prioritised manner, and the system of access to public loans of the ICO.*'°

357. | The Respondent alleges, based on various arbitral decisions, that in order to invoke
the violation of legitimate expectations it is necessary that a specific commitment

of the State exists,*!°

and Spain never undertook specific commitments to the
Claimants that would guarantee them the freezing of the compensation scheme of
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.°"”

358. According to the Respondent, Article 40 of RD 463/2004 did not immobilise the
regulatory framework applicable to electricity production through renewable
sources, in fact this norm was subsequently modified by RD 661/2007, and the
Spanish Supreme Court had the opportunity to comment on these regulatory
changes, confirming their legality and establishing, in particular, that there is no
right to an unaltered maintenance of the economic regime for receipt of premiums
and that modification of the regime is possible within the framework of the LSE
without affecting legal security and legitimate confidence.*!*

359. According to the Respondent, Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 cannot serve as the
basis for the Claimants’ stabilisation expectation, as it does not refer to the subjects
that were modified in 2010. Article 44.3 refers to the future revisions of the amount
of the tariffs not to affect facilities under this Decree. However, the provisions of
RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 did not modify the regulated tariffs; the former

established a time limit for their perception and RDL 14/2010 set a limit for sale

   

hours under the tariff. But the regulated tariff, as set in the table of Article 36 of

RD 661/2007, was not modified by these later regulations.*"°

commitment with a stabilisation effect. Apart from the fact that the validity and

efficacy of stabilisation clauses are highly contested,*”° they must be interpreted

Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 cannot be compared to such a clause as it is a

or commitments of the State not to exercise its legislative authority.*°

As for the other advertising documents, the Respondent asserts that they can not
give rise to legitimate expectations as they do not contain specific commitments.
The Claimants cited isolated fragments of presentations called “The Sun Can Be
Yours” of May 2005 and November 2008, but omitted to refer to the specific
presentation made in June 2007 regarding RD 661/2007, from which it can be seen
that there was a departure from the premise that the plants would operate 25 years
producing 1,250 hours per year, and that in these terms a plant would be able to

recoup their investment in 10 years and earn an TIR of 8,29%.°74

With regard to the document “Renewables Made in Spain” °5

3. Spain did not breach Article 10(12) of the ECT

369. The Respondent affirms that Article 10(12) of the ECT requires the host State to
establish an appropriate system of laws and institutions which operate effectively,
and argues that this requirement should be evaluated in accordance with an
objective international standard.**” The Respondent also argues that although the
standard does not require that domestic remedies are exhausted, it is necessary that
the means made available to the investor are used.

370. The Claimants’ claim refers to the use of an RDL, RDL 14/2010 to regulate the
subject, as it would have deprived them from the possibility to assert their rights

371. In this regard, the Respondent submits that Royal Decree-Laws are legal
instruments which are usually used in systems of constitutional monarchy, such as
the Spanish system, and are subject to strict conditions, controls and limitations.*4
In this case, the use of RDL 14/2010 was justified under the circumstances.***

372. Either way, according to the Respondent, the use of a RDL does not prevent the
Claimants from utilising the mechanisms envisaged under the Spanish legal system
to challenge these norms. In particular, the Spanish system offers two routes for
challenging an RDL, the constitutionality question, which is an indirect claim that
can be raised during legal proceedings, to request that the Constitutional Court
rules on the constitutionality of a norm,” and the action in investment liability that
allows any person that has sustained damage as a consequence of the operation of
a public service, to request compensation, firstly, before the administration and, if

necessary, before the contentious-administrative courts.*4”

The Respondent argues that (a) the Claimants’ claim for damages has become
without a subject matter, and (b) that the period 2010-2013 cannot be considered
in isolation. In alternative, the Respondent argues that (c) the Claimants have failed

to prove the existence of damage and its quantum.
a) The claim for damages has become without subject matter

The Claimants’ claim is based on RDL 14/2010 and RD 1565/2010, however, these
regulatory changes remained without effect after the approval of RDL 9/2013.>%*
RDL 9/2013 has established a new compensation system, different from the
previous one, determining a new regulatory framework.*”

The Respondent submits therefore that the Claimants’ claim and its estimates of
damages are based on regulations that have been repealed and, thus, lack any
sense.*’ Any calculation made in this respect would be theoretical, false and
unjust as the remuneration of the Claimants’ facilities is now governed by RDL
9/2013.°°!

b) The 2010-2013 period cannot be considered in isolation

According to the Respondent, considering that RDL 9/2013 completely absorbed
all previous regulatory charnges, it is impossible to make any calculation of
compensation for plants under the RD 661/2007, RD 1578/2008, RD 1565/2010 or
RDL 14/2010 without taking the new regulations into account.

Accordingly, the Respondent quotes its own experts in this arbitration (Mac Group
- Altran), who indicated “we have come to the conclusion that the period 2010-

Jored in isol;

2013 cannot be considered in ibl

impact of latory

measures, as its effect is taken into account when providing an adequate

©) Claimants did not prove damage nor quantum

According to the Respondent, the expert reports on which the Claimants’ claims
for damages are based are incomplete, partial and erroneous and, therefore, are
ineffective in determining quantum.>**

In particular, the reports do not explain nor justify that damage has occurred, but

assume damage as an established fact.**> The damage has not been proven as it

depends on a variable that cannot be determined with certainty, i.e. the future
market price of the electricity market.>*°

Moreover, the reports contain information contradicting other documents filed by
the Claimants and publicly available information.**’

The methodological approach used by the Claimants is incorrect since it is based
on cash flow values in absolute terms and does not take into account the reasonable
profitability rate threshold, which could be used to claim damages in the case that
the cash flow is calculated according to it.**

With respect to the alleged damage caused by the established 30 years maximum
term for receiving the regulated tariff, the Respondent contends that it could not
have caused damage to the Claimants as it coincides with the end of the facilities’
lifespan, and in order to extend the lifespan of these facilities it would be necessary
to implement significant changes which in any way would preclude them from the
possibility of benefiting from the regulated tariffs regime.**’ For this reason the
contracts concluded by the Claimants for the use of land where the facilities are
located have a term of less than 30 years.*

The Respondent submits that the change in terms of limited time periods to receive
the regulated tariff actually benefits the Claimants, as in the case of facilities
covered by RD 661/2007, the previously regulated tariff would be reduced by 80%
from year 26, whereas it now extends to 30 years, and consequently the facilities

are entitled to the full rate for a longer period.**!

385. | Moreover, leaving out the plants’ lifespan, in any case, the loss would result from
the difference between the regulated tariff and the market price, nevertheless, it is
impossible to know in advance what will be the market price in 2037.5

386. With respect to the limit of equivalent hours of production, the Respondent
contends that the calculation of the alleged damage that would cause this limitation
is argumentative because after exceeding the limit, the plants can continue to sell
their electricity at market price, and that price is variable and unknown in the
future.** Either way, the Respondent contends that although the hour limitation
would affect plants, it allows investors to continue receiving a reasonable profit
that is the threshold guaranteed by the regulatory framework.

387. For the above mentioned reasons, the Respondent contends that the damage alleged
by the Claimants is merely speculative because it depends on variations of the
market price of electricity in Spain which, as a volatile parameter, can not be
predicted for 20 years in advance, and also assumes a productivity over the time
limitations provided in RDL 14/2010 without considering the physical erosion of
the facilities.

388. Being entirely uncertain and totally speculative, the alleged damage is not
compensable in accordance with decisions of other international investment
tribunals.*%

Respondent contends that there is no causal link between the actions of the State
and these costs, which are the result of decisions of the project promoter and the
financial entity.*”

VII. RELIEF SOUGHT
A. The Claimants

392. The Claimants request the Arbitral Tribunal to:
1. Declare that Spain has breached its international obligations under Part III of
the ECT; in particular, Spain:
a) expropriated the investments of the Claimants without payment of a
prompt, fair, adequate and effective compensation, in violation of
Article 13 of the ECT;
b) breached its obligation to provide the investments of the Claimants
fair and equitable treatment, in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT;
and

7,398% calculated from 4 March 2011 until full payment for violation of Article
10(12) of the ECT;

Grant any other relief it deems appropriate; and

Order Spain to pay all costs and expenses incurred in this arbitration, including
the costs and fees of the Arbitral Tribunal and the Arbitration Institute of the
SCC; also, to order Spain to reimburse the Claimants all the expenses incurred

as a result of this arbitration, including lawyers’ and experts’ fees.

B. The Respondent

393.

The Respondent requests the Tribunal to:

1.

Reject the Claimants’ claims as inadmissible since the arbitration has become
redundant;

Dismiss the Claimants’ claims for lack of jurisdiction;

. Alternatively, and in the event that the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction

to hear the present dispute, to dismiss all the claims of the Claimants on the

merits since Spain did not breach the ECT in any way;

. Alternatively, to dismiss all financial claims of the Claimants on the basis that

they have not suffered damage as a consequence of the adaptations carried out
by Spain; and

Order the Claimants to pay all costs and expenses arising from this arbitration,
including administrative expenses incurred by the European Commission, the
arbitrators’ fees and fees for legal representation of Spain, their experts and
advisers, including a reasonable rate of interest from the date on which these

costs occurred until the date of actual payment.

Ix. ANALYSIS BY THE TRIBUNAL

A. Jurisdiction

394.

In the last prayer for relief, the Respondent requests, first, that the Claimants’

claims should be dismissed as inadmissible since arbitration has become without

object and, second, that the Tribunal declares that it lacks jurisdiction over the

present dispute. The Arbitral Tribunal considers, however, that the Respondent’s

argument regarding the inadmissibility for supervening lack of purpose is an issue

www.menachambers.com 88

Translation by Mena Chambers

that should be treated as a matter of substance. Indeed, the Tribunal cannot enter
into a discussion if the object of the dispute disappeared without having jurisdiction
over it.

395. Before commencing the discussion on jurisdiction, it is worth recalling that the
Claimants have limited the subject of this dispute to the alleged unlawful nature of
RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 (“the 2010 norms”) and decided to exclude from
their claims RD 9/2013 and subsequent legislation.*”! Thus, the claims have been
limited to the consequences of the 2010 norms, while complaints regarding the
subsequent norms have been submitted by different companies of their group to
another arbitral tribunal.

396. | The Respondent has structured its submissions regarding jurisdiction as three main
arguments that we will examine: (1) that the Claimants have renounced the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal by triggering the fork in the road provision, (2) that the
Claimants, being entirely controlled by nationals of the Kingdom of Spain, are not
investors in accordance with Article 1(7) of the ECT, and (3) that the Arbitral
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear a dispute between European investors against a
European State subject to the regulatory regime of the EU. The Tribunal will
examine each of these arguments in turn.

397. Before turning to the analysis of these arguments, the Arbitral Tribunal recalls that

in its Defence,”

the Respondent argued that the Claimants had failed to prove that
they are investors and that they have made protected investments under the terms
of the ECT, as the Claimants had not submitted official certificates or incorporation
documents of the companies to certify their existence, nationality and ownership
of these investments. This argument has been abandoned by the Respondent as the
Claimants have provided the requested documentation and proved the existence,
nationality and ownership of the companies. Therefore, in the latest submissions
of the Respondent, there is no objection as to the existence of a protected
investment in recent writings of the Respondent. In any case, the Arbitral Tribunal
considers that the Claimants have provided satisfactory evidence of the existence,

nationality and ownership of Charanne B.V. and Construction Investment S.A.R.L.

as well as the existence of a protected investment within the meaning of Article

1(6) of the ECT.*”

. Fork in the Road provision:

398. The Respondent alleges that the Claimants have activated the fork in the road
provision of Article 26(2)(a) and (b) of the ECT by presenting two contentious-
administrative claims (No. 60-2011 and No. 64-2011) before the Supreme Court in
relation to RD 1565/2010 and the European Court of Human Rights (“ECHR”) in
relation to RDL 14/2010.

399. The Claimants deny that the conditions for activating the fork in the road provision
have been met in this case in the absence of the triple identity test of parties, object
and legal basis between the proceedings before the Supreme Court and the ECHR,
and the present Arbitral Tribunal is not met.

400. Article 26(2) of the ECT allows the affected investor to choose a forum to submit
a dispute under the ECT to (i) the ordinary or administrative courts of the
Contracting Party involved in the dispute; or (ii) in accordance with a previously
agreed dispute settlement procedure, or (iii) in accordance with the following
paragraphs of Article 26(2), in particular, an arbitration proceeding administered
by the Institute.*” But Article 26(3)(b)(i) excludes the consent of the parties to
submit their disputes to arbitration in accordance with Article 26(4) in the event
that the affected investor has previously resorted to the ordinary or administrative
courts of the party involved in the dispute or in accordance with the previously
agreed dispute settlement procedure.

401. Based on the above, in order for the fork in the road provision to be triggered, it is
necessary that the investor has opted to submit the dispute to be resolved in
conformity with one of the mechanisms identified in Article 26(2)(a) or (b) of the
ECT.*’> From this it can be deduced, necessarily, that it applies condition of
identity of the parties. For the fork in the road provision of Article 26 to apply, it
is necessary that the investor that has previously submitted the same dispute to
arbitration in accordance with Article 26(4), has previously opted to submit the

same dispute for resolution to one of the mechanisms provided for in Article

Translation by Mena Chambers

26(2)(a) or (b). The terms of the ECT are clear and neither of the Parties have
alleged that they must be interpreted.

402. The first question, therefore, that the Tribunal must analyse is whether the
Claimants have chosen to submit their dispute to one of the mechanisms provided
for in Article 26(2)(a) or (b).

403. It is not in dispute in this regard that the Claimants in this arbitration are different
from the claiming parties before the Spanish Supreme Court and the ECHR.
Indeed, the proceedings before the Supreme Court were initiated by the T-Solar
Group and Isolux Corsan together with the Spanish companies owners of the
plants, and the procedure brought before the ECHR was initiated by various
subsidiaries of T-Solar.

404. | The Respondent submits, however, that the absence of identity between the parties
in different procedures should not prevent the application of the fork in the road
provision based on a flexible interpretation of the triple identity test developed by
some recent decisions of international tribunals.*”* According to the argument put
forward by the Kingdom of Spain, the Tribunal should only examine the “essence”

of the claims*””

to determine whether the same dispute has been submitted to both
forums.

405. According to the Arbitral Tribunal, for the fork in the road provision in Article
26(3)(b)(i) to apply, it is above all necessary that the investor has previously
resorted to local courts or another previously agreed method of dispute settlement.
It follows from this provision that this investor is necessarily the investor affected
by the alleged illegal measure.

406. In this respect, the Respondent contends that, to assess whether there is identity of
the parties, the Tribunal should analyse the economic reality of the corporate
structure of the different entities present in the various procedures in question.
Indeed, if this was not the case “any claimant company could modify its corporate
structure, using intermediary companies, subsidiaries, and ultimately
restructuring its participation in the corporate chain, to justify inapplicability of
the triple identity test with regard to the identity of the party.”"* The Arbitral

Tribunal does not disagree with this analysis which, however, would apply if it was

demonstrated that the Claimants, on the one hand, and the companies T-Solar
Group and Isolux Corsan S.A. group, on the other hand, are in fact the same entity,
so that it may be considered that the actions brought before the Supreme Court and
the ECHR have been actually brought by the Claimants through intermediary
companies.

407. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that this demonstration has not been provided by
the Kingdom of Spain. In its Reply, the Claimants have argued that “both in the
date of the entry into force of RD 1565/2010 and the entry into force of RDL
14/2010, Charanne possessed a share in Tuin Zonne S.A. (now T-Solar Global S.A.
Group) representing 18,6583% of its social capital”, and that “both at the date of
the entry into force of RD 1565/2010 and the entry into force of RDL 14/2010,
Construction possessed a share in Tuin Zonne, S.A. (now T-Solar Global S.A.
Group) representing 2,8876% of its social capital.”*”

408. While it is true that the Claimants are part of the same group of the company Grupo
T-Solar and of the company Grupo Isolux Corsan S.A., this is insufficient to
consider that there is a substantial identity of the parties, even under a flexible
interpretation of the triple identity test. For that to be the case it would have been
necessary to demonstrate that the Claimants enjoy decision-making powers in
Grupo T-Solar and Grupo Isolux Corsan S.A. in such a way that these companies
have been in reality intermediary companies. This demonstration has not been
provided. Neither has it been alleged that the corporate structure of the group of
the claiming parties has been designed or modified with a fraudulent purpose to
allow the Claimants to avoid the fork in the road provision of the ECT. In the
absence of proof to that effect, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot consider that, in
accordance with Article 26 of the ECT, the Claimants have chosen to submit the
dispute to the Supreme Court or the ECHR.

409. Although this is sufficient to reject the jurisdictional objection based on the fork in
the road provision, the Tribunal adds that, as correctly submitted by the Claimants,
the ECHR cannot be considered as a court of the Contracting Party within the
meaning of Article 26(2)(a). Indeed, the Contracting Party to which Article
26(2)(a) refers is the respondent Contracting Party, in this case Spain. And there

is no doubt that the ECHR is not a court of the Kingdom of Spain. Neither can it

57° Reply, para. 378.

www.menachambers.com 92

Translation by Mena Chambers

be considered that the procedure before the ECHR is “a process of dispute
resolution previously agreed” within the meaning of Article 26(2)(b) of the ECT,
since there is no agreement between the parties to submit their dispute to the
ECHR.

410. Based on the above, the Tribunal rejects the objection to jurisdictional objection
based on the fork in the road provision of the ECT, without it being necessary to
examine the arguments of the Parties as to the subject identity and identity of legal
basis, since it would not change the decision of the Arbitral Tribunal in this respect,

not meeting the requirement to establish the identity of parties in the proceedings.

2. Claimants are not investors in accordance with Article 1(7) of the ECT

 

411. The Respondent alleges, first, (a) that the ultimate beneficiaries of the Claimants’
companies are Spanish nationals and that, therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction and, secondly, (b) that the resolution of the present dispute by the

Arbitral Tribunal would be contrary to the Spanish Constitution.
a) The actual Claimants are Spanish nationals

412. The Kingdom of Spain argues that the Claimants are two “empty shells” through
which two individuals of Spanish nationality, Mr José Gomis Cafiete and Mr Luis
Antonio Delso Heras “realise their investments”, and that “to allow Claimants to
benefit from the protections that the ECT offers to foreign investors would amount
to overlooking the aim sought by the instrument, that is no other than to protect
foreign investors, and not domestic investors that structure their investment in an
artificially complex manner.

413. The Respondent also argues, on the basis of Articles 26(1) and 1(7)(a), that “the
diversity of nationalities is a requirement under the ECT.”*' Although the
Claimants are Dutch and Luxembourg companies, the Respondent argues that “the
‘foreign’ nature of the legal entity is not a formal requirement, but an objective
condition that allows the arbitral tribunals to lift the corporate veil to determine
the real controller of the company.”

414. — The Arbitral Tribunal does not share the position of the Kingdom of Spain. The

protection provided by the ECT applies to investments made by an investor. The

Translation by Mena Chambers

quality of investor is defined in Article 1(7) of the ECT, in what concerns to legal
persons, like those that are “organized in accordance with the law applicable in
that Contracting Party”. There is no dispute as to the fact that the two Claimants
meet this requirement, as the Netherlands and Luxembourg are Contracting Parties
to the ECT. Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT does not contains any other requirement
but that the investor is constituted in accordance with the applicable law of the
Contracting Party, in this case, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

While it is perfectly conceivable to lift the corporate veil and ignore the legal
personality of an investor in the case of fraud directed at jurisdiction, as could be
an instrumental transfer of the assets of the investment after the emergence of the
dispute, there is no basis for importing to the ECT a general rule according to which
the nationality of the investor should be analysed according to an economic
criterion, when the ECT itself refers to the legal criterion of incorporation of the
company under the law of a Contracting Party. In the present case, the Respondent
party does not make any allegation nor proves a fraudulent nature in the structure
of the Claimants’ investments that could justify the lifting of the corporate veil.
To adopt the argument of Spain would amount to denial of benefits whenever an
investor, legal entity incorporated under the applicable law of a Contracting Party
in accordance with Article 1(7)(a)(ii), was controlled by citizens or nationals of the
State receiving the investment. However, the drafters of the ECT did not intend to
include this hypothesis in the denial of benefits clause of Article 17, which relates
to the situation of a legal entity controlled by shareholders of a third country (a
third country being a country not party to the ECT). Regardless of whether a denial
of benefits under Article 17 is a matter of merits or jurisdiction — question that the
Tribunal does not have to assess in this award — is an illustration of the fact that the
drafters of the ECT did not want to exclude from the scope of its application the
investors as legal entities controlled by nationals of the Contracting State receiving
the investment.

On a more general level, the Arbitral Tribunal shares the position taken under the
ECT by the tribunal in the Yukos case, according to which “the Tribunal knows of

no general principles of international law that would require investigating the

structure of a company or another organization when the applicable treaty simply
requires it to be organized in accordance with the laws of a Contracting Party.”
Based on the above, the Arbitral Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objections to
jurisdiction based on Article 1(7) of the ECT.

b) On the alleged breach of the Spanish Constitution that the decision

of this Tribunal would cause

The Kingdom of Spain submits that, if the Arbitral Tribunal finds it has
jurisdiction, the Spanish public order applicable to this arbitration would be
violated, and in particular, the principle of equality set out in Article 14 of the
Spanish Constitution as “it would make available to Spanish citizens (natural
persons owners of the shareholding of the claimants) a mechanism to resolve
disputes with certain procedural aspects (choice of the tribunal, application of a
more flexible procedural scheme) to which any other Spanish citizen would not
have access to.”**°
The Arbitral Tribunal does not agree with this argument.
Firstly, the competence of this Arbitral Tribunal has to be assessed under the ECT
and not in accordance with the national law of the Respondent. Therefore, the
Spanish public order, although it may be taken into account in resolving a dispute
in the merits stage, has little to do in determining the jurisdiction of this Tribunal
under an international treaty to which the Kingdom of Spain is a contracting party.
Secondly, as correctly pointed out by the Claimants, this argument is nothing more
than a different presentation of the argument, already rejected by the Arbitral
Tribunal, according to which the Claimants would actually be Spanish nationals
acting through “empty corporate shells.”
Thirdly, and in any event, it does not appear the Claimants’ resort to arbitration
provided for by the ECT would violate the principles of equality and the right to
effective judicial protection provided by Articles 14 and 24 of the Spanish
Constitution. Such principles, in fact, only ensure the right of any Spanish national
to equal access and effective protection by tribunals, and in no way prohibits

Spanish citizens from proceedings according to their own situation.

. The Dispute is an intra-EU dispute which is subject to the regulatory regime of the

EU

The Kingdom of Spain contends, relying in particular on the Amicus EC presented
by the European Commission on 19 January 2015, that “neither Spain nor the
Netherlands or Luxembourg have agreed that disputes under the ECT are to be
resolved through international arbitration in intra-EU context.”

First of all, the Arbitral Tribunal wishes to clarify that it has given the most careful
consideration to the Amicus EC, which it has found very useful. The Tribunal
wishes to thank the European Commission for it. However, the Tribunal recalls
that the European Commission is not party to these proceedings and, therefore, in
this award the Tribunal will only respond to the arguments of the Parties, in light,
of course, of the elements of reflection provided by the EC.

The jurisdictional objection of the Kingdom of Spain relies on three arguments:
firstly, (a) all the parties in this procedure are part of the same Regional Economic
Integration Organisation (“REIO”) and, therefore, there is no diversity of
territories. (b) Secondly, there is an implicit disconnection clause in the ECT for
intra-EU disputes. (c) Thirdly, EU law does not allow EU Member States to agree
to submit the present dispute to a dispute resolution mechanism different from the
envisaged by the EU. The Tribunal will examine each of these three arguments in

turn.
a) On the inexistence of diversity of territories

The Kingdom of Spain contends that the present dispute does not meet the
requirement of diversity of territories between the investor and the Contracting
Party provided in Article 26 of the ECT. The argument rests on the idea, expressed
with some clarity in the Amicus EC, that “investors of an EU Member State
requesting the settlement of a dispute with another Member State cannot be
considered investors of another contracting party within the meaning of Article 26,
paragraph I of the ECT’, because “the EU is a contracting party to the ECT and
investors of Member States of the EU are, for the purposes of the Charter, investors
of the EU.” The EC also underlines that “Article 10 paragraph 1, second
paragraph of the ECT provides that with respect to a REIO (i.e. the EU), the term

www.menachambers.com 96

Translation by Mena Chambers

territory will encompasses the territories of the member States of such an

organisation.”***

428. Based on Article 26 of the ECT, disputes between a Contracting Party and an
investor of another Contracting Party relating to an investment in the territory of
the former may be submitted to arbitration. It can be deduced that, as correctly
raised by the Kingdom of Spain, there must be a diversity of nationality between
the parties. The Arbitral Tribunal has already decided that the Claimants are legal
persons of the Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively, and not Spanish
investors. The issue that the Arbitral Tribunal has to resolve is whether, in the
context of this dispute, the Claimants can be considered as investors of the
Netherlands and Luxembourg respectively or whether they should be considered
as investors of the EU. In the latter case, since Spain is part of the EU, the dispute
would cease to oppose a contracting party and an investor of another contracting
party within the meaning of Article 26(1) of the ECT as it would be the case of an
investment by an investor of the EU in the territory of the EU.

429. In the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal, this argument ignores that, although the EU
is a Contracting Party of the ECT, the States that compose it have not ceased to be
Contracting Parties as well. Both the EU, as its Member States, may have legal
standing as Respondent in an action based on the ECT.

430. Article 1(10) of the ECT, in order to define the concept of “area” refers to both the
territory of the Contracting States (Article 1(10)(a)) and the EU territory (Article
1(10) second paragraph). Therefore, it appears reasonable to deduce that, in
referring to investments made “in the territory” of a contracting party, Article 26(1)
refers to both, in the case of a EU member State, to the territory of a national State
as well as the territory of the EU. There is no rule in the ECT according to which
a different interpretation can be inferred.

431. To know if the term “territory” refers to one or the other depends on the content of
the claim and the entity against which the claim is directed. An investor may well
sue the EU based on allegedly unlawful acts committed by it. In this case, it could
be considered that for the purposes of Article 26 of the ECT, the dispute is related
to an investment made in the territory of the EU. The Tribunal nonetheless does

not have to decide whether in that case jurisdiction in such circumstances would

exist under the ECT, as the present situation is completely different. In the present
case, claims are not based on EU actions, but on allegedly unlawful acts committed
by the Kingdom of Spain in the exercise of its national sovereignty. Nor is the
claim directed against the EU, or somehow implies that the EU should be held
responsible, thus, there is no doubt for the Arbitral Tribunal that Spain has a passive
legitimacy to act in this arbitration and therefore the territory to which Article 26(1)
of the ECT refers, for jurisdictional purposes, is the territory of the Kingdom of
Spain and not the territory of the EU.

432. Based on the above analysis, the Arbitral Tribunal finds that the dispute refers to
an investment made by investors from the Netherlands and Luxembourg in the
territory of the Kingdom of Spain. The Tribunal therefore rejects the objection

raised by the Respondent on the basis of Article 26 of the ECT.
b) The alleged implicit disconnection clause

433. The Kingdom of Spain, adopting the reasoning in Amicus EC, argues that the ECT
contains an “implicit disconnection clause for intra-EU relations.”**> The purpose
of this clause is to dissociate Member States, in relations inter se, from the ECT.

434. The argument is based, first of all, on a parallelism with Article 27 of the ECT.
Said Article provides for the possibility that a dispute between Contracting Parties
is to be submitted to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. Now it is true that, in accordance
with Article 267 TFEU and the Mox Plant decision of the European Court of
Justice, no dispute between EU Member States can be resolved by an ad hoc
arbitral tribunal, which would be according to Spain “further evidence of the
application of the implicit disconnection clause between EU Member States.”**°

435. However, this analogy does not seem to be relevant to this Arbitral Tribunal.
Article 27 of the ECT in fact expressly subjects the resort to arbitration between
Contracting Parties to the fact that they did not “agree otherwise.” The applicable
provision to the present dispute is, however, Article 26 of the ECT and not Article
27. However, no agreement to derogate from Article 26 exists in this case between
the States parties to the ECT, nor is there any agreement of this nature between the
Parties to this dispute. As for disputes between Member States, the prohibition of

submitting them to arbitration results from Article 267 TFEU, and there doe not

Translation by Mena Chambers

exist a similar provision that applies to a dispute between a private party and a
Member State of the EU.

Equally unconvincing is the argument of the Kingdom of Spain that there is a
custom union in the EU that would prove the existence of an implicit disconnection
clause in relation to Article 7 of ECT as the notion of transit can only apply in the
EU as a whole and not between Member States. However, this fact solely
demonstrates that Member States fulfil their obligations arising under Article 7 in
the framework of the European customs union. The existence of the EU does not
imply any contradiction or impediment to the full implementation by EU Member
States of their obligations under Article 7 of the ECT, thus, there is no need for an
implied disconnection clause.

The issue raised by the Respondent is, in the end, a matter of interpretation of the
ECT. Only through the interpretation of the treaty could the Arbitral Tribunal reach
the conclusion that the intention of the Contracting Parties was to include an
implicit disconnection clause. Any interpretation of the ECT should be made in
accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties
according to which the fundamental rule is an interpretation in good faith according
to the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context and taking into
account object and purpose of the treaty. However, the Arbitral Tribunal considers
that the terms of the treaty are clear and do not justify any additional interpretation
that could lead to reading into the ECT an implicit disconnection clause for intra-
EU disputes.

In reality, the Tribunal considers that the Contracting Parties to the ECT had no
need to agree on a disconnection clause, be either implicitly or explicitly. The role
of a disconnection clause would be, in effect, to resolve a conflict between the ECT
and the TFEU. However, there is no conflict between the two treaties. As stated
in previous sections of the present award, the competence of the Arbitral Tribunal
to decide on a claim filed by an investor of an EU Member State against another
EU Member State on the basis of the alleged illegal nature of the actions carried
out in the exercise of its national sovereignty, is perfectly compatible with the
participation of the EU as a REIO in the ECT. And, as we shall see in subsequent
sections of the present award, there is no rule of EU law which prevents EU

Member States to resolve through arbitration their disputes with investors from

www.menachambers.com 99

Translation by Mena Chambers

other Member States through arbitration. Nor is there any EU law rule that
prevents an arbitral tribunal to apply EU law to resolve such a dispute.

439. Having determined the above, the Arbitral Tribunal does not have to resolve the
arguments of the parties concerning Article 16 of the ECT. In fact, this rule would
be only relevant in the event of an inconsistency between the ECT and EU law.
The Tribunal is aware of the conclusion that was reached on this matter by the
tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary, according to which “from whatever perspective
the relationship between the ECT and EU Law is examined, the Tribunal concludes
that EU law would prevail over the ECT in case of any material inconsistency.”**"
However, as we will see in the following paragraphs, in the present case there is
no contradiction whatsoever between the ECT and EU law.

©) On the compatibility of the dispute resolution mechanism of the ECT
with EU Law

440. The Kingdom of Spain submits that Article 344 TFEU does not allow Member
States to resolve disputes relating to EU law through international arbitration. To
decide on this argument, the Tribunal must first examine (i) whether Article 344
TFEU is applicable to an investor-state arbitration and then, if it is applicable, (ii)
if the present dispute relates to the interpretation or application of the European
treaties within the meaning of Article 344. Finally, (iii) the Arbitral Tribunal will
examine whether there is any EU rule of public policy prohibiting the resolution of

this dispute through arbitration.

(i) Application of Article 344 TFEU to arbitration between
investors and EU Member States

441. In accordance with Article 344 TFEU, “Member States undertake not to submit a
dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method
of settlement other than those provided for therein”. Literally, this rule applies to
agreements relating to disputes between Member States, and not between a private
party and a Member State.

442. However, the Kingdom of Spain argues that “the fact that such consent to arbitrate
given by the Member State was accepted by another Member State or by an investor

is irrelevant. The offer to arbitrate would not be valid by application of Article

587 Electrabel v. Hungary, para. 4.191. Free translation: “from whatever perspective the relationship between the
ECT and EU Law is examined, the Tribunal concludes that EU law would prevail over the ECT in case of any
material inconsistency.”

344 TFEU.”*** The argument is based on a textual interpretation of Article 344.
According to the Respondent, “if Article 344 was restricted to state-state disputes,
it could have been clarified in the corresponding section ‘Member States undertake
not to submit disputes between Member States concerning the interpretation or
application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided
for therein’ [...] However [...] the contracting parties to the TFEU did not establish
such a distinction in Article 344 TFEU.”*® In other words, “the object and purpose
of Article 344 TFEU is that a Member State cannot be party to a dispute involving
State responsibility. If this dispute arises, this would inherently affect the
interpretation of European legislation and consequently should remain within the
jurisdiction of the European institutions”?

The Arbitral Tribunal does not find convincing the interpretation of Article 344
TFEU made by the Kingdom of Spain. If the Respondent’s argument was true, no
state tribunal could ever decide any issue that involved an interpretation of the
European treaties whenever the responsibility of a Member State would be at stake.
However, it is true that Member States are respondents in many proceedings before
national courts in which the interpretation or application of the European treaties
may come into play. Similarly, a Member State can agree to submit a dispute that
may involve issues of EU law to an arbitration. Finally, it is today universally
accepted that an arbitral tribunal not only has the power, but also the duty to apply
EU law”!

The scope of Article 344 TFEU cannot, therefore, be to prohibit Member States to
submit any dispute that could involve an interpretation of European treaties to a
dispute settlement proceedings other than those provided by EU framework. As
rightfully noted by the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary, the scope of Article 344
TFEU is more limited. This is to guarantee that the Court of Justice of the European

Union has the last word in interpretation of EU law to ensure its uniform

2

interpretation.*”? In this regard, Article 344 TFEU cannot be given the scope

argued by Spain since the Article should be viewed as one of the tools prohibiting

agreements of dispute resolution between Member States in order to ensure
harmonious application of EU law.

445. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary
also considered relevant that the European Union signed the ECT, thus, accepting
the possibility of arbitration between investors and Member States under Article
26° In this regard, it is relevant to note that the ECT does not allow

reservations.°**

(ii) Whether the present dispute concerns the interpretation or

application of the European treaties within the meaning of
Article 344

446. The Kingdom of Spain also contends that the present dispute relates to the
interpretation or application of the European treaties within the meaning of Article
344 TFEU because the ECT forms part of EU law. The Respondent bases this
argument on the decision in the Mox Plant case and argues that the ECT, being a
mixed agreement, has the same rank in the Community judicial order as other
Community agreements.***

447. Nevertheless, the Arbitral Tribunal does not have to rule on this argument for it has
already been decided that Article 344 TFEU does not apply to Investor-State

arbitration.

(iii) Whether there are any rules of European public order

prohibiting the Resolution of the present dispute through
arbitration

448. Apart from its arguments based on Article 344 TFEU, the Kingdom of Spain does
not identify in its submissions any rule of European public order prohibiting the
submission of a dispute between an investor and a Member State to arbitration. It
is appropriate to note that this case does not involve any assessment of the validity
of Community acts or decisions adopted by organs of the European Union and does
not concern in any way allegations by the European Union of violations of EU law
nor claims directed against such organisation. There is no argument in this
arbitration according to which the content of the laws at issue (in particular RD

661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 and/or the 2010 norms) would be contrary to EU law.

Beyond the arguments regarding the allegedly contrary character to EU law of the
submission of the dispute to arbitration (which have already been discussed and
resolved), the Kingdom of Spain has not argued that the decision rendered by this
Tribunal (whether it considers the demands in whole, in part or dismisses them)
could somehow violate the European judicial order.

449. It is true that, as the Respondent points out,>”° recently the European Commission
has recently decided to initiate a process of preliminary review of state aid, which
has extended to the compensation regime for renewable energy envisaged in RD
661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. However, and as pointed out by the Claimants,”
this initiative has not led to any decision so far. In any event, even if there is such
a problem, it would be a matter of public policy which the Arbitral Tribunal shall
take into account when deciding the dispute on the merits; and this would be for a
court to consider if the validity of the resultant Award is challenged.

450. Based on the above, the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute.
B. Merits

451. Firstly, the Tribunal will (1) review the Respondent’s argument on the
inadmissibility of arbitration by supervening lack of subject matter. Then, it will
analyse the Claimants’ claims regarding breach of (2) Article 13(1) of the ECT
(expropriation); (3) Article 10(12) of the ECT (obligation to provide effective
means for the assertion of claims), and (4) Article 10(1) of the ECT. Subsequently,

(5) the Arbitral Tribunal will consider the Parties’ arbitration costs.
1. Regarding inadmissibility for lack of subject matter

452. It is appropriate to recall that the Claimants have decided to limit the scope of the
present dispute to the alleged illegal nature of RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010
and decided to exclude from their claims RD 9/2013 and subsequent legislation.*”*
The claims presented in this arbitration are therefore based exclusively on these
2010 legislations. The sole repealing provision of RD 9/2013 provides in
paragraphs 2 (a) and (b) that RD 661/2007, regulating the activity of electricity
production under the special regime and RD 1578/2008, regulating the

Translation by Mena Chambers

compensation for electricity production using solar photovoltaic technology for
facilities subsequent to the deadline regarding the maintenance of the
compensation scheme under RD 661/2007 for this technology, are repealed.
Moreover, the repealing provision provides in its paragraph | that “all provisions
of equal or lower rank that contradict or oppose the provisions of this Royal
Decree-Law are repealed”. It is not disputed that such repealing measures entail
the repeal of the 2010 norms object of the present arbitration.*”

453. According to the Respondent “we are therefore faced with a clear case of
supervening disappearance of the object of this arbitration”*°

454. The Arbitral Tribunal notes, however, that although those provisions have been
repealed on the date of entry into force of RDL 9/2013, i.e. 14 July 2013, the 2010
laws were applied until that date and thereafter on a transitional basis, until the
approval of the development regulation of RDL 9/2013. Accordingly, operators
duly registered under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 continued receiving the
corresponding compensation provided by these laws, as modified by the 2010
norms, albeit as payment on account of the liquidation resulting from the
application of the new methodology adopted on the basis of RDL 9/2013.
Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the 2010 laws could have affected,
although in a transitory manner, the rights of the investors. Thus, it cannot be
considered that the present dispute is devoid of subject matter. The Tribunal will

now examine whether the 2010 norms are in violation of the ECT.
2. Article 13 of the ECT (Expropriation)

455. Article 13(1) of the ECT prohibits nationalization, expropriation or measures
having equivalent effect, except where such measures are for reasons of public
interest, non-discriminatory, carried out under a due process of law and
accompanied by payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.

456. The Claimants contend that RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 by “the brutal
economic impact on the profitability of the activity developed by T-Solar”
constitute “an expropriation of a substantial part of the value and of the returns on

the investment.”*°' According to the Claimants, the impact on the economic value

of the investment, although not affecting the ownership, is sufficient to constitute

sas sae 2
an indirect expropriation.”

More precisely, the Claimants submit that, in order to
constitute an indirect expropriation, “total destruction of the investment or loss of
control is not required since a significant interference with the enjoyment of the
investment or its profits can be enough.”*
457. — According to Article 1(6) of the ECT, protected investment means:

“every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor

and includes:

 

(a) ible and ii ible, and ble and ii ble, property, and any
property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity
participation in a company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt
of a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an
economic value and associated with an Investment;

(d) Intellectual Property;

(e) Returns;

() any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licenses and
permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic Activity in the
Energy Sector.”

458. In the present case, the investments made by the Claimants are indirect stakes in
the company T-Solar Group S.A. Thus, the Claimants invested in shares (Article
1(6)(b) of the ECT).

459. However, the Claimants claim to have invested in returns (Article 1(6)(e) of the
ECT) to support its argument that, by affecting future cash flow of T-Solar, the
measures in dispute constitute indirect expropriation.*** According to the
Claimants, by reducing the returns of the plants, the 2010 norms would have

expropriated such returns.*°*

The Arbitral Tribunal is not convinced by this
argument. The object of the investment was not the returns, but the company T-

Solar. The Kingdom of Spain also correctly raised the argument that an investment

protected under Article 1(6) must be owned or controlled by the investor, and that
the Claimants neither own nor control the future returns of the plants, which are

Claimants invested in shares (Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT) and not in returns.

460. — Article 13(1) of the ECT prohibits both expropriatory measures as well as measures
having an effect equivalent to expropriation. To be characterised as an indirect
expropriation under the ECT, a measure must have an effect equivalent to
expropriation. The concept of expropriation is generally accepted as a taking
involving a deprivation of property.*°"’ Consequently, to determine whether there
was an indirect expropriation, the Tribunal must consider whether the disputed
measures had the effect of depriving the investor of all or part of its rights as
shareholders of T-Solar.

461. The Arbitral Tribunal shares the position adopted by several arbitral tribunals that
standard of indirect expropriation under international law implies a substantial
effect on the property rights of the investor.*°* Such an effect can materialise in
the case of an effective deprivation of all or part of the assets constituting the
investment, or a loss of value that could be equal by its magnitude to a deprivation
of the investment.”

462. However, it is not disputed that the Claimants still remain holders of their shares
in T-Solar. Nor has there been allegations that their rights as shareholders of T-
Solar have been limited or affected in some way by the measures discussed in these
proceedings. Finally, it is not disputed that the company T-Solar Group continues

operating and making profits, and it has not been alleged that, although the

measures in dispute may have affected their profitability, the company has been
deprived of all or part of its property or assets.

In fact, the Claimants complain of a decrease in profitability of T-Solar, and
consequently of value of their shares. According to the Claimants, the alleged laws
adopted by the Kingdom of Spain “have reduced the profitability of plants
subjected to RD 1578/2008 of a [...] plant and subject to RD 661/2007 of a [...].”*"°
The Claimants consider that “a loss of profitability of this magnitude is generally
considered serious in the business environment.”""!

The Claimants maintain, with reason, that an indirect expropriation can arise both

. - + 412
from loss of value of an investment and loss of control over it.“!?

However, in
order for a loss of value to be tantamount to expropriation, it has to be of such a
magnitude as to amount to a deprivation of property. In this regard, the 2012
UNCTAD report on expropriation precisely refers to the hypothesis of a
“destruction of value” of the investment.*"?

The Arbitral Tribunal is of the opinion that, although the profitability of T-Solar
could have been seriously affected, such impact is not in itself sufficient to amount
to an expropriation. The Claimants’ reasoning would lead to the conclusion that
any measure affecting profitability of a company could be considered an
expropriation by the mere fact that it entails a decrease in profits and, therefore, in
value. This, of course, cannot be the case. For a measure to be considered as
equivalent to an expropriation, its effects must be of such a significance that it
could be considered that the investor has been deprived, in whole or in part, of its
investment. A simple decrease in the value of the shares constituting the
investment cannot constitute an indirect expropriation, unless the loss of value is
such that it can be considered equivalent to a deprivation of property.

In the present case, if the calculation proposed by the Claimants is accepted, the
profitability of the plants would have decreased to [...] for plants subject to a RD
1578/2008 and to [...] for plants subject to RD 661/2007. While such a reduction
in profitability have had serious economic and financial consequences, the Arbitral

Tribunal considers that it is not of such significance as to destroy the value of the

investment. The Claimants concede that, although the value has been reduced,
profitability of the plants remains positive (of [...] for a plant subject to RD
1578/2008 and [...] for those subject to RD 661/2007).*"4

467. Therefore, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Claimants failed to prove that

the disputed measures had an effect tantamount to an expropriation.

3. Article 10(12) of the ECT (effective means for the assertion of claims)

 

468. Article 10(12) of the ECT provides that “/eJach Contracting Party shall ensure
that its domestic law provides effective means for the assertion of claims and the
enforcement of rights with respect to Investments, investment agreements, and
investment authorizations.”

469. The Claimants submit that the Kingdom of Spain has violated that rule by adopting
RDL 14/2010 since the use of a Royal Decree-Law has been motivated by “the sole
purpose of avoiding the political and social debate that may generate controversial
legislative modifications as in the case of economic restrictions adopted by RDL
14/2010." According to the Claimants, Spanish law does not allow the filing of
a contentious-administrative claim against a RDL and the use of this measure with
the aim of “avoiding the myriad of contentious-administrative claims that the
members of the photovoltaic industry would have presented to challenge the
measures”™'° constitutes a violation of the obligation under Article 10(12) of the
ECT to provide effective means for the assertion of claims.

470. The standard of effective mechanisms as foreseen in Article 10(12) of the ECT
requires States to provide a legal framework that guarantees effective remedies to
investors for realization and protection of their investments.‘'” To verify whether
such requirements are met, tribunals must examine the legal system in question as
a whole. The standard, however, does not impose any obligation on States
regarding the way in which it organizes its judicial system. It is sufficient that an
adequate system of laws and institutions is established and that it functions

effectively.*'*

471. In the present case, the Kingdom of Spain argues that Royal Decree-Law may be
challenged by any citizen through seizure of ordinary court who may submit a
question of unconstitutionality to the Constitutional Court. Moreover, an investor
has an access to the Spanish courts by way of an action for damages on prior
administrative complaint before the organ that carried out the action causing
damage and losses.*"”

472. According to the Arbitral Tribunal, these means are sufficient to meet the
obligation to provide effective mechanism. The Claimants complain that the
question of unconstitutionality may only be submitted incidentally in the ordinary
framework, which compels the investor to wait for the administration to issue a
development or application norm related to the RDL.*° However, the standard of
effective means in international law cannot result in imposing on the State specific
requirements for organizing its review system, such as forcing the State to provide
asystem of direct control of the constitutionality of acts with a legislative character.
The Claimants also complain that the claim for damages does not allow the
constitutional control of the RDL. The latter complaint, however, does not
constitute a violation of the standard to provide effective means in international
law from the moment the Respondent proves the existence of means allowing both
constitutional control (albeit incidentally) and compensation for damage and

clearly shown that the Board of Contentious-Administrative Litigation of the
Supreme Court was aware of, and indeed it decided, questions concerning the
constitutionality of RDL 14/2010.*7!

violation of the standard of effective means.

regime and by undermining their legitimate expectations. The Claimants also
argue that (b) the measures violate their rights as they are retroactive.

a) Alteration of the regulatory framework and infringement of the

legitimate expectations of the investor

Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that “/feJach Contracting Party shall, in
accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable,
equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other
Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area.” Moreover, Article 10(1)
provides that the obligation to grant investments fair and equitable treatment forms
part of these conditions.
It follows from Article 10(1) that the obligation to provide fair and equitable
treatment is included in the more general obligation to create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions.
Firstly, in their Claim, the Claimants submit that Spain violated Article 10(1) of

the ECT by “modifving in an unexpected fashion of its regulatory and economic

9/2013 and Law 24/2013 to confirm that [...] today, the compensation regime for
Photovoltaic plants, objective of Charanne’s and Construction’s investments,
remains unknown."

The Claimants then describe the evolution of the regulatory framework from 2010
until today to argue that, as a whole, the 2010 and 2013 reforms created a situation
of instability contrary to Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Claimants also appear to
argue a lack of clarity of the regulatory framework.

The Arbitral Tribunal cannot, however, determine whether the 2013 regulations
contributed to the lack of stability or clarity of the regulatory framework contrary

to the ECT without exceeding its powers. Indeed, the Claimants themselves have

excluded from the framework of this arbitration the 2013 norms. In that regard,
the Claimants very precisely allege that “they do not ask for any declaration of the
Tribunal on RDL 9/2013 and its implementing measures.”*?

Accordingly, the 2013 norms cannot be analysed as a fact generating responsibility
neither can they, as being posterior to the 2010 norms (sole object of this
arbitration), have any relevance in assessing whether these regulations are in
violation of Spain’s international obligations.

The analysis of the existence of the alleged lack of stability and clarity of the
regulatory framework should therefore be limited to the subject of this dispute, as
has been defined by the Claimants, i.e. solely the 2010 norms.

In this limited context of the 2010 norms, the Arbitral Tribunal cannot reach the
conclusion that Spain violated its obligation of regulatory stability. Assessing
whether the evolution of the regulatory framework constitutes an instability
contrary to Article 10(1) of the ECT would, in fact, suppose the examination as a
whole of all the regulatory changes introduced to date.

Regarding the clarity of the regulatory framework, it has not been alleged that the
2010 norms were ambiguous or difficult to understand as such. The claim that “the
compensation regime for photovoltaic plants, object of Charanne’s and
Construction’s investment remains unknown” refers to the combination of the
evolutions of the regulatory framework until 2013 and, thus, cannot be evaluated
in this arbitration.“”°

To analyse whether the 2010 norms violate other obligations provided in Article
10(1) of the ECT, the existence of legitimate expectations of the investor is a
relevant factor. The Tribunal shares the position of tribunals that have estimated,
based on good faith principle of customary international law, that a State cannot
induce an investor to make an investment, hereby generating legitimate
expectations, to later ignore the commitments that had generated such

expectations.*?”

The Claimants argue that, by adopting RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010, Spain has
infringed the legitimate expectations generated for investors with the prior rule, in
particular RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.*?*

To demonstrate that these latest rules generated legitimate expectations, the

2
42° as well as on the

Claimants rely on several decisions of investment tribunals,
2012 study by the UNCTAD on Fair and Equitable Treatment.**””
The UNCTAD study on which the Claimants base their claim“*! notes that “arbitral

decisions suggest [...] that an investor may derive legitimate expectations either

from (a) specific commitments personally, for example in the form of stabilization

clause, or (b) rules that are not specifically addressed to a particular investor but
which are put in place with a specific aim to induce foreign investment and on
which the foreign investor relied in making his investment.”

In the present case, there are no specific commitments adopted by Spain directed
at the Claimants. Such commitments could have been made on the basis of a
stabilization clause, or with any kind of statement that the State had directed to the
investors, according to which the existing regulatory framework will not change.
Such declarations have not been addressed to the Claimants.

The Claimants consider however that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were
specific commitments by Spain as they are directed at a specific limited group of
investors who meet the requirements within the established time periods.**

The Tribunal will further consider whether such regulatory framework was such as
to generate legitimate expectations that it would not be modified as it was in 2010.
The Tribunal, however, does not accept the argument that such rules may constitute
or be equivalent to a specific commitment.

Although RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were directed to a limited group of
investors, it does not make them to be commitments specifically directed at each
investor. The rules at issue do not lose the general nature that characterizes any

law or regulation by their specific scope. To convert a regulatory standard into a

specific commitment of the state, by the limited character of the persons who may
be affected, would constitute an excessive limitation on power of states to regulate
the economy in accordance with the public interest.

494. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that there was no specific
commitment by Spain vis-a-vis the Claimants. Thus, the question is whether the
legal order in force at the time of the investment could in itself generate legitimate
expectations, and if so, which ones.

495. A finding that there has been a violation of investor’s expectations must be based
on an objective standard or analysis, as the mere subjective belief that could have
had the investor at the moment of making of the investment is not sufficient.
Moreover, the application of the principle accordingly depends on whether the
expectation has been reasonable in the particular case with relevance to
representations possibly made by the host State to induce the investment.

496. _ Firstly, the analysis of the arguments presented by the Claimants to argue that Spain

waged a “campaign to attract investment™™*

must be performed. According to the
the Claimants, such campaign materialized in the distribution of documents such
as “The Sun Can be Yours” in which high returns were announced.**> The Tribunal
does not believe that, by themselves, these documents could have generated a
legitimate expectation as to the fact that the tariff anticipated at the time of the
investment would not be modified.

497.  Itis true that these documents and their presentations that were conducted in Spain
indicate the will of the Respondent to promote and attract investment in the sector
of renewable energy generation. However, these documents are not specific
enough to have generated an expectation as to the fact that RD 661/2007 and
1578/2008 would not be modified. Although the 2007 presentation does contain a
reference to RD 661/2007, it does not include any language from which it can
reasonably be inferred that the regulated tariff would remain untouched for the rest
of the regulatory lives of the plants.

498. Thus, the relevant question is whether the existing regulatory framework at the time

of investment could give rise to a legitimate expectation protected by international

434 DHBI Claimants, paras. 143 et seq.

law that it would not be modified or altered by norms such as those adopted in
2010.

499. According to the Arbitral Tribunal and in the absence of a specific commitment,
an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that existing rules will not be
modified.

500. The Tribunal agrees in this respect with the position adopted by the tribunal in

Electrabel v. Hungary under the ECT, according to which “/w/hile the investor is

 

promised pi ion against unfair ch itis well blished that the host State
is entitled to maintain a reasonable degree of regulatory flexibility to respond to
changing circumstances in the public interest. Consequently, the requirement of
fairness must not be understood as the immutability of the legal framework, but as
implying that subsequent changes should be made fairly, consistently and
predictably, taking into account the circumstances of the investment.”**°

501. | The Tribunal also deems relevant the considerations delivered by other tribunals
although taken under other treaties. The Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the tribunal
in CMS v. Argentina, in that “it is not a question of whether the legal framework
may need to be frozen as it can always evolve and be adapted to changing
circumstances, but neither is it a question of whether the framework can be
dispensed with all together when specific commitments to the contrary have been
made. The law of foreign investment and its protection has been developed with
the specific objection of avoiding such adverse legal effects."

502. Moreover, the tribunal in E/ Paso v. Argentina considered that “if the often
repeated formula to the effect that “the stability of the legal and business
framework is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment” were true,
legislation could never be changed: the mere enunciation of that proposition shows

its irrelevance. Such a standard of behaviour, if strictly applied, is not realistic,

436 Electrabel v. Hungary, part VII, p. 21, para 7.77. Unofficial translation: “While the investor is promised
protection against unfair changes, it is well-established that the host State is entitled to maintain a reasonable

subsequent changes should be made fairly, consistently and predictably, taking into account the circumstances of

nor is it the BITs’ purpose that States guarantee that the economic and legal

conditions in which investments take place will remain unaltered ad infinitum.”

[...] “Jn other words, the Tribunal cannot follow the line of cases in which fair and

equitable treatment was viewed as implying the stability of the legal and business

framework. Economic and legal life is by nature evolutionary.”**

503. In this case, the Claimants could not have the legitimate expectation that the
regulatory framework established by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 would
remain unchanged for the lifetime of their plants. Admitting the existence of such
an expectation would, in effect, be equivalent to freeze the regulatory framework
applicable to eligible plants, although circumstances may change. Any
modification in the amount of the tariff or any limitation of the number of eligible
hours would then constitute a violation of international law. In practice, the
situation would be the same that if the State had signed a stabilisation clause or
adopted a commitment to not modify the regulatory framework. The Arbitral
Tribunal cannot support such a conclusion. The Claimants have made very clear
that they do not claim to have had the legitimate expectation that the regulatory
framework would remain unchanged.*”

504. The Tribunal’s conclusion according to which, in the absence of a specific
commitment, the Claimants could not have a reasonable expectation that the
regulatory framework established by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 remain
frozen is reinforced by the fact that the jurisprudence of the highest Spanish judicial
authorities had clearly established, prior to the investment, the principle that
national law allowed to make changes to the regulation.

505. In this regard, the Arbitral Tribunal shares the Respondent’s position according to
which, “in order to exercise the right of legitimate expectations, the Claimants
should have made a diligent analysis of the legal framework for the investment.”*°

This position is consistent with the position adopted by other tribunals. The

tribunal in Frontier, for example, considered that “a foreign investor has to make

its business decisions and shape its expectations on the basis of the law and the

factual situation prevailing in the country as it stands at the moment of the

438 E/ Paso v. Argentina, paras. 350, 352.

investment.”*"' Indeed, in order to be in violation of the legitimate expectations of
the investor, regulatory measures must not have been reasonably foreseeable at the
time of the investment. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that in the present case,
the Claimants could have easily foreseen possible adjustments to the regulatory
framework as those introduced by the rules of 2010. In fact, the Spanish law clearly
left open the possibility that the system of compensation applicable to
photovoltaics could be modified.

506. For example, the Spanish Supreme Court had estimated in December 2005 that “no
legal hurdle exists for the Government, in the exercise of its regulatory power and
in light of the broad competences on which relies a strict regulated subject such as
electricity, to modify the compensation system provided that it acts under the
framework established by the LSE” In October 2006, the Supreme Court
similarly decided that “the owner of the facilities of electricity production in the
special regime do not have a ‘frozen right’ that the economic regime that regulates
the reception of bonus remain unaltered. Such a regime actually tries to encourage
the use of renewable energy through an incentive mechanism that, as any other,
has no guarantee to remain unchanged for the future.”**

507. The Tribunal does not share the position of the Claimants that those decisions
would be irrelevant or taken out of context. Although they relate to different rules,
these failures clearly establish the principle that national law allowed to provide,
within the framework of the LSE, changes to an economic system to encourage the
generation of renewable energy as it was established with RD 661/2007 and RD
1578/2008. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants could have, at the time they
made their investment in 2009, an analysis of the legal framework of its investment
in Spanish law and understand that there was a possibility that the regulations
adopted in 2007 and 2008 could be modifications. At least that is the level of care
that would be expected of a foreign investor in a highly regulated as the energy
sector, where a preliminary and comprehensive legal framework applicable to the

sector analysis is essential to proceed with the investment.

Although decisions of the Spanish courts are not binding on the Arbitral Tribunal,
they remain relevant as factual elements to verify that an investor could not, at the
time of the disputed investment, have the reasonable expectation that in the absence
of a specific commitment the regulation would not be modified throughout the life
of the plants.

The Claimants have alleged in this regard that under the existing regulatory
framework, the registration to the RAIPRE gave generators an acquired right to the
perception of the tariff,““* which would establish a legitimate expectation that it
would not be subsequently modified. The Tribunal does not accept this argument.
Firstly, the Respondent has convincingly demonstrated that, in Spanish law, the
registration to the RAIPRE was simply an administrative requirement to be able to
sell energy and did not imply that the registered facilities had an acquired right to
a determined compensation.> Secondly, the existence of legitimate expectations
must be analysed under international law and not under national law. However, as
stated in previous sections of this award, in the absence of a specific commitment
toward stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory
framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at any time
to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Claimants could not have the legitimate
expectation that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 would not be changed during the
lifespan of its facilities.

That does not mean, however, that the rules of 2010 cannot by themselves violate
the standard of fair and equitable treatment.

In the Statement of Claim, the Claimants submit in this regard that “the legitimate
expectations of the investor [...] are frustrated, even in the absence of specific
commitments, when the receiving State performs acts incompatible with a criterion
of economic reasonableness, with public interest or with the principle of
proportionality."

The Arbitral Tribunal accepts the principle behind this approach. In fact, an

investor has a legitimate expectation that, when modifying the existing regulation

based on which the investment was made, the State will not act unreasonably,
disproportionately or contrary to the public interest.

The legitimate expectations on which the Claimants rely are based on the contents
of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. The Tribunal will therefore analyse whether,
by amending these regulations through the 2010 norms, the Respondent acted
unreasonably, against the public interest, or in a disproportionate fashion.

The existing regulatory framework at the time of the regulation was essentially
constituted by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. Such norms can be summarized
as follows:

° firstly, an investor could have recourse to the regime only upon
meeting certain requirements, among others, the realization of the
investment in facilities and their registration to the RAIPRE within the
statutory deadlines;

° secondly, the generators that managed to launch their facilities within
the deadlines set by the Government would benefit from the
implementation of a particular tariff (“Feed in Tariff” or “FIT”)
attached to the regime. For facilities under RD 661/2007 - registered
prior to 30 September 2008, the FIT would apply for the first 25 years
and may be reduced to 80% of its value from year 26. For facilities
regulated under RD 1578/2008, the tariff was determined for the first
25 years of operation; and

° thirdly, both RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 authorized to place all
of the net production of energy in the system and no hourly limit was
established for the implementation of FIT.

As for proportionality, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that this criterion is satisfied
as long as the changes are not capricious or unnecessary and do not amount to
suddenly and unpredictably eliminate the essential characteristics of the existing
regulatory framework.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 established
specific rules whose essential characteristics are to ensure each operator who meets
the requirements a guaranteed tariff (or where applicable a premium) and

privileged access to the electricity distribution grid. These principles allow, within

the framework of the LSE, to ensure renewable energy generators reasonable
profitability referred by Article 30.4 of the LSE.

However, the 2010 norms have not eliminated these features from the existing
regulation.

Indeed, RD 1565/2010 maintained the tariff until year 26, constraint that was
subsequently extended by Law 2/2011 until year 30 for eligible plants. The
difference between the situation resulting from the Law 2/2011 and the previous
situation is that under RD 661/2007 the tariff remained in effect, albeit reduced to
80% of its previous value, from the year 26 and for the lifetime of the facility.
There is a debate between the Parties as to whether the life of a photovoltaic plant
could exceed thirty years. If it could not, it is obvious that the modification
introduced in 2010 could not in any way affect the investors.

The Tribunal does not find convincing the Claimants’ evidence that the life of a
plant can actually exceed 30 years.

The Claimants submit that the useful life of the facilities lies between 35 and 50
years” and also argue that the fact that the plants could forever obtain the FTI was
a fundamental aspect of the regulatory regime under RD 661/2007.*

The Respondent asserts that the life of a plant is between 25 and 30 years, and that
in the event of the life extension of the plant, it would be necessary to almost
replace all the equipment which would imply a “substantial modification”
according to Article 4 RD 661/2007 and would preclude rights to the tariff.”
Although the Claimants agree with the Respondent that the substantial

45° the Claimants

modifications would imply the preclusion of the regulated tariff,
argue that it was not necessary to make substantial modifications since making
minor maintenance changes could extend the useful life of the facilities beyond 30
years.*!

According to the Respondent, the fact that the expectation of the Claimants did not
exceed 30 years confirms the fact that this limit coincides with the maximum

duration of leases for use of the land on which plants are located." In this regard,

the Claimants contend that this is not essential because the contracts had clauses
that allowed extensions.**

527. | The Tribunal is convinced by the arguments and explanations advanced by the
Respondent and its expert from Altran Mac-Group*™ in the sense that, taking into
account the available technology at the time of the facilities’ constructions, the
maximum lifespan would not exceed 30 years without making essential
modifications. Either way, regardless of the objective analysis on the lifespan of
each plant, it appears to the Tribunal that in the majority of cases the Claimants
foresaw a duration of 25 years for the land leases contracts (24 our of 34); with
some contracts reaching 30 years (6 out of 34), and only 2 contracts with a duration
over 30 years. In fact, and as described by the Claimant’s expert’s report on
calculation of future cash flows, the average “time limit for facilities’ operation”
is 27,5 years.*°°

528. On the other hand, other documents prior to investment that have been raised by

0*¢ and the

the Claimants as generators of expectations such as the PER 2005-201
2005 and 2007 The Sun Can Be Yours presentations**” also refer in their templates
of plants whose lifespan was 25 years.

529. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal does not find convincing the Claimants’
assertion that an essential element of their expectations as investors was to be able
to exploit the plant for a period of between 35 and 50 years without making any
essential changes and thus enjoying the tariffs. The modification made by RD
1565/2010 and by implementation of Law 2/2011 extended the application of
tariffs to the first 30 years of the plant’s operation and could not violate the
legitimate expectations of the Claimants.

530. The other element of change introduced by the 2010 norms was the limitation of
the yearly eligible hours to the tariff based on two elements (i) the climatic zone
according to the average solar radiation in Spain according to RD 314/O6and (ii)
the type of technology used (fixed or on one or two axes). The Arbitral Tribunal
considers that the number of hours eligible for the tariff is not likely to create

legitimate expectations under international law. The opposite position would be

tantamount to freeze the existing regulatory framework in 2008 in terms of
duration, amount and number of eligible hours. Spain argues that the limitation of
eligible hours according to climate zones and type of technology used is simply the
result of PER 2005- 2010, which links electricity generation from photovoltaic
technology to the solar resource, establishing a plan of the average daily quantity
of energy per unit area in five climatic zones defined in the Technical Construction
Code.*°8

531. | The Tribunal remains convinced by the arguments put forward by the Respondent
according to which the limits of RDL 14/2010 were limits of eligible production
hours taken into account by the legislator in RD 661/2007 and 1578/2008 to
calculate the compensation for the plants (to calculate the tariff). Regarding the
zones, Spain demonstrated that Annex XII of RD 661/2007 already contained a
table showing that time zones were anticipated.*”

532. These circumstances reinforce the Arbitral Tribunal in the conclusion that the
introduction of an hourly limitation based on the principle of adjustment with
climatic zones established in PER 2005-2010 was not disproportionate and cannot
have violated any legitimate expectation under international law.

533. Tobe sure, the 2010 norms have implemented adjustments and adaptations that did
not eliminate the fundamental characteristics of the existing regulatory framework,
considering that the photovoltaic operators remained entitled to a tariff (FIT) as
well as the possibility to sell their electricity production to the system in priority,
which in the opinion of this Arbitral Tribunal cannot have violated any legitimate
expectation under international law.

534. In terms of economic rationality, the Tribunal finds that both the temporal
limitation as the limitation of eligible hours cannot be branded as irrational. As
mentioned above, the limitation of the tariff to thirty years reflects an objective
criterion that is the expected lifetime of a photovoltaic power plant, while limiting
eligible hours reflects an objective criterion based on the climate zone in which the
plant is located and the technology used. In the opinion of the Arbitral Tribunal,

been adopted on the basis of objective criteria and cannot be considered irrational
or arbitrary.

Nor has it been proven that the 2010 norms would be against the public interest.
Although there is a debate between the Parties on the evolution of the tariff deficit,
it is true that premiums paid to the photovoltaic sector accounted for more than
what is paid to all other technologies in absolute terms,*® and were increasing
every year in important proportions.*"' The Arbitral Tribunal also believes that the
price paid by domestic consumers per KW/hour was increasing in Spain above the
average proportion of the European Union.‘

In view of all these circumstances, it is not arbitrary, irrational or contrary to public
interest for the Respondent to have implemented measures to try to limit the deficit
and price increases. Furthermore, the Claimants have the burden of proving the
arbitrary or irrational nature of the measures under discussion and have not
provided such evidence.

Nor the Claimants have provided any proof that the other disputed measures, i.e.
the requirement to pay a toll of 0.5 Euros/MWh for access to the transportation and
distribution network as set by the first transitional provision of RDL 14/2010 and
according to European standards, as well as the implementation of security
measures against voltage sags of the facilities according to Article 1.5 of RD
1565/2010, were irrational, arbitrary, disproportionate or contrary to public interest
and, therefore, contrary to international law.

The Kingdom of Spain rightfully argues that the requirement to cover voltage sags
is reasonable because it aims at preventing the technical collapse of the system and
contributes to ensure better security and better management. The Claimants have
alleged that the rules relating to voltage sags would be discriminatory as they would
not apply the same compensation provided for wind generation.“ The Tribunal
does not find this argument convincing, as the State may well apply different rules
to different industrial sectors without violating the obligation not to discriminate in

international law.

539. | Insummary, the Tribunal finds that the 2010 norms cannot be considered to violate
the ECT. These rules, in fact, introduce limited amendments to the regulatory
framework existing at the time of the investment without eliminating its essential
characteristics, in particular the existence of a guaranteed tariff throughout the life
of the facility. The Claimants have not demonstrated that the 2010 norms would
violate the legitimate expectations under the ECT by being unreasonable, arbitrary,
contrary to public interest, or disproportionate. Nor is there any proof that these
norms were unfair or inconsistent. Finally, the Claimants have not shown that the
2010 norms had been adopted in violation of Spanish legislative and regulatory due
process.“

540. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that on the limited basis of the 2010 norms
referred to it by the Claimants, no violation of the obligation of Spain to grant fair
and equitable treatment can be proven.

541. Finally, the Claimants have neither claimed nor shown any violation of Spain’s
obligation to ensure full protection and security, or the obligation not to take
unreasonable or discriminatory measures that could prejudice the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation of the investment.

542. In reaching this conclusion, the Arbitral Tribunal obviously does not in any way
prejudge the conclusions that could reach another arbitral tribunal based on the
analysis of all the norms adopted to date, including the 2013 norms that have not

been examined by the Tribunal by choice of the Parties.
b) Retroactivity

543. The Claimants submit that, in applying immediately to the plants registered in the
RAIPRE, the 2010 measures undermined “acquired rights of T-Solar’*° The
Claimants further argue that “7-Solar was entitled to a fixed tariff, without hourly
restrictions, during the time period established in RD 661/2007. The substitution
of this right by a scattered version that alters the economic balance under which
Claimants decided to invest is an act of retroactive regulation incompatible with
art. 10(1) of the ECT?" In its Reply, the Claimants reiterated this argument,

adding that their “acquired right” constituted “a real asset incorporated to the

in CMS vy. Argentina as well as other awards where Argentina was condemned for
the effects of the conversion of dollars into pesos.

544. The Arbitral Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants’ argument regarding the
alleged retroactivity of the 2010 measures.

545. Firstly, the present situation is very different from the situation addressed in the
CMS vy. Argentina award, in which there was a violation of contractual
commitments. In this case, there is no similar commitment. Here the issue is to
determine to what extent the State can modify and immediately apply regulatory
measures of general application.

546. In fact, the Claimants’ argument on retroactivity is simply a different formulation
of the argument that the State did not have any possibility to alter the legal
framework benefiting the Claimant’s plants. However, this Tribunal has already
explained that the obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment does not mean
that the regulatory framework should remain the same for all eligible plants
throughout their lifespans. In fact, such an approach would amount to freeze the
regulatory framework, limiting any change of the regulation to new generation
plants that would settle after such changes.

547. The Tribunal has already determined in previous sections of this award that, in
Spanish law, the registration with the RAIPRE was simply an administrative
requirement to sell energy and that it did not imply that the registered facilities had
a acquired right to a certain remuneration.*

548. The Claimants do not explain in their submissions in what extent should
international law lead to the conclusion that there is an acquired right to the
maintenance of the tariff, nor the reason why the application of the 2010 norms to
plants that were registered with the RAIPRE would violate the ECT. In this regard,
it is not disputed that the 2010 norms applied immediately from their entry into
force when the plants were already in operation, but did not apply retroactively to
prior periods. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that there is no principle of

international law prohibiting a State to take regulatory measures with immediate

effect in situations in progress except when there are specific commitments as those
resulting from a contract. At the very least, the existence of such a principle has
not been demonstrated by the Claimants.

549. Based on the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ argument according to
which the immediate implementation of the 2010 norms would violate Article

10(1) of the ECT.

5. Arbitration costs

a) Costs of arbitration (Article 43 of the Rules)

550. In accordance with Article 43 of the Rules, the arbitration costs include the fees
and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal, the administrative fee and expenses of the
Institute, as well as the reasonable costs incurred by the Parties under Article 44 of
the Rules.

551. On 19 January 2016, the Board of the Institute set the arbitration costs as follows:

The fees for the President of the Arbitral Tribunal, Alexis Mourre, amount to
[...] and compensation for expenses to [...];

The fees for the arbitrator Guido Santiago Tawil amount to [...] and
compensation for expenses [...];

The fees for arbitrator Claus Von Wobeser amount to [...] and compensation
for expenses amount to L. Ae
The administrative fee of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce amount to [...]
and the expenses incurred amount to [...].‘”°

552. According to the above, although the parties had made anticipated deposits of [...],
the Council of the Institute fixed the total costs in accordance with article 43 of the
Rules to [...] and [...].. The value added tax (V.A.T) must be added to these

amounts where applicable.
b) Reasonable Costs of the Parties (Article 44 of the Rules)

553. On 15 September 2015, each Party submitted its submissions on costs.*”!

409

47 These expenses are incurred by the SCC to anticipate the expenses of arbitrator Tawil. This sum will thus be
only counted once to determine the fixed total cost of the Institute.

47 On 16 September 2015, the Claimants submitted a supplementary brief completing the expenses incurred for
professional services of the Deloitte experts on damages and the amounts paid in respect of arbitration costs.

©) Decision of the Arbitral Tribunal on Costs

Article 43(5) of the Rules provides that, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, at
the request of a party the Arbitral Tribunal shall allocate the costs of arbitration
between them, taking into consideration the outcome of the case and other relevant
circumstances.

Article 44 of the Rules in turn provides that unless otherwise agreed by the parties,
the Arbitral Tribunal may, in the final award and at the request of a party, order a
party to pay any reasonable costs incurred by the other party, including costs of
legal representation, taking into consideration the outcome of the case and other
relevant circumstances.

In this case, there is no agreement of the Parties in regards the costs allocation and
consequently each Party has asked the Tribunal to order the other Party to pay the
incurred costs.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Claimants were not successful in their
demands and therefore must bear all expenses and the share of the costs of
arbitration paid in advance. The Claimants are therefore not entitled to any refund

by the Respondent.

Translation by Mena Chambers

The Tribunal considers that since the Respondent was successful on the Merits but
not regarding the jurisdictional issues raised before this Tribunal, the Respondent
is only refunded of a part of its own reasonable costs.

Regarding lawyers’ fees, the Arbitral Tribunal notes the disproportion between the
amount of [...] claimed by the Respondent in fees and expenses of its lawyers and
the claim made by the Claimants of [...]. The Tribunal considers that Respondent’s
claims regarding fees is disproportionate in comparison with the value of the
claims, which is less than ten million euros. Although the matters under discussion
can be complex, the Tribunal considers that the parties could have limited their
spending considering the limited value of the dispute.

Thus, the Arbitral Tribunal considers, in light of all relevant circumstances, that
the reasonable amount regarding expenses of legal representation is one million
Euro.

However, the Tribunal also takes into account that the Respondent has not been
successful in its jurisdictional arguments, which, because of their complexity, have
occupied a substantial part of the time of the parties and of the Tribunal in this
arbitration. The Tribunal therefore considers it appropriate to limit the
reimbursement to which the Respondent is entitled to 50% of the costs of
reasonable legal representation.

Based on the above, the Arbitral Tribunal decides that the Claimants shall pay the
Respondent the sum of 500,000 EUR for costs of legal representation.

As for the costs of the experts, the Respondent contends a sum of [...] for fees of
the experts. The Arbitral Tribunal considers that, as such expenses were based on
the merits part of this arbitration, the Respondent is entitled to full payment of this
sum.

As for the share of the arbitration costs fixed by the Council of the Institute were
paid in advance by the Respondent, i.e. the sum of 269,208.29 EUR and 10,310
USD the Arbitral Tribunal finds that, for the same reasons given regarding costs of
legal representation, Claimants shall pay Respondent half of this amount, i.e.
134,604.14 EUR and 5,155 USD. Value added tax (V.A.T) may be added to this
amount if applicable.

Finally, the Respondent is entitled to be paid for their entire share of the costs of

organisation of hearings and transcripts, i.e. 16,610.31 EUR.

Translation by Mena Chambers

In conclusion, the Claimants shall pay Respondent the sum of 1,310,785.45 EUR
and 5,155 USD for costs and reasonable fees.

The Respondent asks for interests at a “a reasonable rate” on such amount from
the date on which such costs occurred until the actual payment date.*”

The Respondent, however, has not demonstrated the date on which it paid the
claimed sums and therefore it is not possible in this award to identify the starting
date for interests. Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal will only order interests
posterior to this award. Regarding the interest rate applicable, and as the sums have

been paid by the Spanish State the Tribunal considers it appropriate to apply the

legal rate applicable in Spain.

X. DECISION

573.

For the reasons stated above, the Arbitral Tribunal:
a) Has jurisdiction to resolve the present dispute;
b) Rejects Claimants’ claims in their entirety;
c) Orders the Claimants, jointly and severally, to pay the Respondent:

- for arbitration costs, as fixed by the Council of the Institute
according to Article 43 of the Rules, the sum of 134,604.14 EUR
and 5,155 USD. The value added tax (V.A.T) must be added if
applicable.

- for reasonable costs, incurred by the Respondent under Article 44 of
the Rules, the sum of 1,176,181.31 EUR.

d) The amounts referred to in paragraph (c) will attract interest in favour of the
Respondent at the legal rate in force in Spain after the date of this award and

until the date of payment.

Translation by Mena Chambers

1. Iconcur with the findings of my distinguished arbitrator colleagues on aspects relating
to the recognition of the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal to resolve this dispute. In
that sense, I agree that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide the dispute between the

Claimants and the Kingdom of Spain under the Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”).

2. Regarding the substance, I agree with the standard of “indirect expropriation” applied
by the majority of the Arbitral Tribunal in paragraph 461 of the Award, to the extent
that it is characterized by the existence of a “substantiate deprivation” of property
rights. As the reasoning and decision of this Tribunal was limited - by decisions of the
parties — to the issuance and entry into force of RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 (the
“2010 norms” according to the definition used in the Award) and excluding from the
analysis norms issued subsequently, I also agree that an indirect expropriation of the

investment by the Kingdom of Spain under Article 13(1) of the ECT is not established.

3. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the rationale and conclusions of the majority on the
approach of “/egitimate expectations” that make up the standard of “fair and equitable

treatment” under Article 10(1) of the ECT.

4. Firstly, I agree that the verification of whether there has been violation of legitimate
expectation must be in accordance with an “objective” standard or analysis - not on the
mere subjective belief that the investor may have had at the date of the investment —
criterion that must to be evaluated case by case. Consequently, I admit that the
application of the principle depends on whether the expectation had been reasonable in
the case at hand,' with particular relevance on the representations made by the host
State to induce the investment and, in that regard, the modification of the legal regime

produced once the investment has been made.

5. My disagreement with the majority is that, in my opinion, the creation of legitimate
expectations for an investor is not solely limited to the existence of a “specific
commitment” — whether of a contractual nature or based on statements or specific terms
granted by the host State — but can also originate or be based on the legal order in force

when the investment is made.”

6. In the case under review, the regulatory scheme of the special regime put in place by
the Kingdom of Spain through RD 661/07 and from 1578/08, setting a fixed “Feed in
Tariff’ (“FIT”) with a temporal validity — of a minimum — of 25 years which was
declared as not impacted by future tariff revisions, together with other documents at
issued at the same time by the Spanish Government’ — which although cannot
potentially generate legitimate expectations by themselves but are used to interpret the
context and the objective of the regulatory measures — appear as decisive, in my
opinion, for the investor to decide to invest in photovoltaic plants. Therefore,
confronted to the enactment of RD 661/07 and RD1578/08, the applicants could have
“objectively” imagined that the tariff regime established in each one of them’ would be

maintained and not altered.

7. Inthis sense, the system established by RD 661/07 and RD1578/08 constituted a regime
of promotion and “encouragement”, a traditional instrument of economic policy aimed
at creating different incentives to direct private capital in a given direction, aim that
would probably not be achieved otherwise. This is a legitimate action of the Spanish
State directed at “protecting and promoting” these economic activities by individuals
that satisfy public needs or general utility, omitting the employment of coercion the

beneficial activity that characterise a public service.

foreign investments and on which the foreign investor relied in making his investment". In Total v. Argentina, the
Tribunal concluded that not only can contracts, concessions and stabilization clauses create legitimate
expectations but any intentional conduct from the host State that give the investor the belief that it has “the intent
to pursue a certain conduct in the future” or that creates “expectations in potential investors with respect to
particular treatment or comportment”. See: Total S.A. v Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB / 04/1),

8. Moreover, I am of the opinion that the regime implemented by RD 661/07 and RD
1578/08 was not directed at a non-determined “generality” or to a vague and
unspecified group, but rather to a small number of potential recipients, who had enough
capital to invest in the analysed industry and that the Kingdom of Spain considered

appropriate to encourage to do so, avoiding in turn to use its own capital.

9. This regime did not have a validity sine die or indefinite, but required the investment
in photovoltaic facilities to be conducted, registered at the registrar’ and being
operational prior to the expiration of a deadline. Failure to comply with this temporal
pattern prevented the access to special benefits established in the regulation. These two
elements, i.e. (i) a provision that created a strong incentive to invest in renewable energy
generation, directed to a determinable number of potential applicants and (ii) a short
period of coverage allowing entitlement to benefits, hereby directing private capital to
the realization of the desired investment, are defining, in my view, to accept the

existence of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

=

. Once the Claimants made their investment, complying with all the requirements
provided by the norm in force regarding the granting of the expected benefit (in this
case the FIT), it does not appear as legally acceptable to recognize a prerogative to the

host State to modify and eliminate this benefit without any judicial consequences.

. There is an argument often used in the Award which considers that admitting legitimate
expectations in this case would amount to admit that the regulatory power of the host
State is “frozen” sine die indefinitely or that the legislation cannot be subsequently
modified in accordance with the public interest. I respectfully disagree with that
assessment. There is no doubt that, as a general rule, there is no acquired right to the
maintenance of a particular general legal regime, nor a legitimate expectation to the
stability of laws and regulations. The host State always retains its regulatory power and
can modify its legislation, even in cases where a stabilisation cause has been granted.
Nevertheless, if in the valid exercise of that regulatory power of the host State affects
acquired rights or legitimate expectations, the State must compensate the damage

caused.

© See: Article 14 of Royal Decree 661/07: "The definitive registration in the Administrative Register for production
facilities under the special regime will be required for this facility to benefit from the regulated economic regime
in this decree, with effects from the first day of the month following the date of the facility's commissioning”.

Translation by Mena Chambers

In short, when an investor complies with all the requirements established by the
legislation in force to be granted a specific and particular benefit, its subsequent
ignorance by the host State of the investment violates a legitimate expectation. The
Kingdom of Spain was empowered to modify or remove the promotional regime, there
was no risk of freezing, petrification or immutability of the regulatory framework.
Nevertheless, if the modification of the benefit granted to those who have invested
according to this special regime — by establishing in this case a limitation on operating
hours and years with a right to a regulated tariff — caused damage without adequate
compensation it would violate the legitimate expectations created and, consequently,

fair and equitable treatment protected in Article 10 of the ECT.

. Given the way in which the majority decided, there is no need to give any declaration

in relation to the existence or non existence of the alleged damage, its magnitude or the

compensation required.
