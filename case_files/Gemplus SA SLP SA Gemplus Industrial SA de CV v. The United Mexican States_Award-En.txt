(02) THE DISPUTE

1-9 The Claimants claim damages against the Respondent for the latter’s several breaches of
two bilateral investment treaties made by the Respondent with France and Argentina

respectively, namely (i) as regards the Gemplus Claimants, the 1998 Agreement

Part 1 — Page 2

1-10

1-11

1-12

1-13

between the Government of the Republic of France and the Government of the United
Mexican States on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (the “France
BIT”) and (ii) as regards Talsud, the 1996 Agreement between the Government of the
Republic of Argentina and the Government of the United States of Mexico for the

Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (the “Argentina BIT”).

The Claimants allege against the Respondent (a) unlawful expropriation, (b) unfair,
inequitable and arbitrary treatment and (c) failure to provide full protection and security
in regard to their investments in the Concessionaire, Renave S.A. de C.V. (part owned
by the Claimants as to 49% of its shareholding), determined either as at 21 August 2000
or alternatively no later than 13 December 2002. (For ease of reference, references in

this Award are made to this Concessionaire as “Renave” or the “Concessionaire”).

The Claimants advance their claims under the two BITs only; neither treaty contains
any form of “umbrella clause”; and the Claimants do not advance any claims in
contract, administrative law or private law against the Respondent, whether under the
Concessionaire’s concession agreement made with the Respondent directly, derivatively

or otherwise.

The Claimants claim damages in the total principal sum of 340 million pesos (equated
to approximately US $37 million) or alternatively 222 million pesos (equated to
approximately US $24 million), 29% of such sum for Talsud and 20% for the Gemplus

Claimants, together with interest and costs.

According to their claim, the Claimants invested a total of 35.8 million pesos in their
Concessionaire: 21.4 million pesos by Talsud and 14.5 million pesos by Gemplus
between September 1999 and June 2001 (equivalent to about US $3.3 million). The
Claimants subsequently received from their Concessionaire dividends and the return of
share capital totalling 39.4 million pesos, being 23.5 million for Talsud and 15.9 million

for the Gemplus Claimants by 30 December 2002.

Part 1 — Page 3

1-14

1-18

In October 2001, the Claimants complained to the Respondent of the unlawful treatment
of their Concessionaire (as they saw it). Further complaints followed; but no amicable

resolution of such complaints was reached between the Claimants and the Respondent.

On 10 August 2004, the Gemplus Claimants and Talsud simultaneously filed two
Requests for Arbitration with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”). Both Requests were registered by the ICSID
Secretariat on 29 September 2004. Following the constitution of the Tribunal on 9
March 2005, it was agreed that the cases would be determined by the same tribunal and

would be heard and dealt with together in as far as it remained practicable to do so.

The Claimants request a single award in these two cases, to which the Respondent has

consented as to form.

In summary, the Respondent challenged the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to decide the
Claimants’ claims (later limited to the Gemplus Claimants); and it also disputed

liability, causation and the compensation claimed by all the Claimants.

(03) THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS

The two arbitration agreements separately invoked by the Claimants are contained,
respectively in Article 9 of the France BIT (as to the Gemplus Claimants) and Article 10
of the Argentina BIT (as to Talsud). These provide as follows, as translated into English

from the original texts in French and Spanish:

Part 1 — Page 4

(A)

The “France BIT”

“Article 9

Resolution of Disputes between an Investor of one of the Contracting
Parties and the other Contracting Party

This Article only applies to disputes between one Contracting
Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party in relation to
an alleged breach by the Contracting Party under this Agreement

which causes loss or damage to the investor or his investment.

In relation to submission of a claim to arbitration:

a) An investor of one of the Contracting Parties may not
allege that the other Contracting Party has breached an
obligation under this Agreement, both in arbitration
proceedings in accordance with this Article and in
proceedings before a competent judicial or administrative
tribunal of the former Contracting Party who is party to the

dispute;

b) Also, when a company from one of the Contracting Parties,
which is a legal person owned or controlled by an investor
from the other Contracting Party, alleges, during the
course of proceedings before a competent judicial or
administrative tribunal of the Contracting Party involved in
the proceedings, that the Contracting Party has breached
an obligation under this Agreement, the investor may not
allege the same breach in arbitration proceedings under

this Article.

Any dispute under this Article shall be settled amicably between

the Parties concerned.

A dispute under this Article may be submitted to arbitration,
provided that six months have passed since the events giving rise
to the request for arbitration occurs, but in any event no later than
four years from the date when the investor first became aware or
should have become aware of the events giving rise to the dispute,
and that the investor has delivered to the Contracting Party that is
a party to the dispute written notification of its intention to submit

a claim to arbitration at least 60 days in advance:

Part 1 — Page 5

i) before the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“The Centre”), established under the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals from other States (“the
ICSID Convention”), if the investor’s Contracting Party
and the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute
are both signatories to the ICSID Convention;

ti) before the Centre in accordance with the Rules of
the Additional Facility of ICSID, if either the Contracting
Party of the investor or the Contracting Party which is a
party to the dispute but not both is a party to the ICSID
Convention;

iii) before an ad hoc arbitration tribunal constituted in
accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law
(“UNCITRAL”);

iv) before the International Chamber of Commerce, by
an ad hoc tribunal constituted in accordance with its
arbitration rules.

The arbitration shall be governed by the applicable rules of
arbitration except to the extent modified by this Article.

Unless otherwise agreed between the Parties to the dispute, the
arbitration tribunal shall be composed of three members. Each
disputing party shall nominate one member and two members will
agree on the appointment of a third member, who shall act as
president.

The members of the tribunal shall have experience in international
law and in investment matters.

Where an arbitration has not been constituted within 90 days of
the date and the claim was submitted to arbitration, either because
one disputing party has not nominated a member or because the
two nominated members have not agreed a president, the Secretary
General of ICSID, at the request of any one of the disputing
Parties, shall appoint at his discretion the member or members not
yet appointed. However, in appointing the president, the Secretary
General of ICSID shall ensure that the president is not a national
of one of the Contracting Parties.

Part 1 — Page 6

(B)

A tribunal constituted in accordance with this Article shall decide
the dispute by majority vote in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement and any applicable rules and principles of international
law.

Arbitration awards may provide for the following types of remedy:

a) a declaration that the Contracting Party has breached its
obligations under this Agreement;

b) monetary indemnification including interest incurred from
the occurrence of the loss or damage to the date of the
payment;

c) restitution in kind, where this is appropriate, except if the

Contracting Party pays monetary indemnification in place
of restitution where such restitution is not feasible; and

d) with the consent of both disputing Parties, any other form
of remedy.

Arbitral awards shall be final and binding only on the disputing
Parties and only in respect of the particular case.

The final award shall only be published with the written consent of
both disputing Parties.

An arbitration tribunal cannot order a Contracting Party to pay
punitive damages.”

The “Argentina BIT”

“Article 10: Dispute Settlement between an Investor and the Contracting
Party which has received the Investment

1.

All disputes arising from the provisions of this Agreement between
an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting
Party, shall, as far as possible, be resolved amicably or by
negotiation.

This Article and the corresponding Annex establish a mechanism
for the resolution of investment disputes, which arise from the date

of entry into force of this Agreement, and ensure both equal

Part 1 — Page 7

treatment between investors from the Contracting Parties in
accordance with the principle of international reciprocity and due
process before an impartial arbitration tribunal, when
appropriate.

If the dispute has not been resolved within six months of the date
when the relevant disputing party raised the dispute, it may be
submitted, at the investor’s request:

- to the competent court of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the investment was made; or

- to international arbitration under the terms and conditions
established in paragraph (4).

Once an investor has submitted the dispute to the jurisdiction of
the Contracting Party involved or to international arbitration, the
election of either of these procedures shall be final.

The investor shall notify in writing the Contracting Party of its
intention to submit the dispute to international arbitration at least
90 days in advance, a term which may run parallel to the second
half of the term to which paragraph (3) refers.

In the event of recourse to international arbitration, the investor
may submit the dispute under:

a) the International Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals from
other States, signed in Washington on 18 March 1965,
(‘the ICSID Convention”), when both Contracting Parties
are signatories thereof; the Rules of the Additional Facility
of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (“ICSID”) when one of the Contract Parties is a
signatory of the ICSID Convention; or

b) the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), approved by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on 15 December,
1976.

The arbitration body shall rule on the disputes submitted for its
consideration on the basis of the provisions of this Agreement and
the applicable rules and principles of international law. The
interpretation of a provision in this Agreement made by the
Contracting Parties, by mutual agreement in writing, shall be

Part 1 — Page 8

binding upon any arbitration body established in accordance with
this Agreement.

6. The arbitration award shall be limited to determining whether a
Contracting Party has breached this Agreement, whether this
breach has caused a loss to the investor and, if so:-

a) fix the amount of compensatory indemnification for the
damage suffered;

b) restitution of property or, if that is not possible, the
corresponding compensatory indemnification.

c) any applicable interest.
The arbitration body may not order payment of punitive damages.

The award shall not affect the rights of any third Parties under
applicable local legislation.

7. Arbitration awards shall be final and binding for the Parties to the
dispute. Each Contracting Party shall enforce them pursuant to its
legislation; otherwise the investor may have recourse to
enforcement of an arbitration award under the ICSID Convention,
the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, signed in New York on
10 June 1958 (“New York Convention”) or the Inter-American
Convention on International Commercial Arbitration, signed in
Panama, on 30 January, 1975 (“Inter-American Convention”).
For the purposes of Article One of the New York Convention, the
claim submitted to arbitration shall be held to have arisen from a
commercial relationship or transaction.

8. In all investment arbitrations, a Contracting Party may not allege,
either as defence, counterclaim, objection to compensation or any
other action, that the investor received or will receive, pursuant to
an insurance contract or warranty agreement, indemnification of
other compensation for all or part of the alleged loss.”

ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules: It was agreed by the Parties that these
proceedings were subject to the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules in force
since 1 January 2003, except to the extent modified in the Argentina BIT and France

BIT, respectively, at the First Session: see below.

Part 1 — Page 9

(It is agreed that the Annex to the Argentina BIT is not relevant for present purposes:

see Article 10(2) of the Argentina BIT cited above).

(04) THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

1-20. The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted on 9 March 2005 and was comprised of three

members:

(1) L. Yves Fortier, CC, QC, a national of Canada, appointed as Arbitrator by
the Claimants by letter dated 12 November 2004, of Ogilvy Renault LLP,
now of | Place Ville Marie, Suite 2500, Montréal QC, H3B 1R1, Canada;

(2) Eduardo Magallén Gomez, a national of Mexico, appointed as Arbitrator
by the Respondent by letter dated 12 January 2005, of Magallén, Peniche
y Del Pino Abogados, Fuego 719, Col. Jardines del Pedregal, México, DF
01900, Mexico; and

1-21 Ms Evgeniya Rubinina and Mr Tomas Solis were successively appointed Secretaries to
the Tribunal; and Ms Alison G. FitzGerald was appointed, by consent of the Parties, as

Administrative Assistant to the Tribunal.

(05) THE ARBITRAL PROCEDURE

1-22 The First Session: The First Session was held on 4 May 2005 at the seat of the Centre in

Part 1 — Page 10

1-23

1-24

1-26

1-27

It was further agreed that both arbitrations should be determined by the same tribunal
and that the cases should be conjoined, i.e. heard and decided together in so far as it was
practicable to do so. It was agreed, at that stage and subject to further order, that
questions concerning the merits and those concerning damages should be considered
separately, in successive phases of these proceedings. (As recited below, this order for

bifurcation was later superseded by an order for “debifurcation”).

Written Phase: The Parties agreed that there would be four consecutive written
pleadings within each phase of the proceedings: a Memorial by the Claimant, a Counter-
Memorial by the Respondent, a Reply and a Rejoinder. It was further agreed that the
Parties would present their complete case with their Memorial and Counter-Memorial,
respectively, including all documentary evidence, witness statements, and expert

reports.

Memorials: In the first written phase the Claimants filed their Memorial on 13 October
2005 (“Memorial”); the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on 31 May 2006
(“Counter-Memorial”); the Claimants filed their Reply on 12 October 2006 (“Reply”);
and the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on 12 April 2007 (“Rejoinder”). In the second
written phase, the Claimants filed their Memorial on Quantum on 12 April 2007
(“Quan. Mem.”); the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Quantum on 19 July
2007 (“Quan. CM”); the Claimants filed their Reply on Quantum on 14 September 2007
(“Quan. Rep.”); and the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Quantum on 16 November
2007 (Quan. Rej.”).

Witness Statements: The following written witness statements were submitted by the
Claimants: the witness statement of Mr José Eduardo Salgado; the first, second, and
third witness statements of Mr Roberto Armando Siegrist; the first, second and third
witness statements of Mr Victor Tafariol; the first and second witness statements of Ms

Maria Elena Barrera Sanchez; and the witness statement of Mr José Rojas.

The written witness statement of Mr Guillermo Bilbao Gonzalez was also submitted by

the Claimants; but the Claimants did not make this witness available for cross-

Part 1 — Page 11

examination as requested by the Respondent. Accordingly, the Tribunal has placed no

reliance upon it for the purpose of the decisions recorded in this Award.

The following written witness statements were submitted by the Respondent: the
witness statement of Mr Javier Martin Gallardo Guzman, the witness statement of Ms
Maria Jimena Valverde Valdés, the witness statement of Ms Maria de la Esperanza
Guadalupe Gomez Mont Urueta, the witness statement of Dr Herminio Blanco
Mendoza,; the witness statement of Mr Guillermo Gonzalez Lozano; a letter from Mr
Miguel B. de Erice Rodriguez dated 25 February 2008; and a letter from Mr Adolfo
Durafiona dated 13 March 2008.

Expert Reports: The following expert reports were submitted by the Claimants: the
expert opinion of Mr Patrick Kinsch, the expert opinion of Mr José Antonio Chavez
Vargas, the expert opinion of Mr Luis Enrique Graham Tapia, the LECG/Horwath letter
of 7 October 2005, the LECG/Horwath letter of 9 October 2006, the LECG/Horwath
report of 27 April 2007, and the LECG/Horwath report of 12 September 2007.

The following expert reports were submitted by the Respondent: the expert opinion of
Dr. Carla Huerta, the Pablo Rién & Associates report of 18 July 2007, and the Pablo
Rion & Associates report of 13 November 2007.

“Debifurcation”: By letter dated 17 January 2007, the Claimants requested that the
proceedings be “debifurcated”, i.e. to re-join the questions of liability and quantum.

The Respondent opposed this request by letter dated 19 January 2007.

One month later, by letter dated 14 February 2007, the Claimants supplemented their
reasons for joining the issues of liability and quantum in reply to the Respondent’s

objection.

On 20 February 2007, the Tribunal held a procedural meeting by telephone conference-
call during which the Parties further expressed their views on the issue of

“debifurcation”.

Part 1 — Page 12

By letter dated 9 March 2007, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to
“debifurcate”, re-joining the questions of liability and quantum. The Tribunal further
fixed the dates for the joined hearing on liability and quantum from 18 February to 29

February 2008.

Main Hearing: The first part of the main hearing took place over eight days from 18

Post-Hearing Submissions: By letter dated 10 March 2008, the Tribunal invited the
Parties to provide written post-hearing submissions by 4 April 2008 and to address

certain queries set out by the Tribunal in its letter, in their respective submissions.

On 4 April 2008, the Parties each submitted written post-hearing submissions in

accordance with the Tribunal’s request.

Costs Submissions: Upon the conclusion of the first part of the main hearing in February

2008, the Tribunal ordered the Parties to provide written submissions on costs.

During the second part of the main hearing on 28 May 2008, the Tribunal extended the

1-48 By letter dated 4 November 2008, the Respondent submitted its reply to the Claimants’

objections.

1-49 Closure of the Proceedings: By letter dated 30 November 2009, further to the letter

dated 1 October 2008, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the

Tribunal had declared the proceeding closed in accordance with Article 44(1) of the

PART II: THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES

(01) INTRODUCTION

The Parties’ written and oral submissions in these arbitration proceedings are very
extensive. The Tribunal has, where convenient, reproduced parts of the Parties’
submissions in the body of this Award, as far as possible in the Parties’ own original
words (to facilitate this Award’s two versions in English and Spanish). It is of course
not possible to incorporate in this Award the entirety of the Parties’ submissions, both

written and oral, made during the course of these arbitration proceedings.

The summaries below are made for the sole purpose of explaining the Tribunal’s
general approach in this Award. The Tribunal has nevertheless considered the full
submissions of the Parties in identifying the principal issues listed below and in arriving

at its decisions on all issues addressed in this Award.

As indicated below, the determination of many of these issues is significantly dependent
upon facts. For this reason, the Tribunal’s approach is first determined by its findings of

fact, set out in Part IV of this Award.

(02) LIST OF PRINCIPAL ISSUES

The following principal issues arise from the Claimants’ Claims and the Respondent’s
Defence, listing them in turn: (A) Jurisdiction; (B) Liability - General Approach; (C)

Fair and Equitable Treatment; (D) Expropriation; (E) Full Protection and Security; (F)

Part II— Page 1

2-5

2-6

2-7

NLF/MEN Treatment; (G) Causation and Fault; (H) Damages — General Approach; (I)
Lost Future Profits; (J) Past Payments to Claimants; (K) Currency and Interest; and (L)

Legal and Arbitration Costs.

(03) ISSUE A: JURISDICTION

This first issue arises in connection with the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article 45(4)
of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. Whilst the Respondent originally
raised jurisdictional objections in connection with both Talsud and the Gemplus
Claimants’ claims, it has maintained its objections only in respect of the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction over the latter. This issue is addressed below in Part V of this Award.

@) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent’s jurisdictional claim relates to the Gemplus Claimants’ “standing” to
bring their claim. Specifically, the Respondent contends that the continuous chain of
ownership and nationality of the Gemplus Claimants’ claims has been broken with the
legal effect, under international law and the France BIT, that each of the Gemplus

Claimants lacks any standing to advance its claim in these proceedings.
(ii) The Claimants’ Case

The Gemplus Claimants contend that the Respondent’s jurisdictional arguments are
flawed in several respects. In essence, the Gemplus Claimants submit that the several
corporate transactions entered into by the Gemplus Claimants prior to and following the
filing of their Request for Arbitration did not affect their right respectively to present
their claim under the France BIT. In the alternative, they submit that in the event this

right was lost by Gemplus, it is held by SLP.

Part II— Page 2

(04) ISSUE B: LIABILITY - GENERAL APPROACH

2-8

2-9

2-10

This issue addresses the general approach to the merits espoused by each of the Parties,
including the legal character of the claims presented, the relevance of the domestic
proceedings involving the Concessionaire in Mexico, the contractual landscape to the
Claimants’ claims and the applicable standard of proof. This issue is addressed below in

Part VI of this Award.

(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants submit that their claims are treaty-based claims, but that it is open to the
Tribunal to take into account the underlying factual circumstances of these claims,
including the contractual relationship between the Concessionaire and the Respondent,
relying for support in this regard on the ICSID awards in Compajiia de Aguas del
Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal SA v. Argentine Republic and Azurix v. Argentina.
The Claimants further submit that the Respondent’s approach in regard to the matter of
deference owed by this Tribunal to the governmental decisions of the Respondent is
“misconceived”, contending that no measure of deference is justified in this case.
Finally, as regards the standard of proof, the Claimants contend that the standard

applicable is set forth in the two BITs.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ claims are contract claims, not treaty
claims, and that these claims fall within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Mexican courts.
Even if the claims could be treated as treaty claims, the Respondent submits that this
Tribunal must have “due deference” to governmental decisions, relying upon the
standard of deference articulated by the tribunal in S.D. Myers v. Canada. Finally, as
regards the applicable standard of proof, the Respondent contends that the Claimants
face a heavier burden in making out their claims for treaty breach than is normally the

case in proving breach of contract, characterizing the standard of proof as “high”.

Part II— Page 3

(05) ISSUE C: FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

2-11

2-12

2-13

2-14

2-15

This issue relates to the first of the Claimants’ principal claims for treaty breach and in
particular whether the Respondent treated the Claimants unfairly and inequitably in
breach of Article 3 of the Argentina BIT and Article 4 of the France BIT. This issue is
addressed below in Part VII of this Award.

(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants plead their fair and equitable treatment claim in three parts: (1)
transparency and protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations; (2) due process
and the absence of arbitration; and (3) good faith. The Claimants also plead a fourth
argument as regards (4) “arbitrary and/or discriminatory measures or to harm the

management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or order of Talsud’s investment”.

As regards the first part, the Claimants contend that the measures taken by Mexico
following the arrest of Mr Cavallo (on 24 August 2000) were neither consistent nor
transparent, relying on the principles of transparency and predictability articulated by

the tribunals in Metalclad v. Mexico and Tecmed v. Mexico.

As regards the second part, the Claimants submit that the Respondent interfered with
their investment through the technical and administrative interventions (from 29 August
2000 onwards), described as unlawful, arbitrary and capricious and having no
justification by reason or necessity. The subsequent Requisition of the Concessionaire
(on 25 June 2001) and the Revocation of the Concession (on 13 December 2002) are
described as further infringements of the fair and equitable treatment standard, being

arbitrary and carried out by the Respondent without due process.

As regards the third part, the Claimants contend that the various acts of the Respondent
beginning on 21 August 2000 up to the Revocation of the Concession on 13 December

2002 evidence a material lack of good faith by the Respondent.

Part II— Page 4

2-16

2-17

2-18

2-19

2-20

Finally, as regards the last part in connection with the treatment of Talsud’s investment,
the Claimants invoke a distinct provision of the Argentina BIT (Article 3) which
precludes a Party to the BIT from prejudicing “the management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, or disposition” of an investor’s investments through arbitrary or
discriminatory measures. The Claimants rely on the same arguments in connection with
the arbitrariness of the acts of the Mexican authorities following the arrest of Mr

Cavallo on 24 August 2000.

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s response based on local remedies and, in
particular, its invocation of the Waste Management award as inapposite to the facts of
this case. The Claimants submit that they have not brought, nor have they participated
in, any legal proceedings before the Mexican courts; and, in any event, the Claimants
submit that the issue of local remedies is irrelevant in the case of a claim for

expropriation under both BITs.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent rejects each of the Claimants’ claims of unfair and inequitable
treatment. Beginning with the Claimants’ expectations, the Respondent maintains that
the Secretariat acted at all times on the basis of the criteria set forth in the legal
framework governing the Concession, exercising its legal rights and defending its

measures in the proper forum, i.e. the Mexican courts.

Turning to the Claimants’ due process argument, the Respondent submits that there is
simply no evidence that the Secretariat acted in “wilful disregard” of due process, citing
the standard for proving arbitrariness articulated by the International Court of Justice in

ELSI (United States of America v. Italy).

As concerns the third element of the Claimants’ claim, the Respondent contends that it
acted at all times in good faith, pointing also to the affirmation of its reasons for
intervention in the course of the Revocation proceedings and later the legal challenge of

the administrative intervention.

Part II— Page 5

2-21

Finally, the Respondent contends, on the basis of the principles set forth in Azinian v.
Mexico and Waste Management v. Mexico (among other legal materials), that it is not
open to the Claimants to impugn acts of the Secretariat which have been validated by
the Mexican courts; nor may this Tribunal review the decisions of those courts for any
error in applying domestic law. The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ argument
that the availability of local remedies is relevant only in the case of a fair and equitable
treatment claim and not in the case of an expropriation claim, submitting that the
tribunals in Azinian and Waste Management based the dismissal of the claimant’s

expropriation claim on the resort to local remedies.

(06) ISSUE D: EXPROPRIATION

2-22

2-23

This issue relates to the second of the Claimants’ principal claims for treaty breach and
in particular whether the Respondent expropriated the Claimants’ investment in
violation of the requirements set forth in Article 5 of the Argentina and France BITs.

This issue is addressed below in Part VIII of this Award.
(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants submit that the measures taken by the Respondent during the period
prior to the Revocation of the Concession amounted to an indirect expropriation of their
investment and (or in the alternative) that the Revocation constituted a direct
expropriation of their investment. The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s conduct
during this period fell outside any contractual scope and was a clear exercise of the
Respondent’s sovereign authority. The Claimants further contend that the Respondent’s
actions were unlawful because they were not justified on grounds of public interest or
utility, and they were not accompanied by the payment of adequate compensation, both

of which are requirements in the two BITs.

Part II — Page 6

2-24

2-25

2-26

2-27

2-28

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that the acts constituting expropriation
were lawful because they were taken pursuant to rights under the Concession
Agreement and Mexican law. In any event, the Claimants submit, relying on the
Tecmed v. Mexico award, that the Respondent’s acts were unjustified and

disproportionate, amounting therefore to unlawful expropriation.

Finally, relying upon the requirements of the two BITs in respect of the obligation to
pay compensation, the Claimants contend that the Respondent’s failure to pay
compensation to the Claimants in accordance with the fair market value of their

investment on its own renders the expropriation unlawful.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent denies that an expropriation claim can be made out on the facts of this
case, describing the various acts about which the Claimants complain as reasonable and
legitimate. The Respondent further submits, in particular with regard to the Requisition
and the Revocation, that it simply exercised a right or power contemplated in the

Concession Agreement.

The Respondent also submits, relying on Waste Management v. Mexico and Azurix
Corp. v. Argentina (among other awards), that where a state instrumentality has
contracted with an investment of a foreign investor, the tribunal must look at the terms
of the contract in order to determine whether the State is acting as co-contractor. In this
case, the Respondent submits that it possessed contractual rights of audit, inspection,
intervention, termination, requisition and revocation; and that the exercise of these
rights cannot be considered a termination or variance of the Concessionaire’s

contractual rights by means not contemplated by the Concession Agreement.

In the alternative, the Respondent contends that in the event that the Tribunal does not
accept its submission as to the circumstances which led to the exercise of the
Respondent’s legal rights, the resort to local remedies “in and of itself disposes of the

Claimants’ grievances”.

(07) ISSUE E: PROTECTION AND SECURITY

2-29

2-30

2-31

2-32

2-33

This issue relates to the third of the Claimants’ claims for treaty breach, namely whether
the Respondent granted the Claimants’ investment appropriate protection and security
consistent with Article 3 of the Argentina BIT and Article 4 of the France BIT. This

issue is addressed below in Part IX of this Award.

(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants submit that the scope of the full protection and security provisions in the
two BITs extend beyond protection from physical violence and threats and incorporates
a much broader requirement to protect the position of investors and their investments,
relying on the discussion of this issue in the awards in CME v. Czech Republic, Goetz v.

Burundi and Rankin v. Iran, among other cases.

In this regard, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s various acts and omissions
undermined the stability of the investment environment in which they had to operate
and frustrated their legitimate expectations, thereby giving rise to this independent claim
for breach of the Respondent’s obligations to accord full and complete protection and

security for their investment.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent rejects this claim as a “make weight”, cautioning that “full protection

and security” should not be compared with fair and equitable treatment.

The Respondent further relies upon the award in Asian Agricultural Products Limited v.
Republic of Sri Lanka in support of its submission that the concept of full protection and
security must not be read more broadly than its plain meaning, which refers to the
State’s obligation to afford protection to a foreign investor or its property in situations

of threatened harm, such as civil conflict or some other disturbance of the peace.

Part II— Page 8

(08) ISSUE F: NLF/MFN TREATMENT

2-34

2-35

2-36

This issue relates to the fourth and final of the Claimants’ claims for treaty breach,
albeit advanced as a conditional answer to a possible defence by the Respondent,
namely whether the Respondent granted to the Claimants no less favourable / most
favoured nation (“NLF/MFN”) treatment consistent with Article 3 of the Argentina BIT

and Article 4 of the France BIT. This issue is addressed below in Part X of this Award.
(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants contend that the Respondent is precluded from relying on the national
security exception in the Argentina BIT as a defence, by virtue of the MEN provision in

that BIT, because there is no national security exclusion in the France BIT.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ arguments in connection with these treaty
provisions are anticipatory of a defence not in fact advanced by the Respondent. As a
matter of principle, however, the Respondent disagrees that an MEN provision, such as
that contained in the Argentina BIT, can override a national security clause, such as

contained in the same Argentina BIT.

(09) ISSUE G: CAUSATION AND FAULT

2-37

This issue relates to the matter of causation in connection with the Claimants’ treaty
claims, in particular whether any unlawful act or omission by the Respondent caused the
Claimants’ loss and whether any fault of the Claimants contributed to that loss, such
that any amount of compensation should be reduced or extinguished. This issue is

addressed below in Part XI of this Award.

Part II— Page 9

2-38

2-39

2-40

(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants submit that they have suffered loss as a direct result of the Respondent’s
expropriation of their investments and the failure by the Respondent to provide fair and

equitable treatment and full protection and security in respect of their investments.

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s case that they contributed themselves to their
losses and that therefore any compensation should be reduced or extinguished

accordingly.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent contends that Article 39 of the International Law Commission’s draft
Articles on State Responsibility should preclude any recovery in these arbitrations
because the Claimants contributed to any injury they may have suffered because Talsud
was responsible for the appointment of Mr Cavallo as General Director of the
Concessionaire. In the Respondent’s submission, whatever prospects the Registry may
have had for public acceptance and viability (in August 2000) were destroyed by the

Cavallo incident.

In the alternative, the Respondent submits that any recovery should be reduced by 50%

to account for the Claimants’ contributory fault.

(10) ISSUE H: COMPENSATION — GENERAL APPROACH

2-42

This issue relates to the legal approaches respectively advanced by the Claimants and
the Respondent in respect of the Tribunal’s assessment of compensation, assuming a
finding of liability and causation on one of the above-described principal claims. This

issue is addressed below in Part XII of this Award.

Part II — Page 10

2-43

2-44

(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants’ primary submission is that the market value measure of compensation
contained in the two BITs is virtually identical and reflects the standard of
compensation prescribed by the Permanent Court of International Justice (“PCI”) in the
Chorzéw Factory case for unlawful expropriations, that is full reparation so as to “wipe
out all the consequences of the unlawful act” and re-establish the situation which likely
would have existed if that unlawful act had not been committed. This standard, the

Claimants’ submit, includes the potential to recover future lost profits.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent agrees with the Claimants that the standard of compensation contained
in the BITs is materially the same and reflects the standard set forth by the PCIJ in
Chorzéw Factory. However, the Respondent contests the Claimants’ assertion that this
standard entitles the Claimants to recover compensation prescribed in the BIT, plus loss

of profits.

(11) ISSUE I: COMPENSATION — LOST FUTURE PROFITS

2-45

2-46

This issue relates to the particular method of calculating damages for a breach of one or
both of the BITs advocated respectively by the Parties. This issue is addressed below in
Part XIII of this Award.

(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants submit that where an asset is not publicly traded and there is no open
market for it, as in this case, its value must be established by reference to its “likely
value in a hypothetical market”. Drawing on the arbitral jurisprudence of the U.S.-Iran
Claims Tribunal, the Claimants consider that the market value is the price that a willing

buyer would pay to a willing seller in circumstances in which each had good

Part II — Page 11

2-47

2-48

2-49

2-50

2-51

2-52

information, each desired to maximize his financial gain and neither was under duress

or threat.

Based on this methodology, the Claimants contend that the ‘Income Approach’, which
relies on a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model, is the most appropriate method to

value their investments.

The Claimants submit that the relevant date from which to calculate compensation,
under the two BITs, is the date immediately preceding the acts or omissions that
rendered the expropriation irreversible. This date is, in the Claimants’ submission, no
later than 20 August 2000, the date preceding the Respondent’s decision on 21 August

2000 to postpone the deadline for the registration of used vehicles.

Whilst the Claimants assess the value of their investments as at two other potential
valuation dates put to them by the Tribunal, i.e. 27 June 2001 and 13 December 2002,
the Claimants maintain their submission that a DCF analysis is the only method

available to achieve full reparation for their losses in this case.

With regard to the Claimants’ other treaty claims, it is submitted that the same standard
of compensation applies, relying upon the tribunal’s decision in the Vivendi v. Argentina
award to the effect that the level of damages flowing from different treaty breaches was

equivalent.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent submits that, in the circumstances of this case, the ‘asset value’ and
‘declared tax value’ methods should be preferred over the DCF method. Highlighting
the difficulties associated with exclusive reliance on the DCF method, also identified in
awards by the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, the Respondent contends that the DCF
method is inappropriate here because there is no proven track record of profitable

operations at the Claimants’ chosen valuation date.

As to the alternative potential valuation dates identified by the Tribunal, the Respondent

contends that the Claimants’ valuation methodology is similarly inappropriate.

Part II — Page 12

2-53

Finally, the Respondent submits that, consistent with the Chorzéw Factory case, the
results of one valuation method must be tested against the results of the other methods

in order to avoid “speculative or undue awards of damages”.

(12) ISSUE J: PAST PAYMENTS TO CLAIMANTS

2-54

2-55

2-56

This issue relates to the sum of payments effected by the Respondent to the Claimants
prior to the termination of the Concession, and the appropriate accounting of that sum in
connection with the amounts claimed as compensation by the Claimants in these

proceedings. This issue is addressed below in Part XIV of this Award.
(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants contend that the losses which they sustained due to the Respondent’s
unlawful acts and omissions far exceeds the amounts disbursed to the Claimants through

cash distributions effected by the Respondent.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent submits that the Claimants were, in effect, made whole by the

disbursements made to the Claimants in the form of dividends and return of capital.

(13) ISSUE K: CURRENCY AND INTEREST

2-57

This issue relates to the appropriate currency, rate and amount of pre- and post-award
interest that may be owing on any principal amount awarded by the Tribunal as

compensation. This issue is addressed below in Part XVI of this Award.

Part II — Page 13

2-58

2-59

(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants submit that the BITs respectively require interest at a “reasonable
commercial rate” and at “the applicable market rate”. Additionally, while the BITs are
silent on whether interest should be compounded, the Claimants contend that current
arbitral practice supports the compounding of interest. As a result, the Claimants
identify the CETES 364 day Mexican government bond rate, compounded annually, as
the appropriate rate applicable to pre-award interest, with the award expressed in US

dollars.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent argues that interest should be calculated according to the Mexican
CETES rates, but submits that the 28-day rate is a more commonly used indicator than
the 364 day rate; and that it would satisfy the requirements of the BITs. The
Respondent objects to the compounding of interest on any amount awarded to the
Claimants, submitting that an award of simple interest is adequate in the circumstances

of these arbitrations.

(14) ISSUE L: LEGAL AND ARBITRATION COSTS

2-60

2-61

This issue relates to the allocation and amount, if any, of costs amongst the Parties
associated with these arbitration proceedings. This issue is addressed below in Part

XVII of this Award.

(i) The Claimants’ Case

The Claimants begin their submissions on costs with the general principle that the
losing party should pay the reasonable costs incurred by the successful party in these

proceedings. However, in any event, the Claimants contend that the Respondent should

Part II — Page 14

2-62

2-63

bear the costs which the Claimants incurred in order to address the Respondent’s

jurisdictional objections and to attend the supplemental hearing on 28 May 2008.
(ii) The Respondent’s Case

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ arguments on costs assume, wrongly, that
the measures taken by Mexico were unlawful. The Respondent further contends that its
defence against the Claimants’ claims was conducted responsibly, rejecting any
suggestion that it presented its case deficiently. The Respondent adds that if the
Tribunal should decide that this is a case in which the successful claimants ought to
recover costs, costs should at a minimum be awarded in the Respondent’s favour in
respect of the expenses occasioned by Mr. Taiariol’s testimony at the supplemental

hearing.

Conclusion & Summary and Operative Part: The Tribunal sets outs its “Conclusion
and Summary” in Part XV; and this Award’s Operative Part is contained in Part XVIII

below.

PART III: THE PRINCIPAL TEXTS

(01) INTRODUCTION

3-1 It is necessary here to set out, in full, relevant extracts from the two principal texts to
which reference is made later below: the France BIT (as regards the Gemplus

Claimants) and the Argentina BIT (as regards Talsud).

(02) THE FRANCE BIT

3-2 Preamble: The France BIT provides in its preamble that the Contracting Parties are
“DESIRING to strengthen their economic co-operation between the two States and to
create favourable conditions for Mexican investments in France and French investments
in Mexico” and “CONVINCED that promoting and protecting such investments will
stimulate transfers of capital and technology between the two countries in the interests

of their economic development”.
3-3 Article 2: Article 2 sets out the scope of application of the BIT as follows:

“ARTICLE 2
Scope of Application of this Agreement
I. It is understood that investments covered by this Agreement are those
which have already been made or might be made after this Agreement

enters into force, in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party on
whose territory or in whose maritime zone the investments are made.

Part III — Page |

2. This Agreement applies to the territory and maritime zone of each of the
Contracting Parties.

3. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted so as to prevent either
Contracting Party from taking any measure to control investments made
by foreign investors and the way in which these investors carry out their
investments, within the framework of measures aiming to preserve and
encourage cultural and linguistic diversity.”

3-4 Articles 4 and 5: Articles 4 and 5 set out the substantive protections invoked in part by

the Gemplus Claimants, providing in their entirety as follows:

“ARTICLE 4
Protection and Treatment of Investments

I. Each of the Contracting Parties undertakes to ensure, within its territory
and its maritime zone, a fair and equitable treatment, in accordance with
principles of International Law, of investments made by investors of the
other Contracting Party and shall ensure that the exercise of their
recognized rights shall not be impeded either in law or in practice.

2. Each of the Contracting Parties shall grant, within its territory and
maritime zone, to investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment no
less favourable than it would grant its own investors or treatment granted
to investors of the Most Favoured Nation, if the latter is more favourable,
with regard to their investments and the operation, administration,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposition of such investments.

Notwithstanding the principle of national treatment, each of the
Contracting Parties may require an investor from the other Contracting
Party, or a company located in its territory which is owned or controlled
by said investor, to provide routine information relating to its investments
for statistical purposes.

This treatment shall not, however, extend to privileges granted by a
Contracting Party to investors from a third State pursuant to its
participation or its association with a free trade area, a customs union, a
common market or any other form of regional economic organization.

The provisions of this article shall not apply to fiscal matters.
3. Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party within the
territory or the maritime zone of the other Contracting Party shall benefit

from full and complete protection and security within the territory and
maritime zone.

Part III — Page 2

Each Contracting Party shall favourably examine, within the framework
of its domestic law, applications for the entry and the authorization to
reside, work and travel presented by nationals of a Contracting Party,
pursuant to an investment made within the territory or maritime zone of
the other Contracting Party.”

“ARTICLE 5
Expropriation and Indemnification

Neither Contracting Party shall nationalize or expropriate directly or
indirectly, or take any other measure of equivalent effect, with respect to
an investment of the other Contracting Party in its territory or its maritime
zone, except:

i) for reasons of public interest;
ii) provided that such measures are non-discriminatory;
iii) in accordance with due process;

iv) on payment of indemnification in accordance with the provisions
of paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.

Indemnification shall be paid without delay, shall be freely transferable
and fully realizable.

The indemnification shall be equivalent to the fair market value or, in the
absence of such value, to the actual value of the expropriated or
nationalized investment immediately before the expropriation or
nationalization was carried out and shall not reflect any changes in the
value which arise as a result of the expropriation becoming known prior
to the date of expropriation. Valuation criteria shall include going
concern value, asset value including the declared tax value of tangible
property and any other criteria which, in the circumstances, are
appropriate to determine fair market value. The aforementioned
indemnification, its amount and its mode of payment shall be fixed no later
than the date of deprivation. Indemnification will be subject to interest
calculated at the applicable rate until the date of payment.”

Part III— Page 3

(03) THE ARGENTINA BIT

3-5 Preamble: The preamble to the Argentina BIT is somewhat more extensive, providing

as follows:

“DESIRING to strengthen the ties of friendship between their nations and
seeking to extend and intensify the economic relationship between the
Contracting Parties, particularly with regard to the investments made by
investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting
Party;

ACKNOWLEDGING that a bilateral agreement on the promotion and
protection of investments is necessary to foster economic development and
stimulate the flow of capital and technology between the Contracting
Parties;

WISHING to create favourable conditions for investment of investors from
one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party, in
accordance with the principle of international reciprocity;”

3-6 Article 2: Article 2 sets out the scope of application of the Argentina BIT, providing as

follows:

“ARTICLE 2. Scope of Application

I. This Agreement applies to measures adopted or maintained by a
Contracting Party in relation to the investors of a Contracting Party as
regards its investments and the investments made by those investors in the
territory of the other Contracting Party.

2. This Agreement applies to the whole territory of the Contracting Parties
as defined in Article First, paragraph (6). The provisions of this
Agreement shall prevail over any incompatible rule which exists in the
domestic law of the Contracting Parties.

3. With regard to the provisions foreseen in Articles Fourth and Tenth,
natural persons who are nationals of one Contracting Party and who are
domiciled in the territory of the other Contracting Party in which the
investment is located, may only avail themselves of the treatment granted
by this Contracting Party to its own nationals.

Part III — Page 4

3-7

4, This Agreement shall apply to all investments made before or after its
entry into force, but the provisions of this Agreement shall not be
applicable to any disputes, claims or differences of any kind which arose
before the date of its entry into force.

5. This Agreement shall not apply to:

a economic activities reserved to the State pursuant to the legislation
of each Contracting Party;

b. measures adopted by a Contracting Party for reasons of national
security or public order;

c financial services except as authorized by the legislation of each
Contracting Party.

6. Article Third shall not apply to any measure which a Contracting Party
still maintains pursuant to its legislation in force at the time this
Agreement enters into force. As of this date, any incompatible measure
which a Contracting Party adopts shall not be more restrictive than those
in place at the time this Agreement enters into force.”

Articles 3 and 5: Articles 3 and 5 set out the substantive protections invoked in part by

Talsud, providing in their entirety as follows:

“ARTICLE 3. National Treatment and Most Favoured Nation Treatment

1.- Each Contracting Party shall ensure at all times a fair and equitable
treatment of all investors and investments of investors of the other
Contracting Party, and shall not damage the management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposition of their investments through arbitrary or
discriminatory measures.

2.- Each Contracting Party, after admitting in its territory investments from
investors of the other Contracting Party, shall provide full legal protection
to those investors and their investments and shall grant them a treatment
no less favourable than that granted to investors and investments of its
own investors or investors from third States.

3.- If a Contracting Party grants special treatment to investors or investments
of investors coming from a third State, as a result of agreements
containing provisions to avoid double taxation, create free trade areas,
customs unions, common markets, regional agreements, economic or
monetary unions or other similar institutions, that Contracting Party shall
not be obliged to grant such treatment to investors or investments of
investors of the other Contracting Party.

Part III— Page 5

Each Contracting Party shall grant the investors of the other Contracting
Party, in respect of investments which suffer losses in their territory due to
armed conflicts, a state of national emergency or insurrection, no less
favourable treatment than that granted to its own investors or to investors
of a third State, with regard to restitution, indemnification, compensation
or other redress.”

“ARTICLE 5. Expropriation and Indemnification

1.-

Neither of the Contracting Parties may nationalize or expropriate, either
directly or indirectly, an investment of an investor of the other Contracting
Party in its territory or adopt any measures equivalent to the
expropriation or nationalization of that investment, except:

a) for reasons of public utility;
b) on a non-discriminatory basis;
c) in accordance with due process; and

d) with indemnification, pursuant to paragraphs (2) through (4).

The indemnification shall be equivalent to the market value of the
expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory measure
was implemented (“date of expropriation”) or before the expropriatory
measure was made public. The valuation criteria shall include current
value, declared tax value of tangible goods, and other criteria that are
appropriate to determine market value.

Indemnification shall be paid without delay, fully realizable and freely
transferable.

The amount paid shall be no less than the equivalent amount which would
have been paid as indemnification on the date of expropriation in a freely-
convertible currency on the international financial market, that currency
having been converted to the standard market quotation on the date of
valuation, plus interest corresponding to a reasonable commercial rate for
that currency until the date of payment.”

THE PRINCIPAL CHRONOLOGY

As already indicated, the Tribunal sets out below the principal factual basis for its
decisions in this Award in the form of an overall chronology. Where disputed by the
Parties, the Tribunal has established these facts primarily from the contemporary
documentation adduced in evidence by the Parties, supplemented by testimony of their
factual witnesses (both oral and written) as provided to the Tribunal in these arbitration

proceedings.

Many of the events in this chronology are concurrent and several overlap significantly.
It is therefore convenient at times to break up the chronology into different subjects to
avoid unnecessary repetition as far as possible. Where texts are quoted from the original
Spanish, the quotations are taken from English translations, either agreed between the

Parties or settled by the Tribunal.

(01) Antecedents to the National Vehicle Registry

1995: The chronology starts in 1995, with the renewed initiative within Mexico for a
national vehicle registry. It was prompted, in part, by a concern that the absence of such
a registry facilitated criminal activity, particularly car-theft and organized crime
generally. This initiative was included in the national development programme
advanced in 1995 by the newly-elected President of Mexico (Mr Ernesto Zedillo of the
PRI) and the Federal Government, adopting a proposal made by the opposition PAN.
party. National vehicle registries had been proposed earlier in Mexico; but none of these
proposals had succeeded. At this time, some states operated their own state registry (but
others did not); such regional systems operated with rudimentary technology; there was
no co-ordination between states or between states and federal agencies; and there was

no comprehensive registration of used vehicles.

Part IV — Page 3

4-14

4-15

4-16

4-17

4-18

The national development programme described the principal objectives for the new
national vehicle registry as two-fold: first, protecting the property assets of Mexican
citizens; and second, combating crime. Vehicles represented (then as now) an important
part of property owned by Mexicans; and there were increasing social concerns over the
widespread theft of vehicles, as well as related criminal activity such as kidnappings and
robberies. This had led to strong public support for the creation of a secure national
database containing all relevant information relating to the ownership of both used and

new vehicles, as well as all vehicles imported into Mexico.

As all prior initiatives had failed, it was determined within the Federal Government that,
under this new proposal, the national vehicle registry should be operated by a private

concessionaire.

(02) The National Vehicle Registry Act

1997: In December 1997, President Zedillo's Federal Government introduced a bill to
create the National Registry of Motor Vehicles (the “Registry”, also known as “Renave”
but here distinct from the future Concessionaire). The National Vehicle Registry Act
(the “Act”) was approved by Mexico's Congress of the Union in April 1998 and
published in the Official Bulletin on 2 June 1998. The regulations supplementing the
Act were published on 27 April 2000.

The Act: The purpose of the Act was to put into place a modern and efficient national
system of vehicle registration to safeguard the vehicular property of Mexican citizens,
provide security with regard to commercial transactions involving vehicles and prevent

illegal vehicle trade in Mexico.

The Act specifically empowered the Secretariat to undertake certain activities for the

proper operation of the Registry, including the following:

Part IV — Page 4

4-19

4-20

4-21

To establish the rules to which the reception, storage and transmission of
the Registry’s information should be subject and, in general, the operation,
functioning and administration of the public service it provides;

To operate and, as the case may be, to concession and regulate the
Registry’s operation;

To enter into coordination agreements with the state and Federal District
governments, in order to facilitate the Registry’s coverage, to try to
achieve its proper functioning and effect the exchange of information;

To collaborate with the National System of Public Security for the
fulfillment of its objectives; and

To verify the compliance with this law, and if applicable, to penalize
infractions of the same.'

In regard to the operation of the Registry, the Act provided for the creation of a “Renave
Advisory Committee”, to be made up of various government offices and automotive
industry associations, for the purpose of advising on issues relative to the integration,

organization and operation of the Registry.

The Act set out in detail the terms and functioning of the Registry itself. Among other
requirements, the Registry was to operate as a public service under the responsibility of
the Secretariat and was to maintain a database of information on each vehicle to be
provided by the authorities, manufacturers, assemblers, dealers, insurers, private parties
or any other source.” Furthermore, the database was to remain the exclusive property of

the Secretariat.

The Registry was to contain specific information about each vehicle registered in the
database, including: (i) the vehicle’s identification number, (ii) the vehicle’s essential
characteristics; (iii) the name and domicile of the vehicle’s owner; (iv) notices updating

this information; and (v) any other information established in the regulations.’

Information related to theft and recovery of vehicles was to be provided by the National
System of Public Security pursuant to Article 8 through co-ordination agreements

established for this purpose.

In the Tribunal’s view, it is manifestly self-evident that much of the information to be
recorded in the Registry’s database would be confidential and would be so regarded

both by vehicle-owners particularly and by the public generally.

The Act also prescribed conditions for concessions operating the Registry, including
mandatory terms to be included in an eventual ‘title of concession’ or concession

agreement with a concessionaire.

Article 16: Article 16 prescribed criteria that prospective concessionaires had to meet in

order to qualify to operate the Registry:

“Article 16. The Secretariat may grant one or more concessions for the
provision of the public service of the Register, to those who meet the
following requirements:

I Being a corporation with variable capital incorporated under
Mexican laws.

I. Having a corporate capital without right to withdraw and paid in
full, and that cannot be less than that set by the Secretariat, and

Ii. Demonstrate its technical, administrative and financial capacity.

Foreign investment may participate up to no more than 49% of the
concessionaire’s capital stock. A favourable resolution from the National
Commission of Foreign Investment is required for foreign investors to
participate in a higher percentage.”

Accordingly, the concessionaire had to be a Mexican entity; and if there were to be any

foreign interest, the foreign investor would have to invest in that Mexican entity.

Article 17: Concessions were to be granted for a period up to ten years, after which the
concession could be extended “at the Secretariat’s discretion” for an additional
maximum period of ten years, “provided that the concessionaire has complied with the

conditions foreseen in the concession and requests it not later than three years before its

Part IV — Page 6

4-30

conclusion”. Accordingly, the maximum term for a concession was to be twenty years;

but it could be ten years or less.

Articles 21, 22 & 24: The grounds for termination and revocation of the concession
were set forth in Articles 21 and 22, respectively. Amongst the grounds identified in
Article 21 for termination was revocation. Article 24 provided for indemnification in

cases where termination was due to reasons of public utility or interest.

Article 25: The Secretariat also had the power, pursuant to Article 25 of the Act to

“requisition” the Registry on national security grounds. Article 25 provided as follows:

“Article 25. In case of any imminent peril for the national security, the
country’s peace or the national economy, the Secretariat may request the
operations centre and other facilities, immovable or movable goods and
equipment used for the Registry’s operation. The Secretariat shall be
equally entitled to use the staff working for the operating companies
whenever it deems it necessary. The requisition shall last as long as the
conditions that prompted it subsist.”
Article 26: Finally, the Act established infringing conduct under the Act and correlative
sanctions for those infringements. Amongst conduct proscribed in Article 26 was the
concessionaire’s “failure to comply with any of its obligations”. An infringement of
Article 26 gave rise to incremental monetary sanctions ranging from a fine of 500
“minimum wages” for minor infractions to 30,000 minimum wages for more serious

infractions.

(03) The Concession Tender and Bidding

1999: In February 1999, the Secretariat published the bidding rules for the concession’s
tender. One month later, on 26 March 1999, a committee was created with a mandate of

ensuring the compliance of the tendering process with applicable regulations. Outside

4 “Minimum wages” are defined in Article 27 of the Act as the daily general minimum wage in force in the Federal
District at the time the infringement took place.

Part IV — Page 7

4-31

4-32

consultants were engaged to conduct the tender within the framework established by the
Secretariat. This framework was comprised of three elements: (1) design, control and
oversight by the Federal Government; (2) private operation of the Registry; and (3)

active involvement of State administrations.

The Secretariat instructed consultants, Casa de Bolsa Bancomer, S.A. de C.V. (“CBB”),
GEO Grupo de Economistas y Asociados, S.C. (“GEA”), Tecnofin, S.A. de C.V.
(“Tecnofin’) and Creel, Garcia Cuellar y Muggenburg, S.C. (“Creel”) (collectively, the
“Consultants”) to prepare an informational overview of the project for entities interested
in participating in the concession’s tender. This overview described the Registry’s
general purpose as providing an information source that would enable Mexican citizens
to know the legal status and ownership of vehicles circulating in the country’s territory

from the point of manufacture (or importation) to their final removal from circulation.

In order to achieve this purpose, the Registry was to have the following characteristics:

 

Completeness That includes all the possible sources of
creation, destruction and modification of the
legal status of vehicles

Binding nature That assures the maximum coverage and
usefulness of the information

National coverage | That attains the necessary centralization of
the information to meet national problems
That improves the safety of the register by
controlling only one database

Public access That provides information to the agents
participating in the automobile markets —
including individuals -— financial and
insurance agents, to promote its better
operation

Automated That shall be designed taking advantage of
the available equipment and communication
technology, which shall allow to rely on
updated information

On 29 March 1999, the Secretariat published an invitation to tender. One of the bidders
was a Consortium comprising Talsud, Gemplus, and Mr Henry Davis Signoret. In
accordance with Article 16 of the Act, the concessionaire was to be a Mexican legal
entity, with its ownership split as to 51% for the Henry Davis Group, as to 29% for
Talsud and 20% for Gemplus.

On 3 May 1999, the Consortium presented a formal request for registration as a bidder.
There were 91 bidders for the project; and 45 of those bidders, from 24 consortia, were
registered as bidders by 21 May 1999. It was clearly a project which was attractive to

private investors both within and without Mexico.

On 21 May 1999, the Secretariat issued a prospectus which anticipated the registration
of both used vehicles and new vehicles, but which recognized that used vehicles would
constitute the vast bulk of the registrations within the new Registry. The registration of
new vehicles would be relatively straightforward because it would be made mainly
through car dealerships at the point of sale when the car was purchased in Mexico. It
was known that the registration of used vehicles raised more complex issues; and it was
appreciated that, at least initially, the registration of used vehicles would be less
profitable or even loss-making, requiring it to be subsidized by the registration of new
vehicles (which would be more profitable). Over time, however, it was expected that the
registration of used vehicles would become profitable. It was always envisaged that
both used and new vehicles would be registered; and there was no intent or plan to

register only used or only new vehicles.

On 30 July 1999, the Consortium and five other bidders were permitted to file their bids

with the Secretariat.

On 6 August 1999, the Consortium demonstrated its proposed system; and on 20 August
1999, the Secretariat opened the economic proposals submitted by the remaining

bidders.

Part IV — Page 9

4-38

4-39

4-41

On 27 August 1999, the Secretariat awarded the Concession to the Consortium; and on
15 September 1999, the Secretariat and the Concessionaire concluded the Concession

Agreement (to which the Tribunal returns in more detail below).

The Claimants, at a late stage of these arbitration proceedings, appeared to criticise this
bidding procedure, adopting allegations made by others elsewhere that the award of the
concession to the Consortium had been influenced by corruption. In the cross-
examination of Dr Blanco, Leading Counsel for the Claimants questioned, in particular,
whether certain transparency measures taken during the bidding process, such as the
video-taping of meetings, were the result of concerns that there might later be

allegations of irregularities [D5.993].

This was perhaps a surprising line of attack on the Respondent’s case and on Dr Blanco
as a witness, given that the Claimants were the successful bidder. In the Tribunal’s
view, there was nothing of any substance in this forensic exercise; and it can be ignored

as completely ill-founded on the evidence adduced in these proceedings.

(04) |The Consortium and Incorporation of the Concessionaire

The Consortium incorporated a Mexican legal person which was to become the
Concessionaire on 6 September 1999, controlled by three groups of shareholders: Mr
Henry Davis Signoret, Talsud and Gemplus. Each group was selected to contribute to
the Consortium: Gemplus was a leading manufacturer of smart cards worldwide and
would supply the vehicle registration cards; Talsud contributed its technical experience
as having operated vehicle registries in Central and South America (including Sertracen
in El Salvador); and Mr Henry Davis was chosen by the other two investors as a result

of his reputation as a successful businessman in Mexico.

Part IV — Page 10

4-44

The share capital in the Concessionaire was divided as follows:

Shareholder % Ownership Series
Gemplus Industrial 20% “Cc”
Talsud, S.A. 29% “B”
Henry Davis Signoret 51% “A”

(Mr Henry Davis subsequently transferred his shares to a Mexican company owned and
controlled by his family, Aplicaciones Informaticas S.A. de C.V., with the Secretariat’s

approval).

As already recited above, within a week of the Concessionaire’s formation, on 15
September 1999, the Secretariat and the Concessionaire executed their Concession
Agreement (the “Concession Agreement” or “Title of Concession”). Neither Mr Henry
Davis, nor Talsud nor the Gemplus Claimants were contracting parties to this

Concession Agreement.

(05) The Concession Agreement

The Concession Agreement set out twenty-one conditions applicable to the public
service of the Registry, including the applicable legal framework (fourth condition),
services to be provided (sixth condition), the level of service required (seventh
condition), security (ninth condition), the Concessionaire’s rights and obligations (tenth
condition) and the conditions for “termination, revocation and requisition” (seventeenth
condition). Among other documents, a copy of the Consortium’s Technical Bid and its
Economic Bid, along with a copy of its Business Plan, were annexed to the Concession
Agreement. The Concession Agreement envisaged the registration of both used and new
vehicles, like the Act; and it was never envisaged that the project would be limited to

new vehicles.

Part IV — Page 11

4-45 Sixth Condition: As already indicated, the sixth condition of the Concession Agreement
prescribed the services that were to be provided by the Concessionaire, including the

following:

the modification of its obligations established in this Title of
Concession, or in any other provision issued by the competent

or revoked by the Secretariat:

“The Concession shall terminate, be revoked by the Secretariat or be

subject to requisition by it, pursuant to the terms and conditions
established in the Law.

Secretariat of the Treasury and Public Credit for the prompt refund of the
payment made by the Concessionaire, providing that the term does not
exceed sixty (60) calendar days following the acknowledgement of said
event or cause by the Secretariat with the understanding, however, that
there will be no reimbursement of the expenses incurred by the Secretariat
by reason of the grant of the concession the subject-matter thereof.

In case the Registry cannot operate at the level of certain states or
municipalities for reasons not attributable to the Concessionaire, the
latter shall be freed from its responsibilities in connection with said state
or municipality, and therefore, from paying any conventional penalty to
the Secretariat.”

4-48 Nineteenth Condition: The Nineteenth Condition, mirroring Article 17 of the Act (see

above) prescribed the period of the Concession:

“Pursuant to the provisions of Article 17 of the Act this Concession shall
be in force for a term of ten (10) years, to be counted as of the date of
signature of the document. The Concession may be prorogated at the
Secretariat's discretion, up to for a term equal to the one originally
established, provided that the Concessionaire has complied with the
conditions foreseen in the Concession and requests it not later than three
(3) years before its conclusion.”

The “date of signature” was 15 September 1999; and accordingly the Concession was to
expire on 14 September 2009 or, if all the specified conditions were met as to
compliance, notice and the exercise of the Secretariat’s discretion, up to 14 September

2019.

4-49 Twenty-First Condition: The Concession Agreement contained an express jurisdiction
agreement, as follows:

(06) The Operation of the Registry

1999: On 18 November 1999, the Secretariat appointed Analitica Consultores
Asociados S.C. (“Analitica”), a Mexican consultancy, to supervise the Registry’s pre-
operative stage and to advise the Secretariat whether and to what extent the
Concessionaire was complying with its obligations under the Concession Agreement. (It

was removed from this role by the Secretariat in early 2001).

2000: The pilot phase for the operation of the Registry began on 15 February 2000 with
the registration of new and used vehicles in the states of Hidalgo and San Luis Potosi.
71 document processing centers (“CTDs”) were created in Hidalgo and 82 CTDs were
created in San Luis Potosi. Over the period from 15 February 2000 to 31 May 2000,
about 40,000 registration applications were submitted, approximately 6,000 of which

related to new vehicles and about 34,000 relating to used vehicles.

On 28 April 2000, the Secretariat published in the Official Bulletin the schedule of
obligations arising under the Act, in respect both of the pilot phase in the states of
Hidalgo and San Luis Potosi and of the national phase for new vehicles. It was indicated
that a schedule of obligations for the registration of all used vehicles in the national

phase would follow within two months (i.e. June 2000).

On 8 June 2000, as indicated, the Secretariat published in its Official Bulletin the
schedule for owners of all used vehicles to register their vehicles with the
Concessionaire. The schedule imposed a deadline of 15 December 2000. This schedule
further established other dates for various transactions, including the filing of notice of

change in regard to a vehicle, i.e. change of vehicle information, plates, retirement, etc.

On 30 June 2000, an “Agreement” concerning the ceiling prices that could be charged
for all notices and services provided to users of the Registry was published in the

Official Bulletin, establishing the following maximum fees (amongst others):

Service Maximum fee (MXN $P)

 

Registration of First Hand Sales $375

 

Registration of Second Hand Sales $100

Information

 

 

 

 

Although 100% of the fee charged for the registration of new vehicles was remitted to
the Concessionaire, the Concessionaire retained only 25 pesos of the maximum 100
pesos for the registration of used vehicles in order to permit competition among CTDs

on the basis of commission, which could range from no commission to 75 pesos.

(07) Registration of New Vehicles

The registration of new vehicles nation-wide began on 2 May 2000.

The “White Book”, published later by the Secretariat on 25 October 2000 in accordance
with the National Development Plan, reported that as of that date “the infrastructure
hired by Concesionaria RENAVE, S.A. de C.V. to operate the service exceeds the
requirements to process the number of new vehicle transactions and to serve the
vehicles that have been already registered.” According to this same source, over

250,000 new vehicles had by then been registered by the Concessionaire.

At this point, in regard to new vehicles, there was no material criticism of the
Concessionaire’s conduct by reference to its obligations under the Concession
Agreement, still less any criticism of the Consortium, neither by the Secretariat or its

technical adviser, Analitica.

Part IV — Page 18

4-59

4-61

(08) The Registration of Used Vehicles

The registration of used vehicles began nation-wide on 15 June 2000.

As explained in more detail below, the registration of used vehicles proved to be highly
unpopular for several reasons. As a result, the number of registrations of used vehicles
dropped precipitously after 21 August 2000 (following the Secretariat’s suspension of
the legal obligation to register used vehicles by 15 December 2000) and still further
after 24 August 2000 (following news reports concerning the alleged criminal past of
the Concessionaire’s General Director, Mr Cavallo and his arrest in Mexico).
Accordingly, in contrast with the number of new vehicles registered by October 2000
(not being equally susceptible to public opinion), less than 200,000 used vehicles had

been registered by that same date.

In addition, there was a change of political administration at the level of the Presidency
and the Federal Government. On 2 July 2000, Mr Vicente Fox Quesada (PAN) was
elected to be the new President of Mexico; and under these same national elections the
PRI lost power at the level of the Federal Government. The new political
administration assumed power on 1 December 2000. It was perhaps inevitable that there
would be at least a change of emphasis in regard to the Registry under the new PAN
Federal Government (given the Registry’s statutory PRI origin); and, moreover, PRI
state politicians who previously had to support the PRI’s initiative could now oppose it,
particularly within the Federal District. (It was always and remained essential for the
Secretariat to secure co-ordination agreements for the Registry with all states and other
relevant state entities: see the Concession Agreement’s Seventeenth Condition, cited at

Paragraph 4-47 above).

Part IV — Page 19

4-62

(09)

Before these events, by the beginning of July 2000, Mr Henry Davis Signoret (as
chairman of the Concessionaire’s Board of Directors) expressed reservations over the
Concessionaire’s performance of the Concession at meetings of its Board. The minutes

of the Board meeting on 2 July 2000 reflect the following financial and technical

The Management of the Concessionaire

concerns during this period:

“FIRST ITEM: In relation to the first item of the Agenda, the Chairman
informed those present that to this date, the Company has been financing
itself solely on the basis of cash flow, and as a consequence, the Company
has stopped paying some of its suppliers because the actual cash flow is
not sufficient given the level of the Company’s costs.

Consequently, the Chairman stated that it was necessary to increase the
capital of the Company and proposed the Board of Directors to present to
the shareholders of the Company a request to increase the capital of the
Company in the amount of P$10,000,000 (Ten Million Pesos National
Currency). After an extensive discussion of this matter, the Chairman
requested those present to take a resolution in this respect.

RESOLUTIONS

J. It was approved by unanimous decision of those present that the
shareholders be presented with a request to increase the capital to the
Company in the amount of P$10,000,000 (Ten Million Pesos National
Currency).

2. It was approved that if necessary, once the contribution of capital
referred to above had been made, Banco Invex, S.A. will be requested to
provide an additional amount of P$10,000,000 (Ten Million Pesos
National Currency) under the line of credit contracted with said financial
institution.

SECOND ITEM: In relation to the second item on the Agenda, the
Chairman informed those present that to date, the Board had not received
information pertinent to the technical processes and the structure of the
systems of the Company having doubts over its functioning, and
consequently, he proposed that a technical audit be conducted by a
company with recognized prestige, which shall review and evaluate the
technical processes, the structure of the systems database, and any
questions in relation to informatics, systems, administration and the
technical areas of the Company.

Part IV — Page 20

4-63

4-64

[]
RESOLUTION
‘I. The conduct of a technical audit of the Company is approved.

2. The company that will conduct said audit will be designated in the next
few days by Mr Henry Davis Signoret, Chairman of the Board of
Directors.”

By the end of July 2000, the Chairman’s criticisms had led to personal differences with
Mr Taiariol of Talsud in respect of the management of the Concessionaire. Mr Taiariol
was persuaded to resign as a director; and a resolution was passed at the Board meeting
held on 25 July 2000 to accept Mr Tafariol’s resignation as Commercial Director in

these terms:

“SIXTH ITEM: In discussion of the Sixth Item of the Agenda, the
Chairman [Mr Henry Davis Signoret] commented to those present that the
presence of Mr Victor Taiariol as Commercial Director of the Company
was not entirely favourable for either the internal or external image of the
Company, and it made the accountability and the evaluation of his
performance more difficult, since Mr Taiariol is also a Principal Member
of the Board of Directors. To this, Mr Taiariol tendered his resignation as
Commercial Director of the Company. The Chairman requested those
present to evaluate Messrs. Domenico Suave or Slim Masmoudi as
possible candidates to hold the position of Commercial Director of the
Company. The Chairman asked those present if they wish to make a
decision in that respect, and after ample discussion, the following was
unanimously agreed:

RESOLUTION

‘I. The resignation of Mr Victor Taiariol from the position of Commercial
Director of the Company is accepted with effect as of today, thanking him
for his efforts during the time that he held this position. y!

 

Two weeks later, at the Board meeting on 8 August 2000, Mr Bilbao presented several
matters of concern with regard to the Concessionaire’s finances and operations,

recorded in the minutes of this meeting as follows:

“2. Mr Guillermo Bilbao made a presentation on the financial, administrative
and human resources situation of the Company. The most relevant points
were the following:

Part IV — Page 21

4-65

. There is an important delay in the preparation of the Financial
Statements and consequently it is not possible to reconcile,
completely, the income of the Company vs. the operations.

. There are some claims for delays in payments to the CTDs
[Document Processing Centers]. It was agreed to develop an easy
process to notify the CTDs of the receipt of the corresponding
invoices so that both parties are aware of the date in which the 15
day period to effect payment begins to run.

. The total revenues of the Company to date are 67.4 Million Pesos.

. It is necessary to identify which operations correspond to used
automobiles and which correspond to new autos because that
affects the “floating” of the Company.

. As regards to the loan with INVEX, it was proposed to GE Capital
Bank to establish bridging accounts with the banks to concentrate
the revenue. In that respect, Banorte and Banamex have not
responded although the other banks have.

. The works for the security systems for the offices of the Company
are hoped to be finished in about 3 weeks.

[.]”
One week later, on 15 August 2000, another Board meeting was held in which public
opposition to the Concessionaire was discussed, including the filing of “amparos” or
constitutional court challenges to the Act and the Secretariat by Mexican citizens. The

minutes of the meeting include the following passages:

“I. Situation of the Line of Credit issued by Banco Invex, S.A. (“INVEX”)
to the Company.

The Chairman [Mr Davis] reported to those present on INVEX’s concerns
regarding the political situation which confronts the Company at the
present moment and consequently, its financial situation to face its
payment obligations in relation to the Line of Credit granted by INVEX.

II. Guarantees granted by the shareholders of the Company under
contracts with suppliers entered into by the Company.

Part IV — Page 22

The Chairman indicated that to date, there are inconsistencies in the
guarantees and/or guarantors granted by the shareholders of the
Company (the “Shareholders”) in favour of the same Company. In this
respect, the Chairman requested the General Director [Mr Ricardo
Cavallo] to prepare a list of the pending payment obligations for the
Company pointing out which are guaranteed by the Shareholders and in
what proportions, with the objective of evaluating the situation in detail
and reorganizing the issuance of the guarantees and/or guarantors by the
Shareholders in order for the three Shareholders to guarantee the total
amount of said obligations in the same proportions as their participation
in the shareholding capital of the Company.

At the same time, the Chairman stated that once the study of the pending
payment obligations of the Company has been completed, they should
contemplate the possibility of requesting the Shareholders to increase the
capital stock of the Company in order to be able to face said obligations.

VI. Legal situation of the Company in relation to the Concession for the
Operation of the Public Service of Operating the National Vehicle
Registry and the Contract signed with SECOFI: position of the Company
and defense of the Amparos brought against the Act and SECOFI.

8 Amparos have been brought, of which only in four cases does the
Company appear as an affected third party. A firm of lawyers has been
retained to oversee the cases against the Company, SECOFI and the law
[the Act].

VII. Plans and measure for modifying the political opposition to the
project.

. The General Director [Mr Cavallo] will be requested to
request the Public Relations area to make a presentation to
the Board.

. Each Director of each area shall make a presentation of 10

minutes to the Board in each Session, starting with the next
Meeting of the Board. The General Director was requested
to inform the directors in this respect.

. The General Director and Mr Bertrand Moussel will

coordinate to inform the Board on the possibility of using a
simpler smart card.

. A meeting was held with Advantage on the past 14 August
2000, at which it was agreed that Advantage would begin
production to reach SMM overlays by the end of the year.
However, it was warned that it would be informed of the
project's status by 15 September 2000 as to the situation of
the project and the decision to continue or not with the
production of the overlays.”
This was nonetheless the relative calm before the storm unleashed within the next few
days, with allegations of grave criminality against Mr Cavallo and his arrest at Cancun
on 24 August 2000 amidst a blaze of publicity adverse to the Concession and the

Concessionaire (The Tribunal returns to these events in detail below).

Following Mr Cavallo’s detention in prison in Mexico City, Mr Bilbao was appointed
General Director of the Concessionaire (back-dated to 23 August 2000). This
appointment was notified by letter to the Secretariat on 24 August 2000 and ratified at

the next Board meeting, held on 20 September 2000.

The minutes of that Board meeting summarise the adverse events then affecting the

Concessionaire, as of 20 September 2000:

“TI. Legal Actions

It was agreed by the Board that, with the opinion and assistance of the
Legal Direction of the Company and the external lawyers, the possibility
of bringing legal actions against SECOFI and/or before the competent
tribunals will be evaluated in order to protect the interests of the Company
and the patrimony of its shareholders.

LJ

VII. Obligations under the Title Concession [the Concession Agreement]:

. It was evident that in accordance with the decrees published in the
Official Gazette of the Federation on 29 August 2000 and 13

September 2000, SECOFI ordered a technical intervention and
subsequently an administrative intervention into the company.

Part IV — Page 24

. Those present recognized that as long as the Concession is not
revoked in strict compliance with the applicable legal provisions,
the Company, inasmuch as is possible and insofar as the
intervention allows, will continue to comply with its obligations
under the Title of Concession.”

(The Tribunal describes these Technical and Administrative Interventions below).

Following his appointment as General Director, Mr Bilbao engaged the accountants,
Deloitte & Touche, to conduct an audit of the performance of the Concessionaire’s
“General Directorate” up to 25 August 2000. The results of this audit were discussed at
the Board meeting held on 11 December 2000. The minutes of this meeting record the

following discussion:

“Based on the audit ordered by the Board as requested by the General
Director appointed after 25 August 2000 [Mr Bilbao], which was
conducted by the accounting firm of Deloitte Touche, which was discussed
in this meeting, it was determined that in said administration there were
important deficiencies in the execution and control of different aspects
that affected the adequate and efficient operation of the company. In
particular the lack of order and administrative controls and certain
irregularities in the exercise of the powers of certain officers with
responsibility for the management of the company were underscored. It
was pointed out that the General Director [Mr Carvallo] did not timely
and adequately present the information regarding the Company's
business, the financial situation of the same, nor the problems and
deficiencies derived from the contracts with the principal suppliers of
goods and services to the Company. It was also mentioned that, under that
administration, the administrative, accounting and information systems,
necessary for the adequate functioning of the Company, were not
implemented, and that the General Director omitted to inform the Board
of the problems that were faced in their implementation.”

The Board therefore resolved at this meeting that the “activities of the Company shall be
focused on correcting the problems faced by the operation of the same in order for it to
have a working registry that will allow the provision of an adequate service to the

consumers.”

In the Tribunal’s view, these internal problems within the Concessionaire’s
management were not trivial; but equally, they were not seriously imperilling the

Concessionaire as a future long-term business concern, as at 24 August 2000.

(10) Political Opposition to the C ionaire and the C

By mid-August 2000, as already noted, the Concessionaire faced growing political
difficulties within Mexico. In particular, the public objections to the Concession made it
difficult for the Federal Government to secure the necessary “co-ordination agreements”
with other entities, which would allow the Concessionaire access to vehicular

information collected and maintained by state and federal agencies.

Complaints concerning the cost of registering used vehicles and, in particular, confusion
caused by the discrepancy in the commissions charged by CTDs for this service, also
fuelled public criticism of the Registry. The Government of the Federal District of
Mexico voiced strong opposition to the Registry and in particular its operation by a

private concessionaire.

It is necessary to examine these several related difficulties in turn.

(11) The Negotiation of Co-ordination Agreements

During the period running up to and following the national elections on 2 July 2000, the
negotiation of co-ordination agreements with state and federal entities became
increasingly difficult. In addition, technical difficulties arose because (for example) the
Secretary of Security had been unable to provide relevant data relating to certain stolen

vehicles to the Registry.

Article 3 of the Act had provided the Secretariat with the power to “enter into co-

ordination agreements with the state and Federal District governments, in order to

Part IV — Page 26

4-77

4-78

4-79

4-80

facilitate the Registry’s coverage, try to achieve its proper functioning and effect the

exchange of information”.

The Secretariat’s initial strategy had been to negotiate and enter into agreements
concurrently with the start-up of the Registry’s operations. The Secretariat’s Under-
Secretary (Dr Ramos Tercero) and the Concessionaire’s General Director (Mr Cavallo)
with others involved in the project had travelled extensively throughout Mexico in an
effort to meet with State officials and to negotiate and conclude co-ordination

agreements.

Six coordination agreements were signed with the states of Baja California, Baja
California Sur, Colima, México, Nuevo Leon and Sonora between April and August
2000. By mid-August 2000, meetings had taken place with officials from 14 other

States with varying degrees of progress. The exercise remained far from complete.

(12) The 2 July 2000 Federal Elections

In June and early July 2000, political opposition to the Concessionaire and the
Secretariat began to grow, particularly during the final weeks of the national elections.
The candidate for the PRI party (the party of the incumbent President) was challenged
by Mr Fox Quesada of the PAN. On 2 July 2000, Mr Fox was elected as the next
President, breaking seventy or more years of PRI incumbency at the level of the Federal

Government.

On 1 December 2000, the new PAN administration took office as the new Federal
Government. President Fox appointed Mr Luis Ernesto Derbez Bautista as Secretary of
the Economy (formerly SECOFI), thereby replacing Dr Herminio Blanco. These

political changes were to have significant effects for the Concessionaire.

(13) Public Perceptions of the Cost of Registering a Vehicle

The cost of registering new and used vehicles had also become increasingly

controversial during the summer of 2000.

As already described, the original fee schedule for the registration of used vehicles was
designed to permit competition between CTDs in regard to commissions charged for
registering used vehicles. The fees for used vehicles were, however, considered
confusing by vehicle-owners; and the project became highly unpopular and perceived as
a new tax on existing car-ownership, notwithstanding the large-scale publicity campaign
the Concessionaire had undertaken to explain the purpose of registration and the basis

for the fees charged.

14.07.2000: On 14 July 2000, Mr Henry Davis Signoret (as the Concessionaire’s
Chairman) wrote to Dr Ramos (at the Secretariat) concerning public protests over the
cost of registering vehicles. In his letter, Mr Davis proposed that the maximum price
that should be charged by CTDs be defined and published by the Secretariat to quell

public confusion, as follows:

“Pursuant to our discussion during our last meeting and pursuant to
Condition Fifth of the Title of Concession of the public service of
operating the National Vehicle Registry, I submit to the Secretariat's
consideration the advisability of defining the maximum price that the
Document Processing Centers [CTDs] will be able to charge for the
procedures contemplated in the Agreement published in the Official
Gazette on 20 June 2000.

The foregoing, in view of the unfavourable comments caused by said fees
and protests by the users and the media who believe that a charge in
excess of 300% of the maximum fee charged by the Operator of the
Registry is unjustified.

In addition and notwithstanding the publicity campaign that has been

effected, there is a lot of confusion at a national level among the users of
the National Vehicle Registry due to the diversity in said commissions.

Part IV — Page 28

4-84

4-85

4-86

4-87

It should be noted that this measure may generate dissatisfaction among

the Document Processing Centers, and hence, a reduction in the coverage,

as well as claims for compensation by users who have already paid the

current fee.”
20.08.2000: On 20 August 2000, a press article published in the national newspaper
Reforma reported President-elect Fox as saying during a radio interview that although
the National Vehicle Registry was an efficient mechanism to fight auto theft and
organized crime, it was debatable “who should pay for it”. Whether so intended or not
at the time, this qualified support was understood as questioning whether it was
appropriate to place the Registry in the hands of a private concessionaire working for

profit and not a national state agency.

21.08.2000: On 21 August 2000, the Secretariat announced a reduction in the maximum
cost of registering used vehicles from 100 to 50 pesos. Owners of used vehicles who
had already paid the registration charge were eligible for reimbursement at the CTD
where the vehicle had been registered, up to 50% of the amount paid. The cost of
registering new vehicles remained fixed at 375 pesos. (In addition, as already noted, the
Secretariat postponed the deadline for registering used cars from 15 December 2000 to

1 July 2001, to which we return separately below).

The reduction in the registration fee for used vehicles meant, however, that CTDs could
only charge a maximum commission of 25 pesos for the service, instead of 75 pesos.
This led to a diminished number of CTDs available for the processing of used vehicle
registrations. This in turn led to a reduction in the registration of used vehicles (caused

also by the postponed deadline).

The Claimants complain in these proceedings that the Secretariat made its decisions
“unilaterally” and caught the Concessionaire “completely unaware” [D1.44]. The
Tribunal rejects this complaint. It is clear from Mr Davis’ letter that something had to be
done and done quickly to calm growing public concerns; that the Concessionaire wanted
something done, particularly as regards fees for registering used cars; that the
Concessionaire was in communication with the Secretariat to have something done; and

that all this could only be done by the Secretariat as the responsible agency of the

Part IV — Page 29

Federal Government, not the Concessionaire itself. (The Tribunal returns to other

criticisms below).

(14) Specific Opposition within the Federal District

The Government of the Federal District of Mexico, under the leadership of Mayor

Rosario Robles was one of the most vocal public opponents of the Concession.

24.08.2000: On 24 August 2000, Mayor Robles wrote to Secretary Blanco (at the
Secretariat) regarding the impact of news reports released on that day alleging the

association of Mr Cavallo, the Concessionaire’s General Director, with a criminal past:

“The information published by the media in respect of Mr Ricardo Miguel
Cavallo, Director of the National Vehicle Registry, has increased the
concerns and preoccupations that I previously conveyed to you with
respect to the legal uncertainty that can be generated for the citizens by
leaving the operation of the Registry in the hands of a private party.

As you already know, the Permanent Commission of Congress approved
on the 29" [July], an agreement by which it proposed to revise the law to
eliminate the fee for registration at the National Vehicle Registry and
eliminate the possibility of tendering it to private parties.

For that reason, I respectfully request that all the necessary measures are
taken to suspend application of the Registry in the Federal District and to
reimburse the citizens that have already registered, the total amount paid
for this concept as a provisional measure, while we await a decision by
Congress.”
On the materials adduced in these proceedings, it can be reasonably assumed that the
media in Mexico City had received information on Mr Cavallo from sources close to
Mayor Robles: the timing of her letter and the media reports was therefore no

coincidence.

Moreover, in an interview on the Cavallo incident recorded in May 2005, Mr Ricardo

Pascoe (a former member of Mayor Robles’ cabinet) indicated that the Government of

Part IV — Page 30

the Federal District was aware of the allegations against Mr Cavallo prior to their
publication in Reforma, but that it elected not to raise the issue with the Secretariat in

order that it should be communicated to the public by the Mexican press:

“Well, my contact with the Cavallo case came about through a long-time

friend, who gave me his observation about Cavallo and sent me
information about the background of this individual, who to us, at the
time, was totally unknown because he appeared on the Mexican scene as a
concessionaire who won a call for him to manage a National System for
Vehicle Registration.

This, even though it is not the main topic, is for us Mexicans an important
one because, at that time, a serious discussion between the Government of
the National [Federal] District and the Federal Government precisely
about the establishment of the vehicle registration system was occurring.
And precisely what drew attention to its connection with Cavallo, it has to
be said, is that, Cavallo, being Argentine and apparently owner of a
concessionaire company, it had been brought to our attention that he had
a criminal background and also a background in political repression in
Argentina.

Immediately, this appeared very important to us. We received lots of
information about the case, such as Cavallo’s aliases and origin in terms
of military hierarchy. Additionally we learned about the businesses that he
had set up in the Republic of Argentina from his participation in the
repression. This, in Mexico immediately drew attention, well it drew my
attention.

I was in Mexico, the holder of this information and I immediately
discussed it with my boss at that time, [Mayor] Rosario Robles. We also
discussed it once during a cabinet meeting; I submitted the information
and introduced the topic. And for us, this had a double path: on the one
hand, we are talking about someone who apparently had participated in
the repression in Argentina, but on the other hand, we are also talking
about a person representing a project with which we were not in
agreement in Mexico, in terms of vehicle registration.

So, then, it was discussed and analyzed and I made the information
available to the head of government [of the Federal District], and well,
after a time of evaluating the information, we decided that we had to
handle the information not through the government, but through a
communication medium.”

This is politics, in Mexico as elsewhere. It was a political attack by the Mayor of the

Federal District on the Federal Government and on the Secretariat in particular. It was

Part IV — Page 31

4-91

4-92

4-93

hardly attractive as a form of good public administration. Yet by itself, the conduct of the
Federal District’s Government was not a breach by Mexico of international law or of the

two BITs here at issue. (The Tribunal considers its broader implications below).

(15) Postponement for Used Vehicles

21.08.2000: On 21 August 2000, as already noted, the Secretariat announced the
postponement of the deadline for the registration of used vehicles from 15 December

2000 to 1 July 2001.

The postponement was intended by the Secretariat to allow the Secretariat additional
time to conclude co-ordination agreements with the States and the Federal District, to
simplify the registration procedure in order to take advantage of existing local
infrastructure and the States’ collection of motor taxes and, more essentially, to take
some of the political heat out the situation caused by the deadline of 15 December 2000,
then only four months away. This was at the time a reasonable intention, reached in

good faith by the Secretariat.

(16) The Cavallo Incident

It is here necessary to relate at some length the relevant details of the so-called Cavallo
incident, including the criminal allegations against him, his arrest, his detention and his
eventual extraditions from Mexico to Spain and from Spain to Argentina. The Tribunal
re-states what is set out at the beginning of this Award: Mr Cavallo was not a named
party to these proceedings; he was not legally represented before this Tribunal; he was

not a witness in these proceedings; and this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate

Part IV — Page 32

4-94

4-95

4-96

upon any of the criminal allegations made against him. For all of these reasons, the
Tribunal does not here address the merits of any of the several criminal allegations
made against him. Moreover, whilst no-one is above the law; no-one is beneath it; and
in Mr Cavallo’s case (where he has still not been brought to trial and his defence rests
on mistaken identity), it is obvious that the legal presumption of innocence remains for

him of paramount importance, as it does for this Tribunal.

(17) Mr Cavallo’s Arrest, Detention and Extraditions

24.08.2000: On 24 August 2000, Reforma, a national Mexican newspaper, published an
article on its front page entitled "Director of Renave accused of being a criminal." Mr
Cavallo, as the General Director, was responsible for the Concessionaire’s day-to-day

operations; and he was, moreover, the public face of the Registry throughout Mexico.

The article alleged Mr Cavallo’s involvement in the international crimes of genocide,
terrorism, torture and murder as a military officer, as well as a personal pecuniary
involvement in document forgeries, auto thefts and property thefts, committed by the

Argentinean military dictatorship during the so-called “Dirty War” of 1976-1983.
The article read, in part, as follows:

“Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, director of the National Vehicle Registry in
Mexico, was identified yesterday [sic] in a photograph by five
Argentinean former political prisoners as the person who tortured them in
the Mechanics School of the Argentinean Navy (ESMA), during the
military dictatorship between 1976 and 1983.

The evidence also points to businessman Ricardo Miguel Cavallo as the
alleged former military man and Argentinean torturer then known as
Miguel Angel Cavallo now accused in Spain of auto theft, document
forgery, terrorism, and torture by Judge Baltazar Garzon.

Part IV — Page 33

4-97

4-98

4-99

4-100

Paradoxically, Cavallo is a director at Talsud, which together with the
companies Aplicaciones Informdticas, S.A. [Mr Davis’ company] and
Gemplus Industrial, S.A. incorporated Renave [the Concessionaire],
which was created by Mexican authorities to try to thwart auto theft and
document forgery.

Although the accused denies being the person accused, an investigation by
Grupo Reforma based on the testimony of former Argentinean political
prisoners, an identity study performed by an expert and confidential
information belie his statement ...”
Later on the same day, Mr Cavallo was detained by the Attorney General’s Office at
Cancun airport while attempting to leave Mexico for Argentina on a commercial flight,
on a holding charge related to a possible immigration offence. He was returned that

same day under guard to Mexico City, where he was held in custody.

25.08.00: On 25 August 2000, the Spanish judicial authorities, who had been
investigating crimes committed against Spanish nationals in Argentina, ordered the
Juzgado Central de Instruccién Nimero Cinco to request the provisional arrest for
extradition purposes of “Miguel Angel Cavallo” for alleged involvement in the crimes

of genocide, terrorism and torture committed during the Argentinean dictatorship.

That same day, the Attorney General’s Office in Mexico City received the request for
provisional arrest and extradition of “Miguel Angel Cavallo” from the Spanish
Government. The request was submitted to the Seventh District Court for Criminal
Matters in the Federal District of Mexico, which issued a provisional arrest warrant for
Mr Cavallo. Mr Cavallo was then placed in the formal custody of Interpol and held in

prison in Mexico City, awaiting extradition proceedings to Spain.

It will be noted that Mr Cavallo was detained in Cancun before the extradition request
was received by the Mexican authorities. It appears that an investigation by Interpol had
begun in Mexico before the article on Mr Cavallo’s past was published in Reforma, in
which both Spain and France were possibly involved. The evidence adduced in these
proceedings leaves it unclear precisely when, why or by whom such investigations were
instigated. The Respondent’s Counsel stated at the main hearing: “It is our

understanding that there were former Argentine nationals who had moved to Mexico as

Part IV — Page 34

4-101

4-102

4-103

4-104

a result of the Dirty War and that people saw Mr Cavallo through the media and
identified him as the alleged torturer ...” [D1.187]. However, it appears to the Tribunal
that no conclusive evidence of Mr Cavallo’s identity as “Miguel Angel Cavallo” had
been secured by the relevant Mexican authorities before the publication of the Reforma
article on 24 August 2000; and the article itself refers to identification by torture victims

only on the previous day (23 August 2000). There was evidently a difference in name.

It is unnecessary to recite here the details of the criminal allegations against Mr Cavallo.
They are very grave; and they relate, in the words of the Claimants’ Counsel, to “the
most serious international crimes in Argentina from the 1970s onwards” [D1.46]. It
suffices here to indicate that these allegations were not limited to widespread torture and
cold-blooded murder but included the forced dispossession of prisoners’ property and
systematic forgeries made to facilitate thefts of property, including vehicles. Whilst the
former constituted despicable international crimes, the latter appeared at the time to
strike directly at the secure workings of the Registry, particularly its confidential
database of vehicle registration numbers and vehicle owners’ names, addresses and
other personal details. In Mexico, it was considered that such confidential details in the
possession of organized criminals could greatly facilitate not only car-theft but also

kidnapping, extortion and murder.

11.01.2001: On 11 January 2001, a Mexican district judge authorized Mr Cavallo’s

extradition from Mexico to Spain.

28.06.2003: Following several unsuccessful appeals against his detention and order for
extradition before the Mexican courts, Mr Cavallo was extradited to Spain on 28 June
2003 to face prosecution for crimes of genocide and terrorism. He was then held in a
Spanish prison awaiting trial. It never took place. By diplomatic note of 5 June 2007,
Spain sought Mexico’s consent to the extradition of Mr Cavallo to Argentina from

Spain. This was granted by Mexico on 7 February 2008.

31.03.2008: Spain authorized his extradition to Argentina on 28 February 2008. The
criminal proceedings against Mr Cavallo in Spain were stayed on 14 March 2008 in

order to permit his extradition to Argentina. Although victims’ associations in Spain

Part IV — Page 35

4-105

4-106

4-107

4-108

appealed against this stay, the appeal was dismissed. Mr Cavallo was extradited to
Argentina on 31 March 2008, where he was arraigned and transferred to the Marcos Paz

prison in the province of Buenos Aires, to await trial.

Mr Cavallo continues to await trial in Argentina, in prison, for the criminal offences of
aggravated illegal deprivation of liberty, torture resulting in death, robbery, extortion,
“ideological forgery of public documents” (i.e. whereby a document looks authentic but
its content has been modified) and criminal association. One of these charges was filed
in 1999, three were filed in 2003, and one in 2004, all relate to alleged crimes

committed by military officers of the Escuela Mécanica de la Armada (ESMA).

If Mr Cavallo’s defence of mistaken identity prevails at trial, he will not be guilty of any
of the criminal charges against him; and he will have spent nine or more years in prison
as an innocent man. If guilty of these particular charges, it may be thought that no

sentence would be too harsh.

Mr Cavallo was scheduled to stand trial in Argentina in the autumn of 2009. As of the
date of this Award, it is not known to the Tribunal whether Mr Cavallo’s trial has taken

place.

(18) The Concession’s Shareholders and Mr Cavallo

Mr Cavallo was (and remains) a shareholder in Talsud, holding one third of the shares
in this company. He was a director of Talsud; and he was put forward as a candidate for
the general directorship of the Concessionaire by Talsud. His credentials, as listed in his
contemporary curriculum vitae, include training and professional experience at the
“Escuela Naval Militar” and the “Armada”, respectively, in Argentina. He made no
secret of his Argentinean background, his service as a naval officer and his name; and as

the Concessionaire’s general director he had frequently appeared in public, being

Part IV — Page 36

4-109

4-110

photographed and filmed by the Mexican media many times as the public face of the

Concessionaire.

Shortly following publication of the Reforma article on Mr Cavallo, Mexican
newspapers began to report on his association with Talsud and its directors, including

Mr Taiariol.

In an article published in Reforma on 30 August 2000, speculations were made

concerning Mr Tajariol’s sudden departure from Mexico following Mr Cavallo’s arrest:

“Renave partners desert Mexico

Representatives of the Argentinean company Talsud leave Cavallo behind.
Gemplus criticizes the absence and announces a lawsuit if irregularities
are confirmed.

The principal executives of the Argentinean company Talsud, one of the
three firms that were granted control of the National Vehicle Registry
(Renave), deserted Mexico and left Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, the partner
facing extradition, by himself.

The president of Talsud, Mr Taiariol, is in San Salvador. He said he went
there to “show his face” at the scandal caused by the Cavallo case with its
partners in that country.

[ou]

Ina telephone interview from El Salvador, Taiariol commented that he did
not leave Mexico to escape justice, but to be “where I am most needed”.

[ou]

“Due to this situation, the problems that initiated in Mexico, I am facing
consequences not only in El Salvador, but also in Argentina, and other
places where we directly or indirectly operate, and hence, at every
moment, I will have to be where I am most needed,” said Taiariol.

[.-]
“According to Taiariol, both Davis and executives from Gemplus, which is

a minority shareholder in the concessionaire, were notified of his trip to
Central America.

Part IV — Page 37

4-111

4-112

4-113

The Argentinean denied any support for Cavallo, who is responsible for
the scandal. “He will have to defend himself at a personal level,” he
insisted.

On the other hand, Gemplus, through its legal representative, Eduardo

Salgado, said it was disappointed and felt defrauded in its association with

Talsud.”
On the evidence adduced in these proceedings, this report was materially inaccurate as
regards the reasons for the absence from Mexico of Talsud’s representatives: Mr
Tafariol and Mr Siegrist. In fact, following the Cavallo incident, they returned to
Mexico City from El Salvador on 29 August and 7 September 2000 respectively. In any
event the situation was more complicated, as appeared from evidence adduced at a late
stage of these proceedings, whatever the public perception as at 30 August 2000 and,
more particularly, early September 2000. By the latter date, the death of Under-
Secretary Ramos Tercero had taken place. (The Tribunal addresses these evidential

materials separately below.)

On the evidence adduced in these proceedings, the Tribunal concludes that, if Mr
Cavallo were guilty of the crimes alleged against him, none of the Claimants (including
Talsud) had any actual knowledge of Mr Cavallo’s criminal past before August 2000.
The Respondent had checked the good standing of (inter alios) Mr Cavallo with the
Argentinean authorities during the bidding process and had received assurances that
there was nothing adverse recorded against him. The Respondent acknowledged (rightly
in the Tribunal’s view) that none of the Claimants could have discovered Mr Cavallo’s

alleged criminal past [D1.230 & D8.1680].

Accordingly, for the purpose of this Award, the Tribunal finds that none of the
Claimants or the Respondent knew or could have known or was otherwise at fault in not
discovering the criminal past alleged against Mr Cavallo before August 2000. If he were

an innocent man, it would of course have been quite impossible to do so.

(19) Preliminary Audits of the Concession’s Operations

Immediately following the publication of the accusations against Mr Cavallo on 24
August 2000, the Secretariat ordered an audit of the Concessionaire’s operations and the
data centers responsible for processing information, in order to ensure the security of the

Registry’s database.

24.08.2000: Dr Ramos Tercero (as the Under-Secretary) wrote to Mr Davis (for the
Concessionaire) informing him of the terms of an immediate “Verification Visit” on 24

August 2000:

“Pursuant to article 34 subsection XXX of the Federal Public
Administration Law; 16 subsections II and VIII, 50, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67,
68 and 69 of the Federal Administrative Proceedings Law; 3 subsection
VII of the Law of the National Vehicle Registry and ; 59 subsection II and
60 subsection II of its Regulations, a Verification Visit is issued under the
following terms:

Allow access to the National Vehicle Registry’s Computing Centre located
in the facilities of Hewlett Packard, located in Prolongacion Reforma
#700 in Lomas de Santa Fe, zip code 01210 in Mexico City...

The inspection will start at 19:00 hours on 24 August 2000 and will last as
long as it takes to complete these objectives...”

The Secretariat also requested that the Concessionaire deliver up all passwords and
access codes, cancel existing passwords, deliver all files provided to the Concessionaire

and delete any additional backup copies of this information.

In the Tribunal’s view, this was a responsible and measured response by the Secretariat
to the public concerns resulting from the allegations made against Mr Cavallo. It was
suggested by the Claimants that these amounted to unlawful ‘co-ordinated raids of
remarkable spontaneity and speed’, whilst apparently conceding that there was no
cogent evidence before the Tribunal to justify such an allegation [D1.48]. The Tribunal

rejects this criticism: the swiftness of the Secretariat’s response was the natural

Part IV — Page 39

4-118

4-119

consequence of public concerns over the Cavallo incident; and it was a reasonable and

necessary response in difficult circumstances.

The eventual outcome of these audits and inspection was reassuring to the Secretariat,
confirming that the confidentiality of information held by the Concessionaire had not
been breached from the Registry’s start-up onwards, such that no-one would have been
able to make improper use of the database's information. However, this did not suffice

to calm public concerns within Mexico.

(20) The Technical Intervention

29.08.2000: On 29 August 2000, facing continued pressure from public and political
opposition concerning the security of information collected and managed by the
Registry, the Secretariat issued a decree authorizing a ‘Technical Intervention’ in the

management of the Registry directed at the Concessionaire.

The purpose of such a Technical Intervention was set forth in the decree, reproduced

below:

“WHEREAS

That the operation of the National Vehicle Registry is a public service
whose purpose is the identification of vehicles manufactured, assembled,
imported or circulating in the national territory, as well as providing the
service of information to the public;

That this system of vehicle identification in all the country contributes to
the legal security of the legitimate owners of vehicles and discourages the
theft of the same;

That the current legal status of the former director of the concessionaire
referenced, due to the presumption of responsibility for illegal acts
imported to it, has generated uncertainty among the users of the service
and the public in general with respect to the confidentiality of the
information contained in the database that is necessary to provide the
service;

Part IV — Page 40

4-120

That this secretariat may use the [provision] in the second paragraph of
Article 25 of the Law of the National Vehicle Registry [cited earlier in this
Part IV of the Award, at Paragraph 4-28 above], to intervene in the
administration of the public service, in any circumstance which prevents
the concessionaire from intaining the optimal oy ion of the service,
and due to these circumstances, it is imperative and urgent to take
immediate measures, therefore I have decided to issue the following:

DECREE WHICH DECLARES THE INTERVENTION OF THE PUBLIC
SERVICE OF THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OF VEHICLES

ARTICLE 1.-The Federal Government, through the Secretariat of
Commerce and Industrial Development, declares the intervention of the
public service of operation of the National Vehicle Registry.

ARTICLE 2.-The Federal Government, through the Secretariat of
Commerce and Industrial Development, shall appoint a_ technical
intervener who shall exercise the powers necessary to guarantee the
integrity and confidentiality of the information contained in said registry.

ARTICLE 3.-Concesionaria RENAVE, S.A. de C.V. [the Concessionaire]
shall grant the intervener all powers necessary for the fulfillment of its
objectives, in accordance with all powers of Article 20, numeral X, of the
Law of the National Vehicle Registry.

ARTICLE 4.-The Secretariat shall decide when this intervention shall
cease, after the evaluation of the conditions which motivated it.”

Within the Secretariat, the individual officer responsible for this decree was the
Secretary, Dr Blanco, to whose testimony the Tribunal returns below. It is to be noted
that this decree was not based on any “imminent peril for the national security” under the

first part of Article 25 of the Act.

Mr Erasmo Marin Cérdova was promptly appointed by the Secretariat as the technical
intervener responsible for overseeing and supervising the Concessionaire's operations,
beginning his work immediately. Mr Marin was not called as a witness in these
proceedings; but his written reports were adduced in evidence. The Tribunal has found

them objective, professional and useful.

Part IV — Page 41

4-121 05.09.2000: Mr Marin issued his first report on the confidentiality aspects of the
Concessionaire on 5 September 2000. He reported the following observations to

Secretary Blanco:

. “[...] Currently, there is a place in the company Hewlett Packard where
the central computers and official databases of RENAVE function.
Additionally, there is an installation and equipment for disaster recovery
in the Concessionaire’s building, however, due to its function and to the
capacity of this equipment, the latter does not meet the need and
convenience of having a “mirror” installation which should be located
outside and far from HP.

Due to the increasing importance of this data base at the national level
and due to the circumstances such as that diverse private organizations
operationally intervene in the process of vehicle registration; it is
necessary and convenient to design and build a mirror centre in SECOFI.
The mirror centre should not be conceived as a non-operating centre, a
“dark room” with a terminal that monitors the network and periodical
controlled updates. The mirror centre of SECOFI should have terminals
that are connected with the workflow system that allows monitoring the
operation of each of the actors of the systems of the company and of the
databases that are not completely linked. In this way it could be publicly
confirmed that the database is secure with the redundancy and with the
controlled updating in the Public Sector premises.

. The company Keon of Mexico, as part of a network of companies that
make up the RENAVE system, has as a main duty to make the final review
of the documentation submitted by the individual that requests the
registration; likewise to capture the information of the owners and the
vehicles; verify them internally and “scan” the copies of documents
received in order to build a database that will permit the verification of
the precision of the content of a database of RENAVE.

. During the visit of 1 September [2000] it was observed that the system’s
operation of said organization was completely interrupted from 30"
[August,] supposedly by failures in the Informix database; simultaneously
due to that same failure and a failure in one of the two Scanners, the
scanning was also interrupted. To date the system is still not working and
since yesterday, the technical personnel continue to try to re-establish the
operation or obtain a backup to be operated at IBM.

The data obtained and the facts witnessed have led us to verify on one

side, the importance of this process for the company and on the other side,
the great vulnerability of the same. ...”

Part IV — Page 42

4-122 11.09.2000: On 11 September 2000, Mr Marin provided Secretary Blanco with a second

written report containing the following observations, amongst others:

“In order to confirm the assessments expressed to you and to Mr Raul
Ramos during our meeting on the 5 [September], and due to the first
review of the two main databases that provide the fundamental support for
the functioning of the RENAVE database; we have observed that in their
real actual operative conditions, they are unable to satisfy the needs of the
service offered to individuals and companies who own used vehicles.

[ou]

Given the conditions of the system’s operation and the situation of non-
conformity expressed in the media and in the Chamber of Deputies, it is
advisable to redefine the strategy to implant [sic] the system to continue
only with the registration of new vehicles and federal public transport,
during the time that is necessary in order to secure that the other data
bases can be in conditions to provide the updated, sufficient and
appropriate information to the service offered by RENAVE ...

Further to the letter submitted to you on the 5h of this month, the cause of
the failure in the computing equipment and the backup tapes that Keon
Mexico has in order to attend to RENAVE’s service, which occurred on
the 30" of last month, has not been identified or corrected. Therefore, its
operation has not been reestablished, as a result of which twelve days
have passed without the processing of any of the registration requests.

[ou]

Regarding our recommendation to establish in SECOFI, a “mirror
installation” in which the database of RENAVE users is updated
continuously; I inform you that the proposal by Hewlett Packard has been
submitted to Ing. Luis Young which contains two options which could
satisfy the needs that were raised. It is convenient for the General
Directorate of RENAVE in SECOFI to carefully analyze these or other
options in view of the actual circumstances, and to determine the best
solution for SECOFI to have the effective control of the public database of
Renave. Pursuant to article 5 of the Law, “The database remained
exclusive property of the Federal Government...”; measures suggested
could further guarantee the control and security of said database.”

4-123 During the period of this technical intervention, Mr Marin also engaged Grupo

Corporativo Informatico S.A. de C.V. (“GCI”) to undertake a technical evaluation of the

Part IV — Page 43

4-124

4-125

4-126

Concessionaire’s information security systems. The GCI report was issued in early

October 2000.

In the Tribunal’s view, the appointment of a ‘technical intervener’ under the Act was a
responsible and measured response by the Secretariat to the public concerns inevitably
resulting from the grave criminal allegations made against Mr Cavallo. Eventually, it
might have sufficed to assuage those concerns and restore public confidence in the
Concession, leading to the registration of both used and new vehicles as originally

planned, were it not for the events which soon followed.

(21) The Death of Under-Secretary Dr Ramos Tercero

07.09.2000: On 7 September 2000, Dr Ramos Tercero, who had been responsible for
running the project as Under-Secretary at the Secretariat (under Secretary Blanco) was
found dead in a wooded area to the west of Mexico City. His death was either a murder

or suicide. In either event, it was a very unexpected, sudden and brutal death.

Several personal documents were found after Dr Ramos’ death, including a letter
apparently written by him addressed to the General Director of Reforma. This letter, if
written by the deceased, confirms the difficult situation prevailing by early September
2000 in regard the Concessionaire following Mr Cavallo’s arrest. It reads, in relevant

part, as follows:

“... Tama clean man. I am an honest man. I have always been one. I have
never unduly benefited from office. My life is an open book in which there
is nothing to hide.

Part IV — Page 44

4-127

4-128

4-129

The bid for the concession of the National Vehicle Registry was carried
out fully consistent with the law and with complete transparency. The
audits that are about to be made undoubtedly will show that. I have no
doubts about that. Moreover, the operation of the Concessionaire has
been professional and clean and the operative difficulties that it faced can
be explained by the fact that the administrative unit under my charge has
been unable to provide certain necessary operation criterion rules in a
timely manner.

We did not do so because we were overwhelmed with work. For that
reason alone, there is no plot or conspiracy to make the National Vehicle
Registry an instrument to perform criminal acts, there never was, on the
contrary, we made a serious and professional effort to comply with our
duties despite the increasingly difficult conditions, created by the media,
which insisted on making us look like true criminals. ...”

 

It is impossible here to record in full, from the evidence, the devastating and immediate
effect of Dr Ramos’ death on the Secretariat, the Concessionaire and the Mexican public
at large. Dr Ramos was indeed well-known and respected in Mexico (and abroad) as an
honest man of great professional abilities, with a broad experience of government and
international affairs. Moreover, he was not known as a person who succumbed to
pressure or suffered from suicidal tendencies. He had shown no sign of distress at the
meeting earlier on 6 September 2000 with Dr Blanco and the Concessionaire’s

representatives.

Notwithstanding personal documents suggesting suicide, it was widely believed at the
time that Dr Ramos had been murdered by powerful criminal interests in Mexico and
that such criminals were thereby protecting their illegal activities connected to the
workings of the Registry, whether the Registry was thought to impede these activities
(being effective to combat organized crime) or conversely to facilitate them (being
susceptible to leaks of confidential information). Conversely, if his death were suicide,
questions arose as to the reason why Dr Ramos would take his own life if it were not a

reason somehow connected with the Registry and the Concessionaire.

Accordingly, the violent death of Under-Secretary Ramos Tercero, so soon after the
arrest of Mr Cavallo, greatly exacerbated public speculation and concerns over the

whole project for the National Vehicle Registry.

Part IV — Page 45

4-132

4-133

4-134

Following Dr Ramos’ death, Mr Luis Young Fonseca, Director General of the National

Vehicle Registry, assumed his position as Under-Secretary within the Secretariat.

(22) The Reaction of Talsud

23.08.2000: Talsud first learned of the criminal allegations against Mr Cavallo late on
23 August 2000, the day before the publication of the front-page article in Reforma. Mr
Cavallo had earlier been approached by a journalist from Reforma; and he in turn spoke
to Mr Taiariol. At that time, Mr Tafariol was in Mexico City; and Mr Siegrist had just
arrived on 22 August 2000 to attend board meetings of the Concessionaire on 23 and 24
August 2000. Mr Cavallo told them it was a case of mistaken identity and that he was
proposing to return to Buenos Aires to secure further proof of his identity. At this time,

the journalist’s inquiries did not seem to raise an immediate concern with Talsud.

24.08.2000: That changed the next morning. The publication of the article in Reforma,
Mr Cavallo’s arrest and the public reaction on 24 August 2000 posed a clear threat to
the future of the Concession and the Concessionaire, including Talsud as an
Argentinean company and Mr Cavallo’s original employer. Mr Miguel de Erice (then
Talsud’s lawyer in Mexico City) testified that he thought at the time that it was “the

death of Renave” leading to the cancellation of the Concession [D9.2128 & 2129].

On 24 August 2000, soon after the article’s publication, a meeting was held at the law
offices of Noriega & Escobedo in Mexico City, starting in the morning and continuing
into the afternoon. It was attended by Mr Siegrist, Mr Taiariol, Mr Juan José Borja
Papini and Mr de Erice (of Noriega y Escobedo). Mr de Erice had earlier acted as the
Concessionaire’s legal adviser but he was now advising Talsud. He left the afternoon
meeting to attend the Interpol office in Mexico City, awaiting Mr Cavallo’s return from

Cancun (under arrest) and instructing criminal lawyers to assist Mr Cavallo.

On 25 August 2000, after Mr Cavallo’s arrest and detention in prison, a meeting was

held between Mr Siegrist, Mr Taiariol, Mr Borja and Mr de Erice. On 26 August 2000

Part IV — Page 46

4-135

4-136

4-137

4-138

4-139

(Saturday), there was another meeting between Mr Tajfariol and Mr de Erice in Mexico
City. Mr Tafariol and Mr Siegrist then travelled by plane to El Salvador, as earlier
planned. On 28 and 29 August 2000, Mr de Erice met Mr Taiariol in El Salvador. On 29
August, Mr de Erice and Mr Tajariol travelled from El Salvador to Mexico City. On 7
September 2000, Mr Siegrist also returned to Mexico City, with Mr Borja.

06.09.2000: A meeting took place on 6 September 2000 between Mr Davis & Mr
Salgado for the Concessionaire and Dr Blanco & Dr Ramos at the offices of the
Secretariat, addressing the status of the Registry and the Concessionaire. (This meeting
was not attended by Mr Tafariol or Mr Siegrist). Later that night, Dr Ramos’ body was

found and his death announced on the radio and television.

07.09.2000: Mr Taiariol learned of Dr Ramos’ death on 7 September 2000. He was very
shocked and saddened. Mr Tajariol considered at the time that Dr Ramos was murdered
and did not commit suicide, as he still does today [D9.2030, 2031]. He also considered
that, if murdered, Dr Ramos’ death was somehow linked to the Registry; and that it was

therefore possible that more murders could take place [D9.2030].

Mr Siegrist testified that, on learning of Dr Ramos’ death on 7 September 2000, he “was
just totally overcome by circumstance. It was a person I knew, had dealt with, a person
that Mr Salgado told me: I was with him yesterday, and he was great, he was fine, and
then in the afternoon he takes his life?” [D9.2077] and “...They were very, very hard
circumstances” [D9.2079].

Mr de Erice testified that he was “very shocked and very, very worried” on learning of
Dr Ramos’ death [D9.2145]. His worries concerned the personal safety of those closely

involved with the Concessionaire, including Mr Tafariol and Mr Siegrist of Talsud.

08.09.2000: There were further meetings and other conversations between Mr Taiariol,
Mr Siegrist and Mr de Erice during the following days. Their timing and details are not
here relevant. Before returning to El Salvador on 8 September 2000, Mr Siegrist
testified that he “perceived panic in Dr de Erice” [D9.2073]. In his testimony, Mr

Siegrist used the phrase “mental and physical integrity” to describe the sensation of fear

Part IV — Page 47

4-140

4-141

4-142

felt by him at the time in Mexico [D9.2068]. Mr Siegrist decided that he would leave
Mexico City for El Salvador; that it was “crazy” for him to stay in Mexico [D9.2088 &
2090]; and that he would not be returning to Mexico until circumstances changed (he

returned only in February 2001). He so informed Mr Taiariol before his departure.

11.09.2000: Mr Taiariol met Mr de Erice during the morning of 11 September 2000,
during which there was also a telephone conversation between them. There was another
meeting between Mr Taiariol, Mr de Erice and a third person accompanying Mr de
Erice during the afternoon. Acting on their advice, Mr Taiariol decided to leave Mexico
on the next available flight to Argentina that same evening. Mr Tafariol left Mexico
City by plane late on 11 September 2000, arriving in Buenos Aires on the following
day. He was driven by car to the airport; but it is not clear whether he was accompanied

by Mr de Erice and/or the third person.

The Tribunal does not consider that the third person attending the afternoon meeting
was Mr Santiago Creel, as recalled by Mr Tajfariol. (Mr Creel was then active in
Mexican politics with PAN and close to President-elect Fox). The Tribunal accepts that
Mr Tajariol holds an honest belief otherwise; but the Tribunal considers that his belief is
probably mistaken. His present recollection is more than eight years old; he did not
know Mr Creel personally at the time; he therefore did not so recognize him at the
meeting (although he knew his name as a former law partner of Mr de Erice); and Mr
Tafariol’s recollection, whilst indirectly supported by Mr Siegrist, does not square with
other cogent evidence before this Tribunal, including the written and oral testimony of

Mr de Erice. (Mr Creel was not a witness in these proceedings).

It does not matter, for the purpose of this case, who this third person actually was. The
Tribunal accepts the honesty of Mr Taiariol’s testimony (albeit incorrect) as regards this
third person’s identity; his mis-recollection does not impeach him as an honest witness
or otherwise work to discredit him; and the Tribunal therefore rejects the submission
made by the Respondent that, having “lied” as a witness in regard to this third person’s
identity, an adverse inference should be drawn by the Tribunal against all of Mr

Tajariol’s testimony on all other issues in these proceedings. The Claimants made it

Part IV — Page 48

4-143

4-144

4-145

plain that their case did not depend in any way upon the identity of this third person;
and the Tribunal has placed no reliance on this third person’s identity for the purpose of
its decisions in this arbitration. However, this afternoon meeting is not wholly irrelevant

to certain other issues addressed by the Tribunal in this Award.

Whoever this third person was, it is clear that with Mr de Erice, the two men strongly
advised Mr Taiariol on 11 September 2000 that he should leave Mexico City urgently
for his personal safety. In the words of Mr Tafariol, “they told me that somehow they
had some information, and it was better for me to leave the country.” [D9.2020] and “if
Renave continued, there could be more death” [D9.2033]. Their advice was based on
the lack of security for Mr Tajariol as a person linked to Talsud, the Concessionaire and
the Registry; and it was consistent with the earlier impression received from Mr de

Erice by Mr Siegrist, as relayed to Mr Tajariol.

As was apparent from his testimony before the Tribunal, Mr Taiariol was not a person
to be easily frightened; and he described himself, in his own words, as “not an easy
person to deal with” [D9.2033]. Nor did Mr Siegrist give any different impression to the
Tribunal. Moreover, at about this time, Mr Cavallo’s companion and their young
daughter were instructed by Talsud to leave Mexico City and return to Argentina, also
on advice from Mr de Erice. This companion had worked as the Concessionaire’s
Comptroller; and her departure was arranged by Mr de Erice, as he confirmed during his
testimony [D9.2148]. In the Tribunal’s view, Mr de Erice conducted himself
professionally towards Talsud in these very difficult times; and his advice was both

sound and reasonable.

In the Tribunal’s view, the death of Dr Ramos had a far worse effect on the
Concessionaire than even the arrest and detention of Mr Cavallo, to which it was closely
linked in the minds of the public. As reports of Mr Cavallo’s extradition proceedings
continued in Mexico over the next 2 % years (until his extradition to Spain on 28 June
2003), that disturbing link was maintained in the public mind. Dr Ramos’ death and the
Cavallo incident were and remain important factors in this case. (The Tribunal considers

the legal significance of these factors later in this Award.)

Part IV — Page 49

(23) The Suspension of the Obligation to Register Used Vehicles

4-146 15.09.2000: One week after Dr Ramos’ death, on 15 September 2000, the Secretariat
published a decree indefinitely suspending the legal obligation of owners, suppliers, and

sellers to register used vehicles.
4-147 The preamble to this decree describes the purpose of the suspension as follows:

“WHEREAS

That the Law of the National Vehicle Registry establishes that the Registry
shall have a database, integrated with information about each vehicle
provided by the authorities, manufacturers, assemblers, commercial
entities, insurers, individuals or any other source;

That the Law of the National Vehicle Registry and its Regulation provide
that the obligation to register vehicles in circulation before the National
Vehicle Registry and the obligation to provide the notifications set out in
the said regulations shall be completed according to the calendar that
shall be published by the Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial
Development for such purpose;

That on 28 April 2000, the Agreement, which sets out the calendar of
registration and notification obligations to register before the National
Registry of Vehicles by establishing dates for the compliance of the
obligations derived from the Law of the National Vehicle Registry in its
pilot phase for the states of Hidalgo and San Luis Potosi, as well as the
calendar for the fulfillment of the obligations which derive from the same
law and its regulation in its national phase in respect to new vehicles, was
published in the Official Gazette of the Federation.

That on 8 June of the present year, the Agreement, which sets out the
calendar of registration and notification obligations before the National
Registry of Vehicles in its national phase, with the purpose that the
individuals that are bound by the Law of the National Vehicle Registry and
the Regulation submit the notifications and register vehicles in circulation
which are referred to in the ordinances, was published in the Official
Gazette of the Federation.

Part IV — Page 50

That in order to achieve the well-functioning and coverage of the National
Registry of Vehicles, suspension of the obligation to register vehicles in
circulation has been considered while the execution of coordination
agreements with the federative entities is concluded so that the
information contained in the vehicle lists of the federative entities and of
the Federal District can be relied on and the cost to the individual can be
removed;

That auto theft mainly affects recent vehicle models, and in order to
prevent and fight this offence, it is considered imperative to give continuity
to the public service of the Registry in relation to new vehicles. As
provided by article two of the Agreement which sets out the calendar of
obligations to register and give notice to the National Vehicle Registry,
published on 28 April 2000 in the Official Gazette of the Federation, I
have decided to issue the following:

DECREE THAT REVOKES ARTICLE ONE OF THE AGREEMENT
WHICH SETS OUT THE CALENDAR OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO
REGISTER AND GIVE NOTICE TO THE NATIONAL VEHICLE
REGISTRY AND REVOKES THE AGREEMENT WHICH SETS OUT THE
CALENDAR OF THE OBLIGATIONS TO REGISTER AND GIVE
NOTICE TO THE NATIONAL VEHICLE REGISTRY IN ITS NATIONAL
PHASE.”
4-148 This announcement was followed on the same day by an ‘administrative intervention’ in
the operation of the Registry. It was the first of two different administrative

interventions ordered by the Secretariat.

(24) The First Administrative Intervention

4-149 15.09.2000: On 15 September 2000, the Secretariat ordered the first ‘Administrative
Intervention’ directed at the Concessionaire. This intervention was justified by
reference to "a situation which has generated uncertainty among the users of the service
and the public in general, in relation to the confidentiality of information contained in

the database of the National Vehicle Registry”.

Part IV — Page 51

4-150 The decree ordering the administrative intervention provided (inter alia) as follows:

“WHEREAS

That with the aim of urgently confronting a situation which has generated
uncertainty among the users of the service and the public in general, in
relation to the confide ty of ii i ined in the datab of
the National Vehicle Reins the Secretariat has published a decree
ordering the technical intervention of the public service of the said

Registry in the Official Gazette of the Federation.

That it is of great importance to address the concerns generated by the
functioning of the concession of the public service as to the operation of
the National Vehicle Registry, which led to the cessation of the
registration of used vehicles; and

That the foregoing lets us conclude that circumstances subsist which
prevent the concessionaire from maintaining the optimal operation of the
service. Therefore, the Secretariat is authorized to intervene, not only in
the technical aspects in relation to the integrity and confidentiality of the
Registry’s database, but also to intervene in the administration of the
concessionaire, as a precautionary and necessary measure. That will
enable supervision of its functioning. Due to the extraordinary
circumstances which have arisen, I have decided to issue the following:

DECREE WHICH DECLARES THE ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVENTION
OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF THE NATIONAL REGISTRY OF
VEHICLES

ARTICLE 1. The Federal Government, through the Secretariat of
Commerce and Industrial Development, declares the administrative
intervention of the public service of operation of the National Vehicle
Registry in all the national territory.

ARTICLE 2. The Federal Government, through the Secretariat of
Commerce and Industrial Development, shall appoint an administrative
intervener, as well as other persons who may be required to perform his
duties.

The administrative intervener, with the purpose of maintaining the optimal
operation of the public service:

L- Shall hold the office of intervener with the authorities and powers
inherent to the general director.

IL- Shall take administrative and operative control.

Part IV — Page 52

4-151

4-152

4-153

II.- Shall answer to the Secretary and shall inform him periodically
about the development of the intervention.

IV.- Shall exercise the necessary authority to guarantee the integrity
and confidentiality of information contained in the Registry.

V.- Shall take all other actions which the Secretary authorizes.

ARTICLE 3. Concesionaria RENAVE, S.A. de C.V. shall grant the
intervener all the necessary powers for the achievement of its objectives in
accordance with article 20, numeral X of the Law of the National Vehicle
Registry and the provisions established in the twelfth condition, paragraph
15 of the Title of Concession.

ARTICLE 4. The Secretary shall decide when this intervention shall cease,

after evaluating the conditions which gave rise to it.”
Within the Secretariat, the individual officer responsible for these two decrees of 15
September 2000 was again Dr Blanco (as with the earlier decree of 29 August 2000). It
is to be noted that neither of these two decrees was based on any “imminent peril for the
national security” under the first part of Article 25 of the Act (cited above). It was not
intended that the suspension of the legal obligation to register used vehicles should be
permanent; and this administrative intervention was to be temporary: see Article 4 of

the second decree above.

The administrative intervener was to be the former technical intervener, Mr Marin. He
thereby assumed administrative authority over the Concessionaire’s General Director
(Mr Bilbao) and reported directly to the Secretariat. Over the course of his tenure as the
first administrative intervener, Mr Marin remitted several written reports to the
Secretariat on the operations and financial situation of the company. Again, the Tribunal

has found these reports objective, professional and useful.

19.10.2000: Mr Marin issued his first report as Administrative Intervener on 19 October

2000, proposing several measures to be implemented by the Concessionaire.

Among matters discussed in Mr Marin’s first report were the results of GCI’s technical
review of the confidentiality of information held by the Registry and registration cards

for both new and used vehicles:

Part IV — Page 53

“SECURITY EVALUATION. [...]

The evaluation reveals a wide variety of insecure conditions in the vehicle
registration service of information security operations as well as express
and implied suggestions for the correction of these conditions. The
analysis was centred on the three main nodes located at the premises of
Hewlett Packard Mexico, Keon de México, and of Concesionaria Renave
itself. It covered the equipment, applications, operating systems,
databases, measures to protect the physical and logical aspects of the
operations, processing, accesses, teleprocessing, information integrity,
ete.

Within the overall scope of the study, and the different levels of impact,
importance and significance that the inadequate security conditions
encountered may have, which are directly related to the security levels
specified in the “prospectus” and the bid terms on which this service is
based, below is a summary of the most significant:

. “The security specification of the equipment, components,
databases, and operating systems must be at least B2.” (page 124
of the prospectus). The technical evaluation verified that the B2
security level is not reached at any of the computing nodes in the
concessionary’s network, not even at the main node located at HP
Mexico. [...]

. As a corollary to the above and in accordance with your
instructions to “evaluate the operation of the company to
determine possible grounds for termination of the concession”, the
conclusion to be drawn is that it has been demonstrated that the
points mentioned constitute clear grounds for terminating the
concession. Assuming the possibility that the concession might be
revoked, I consider that it is essential to:

° Determine and prepare all the technical, administrative,
legal, and media necessary activities.

° Define a new “prospectus” in which the Renave’s
operating process is redesigned and resized to include only
new vehicles (May 2000 and later) and changes of
ownership of the same, as well as miscellaneous
appropriate notices established provided for in the
prospectus. ...

REGISTRATION CARDS FOR USED VEHICLES. About 200,000
applications for registration with different dates of origin are currently
being processed. In accordance with regulations, within three months of
the receipt of an application a registration card should be issued or an
explanation given as to why a card has not been issued. Given the very
few cooperation agreements with the States and the incompleteness of the
information contained in the federal databases (SAT and SNSP), the
resumption of the used vehicle registration service will translate into the
necessity of informing the people who submitted an application the
reasons why they will not receive their card, or if the cards are delivered,
of the restrictions attached to them because it will not have been possible
to make full checks of their conditions in the databases. The sensitive
nature of this matter warrants the definition by SECOFI of an appropriate
strategy in order to prevent dissatisfaction and further inconvenience. If
deemed necessary, this issue should be jointly agreed beforehand with the
appropriate authorities and appropriate social representatives. If the
service is definitely to be discontinued, the source of the money to be
refunded to the owners of the used cars shall need to be determined, as
well as the cost of this refund and proceed in the short-term to publish the
procedure for paying the people who have claimed refunds. The total
amount involved is estimated between 8 million and 12 million pesos, and
that the cooperation of the competent authorities will be necessary to
authorize the deduction of this expense.

REGISTRATION CARDS FOR NEW VEHICLES. These applications
continue to be processed normally. However, it is necessary to initiate a
communication campaign focusing particularly on new car owners (May
2000 or later) to inform them and future purchasers of their obligations
and benefits in terms of security by timely reporting changes in ownership
and the transfer of the registration card and the scratch-off card to the
new owner. The value and level of confidence associated with this solution
would be derived from the RENAVE database without the necessity of
resorting to the S.A.T. and S.N.S.P. databases. It will also be necessary
gradually to replace the services provided by the CTDs and CTDCs since
they are practically closed and do not offer the service anymore. It is
advisable to redesign the current regulations given that the new
circumstances do not correspond to it. Additionally, it will be necessary to
define the legal status that Renave smart card might have.”

It will be noted that Mr Marin here refers to the Secretariat’s instructions to him “to
evaluate the operation of the company to determine possible grounds for the termination
of the Concession”. Clearly, there was already an option being considered within the

Secretariat to terminate the Concession Agreement, taking place before the change in

Part IV — Page 55

4-155

the Federal Government’s political administration. The Tribunal concludes from the
evidence, particularly the testimony of Dr Blanco, that this was only one of several
policy options addressed by the Secretariat; and that it was not a plan, still less a
decision to terminate the Concession Agreement. Indeed, it would have been surprising,
given the public concerns being directed at the Concession, if the Secretariat had not
considered whether or not grounds existed to terminate the Concession and enlisted the

advice of Mr Marin.

03.01.2001: On 3 January 2001, following the replacement of Secretary Blanco by
Secretary Derbez under the new political administration of President Fox, Mr Marin
wrote to Secretary Derbez outlining a strategic proposal for the management of the

Concessionaire’s operations:

“The drastic fall in the number of used-vehicle registrations and the
subsequent suspension of the obligation to register them caused several
problems in the service contractual relationship with Keon de Mexico S.A.
de C.V. As a result of this situation, registration was interrupted and
information on almost 50% of the people who applied to register their
used vehicles is missing. Furthermore, although it will not all be useful
now, the physical file containing the copies of documents delivered by the
applicants is in a sense being held “semi-hostage” in Keon because of the
financial problems caused by the known events. One of the critical
problems caused by this situation is that it is impossible to obtain the
minimum information needed to correctly make refunds to almost 50% of
those applicants.

Given the important public nature of this physical file, it is necessary that
the Secretariat decides and orders the physical relocation of this file to the
Concessionaire’s premises or to another location, in accordance with its
instructions. By acting on this suggestion, we would have the security
required to make the refund mentioned earlier.

The report dated 22 November 2000 described the severe difficulties
experienced and the mistakes committed by both the Concessionaire and
“GemPlus”, which impeded production of new-vehicle registration cards
as of that date. As of today, although some progress has been made, not a
single new registration card has yet been produced.

This failure is in breach of the regulation and merits an official warning
from the Secretariat. [...]”

Part IV — Page 56

4-156

4-157

4-158

At this time, there was apparently no suggestion that the Concession might be
requisitioned, revoked or terminated by the Secretariat under the Act or the Concession

Agreement itself.

01.02.2001: One month later, on 1 February 2001, Mr Marin submitted a further written
report to Secretary Derbez, concluding as follows with regard to the Concessionaire’s
financial status: “From a financial stand point, the figures reported in the
Concessionaire’s financial statements show a satisfactory trend. This situation will
enable the necessary adjustments to be made to its structure, procedures and operations
so as to achieve the level of service and quality demanded by both the legislation and
the population. In combination with the low operation volumes, this financial position

will enable the internal control procedures to be strengthened.”

Mr Marin recommended that several measures be taken in respect of the
Concessionaire’s financial reporting, including the following: “There is an urgent need
to implement the organisational elements, procedures and controls required to ensure
the suitability and quality of the services, as well as those of the information on which

the financial statements are based.”
With regard to services, Mr Marin reported the following:

“SERVICES NOT AWARDED

At the express request of Mr Luis Young [of the Secretariat's Under-
Secretary], the Concessionaire commenced evaluation of the degree of
compliance with entry in the tax register, particularly for new vehicles. To
date, talks have been held with organisations offering both finance lease
and true lease arrangements. In both cases, it has been confirmed that as
the vehicles are invoiced to the lessor, which therefore holds ownership,
entry in the tax register is not applicable.

As regards the automobile finance companies and other non-specialised
finance companies that also work in the automobile market, entry in the
tax register is applicable. Of the total number of approximately 300
finance companies, only I] are entered in the system. To date, of 466,000
new vehicles registered, only 135,000 have been entered in the tax
register, a figure that is below the forecast result.

Part IV — Page 57

As regards this situation, four main errors are observed. I.- An
insufficient number of notifications from vehicle Distributors. 2.-Wrongful
collection of the fee [...] from owners. 3.- Lack of confirmation sent to
RENAVE by finance companies and 4. — Payment of the fee applicable to
them.

The aforementioned errors mean that the legislation is not complied with
and that significant financial losses are incurred by the company. It is
estimated that to date approximately 3.5 million pesos have not been
collected.

RECOMMENDED MEASURES

As a result of the aforementioned, the necessary instructions have been
issued to reorganise and activate the required systems and procedures so
that within the shortest possible period of time (March): 1° No new vehicle
may be sold on credit without the corresponding tax being registered. 2° A
review of the previous months will be undertaken to endeavour to recover
and update the databases and corresponding charges.”

4-159 Finally, Mr Marin reported continuing problems with regard to the delivery of

registration documents, i.e. smart cards, recommending the following measures:

“PROGRESS IN THE DELIVERY OF REGISTRATION CARDS

As previously mentioned, this has been one of the critical problems with
the Concessionaire’s operations; the procedures that have somehow
delayed delivery have been reactivated; we have established controls to
keep a daily track of the production process, we have sustained
conversations and established schedules to comply with the commitment of
the timely delivery of cards and have made strong complaints to the
provider for the significant backlog, however, to this date, we have been
unable to recover and it is practically in worse condition than a month
ago.

From a total of approximately 420,000 registration applications received
in the course of this month approximately 242,000 registrations we have
delivered to the provider Gemplus, of which only 12,500 have been
produced and sent to the users. The situation is still serious. Adding to the
situation is the fact that the provider [Gemplus] is also an important
shareholder in the Concessionaire.

Once again we are seeing a problem of management control and this
indicates the urgent need to structure the MANAGEMENT CONTROL
function. The company Freysinnier y Morin has already been requested to
provide a proposal with a view to institutionalizing the control of all the
Concessionaire’s administrative and service processes.”

Part IV — Page 58

4-160

4-161

16.04.2001: Mr Marin submitted a further written report on 16 April 2001, with
comments on the Concessionaire’s financial status and an explanation of the strategies
and measures adopted to improve the operation and future service of the Registry.

Amongst those general conclusions presented in the report were the following:

“First general conclusion. This first analysis shows that the technological
infrastructure does not represent the most significant account asset
although it supports the entire operation; paradoxically, since it is a
financially sound operation, liquidity exceeds by far the normal
requirements of its activity.

[ou]

On the other hand it is important to draw the Second Conclusion [...]
regarding the positive Treasury changes that enable current liabilities to
be covered more than enough by current assets as of these dates.

[ou]

Important changes such as cancellation of the KEON service, reduction of
the AVANTEL service and termination of the Tecmarketing service lead us
to a third conclusion, namely, to take the necessary action for the
appropriate regrouping and relocation of the several cost items and
accounts so that the operating costs may be reviewed more accurately.

[ou]

Fourth conclusion: The imminent termination of the concession entails
studying the total financial plan in order to forecast the return once all the
services which are now incipient or which have not been provided are
fully expedited.”
It is to be noted that Mr Marin here refers to the “imminent termination” of the
Concession. It is to be inferred that between his report of 1 February 2001 and this report
of 16 April 2001, a decision was taken within the Secretariat to terminate the Concession,
communicated to Mr Marin. This conclusion is confirmed by a later passage in the report

of 16 April 2001 and other evidence to which the Tribunal returns below.

Mr Marin further informed the Secretariat that delays in the issuance of 340,000

registrations, in the aggregate, were “fully overcome” as of the date of his report.

Part IV — Page 59

4-162 However, Mr Marin also identified continuing difficulties resulting from the refusal of
the Federal District and other state entities to cooperate with the Registry, noting as
regards the registration of new cars (which had not been suspended under the decree of

15 September 2000):

“Mr. Luis Young has been made aware of this matter and, in principle, it
has been concluded that since there are no applicable rules clearly and
specifically requiring owners of new cars to register them with RENAVE,
there is no power to demand that they do so. As regards the above, I
consider that our efforts in this respect will be unsuccessful since the
responsibility to register is limited to the distributors or dealers that sell
new cars.

We are concerned about the fact that the Federal District Government’s
attitude of denial may be imitated by other entities in the Republic.”

4-163 Finally, Mr Marin sought directions as to the further steps to be taken under his
administrative intervention, adverting to a “warning” to him by the General Director of

the National Vehicle Registry, Mr Young Fonseca:

“It is publicly known that the population is waiting for significant changes
in the service and operation of the RENAVE. Likewise the
Concessionaire’s personnel is concerned about its future and that of its
staff. Termination of the concession is presumed and the legal way in
which the service will be continued or changed remains unknown. It is
acknowledged that it is wholly unlikely that the present situation will be
maintained for a long time.

 

In view of such reality and my duties I wish to tell you that I assume my
obligation to support the Secretariat as regards all such matters as are
deemed to be necessary and for that reason I hereby request that a
hearing be held so that I may receive your guidelines and thus pave the
way for the future transformation of this entity.

LJ

On Tuesday 10" of this current month [i.e. 10 April 2001] I received a
warning from [the General Director of the National Vehicle Registry] [...]
reading as follows:

Part IV — Page 60

4-164

4-165

‘T require that in your capacity as controller of the public service of the
National Vehicle Registry subordinate to this Secretariat of Finance, you
limit your action to verify that Concesionaria Renave S.A. de C.V.
guarantees security of the information contained in the National Vehicle
Registry by observing the principles of confidentiality of the information
and that you supervise Concesionaria Renave S.A. de C.V.’s management
as regards the provision of the public service and inform this Secretariat
of Finance of the course of supervision as established in the Agreement
....' dated September 15", 2000.

I am not aware of the reason for the ‘requirement’ because this is not
explained in the written notice in question. With all due respect and as you
will understand I cannot accept such a requirement without a broad and
satisfactory explanation thereon.

In view of the above, I request that I get a fair hearing so that I can
understand the reasons for the requirement and, if pertinent, give you all
the answers that may be necessary to clarify any misunderstanding
regarding the difficult responsibility which has been conferred upon me.

You may be sure that I fully complied with the duties of my office.

Likewise, I confirm to you that I remain at your disposal to tender my

resignation to the office when circumstances may so require or when you

may so decide.”
By the date of this report (16 April 2001), it is clear that active consideration was being
given within the Secretariat as to how to terminate of the Concession Agreement in one
form or another, including the dismissal of Mr Marin as the administrative intervener. As
this report records, “Termination of the concession is presumed and the legal way in
which the service will be continued or changed remains unknown”; but it was evidently
to be linked, somehow, to the “security of the information contained in the National

Vehicle Registry”.

On the evidence adduced in these proceedings, it is equally clear that such consideration
did not originate from Mr Marin but, rather, from new political figures within the

Secretariat, including Secretary Derbez.

04.05.2001: On 4 May 2001, Mr Marin submitted his final report to Secretary Derbez,
identifying further areas for improvement in the Concessionaire’s work but stating that

“the operation has been normalized”.

Part IV — Page 61

4-166 Among those issues listed as “pending”, Mr Marin identified the following:

“2.2.1 Agreement with the National Public Security Service, and/or
otherwise agreements with the States’ Attorney's Office regarding the
exchange of information as to Vehicle Theft Notices or certification of
Change of Ownership Notices. This is an essential tool in the quality and
reliability RENAVE offers to users, to be supported by the timely
certification of a vehicle’s ownership. Notwithstanding that in September
2000 the authorization registration [sic] in the second hand vehicle system
was suspended, the natural aging of new vehicles in circulation from May
2000, requires certification of vehicle ownership in the national database,
given the increasing number of changes in ownership. Without such a
process in place, the RENAVE is unwarranted and lacks grounds to exist.

2.2.2 Agreement with the Tax Administration Service and/or otherwise,
agreements with States and Municipalities to exchange information from
their vehicle registries. Similarly to the previous item, the possibility of
querying the system from across the whole country is beneficial and
necessary for all the States as well as vehicle owners.

2.2.3 Reinstatement of the service of Change of Ownership Notice for New
Vehicles beginning in May 2000. The incentive to reinstate this service
through Distributors and Dealers and given the closure of over 2000
CTDs and CTDCs has not been fruitful. From October to present, only
less than 100 Change of Ownership notices have been registered.”

4-167 Mr Marin proposed the following strategic action, noting that “[a]ll the measures
suggested are deemed feasible, although some of them are not directly dependent on the

Concessionaire, and therefore it is not possible to define deadlines”:

“4.1 Production of smart cards by Assemblers and delivery of smart cards
with the vehicle of Distributors or Dealers.

4.2 Customization of smart cards at the Distributors and production of
invoices therein to deliver them to owners with the vehicle.

4.3 Coordination agreements with S.A.T., S.N.S.P. and S.C.T.

44 New incentives with States and Federal District
Administrations for the acceptance and support of a National Vehicle
Registry, with an electronic connection to their vehicle ‘registries’ at the
state and municipal level, that renders a high quality public service to
citizens overall.

 

4.5 In view of the uncertainty expressed by the public, users, and related
organizations as to the future of the public service created by the National

Part IV — Page 62

4-168

4-169

4-170

Vehicle Registry Act, it is necessary to decide upon the future of the

service and the Concession.”
The Tribunal notes Mr Marin’s references to the current “uncertainty” over the National
Vehicle Registry. It is also to be noted that Mr Marin emphasises a need by the
Secretariat “to decide upon the future of the service and the Concession”. It was by now
almost eight months since Secretary Blanco’s decrees of 15 September 2000 envisaging
a temporary solution, limiting registration to new vehicles; the project for the National
Vehicle Registry still required the registration of both new and used vehicles; the
Concession remained in place, albeit limited to the registration of new vehicles; and the

Secretariat was still searching for a means to terminate the Concession Agreement.

Shortly following Mr Marin’s report of 4 May 2001, he was replaced as the
administrative intervener of the Concessionaire, thereby marking the beginning of the
Secretariat’s second administrative intervention. The latter was of a quite different
character. Mr Marin had not determined that there was any breach in the Registry’s
security or other leakage of confidential information; he did not advise that there was
any imminent peril to national security; and whilst he did identify several technical
defects in the work of the Concessionaire, these were remediable and did not justify the
termination of the Concession. The second intervener was instructed to pursue a

different approach by the Secretariat, as the Tribunal recites below.

(25) The Second Administrative Intervention

18.04.2001: On 18 April 2001, Mr Luis Pablo Monreal Loustaunau of the Secretariat
prepared an internal memorandum to Secretary Derbez and others, including Dr Maria
del Refugio Gonzalez (General Director of the Secretariat’s Legal Service), concerning
the first administrative intervention under Mr Marin. It was sharply critical of Mr

Marin.

Part IV — Page 63

4-171

4-172

4-173

This memorandum read (inter alia) as follows:

"Throughout the period of administrative intervention, 15 September 2000
to date), the intervener has been carrying out his tasks in the terms
requested by this Ministry; however, given the time the intervention has
lasted, I feel he has lost power and presence with the concessionaire.

This is detrimental to the intention of the intervention and is causing,
among other things, problems in the information flow necessary for the
process of valuing the concessionaire and terminating the concession.
There is thus a need to take relevant steps to reinforce the process."
Mr Monreal concluded his memorandum by proposing the appointment of a new
administrative intervener. It is to be noted that the memorandum reflects a decision by the
Secretariat to terminate the Concession, as at mid-April 2001. This conclusion is

supported by the passages in Mr Marin’s report of 16 April 2001: see above.

During this same period, i.e. between April and May 2001, Dr Maria del Refugio
Gonzalez (Dr. Gonzalez) prepared an “Information Note” for Secretary Derbez "with
reference to the possibility of seizing the RENAVE”. Dr Gonzélez was not a witness in
these proceedings; but her high standing and good reputation in legal affairs was
acknowledged by both sides. The fact that her legal advice was sought by the Secretariat
is itself significant: it confirms that from a time in April 2001 onwards a team working
at a senior level within the Federal Government was giving serious consideration to the
requisition or termination of the Concession in one form or another. The content of her

written advice provides further corroboration.

In her Note, Dr Gonzalez made the following observations on the question posed to her

for legal advice:

Part IV — Page 64

In fact, Article 25 of the Law regarding RENAVE stipulates the
seizure of the operations and installations centre, movable
property, immovable property and equipment assigned for
operating the Register, always and whenever ‘there is any
imminent danger to national security, peace within the country or
to the national economy’. From the perspective of the working
team, none of these assumptions can be demonstrated for the time
being. Moreover, one could consider the fact that the RENAVE
Law does not indicate whether indemnity is appropriate; other
laws which provide for seizures, in certain cases consider
indemnity whilst in other cases they do not. Lastly, it is fitting to
point out that in the case of RENAVE, there is no similarity either
with the labour requisitions or with the bank interventions, since
both have been developed in each applicable law.

From this perspective, it would be much closer to the law and
much safer to begin work through intervention according to the
terms of the intervention Agreement and leave seizure until a later
stage, if this is the case. In our opinion, the intervener would be the
one indicated to inform the Secretary if in the development of the
tasks inherent in the intervention there are to be found elements
which make it possible a) to revoke the dealership; b) to impose
legal sanctions; c) to carry out the seizure.

It is possible that up to now intervention did not work adequately.
However, this fact may have various explanations: a) the
conditions in which the current intervener began; b) the
personality of the intervener; c) the way in which the intervener is
linked to the concessionaire and d) the uncooperative attitude of
the latter. The new intervention is based on healthier grounds,
whereby it seems sensible to expect positive results.

[ou]

It is necessary to point out that although seizure is an aspect
provided for by the same law, according to the historical
experience it was only resorted to in very specific cases with
regard to imminent danger, which in the case of RENAVE would
tend to be for national security or the economy. Seizure would be
justified if the intervener were to find huge missing elements in the
automobile register, misuse of information provided by
individuals, handling of false documents, knowing that they were
being duplicated for the benefit of third parties or some similar
assumptions. If that is not so, the Ministry of the Economy would
find it impossible to take any action.”

Part IV — Page 65

4-174

4-175

4-176

Accordingly, this senior legal adviser was expressing, unambiguously, her opinion as to
the lack of any present basis for the Requisition or Revocation of the Concession under
Article 25 of the Act and, in particular, the absence of any grounds based on national
security. Her advice also suggested an alternative strategy: first, the appointment of a new
intervener and, subject to new and material information provided by that intervener, the

possible seizure of the Concession “at a later stage”, if this is the case.

07.05.2001: On 7 May 2001, Ms Maria de la Esperanza Guadalupe Gémez-Mont
Urueta was appointed as the new administrative intervenor, in succession to Mr Marin.
Notwithstanding her political qualities and connections, she was a quite different kind
of person from Mr Marin. It is clear that she acted at all times in strict accordance with

the Secretariat’s instructions and objectives.

It is also clear on the evidence before this Tribunal that Secretary Derbez instructed Ms
G6émez-Mont on her appointment to determine whether any reasons existed to revoke
the Concession or otherwise adversely affect the Concessionaire. By itself, this was not
necessarily an improper instruction; but, in the Tribunal’s view, it was the first step in a
concerted pattern of malign conduct within the Federal Government which was to lead
to the Concession’s Requisition on 25 June 2001 and its eventual Revocation on 13
December 2002. Such conduct was known to have no justifiable legal basis by the
Respondent, acting by its Secretariat. Yet, a decision was reached by the Secretariat, by
mid-April 2001, to ‘pull the plug’ on the Concession regardless of whether or not it was
legally justified; and the manner and timing of such termination was dictated by a
strategy calculated to minimise the risk of legal proceedings and the payment of

compensation to the Concessionaire (including the Claimants).

The Tribunal records its regret that Secretary Derbez and his close colleagues at the
Secretariat were not called by the Respondent as witnesses in these arbitration
proceedings. It would have been helpful to the Tribunal to test the conclusions drawn
from the contemporary documentation against their testimony, if different. As it is, the
Tribunal can only decide these much disputed matters on the evidence adduced before it

in these proceedings, as to which the contemporary documentation is conclusive.

Part IV — Page 66

(26) The Requisition

4-177 25.06.2001: On 25 June 2001, by decree, the Secretariat ordered the “requisition” of the
Concessionaire’s operations on grounds of national security under Article 25 of the Act.

No other grounds were advanced by the Secretariat at the time.
4-178 The decree ordering the Requisition provided as follows:

“WHEREAS

[ou]

That the deterioration in the operation of the public service of the
National Vehicle Registry threatens national security since, as the
legislator stated in the reasons for enacting the Law of the National
Vehicle Registry, said Registry guarantees the protection of the rights of
vehicle ownership of the Mexican people;

That by means of the Agreement published in the Official Gazette of the
Federation on 29 August 2000, the Secretariat of Commerce and
Industrial Development, now the Secretariat of the Economy, declared the
technical intervention of the public service of the National Vehicle
Registry, with the purpose of confronting the uncertainty generated among
the users of the National Vehicle Registry and the public in general, in
relation to the confidentiality of the information contained in the database
necessary for the rendering of the service;

That the then-Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development, now
the Secretariat of the Economy, determined the existence of circumstances
preventing Concesionaria Renave, S.A. de C.V. from operating the service
in an optimal fashion, which persisted, and therefore, by means of the
Decree published in the Official Gazette of the Federation on 15
September 2000, declared, as a precautionary measure, the administrative
intervention of the public service of the National Vehicle Registry, with the
purpose of intervening not only the technical aspects related to the
integrity and confidentiality of the database, but also the administration of
the company;

Part IV — Page 67

That the results recently obtained during the aforementioned
administrative intervention demonstrate that Concesionaria Renave, S.A.
de C.V., has provided the public service of operation of the National
Vehicle Registry in a deficient manner, and consequently the registry is
not fully complying with its purpose, and as a consequence, not providing
legal security to users of the same and not guaranteeing the confidentiality
of information provided by them in relation to the vehicles, with imminent
peril to national security;

That the deficient provision of the public service undertaken by
Concesionaria Renave, S.A. de C.V., is due, amongst other things, to
inadequate administration and operation practices, which, together with
the lack of measures taken by the Concessionaire aimed at avoiding them
may provoke deterioration of the security measures necessary to
guarantee the adequate functioning of the Registry, which represents an
imminent peril to national security, since it generates incongruities in the
information contained in the Registry’s database, and uncertainty with
respect to the legal origin of the vehicles registered in it;

That the foregoing requires that the Federal Executive, through the
Secretariat of the Economy, take immediate action to correct such
practices, reorienting the operation of the public service by means of the
requisition, which will allow the broadening of the controls currently
available to the administrative intervention; and

That Article 25 of the Law of the National Vehicle Registry, grants the
Secretariat of the Economy, the power to requisition the operations centre
and other facilities, real estate, goods and equipment committed to the
operation of the Registry, as well as to dispose of the personnel employed
by the company that operates the registry, when imminent peril to national
security exists, I have decided to issue the following:

DECREE FOR THE REQUISITION OF THE PUBLIC SERVICE OF THE
OPERATION OF THE NATIONAL VEHICLE REGISTRY GRANTED IN
FAVOUR OF CONCESIONARIA RENAVE, S.A. DE C.V.

ARTICLE FIRST.- The Federal Executive, through the Secretariat of the
Economy, pursuant to Article 25 of the Law of the National Vehicle
Registry, requisitions the operations centre and other facilities, real estate
goods and equipment committed to the operation of the public service of
the National Vehicle Registry performed by Concesionaria Renave, S.A.
de C.V., due to the imminent peril to national security that its inadequate
functioning represents.

27.06.2001: Two days later, on 27 June 2001, Secretary Derbez appointed Ms Gémez-

Mont as the general administrator of the Requisition under this decree.

The factual chronology established by the Tribunal above, running from Secretary
Blanco’s decree of 29 August 2000 to the information note of Dr Maria del Refugio
Gonzélez and Mr Marin’s final report of 4 May 2001 establishes that the Secretariat’s
invocation of “imminent peril to national security” was a pretence and known to be

factually false to the Secretariat on 26 June 2001.

As to the conduct of this Requisition, it is unnecessary here to say much. In effect, the
Secretariat, acting through Ms Gémez-Mont took over the running of the Concession,

displacing the Concessionaire.

25.04.2002: On 25 April 2002, Mr Monreal wrote to Secretary Derbez concerning a
report made by Ms Gémez-Mont two days earlier in which various deficiencies had
been identified in the operations of the Concessionaire (this report was not, however,
produced by the Respondent in these arbitration proceedings). In particular, Mr
Monreal indicated apparent failures to comply or inconsistencies with the Act, the

Concession Agreement and other applicable regulations.

It will be necessary later in this Award to return in detail to the Secretariat’s overall
conduct as regards the Requisition and its implementation from 25 June 2001 to 13
December 2002, when the Secretariat revoked the Concession. For reasons there set out,
the Tribunal finds that during this period the Respondent was responsible for a pattern
of conduct that can only be characterised as irrational, perverse and tainted with bad

faith towards the Concessionaire.

(27) The Revocation

4-184 13.12.2002: On 13 December 2002, the Secretariat revoked the Concession Agreement.

4-185 In the decree revoking the concession, published several days later on 17 December

2002, the following reasons for the Revocation were identified by the Secretariat:

“WHEREAS

[ou]

On several occasions, Concesionaria Renave, S.A. de C.V., infringed the
rules applicable to the Registro Nacional de Vehiculos; therefore,
pursuant to Sections 21, subsections II and 22, subsections I, V and IX of
the Law of the Registro Nacional de Vehiculos, on December 13, 2002, the
Secretariat of Economy revoked the Concession Instrument of the public
service of operation of the Registro Nacional de Vehiculos, granted to
Concessionaria Renave, S.A. de C.V.; such revocation was notified to
Concesionaria Renave, S.A. de C.V. on December 16, 2002 and published
in the Official Bulletin of the Federation on December 17, 2002;

One of the reasons for the revocation of the Concession Instrument of the
public service of operation of the Registro Nacional de Vehiculos
consisted in Concessionaria Renave, S.A. de C.V.’s failure to implement
the infrastructure required and the necessary systems for the public
service of the operation of the Registro Nacional de Vehiculos to be
rendered in the manner provided for by the applicable rules; ...”
4-186 It is necessary to return to these decrees as to Requisition and Revocation in detail later
in this Award. It suffices to record that neither were justifiable on any factual basis in
the previous work of Mr Marin, Dra del Refugio Gonzalez and others, as adduced in

these arbitration proceedings.

4-187 For reasons set out later in this Award, the Tribunal finds that, as regards the
Revocation, the Respondent was responsible for further conduct that, like the earlier
Requisition, can only be characterised as irrational, perverse and tainted with bad faith

towards the Concessionaire.

Part IV — Page 70

4-188

4-189

4-190

4-191

As at 13 December 2002, the Concession had registered 2.2 million new vehicles. As a
business concern, it could be regarded as profitable. It was still not, of course,
registering used vehicles; the registration of new vehicles was therefore unduly
remunerative (being intended to subsidise the costs of registering used vehicles); and it
was not therefore operating as the National Vehicle Registry originally intended by the
Respondent and, indeed, the Concessionaire. The Concession was effectively operating
as a quite different and much more limited project, as it had since Secretary Blanco’s

decree of 15 September 2000.

As at 24 June 2001, immediately prior to the Requisition, there remained, objectively, a
reasonable hope that the project, temporarily curtailed by Dr Blanco, could be restored
as a National Vehicle Registry for both new and used vehicles operated by the
Concessionaire - provided that the Respondent did not conduct itself unlawfully in
breach of its obligations under the two BITs. There were, of course, many other
difficulties facing the Concessionaire, flowing directly from the Cavallo incident and Dr
Ramos’ death. It is therefore necessary later in this Award to assess that objective hope:

it was, in short, a ‘possibility’ and not a ‘probability’.

(28) Legal Proceedings against the Federal Government

Following the technical intervention initiated on 29 August 2000, the Concessionaire
began several judicial and administrative proceedings in Mexico to challenge various
acts and decisions of the Secretariat. None of the Claimants were parties to these
proceedings; and none of their present claims under the two BITs were advanced in

those proceedings by the Concessionaire.

On 20 September 2000, the Concessionaire initiated a review proceeding against the
Technical Intervention. The Concessionaire contended that the Technical Intervention
was not contemplated in any legal instrument and that the decree which authorized it

established neither its scope nor its duration. The Secretariat ruled against the

Part IV — Page 71

4-192

4-193

4-194

4-195

4-196

4-197

Concessionaire on 8 January 2001, on the ground the Technical Intervention had been
implicitly revoked by the decree ordering the First Administrative Intervention on 15

September 2000.

The Concessionaire also instituted an amparo against this First Administrative
Intervention and the acts of the first intervenor (Mr Marin). On 13 December 2000, the
Sixth District judge on Administrative Matters in the Federal District dismissed the case
in regards to the acts of the intervenor and denied the amparo. The learned judge did
not, in this proceeding, determine the legality of the intervention vis-a-vis the
Concession Agreement. The Concessionaire filed a challenge against this ruling in

April 2001.

On 31 August 2001, the Sixth Collegiate Tribunal on Administrative Matters of the First
Circuit dismissed the challenge because the Concessionaire had not filed a copy of the

Concession Agreement with the first instance judge.

On 30 October 2000, the Secretariat published the Rules of Operation of the Registry.
The Concessionaire filed a review proceeding on 21 November 2000 concerning the
adoption of the Rules of Operation, requesting a suspension of these Rules until the
merits of its request regarding the Rules had been considered. The Secretariat dismissed

this request for suspension on 28 November 2000.

The Concessionaire filed an amparo against the Secretariat’s refusal to suspend the
application of the Rules, which was denied on 18 January 2001 by the Second Judge on

Administrative Matters of the Federal District.

On 20 February 2001, the Secretariat ruled against the Concessionaire and confirmed
the Rules of Operation. On 2 May 2001, the Concessionaire filed an annulment claim
before the Federal Court for Tax and Administrative Justice (the “TJFA”) against the

Secretariat’s decision to confirm the Rules of Operation.

On 23 April 2003, the TJFA annulled the Rules of Operation and the Secretariat’s
administrative decision confirming them; and it ordered that the Concessionaire’s

complaint be heard.

Part IV — Page 72

4-198

4-199

4-200

4-201

4-202

The Secretariat filed an appeal from the TJFA’s ruling for failure to consider the
supervening event of the Revocation of the Concession Agreement (which had taken
place on 13 December 2002). The TJFA’s ruling was ordered set aside on 11 February
2004 by the Fourth Collegiate Tribunal on Administrative Matters of the First Circuit.
The TJFA subsequently set aside its original ruling; and it suspended the annulment
proceeding concerning the Rules of Operation pending the outcome of the annulment

proceeding concerning the Revocation of the Concession Agreement.

Following several other challenges by both the Concessionaire and the Secretariat, the
TJFA again annulled, on 11 February 2005, the Rules of Operation and the Secretariat’s
administrative decision. Following a final appeal by the Secretariat, the TJFA

dismissed the case on 11 July 2005.

On 7 September 2001, the Concessionaire initiated an annulment proceeding before the
TJFA against the Requisition of 25 June 2001, requesting the suspension of the
requisition. On 3 June 2002, the request was denied by the TJFA. The Concessionaire
initiated an amparo against this ruling, which was denied on September 2002. The
Concessionaire then appealed this decision. The Concessionaire’s appeal was dismissed
on 26 May 2003 on the ground that the Requisition had ceased to exist as of 13
December 2002, when the Secretariat revoked the Concession Agreement. Following
another round of pleadings, the TJFA confirmed the dismissal of these proceedings on 9
January 2005. The Concessionaire filed an amparo against this decision on August

2005 which was also denied on 9 February 2006.

On 7 March 2003, the Concessionaire filed an annulment proceeding against the
Revocation of the Concession Agreement and requested the suspension of the order of
Revocation. As of the date of this Award, it appears that this annulment proceeding
remains pending before the TJFA. Accordingly, the TJFA has yet to decide on the

legality of the Secretariat’s Revocation of the Concession Agreement.

These several court proceedings in Mexico are complicated, lengthy and incomplete;
and this summary omits other proceedings taken by other persons in regard to the

concessionaire and the Secretariat. Save for one minor issue (to which the Tribunal

Part IV — Page 73

4-203

4-204

returns later below), the Tribunal considers these court proceedings to be irrelevant to
the principal issues addressed in this Award. Moreover, although the Claimants
complain of a denial of justice where the Mexican courts “bent over backwards” to
defeat the Concessionaire’s rightful claims, the Claimants do not advance any claim for
denial of justice in these proceedings [D1.56]; and accordingly the Tribunal does not

here address it.

(29) The New National Vehicle Registry

On 1 September 2004, the Public Register of Vehicles Act was published in the Official
Gazette, repealing the 1998 Act under which the Concessionaire had operated. This
new legislative framework prohibited the operation of the registry by private entities.
However, Article 3 of this 2004 Act stipulated that all registrations, notices and other
processes completed under the auspices of the former legislation remained fully valid
and applicable. Accordingly, it appears that the Federal Government necessarily took
the view that the adoption and transfer to the new registry of the Concessionaire’s
registrations of new cars (in excess of two million) was administratively appropriate and

posed no threat to national security, whether as an imminent peril or otherwise.

Thus, ten years after the initiative begun in 1994, Mexico was to acquire a national
vehicle registry for both new and used vehicles as originally planned. The difference
between the 1998 Act and this 2004 Act lay in the absence of any private concessionaire
under the latter legislation. It is that essential difference and its reasons which gave rise

to the present dispute between these Parties.

FURTHER FINDINGS OF FACT

The Tribunal has set out above the principal chronology of factual events relevant to
this Award. As already indicated, it will be necessary to return in more detail to specific

aspects of this chronology later below.

This case, as was rightly submitted by Counsel at the main hearing, turns in substantial
part on factual issues. The relevant facts relating to liability, causation and quantum, as
determined by the Tribunal, are somewhat complicated and lengthy to relate, for which

the Tribunal can here make no apology.

PART V: ISSUE A — JURISDICTION

(01) INTRODUCTION

The Respondent challenged the “competence”, or jurisdiction, of the Tribunal under
Article 45 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. The Claimants disputed

such challenge.

The Tribunal has the power to rule on its competence in these arbitration proceedings
under Article 45(1) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. With the Parties’
consent, the Tribunal joined the Respondent’s challenge to the merits of the Parties’
dispute to be decided in this Award under Article 45(5) of the Arbitration (Additional
Facility) Rules.

(02) THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

The Respondent raised two separate objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the
Claimants’ claims pleaded in their Counter-Memorial, within the time-limit required by

Article 45(2) of the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.

Talsud: The first objection concerned the claims advanced by Talsud in these arbitration
proceedings. Later, in its Rejoinder, the Respondent withdrew its objection concerning
Talsud’s “standing” in view of the information contained in the evidential materials

submitted by Talsud with the Claimants’ Reply (Rejoinder, para 128 at 40). This

Part V — Page 1

5-5

5-6

5-7

5-8

information was confirmed by Counsel for Talsud on the first day of the main hearing

and uncontested by the Respondent [D1.69].

The Gemplus Claimants: The Respondent maintained its second objection as regards the
“standing” of the Gemplus Claimants: (i) Gemplus, (ii) SLP and (iii) Gemplus

Industrial.

In summary, the Respondent contends that the continuous chain of ownership and
nationality for their claims was broken with the legal effect, under international law and
the France BIT, that each of these Gemplus Claimants lacks any standing to advance its
claims; and that this Tribunal therefore lacks any jurisdiction, ratione personae, to
decide the merits of any such claims against the Respondent in these arbitration

proceedings.

Gemplus Industrial: The Gemplus Claimants contend that Gemplus Industrial has at all
times been and remains a corporation constituted under the laws of Mexico, which
merged with Gemplus Card International de Mexico SA de C.V. and Grupo Gemplus de
Mexico on 31 October 2003 (the merged company remaining Gemplus Industrial); its
share capital “has at all times been at least 99% owned by a French company” (Request
for Arbitration, paragraph 11); and it is the legal owner of 20% of the issued share

capital of the Concessionaire.

With regard to Gemplus Industrial (also described by the Respondent as “Gemplus

Mexico”), the Respondent submits as follows (Counter-Memorial at 7-8):

“30. Gemplus Mexico subscribed for 20% of the shares in Concesionaria (all
of the Series “C” shares issued by the company).

31. Gemplus Mexico was and remains to the present day a Mexican company.
At the time of the granting of the Concession it was owned by a French
company, Gemplus, S.A.

32. It is trite law that in the absence of clear unambiguous treaty text to the
contrary, a national of a State has no right to initiate an international
claim against its own State.

33. Consistent with customary international law, Gemplus Industrial is not an
“investor from the other Contracting Party” within the meaning of Article

Part V — Page 2

5-9

34,

35,

36.

Gemplus: The Gemplus Claimants submit that Gemplus is a corporation organised
under the laws of France; that it held (until 31 October 2003) 99% of the issued share
capital of Gemplus Card International de Mexico SA de C.V., which in turn held 99%

of the issued share capital of Gemplus Industrial; and that from 31 October 2003 to 27

9, “Settlement of disputes between an investor of one Contracting Party
and the other Contracting Party” of the Mexico-France Treaty.

Article 9 plainly distinguishes between the investor and its investment. In
addition to its title, paragraph I states:

This Article only applies to dis, between one_Contractin,

Party [i.e., Mexico] and an investor of the other Contracting Party
in relation to an alleged breach by the Contracting Party under
this Agreement which causes loss or damage to the investor or his
investment.

This is further underscored by the article’s treatment of the interaction
between local and international proceedings in paragraph 2. Article 9(2)

states:

2.

In relation to submission of a claim to arbitration:

a) An_investor of one of the Contracting Parties may not
allege that the other Contracting Party has breached an obligation
under this Agreement, both in arbitration proceedings in
accordance with this Article and in proceedings before a
competent judicial or administrative tribunal of the former
Contracting Party who is party to the dispute.

b) Also, when a company from one of the Contracting Parties,
which is a legal person owned or controlled by an investor from
the_other Contracting Party, alleges, during the course of
proceedings before a competent judicial or administrative tribunal
of the Contracting Party involved in the proceedings, that the
Contracting Party has breached an obligation under this
Agreement, the investor may not allege the same breach in
arbitration proceedings under this Article.

Article 9 does not permit a national of a State to submit an international

claim against its own State.

[The Respondent's emphasis; footnotes omitted]

April 2004, Gemplus held 99% of the issued share capital of Gemplus Industrial.

Part V — Page 3

5-10

5-11

5-12

5-13

The Respondent contends that Gemplus (described by the Respondent as “Gemplus
France” and also known as “GSA”) has no standing to bring its claims, for the following

reasons (Counter-Memorial at 8-9):

“38. Gemplus France initially had standing to advance this claim because, as a
French national, it owned and controlled Gemplus Mexico [i.e. Gemplus
Industrial]. However, on 22 March 2004, Gemplus France entered into a
Stock Purchase Agreement to sell to a Luxembourgian company, Gemplus
International S.A. (hereinafter “Gemplus Luxembourg”), all or
substantially all the issued and outstanding shares of a number of its
subsidiaries with effect as of I January 2004.

39. The subsidiaries listed in Exhibit A to that Stock Purchase Agreement
included Gemplus Mexico, and therefore, as of 1 January 2004, the
French owner of the Mexican enterprise, which originally held the 20%
shareholding interest in the Concessionaire, transferred it [sic: its] shares
to a Luxembourgian national.

40. With the transfer of the ownership of Gemplus Mexico to a
Luxembourgian company, Gemplus France lost its standing to advance an
international claim in respect of that enterprise’s interest in the
Concessionaire.””

[Footnotes omitted]

The Respondent submits that Gemplus Luxembourg (also known as “GISA”) has no
standing to advance a claim under a treaty between Mexico and France for the obvious
reason that it is a national of Luxembourg (not France); and, indeed, Gemplus
Luxembourg is not named as a claimant party to these arbitration proceedings. It is for
this reason, in the Respondent’s submission, that Gemplus Luxembourg transferred

ownership of Gemplus Industrial back to its French affiliate, SLP.

SLP: The Gemplus Claimants contend that SLP is a corporation organised under French
law; that on 27 April 2004 Gemplus transferred all its shares in Gemplus Industrial to
SLP; and that, accordingly, SLP became and remains the holder of 99% of the issued

share capital of Gemplus Industrial.

The Respondent contends that SLP lacks standing to bring any claim because the chain
of nationality required under the France BIT was severed when Gemplus transferred

ownership in Gemplus Industrial to Gemplus Luxembourg. In the Respondent’s

Part V — Page 4

5-14

submission, SLP’s claim is barred by the principle nemo dat quod non habet, i.e. no one

may transfer better title than he has.

In advancing this argument, the Respondent describes the transfer of ownership in

Gemplus Industrial as follows (Counter-Memorial at 9-11):

“45,

46.

47.

49.

Mr Salgado [of Gemplus] testifies that:

12. On 27 April 2004 Gemplus transferred all its shares in Gemplus
Industrial to SLP. SLP continues to be the holder of more than
99% of the share capital of Gemplus Industrial carrying voting
rights and it controls Gemplus Industrial by virtue of this
shareholdings. I attach charts indicating the changes in the
corporate structure related to Gemplus Industrial from the date of
its incorporation [A19].

The first sentence of this paragraph can easily be misinterpreted. The
reference to “Gemplus” should be understood in the following manner:
Gemplus Luxembourg, which five weeks previously had purchased the
shares of Gemplus Mexico with effect as of 1 January 2004 gave
instructions to the former owner to transfer the shares of Gemplus Mexico
to SLP. By the express terms of the Share Purchase Agreement (see
section II.B.2), with effect as of 1 January 2004, the “Seller hereby
irrevocably sells, conveys and assigns, and Purchaser purchases and
accepts, the issued and outstanding stock of the Transferred
Subsidiaries”, including those of Gemplus Luxembourg, which later
exercised its right under section 7.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement to
“designate an affiliate to whom the Seller shall transfer the Shares with
respect to the applicable Transferred Subsidiary.”

The charts attached to Mr Salgado’s witness statement omit to indicate
that, between 31 October 2003 (Mr Salgado’s fourth chart) and 27 April
2004 (his fifth chart, this being the date of the designation of SLP as the
holder of the shares in Gemplus Mexico), the shares of Gemplus Mexico
were exclusively owned by Gemplus Luxembourg.

This was done by means of an “Acknowledgement” agreement pursuant to
the Share Purchase Agreement with effect “as of April 27, 2004.” In the
Acknowledgement, Gemplus Luxembourg designated an _ affiliate
transferee “for the purchase of the shares of Gemplus Industrial S.A. de
CV.”

An updated confidential Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”)

between Gemplus Luxembourg, Gemplus France, Gemplus Mexico, and
SLP sets out the general terms governing the transfer of Gemplus Mexico

Part V — Page 5

50.

Sl.

52.

53.

to SLP. This MOU is exclusively concerned with the parties’ attempt to
resuscitate the requisite standing to bring the international claim.

SLP, a once operating company that was inactive at the time of the
Acknowledgement, was selected because of its French nationality.
Paragraph 5 of the MOU states:

5. The parties acknowledge that SLP is within the group of
companies affiliated with GISA (the “Gemplus Group”) [“GISA”
is the acronym for Gemplus Luxembourg] and has had significant
operational activities. Those prior operations for the Gemplus
Group ceased in or before the year 2003. SLP remains a suitable
entity to act as a designated transferee for GISA and for the
purposes of receiving and holding the Shares in connection with
the Stock Purchase Agreement and this Memorandum. SLP_ shall
not need any employees for any of the activities it may have as a
designated transferee of the Shares.

 

 

Paragraph 6 then refers to the fact that the present dispute concerning the
Concessionaire arose with Mexico and reflects the agreements by the
parties to the MOU:

To the fullest extent permitted by law, GSA [Gemplus France] and
Gemplus Industrial [Gemplus Mexico] retain all rights they
currently have in relation to the Claims and there shall be no effect
on such rights by virtue of the transfer of the Shares to SLP. SLP
shall provide all assistance and take all necessary action and sign
all documents, including the joining of any legal proceedings, such
as any arbitration, brought in connection with the Claims (“Legal
Proceedings”) and act jointly and cooperate with GSA and
Gemplus Industrial in connection therewith, as may be requested
by GSA and Gemplus Industrial.

The purport of this clause is of no legal effect because Gemplus France
and Gemplus Mexico have no right to the claims (Gemplus Mexico never
had any rights in the first place, and Gemplus France lost its rights in the
claims when it irrevocably conveyed ownership in Gemplus Mexico to
Gemplus Luxembourg). Nor can they eliminate by means of a contract the
international legal effects of the transfer of ownership of Gemplus Mexico
to Gemplus Luxembourg. [...]

 

The MOU also contemplated that SLP might not be effective for the
transactions contemplated thereunder to be fully effective and enforceable
to the satisfaction of the Luxembourgian company. Accordingly, Gemplus
Luxembourg retains the right to revoke the transfer and to designate a
different transferee:

Part V — Page 6

5-15

10. In the event that SLP is unable to complete actions reasonably
necessary for the transactions contemplated hereunder to remain
fully effective and enforceable in manner to_the satisfaction of
GISA, then GISA shall designate a different transferee (includin;
at its election, GISA itself) and the Parties will take all actions
reasonably requested to effectuate the transfer of the Shares to
such alternate transferee so as to have the same economic and the
same effective date as of any previously made or intended transfer.

54. The MOU was executed under the laws of the Grand Duchy of
Luxembourg and the competent courts of that State have sole and
exclusive jurisdiction over any legal proceedings arising thereunder.”

[The Respondent's emphasis; footnotes omitted]

The Respondent further submits, by reference to the language of the France BIT and
international law, that continuous and uninterrupted nationality was not maintained up
to the submission of SLP’s claim to these arbitration proceedings (Counter-Memorial at

11-12):

“S55. Article 9(7) of the Mexico-France BIT requires the Tribunal to resolve this
dispute in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and “applicable
rules and principles of international law”. Those include the rules of
customary international law which continue to apply to relations between
France and Mexico except to the extent that they are varied by treaty.

56. One such rule of customary international law is the principle of
“continuous nationality”, described by Oppenheim’s as follows:

It may accordingly be stated as a general principle that from the
time of the occurrence of the injury until the making of the award
the_claim_must i ly _and_ without interruption have
belonged to a person or a series of persons (a) having the

i lity of the state by whom it is put forward, and (b) not
having the nationality of the state against whom is [sic: it is] put
forward.

57. Brownlie cites this passage with approval. He notes that some argue that
the rule does not require continuous nationality from the injury up to the
date of the award (the dies ad quem). Brownlie comments:

The first part of the rule of continuity does not give rise to much
difficulty: the relevant nationality must exist at the time of injury.

The second part of the rule is variously stated in terms of

Part V — Page 7

5-16

58.

59.

60.

6l.

The Respondent concluded its written submissions with a lengthy passage from the
NAFTA award in The Loewen Group of Companies v. United States. The tribunal there
decided that a change in the nationality of the claimant corporation, by virtue of a

corporate reorganization midway through the arbitration, was fatal to that claim as a

nationality continuing until the ‘presentation of the award’, or the
filing of a claim before a tribunal, or the formal presentation of the
diplomatic claim in the absence of submission to a tribunal.
However, the majority of governments and of writers take the date
of the award or judgment as the critical date.

Regardless of where the dies ad quem falls between date of presentation
and date of the award, there is consensus that continuous and
uninterrupted nationality must exist at a minimum until the presentation of
the claim or its submission to arbitration. In this case the claim was
submitted to arbitration on 10 August 2004, after ownership was
transferred to Gemplus Luxembourg.

With respect to the assignment of claims, Brownlie notes:
If during the critical period a claim is assigned to or by a non-
national of the claimant state, the claim must be denied. However,
assignment does not affect the claim if the principle of continuity is
observed.

Oppenheim’s agrees:

In cases... of assignment, a claim will normally be allowed if the
continuity of nationality is maintained and disallowed if it is not.

 

In this case, continuity of nationality was not maintained in the critical
period. With the transfer of ownership of Gemplus Mexico, the claim
passed from a French company to a Luxembourgian company and then
back to another French company (and even then only conditionally). In
short, to use Brownlie’s terms, the continuous nationality rule is triply
offended because the claim has been assigned to a non-national and by a
non-national of France and it remains susceptible to being further
reassigned by that non-national.”

matter of jurisdiction under Chapter 11 of NAFTA (Counter-Memorial at 13-14).

Part V — Page 8

(03) THE GEMPLUS CLAIMANTS’ CASE

5-17 Gemplus Industrial: The Gemplus Claimants contend that the Respondent’s

submissions with regard to the standing of Gemplus Industrial to bring its claim are

flawed in several material respects.

5-18 | The Gemplus Claimants take issue with the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 9 of

the France BIT (Reply at 15-17):

“35. To begin with, it is submitted by the Gemplus Claimants that Article 9
must be read as being subject to the definition of “Investor” in Article 1.
The heading of Article 9 reads as follows:

‘Resolution of disputes between an Investor from one of the
Contracting Parties and the other Contracting Party.’

36. The reference to “Investor” in this heading requires reference to be made
to the definition in Article 1. Article 9 must be read by reference to Article
1, which defines this word. A failure to do so would otherwise leave the
term “Investor” bereft of a definition.

37. By Article 1(2)(b) of the BIT an “Investor” includes:

‘any moral entity constituted in the territory of one of the
Contracting States in accordance with the laws of that country and
with its registered office in that country, or directly or indirectly
controlled by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties, or by
moral entities which have a registered office within the territory of
one of the Contracting Parties and are constituted in accordance
with the laws of that country. A moral entity is deemed to be
controlled if the majority of its issued shares carrying voting rights
is held by a national or a moral entity which has its registered
office within the territory of a Contracting Party and is constituted
in accordance with the laws of that Contracting Party.’

38. Gemplus Mexico [i.e. Gemplus Industrial] is, for the purposes of this
definition, a moral entity directly or indirectly controlled by moral entities
which have their registered office within the territory of one of the
Contracting Parties (namely Gemplus, S.A. and/or SLP) and are
constituted in accordance with the laws of that Contracting Party. It is
deemed to be controlled as provided in the last sentence of that Article
9(2)(b) because the majority of its issued shares carrying voting rights is

Part V — Page 9

5-19

5-20

5-21

39.

The Gemplus Claimants submit that there is no issue between the Parties as to the
ownership and control by Gemplus of Gemplus Industrial up to 1 January 2004. Thus,
the Claimants contend that, “[s]ubject to the nationality of the controller being a French
company, Gemplus Mexico is a company owned or controlled by a Contracting Party

other than the Respondent and is therefore an investor for the purpose of Article 1,

held by a moral entity which has its registered office within the territory of
a Contracting State (France) and is constituted in accordance with the
laws of that Contracting State (France).

This provision permits the nationality of an investor to be identified by the
Contracting State in which its controllers have their registered office and
are constituted. Applied to a claim by a French company, the definition
extends to a company constituted and with its registered office in France
or to a company directly or indirectly controlled by one or more
companies having their registered office in and constituted in France.”

paragraph 2(b) of the [France] BIT” (Reply at 17).

Gemplus: The Gemplus Claimants similarly dispute the Respondent’s allegation that
Gemplus has no standing to bring its claim. The Claimants submit that the relevant
issue is not whether Gemplus sold its shares under the Stock Purchase Agreement

(“SPA”), but rather whether that sale affected its right to bring its present claims under

the France BIT.

The Gemplus Claimants set out their submissions as follows (Reply at 19-20):

The primary contention of the Gemplus Claimants is that Gemplus France
retained its rights to the claims in this arbitration, notwithstanding the
SPA. This is because Gemplus Mexico and Gemplus France entered into
a Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”), to which Gemplus
Luxembourg is also a party, which contains the following provision:

‘7. The Parties acknowledge that prior to the transfer of the Shares in
connection herewith, there arose a dispute with the Government of
the United States of Mexico concerning Concesionaria Renave S.A.
de C.V. (“Renave”). Renave was incorporated as a consequence
of the granting by the Mexican government to Gemplus Industrial
and its partners of the concession title to manage and operate the
National Vehicle Registry of Mexico and which was subject to a
series of confiscatory actions in the years 2000 through 2002, all
of which have given rise to claims regarding such actions (the

Part V — Page 10

48.

“Claims”). To the full extent permitted by law, GSA [Gemplus
France] and Gemplus Industrial [Gemplus Mexico] retain all
rights they currently have in relation to the Claims and there shall
be no effect on such rights by virtue of the transfer of the Shares to
SLP. SLP shall provide all assistance and take all necessary
action and sign all documents, including the joining of any legal
proceedings, such as any arbitration, brought in connection with
the Claims (“Legal Proceedings”) and act jointly and co-operate
with GSA and Gemplus Industrial in connection therewith, as may
be requested by GSA and Gemplus Industrial.’

 

It is the Claimants’ case that the impact of this provision could not be
clearer: the shares were transferred by Gemplus France, but the right to
bring this claim was not.

The response of the Respondent is that this clause has no legal effect for
three reasons:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

Gemplus Mexico has no rights in the first place. This is wrong for
the reasons given above.

Gemplus France lost its rights when it transferred the shares under
the SPA. Leaving aside the identity and nationality of the
transferee, this assertion is self-serving: it ignores the provision on
which the Gemplus Claimants rely. The SPA must be read together
with the Acknowledgment and the MOU to obtain an
understanding of what the parties did and intended: the shares
were transferred but the rights in relation to the claims in this
arbitration were expressly retained by Gemplus France, “to the
fullest extent permitted by law”. No reasons are advanced by the
Respondent to explain why effect should not be given to the plainly
expressed intentions of the parties to the MOU; and

The Gemplus companies cannot “eliminate by means of a contract
the international legal effects of the transfer of ownership of
Gemplus Mexico [...]”.. No attempt is made to define
“international legal effects” or to explain how or why these should
inhibit the parties in defining what rights in addition to the shares
are transferred or retained. It is accepted by the Gemplus
Claimants that the transfer of shares to a non-French company
would not give any rights to the transferee to make a claim under
the Mexico-France BIT. But there is no reason why a French
transferor should not retain the right to pursue claims which it is
acknowledged by the Respondent were validly held by it up to the
date of the transfer.”

In the alternative, contrary to their primary case, the Gemplus Claimants submit that
should the Tribunal determine that Gemplus has not retained the right to pursue its
claims under the France BIT, the Tribunal must necessarily find that such right is now

held by SLP.

SLP: With regard to the Respondent’s argument that the transfer of shares by Gemplus
in Gemplus Industrial to Gemplus Luxembourg and then on to SLP severed the chain of
nationality required under the France BIT and international law, the Gemplus Claimants
contend that such a conclusion may only be reached on a “highly selective reading of
the SPA and Acknowledgement”. The Claimants submit that these documents instead

support a different conclusion (Reply at 21-22):

“31. ... These documents make it clear that:

(i) The transfer of shares under the SPA is expressly made “Subject to
the Terms of this Agreement” (Clause 1.1);

(ii) | The SPA is intended as a “framework agreement” and is subject to
“Additional Agreements” as defined in Clause 7.1 (third recital);

(iti) The Additional Agreement provides for the designation of an
affiliate to whom Gemplus France shall transfer shares in
Gemplus Mexico instead of Gemplus Luxembourg;

(iv) — Such designation was done by the Acknowledgment, whereby SLP
is identified as the Transferee;

(v) Gemplus France as seller represents and warrants that it is the
lawful owner of the shares on the Closing Date (Clause 3.5);

(vi) — The Closing Date is “as the Parties may agree” (Clause 2.1). By
the terms of the Acknowledgment, that date is 27 April 2004. This
is confirmed in the MOU (Clause 12); and

(vii) The governing law of the SPA is that of Luxembourg.”

The Gemplus Claimants rely upon the expert opinions of Mr Kinsch and Mr José
Antonio Chavez Vargas in regard to the legal effects produced by the transfer of
ownership in Gemplus Industrial under the SPA, Acknowledgement and MOU under

the laws of Luxembourg and Mexico respectively (Reply at 22):

Part V — Page 12

“52.

53.

54.

The Gemplus Claimants refer to and rely on the opinion of Mr Patrick
Kinsch, a member of the Luxembourg bar and Adjunct Professor of Law at
the University of Luxembourg. His view is that:

“[...] In order to decide that property has passed to a specific
party, the Arbitral Tribunal would have to find both that (i) under
Luxembourg law as the law applicable to the contract, property
was intended to pass, and that (ii) under Mexican law as the lex
situs such steps as may be necessary to effectuate the passing of
title in the shares have been taken. The property will have passed
only after the requirements of both laws have been satisfied.”

Having considered the general rules of Luxembourg law on the transfer of
ownership by contract of sale and the wording of the SPA, the
Acknowledgment and the MOU, Professor Kinsch reaches the following
conclusion:

“It follows from the Stock Purchase Agreement and from the
Acknowledgment that the description, given in the Memorandum of
Understanding and in Mr Salgado’s witness statement, of the
transfer of ownership in the shares in Gemplus Industrial, as
having taken place not between Gemplus and Gemplus
International, but between Gemplus and SLP, is entirely in line
with Mexican law. In fact, under Luxembourg law the theory of
the Counter-Memorial, according to which there has been, by
virtue of the signing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, an
immediate passing of ownership of the shares of Gemplus to
Gemplus International, is contrary to the parties’ clearly
expressed intention and therefore also contrary to Luxembourg
law.”

To the extent that the position under Mexican law may be relevant to this
question, the Gemplus Claimants refer to and rely on the opinion of Mr
José Antonio Chavez Vargas, an experienced Mexican business lawyer
and partner in the Mexico City office of Thacher Proffitt & Wood, S.C.
Mr Chdvez, having examined the Gemplus Industrial share certificates
and share register, expresses his conclusion as follows:

“41. The share certificates, endorsements and other means
employed to implement the stock transfer, as well as the structure
used for the transaction and the intention of the parties expressed
in the Agreement, the Acknowledgment and MOU, all point clearly
to the conclusion that the shares in Gemplus Industrial were
transferred directly to and are held by SLP (with the exception of
the three shares transferred to Gemplus Finance, S.A.) and that no
shares in Gemplus Industrial were transferred to Gemplus
International at any time.”

Part V — Page 13

5-25

[Footnote omitted]

The Gemplus Claimants invited the Tribunal to accept the conclusions of these
independent legal experts and to conclude that the shares in Gemplus Industrial were
transferred not to Gemplus Luxembourg but to SLP and that, therefore, the continuous
chain of ownership and nationality of the claim has not been broken under the France

BIT or international law.

(04) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

5-26

5-27

5-28

Talsud: Given the Respondent’s revised and final position as regards Talsud, it is not
here necessary for the Tribunal to address the Respondent’s original challenge to
Talsud’s claims, save to confirm and record that the Tribunal decides to assume
jurisdiction over all Talsud’s claims against the Respondent, having competence to do

so.

The Gemplus Claimants: As to the Gemplus Claimants, it is convenient to consider their

three respective positions in turn.

SLP: The expert evidence of Mr Kinsch on Luxembourg law and Mr Chavez on
Mexican law was not contraverted by any expert evidence or equivalent submissions by
the Respondent. In any event, the Tribunal is persuaded by these experts’ legal opinions
as to the effect of the SPA, the MOU and related documentation, together with their
express terms. As interpreted under these respective laws, as the SPA’s applicable law
and as the /ex situs, the Tribunal concludes that the SPA, the MOU and related
documentation transferred the shares in Gemplus Industrial (Gemplus Mexico) to SLP
and not to Gemplus International (Gemplus Luxembourg). This transfer did not thereby
break the ‘national chain of ownership’ under the France BIT, as invoked by the

Respondent.

Part V — Page 14

5-29

5-30

5-31

5-32

However, as determined below, SLP never acquired the right to bring claims against the
Respondent relating to the present dispute: that right remained with Gemplus.
Accordingly, SLP can have no claims against the Respondent under Article 9 of the
France BIT. Whilst the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide SLP’s pleaded claims in these

arbitration proceedings, such claims must fail in limine on the Claimant’s primary case

Gemplus Industrial: It is common ground between the Parties that Gemplus Industrial
(Gemplus Mexico) owns 20% of the shareholding in the Concessionaire, that Gemplus
Industrial was and remains a legal person, constituted in Mexico in accordance with the
laws of Mexico and with its registered office in Mexico. It is not disputed that at
different times Gemplus and SLP, directly or indirectly, controlled Gemplus Industrial;
and that both Gemplus and SLP were and remain legal persons, constituted in France in

accordance with French law and with their registered offices in France.

On these facts, the Tribunal considers that Gemplus Industrial is an “Investor” within
the definition provided by Article 1(2)(b) of the France BIT Article 1.2.b) of the France
BIT (Albeit somewhat differently translated from the text cited above from the
Claimants’ submissions, the BIT provided: “The term ‘investor’ means: (b) any legal
person organized in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with the
laws of that Contracting Party and having its seat in the territory of that Party, or
directly or indirectly controlled by nationals of one of the Contracting Parties, or by
legal persons which have their seat within the territory of one of the Contracting Parties
and are organized in accordance with the laws of that Contracting Party. A legal person
is deemed to be controlled if the majority of its issued shares carrying voting rights is
held by a national or a legal person which has its seat within the territory of a
Contracting Party and is organized in accordance with the laws of that Contracting

Party”).

However, as a Mexican legal person, Gemplus Industrial is not an investor “from the
other Contracting State” in a dispute with the Respondent under Article 9(1) of the
France BIT. It provides specifically: “This article applies only to disputes between one

Contracting Party and investors from the other Contracting Party ....” [emphasis

Part V — Page 15

5-33

added]. Accordingly, Gemplus Industrial cannot advance its own claims against the
Respondent under Article 9 of the France BIT; and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to

decide any of its own claims pleaded in these arbitration proceedings.

Gemplus: Gemplus (Gemplus France) transferred its shares in Gemplus Industrial under
the SPA and related documentation, subject to the MOU. The legal effect of the MOU,
as those contracting parties manifestly intended, was such that Gemplus retained all
rights to maintain its existing claims as advanced in these proceedings against the
Respondent under Article 9 of the France BIT. The MOU’s express qualification “to the
full extent permitted by law” was met in this case under the applicable laws of
Luxembourg and Mexico, as presented to the Tribunal by Mr Kinsch and Mr Chavez

and not challenged by the Respondent.

(05) THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

5-34

5-35

In conclusion, for the above reasons, the Tribunal decides to assume jurisdiction over all
the claims advanced against the Respondent by Gemplus (i.e. Gemplus S.A., the First
Claimant in ICSID No ARB(AF)/04/03), having competence to do so, as with all
Talsud’s pleaded claims in ICSID Arb (AF)/04/04; the Tribunal decides that it has no
jurisdiction in regards to any claims pleaded by Gemplus Industrial (i.e. Gemplus
Industrial S.A. de C.V.); and, whilst the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims
pleaded by SLP (i.e. SLP S.A.), the latter’s claims must fail in limine on the primary

case advanced by the Gemplus Claimants themselves, including, of course, SLP itself.

Accordingly, from henceforth in this Award when considering the merits of the several
claims brought by the Claimants against the Respondent in these arbitration

proceedings, the term “Claimants” refers only to Gemplus and Talsud.

PART VI: ISSUE B — LIABILITY: GENERAL APPROACH

(01) INTRODUCTION

This case is factually and legally complicated, as already noted earlier in this Award.
Although the Tribunal here seeks to separate out and decide the individual issues raised
by the Claimants’ substantive claims and the Respondent’s substantive defences, it is

helpful first to set out the general approach taken to the merits of this case, and disputed,

by the Claimants and the Respondent respectively.

General Approach: The Claimants preface their substantive arguments with the

THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

following general comments (Memorial at 91-92):

these claims on the basis that it is distinct and free-standing, so that the
establishment of one is in no case dependent upon the establishment of
another.

 

Second, the Claimants recognise that the obligations in the two BITs upon
which they rely are not necessarily identical in the way in which they have
been drafted. The Claimants submit that it is appropriate to proceed on
the basis that there is no material difference between the legal obligation

 

Part VI — Page 1

6-3

271.

272.

The Tribunal notes the Claimants’ statement in Paragraph 272 (last cited above) that no
issue arises from their Claims regarding the Respondent’s responsibility for “provincial

or other levels of government”, e.g. thereby excluding the Respondent’s state

imposed by the two sets of provisions. Where there is such difference the
Claimants will spell them out.

Third, it is appropriate to make the general factual point that Mexico
failed to fulfill its obligations under the Concession Agreement and —
distinctly — it failed to fulfil its obligations under the BITs. Although these
two sets of failure exist in relationship to each other, the violation of the
obligations under the BITs is not dependent upon finding any violation of
the Concession Agreement or relevant parts of Mexican law. Having
granted the Concession Agreement and permitted the Concessionaire to
operate, Mexico failed, through the Secretariat or otherwise, to establish
the cooperation arrangements that were essential to the effective
operation of the venture, and it failed, through the Ministry of Security, to
provide information required by the Concessionaire to verify data
received on used vehicles. It also proceeded to take a number of measures
that were intended to have — and did have — the effect of frustrating the
venture and bringing it to an early conclusion. Initially, these measures
constituted the arbitrary and unfair intervention in the operations of the
Concessionaire and the curtailment of the shareholders’ powers of
management, in particular through the Technical Intervention and the
Administrative Intervention, as well as the failure to promulgate the Rules
of Operation in a timely manner. Subsequently, the measures led to the
Seizure of the Concessionaire, the Revocation of the Concession
Agreement and the expropriation and unlawful interference with the
investors’ assets, including their rights in relation to the Concession
Agreement. At no time did Mexico offer due and fair compensation.

There can be no question but that each and every one of these measures is
directly attributable to Mexico, acting through the Secretariat, and
engages its responsibility in respect of the obligations arising under the
BITs. Each and every one of the acts and omissions complained of were
those of federal Mexican government ministries and authorities including,
in the case of the seizure of the Registry, measures taken with the
assistance of the Mexican Federal Police which took control of access to
and from the Concessionaire’s premises. There is no issue in these
proceedings about the responsibility of provincial or other levels of
government.”

responsibility for any acts of the Government of the Federal District of Mexico.

Part VI— Page 2

The Claimants contend that they have satisfied all of the requirements for bringing these
arbitration proceedings. They assert that any proceedings brought before the Mexican
courts have been brought by the Concessionaire, as a “juridically distinct person”,
relating to alleged violations of Mexican national law and the Concession Agreement as
opposed to violations of the BITs. In this regard, the Claimants submit the following

(Memorial at 82-83):

“246. Talsud has not submitted the present dispute (concerning violations of
treaty obligations) against Mexico on behalf of the Concessionaire or any
other Party nor has it instituted proceedings before any administrative or
judicial court. Such administrative and judicial actions as have been filed
in Mexican courts have been brought by the Concessionaire, a juridically
distinct entity from Talsud (and the other Claimants), and they relate to
disputes arising only under Mexican law and not in relation to the
Argentina BIT. Talsud does not control the Concessionaire and the
proceedings brought by the Concessionaire do not — and cannot — affect
the international law cause of action that is the basis of Talsud’s dispute
with Mexico in relation to its investment. Accordingly, neither Article
10.3 of the Argentina BIT nor Article 1.4 of the Appendix can have the
effect of precluding these proceedings.

[ou]

248. The Gemplus companies have not brought any action against Mexico
before any administrative or judicial court and have not raised any claim
alleging breach of treaty before such courts. As indicated above, the
administrative and judicial actions which have been filed in Mexico
concerning the Concession Agreement have been brought by the
Concessionaire, a juridically distinct entity from the Claimants, and they
do not give rise to or affect the treaty claims and the international law
causes of action that are the subject of these claims and disputes.
Moreover, the Gemplus companies do not control the Concessionaire.

249. As described above [...], the Concessionaire has brought several judicial
actions against the Government of Mexico before various Mexican courts.
At no point in any of these proceedings have the provisions of either one of
the BITs been invoked by the Concessionaire, and they could not be
invoked. The purpose of the judicial actions brought by the
Concessionaire is fundamentally different from the purpose of these
arbitration proceedings. It is the Claimants’ status as investors under the
BITs that allows them to bring these arbitration proceedings, and any
success they may have would bring benefits that will be limited by the
terms of the BITs to them. Together, Talsud and the Gemplus companies
do not control the Concessionaire.”

 

Part VI — Page 3

Treaty v Contract Claims: The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s characterization of
their claims in these proceedings as “an international claim [...] based on a contractual
relationship between investors and the State”, contending rather that their case “is based
on Mexico’s violations of various provisions of the two BITs” under international law

(Reply at 100, Counter-Memorial at 16).

As regards the relationship under international law between treaty and contract claims,
the Claimants cite the now well-known passage from the ICSID Annulment Ad Hoc
Committee in Compaitia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine

Republic (Memorial, para. 243 at 81):

“95. As to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty in the
present case, it must be stressed that Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not
relate directly to breach of a_municipal contra Rather they set an
independent standard. A_state may breach a treaty without breaching a
contract, and vice versa, and this is certainly true of these provisions of
the BIT. The point is made clear in Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which is
entitled “Characterization of an act of a State as internationally
wrongful”: The characterization of an act of a State as internationally
wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not
affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.

 

   

 

96. In accordance with this general principle (which is undoubtedly
declaratory of general international law), whether _there_has_been_a
breach of the BIT and whether there has been_a breach of contract are
different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference
to its own proper or applicable law — in the case of the BIT, by
international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper
law of the contract, in other words, the law of Tucumdn. For example, in
the case of a claim based on a treaty, international law rules of attribution
apply, with the result that the state of Argentina is internationally
responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities. By contrast, the state
of Argentina is not liable for the performance of contracts entered into by
Tucumdn, which possesses separate legal personality under its own law
and is responsible for the performance of its own contracts.”

 

[The Claimants’ emphasis; footnotes omitted]

Part VI— Page 4

However, although the Claimants contend that their claims are only treaty-based on the
France and Argentina BITs, the Claimants also contend that the Tribunal should take
into account the underlying factual circumstances of their claims, including the

contractual relationship between the Concessionaire and Mexico (Reply at 100-01):

“237. The relationship between treaty claims and contract claims has been
addressed recently by the Tribunal in Azurix v Argentina, in a way that
usefully brings together the authorities:

‘SI. The Tribunal recalls that its decision on jurisdiction is based on
the finding that the claimant had shown a prima facie claim
against the respondent for breach of obligations owed by
Argentina to the claimant under the BIT. In that decision, the
Tribunal noted that: “The investment dispute which the claimant
has put before this Tribunal invokes obligations owed by the
respondent to the claimant under the BIT and it is based on a
different cause of action from a claim under the Contract
Documents. Even if the dispute as presented by the claimant may
involve the interpretation or analysis of facts related to
performance under the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal
considers that, to the extent that such issues are relevant to a
breach of the obligations of the respondent under the BIT, they
cannot per se transform the dispute under the BIT into a
contractual dispute” (Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 76).

[ou]

54. As noted earlier, Argentina has questioned the ability of a claimant
to invoke as events or facts giving rise to international
responsibility the same facts that constitute a breach of contract.
The Tribunal has no doubt that the same events may give rise to
claims under a contract or a treaty, “even if these two claims
would coincide they would remain analytically distinct, and
necessarily require different enquiries.” (Ibid., para. 258.) To
evoke the language of the Annulment Committee in Vivendi II, the
Tribunal is faced with a claim that is not “simply reducible to so
many civil or administrative law claims concerning so many
individual acts alleged to violate the Concession Contract or the
administrative law of Argentina”, but with a claim that “these acts
taken together, or some of them, amounted to a breach” of the BIT.
(Decision of Annulment Committee, para. 112) This is the nature
of the claim in respect of which the Tribunal held that it had
jurisdiction and which the Tribunal is obliged to consider and
decide.’

Part VI— Page 5

6-8

6-9

238. The Tribunal must take into account the underlying factual circumstances,
which include the contractual relationship between the Concessionaire
and the Secretariat, and ascertain the extent to which the State has
exercised the specific functions of a sovereign. The Claimants respectfully
submit that the correct approach is that set forth by the Annulment
Committee in CAA and Vivendi v Argentina:

‘it is one thing to exercise contractual jurisdiction ... and another
to take into account the terms of a contract in determining whether
there has been a breach of a distinct standard of international law,
such as that reflected in [a provision of a] BIT.’

239. To the extent that the Claimants refer to the concession agreement they
do no more than invite the Tribunal to take into account its terms for the
purpose of determining whether the sovereign acts and omissions for
which the Respondent is responsible — commencing with the failure to
secure cooperation agreements with the federative entities and the
consequent unilateral decision to extend the deadline for the registration
of used cars — gives rise to violations of the two BITs. The Respondent
appears to accept this in inviting the Tribunal “to have due regard to the

factual background”.
[Footnotes omitted]

Deference: The Claimants characterize the Respondent’s approach on the matter of
deference owed by this Tribunal to governmental decisions of the Respondent as
“misconceived”. In their submission, the only deference which might be permitted (if
any) is “in relation to alternative courses of action which are justifiable under
international law on the grounds that any government might have acted that way.”
(Post-Hearing Brief at 6-7). In this case, however, the Claimants submit that the actions
leading to the Requisition and Revocation were not measures that “a reasonable and
prudent Government would have taken, and cannot justify any degree of deference.”

(Post-Hearing Brief at 7).

The Claimants contend, in regard to the standard of deference articulated by the tribunal
in S.D. Myers, that this tribunal ultimately chose not to make deference in that case;
and, on the facts of the case, that it found a violation of the treaty, notwithstanding the

availability of local and other remedies (Post-Hearing Brief at 8).

Part VI— Page 6

6-10 Standard of Proof. Finally, the Claimants contend that the standard of proof to which
the Claimants should be held in making out their claims is set out in the two BITs and

not elsewhere (Reply at 103-04):

“242. The Respondent asserts that proving a breach of treaty carries a heavier
burden of proof than proving breach of contract, and that tribunals
consistently posit a high threshold for finding a denial of fair and
equitable treatment. Neither assertion assists the Respondent. The
standard to be applied by this Tribunal is that set forth in the BITs. The
question of whether or not there has been a breach of contract — and the
determination of the standard applicable under the governing Mexican
law for that issue — is not a matter for this Tribunal. The standard to be
applied in determining a violation of a BIT is a point to which the
Claimants return below. For the purposes of identifying a general
approach the determination of whether there is a high or low threshold for
any particular claim is of little utility. The standard is that set forth by the
two BITs in these cases, and is to be applied to the facts of each case.
Belatedly, the Claimants do not seek any determination by the Tribunal
that Mexico has breached its own law; the question of whether or not an
unlawful act at municipal law can automatically amount to a breach of
treaty is not an issue in these proceedings.”

[Footnotes omitted]

(03) THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

6-11 General Approach: The Respondent also prefaces its written and oral submissions with
several preliminary points intended to provide the Tribunal with a framework for its
subsequent analysis of the relevant factual and legal issues. The Respondent contends
that the claims presented by the Claimants are repetitive and, therefore, “if Mexico has a
full answer to why a measure cannot give rise to an expropriation, the defence is likely
to be the same or substantially the same to a claimed denial of fair and equitable

treatment” (Rejoinder at 41).

Part VI— Page 7

6-12

6-13

The Respondent asserts that these arbitration proceedings are strictly international law
proceedings under the two BITS and, therefore, that the Tribunal has no mandate over
any contractual claims against the Respondent. In this regard, the Respondent submits

the following (Counter-Memorial at 16-17):

“77. The tribunal in the case of Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican
States confirmed this in respect of the NAFTA, which contains a similarly
worded governing law clause to those of the two Treaties. That Tribunal
noted:

73. The Tribunal begins by observing that —unlike many bilateral and
regional investment treaties - NAFTA Chapter I1 does not give
jurisdiction in respect of breaches of investment contracts such as
the Concession Agreement. Nor does it contain an “umbrella
clause” committing the host State to comply with its contractual
commitments. This does not mean that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction to take note of or interpret the contract. But such
jurisdiction is incidental in character, and it is always necessary
for a claimant to assert as its cause of action a claim founded in
one of the substantive provisions of NAFTA referred to in Articles
1116 and 1117. Furthermore, while conduct (e.g. an
expropriation) may at the same time involve a breach of NAFTA
standards and a breach of contract, the two categories are distinct.
Even as to Article 1105, while it will be relevant to show that
particular conduct of the host State contradicted agreements or
understandings reached at the time of the entry of the investment, it
is still necessary to prove that this conduct was a breach of the
substantive standards embodied in Article 1105. Showing that it
was a breach of contract is not enough.”

[Footnotes omitted]

Treaty v Contract Claims: The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ claims, as
advanced in these proceedings, are in fact “contract claims” subject to the jurisdiction of
the Mexican courts and not treaty claims under the BITs at all (Counter-Memorial at
135-37). The Respondent develops this submission in its Rejoinder, where it further
characterizes the Claimants’ claims as “derivative, in law and in fact” (Rejoinder, para.

137 at 42).

Part VI— Page 8

6-14 The Respondent contends that (Rejoinder at 44):

“144. [c]ontrary to the [Claimants’] Reply’s assertion that the domestic legal
proceedings before the Mexican courts were initiated by the majority
shareholder (Mr. Davis’s group) alone, the evidence demonstrates that
after the Secretariat intervened, approvals were given at both the
shareholder and the Board levels to analyze the possibility of bringing
legal challenges against SECOFI and to pursue such challenges.

145. No evidence has been adduced by the Claimants in support of the
contention that the various legal proceedings were initiated by Mr. Davis
alone. Nor has it been demonstrated that at any point after the various
lawsuits were initiated, the Claimants exercised their powers as
shareholders or as directors at any time to disavow such actions.”

[Footnotes omitted]

6-15 The Respondent also submits that the majority of the acts complained of involve the

exercise of a contractual right by the Secretariat (Rejoinder at 45-46):

“148. The Reply avoids addressing the argument about the exercise of the
Secretariat's rights, and in various parts characterizes the Secretariat’s
acts as “sovereign,” the implication being that the Secretariat somehow
acted in a sovereign capacity external to the contract’s applicable legal
framework, rather than within that legal framework.

149. Each of the acts complained of, with the exception of the inability to
compel the execution of coordination agreements with the 32 federative
entities, was: (i) expressly contemplated by the Title of Concession, (ii) by
the legal framework expressly incorporated therein, or (iii) by both. It
does not assist the Claimants to characterize the Secretariat's rights of
audit, inspection, intervention, termination, requisition, and revocation, to
which the Claimant’s consortium agreed, as “sovereign”. With the
exception of the inability to conclude coordination agreements, all of the
acts complained of involved a claim of legal right by the Secretariat based
on either the Title of Concession, its legal framework, or both. As the
Azinian and Waste Management tribunals recognized, the form of a State
entity’s repudiation of a contract affects how it is subsequently analyzed
by an international tribunal. In Azinian, for example, the repudiation by
the municipal council took the form of the rescission of the contract for
cause, which cause was later upheld by the local courts. In the instant
case the Secretariat did likewise, after reaching the conclusion (upheld by
the Mexican courts) that the circumstances precluded the Concessionaire
from providing the public service in an optimal fashion, the Secretariat
intervened. It then informed the Concessionaire that it was considering
revocation, it initiated an administrative proceeding permitting the

 

Part VI — Page 9

Concessionaire to make its arguments in its defence and giving it the
complete file for its review, then moved to revoke the concession and
submitted to the court's jurisdiction in order to respond to the
Concessionaire’s revocation nullity proceeding.

150. The Claimants’ strategy appears to focus on the Secretariat's acts as if the
contract's legal framework applies exclusively to the Concessionaire, but
not to them, even though all their complaints are based on alleged injury
to Renave and [the Claimants’] representatives managed the company at
the relevant time. They thus seek to avoid the Counter-Memorial’s point
that when the Secretariat, as a contracting party, exercised powers
reserved to it by the Title of Concession, such exercise cannot be said to
have fallen outside the legitimate expectations of the company and its
investors.

151. It is trite law that contracting parties can disagree over a party’s exercise
of a right held by it (or even as to the existence of the claimed right itself).
In such circumstances, the other party can challenge the exercise of the
claimed right by submitting the dispute to the agreed forum. In this case,
the possibility that disputes over the exercise of either party’s contractual
rights could arise, even in the extraordinary and unforeseeable events that
ultimately befell the National Vehicle Registry, was not outside the
contracting parties’ expectations. The fact that the exercise of such rights
has been challenged (and is being contested in the proper forum, to which
access has been freely obtained, and to which the Secretariat has duly
submitted), is of critical importance to these international claims in this
proceeding.”

6-16  Deference: In any event, the Respondent further asserts that the Tribunal must have
“due deference” to governmental decisions, drawing again in particular on the standard

of deference enunciated by the tribunal in S.D. Myers (Counter-Memorial at 17-18):

“When interpreting and applying the ‘minimum standard’ a Chapter 11
tribunal does not have an open-ended mandate to second-guess
government decision-making. Governments have to make many
potentially controversial choices. In doing so, they may appear to have
made mistakes, to have misjudged facts, proceeded on the basis of
misguided economic or sociological theory, placed too much emphasis on
some social values over others and adopted solutions that are ultimately
ineffective or counterproductive. The ordinary remedy, if there were one,
for errors in modern governments is through internal political and legal
processes...”

[Footnotes omitted]

Part VI— Page 10

6-17 In its closing submissions during the main hearing, Counsel the Respondent

summarized its position on ‘deference’ as follows [D8:1805-06]:

“The first basic principle, of course is that an international tribunal must
grant a measure of deference to the governmental decision-making
process, and it cannot substitute its judgment for that of the competent
authorities.

Now, this was a point that was made in S.D. Myers against Canada at
paragraph 261 of the first Partial Award, and I will just read you the key
passage from that Award. The Tribunal said that a government, ‘may
appear to have made mistakes, to have misjudged the facts, proceeded on
the basis of a misguided economic or sociological theory, placed too much
emphasis on some social values over others, and accepted solutions that
are ultimately ineffective or counterproductive.’

The Tribunal goes on to say that the normal recourse in such
circumstances is through, ‘internal political and legal processes,
including elections.’

Now, this page from S.D. Myers has had some traction with subsequent
tribunals. It was cited by Saluka, I think Mr. Fortier remembers this, at
paragraph 284, and it was cited with approval by GAMI Investments,
which is another Tribunal chaired by Mr. Paulson.”

6-18 Standard of Proof: The Respondent also contends that the Claimants face a heavier
burden of proof in establishing their claims for the breach of the BITs than is normally

the case in proving a claim for breach of contract (Counter-Memorial at 18):

“84. The Tribunal in the Impregilo case recently noted that when an
international claim involves alleged breaches of a state contract, “[t]he
threshold to establish that a breach of ... [a contract] constitutes a breach
of the Treaty is a high one.” This is consistent with the conclusions
reached in the Vivendi case, where the Annulment Committee concluded
that, in conformity with the applicable treaty, the Claimants could pursue
a treaty claim with “its associated burden of proof” (as opposed to a
contract claim in the local courts) and in doing so they took the “risk of a
tribunal holding that the acts complained of neither individually nor
collectively rose to the level of a breach” of the BIT. The arbitral award in
Waste Management is to the same effect.”

6-19 In regard to proving a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standards under the

BITs, the Respondent states that “the Tribunal must be persuaded that the State’s

Part VI — Page 11

conduct is manifestly arbitrary or unfair,” submitting as follows (Counter-Memorial at

18-19):

“86. NAFTA and other investor-State tribunals have held that “the threshold
for finding a violation of the minimum standard of treatment still remains
high, as illustrated by recent international jurisprudence.” This is

reflected in the tribunals’ consistent use of qualifiers such as “clearly
improper and discreditable”, “grossly unfair or unreasonable”, “grossly

unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the Claimant to
sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to
an outcome which offends judicial propriety”, and “a gross denial of
justice _or ifest_arbitrariness falling below acceptable international
standards”. International tribunals use such qualifiers because they
recognize that it is not their role to second-guess the acts of States;
accordingly, the high threshold for proving a violation of international
law protects the autonomy and judgment of government.

 

87. Echoing its stated concern that international tribunals are not to second-
guess States’ decision-making the S.D. Myers tribunal determined that a
breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard would be found:

. only when it is shown that an investor has been treated in such
an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level
that is unacceptable or arbitrary from the international
perspective. That determination must be made in the light of the
high measure of deference that international law generally extends
to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their
own borders.”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Respondent summarizes the arbitral ‘jurisprudence’ of successive NAFTA and
ICSID tribunals in respect of the standard of proof applicable to an allegation of treaty
breach as requiring something more than “mere domestic illegality” (Post-Hearing Brief

at 15).

(04) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISION

6-21

6-22

6-23

6-24

6-25

It is unnecessary here to decide upon each of the general issues raised by the Parties,

save for the following five points:

First, the Tribunal addresses the Claimants’ claims in this Award only as treaty claims
under the respective BITs (together with international law) and not as contractual claims
under the Concession Agreement or infringements of Mexican law. It can hardly do
otherwise: the Claimants disavow in these proceedings any contractual claim; neither of
the Claimants is a contracting party to the Concession Agreement; disputes under the
Concession Agreement are expressly submitted to the jurisdiction of another consensual
forum and not this Tribunal; and this Tribunal’s jurisdiction in addressing the breaches
of the two BITs alleged by the Claimants is limited to the terms of those BITs and

international law, excluding Mexican law.

Second, the Claimants are different and distinct legal persons from the Concessionaire
and its majority shareholder (Mr Davis and his company). Neither of the Claimants
became a party to the several legal proceedings in the Mexican courts brought by or
against the Concessionaire. As regards the legal proceedings brought by the
Concessionaire, the approval of any of these Claimants was made as shareholders only

and could not constitute them parties to such proceedings.

The Tribunal has also kept well in mind the express restriction on its competence,
expressed in Article 10(6) of the Argentina BIT (“The award shall not affect the rights
of any third parties under applicable local legislation”) and, albeit in different terms,
Article 9 of the France BIT (‘Arbitral awards shall be final and binding only on the

disputing parties and only in respect of the particular case”).

Third, it remains a difficult question under international law, on which much ink and
paper has been consumed, to what extent a claimant pleading a treaty breach in an

investor-state arbitration under a BIT can rely on a contractual breach as “a fact”. It is

Part VI — Page 13

6-26

6-27

clear that a contractual breach cannot simply be converted juridically into a treaty
breach, but equally it is clearly necessary for a claimant to recite the factual basis for a
treaty breach which may, in appropriate cases, include allegations of fact amounting
also to a contractual breach, even if no contractual claim is pursued in the particular BIT
arbitration. However, it is not clear whether a treaty breach under international law can
exist against the host state when the same factual conduct is permitted by the relevant
contract between the state and the investor or a third person (such as, here, the
Concessionaire). In the present case, the Tribunal, whilst noting the Parties’ different
submissions, does not think it necessary to address this particular difficulty for the

purpose of its later decisions in this Award.

Fourth, as to ‘deference’, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s submissions to the
effect that this Tribunal should not exercise “an open-ended mandate to second-guess
government decision-making”, in the words of the arbitration tribunal in S.D. Myers.
Accordingly, in assessing the Respondent’s conduct later in this Award, this Tribunal
accords to the Respondent a generous measure of appreciation, applied without the

benefit of hindsight.

Lastly, as to the standard of proof, the Tribunal considers the Parties’ submissions to be
materially similar for practical purposes, as applied in this Award. The standard for the
Claimants’ claims is prescribed by the wording of the respective BITs and international
law; and as to the latter, the Tribunal will here pay due regard to the ‘jurisprudence

constante’ cited by the Respondent.

PART VII: ISSUE C — FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

INTRODUCTION

In this part of the Award, the Tribunal considers the Claimants’ claim that the

Respondent failed to accord to their investments ‘fair and equitable treatment’ as

required by the France and Argentina BITs, by virtue of the various measures taken by

the Respondent towards the Concessionaire, beginning with the extension of the

deadline to register used vehicles (on 21 August 2000) and ending with the Revocation

of the Concession Agreement (on 13 December 2002).

The FET Standards: The provisions relating to “fair and equitable treatment” in the

Argentina BIT and the France BIT respectively provide as follows:

Argentina BIT

“ARTICLE 3. National Treatment and
Most Favoured Nation Treatment

J. — Each Contracting Party shall
guarantee at all times the fair and
equitable treatment of all investors
and investments of investors of the
other Contracting Party, and shall not
prejudice the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposition of their investments
through arbitrary or discriminatory
measures.

[..]”

France BIT
“ARTICLE 4
Protection and treatment of Investments

I. Each of the Contracting Parties
undertakes to guarantee, within its territory
and its maritime zone, the fair and equitable
treatment, in accordance with principles of
International Law, of investments made by
investors from the other Contracting Party
and shall guarantee that the exercise of this
recognised right shall not be impeded either
in law or in practice.

[..]”

Part VII — Page 1

(02) THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

7-3 The Claimants submit that the fair and equitable treatment standard “has been
described as a ‘flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case’”
(Memorial at 105, citing Waste Management v. United Mexican States'). The
Claimants contend that the standard “comprises a number of distinct and specific

elements” (Memorial at 106-107):

“323. [...] A significant number of international arbitral tribunals, as well as
distinguished commentators, have confirmed this. A survey conducted by
the OECD identified the following elements expressed in the recent
practice of arbitral tribunals:

(a) obligation of vigilance and protection;
(b) due process including non-denial of justice and lack of
arbitrariness;

(c) transparency and respect of investor’s legitimate expectations; and
(d) autonomous fairness elements.

324. Professor Schreuer has conducted an extensive examination of recent
arbitral practice. He too concludes that the fair and equitable treatment
standard covers a number of concrete principles including: transparency
and the protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations; freedom from
coercion or harassment; procedural propriety and due process; and good
faith. The conduct of Mexico described in paragraphs [306] above
violated the requirements of Article 3.1 of the Argentina BIT and Article
4.1 of the France BIT.”

[Footnotes omitted]

7-4 The Claimants advance their fair and equitable treatment claims under three headings:
(1) transparency and protection of the investor’s legitimate expectations; (2) due process
and the absence of arbitrariness; and (3) good faith. The Claimants also plead a fourth
element, as regards Talsud’s claim under the Argentina BIT, as regards the
Respondent’s “arbitrary and/or discriminatory measures or to harm the management,

maintenance, use, enjoyment or order of Talsud’s investment”.

' Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3), Award of 30 April 2004, 43
ILM 967 (2004), at para. 99.

Part VII — Page 2

Expectations: As regards the first heading, particularly the Claimants’ “legitimate

expectations”, the following arguments are made (Memorial at 108):

“327. Mexico, in the preamble to the BITs, undertook to provide “a favourable
environment” for Argentina investments (Argentina BIT) and “to create
favourable conditions for French investment” [sic] (France BIT).

328. With regard to investor’s expectations, one commentator has observed
that

“The investor’s legitimate expectations will be based on [a]
clearly perceptible legal framework and on any understandings
and representations made explicitly or implicitly by the host State.
A reversal of assurances by the host State which have led to
legitimate expectations will violate the principle of fair and
equitable treatment.”

And another commentator has noted that

“the balance of considerations having some bearing on fairness
and equity as between investors and States essentially turns on
ways in which State action or inaction may undermine the
economic expectations, profitability and survival of individual
investments ...”.

329. In CME v Czech Republic, the arbitral tribunal concluded that the
“intentional undermining” of the Claimants’ investments constituted a
breach of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment. It referred, in
particular, to the “evisceration of the arrangements in reliance upon
which the foreign investor was induced to invest.”

330. The Arbitral Tribunal in Waste Management noted that in applying the
fair and equitable treatment standard, “it is relevant that the treatment is
in breach of representations made by the host state which were reasonably
relied on by the Claimant.”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Claimants further submit that the measures taken by Mexico following the arrest of
Mr Cavallo “were neither consistent nor transparent”, as follows (Memorial at 113-
115):

“345. The obligation to ensure fair and equitable treatment for investors is

designed to provide a stable, legal framework within which investments
may be made. This objective has been emphasised by a number of

Part VII — Page 3

346.

347.

348.

349.

international tribunals. In Metalclad v Mexico, for example, the arbitral
tribunal found that Mexico had “failed to ensure a transparent and
predictable framework for Metalclad’s business planning and investment;
and found that the “totality of [the] circumstances demonstrates a lack of
orderly process and timely disposition in relation to an investor of a party
acting in the expectation that it would be treated fairly and justly ...”

In Tecmed, the Arbitral Tribunal was called upon to interpret a provision
in the bilateral investment treaty between Mexico and Spain that was
drafted in similar terms to that of the France BIT. The Tecmed tribunal
considered that the provision

“In light of the good faith principle established by international
law, requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international
investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations
that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the
investment. The foreign investor expects the host state to act in a
consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in
its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know
beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its
investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and
administrative practices and directives, to be able to plan its
investment and comply with such regulations. The foreign investor
also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without
arbitrarily revoking any pre-existing decisions or permits issued by
the State that were relied upon by the investor to assume its
commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and
business activities.”

The record indicates that Mexico’s acts and omissions were motivated by
extraneous political considerations rather than by any considerations
relating to the performance by the Concessionaire.

The independent auditor appointed by the Secretariat to monitor and
report on the C e's Lic with its obligatic Analiti
confirmed that the Concessionaire had met all of the achievable Targets
set out in Appendix 13 of the Concession Agreement by October 2000, and
that it was the default of the Secretariat that prevented fulfillment of what
remained. Similarly, the administrative intervener established no breach
by the Concessionaire of the Concession Agreement, the 1998 Law or any
other relevant regulation [C21, C22].

In these circumstances, there were no justifiable grounds for Mexico's
interference with the Claimants’ investment, for the Technical and
Administrative Interventions, for the Seizure of the Registry and the
replacement of the Concessionaire managers, or for the Revocation of the
Concession Agreement.

Part VII — Page 4

350.

Neither the 1998 Law the applicable regulations nor any other rules in
connection with the Registry provided for any type of “technical
intervention” such as that exercised by Mexico in August 2000. The
Technical Intervention was arbitrary and unlawful because:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

Neither the 1998 Law, the applicable regulations nor any other
rule in connection with the Registry provided for any type of
“technical intervention”;

The Secretariat did not provide reasons to support its decision, in
breach of basic principles of the Mexican Constitution and
administrative law;

The 1998 Law did not allow the Secretariat to take any steps which
would interfere with the Concessionaire’s activities without
determining the terms and scope of the intervention (under
Mexican law, public authorities only have what powers the law
expressly grants to them; accordingly, acts not expressly allowed
by the law are not permitted);

The Secretariat attempted to rely on section 25 of the 1998 Law to
justify its intervention. However, the “administrative” (not
technical) intervention for which Article 25 of the 1998 Law
provides can only be ordered in the event of a labour strike or any
other circumstance which may impede the concessionaire’s ability
to render the public service in optimum conditions. The
Concessionaire’s operation of the Registry was not affected in any
significant way by events and continued to be provided at all
times; and

The Secretariat sought to justify the Technical Intervention on the
basis of (totally unrelated) accusations of war crimes levelled at
Ricardo Cavallo. This is nonsensical. It also violated Mexico's
Constitution which prohibits authorities from imposing sanctions
on one party for acts committed by another party. The
Concessionaire is a variable capital stock corporation [sociedad
anonima de capital variable] with its own legal status and assets;
any personal acts carried out by its officers or employees as
individuals, beyond the scope of their duties inside the company,
can only bring about legal consequences for persons committing
the acts, but not the Concessionaire. On the date that the Technical
Intervention was ordered, Ricardo Cavallo had already been
removed from his management duties in the company.

[Footnotes omitted]

Part VII — Page 5

7-7 Due Process: As regards the second heading, i.e. due process and arbitrariness, the

Claimants advance the following submissions (Memorial at 117-118):

“356. One commentator has observed that “fair and equitable treatment
inherently precludes arbitrary and capricious actions against investors”.
As described above, Mexico interfered with the Claimants’ investment
through the unlawful and arbitrary Technical and Administrative
Interventions. The Interventions may properly be characterised as
capricious, having regard to the fact that they were justified neither by
necessity nor reason. Mexico’s actions appear to have been motivated by
a desire to exploit the arrest of Ricardo Cavallo to justify harassment of
the Claimants’ investment and to close the Registry. Mexico acted without
warning, without good reason, arbitrarily and without due process in
seizing the Registry and in subsequently revoking the Concession
Agreement. It acted in the absence of evidence — from the independent
auditors or from the audit conducted as part of the Administrative
Intervention — that the Concessionaire had failed in any material way to
fulfil its obligations under the Concession Agreement.

  

357. Arbitrariness is universally recognized as an element of unfair and
inequitable treatment. For example, the Waste Management tribunal
found that arbitrary conduct would infringe the fair and equitable
treatment standard. In CMS v Argentina, the arbitral tribunal stated that
“any measure that might involve arbitrariness or discrimination is in itself
contrary to fair and equitable treatment.” In this case the Claimants’ use,

joy and dis, l of their ii were impaired by the measures
adopted by Mexico.

.

358. The Claimants’ investment was denied due process by reason of the
Technical and Administrative Inter ions into the C ionaire’s
operation of the Registry, together with the subsequent Seizure and
Revocation. It was also denied due process and justice in respect of the
unlawful issuance by the Secretariat of the Rules of Operation of the
Registry. The Rules were designed by the Secretariat to provide a basis for
termination of the Concession. The subsequent legal proceedings
produced a result that was a violation of the fair and equitable treatment
standards in both BITs.”

 

[Footnotes omitted]

7-8 Good Faith: Under the third heading, i.e. good faith, the Claimants submit that
(Memorial at 118):

“359. [...] while bad faith itself constitutes a violation of the fair and equitable
treatment standard, it is not the case that every violation of the standard

Part VII — Page 6

7-9

360.

361.

362.

Talsud: Finally, on the separate argument concerning the treatment of Talsud’s

investment under the Argentina BIT, the Claimants submit the following (Memorial at

will require bad faith on the part of the State. In Mondev, the tribunal
confirmed that “a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and
inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith”.

In Loewen, the arbitral tribunal observed that

“Neither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals
nor the opinion of commentators support the view that bad faith or
malicious intention is an essential element of unfair or inequitable
treatment or denial of justice amounting to a breach of
international justice. Manifest injustice in the sense of a lack of
due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of
judicial propriety is enough ....”

In CMS v Argentina, the tribunal, emphasizing the need to examine
whether a stable legal and business framework was provided, noted that

“this is an objective requirement unrelated to whether the
Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in
adopting the measures in question. Of course, such intention and
bad faith can aggravate the situation but are not an essential
element of the standard.

In the present case, numerous acts of the Mexican authorities evidence a
lack of good faith, from 28 August 2000 onwards. Mexico exploited the
arrest of Ricardo Cavallo to justify harassment of the Concessionaire
through the Technical and Administrative Interventions, and, subsequently
through the Seizure of the Registry. It used the Technical and
Administrative Interventions and the Seizures, during which period the
Secretariat took control of the Concessionaire’s operations, to create a
case for the eventual Revocation.”

[Footnotes omitted]

119-120):

“363. In respect of Talsud there exists a distinct cause of action arising under

Article 3.1 of the Argentina BIT. This provides that

“Each Contracting Party shall guarantee at all times the fair and
equitable treatment of all investors and investments of investors of

the other Contracting Party, and_shall_not prejudice the
i use, joyment or di: ition of their

through arbitrary or discrimi y measures.”

Part VII — Page 7

7-10

364.

365.

366.

Local Remedies: In response to the Respondent’s argument on the availability of local

remedies in considering a fair and equitable treatment claim, the Claimants submit

The section underlined provides a separate and distinct head of claim that
is available to Talsud, and that Mexico has violated.

The arbitrary nature of Mexico’s acts in relation to the Claimants’
investment has been described at paragraphs [146-202] above. The acts
and omissions of Mexico had the effect of harming the Claimants’

i use and enjoy. of its in and
ultimately deprived the Claimants of the economic use and benefits of
their investment.

 

In the ELSI case, the International Court of Justice observed that

“Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law,
as something opposed to the rule of law ... It is wilful disregard of
due process of law an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a
sense of judicial propriety.”

Mexico’s conduct in relation to the Claimants’ investment met this
standard of arbitrariness: Mexico failed to uphold and respect the legal
framework applicable to the investment and its acts in relation to the
investment were motivated by considerations of political expedience
rather than by just cause; its acts and omissions with regard to the
investment were not characterised by due process.”

[The Claimants’ emphasis, footnotes omitted]

(Reply at 104-05):

“244. The Respondent asserts that the availability of local remedies is an

important consideration in analyzing fair and equitable treatment claims.
It relies upon the Award in Waste Management. In that case, as the
tribunal will be aware, the concessionaire was a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Claimant, so that the Claimant could determine whether or not to
bring proceedings before the domestic courts for inter alia breach of
contract or proceed to seek an international remedy. In the present case
the majority shareholder has initiated proceedings in the name of the
Concessionaire before the Mexican courts. The Claimants are not parties
to those proceedings. It is not apparent what remedies are available to
them — in their capacity as shareholders in the Concessionaire — in any
proceedings before Mexican courts. What is clear is that the highlighted
language in the passage of the Award in Waste Management that is relied
upon by the Respondent is not pertinent to the Claimants: as minority
shareholding investors who are not parties to the Concession Agreement
they are not in a position to invoke a remedy for the breach of the

 

Part VII — Page 8

Concession Agreement before the Mexican courts. In their case the
availability of local remedies is not germane. And interesting as they may
be, the facts in Azinian are entirely distinguishable: the Claimants have
not brought or participated in proceedings before the Mexican courts, and
it is not the aim or objective of these proceedings to determine whether the
decisions of the Mexican courts are or are not in violation of the BITs.
The Claimants are not inviting this tribunal to review the decisions of the
Mexican courts, or to act as a court of appeal. The Claimants have not
claimed denial of justice in their claim concerning unfair and inequitable
treatment; it is therefore curious that the Respondent should address the
issue, unless of course it is seeking to direct the Claimants and the
Tribunal into an issue not yet raised. Furthermore, the Respondent has
not explained why judicial review proceedings brought by another party
should affect the Claimants’ international claims. The Respondent has not
referred to any authority to support the proposition that a foreign investor
who is a minority shareholder is not entitled to bring international
proceedings under a BIT, and the Claimants are not aware of any such
authority.”

[Footnotes omitted]

7-11 In their post-hearing submissions, the Claimants maintained their submission that Waste

Management is inapposite to the facts of the present case (Post-Hearing Brief at 7-8):

“31. First paragraph 116 of Waste Management (No. 2) has to be read with
earlier paragraphs, including paragraph 115; these make it clear that the
Arbitral Tribunal considered that the threshold to be applied for a
violation of the ‘fair and equitable’ standard (“wholly arbitrary”, or
“grossly unfair”, actions) were not met in that case, where the most
important default was limited to a “failure to pay”. The actions of the
Respondent in the present case go far beyond a limited failure to make
payments, a point the Respondent cannot deny, and include actions that
eviscerated and then terminated the Concession on grounds that were
unjustifiable and unsupported by the Respondent's own internal legal
advice (in this regard, paragraph 138 of the Award in Waste Management
(No. 2) is highly pertinent: “The Tribunal has no doubt that a deliberate
conspiracy - that is say, a conscious combination of various agencies of
government without justification to defeat the purposes of an investment
agreement - would constitute a breach of Article 1105(1)”).

32. Second, it is clear that the Tribunal in Waste Management (No. 2)
restricted its comments on the availability of local remedies to
circumstances in which a contractual violation related to monetary
payments arose by reference to an alleged violation of a fair and equitable
treatment standard (Article 1105 NAFTA). In such limited circumstances
it is understandable that the availability of an effective local remedy to

Part VII — Page 9

address a monetary dispute could be a circumstance that a Tribunal
would wish to take into account (the Tribunal was concerned that NAFTA
should not become an instrument of debt collection (paragraph 116)). In
the present case, the disputes concerned far more extensive actions
(extending deadlines, suspending used car registrations, failing to obtain
cooperation agreements, Seizure of the Concessionaire’s premises,
Revocation of the Concession, etc), which were expropriatory in character
and effect (well beyond any violation of the FET standard), and for which
effective local remedies plainly were not available (there has still been no
resolution of the claims in domestic law, notwithstanding the reports of
independent experts appointed by the Mexican court that are consistent
with the Claimants arguments in these cases). Moreover, in Waste
Management (No. 2) the Tribunal found no expropriation, stating that
“[i]t is not the function of Article 1110 to compensate for failed business
ventures, absent arbitrary intervention by the State amounting to a virtual
taking or sterilising of the enterprise” (para. 160) [emphasis added]. The
present cases are a clear example of “arbitrary intervention”, falling
within the standard by which the Waste Management Tribunal would
plainly not have shown deference.

33. Third, the other authorities invoked by the Respondent provide no support
for its claim to deference. Respondent relied on a standard of deference in
the Partial Award in SD Myers v. Canada (13 November 2000, paragraph
261), but failed to refer to the final part of that paragraph, which states
that “The ordinary remedy, if there were one, for errors in modern
governments is through internal political and legal processes, including
elections.” This case also concerned Article 1105 NAFTA, but the
Respondent omitted to mention that the majority chose not to defer and, on
the facts, found a violation of Article 1105, notwithstanding the
availability of local remedies and other ordinary remedies. Respondent
also referred to the Saluka award (Award of 17 March 2006, paragraph
284). That case also concerns ‘fair and equitable treatment’ (Article 3 of
the BIT), and once again the Respondent omits to mention that any
deference that might have been applied did not prevent the Tribunal from
finding a violation because the respondent State had “created an
environment impossible for the survival of” a major bank in which a
foreign investment had been made (paragraph 347). These and the other
authorities provide no assistance to the Respondent.”

7-12 Finally, the Claimants contended during their closing submissions at the main hearing

that [D8:1931]:

“the issue of local remedies [...] is entirely irrelevant in the case of
expropriation. The argument goes entirely to the standard of fair and
equitable treatment, and it has no pertinence to the issue of
expropriation.”

THE RESPONDE:

 

Expectations: With regard to the first heading to the Claimants’ fair and equitable

treatment claims, the Respondent answers as follows (Rejoinder at 80-81):

“275. The essence of the first element of the claim is set out in paragraph 277. It
will be observed that the measures said to give rise to a denial of equitable
treatment are substantially the same as those which are said to give rise to
an expropriation.

a. The Claimants: “277. In sum, based on the representations made
by the Respondent, and on the legal framework of the Renave
Concession, the Claimants were, for example, reasonably entitled
to, and did, expect that the Secretariat and/or the Mexican state
would inter alia:

(1) execute coordination agreements with the federative entities in
order to enable the establishment and operation of the national
registration system, in particular in relation to used cars, and on
which the Concession as a whole was predicated;”

Response: This has already been addressed in detail. The
Claimants fully understood: (i) the voluntary nature of the
coordination agreements; (ii) the risk of the investment and (iii)
the potential problems that missteps, such as the ill-fated
appointment of Mr. Cavallo, could pose for the project.

b. The Claimants: “(2) provide the Concessionaire with the
information from federal agencies required to check the
provenance of used motor vehicle details submitted to the
Registry,”

Response: Although coordination agreements were not executed
prior to the events of 24 August 2000, as admitted by the
Concessionaire in the revocation nullity proceedings, federal
agencies were taking steps to cooperate with Renave.

c The Claimants: “(3) act promptly in respect of any concerns
regarding, or findings of, non-compliance on the part of the

Part VII — Page 11

Concessionaire and within the framework of the mechanisms and
procedures explicitly provided by the Concession contract;”

Response: The Secretariat exercised its legal rights after the
above-mentioned events “within the framework of the mechanisms
and procedures explicitly provided by the Concessionaire
contract.” It communicated its concerns to the Concessionaire
through written and oral means; its third party experts interviewed
concessionaire personnel and examined its premises and such
records as were made available to them by the Concessionaire;
and it informed the Concessionaire, including through reports to
its Board by the administrators and the management in requisition,
of developments affecting the Registry.

In marked contrast, at no time did the Concessionaire inform the
Secretariat of the “doubts” that its Board was having in July 2000
about the functioning of the company’s “technical processes, the
structure of the systems database,” etc. and of the internal
technical audit that it initiated in July 2000.

The Claimants: “(4) act only on the basis of the criteria set forth in
the legal framework governing the Concession and not on the basis
of extraneous political considerations and changing political
circumstances, including those resulting from changes of
government;

Response: The Secretariat’s view is that it acted on the basis of
the criteria set forth in the legal framework governing the
Concession and that it did not act on “extraneous political
considerations and changing political circumstances, including
those resulting from changes in government.” The question of
whether particular measures were properly “motivated” has been
answered affirmatively in the legal challenges that have been
completed to date and insofar as the revocation is concerned, will
be answered by the proper forum.

The Claimants: “(5) act effectively to support the Concession in
the establishment and operation of the Registry in the face of
political opposition that the national registration system might
encounter; ”

Response: The Secretariat did so. Eventually, for reasons not
attributable to the Secretariat, the opposition to the Registry

became widespread.

The Claimants: “(6) not act unilaterally and without consulting the
Concessionaire in taking decisions to amend the application of the

Part VII — Page 12

7-14

7-15

7-16

Concession Agreement, in particular on matters that formed an
essential component of the economic viability of the Concession,
including notably the system for registering used motor vehicles
and any deadlines relating thereto; and”

Response: The Secretariat consulted as required. At some points
however, the Secretariat's and the Concessionaire’s interests
diverged. It was entirely lawful for the Secretariat to have regard
to its own interests and contractual rights under the Title of
Concession.

g. The Claimants: “(7) not act unilaterally and without proper
justification to requisition and then revoke the Concession.”

Response: The Secretariat exercised its legal rights to which the
investors, through their company, had previously agreed. The
Secretariat considered that it had more than sufficient reasons for
acting and has defended its measures in the proper forum. It has
never obstructed the Concessionaire’s access to justice.”
The Respondent submits that the awards relied upon by the Claimants with regard to
transparency and legitimate expectations, i.e. CME, Occidental Petroleum, and Eureko,

are distinguishable on their facts from the present case.

Due Process: As to the second heading to the Claimants’ fair and equitable treatment
claims, the Respondent submits that proving arbitrariness is not a simple matter, quoting
the passage from the ICJ judgment in ELSJ (United States of America v. Italy)

(Counter-Memorial at 148):

“Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as
something opposed to the rule of law ... it is wilful disregard of due
process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of
judicial propriety.”

[The Respondent's emphasis]

The Respondent submits that “[t]here is no evidence whatsoever that the Secretariat
acted in willful disregard of due process or committed an act which shocks, or at least
surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.” The Respondent adds that “[w]hen its acts were
challenged, the Secretariat submitted to the jurisdiction of the [Mexican] courts and
defended its acts. At no time did the Secretariat willfully disregard or disobey a
[Mexican] court order.” (Counter-Memorial at 150).

Part VII — Page 13

7-17 Good Faith: As concerns the third heading to the Claimants’ claims, the Respondent
first contends that “[a]t all times it acted in good faith”, putting the Claimants to the

strict proof of their allegations (Counter-Memorial at 150):

“507. [...] There were good and valid reasons for each of the Secretariat’s acts.
The Claimants may plainly disagree, but international law confers on
States a margin of appreciation to respond to situations as they arise and
Mexico’s acts fall squarely within that margin. It is a universally
accepted principle that good faith is presumed.”

[Footnotes omitted]

7-18 The Respondent also answers as follows (Rejoinder at 84-85):

“277. As far as the third element of the fair and equitable treatment complaint, it
is argued at paragraphs 293-294 [of the Claimants’ Reply] that:

a. The Claimants: “293. For the reasons set out above, the evidence
before the Tribunal does not support the Respondent's contention.
The evidence does not show that there were ‘good and valid
reasons for each of the Secretariat's acts’. To the contrary, the
evidence shows an absence of valid reasons for the actions coupled
with the desire to respond to the political pressures by terminating
the Concession.”

Response: Mexico reiterates its position that it had good and valid
reasons for each of the Secretariat's acts.

b. The Claimants: “294. The circumstances and stated purposes of
the Technical and Administrative Interventions in the Concession
suggest otherwise. While there had been no findings of non-
compliance in respect of the Concessionaire in the period before
October 2000, and the Secretariat itself had confirmed
compliance, the Respondent intervened in the Concessionaire’s
operations at that time with a view to finding grounds for
revocation. In the light of the political opposition to the Registry
that had manifested itself with greater force after the national
election of 2 July 2000, and the Secretariat’s failure to secure the
cooperation and information necessary for the Registry’s effective
operation in relation to used vehicles, it is difficult to escape the
conclusion that the Respondent exploited the allegations regarding
Mr. Cavallo to initiate the end of the Concession. This is evident
from the statements of Mr. Blanco. The Respondent has put no
evidence before the Tribunal to show that the arrest of Mr.

Part VII — Page 14

7-19

Local Remedies: As regards the availability of local remedies and the Claimants’
question as to “why judicial review proceedings brought by another party should affect

the Claimants’ international claims”, reproduced above, the Respondent replies as

Cavallo, or any other factor, justified or necessitated the Technical
Intervention or the measures that followed.”

Response: The reasons given by the Secretariat for the Technical
and Administrative Interventions were later accepted by the
Concessionaire itself in the revocation proceedings. The reasons
were also accepted by the court in the legal challenge of the
Administrative Intervention. The Secretariat had no basis prior to
intervening for directly reviewing how the Concessionaire had
performed its contractual obligations. It had a contractual right to
determine the adequacy of Renave’s performance. Dr Blanco’s
statements, read fairly and objectively, show an unwillingness to
simply terminate the Concession on 15 September 2000.”

follows (Rejoinder at 49-50):

“164. The explanation is as follows: in Robert Azinian et al v. United Mexican

165.

166.

States, just as in the instant case, an international claim was brought by
three of the four or five (the number was never conclusively established)
shareholders of a Mexican company. Their company (DESONA) had been
awarded a solid waste disposal concession granted by a municipality.
After a dispute arose between the Concessionaire and the municipality,
the latter terminated the concession. The company (not the shareholders)
then sued in three levels of the local courts, losing each time. The U.S.
nationals who had invested in DESONA then brought international claims
under NAFTA Chapter Eleven (“Investment”). The central facts of the
two cases are thus on all fours.

Mexico argued before a distinguished Tribunal (Benjamin Civiletti, Claus
von Wobeser, Arbitrators; Jan Paulsson, President) that the
municipality's nullification of the concession had been upheld in legal
proceedings to which the municipality and the company had duly
submitted and that the tribunal had to give international legal effect to the
courts’ refusal to set aside the concession’s nullification unless it was
convinced that the courts had not fairly disposed of the concessionaire’s
claims.

The Tribunal therefore considered the effect of DESONA’s invocation of
local remedies, and concluded:

96. From this perspective, the problem may be put quite simply. The
Ayuntamiento [the municipal council] believed it had grounds for

Part VII — Page 15

7-20

holding the Concession Contract to be invalid under Mexican law
governing public service concessions. At DESONA’s initiative,
these grounds were tested by three levels of Mexican courts, and in
each case were found to be extant. How can it be said that Mexico
breached NAFTA when the A i of Naucalpan purported
to_declare the invalidity of a Concession Contract which by its
terms was subject to Mexican law, and to the jurisdiction of the
Mexican courts, and the courts of Mexico then agreed with the
Ayuntamiento’s determination? Further, the Claimants have
neither contended nor proved that the Mexican legal standards for
the annulment of concessions violate Mexico’s Chapter Eleven
obligations; nor that the Mexican law governing such annulment is
expropriatory.

97. With the question thus framed, it becomes evident that for the
Claimants to prevail it is not enough that the Arbitral Tribunal
disagree with the determination of the Ayuntamiento. A

overnmental authority surely cannot be faulted for acting in_a
manner validated by its courts unless the courts themselves are
disavowed at the international level. As the Mexican courts found
thatthe Ayuntamiento’s decision to nullify the Concession
Contract was consistent with _the Mexican law governing the
validity of public service concessions, the ion is whether the
Mexican court decisions themselves breached Mexico's obli,
under Chapter Eleven.

167. This quotation illustrates Mexico’s point perfectly: for those acts of the
Secretariat that were challenged by the Concessionaire and upheld by the
courts in the instant case, the Secretariat cannot “be faulted for acting in
a manner validated by its courts unless the courts themselves are
disavowed at the international level”, to use Azinian’s words.”

[The Respondent's emphasis, footnotes omitted]

The Respondent concludes that “it is not open to the Claimants to impugn acts of the
Secretariat which have been validated by the Mexican courts”; nor “can the courts’
decisions be reviewed by this Tribunal for any error in applying domestic law”

(Rejoinder at 51). It follows in the Respondent’s view that (Rejoinder at 51-52):

“170. [...] the courts’ treatment of the various complaints against the
Secretariat's measures and the measures themselves must be accepted as
lawful under the two Treaties, unless the Tribunal finds that the court
committed a denial of justice. The Claimants confirm that they do not
contend that any denial of justice occurred. If there is no claim against
the judiciary’s treatment of the Secretariat's measures, no complaint can

171.

172.

173.

174.

be made out against the measures themselves in this proceeding. This
removes a very large portion of the Claimants’ grievances from
international review.

The Reply attempts to distinguish Azinian, stating:

And interesting as they may be, the facts in Azinian are entirely
distinguishable: the Claimants have not brought or participated in
proceedings before the Mexican courts, and it is not the aim of
these proceedings to determine whether the decisions of the
Mexican courts are or are not in violation of the BITs.

That is incorrect. Azinian is directly on point:
e First, like these Claimants, the Azinian Claimants themselves also

had not brought or participated in proceedings before the Mexican
courts.

Second, like these Claimants, it was the company in which the
Azinian Claimants had invested which brought the domestic legal
proceedings.

e Finally, those Claimants, like the instant ones, sought to put the
domestic court decisions aside in the international proceeding by
focusing on the initial measure(s) said to be a breach of treaty,
namely, the termination of the concession and urging the tribunal
to ignore how the complaints against such measures were then
treated by the courts. That tactic was rejected in Azinian and it
should be rejected here.

 

 

Thus, with great respect the Claimants’ argument is that “it is not the aim
of these proceedings to determine whether the decisions of the Mexican
courts are or are not in violation of the BITs,” is precisely the reverse of
the true proposition. On settled authority, it is the aim of these
international proceedings “to determine whether the decisions of the
Mexican courts are ... in violation of the BITs”’, if the Claimants wish to
impugn the acts of the Secretariat which have been upheld by the courts.
It is simply not open to the Claimants to invite this Tribunal to act as if it
is a court of original jurisdiction that may proceed as if the courts have
never spoken and with no need to accord a margin of appreciation to the
decisions of the Secretariat or to those of the Mexican courts.

 

As the GAMI tribunal found, domestic remedies may operate to cure any
potential international wrong. If remedies invoked by the company in
which the foreign shareholder has invested make the company whole, a
derivative claim by the foreign shareholder is unsustainable. In GAMI,
the company in which the U.S. investor held shares (GAM) challenged an

175,

In its post-hearing submissions, the Respondent maintained its position that the

availability of local remedies is relevant to all the Claimants’ claims (Post-Hearing Brief

expropriation decree in the local courts. The courts overturned the
decree, holding that the mills must be returned to their original owner.
While the international claim was being briefed, the relevant secretariat
returned those mills sought by the owner (and the parties were negotiating
compensation for other assets which the owner did not wish to be returned
to it). The operation of local remedies, combined with the foreign
Claimant's inability to establish how it suffered a loss when the enterprise
in which it invested was being made whole through the return of its
subsidiaries, led the international tribunal to reject the international claim
in its entirety.

Likewise, as Azinian shows, the fact that the local courts reject a
complaint by the company in which the foreign Claimants have invested
may also show that the international claim is without merit. It is not
presumed that by virtue of their right of access to international
jurisdiction, foreign investors are by right entitled to compensation. All
investments carry risk and investors regularly suffer losses; compensation
is only granted to a party with proper standing when the State is in breach
of its treaty obligations. In such circumstances, the local courts’
treatment of any domestic legal claims will be critical juridical facts for
the international tribunal when considering whether any treaty breach is
capable of being made out.”

at 16):

“31.

32.

In their Closing, the Claimants contended incorrectly that the availability
of local remedies is relevant only to a breach of the fair and equitable
treatment standard and not to an expropriation claim. In fact, Azinian
premised the expropriation claim’s dismissal on the claimants’
investment’s resort to local remedies and the courts’ validation of the
municipality's nullification of the concession. Waste Management II did
likewise, noting that “the normal response by an investor faced with a
breach of contract by its governmental counter-party (the breach not
taking the form of an exercise of governmental prerogative, such as a
legislative decree) is to sue in the appropriate court to remedy the
breach” and that it was “only where such access is legally or practically
foreclosed that the breach could amount to a definitive denial of the right
(i.e., the effective taking of the chose in action) and the protection of
Article 1110 be called into play.”

There was no taking of the chose in action in the instant case (c.f. the
Renave court actions) and no sovereign act was taken external to the

Part VII — Page 18

contract and applicable legal framework seeking to both negate the
contract and deny judicial relief: Waste Management's focus on
determining whether the State had acted in such a way as to “negate the
rights concerned without any remedy” was applied to a non-contractual
expropriation claim in EnCana Corporation v. Ecuador. Azinian’s
treatment of the impact of “judicial validation of government acts” on an
expropriation claim was applied in Feldman in likewise dismissing an
expropriation claim, the tribunal finding that the Azinian standard could
not be met: “Given as noted earlier that Mexican courts and
administrative procedures at all relevant times have been open to the
Claimants... there appears to have been no denial of due process or denial
of justice there as would rise to the level of a violation of international
law.”

(04) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

7-22 It is necessary first to address more specifically certain aspects of the factual chronology

set out in Part IV above.

(A) Alleged Financial and Technical Deficiencies

7-23 The Parties dispute strongly the existence of any financial and technical deficiencies in
the operation of the Concession by the Concessionaire in mid-2000, as well as the effect
of any such deficiencies. The Claimants submit that the Concessionaire complied with
its technical, security and financial obligations under the Concession, pointing to the
positive results of the audit and technical intervention, Dr Blanco’s testimony as to the
security of information in the database and the absence of any complaints following
Analitica’s review regarding the Concessionaire’s contractual compliance with the

Concession Agreement [D8:1729]. The Respondent, on the other hand, points to 23

Part VII — Page 19

7-24

7-25

(B)

7-26

7-27

alleged deficiencies — security, operations and financial - identified by Ms G6mez-Mont
and her team during the Requisition (amongst other evidence of deficiencies),
contending that the existence of these deficiencies provided a legitimate basis for the

Revocation of the Concession by the Respondent [D8:1792-1803].

The written and oral testimony mirrored this dispute. Extensive testimony was adduced
at the main hearing from Mr Siegrist [D2:387-442, D3:530-559]; Mr Tafariol [D3:655];
Ms Barrera [D4:748, 764]; Mr Rojas [D4: 820-856]; Dr Blanco [D5:988, 1092]; and Ms
Goémez-Mont [D6:1201, 1214, 1306, 1325]. The entirety of Mr. Rojas’ testimony is
dedicated to the issue of the Concessionaire’s technical performance and the issue of

compliance with the terms of the Concession Agreement [D4:813-856].

The Tribunal reiterates what it has recorded earlier in this Award: It does not seek to
address any question as to whether the Concessionaire or the Respondent complied with
the terms of the Concession Agreement, whether it be the former’s technical or financial
performance or the latter’s timely procurement of co-ordination agreements with
federal, state and other agencies. However, the Tribunal does conclude that there is no
cogent factual evidence adduced in these arbitration proceedings which supports the
Respondent’s allegation, at any time, to the effect that the Concessionaire’s conduct

resulted in an imminent peril to Mexico’s national security.

The Used Cars Decree

The Parties dispute the significance of the Secretariat’s decision of 21 August 2000 to
postpone the deadline for the registration of used vehicles from 15 December 2000 to 1

July 2001 (see Part IV (15) above).

The Claimants characterise this act as the first in a series of acts and omissions by the
Respondent which collectively and individually give rise to breach of the respective

BITs [D8: 1691].

Part VII — Page 20

The Respondent, in contrast, defends the Secretariat’s decision to postpone the date for
registering used vehicles as a necessary measure taken to address growing public
opposition to the cost of registering used vehicles and to ensure adequate time to pursue

the negotiation of co-ordination agreements [D1: 178].

Mr Siegrist testified to the significance of the postponement for the Concessionaire as

follows [D2: 450-452]:

“Q. This is a discussion of the announcement on the 21st of August [2000],
where the Secretariat postponed the deadline for registration of used
vehicles by six months. Do you recall that? August 21, it was not 27.
August 21st.

I said 21, but--yes, it was the 21 of August.
A. Yes.

Q. And I just want to direct you to a sentence about midway through the
paragraph, sir. You say that the Concessionaire's business model was
founded on the premise that it would be compulsory for all vehicle users to
register their vehicles within a relatively short period of time. Do you see
that?

A. Yes, that is correct. That was the requirement of the list of bidding
conditions. Yes, it was a brief period of time, a short period of time to
register the fleet of used cars, and that was a big challenge for this
project.

Q. But you didn't mean to suggest in that sentence that all used vehicles in
circulation in Mexico would have been registered by the middle of
December 2000, did you?

A. No. There was an expectation that a large percentage - and this was in
the Business Plan - was going to be registered during the first year, but
there was something else. I mean, it was - more registrations were going
to take place during the second year because we, of course, have
extensions of deadlines, and in our experience these things happen.

But in light of these conditions, there was an expectation, because the
legal framework and the technical framework was there, that a large
number of used cars would be registered during the first year of
operations.”

Part VII — Page 21

7-30 The Tribunal does not consider that the Secretariat’s postponement of the obligation to
register used vehicles from 15 December 2000 to 1 July 2001 constitutes any breach of

either BIT.

7-31 Dr Blanco testified compellingly to the Secretariat’s good sense in coming to the

decision to postpone the deadline for the registration of used vehicles [DS: 1017-1020]:

“Q. So, on the 21st of August 2000, in the attempt to head off the growing
opposition on the issue of cost, you announce a 50 percent cut in cost, the
postponement of the deadline for registering used vehicles from December
15 to July the 15th, 2001.

Now, in relation to the part of your sentence where you say, "the
postponement of the deadlines for registering used vehicles," what did you

expect the implications of that announcement to be?

A. On the dates?

Q. On the pushing back the date for registration of used cars from December
to July.
A. Well, you know the--I'm sure you're very well aware of the term "lame

duck." Ina sense, we had few months left, and one of the things that may
have been happening was that they were going to sign, the governors were
going to sign with this government that is going out as of November the
30th. So, we thought that maybe to give us more time during those months
and give some time to the new administration also, to finalize a new
administration, strong in the sense of just entering, to finalize those
agreements that we could not finalize with the state governments, we
thought that was something that we better do instead of leaving the
problem to the new administration, and the new administration will be in
the Ist of December. They will have from the Ist of December to the 15th
of December. They will find out that some states had not actually have
signed.

So, we thought that giving more time was a good way to be able to have
our administration and potentially the new administration being able to
finalize the agreements with if not all, many more states.

Q. Doesn't it possibly have the opposite effect of making it the new
administration's problem?

A. We don't consider - that was not the intention at all, but also the intention

was quite on the contrary to leave room for the new administration instead
of leaving them a problem of doing something in 15 days.

Part VII — Page 22

7-32

 

7-33

7-34

7-35

  

And you know, actually, what we saw is that it was--that was perceived as
something natural, and you have some ideal dates, and moving the dates
six months was not seen as something of a major or a damaging move
from the part of our government. So, I thought it was perceived as an
adjustment of the dates, not more than that.”

 

The Tribunal accepts Dr Blanco’s testimony. His decision was, in the Tribunal’s view, a
reasonable and measured step on the part of the Secretariat, taken in good faith, in view
of the difficulties it faced at the time in negotiating co-ordination agreements and
contending with growing political controversy over the impending deadline for

registering used vehicles.

The Technical Intervention

The Technical Intervention into the Concessionaire’s operations was ordered by the
Secretariat on 29 August 2000, days after the press reports on Mr Cavallo (see Part IV
(20) above and subsection (D) below).

This was, in the Claimants’ view, totally unjustified and an arbitrary interference with
the Concessionaire’s operations [D8: 1731-32]. The Respondent defends this
intervention as necessary and justified in view of the potential implications of the
Cavallo incident on the Concession and increasing public concerns over the security of

information stored in the Concession’s database [D1:193-94].

Mr Salgado testified that the requirements for decreeing a technical intervention under
the Concession Agreement were never fulfilled [D2:270]. In closing argument, the
Claimants also summarized the state of the Concession at the time of the Technical

Intervention and the results of the Technical Intervention, as follows [D8:1728-1729]:

“On the 24th, with remarkable speed, audits were carried out, with a view
to protecting the security of the database and the information held by the
company, but no infringements were found. Five days later, on the 29th of
August 2000, the Technical Intervention was carried out. Mr. Erasmo
Marin was appointed, a technical man with apparently impeccable

Part VII — Page 23

credentials, and no one has questioned his integrity or his qualifications to
carry out the task.

In the Technical Intervention he identified no deficiencies or failings in the
technical security issues. Mr. Blanco was asked: "Are you aware that
there was ever a breach of [...] security or confidential information
during your time - that, I assume, goes all the way up to December 2000" -
and his answer at page 989, line 13 was, "Not a breach of security, no."

By that date, the Concessionaire had complied with its contractual
obligations in relation to security, in relation to financial contributions, in
relation to other matters. There is no contemporaneous evidence from
that period showing that there were any concerns or questions about
factual or technical matters. The famous White Book raises no issues.
The report of Analitica, who were the consultants to the Secretariat, raise
no contractual issues.”
Whilst Dr Blanco testified on behalf of the Respondent that Mr Marin, the technical
intervener, had reported no misuse at that time of the Concession’s database, he
explained the purpose of the intervention as meeting the public alarm at the accusations

against Mr Cavallo, in the following terms [DS: 1085]:

“A. We did not terminate the Concession. We were only managing the
Renave.

As I said before, this was one of our last resources to keep the Concession
alive. We did not decide to take the Concession away. We decided to
intervene in a managerial fashion precisely to keep it alive.

Even if the new vehicles registration was proceeding accordingly, the fact

that the sequence of events of the arrest of Cavallo and the death of Mr.

Ramos, will make also the buyers of new vehicles have an extremely

serious doubt about the security of giving their data to a databases which

may be controlled by a criminal organization.”
In the immediate aftermath of the news concerning Mr Cavallo’s alleged criminal past
and his arrest in Mexico, the Technical Intervention appears to have been a rational
response by the Secretariat, taken in good faith, to address public outcry and concern
over the security of personal information maintained in the Concession’s database.
Moreover, Dr Blanco’s motive was manifestly to ‘keep the Concession alive’, by
interposing the Secretariat between the Concessionaire and its Mexican critics. As such,

the Tribunal does not consider this act to constitute any breach of either BIT.

Part VII — Page 24

(D)

7-38

7-39

The Cavallo Incident

In the Parties’ respective submissions, the Claimants minimize the importance of the
Cavallo incident. The Claimants stress that while there was a dip in the registration of
used vehicles in August 2000, this dip is likely to be attributable to the Secretariat’s
postponement of the deadline to register used vehicles and not the Cavallo incident
itself, observing that the registration of new vehicles increased in September 2000
[D1:45-46]. The Respondent, on the other hand, characterises the Cavallo incident as a
threshold event [D1:138]. The Respondent observes that there was a public outcry in
response to the allegations against Mr Cavallo and an immediate expression of
opposition to the Concession by many state and other institutions, making the

negotiation of co-ordination agreements “extremely difficult” [D1:188-89].

In its written pleadings, the Respondent also alleges a contributory fault against the
Claimants based on Article 39 of the ILC’s draft Articles on State Responsibility and on
the fact that Talsud was responsible for Mr Cavallo’s appointment as the
Concessionaire’s General Director, claiming that “whatever prospects it [the
Concession] had for its public acceptance and viability were destroyed by the Cavallo
scandal.” (Rejoinder, para. 247). This was reiterated in closing argument, when the
Respondent focused on the shareholder response to Mr Cavallo’s disclosure to them on
23 August 2000 and submitted that any award of damages should be reduced for
contributory fault as a result [D8:1924-27]. The Claimants refute contributory fault,
pointing out that it was accepted that no one knew prior to August 2000 of Mr.
Cavallo’s alleged past and that even Mr. Blanco testified that a background check on the
shareholders, including Mr Cavallo, prior to granting the Concession did not produce
any negative information, concluding as follows: “If Talsud is responsible for it, then
the Government of Mexico has, in a sense, ratified that action and carried out its own

due diligence, which, curiously, in light of the evidence that has now appeared before

Part VII — Page 25

this Tribunal, they did not identify.” [D8:1945-46]. The Tribunal returns to these

submissions separately in Part XI of this Award.

From all the evidence, as already noted above, the Tribunal concludes that Mr Cavallo’s
arrest was a highly significant event for the Concession, damaging public confidence in
the Concession and increasing the difficulty in negotiating co-ordination agreements,
but that it was not necessarily, by itself, a crippling event leading inevitably to the end

of the Concession.

Mr Salgado testified as follows on cross-examination with regard to the impact of the

Cavallo incident on the Concessionaire [D2:331-332]:

“Q. — I would like to look into the accusations on August 24th and the following
days regarding the past of Mr. Cavallo. Do you remember the
accusations?

A. Yes, I do remember the accusations, but I thought this was about the
investment of Gemplus and Talsud in the company and about the treaty.
What are the accusations of Mr. Cavallo's past [have] to do with
investment.

Q. 1 understand, but I would like to review with you the accusations against
Mr. Cavallo. Do you remember that he was accused of homicide?

A. I remember, yes.

Q. Torture?

A. Those were the accusations.

Q. Of taking the assets of the prisoners during the dictatorship and taking
control of the cars of the prisoners?

A. Those were the accusations, yes. To this date, I understand that Mr.
Cavallo hasn't been trialed. He is still awaiting for a trial. Nothing has
been proven yet, and those were accusations for a time during the
dictatorship period in Argentina.

Q. Was there any discussions within the Board since the accusations could
risk the whole project?

A. They had, of course, a devastating effect on the image of Concesionaira

Renave. Those accusations, yes. But we were always - we always thought
that it didn't matter if the sexual orientation, the gender, the past of any

Part VII — Page 26

Ms Barrera also testified on cross-examination that the Concessionaire’s suppliers and
creditors did not immediately express any concern following the Reforma publication

on 24 August 2000, but rather approached the Concessionaire only after the First

general manager, if he was doing a good job at the company, why would
that make it a problem. He was a diligent and responsible General
Manager. He always performed correct. He never conducted anything
without integrity, so we thought that that had to be taken into account.

Unfortunately, Mr. Cavallo's past damaged the company, but his past and
his work in the company never mixed.”

Administrative Intervention of 15 September 2000 [D4:761-763]:

“0.

Co + 8 &

>

When did you first become aware of the allegations against Ricardo
Cavallo?

Not until the day he was arrested. Until that time, I didn't know anything.
And you were shocked, I take it, as many others were?
Of course. Concerned.

And there was an indication in your statement that when this news broke,
creditors and suppliers started to call Renave to ask questions of what was
going on?

That is correct.
And they were worried about being paid, I presume?

Concerned mainly about what was going to happen. The question they
asked is, "What's going to happen?" We told them that, in effect, the
question of used cars was suspended, and that that would lead to changes
or would entail changes in the supply amounts originally provided for, but
that each and every one of the commitments would be abided by the
company and, indeed, it did carry them out.

We sat down with a person from the automobiles, the supply of kits of - the
paperwork for the used papers or used cars, rather. In some cases, we
cancelled some part. In other cases, the deliveries that were originally set
were deferred.

I just want to be a little more precise about timing. So, when the news of

Mr. Cavallo's arrest was publicized, that's when you began to receive
inquiries from suppliers and your creditors; correct?

Part VII — Page 27

A. No. When we began to get these questions most was after the
intervention, the Administrative Intervention, which was 15 September
2000. Things happened so quickly, the events in succession, the arrest of
Mr. Cavallo, the Technical Intervention, the death of the Deputy
Secretary, the Administrative Intervention, all of that happened in the
course of approximately 20 days. But the calls from the suppliers and
when we sat down with them, well, that was after the Administrative
Intervention.”

7-43 Dr Blanco testified as follows with regard to the impact of the Cavallo incident

[D5:1036-1038]:

“Q. — If you could turn over the page to Tab 5. It's an article of the 29th of
August 2000, and there is just one little section I would like you to have a
look at. At the bottom, it says, about Mr. Cavallo, Sobre el Seftor Cavallo:
"There is not an accusation of theft or document falsifications. The
accusations made by the Spanish judge refer to genocide, terrorism, and
torture," he clarified. But that apparently is a quotation attributed to you.
To the best of your recollection, is that an accurate quotation?

A. What I can recall, it was a very costly affirmation on my part. I recall the
leftist newspaper saying, "He is only a murderer - Blanco". So, I recall
that there was a question raised, and I said, "Look, the accusations by the
judge, not by anybody else, but the judge is only accusing him of this."

Q. What's the distinction between - well, what was the significance of the
distinction for you between being accused of vehicle theft or document
falsifications on the one hand and genocide, terrorism, and torture on the
other hand?

A. I was trying to explain to this person that trying to dispel the hypothesis
that maybe the databases had been somehow misused by Mr. Cavallo
since he was somebody that was accused of being a thief and a forger of
documents, so I was trying to dispel the hypothesis that not only did we
have strong standards, maybe not the standards that were committed by
the Concessionaire, but good standards, and that not only that, but it was
not in a sense - a specialty of Mr. Cavallo was not to do that.

Q. Was that response an instinctual response, or was it in a sense part of an
effort to respond to the crisis?

A. Well, you know, through all this ordeal, we kept committed to the Registry.
We kept committed to the need of the Registry, and we kept committed to
the whole scheme of being a Concessionaire. We were committed to that.
We believe that was the right way to do it, and we wanted to do everything
possible for that to continue. And, in that sense, trying to mitigate the

Part VII — Page 28

7-46

(E)

T-AT

storm that was happening, the public storm that was happening was one of
my roles.

So, anything we tried--that we did was try to diminish the public uproar
against the Renave so as to maintain the Renave as a feasible entity.

Q. So just to help on my understanding, are you saying that the effort was to
shift it to genocide and away from car theft as a way of protecting the
Renave Concession?

A. Yes, that's what I said.”

The Tribunal accepts this testimony.

Immediately following publication of the Reforma article on Mr Cavallo on 24 August
2000, the Secretariat ordered the emergency audit of the Concessionaire’s operations,
the outcome of which confirmed that the confidentiality of information had not been
breached (see Part IV (19) above). However, still facing intense pressure from the
public and political opposition concerning the security of personal information collected
and managed by the Concessionaire, the Secretariat ordered the Technical Intervention

on 29 August 2000, overseen by Mr Marin (see Part IV (20) above).

One week later, on 7 September 2000, Dr Ramos Tercero was found dead under tragic
and mysterious circumstances (see Part IV (21) above). Coupled with the Cavallo

incident, this was a crippling event for the Concession threatening its future.

The Death of Dr Ramos

The Parties agree that the death of Dr Ramos adversely affected the Concession and the
Concessionaire. In closing argument, the Claimants submitted that whilst the
Secretariat’s attitude towards the Concessionaire changed following Dr Ramos’ death,
the Revocation of the Concession was still not inevitable, pointing to Dr Blanco’s

testimony to the effect that Revocation was not on his mind following this tragic event

Part VII — Page 29

7-48

7-50

[D8:1734]. The Respondent contended in closing argument that the damage done to the
Concession by the Cavallo incident was much exacerbated by Dr Ramos’ death, making
the conduct of the Concession extraordinarily difficult for both the Secretariat and the

Concessionaire [D8:1859-60].

Mr Salgado testified as follows on cross-examination as to the impact of Dr Ramos’

death [D2: 348-49]:

“Q. The next day [7 September 2000] the body of Mr. Ramos Tercero was
discovered; right?

A. That's correct.
Q. And his death was a major event for the Renave project; is that not right?

That's right. He was the one that conceived the project, and he was
actually responsible for it before the Secretariat.

Q. What was the impact of the lamentable death of Deputy Secretary Rail
Ramos Tercero in the media?

A. In the media, well, there were a lot of newspaper clips, a lot of reports. I
do remember that one of the experts that spoke on TV at some point or in
the news, in the radio news, I don't remember, said that it had been
impossible for Mr. Ramos Tercero to commit suicide because he had so
many deep cuts in his wrists that would have made it impossible for him to
cut one wrist and then without tendons cut the other wrist. And then the
jugular and the femoral vein as well, so that looked very impossible for a
suicide, it seemed. I remember that.”

Mr Siegrist testified [D3: 586]: “The Cavallo affair was one thing, and then the death of

Mr. Ramos Tercero was something that took this to a higher level.”
Mr Taiariol testified as follows on cross-examination [D3: 683-685]:

“Q. Now, going back to the 24i" [August 2000] in that meeting of the Board,
there was a concern on the part of the members of the Board on the
impact on Renave's public image?

A. Obviously. How could it be otherwise? We don't live in a bubble. It's
obvious that we were concerned. Beyond the fact that - well, beyond what
I said that I think that or thought that it was a crisis that was building up.
In any event, the arrest of a person who is the Director General of the

Part VII — Page 30

company, a person who, moreover, in some cases, was respected and by
us, and in terms of the start-up of the Renave, of course, we were all
concerned. We were very concerned.

Q. And this major concern, did that include the possibility that the Renave
project might not continue?

A. No, I don't think so. At that time - I'm giving you my opinion - it's strictly
a personal opinion--I don't think so because, actually, the alternative of
continuing with the project was perfectly within reach. I think that most of
the structure was prepared to provide the service, and that that could be
done well. I think that from the standpoint of continuity of the project, the
death of Ramos Tercero was much more important than the arrest of
Ricardo Cavallo.

You obviously knew Mr. Rail Ramos Tercero very well; is that not right?
Yes.
And the Concessionaire was in constant contact with him?

There was fluid contact.

oS FF © F 8

And no doubt the news of Ratil Ramos Tercero's death was devastating for
the Concessionaire, for the Renave project?

A. Yes.

I was much more impacted personally. Ratil Ramos Tercero was not a
person who had a suicidal syndrome or anything of the sort. He was the
father of four children. He was a servant, a believer, an integral person.
So, the truth is that first, it was very painful for me personally; and,
second, from that moment, no doubt it was going to be very difficult to go
forward because I think that part of the heart of Renave was Ratil Ramos
Tercero.

Q. So, then, it was very difficult for the Renave project to continue forward?
Is that what you're saying?

A. Yes. Not only that, but after Ramos Tercero, there was one other on the
list. Perhaps I was on the list. Who would know?”

7-51 Dr Blanco testified as follows [D5:1077-1080, 1081-1082]:

“... Now, the events of the 24th [August 2000] obviously had a significant
impact. If we could go now to paragraph 25 of your statement, do please
take a moment to refresh your memory and have a quick look at it. And

Part VII — Page 31

this, of course, you are referring to the period not only after the 24th, but
also after the death of Ramos Tercero; I appreciate that.

You say: "It was simply untenable for the Registry to continue under the
control of the Concessionaire," and you did what you could to support the
Concessionaire, but you faced almost universal condemnation. Now, it
seems that on the 6th of September 2000, you attended a meeting with the
various persons at the Concessionaire, and that is referred to in
paragraph 24. The question I have for you is: At what point did you
conclude that it was simply untenable? Was that before or after Ramos
Tercero's death on the 7th of September?

Well, on the 6th of September, we reviewed together with Mr. Davis and
some other representatives of the corporation Renave the state of affairs,
and we tried - at that point in time, kept our communication open with the
Concessionaire to talk about difficulties, but most importantly it was a
meeting where it was said, well, things should get better sometime in the
future. And in that sense, it was - at the end I considered it a positive
meeting. Things were difficult, but let's wait to see how things develop.
That changed very fast with the death of Mr. Ramos. It was, as it
appeared in the newspapers and again another storm of articles, his death
was related to the Cavallo affair. Somehow people related to Cavallo
have killed Mr. Ramos. That was sort of the line. So, obviously, they were
trying to hide something terrible that had happened with the Registry, with
the database. That was the line that you could read in the newspapers,
listen in the radio and watch on the TV.

At that point in time, our concern again was how can we keep Renave
alive. The opposition was terrible at that point in time. The public
opinion when you multiplied the effect of Cavallo, a vehicle thief and a
forger of documents, with what was seen at that point in time a crime, a
murder because of Renave. Things got really impossible to handle in the
sense of having a viable institution being at that point in time managed by
the Concessionaire. So, we said, okay, let's give it one more chance.
Instead of taking the Concession away, let's keep the Concession, let's take
the administration and hope for the better. Hope for this storm to calm
down in the months to come, in the next administration, or, if it was
possible, before, for the administration of Renave to be given back to the
Concessionaire.

So, to answer your question in point, it was the death of Mr. Ramos, the
role that he played in Renave, and the hypotheses there were out in public
opinion that his death was related to Mr. Cavallo, specifically that they
were trying to silence him on something terrible that had happened to the
Registry. That made us as a measure to save Renave and to give another
chance to the shareholders of Renave, that made us decide to take the

Part VII — Page 32

administration, but still give it another chance for the shareholders of
Renave to keep the ownership of Renave.

Q. But your view on that changed after the 7 of September?
Yes.
[.-]
Q. What precisely was it about the death of Ramos Tercero that caused you

to recognize that the Concession was dead?

A. I wouldn't - I didn't think the Concession was dead. I was doing my last
effort to keep it alive. Instead of taking the Concession away, we decided
to manage the Concession, keeping the ownership in the actual
shareholders.

I may sound a little repetitive, but at that point I was convinced that we
were trying to fight against the idea that a thief and a forger of documents
had somehow penetrated the registry. We were fighting against that. And
in the meeting on the 6th of September, the conclusion is things looked
terrible, but not real terrible. Things will improve. Maybe the Cavallo
storm will start dying down. When Undersecretary Ramos dies, and his
death is directly related by the press as an act of a criminal organization
trying to silence the person, the connection between the criminal
organization and the Registry, that was the point in time when I said there
was no way the owners, the shareholders of Renave can keep on managing
Renave. Unless we manage, this institution will absolutely die because
nobody will register.

Q. Did you form that view because of the identity of the shareholders or the
way in which the Concession was functioning?

A. I formed that view because the sequence of events, Mr. Cavallo and Mr.
Ramos and the connection and the public opinion that came out
specifically is that the property of thousands of Mexicans—actually
millions of Mexicans--was in danger because their data had been
communicated to a delictive to a criminal organization. That was in the
air. That was public opinion. Everybody was feeling that, and that's a
moment in which I thought that the best chance to keep Renave alive and
to keep it as a concession was for us to take the administration.”

 

The Tribunal accepts this testimony, confirmed by the contemporary reaction of Talsud
(see Part IV (22) above). The Tribunal notes, particularly, Dr Blanco’s benevolent
motives towards the Concession in September 2000, namely ‘how to keep Renave alive’

until the public storm had calmed down.

Part VII — Page 33

7-53 The Tribunal concludes that the combination of these two events, the Cavallo incident
and Dr Ramos’ death, would have destroyed all public confidence in the Concession
permanently - but for the Secretariat’s conduct between 24 August and 15 September
2000 in deciding to front the Concessionaire and thereby to shield it from adverse public

opinion.

(F) The First Administrative Intervention

7-54 One week following Dr Ramos’s death, on 15 September 2000, the Secretariat
suspended the obligation to register used vehicles and initiated the First Administrative
Intervention (see Part IV (23) and (24) above). The Claimants contend that these acts
were arbitrary and a breach of both BITs; whereas the Respondent takes the position

that this act was a lawful exercise of its rights under the Concession Agreement.

7-55 Several witnesses testified on behalf of both the Claimants and the Respondent in
respect of the motivation for and the results of the First Administrative Intervention. In
the Tribunal’s view, the best testimony as to motive came from Dr Blanco. As already
cited in part E above, Dr Blanco testified on cross-examination that the Secretariat’s
intention was to preserve the Concession, not to terminate it [D5: 1085-1088]:

“Q. But by the 13th or 14th of September, when the Administrative

Intervention came into being, revocation of the Concession was clearly in
your mind, was it not?

A. Revocation of the Concession was not in my mind.

Q. Can I take you to Tab 13 of the bundle 1E. At the bottom of page 128 is
the announcement, you said: "Revocation of the Concession was not in
my mind."

A. May I -

Q. Of course.

Part VII — Page 34

7-56

7-57

It was not in my mind as an action that I was willing to take during the
administration of President Zedillo. Obviously, we have considered that
in the sense of what are the options, but whenever we came and we had
another alternative that was not the revocation of the Concession, history
shows that we took - we took the other option. That was always an option,
but it was an option that we decided not to take.

Was it an option you were hoping that another administration might take?

No, not at all. Not at all. My hope was that the next administration would
be under better weather than we were at the time, and that things will
come down, and that the discussion will be more done under objective
conditions instead of the - how could - -a lack of English words, but under
the very, very stormy and convoluted times that we were living at the end
in these months when - after those terrible events of Mr. Cavallo and Mr.
Ramos, it was, indeed, the best way to describe it is as a perfect storm ...

.. Thirteenth, 14th of September, would it be fair to say that you were
looking for reasons to terminate the Concession?

I was not looking - I was looking for ways to continue with the
Concession. I thought that the effort that we did through so many years,
since 1996, if my mind doesn't fail, from 1996 to year 2000, we invested a
lot of resources in studies, a lot of resources in lobbying, a lot of resources
and a life of one of my most dear colleagues in the process. The last thing
that I wanted is to accept is that this initiative was a failure. I wanted to
keep it alive, and it was not that I wanted to pass it to the new
administration. I just wanted to keep it alive because I thought there was
the right institution, and that it was on the wrong circumstances; that
given time and better conditions, the institution should survive, not only
survive, but give the Mexicans the type of assurances on the property that
they deserve and they would decrease the robbery of vehicles.”

As to the results of the First Administrative Intervention, in the Tribunal’s view, the
most reliable evidence comes from the contemporary written reports of Mr Marin, the
administrative intervener (who was not called as a witness by the Respondent in these

arbitration proceedings).

It is not disputed by the Parties that Mr Marin was a “technical man” with respectable
credentials whose integrity in carrying out the tasks put to him by the Secretariat is
unquestioned [D8:1729].
problems troubled the operation of the Concession, none which appear to have been

fatal to its ability to function for its intended purpose. Indeed, for new vehicles, the

Part VII — Page 35

It is clear on the basis of Mr Marin’s reports that several

7-58

7-59

7-60

National Vehicle Registry was a relative success, notwithstanding the non-registration

of used vehicles.

By February 2001, Mr Marin had reported to Dr Blanco’s successor, Secretary Derbez,
that the Concessionaire’s financial statements “showed a satisfactory trend” and
expressed the opinion that this situation would enable “the necessary adjustments to be
made to its structure, procedures and operations so as to achieve the level of service and

quality demanded by both the legislation and the population.”

In other words, whilst the Concessionaire was not yet free of difficulties in February
2001, it was at least on the mend, or so it seemed until Mr Marin was replaced as
administrative intervener with Ms Gomez-Mont on 7 May 2001. As already recited
above in Part IV (25), Mr Marin’s removal followed shortly after a report prepared by
Mr Luis Pablo Monreal Loustanau on 18 April 2001 for Secretary Derbez sharply
criticized Mr Marin for having “lost power and presence with the concessionaire”,

which was viewed by Mr Monreal as “detrimental to the intention of the intervention”.

The Tribunal decides that the Secretariat’s First Administrative Intervention was a
measured and reasonable response to the very real and serious public concerns raised
Mr Cavallo’s arrest and Dr Ramos’ death; that it was intended by Dr Blanco to save the
Concession and to be temporary until such time as the ‘storm’ had abated; and that its
conduct by Mr Marin, from September 2000 to April 2001 was not intended to harm the
Concession or the Concessionaire. In short, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent’s

conduct up to 18 April 2001 does not amount to any breach of either BIT.

The Second Administrative Intervention

As already noted above, the Claimants’ primary submission is that their loss
commenced on 21 August 2000, with the postponement of the obligation to register
used vehicles and that the Second Administrative Intervention of 7 May 2001 was only
one of several intermediate acts amounting to a breach of the two BITs. On the
Tribunal’s decisions so far as regards the FET standards under the two BITS, that
submission fails as regards any act by the Respondent preceding the Second

Administrative Intervention.

As regards the Second Administrative Intervention, the Claimants specifically reject the
testimony of Ms Gémez-Mont , the intervener, to the effect that this intervention was
justified [D8:1690-91]. The Respondent submits that, with regard to the Second
Administrative Intervention, its actions were reasonable in the circumstances, have been
upheld by Mexico’s domestic courts and cannot therefore amount to any breach of the

BITs [D8:1791, 1830].

The testimony on the Second Administrative Intervention was largely provided by Ms

Gémez-Mont [D6:1172-1345] and Mr Gonzalez [D6:1347-1375].

Ms Go6mez-Mont testified as follows, on cross-examination, with regard to her

instructions from the Secretariat as intervener [D6:1194-95, 1211-1214]:

“Q. Let's look at what happened in April and May of 2001. Your appointment
takes place, does it not, on the 7th of May 2001?

A. That is correct.

Q. In the period between your leaving FONALES [sic] and being appointed

to take up the position at Renave, did you begin to get briefed and to be
involved in informational aspects of what the issues were facing Renave?

A. The meeting that--at the meeting that I had with the Secretariat.

Part VII — Page 37

nO

When I sat down with Mr. Derbez, his instructions were very clear, very
concise and direct. He told me we need to maintain the operation, and we
need to make a diagnosis. Those were the only directions I received. He
didn't tell me anything else. This is a person who was a professional.
This is a person who knew we had to get our job accomplished; therefore,
I did not receive any further instructions.

You said that he gave clear and very brief instructions. Did you talk at
that first meeting about a Requisa of the Concession?

No, once again, I repeat, he told me you need to maintain the operation
and perform a diagnostic.

Did he talk at all about possible revocation of the Concession?
No, he did not.
So, at what point did the issue of a Requisa first come up?

As I told you before, I was the Administrative Manager. I was the
Intervenor of the Concessionaire. My duties were to maintain the
operations and to diagnose the situation. That's what I had to do. [...]

Well, it's just that I'm a little surprised by the answer that you have given
me because it contradicts what you wrote in your written statement, and I
wonder whether you can explain to us which of your two statements is
correct. If I can take you to paragraph four of your statement, you say,
and I will read out, "Upon being named Intervenor, Secretary Derbez
called me to a meeting in which he commented that the concept of the
Registry should be strengthened, and he instructed me to perform a
general evaluation of the Registry that would permit the Secretariat to
determine if there were bases to revoke the Concession.

Yes.

So, you have just contradicted your own Witness Statement. Which is the
correct answer?

Let me explain once again. We have to undertake an assessment so that
the decisions provided for by the law can be made. The law might speak
of sanctions, fines, seizure, requisition, revocation, et cetera. We have to
show and provide the basis, the assessment so that the areas with the
authority could make the decisions to come up with a solution. I'm not
saying yes or no. I'm saying that we have to undertake the assessments so
that the law would tell us what the solution to the problem or non-problem
would be. At that time we still hadn't come up with the assessment.

Well, it strikes me that--

Part VII — Page 38

Excuse me. In the same, it says that there could be a seizure or Requisa,
which is another power under Mexican law.

I understand you're not saying yes or no, but you have also said yes and
no, and I'm slightly confused. Either he did talk about revocation or he
didn't talk about revocation. It's like pregnancy, you are or you are not.
It's a yes-or-no answer. Which are of your numerous answers, yes, no, or
neither yes or no is correct?

Let me answer in the same way that would allow the Secretariat to
determine whether there were any bases for revoking the Concession,
imposing sanctions, or proceeding with the Seizure of the company. These
are legal concepts that are in our laws, that are in the Concession
Agreement, in terms of reference, regulations, and so forth. You see them
there. So, it would be to enable the Secretariat, if you will, to take action.
Paragraph four, last four lines. It's not saying go forward with the
revocation, the sanctions, and so forth. Those were not my authorities. I
had to carry out the assessment. All right?

But I'm still slightly confused as to whether or not you got instructions to
consider whether or not there was a ground for revocation. Could you
just give a yes-or-no answer to that question?

Based on the facts that one might come up with, it was any of those three
might have been options, any of the three. Seizure, sanction, revocation,
any of them, depending on what I would find. The facts - the facts in
Mexico speak.

The only fact I'm looking for is whether or not you and Mr. Derbez talked
about revocation at that meeting. It's a very simple yes-or-no answer.

Mr. Derbez reminded me that the regulations in Renave gave him the
authority to adopt any of those three measures. We are talking about the
law and regulations that we have.

So, you did talk about revocation?

No, he didn't tell me that I had to go in to undertake an assessment so that
that assessment would tell us what was going to happen. I wasn't in the

Mr Gonzalez testified as follows, on cross-examination, with regard to the operation of

the Second Administrative Intervention [D6:1354-55]:

“0. Could you look upon the first page, page 129 in the Spanish, 137 in the
English, Article 2, the second line says, "The Administrative Intervenor,
with the purpose of maintaining the optimal operation of the public
service," and then item one, "shall hold the Office of the Intervenor with
the authorities and powers inherent to the General Director." Do you see
that?

A. Yes, I see it.

Q. And these are the powers that Mrs. Gomez Mont inherited from Erasmo
Marin; is that not correct?

A. According to the document, that is right.

Q. Thank you. We have finished with this document for the time being. So,
while you say in your statement that in practical terms, Mr. Bilbao was
responsible for the day-to-day operations, legally the Intervenor had the
powers of the General Director; is that not correct?

A. Legally, that is right.”

The Second Administrative Intervention commenced on 7 May 2001 and ended on 25
June 2001, with the Requisition. It will be recalled that prior to or around the
appointment of Ms Gémez-Mont, Dr. Gonzalez prepared a note for Secretary Derbez
concerning the feasibility of seizing and/or revoking the Concession: see Part IV (25)

above.

The Tribunal determines that the Secretariat’s Second Administrative Intervention was
markedly different in purpose and content from the First Administrative Intervention.
Whilst the latter was motivated by a desire to “keep [the Concession] alive” [D5:1088],
the former’s motivation was quite the opposite. Under the new regime of Secretary
Derbez, it is clear that the groundwork was being prepared to revoke the Concession.
This culminated in the Requisition of the Concession on 25 June 2001 and its eventual
Revocation over a year later, on 13 December 2002, both of which were directed at
terminating any hope that the Concession might be revived and its activities restored to
registering both new and used vehicles, as Dr Blanco had intended in August-September

2000.

The Requisition and Revocation

The Claimants summarised their case in their closing submissions at the main hearing to
the effect that the Respondent had deliberately set in motion a series of unlawful events
which led “inexorably” to the Revocation of the Concession on 13 December 2002
[D8:1691]. The Claimants submitted that, as the heart of the evidence which emerged
during the main hearing, “it is the events of June 2001 that become absolutely essential
because what has now become clear is that there really was no substantive basis at all
for Mexico to seize the Registry in June 2001”, i.e. the Requisition of 25 June 2001
[D8:1692]

The Respondent strongly refutes this characterization of the several events leading to
the Requisition of 25 June 2001 and the Revocation of 13 December 2002. The
Respondent submits that the Secretariat faced “extraordinary circumstances and sought
to address them properly” [D8: 1791]. The Respondent justifies the Requisition and
Revocation on the basis of the deficiencies identified by Ms Gémez-Mont, as the

intervener, in the operation of the Concession by the Concessionaire [D8: 1792].

Factually, the Tribunal does not consider that Ms Gémez-Mont’s “23 deficiencies”
played any material part in the Secretariat’s decisions regarding the Requisition and
Revocation. It is clear from the evidence adduced in these proceedings that these
decisions in June 2001 and December 2002 bore a quite different stamp from those
taken by the Secretariat in August and September 2000; that the later decisions
inaccurately invoked imminent peril to national security in stark contrast to the earlier
decisions (which had not done so) in not dissimilar circumstances; and that the
difference between these respective decisions, as taken by the old and new Secretariats,
evidences a clear intention by the new Secretariat to terminate the Concession and
Concession Agreement without due regard to the Claimants’ legal rights under the two

BITs.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

It is now appropriate to decide the legal issues in regard to the Claimants’ FET Claims

on the facts found by the Tribunal in Parts IV and VII (04) above.

The Tribunal decides to apply the primary wording of the FET standards in the two
BITs, interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, namely “fair and equitable treatment”. The Tribunal accepts the Claimants’
submissions that this phrase in both BITs includes the exercise of good faith or the

absence of manifest irrationality, arbitrariness or perversity by the Respondent.

Given that the Tribunal here addresses only the Claimants’ rights arising from the two
BITs under international law, the Tribunal is not concerned with the different legal
rights of the Concessionaire under the Concession Agreement and Mexican law, which
were the exclusive subject-matter of the decisions of the Mexican courts invoked by the
Respondent. Hence, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s arguments based on “local

remedies”.

It is not necessary, on the facts of this case, to consider more fully the legal scope of
these FET standards; and, for reasons which appear below, it is also unnecessary to
consider the separate legal argument of Talsud based on the second limb of Article 3(1)
of the Argentina BIT, relating to the Respondent’s obligation to “not prejudice” the

management etc of their investments through arbitrary or discriminatory measures.

Applied to the facts found by the Tribunal, the Tribunal does not consider that the
Claimants established any FET claim for breach of Article 3 of the Argentina BIT or
Article 4 of the France BIT based on events prior to 25 June 2001, i.e. before the
Secretariat ordered the Requisition. Whilst the Secretariat, internally, had already
developed its malign motives towards the Concession with the Second Administrative

Intervention of 7 May 2001, these had not crystallised sufficiently into overt unlawful

Part VII — Page 42

7-16

7-77

7-78

conduct towards the Claimants under the two BITs before the Requisition. (This
decision includes Talsud’s separate argument based on the second limb of Article 3(1)

of the Argentina BIT).

The Tribunal considers, conversely, that the Claimants established their FET claims
with both the Requisition of 25 June 2001 and the Revocation of 13 December 2002. On
the facts found in this Award, the Tribunal can only characterise the Respondent’s
conduct from 25 June 2001 onwards to 13 December 2002 as manifestly irrational,
arbitrary and perverse, being also conducted in bad faith towards the Claimants and

their rights as investors under the two BITs.

The interim period of almost 18 months from 25 June 2001 to 13 December 2002 is
perhaps not directly relevant to the Tribunal’s decisions in this Award, notwithstanding
that it comprised composite acts consequential upon the Secretariat’s decisions in regard
to the Requisition and the Revocation. These acts certainly do not mitigate or extinguish
the unlawfulness of either act under the BITs; and, indeed, the prolongation and
increasing seriousness of the Respondent’s conduct only confirms such unlawfulness

from the outset, namely the Requisition of 25 June 2001.

For the purposes of establishing the date of the first FET breach of both BITs by the
Respondent, as a completed act, the Tribunal determines that breach as occurring on 25

June 2001 with the Secretariat’s decree ordering the Requisition.

PART VIII: ISSUE D - EXPROPRIATION

INTRODUCTION

In this part of the Award the Tribunal considers the Claimants’ claims that the various
measures adopted by the Respondent, beginning with the Secretariat’s extension of the
deadline to register used vehicles on 21 August 2000 and culminating in the Revocation
of the Concession Agreement on 13 December 2002, amounted to unlawful
expropriation (direct and indirect) or were equivalent to such expropriation, in violation

of the two BITs.

The expropriation provisions of the Argentina BIT and the France BIT respectively

provide as follows:

Argentina BIT France BIT
“ARTICLE 5. “ARTICLE 5
Expropriation and Indemnification Expropriation and Indemnification

1. — Neither of the Contracting Parties may 1. Neither Contracting Party shall take
nationalise or expropriate, either directly or any direct or indirect measures to
indirectly, an investment made by an_ expropriate or nationalise, or any other
investor from the other Contracting Party in measure which has the equivalent effect,

equivalent to the expropriation or its territory or its maritime zone, except:

nationalisation of this investment, except: (i) for reasons of public utility;

a) for reasons of public utility; (ii) on the condition that these

d) with compensation,
paragraphs (2) and (4) below.

pursuant to

2. — The compensation shall be equivalent to
the market value of the expropriated
investment immediately before __ the
expropriating measure was implemented
("date of expropriation") or before the
expropriating measure was made public.
The valuation criteria shall include current
value, declared tax value of tangible
property, and other criteria appropriate to
determine market value.

3. — Compensation shall be paid without
delay, in full and be freely transferable.

4. — The amount paid shall be no less than
the equivalent amount which would have

been paid as compensation on the date of

expropriation in a
currency on the international financial
market, that currency having _ been
converted to the standard market quotation
on the date of valuation, plus interest
corresponding to a reasonable commercial

freely-convertible

rate for that currency until the date of

payment.”

THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

(iv) on payment of compensation in
accordance with the provisions of
paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.

2. Compensation shall be paid without
delay, in full and be freely transferable.

3. The compensation shall equate to the
fair market value or, where this is not
available, to the actual value of the
expropriated or nationalised investment
immediately before the expropriation or
nationalisation was carried out and shall
not take account of any changes in the
value which arise as a result of the
expropriation becoming known prior to it
taking place. Criteria to be considered for
the evaluation are the current value, the
asset value including the declared tax
value of tangible property and any other
criteria which, in the circumstances, are
appropriate to determine the fair market
value. The compensation, its amount and
its mode of payment shall be fixed no later
than the date of the expropriation. The
compensation will be subject to interest
calculated at the applicable market rate
until the date of payment.”

The Claimants submit that “the measures adopted by Mexico in the period prior to the

Revocation amounted to indirect expropriation and/or measures tantamount to

expropriation, and that, at the time of the Revocation, a direct expropriation occurred”

(Memorial at 94). These measures are identified by the Claimants as follows (Reply,

para. 246 at 106):

Part VIII — Page 2

e “the unilateral decision of 21 August 2000 to extend the deadline for
registration of used vehicles as a result of the Secretariat’s failure to
secure cooperation agreement [sic] with the federative entities used car
registrations by the Respondent;

e the decision to proceed to the Technical Intervention on 28 August 2000;

e the decision to proceed to an Administrative Interventions [sic] of 14
September 2000 and, thereafter the failure to secure any further
cooperation agreements with the federative entities;

e the seizure of the Registry on 25 June 2001; and
e the revocation of the concession on 13 December 2002.”

8-4 The Claimants submit in connection with the expropriation provisions in the two BITs

that (Memorial at 97):

“290. It is notable that Article 5.1 is broadly drafted to encompass “any
measure having a similar [sic: equivalent] effect” to nationalization or
expropriation. The Claimants submit that the acts and omissions of the
Mexican government authorities in relation to the Claimants’ investment
prior to and culminating in the revocation of the Concession Agreement,
constituted measures having a similar effect to expropriation. The acts
and omissions comprising measures having similar effect to expropriation
in this case included each of the acts set out at paragraph [271] above, as
well as those acts taken cumulatively.

291. Each of these sovereign acts of Mexican government authorities had the
effect of depriving the Claimants of the use and enjoyment of their
investment, by rendering the Concessionaire’s effective operation of the
Registry impossible. Taken together the acts initially constituted an
indirect and/or creeping expropriation of the Claimants’ investment and
then a direct expropriation following the Revocation in December 2002.
Interference with the Claimants’ investment began shortly after the
commencement of the Concession Agreement, and increased to the point
that the Claimants were deprived of the totality of their control, economic
use and enjoyment of their investment. The measures taken by Mexico did
not fulfill the requirements of Article 5.1 of the two BITs, and accordingly
violated these provisions.”

Part VIII — Page 3

8-5 The Claimants refer to several awards! dealing with the definition of “indirect
expropriation”, highlighting in particular the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal’s discussion in

Starrett Housing v. Iran and Tippetts v. Iran (Memorial at 98-99):

“294. One of the most widely-cited descriptions of indirect expropriation is that
of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in Starrett Housing v Iran, which observed
that

“it is recognized in international law that measures taken by a
State can interfere with property rights to such an extent that these
rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have
been expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have
expropriated them and the legal title to the property formally
remains with the original owner.”

295. It is notable that in the Starrett case, Iran had appointed a temporary
manager of the enterprise in question, Shah Goli. The Tribunal observed
that

“the succinct language of [the decree] makes it clear that the
appointment of Mr Erfan as a temporary manager in accordance
with its provisions deprived the shareholders of their right to
manage Shah Goli. As a result of these measures the Claimants
could no longer exercise their rights to manage Shah Goli and
were deprived of their possibilities of effective use and control of
it.”

296. The Tribunal acknowledged that “assumption of control over property by
a government does not automatically and immediately justify a conclusion
that the property has been taken by the government, thus requiring
compensation under international law”. However, in the circumstances of
the case, the Tribunal found that the investor no longer had the right to
manage the project, and concluded that Iran had interfered with the
Claimants’ property rights to an extent that rendered them so useless that
they must be deemed to have been taken.

297. Similarly, in Tippetts v. Iran, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal found a taking
of property where a temporary manager was imposed, holding that:

' The Claimants also cited the following legal authorities: Tippetts v. Iran, Award, 22 Jume 1984, 6 Iran-US CTR
219, at 225; Metalclad Corporation v. United States of Mexico (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award, 30 August
2000, at para. 103; Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt (ICSID Case No.
ARB/99/6), Award of 12 April 2002, para. 107; Antoine Goetz et consorts c. République du Burundi (ICSID Case
No. ARB/95/3), Award of 10 February 1999, at para. 68; Antoine Biloune v. Ghana, UNCITRAL, Award on
Jurisdiction and Liability of 27 October 1989, 5 ILR 189, at para 209; Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A.
v. The Republic of Costa Rica (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of 17 February 2000, 5 ICSID Reports. 153,
para. 6.

 

Part VIII — Page 4

“A deprivation or taking of property may occur under
international law through interference by a state in the use of that
property or with the enjoyment of its benefits, even where the legal
title to the property is not affected.”

298. The parallels with the present case, in which Mexico interfered with the
Concessionaire’s operation of the Registry, seized the Registry and ousted
the Concessionaire’s personnel from management of the Registry, are
clear.”

[Footnotes omitted]

8-6 On the basis of these authorities, the Claimants contend that (Memorial at 102):

“306. [b]y any standard, the measures taken by the Mexican government
authorities in respect of the Registry and the Concessionaire had the effect
of depriving the Claimants of the use and benefit of their investment in the
Concessionaire, and constituted measures having similar effect to
expropriation. _Mexico’s acts and omissions rendered the effective
operation of the Registry impossible, notwithstanding __ the
Concessionaire’s full impl. i of its i under the

Concession Agreement. In particular:

(a) The Concessionaire was denied its right to operate and manage
the Registry by the Technical and Administrative Interventions,
which were not justified in law (under the Concession Agreement,
the Law or relevant regulation) or on the facts.

(b) The Concessionaire was denied its right to operate and manage
the Registry by virtue of the Seizure of the Registry in June 2001,
which resulted in the replacement of the Concessionaire managers
with government appointees and the denial of the Concessionaire’s
access to and any control over the Registry including through the
cancellation of passwords, the denial of access to offices and
computers, the cancellation of existing bank authorizations, and
the revocation of powers of attorney.

(c) The Concessionaire was deprived of its rights under the
Concession Agreement by the Revocation of the Concession
Agreement by Mexico.

(d) The operation and management of the Registry pursuant to the
Concession Agreement was the Concessionaire’s only business
(LECG/Horwath letter para. [3]). The Revocation put the
Concessionaire out of business.

Part VIII — Page 5

(e) The profitability and scale of the Concessionaire’s business, as
reflected in the projections made in the Business Plan submitted as
part of the bidding process, depended entirely upon an income
stream derived from registration fees (LECH/Horwath Letter para.

[24]).

(f) The measures taken by the Secretariat at first reduced and

led the Con ionaire’s busi and ulti ly frustrated

its business operations entirely when the Concession Agreement

was revoked. The current value of the Concessionaire is
insignificant (LECG/Horwath Letter paras. [12-14]).

 

 

(g) The market value of the shares held in the Concessionaire by the
Claimants was dependant on the Concessionaire’s ability to
generate income from registration fees. [...]”

[Footnotes omitted]

8-7 The Claimants respond as follows to the Respondent’s refutation of the legal authorities

invoked in support of their expropriation claim (Reply at 110-11):

“256. First, it is beyond argument that an expropriation, or acts tantamount to
expropriation, can occur in the context of a contractual relationship: see
Eureko v Poland; Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Ltd. v. Egypt;
and CME v Czech Republic. Moreover, as indicated above, the Claimants’
claim is made under the BITs in respect of their investment in Renave. The
Claimants’ Memorial set out the reasons why the acts and omissions of the
Respondent in this case constituted not only violations of contractual
obligations vis-a-vis Renave, but also, and independently, violations of
obligations owed to the Claimants in respect of their investment in Renave
under the French and Argentina BITs. As the Tribunal in Azurix v
Argentina Republic observed, it is established that:

“[w]hether one or series [sic] of such [contractual] breaches can
be considered to be measures tantamount to expropriation will
depend on whether the State or its instrumentality has breached
the contract in the exercise of its sovereign authority, or as party
to the contract.

257. Second, in the present case, as the Claimants have demonstrated in
paragraphs 58 to 228, it is quite clear that in its conduct towards the
Renave Concession — and in particular from 21 August 2000 — the
Respondent acted not as a party to the contract but outside the contract
and in the exercise of its sovereign authority. The decisions to suspend the
registration of used cars, to intervene in and ultimately to terminate the
Concession were based on political, not contractual, consideration. Each

Part VIII — Page 6

of these acts were sovereign acts, not contractual acts. That this is the
case is clear from the account of events in paragraphs 58 to 228,
including the statements of President-elect Fox and Mr Blanco.

258. The Respondent’s assertions that it acted at all times as a party to the
Concession Agreement are undermined by the fact that it did not take the
steps envisaged in the Concession to address any of the alleged breaches
of the Concession by Renave, none of which had been identified before 21
August 2000. As described in paragraphs 194 to 202, for example, the
Concession Agreement contains procedures and penalties for any
violations of confidentiality requirements of the Concession. The
Respondent never sought to invoke these penalty provisions. Nor did it
consult with the Concessionaire with regard to any need to review or
modify the operating regulations of the Concession, as foreseen in the
Concession, in the light of any identified operational deficiencies. Instead,
on the basis, inter alia, of alleged but unspecified security concerns, it
intervened directly in the running of the Concession, and it did so
explicitly with a view to seeking grounds for revocation, as Mr Blanco
made clear. It seized the Registry, and finally revoked the Concession.
These were sovereign acts, not contractual acts.”

[Footnotes omitted]

8-8 In respect of the Respondent’s refutation of cases not involving the exercise of
contractual rights by a state co-contracting party, the Claimants respond that (Reply at

114):

“263. [...] [t]he Claimants did not assert that the Starrett Housing and Tippetts
cases involved contractual relationships between the claimants in those
cases and the government of Iran. However, like the present case, they did
involve unjustified interference with the operation of an investor’ business
[sic], seizure of property and the replacement of the investor’s personnel.
Like the claimants in the Starrett Housing and Tippetts cases, Renave lost
the right to manage and operate its business.”

8-9 The Claimants submit in their Reply that, whilst the Respondent disputes that an
expropriation occurred on the facts, it does not challenge the legal principle under
international law that “the consequences of regulatory governmental action on a
foreign-owned shareholding in a Mexican investment can constitute an act of

expropriation” (Reply at 107).

8-10 | The Claimants further submit that the Respondent’s actions were unlawful because they

could not be justified on grounds of public interest or public utility, nor were they

Part VIII — Page 7

accompanied by the payment of adequate compensation, both requirements of Article
(1)(d) and Article 5(1)(iv) of the Argentina and France BITs respectively (Reply at
108).

In regard to the Respondent’s argument that the acts constituting expropriation were
lawful because they were taken pursuant to legal rights under the Concession
Agreement and Mexican law to respond to a situation that was not of the Respondent’s

making, the Claimants respond as follows (Reply at 108-09):

“253. The Respondent’s argument is misconceived in fact and law. It is
misconceived in fact because the series of acts for which the Respondent
bears responsibility commenced on 21 August 2000 and occurred prior to
the arrest of Mr Cavallo, which was simply a useful pretext for
terminating the Concession and in no way undermined the viability of the
project. The decision to extend the deadline for the registration of used
cars was taken by the State in the context of a wave of public and political
opposition to Renave. It is an act that is directly attributable to the
Respondent. To claim that the act was “not attributable to the State” is
unarguable. Further, the facts clearly establish that the Respondent
publicly articulated its desire to find a reason to terminate the concession
as early as September 2000: the words of Secretary of State Blanco are
unambiguous on this point. At every stage thereafter the State was seeking
reasons to terminate without finding them. This is especially clear from
the internal legal advice sent by Dra. Maria del Refugio Gonzalez to Dr.
Derbez in the second half of 2001.

254. The facts establish that the Secretariat has not observed any ground
giving rise to material concerns at any point prior to 21 August 2000 and
that it had still not found any grounds a year or so later when Dra.
Gonzalez wrote to Dr. Derbez. Neither the Concession Agreement nor
Mexican law allows the state to go on fishing expeditions looking for
grounds to terminate a lawful concession. In her statement Maria Jimena
Valverde Valdes, the Head of the Judicial Matters Unit of the Secretary of
the Economy, refers to Article 25 of the Renave Law in support of the
claim that the act of requisition was justified on grounds of national
security. Yet no new facts had emerged between 21 August 2000 and 27
June 2001 to support a claim that the State faced a situation of “imminent
danger to national security”, and Dr Gonzalez’s letter indicated that the
working group had not found any such facts. On the basis of the evidence
before the Tribunal the State acted for political reasons and without
regard for the rights and interests of Renave and its shareholders when,
on 21 August 2000, it extended the deadline for registration of used cars.
The Respondent has put no evidence before the Tribunal that could justify

Part VIII — Page 8

its decision to proceed to the Technical Intervention on 28 August 2000 or
to the Administrative Intervention on 14 September 2000. In particular, it
has not explained why the arrest of Mr Cavallo could not have been
managed with less draconian measures within the scheme envisaged by
the Concession Agreement. It has not provided any explanation as to the
failure to provide public reassurances, as Mr Blanco had promised, or
why the State thereafter gave up on its efforts to secure cooperation
agreements with the federative entities. In the circumstances the
Claimants submit that it is self-evidence that the actions taken by the State
were not for a public purpose and were not lawful.”

[Footnotes omitted]

8-12 In any event, the Claimants assert that the Respondent’s acts were unjustified and
disproportionate and therefore expropriatory, in breach of the two BITs (Reply at 115-
116):

“267. Even if it were true, which the Claimants deny, that there were problems
with the management and/or financing of the Concession and/or with the
level of security provided in respect of vehicle registration data, the
Respondent’s premature and escalating interference in the Registry’s
operations, from the Technical Intervention in August 2000, to the
revocation of the Concession in December 2002, were disproportionate
and extra-contractual responses. The Respondent has been at pains to
point out, and the Claimants dispute, that the steps it took were within its
contractual rights under the Concession. But at no point does the
Respondent explain why none of the less draconian measures explicitly
envisaged in the Concession were taken.

268. The far-reaching and disproportionate nature of the Respondent’s
measures supports that Claimants’ submission that they were
expropriatory in nature. The Tribunal in Tecmed, considering the exercise
of regulatory powers by the respondent state, observed that, it would
consider:

‘In order to determine if they are to be characterised as
expropriatory, whether such actions or measures are proportional
to the public interest presumably protected thereby and to the
protection legally granted to investments, taking into account that
the significance of such impact has a key role upon deciding the
proportionality.’

It is noted that:

‘There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality
between the charge or weight imposed to the foreign investor and

Part VIII — Page 9

the aim sought to be realised by any expropriatory measure. To
value such charge or weight, it is very important to measure the
size of the ownership deprivation caused by the actions of the state
and whether such deprivation was compensated or not.’

269. The Respondent's conduct in the present case was not proportionate to
any operational or implementation difficulties that the Concession may
have been facing as a result of matters that were within the responsibility
and control of the Concessionaire. The Secretariat never appears to have
considered any option except revocation from at least mid September
2000.”

8-13 With regard to the Respondent’s obligation to pay adequate compensation, the
Claimants contend that the language of the expropriation provisions in the two BITs

serve a “dual function” (Memorial at 104):

“312. [...] First, they establish that a failure to provide compensation in
accordance with the standard defined will render any act of expropriation
unlawful by reference to the BIT. Second, they give rise to a distinct and
enforceable legal obligation that establishes the standard of compensation
that is to be paid when an act of expropriate has occurred.

 

313. Inthe present proceedings, Mexico authorised the Concessionaire to make
payments to each of the Claimants as shareholders, by way of dividends,
return of capital and reimbursement for start up costs. However, these
payments barely cover the Claimants’ actual capital contributions and
contributions to the start-up costs. The payments are not “equivalent to
the market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the
expropriating measures was implemented” (Argentina BIT, Art 5.2) [sic]
and they do not “equate to the fair market value” (France BIT, Art. 5.2).
(LECG/Horwath Letter paras. [16-17]).”

[Footnotes omitted]

8-14 | The Claimants conclude that the Respondent’s “failure to pay compensation to the
Claimants in accordance with the fair market value before the expropriation occurred

thereby renders the expropriation unlawful by reference to the BITs” (Memorial at 104).

a. Claimants:

THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

The Respondent contends that the legal materials invoked by the Claimants to advance
their expropriation claims are inapposite: these are based on different grants of
jurisdiction and applicable laws. The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ reliance
upon awards of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal, including Starrett Housing and Tippetts, is
misplaced because those decisions are “inextricably bound up in the Iranian revolution,
visceral anti-American sentiment and widespread attempts to interfere with or disposes
U.S. nationals of their investment in commercial interests there” (Counter-Memorial at

144).

The Respondent further distinguishes the awards in Southern Pacific Properties v.
Egypt, Wena Hotels v. Egypt, and Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland from the present
case, submitting that “[a]ll three cases address the state’s exercise of legislative
authority external to the contract, its intervening by taking some extra-legal action as in
ELSI, or otherwise acting in such a way as to negate the rights concerned without any

remedy” (Counter-Memorial at 146).

The Respondent denies that any expropriation claim can be made out on the facts of the
present case, responding to each act or omission alleged by the Claimants to give rise to

an expropriation as follows (Rejoinder at 71-73):

“Lud

 

In its Memorial (sic) the Claimants set out the basis for their
claim that the acts and omissions of the Respondent amounted to an
expropriation of the Claimants’ investment in Renave, or alternatively
measures that amounted to or were similar in effect to an expropriation.
As a result of measures taken by the Respondent, acting in a sovereign
capacity, the Claimants were deprived of the use and benefit of their
investment in the Concessionaire, Renave. These measures included:

- the unilateral decision of 21 August 2000 to extend the deadline for
registration of used vehicles as a result of the Secretariat’s failure to
secure cooperation agreement with the federal entities used car
registrations by the Respondent;’

Part VIII - Page 11

Response: This (i) was never the subject of contemporaneous complaint;
(ii) was a bona fide and reasonable decision taken in light of the public
opposition and the Secretariat’s desire to defuse it by reducing the cost of
registration; (iii) reflected the difficulty of persuading recalcitrant state
governments of the desirability of concluding coordination agreements;
and (iv) was accepted as such by the Concessionaire in the revocation
nullity proceedings. In short, it was not an ‘interference’ at all and
cannot be considered to be part of a series of measures giving rise to an
expropriation.

Claimants: ‘- the decision to proceed to a Technical Intervention on 28
August 2000;’

Response: This (i) was initially accepted as legitimate by the
Concessionaire’s Legal Director at the time; (ii) in any event, was
necessitated by the crisis engulfing the Registry; (iii) was less intrusive
than the power to administratively intervene explicitly recognized by the
Title of Concession; (iv) was justified by the Secretariat having regard to
the events of 24 August 2000 [i.e. the Cavallo Incident]; (v) was the
subject of an administrative proceeding before the Secretariat which was
then overtaken by the Administrative Intervention which followed it 14
days after the technical intervention.

Claimants: ‘- the decision to proceed to an Administrative Interventions
[sic] of 14 September 2000 and, thereafter, the failure to secure any
further cooperation agreements with the federative entities’;

Response: The Administrative Intervention was: (i) expressly motivated by
the events of 24 August - 7 September 2000 [i.e. the Cavallo Incident and
Dr Ramos’ death]; (ii) expressly contemplated by the Concession’s legal
framework; (iii) accepted as fully justified and properly motivated by the
court in the Concessionaire’s subsequent amparo against the Secretariat;
and (iv) was thereafter accepted by the Concessionaire in its own account
of the facts in the revocation nullity proceeding as being motivated by the
“enormous uncertainty’ generated by the relevant events.

As for the failure to secure any further cooperation agreements with the
federative entities this was: (i) is [sic] attributable to the collapse in
confidence in the Registry occasioned by the events of 24 August — 7
September 2000; (ii) attributable to the disinterest of the states to respond
to SECOFI’s attempts to restart such negotiations; and (iii) in any event,
reflected the voluntary nature of such agreements and the Secretariat’s
inability to compel their execution, a fact that the investors in Renave
were well aware of at the time of the making of their investment, (iv) and,
in any event, the failure to execute coordination agreements cannot, under
any objective standard, be considered an expropriation.

Part VIII - Page 12

Claimants: ‘- the seizure of the Registry on 25 June 2001’;

Response: It was a requisition, not a ‘seizure’. In this regard: (i) the
Secretariat’s right to requisition the Registry was expressly contemplated
by the Concession’s legal framework (Article 25 of the Renave Law); (ii)
the Secretariat’s decision to requisition the Registry was reasoned and in
writing; (iii) the courts subsequently refused the Concessionaire’s request
for an injunction against the seizure citing as the basis of their decision
the grounds of public order and national security; (iv) during the period of
requisition, and without interference from the requisition administration,
the shareholders of Renave resolved to reduce their variable capital in the
company by 63.8 million pesos and paid themselves a dividend; and (v)
further judicial proceedings in relation to the requisition were ultimately
overtaken by the Title of Concession’s revocation.

  

Claimants: ‘- the revocation of the concession on 13 December 2002.’

Response: The revocation: (i) was a power contemplated in the Title of
Concession; (ii) was the subject of an administrative proceeding before
the Secretariat; (iii) in which the Secretariat gave the Concessionaire
notice of the proceeding and an opportunity to make written submissions
to it; (iv) the Secretariat provided lengthy written reasons for its decision
to revoke the Concession; (v) when the company was returned to the
shareholders, it received a cash balance of some 140 million pesos which,
combined with the above-mentioned return of variable capital and
dividend, more than made the investors whole; (vi) when the
Concessionaire submitted its revocation nullity claim to the proper forum
in March 2003, the Secretariat duly submitted to the jurisdiction of the
courts and defended its position; and (vii) Mexico has stated that it will
comply with any final decision of the courts if it is adverse to the
Secretariat.

8-18 The Respondent further submits as follows (Rejoinder at 73-74):

“251.

There is ample authority that where a_ state instrumentality has
contracted with an investment of a foreign investor, the tribunal must
look at the terms of the contract in order to determine whether the State
is acting as co-contractant. While the Reply attempts to distinguish
Waste Management’s relevance to the facts of this case, no attempt is
made to respond to the same point being made in Salini and SGS about
extra-legal actions taken outside of a contractual relationship that
terminate or vary previously agreed contractual rights. Here the
Secretariat indubitably possessed contractual rights of audit, inspection,
intervention, termination, requisition, and revocation. The exercise of
such rights cannot at the same time be considered the termination or
variance of Renave’s contractual rights by means not contemplated by
the contract. In this case there are no unilateral acts, outside the

Part VIII - Page 13

8-19

8-20

The Respondent contends that it “is simply untenable to try to equate a State’s
exercising a right of requisition or revocation to which the investor agreed in contract,

which exercise is then submitted to the proper forum under the contract, with State

contemplation of the contracting parties, which purport to vary the
contract’s terms.”

[Footnotes omitted]

action that expropriates contractual rights of an investor” (Rejoinder at 74).

Respondent relies upon Azurix Corp. v. Argentina in making this point (ibid.):

“254. [...] The point is made in Azurix, a case cited repeatedly in the Reply,

255.

256.

On this analysis, the Respondent concludes that “even if this Tribunal were not to share
the Secretariat’s view of the circumstances which led it to exercise its legal rights, on

settled authority, the resort to local remedies in and of itself disposes of the Claimants’

where that tribunal observed when discussing expropriation:

Whether or not a series of such [contractual] breaches can be
considered to be measures tantamount to expropriation will
depend on whether the State or its instrumentality has breached
the contract in the exercise of its sovereign authority, or as party
to the contract.

Bearing in mind the Counter-Memorial’s distinction between those cases
involving a State’s breach of contract and this case, which involves the
exercise of a State’s contractual rights, Azurix supports Mexico’s point:
international tribunals approach the acts of a State entity by focusing on
whether the acts complained of can be seen to fall within the terms of the
contract or whether there is an exercise of the State’s sovereign power
external to, or unconnected with the contract and not contemplated by its
terms. As the Azurix tribunal noted in the sentence immediately preceding
the quotation cited by the Claimants at paragraph 256 of the Reply:

The Tribunal agrees that contractual breaches by a State party or
one of its instrumentalities would not normally constitute
expropriation.
If this is the case for contractual breaches by the State party or one of its
instrumentalities, it is perforce much stronger where the complaint is

directed at the exercise of the State’s contractual rights”

grievances, unless they contend that the courts denied justice to the Concessionaire”

(Rejoinder at 75).

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Claimants submit that the “heart” of this case is expropriation [D8:1767],
concluding that a violation of the expropriation provisions in the two BITs is so “self-
evident”, that the main question before the Tribunal is only how much the Claimants
are entitled to receive by way of compensation from the Respondent [D1:84, D8:1697].
As already noted, the Claimants claim that the first act of unlawful expropriation
occurred on 21 August 2000 with the Secretariat’s postponement of the obligation to
register used vehicles, being the relevant date for the purpose of determining a

completed breach of the two treaties by the Respondent.

The Respondent concludes that each of the Secretariat’s acts was justified from 21
August 2000 to 13 December 2002, strenuously denying that any unlawful

expropriation can be made out on the facts of the present case.

Given the Tribunal’s earlier decisions in Part VII of this Award in regard to the
Respondent’s violations of the FET standards in the two BITs, it serves no purpose here
to analyse in detail the Parties’ respective legal submissions on expropriation. The
Tribunal applies the legal submissions made by the Claimant, to the general effect that
an indirect expropriation occurs if the state deliberately deprives the investor of the
ability to use its investment in any meaningful way and a direct expropriation occurs if

the state deliberately takes that investment away from the investor.

In short, on the facts found by the Tribunal earlier in this Award and applying Article 5
of the two BITs, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have not established their
case as regards the period from 21 August 2000 up to (but not including) the

Requisition of 25 June 2001. Conversely, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants have

Part VIII - Page 15

8-25

8-26

established their case on indirect expropriation with the Requisition on 25 June 2001

and direct expropriation with the Revocation on 13 December 2002.

The Tribunal concludes that these expropriations were unlawful under the BITs and
international law, given the facts found by the Tribunal and the further fact that the
Respondent did not meet the condition required by Article 5 of both treaties regarding
the payment of adequate compensation. As will appear later from Part XIV of this
Award, the Tribunal does not consider that the Claimants’ receipt of dividends, return
of capital and reimbursement of start-costs amounted to adequate compensation

required by Article 5 of the two BITs.

In reaching these conclusions, the Tribunal has paid no regard to the Claimants’
allegations that the Secretariat violated the terms of the Concession Agreement or
Mexican law. As the Tribunal has already noted several times above in this Award, this
Tribunal is not concerned with the legal rights of the Secretariat and the Concessionaire

under the Concession Agreement or Mexican law.

(05) THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

8-27

8-28

The Tribunal decides, on the facts found above by the Tribunal in Parts IV and VII of
this Award, that the Claimants’ investments were unlawfully expropriated by the
Respondent, indirectly with the Requisition on 25 June 2001 and directly with the
Revocation on 13 December 2002, in violation of Article 5 (1) of the Argentina BIT and

Article 5 (1) of the France BIT respectively.

For the purpose of establishing the date of the first breach of both BITs as regards
unlawful expropriation by the Respondent, as a completed act, the Tribunal determines
that breach as occurring on 25 June 2001 with the Secretariat’s decree ordering the

Requisition.

PART IX: ISSUE E - PROTECTION AND SECURITY

INTRODUCTION

In this part of the Award the Tribunal considers the Claimants’ claims that the

Respondent failed to accord to their investments “full legal protection” and “full and

complete protection and security” in accordance with the requirements of Article 3(2) of

the Argentina BIT and Article 4(3) of the France BIT respectively.

The provisions relating to ‘protection’ in the Argentina BIT and the France BIT

respectively provide as follows:

Argentina BIT

“ARTICLE 3. National Treatment and
Most Favoured Nation Treatment

[J

2.- Each Contracting Party, after

admitting in its territory investments from
investors of the other Contracting Party,
shall provide full legal protection to those
investors and their investments and shall
grant them a treatment no less favourable
than that granted to investors and
investments of its own investors or
investors from third States.

[J

France BIT

“ARTICLE 4
Protection and Treatment of Investments

[...

3. Investments made by investors of one
Contracting Party within the territory or
the maritime zone of the other Contracting
Party shall benefit from full and complete
protection and security within the territory
and maritime zone.

THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

The Claimants submit that the scope of these provisions extends beyond protection from
physical violence and threats and “incorporate[s] a broader requirement to protect the
position of investors and their investments”, referring to certain legal materials in

support of their position, including the following (Memorial at 121-23):

“370. In CME v Czech Republic, the arbitral tribunal found that the obligation
in the relevant BIT to provide full security and protection had been
violated certain [sic] acts of a government regulatory authority. It stated
that:

‘The Media Council’s actions in 1996 and its actions and inactions
in 1999 were targeted to remove the security and legal protection
of the Claimants’ investment in the Czech Republic. . . . The host
State is obligated to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws
nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and
approved security and protection of the foreign investor’s
investment withdrawn or devalued. This is not the case. The
Respondent is therefore in breach of this obligation.’

371. In Goetz v Burundi, the arbitral tribunal found that the withdrawal of a
free zone certificate by the State could constitute a measure having similar
effect to depriving investors of or restricting their use of property, since it
had forced the claimants to halt their activities and deprived them of the
benefit which they could have expected from their investment. The tribunal
observed that:

‘under the terms of Article 4 of the Treaty a measure depriving of
or restricting property or a measure having similar effect is legal
under international law once certain conditions are fulfilled. It is
only when one of these conditions is found not to be satisfied that
the host State can be regarded as having contravened its
international obligations under the Treaty and, more especially,

having breached its obligation, set out in Article 3, to ensure the
‘constant security . . . and protection of investors from the other
party’.’

   

372. The Goetz tribunal observed that if Burundi failed to provide the
indemnity required under the BIT:

Part IX — Page 2

9-4

“The international responsibility of the Burundian State would
therefore be triggered both for the violation of the obligation . . . to
abstain from taking any measure having a similar effect to a
measure depriving of or restricting property and for violation of
the obligation, set out in Article 3, to assure Belgian in

on its territory ‘constant security and ... protection’.”

The Goetz tribunal concluded that in order to adhere to its international
duties under the relevant BIT, Burundi had either to give an effective and
adequate indemnity in order to render the revocation lawful under the
relevant BIT provision, or, if it preferred, terminate the decision to
withdraw the free zone certificate. There was no suggestion in Goetz v
Burundi of any violence or threat of violence against the claimants’
investment.

373. The case of Rankin v Iran before the Iran-US Claims Tribunal also
supports the view that the obligation to provide full and complete
protection and safety is not limited to protection from physical violence. In
that case, the Tribunal held that anti-American statements attributable to
Tran “were inconsistent with the requirements of the Treaty of Amity and
customary international law to accord protection and security to
foreigners and their property.’

[J

375. And in Occidental v Ecuador, the Arbitral Tribunal recognised that a
violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard of the relevant BIT
also gave rise to a breach of the obligation of full protection and security
in the same provision of the BIT:

“a treatment that is not fair and equitable automatically entails

absence of full protection and security of the investment”.
[The Claimants’ emphasis; footnotes omitted.]

The Claimants add in their Reply that this legal approach was confirmed by the award

in Azurix v. Argentina Republic, as follows:

“[Full protection and security] is not only a matter of physical security;
the stability afforded by a secure investment environment is as important
from an investor’s point of view ... when the terms “protection and
security” are qualified by “full” and no other adjective or explanation,
they extending [sic] their ordinary meaning, the content of this standard
beyond physical security.”

Part IX — Page 3

9-5

9-6

(03)

9-7

The Claimants submit that, against this legal background, “the acts and omissions of
Mexico [...] undermined the stability of the investment environment in which they had
to operate and frustrated their legitimate expectations” thereby giving rise to an
independent violation of the Respondent’s obligations to accord full and complete
protection and safety under Article 4(3) of the France BIT and under Article 3(2) of the
Argentina BIT (Memorial at 123).

The Claimants conclude in connection with this claim as follows (Reply at 129):

“299. Nothing in the French or Argentina BITs explicitly limits the full
protection and security standard to the level of police protection required
under customary international law. In the present case, the Respondent’s
unjustified interference with the operation of the Concession by Renave —
commencing with the unilateral extension of the deadline for the
registration of used vehicles through to the revocation of the Concession —
undermined the stability of the environment in which the Concession
operated, frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations, and thereby
violated the standards of protection guaranteed to investors under Article
4.3 of the French BIT and Article 3.2 of the Argentina BIT.”

[Footnotes omitted.]

THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

The Respondent submits that arguments relating to ‘protection and security’ must not be
compared with those concerning FET standards under the BITs (Counter-Memorial at

151-152):

“510. The concepts of full protection and security refer to the State’s obligation
to afford protection to the person or property of a foreign national in
situations of threatened harm by third persons such as civil conflict or
some other disturbance. Tribunals have held that States are bound to a
due diligence standard in the circumstances. An example of the kind of

Part IX - Page 4

Sil.

circumstances that have been considered to attract State responsibility
due to its failure to accord full protection and security is found in Asian
Agricultural Products Limited v. Republic of Sri Lanka. In that case, the
Claimant’s shrimp farm was located in an area of Sri Lanka that had
come under the control of Tamil insurgents. During a counter insurgency
operation conducted by government security forces, the farm was
destroyed and its manager and staff members were killed. It was unclear
whether the damage was caused by government forces or rebels. The
majority of the tribunal found that the security forces could have taken
precautionary measures even though they suspected that some of the farm
employees were affiliated with the insurgents and for that reason found
the Respondent liable for failing to provide full protection and security.

The Tribunal rejected that the claimant’s argument that full protection
and security must be read broadly:

46. The Tribunal is of the opinion that the claimant’s construction of
Article 2(2) as explained herein-above cannot be justified under
any of the canons of interpretation previously stated (supra,
Section 40).

47. In conformity with Rule (B), the words “shall enjoy full protection
and security” have to be construed according to the “common use
which custom has affixed” to them, their “usus loquendi”,
“natural and obvious sense”, and “fair meaning.”

In fact, similar expressions, or even stronger wordings like the
“most constant protection”, were utilized since last century in a
number of bilateral treaties concluded to encourage the flow of
international economic exchanges and to provide the citizens and
national companies established on the territory of the other
Contracting Party with adequate treatment for them as well as to
their property (“Traité d’Amitié, de Commerce et Navigation”,
concluded between France and Mexico on November 27, 1886-cf.
A Ch. Kiss Répertoire de la Pratique Frangaise ..., op.cit., Tome
III, 1965 Section 1002, p. 637; The Treaty concluded in 1861
between Italy and Venezuela, the interpretation of which became
the central issue on the Sambiaggio case adjudicated in 1903 by
the Italy/Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission-U.N. Reports
International Arbitral Awards, vol. X, p. 512 ss.)

48. The arbitral Tribunal is not aware of any case in which the
obligation assumed by the host State to provide the nationals of the
other Contracting State with “full protection and security” was
construed as absolute obligation [sic] which guarantees that no
damages will be suffered, in the sense that any violation thereof

 

Part IX - Page 5

9-8

creates automatically a “strict liability” on behalf of the host
State.

512. The tribunal then referred to ELSI, where among the claims presented to
the Chamber was one where the United States complained that the
unlawful occupation of the manufacturing plant at issue by striking
workers had been permitted by Italy had permitted [sic] contrary to its
obligation to provide full protection and security commented:

In its Judgment of July 20, 1989, the ICJ Chamber clearly stated
that:

The reference in Article V to the provision of “constant protection
and security” cannot be construed as the giving of a warranty that
property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or
disturbed (C.I.J., Recueil, 1989, Section 109, p. 65).

Consequently, both the oldest reported arbitral precedent and the
latest ICJ ruling confirms that the language imposing on the host
State an obligation to provide “protection and security” or “full
protection and security by international law” (the other expression
included in the same Article V) could not be construed according
to the natural and ordinary sense of the words as creating a “strict
liability”. The rule remains that:

The state into which an alien has entered ... is not an insurer or a
guarantor of his security ... It does not, and could hardly be asked
to, accept an absolute responsibility for all injuries to foreigners
(Alwyn V. Freeman, Responsibility of states for Unlawful Acts of
Their Armed Forces, Sijthoff, Leiden, 1957, p. 14.)

This conclusion, arrived at more than three decades ago, still
reflects in the Tribunal’s opinion — the present state of
International Law Investment Standards as reflected in “the
worldwide BIT network”...”

[Footnotes omitted.]

The Respondent concludes that this allegation of breach of the BITs by the Claimants is
merely “a make-weight” and duplicative argument advanced in relation to their cases on

Expropriation and the FET standards (Rejoinder at 86).

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal considers that the two BIT provisions relating to the Respondent’s
obligation to provide ‘protection’ are materially similar for the purposes of the present
case, despite their different wording and different scope (the Argentina BIT referring to

investors and investments; and the France BIT referring to investments only).

Such ‘protection’ provisions, in the form of the wording here under consideration, do
not generally impose strict liability on a host state under international law; and the mere
fact of other unlawful conduct in the form of expropriation or inequitable and unfair
treatment by the host state is not, without more, to be treated as a breach of these

provisions.

The Tribunal also considers that these BIT provisions are directed at different kinds of
unlawful treatment from that proscribed by other provisions of the two BITs,
particularly those regarding FET and Expropriation. The latter involve the investor and
the host state, whereas the ‘protection’ provisions also involve the host state protecting

the investment from a third party.

In the Tribunal’s determination, this was never a case about a failure by the Respondent
(including the Secretariat) to afford physical or other like protection to the Claimants.
Moreover, the harm alleged by the Claimants is attributed to the Respondent itself and
not to any third party; and the existence of the many legal proceedings involving the
Concession and the Concessionaire, recorded in Part IV (28) above, demonstrate that it
was also never a case about a failure by the Respondent to afford, indirectly, legal
protection to the Claimants or their investments under Mexican law within the Mexican
legal system. It is clear that the Concessionaire was itself entitled to resort and did resort
to domestic legal remedies in the Respondent’s state courts; and the Claimants have

advanced no pleaded case in these arbitration proceedings for denial of justice.

Part IX - Page 7

9-13 In conclusion, on the facts found earlier in this Award, the Tribunal decides that the
Respondent has not breached Article 3(2) of the Argentine BIT (“full legal protection’)

or Article 4(3) of the France BIT (“full and complete protection and security”).

(05) THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

9-14 Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants have
not established any breach of the two BIT’s ‘protection’ provisions; and these claims
are therefore dismissed by the Tribunal. (In any event, these claims, even if any were
successful, would add nothing to the Tribunal’s overall decisions on liability, causation

and quantum in this Award).

PART X: ISSUE F —- NLF/MFN TREATMENT

INTRODUCTION

In this part of the Award, the Tribunal considers the Claimants’ submissions that the

Respondent is precluded from relying on the ‘national security’ proviso in Article 2(5)

of the Argentina BIT in regard to Talsud’s claims as a result of the ‘most favoured

nation treatment’ provision in Article 3(2) of that BIT and the terms of the France BIT

(which contain no ‘national security’ proviso).

The provisions relating to ‘no less favourable’ treatment and to ‘most favoured nation’

treatment in the Argentina BIT and the France BIT (“NLF/MFN’”) provide, respectively,

as follows:

Argentina BIT

“ARTICLE 3. National Treatment and
Most Favoured Nation Treatment

[ou]

2- Each Contracting Party, after
admitting in its territory investments from
investors of the other Contracting Party,
shall provide full legal protection to those
investors and their investments and shall
grant them a treatment no less favorable
than that granted to investors and
investments of its own investors or
investors from third States. [...]”

France BIT

“ARTICLE 4
Protection and treatment of Investments

[ou]

2. Each of the Contracting Parties shall
grant, within its territory and its maritime
zone, to investors of the other Contracting
Party a treatment no less favourable than it
would grant its own investors or treatment
granted to investors of the most favoured
Nation, if the latter is more favourable,
with regard to their investments and the
operation, administration, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposition of such
investments. [...]”

Part X — Page 1

10-3

(02)

Article 2(5) of the Argentina BIT further provides as follows:

“ARTICLE 2 Scope of Application

[ou]

5. - This Agreement shall not apply to:

[.-]
b) measures adopted by a Contracting Party for reasons of national
security or public order.”

THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

The Claimants’ position is first pleaded as follows (Memorial at 125):

“380. These provisions provide benefits to each of the Claimants. For example,

381.

Article 3.2 [of the Argentina BIT] operates to ensure that Talsud is
entitled to the standard of treatment provided in the Argentina BIT to the
full extent that that BIT does not incorporate a national security exception.
Thus, Mexico is precluded from relying on Article 2.5 of the Argentina BIT
to avoid the applicability of the Argentina BIT to Talsud’s investment and
to that company’s rights to invoke that BIT in these proceedings.

Arbitral tribunals have confirmed that investors may rely on most
favoured nation (MFN) provisions in a BIT to claim more favorable
treatment, where such treatment is provided under another BIT to which
the host state is a party. For example, in Maffezini v Italy [sic], the
claimant sought to rely upon an MFN provision in the Argentina-Spain
BIT to avoid a requirement in that BIT to allow a period of eighteen
months for disputes to be settled by domestic courts prior to having
recourse to arbitration under the BIT. The claimant alleged that Spain had
entered into other BITs that required no such prior reference to domestic
courts, and claimed the more favourable treatment provided in those BITs.
The Tribunal found that

Part X — Page 2

“if a third-party treaty contains provisions for the settlement of
disputes that are more favourable to the protection of the
investor's rights and interests than those in the basic treaty, such
provisions may be extended to the beneficiary of the most favoured
nation clause as they are fully compatible with the ejusdem generis
principle.”

In the context of applying MFN treatment to the dispute settlement
provisions (as opposed to the substantive standards) of a BIT, the
Maffezini Tribunal identified certain limits arising from public policy
considerations. However, the Claimants submit that no such
considerations limit the application of MFN requirement in there
proceedings.

[Footnotes omitted]

10-5 In their Reply, the Claimants further submit that (Reply at 129-130):

“300. [...] in any event, it is not open to the Respondent to seek to invoke that

301.

provision [Article 2(5) of the Argentina BIT] against Talsud in the present
proceedings. There is no national security provision in the France BIT
and hence Talsud is entitled, by virtue of the MFN provision in Article 3.2
of the Argentina BIT, to claim the more favourable treatment available to
investors under the France BIT.

The Respondent's answer to these submissions is not clear. It states that
“(njational security issues in the sense of the 1998 Law arose in relation
to the failure to adequately protect the security of citizens’ personal
information [...]”. However, the Respondent does not address the
Claimants’ arguments on this issue in any detail, and for present purposes
it is the Claimants’ understanding that the Respondent is not seeking to
invoke Article 2.5 of the Argentina BIT in respect of Talsud’s claim. The
Claimants reserve the right to make further submissions on this issue
should the Respondent raise it at a later stage of these proceedings,
however. At this stage the Claimants would simply note that the
Respondent's invocation of a national security argument has always been
unsustainable, and that it is all the more so following the report of
Mexican court-appointed expert [sic] which addresses not national
security but the security of Renave’s data handling systems. In his opinion
Ing. Vasquez states that “the level of security implemented [by the
Concessionaire] corresponds to level B2”, and he determines that no
changes were made during to the level of security [sic] during or after the
technical or administrative interventions. He concludes:

“the level of security established by the Concessionary during the
technical and administrative interventions was adequate for the

type of information and services being provided.”

Part X — Page 3

302. Notwithstanding that it does not advance any legal arguments based on
Article 2.5 of the Argentina BIT, the Respondent argues that the MFN
clause could not override a national security provision in a BIT. The
Claimants disagree. The Respondent’s suggestion that the public policy
nature of a national security provision precludes the application to it of
the MFN clause is undermined by the absence of such a provision from the
French BIT. The Claimants again reserve their rights to make further
submissions on this point should the Respondent seek to raise it at a later
stage.”

[Footnotes omitted]

(03) | THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

10-6 The Respondent submits principally that the MFN clause in the Argentina BIT cannot
override the public policy invocation of ‘national security’ in relation to the

Concessionaire (Counter-Memorial at 171):

“S81. The Claimants have advanced arguments based on an anticipated
invocation of the national security exception contained in the Argentina-
Mexico Treaty. National security issues in the sense of the 1998 Law
arose in relation to the failure to adequately protect the security of the
citizens’ personal information (this was noted in the requisition Acuerdo
of 25 June 2000 and has been subsequently confirmed by Mexican courts)
and the Concessionaire’s security lapses have already been addressed
both in the facts (including in the witness statement of Lic. Maria Jimena
Valverde Valdez).

 

582. | Mexico’s response to the Claimants’ submissions on the national security
clause is twofold. First, Mexico disagrees with the submission to the effect
that an MFN clause can override this provision of the Treaty. This clause
is a provision of a public policy nature which cannot be overridden by an
MEN clause. The Claimants acknowledge that limits on the MFN clauses
exist by virtue of public policy considerations (there are other reasons as
well). Mexico plainly disagrees with the contention that a national
security exception does not fall into the category of public policy and
therefore an MFN clause cannot override it. Second, Mexico’s response
to the Claimants’ contention that the threshold to be met for the invocation
of the national security exception is “extremely high” is that each

exception depends upon its own wording; some are plainly self-judging
and others are plainly not, while still others fall somewhere between the
two. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to address the Claimants’
contentions in further detail.”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal observes that the submissions advanced by the Claimants under the
Argentina BIT were, in fact, as was acknowledged by the Claimants themselves,
anticipatory of a defence which was ultimately never advanced by the Respondent in

these arbitration proceedings.

As Article 2(5) of the Argentina BIT has not been invoked by the Respondent, this Issue
F remains entirely moot. It is therefore unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide it in these

arbitration proceedings.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

As the ‘national security’ provision in Article 2(5) of the Argentina BIT was never
invoked by the Respondent as a defence to Talsud’s claim, no decision in respect of the
Claimants’ submissions is required of the Tribunal, save to dismiss them as otiose in

these arbitration proceedings.

In so dismissing the Claimant’s submissions, the Tribunal wishes to make it explicitly
clear that it is not here making any decision on the other merits or demerits of the

Parties’ respective submissions as regards this Issue F.

PART XI: ISSUE G- CAUSATION AND FAULT

INTRODUCTION

In this part of the Award, the Tribunal considers issues of causation and fault, on the

basis that the Claimants have established (i) a breach of the FET standards in both BITs

comprising of both the Requisition on 25 June 2001 and the Revocation on 13 December

2002; and (ii) a breach of the expropriation provisions in both BITs comprising also of

both the Requisition and the Revocation.

The provisions relating to causation in the Argentina BIT and the France BIT

respectively provide as follows:

Argentina BIT

“Article 10. Dispute Settlement between an
Investor and the Contracting Party which
has received the Investment

[J

6.- The arbitration award shall be limited
to determining whether a Contracting Party
has breached this Agreement, whether this
breach has caused a loss to the investor
and, if so:-

a) ‘fix the amount of
compensatory indemnification for
the damage suffered;

b) restitution of property or, if that is
not possible, the corresponding
compensatory indemnification ...”

France BIT
“Article 9

Resolution of Disputes between an
Investor of one of the Contracting Parties
and the other Contracting Party

1. This Article only applies to disputes
between one Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party in
relation to an alleged breach by the
Contracting Party under this Agreement
which causes loss or damage to the
investor or his investment ...”.

' MTD Equity Sdn, Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile (ICSID Case No. ARB/O1/7), Award of 25 May

2004.

The Claimants submit that they have suffered loss as a result of the Respondent’s actions,
identifying in particular “acts of expropriation”, the failure to provide fair and equitable
treatment, and the failure to provide full protection and security (Memorial, para. 382 at

126). In this regard, the Claimants submit that the Respondent is solely responsible for

THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

their loss.

The Claimants reject the proposition that they contributed to their losses and the corollary
notion that any compensation awarded should accordingly be reduced or entirely

extinguished, on the ground that Mr Cavallo was a senior employee of the

Concessionaire.

The MTD award! cited by the Respondent in support of this proposition is distinguished

by the Claimants (Quan. Rep. 40-41):

“90.

The present situation is entirely different. The Claimants were not
negligent or unwise when they appointed Mr Cavallo. Mr Taiariol and Mr
Siegrist have already dealt with these allegations in their witness
statements. The Respondent has introduced no evidence in the merits
phase to support the proposition that the Claimants knew or could have
known the background events in issue. Mr Cavallo had successfully
managed Talsud projects in Mendoza and Godoy Cruz. In recognition of
his efforts he became a Director of Talsud in 1995. His technical training
and practical experience with concessions similar to Renave made him
the obvious choice to manage Renave. His curriculum vitae was
accordingly submitted to Mexico as part of the bid process in 1999. The
Renave shareholders were not aware of the alleged criminal activity of
Mr Cavallo in the late 1970s or early 1980s and were no better placed
than Mexico to make enquiries about his past life in military service in
Argentina. This is not a case of someone being introduced who did not
have the requisite skills and qualifications. The accusations made against
Mr Cavallo are wholly extraordinary and so far at the extreme of the

Part XI - Page 2

unexpected that it is unreasonable to lay blame for the fact that they did
not come to light at an earlier stage.

91. In addition, the events surrounding the arrest of Mr Cavallo in August
2000 should have no bearing on the Claimants’ loss. The project could
have continued to operate successfully and profitably and in respect of
new vehicles did so until December 2002, long after the events in
question. Used vehicle operations were postponed on 21 August 2000,
before the arrest of Mr Cavallo. It is the Respondent’s actions only that
caused the Claimants’ loss.

92. The Respondent is therefore solely responsible for the loss caused to the
Claimants and cannot invoke any contributory negligence.”

[Footnotes omitted]

(03) THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

11.6. The Respondent contends that Article 39 of the ILC draft Articles on State Responsibility

“should preclude any recovery” in this case because the Claimants contributed to any

injury suffered (Rejoinder at 70-71):

“245. The recent annulment committee decision in MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd and
MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile (“MTD”) upheld that tribunal’s use
of the principle of contributory fault. The committee noted that the ILC’s
Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts
stated at Article 39:

Contribution to the injury

In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the
contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission
of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom
reparation is sought.

246. The Committee noted that although Article 39 falls within the part of the
ILC Articles on diplomatic protection, “[t]here is no reason [not] to apply
the same principle of contribution to claims for breach of treaty brought
by individuals.”

Part XI - Page 3

247. In Mexico’s respectful submission, the evidence, viewed objectively,
points to a single event - entirely of Talsud’s own making - namely, the
appointment of Mr. Cavallo, which had the effect of undermining the
entire project. Mexico does not dispute that the project faced other
difficulties, however, whatever prospects it had for its public acceptance
and viability were destroyed by the Cavallo scandal. Applying Article 39,
this should preclude any recovery. It was the event that initiated the entire
chain of events that damaged the Registry, the Concessionaire and the
Secretariat.”

[Footnotes Omitted]

11.7. The Respondent’s position in its quantum submissions appears less categorical. The
Respondent submits that any award of damages should be reduced by half to account for

the Claimants’ contributory fault (Quan. CM at 30):

“114. Mexico’s Rejoinder noted the MTD annulment committee’s embrace of
that tribunal’s use of the rule of contributory fault. It is Mexico’s position
that were there to be any award of damages, such award should be further
discounted by at least 50% on the basis of contributory fault. The venture,
which was facing serious problems before 24 August 2000, faced
insurmountable problems thereafter.

115. Those problems stemmed from Talsud’s appointment of Mr. Cavallo to the
highest managerial position in Renave. Gemplus, Henry Davis Signoret
and Talsud agreed to give Talsud the right to appoint the General
Director. Mr. Cavallo was Talsud’s choice, not Mexico’s, and Talsud and
its co-venturer Gemplus must bear the consequences.”

(04) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

11.8. It is clear under international law that compensation for violation of a BIT will only be

due from a respondent state if there is a sufficient causal link between the treaty breach
by that state and the loss sustained by the claimant; and here the two BITs expressly refer

to ‘causation’: see above.

Part XI - Page 4

11.9. As to causation generally, it is here, as elsewhere in this Award, useful to refer the ILC’s
draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. Article 31 of
the ILC’s draft Articles states that a responsible state is obliged to make full reparation

for the injury “caused by the intentionally wrongful act of a State”.
11.10. The ILC’s Commentary on Article 31° states:

“(10) ... Various terms are used to describe the link which must exist
between the wrongful act and the injury in order for the obligation of
reparation to arise. For example, reference may be made to losses
‘attributable [to the wrongful act] as a proximate cause’, or to damage
which is ‘too indirect, remote, and uncertain to be appraised’, or to ‘any
direct loss, damage, including environmental damage and the depletion of
natural resources, or injury to foreign Governments, nationals and
corporations as a result of’ the wrongful act. This causality in fact is a
necessary but not a sufficient condition of reparation. There is a further
element, associated with the exclusion of injury that is too ‘remote’ or
‘consequential’ to be the subject of reparation. In some cases, the
criterion of ‘directness’ may be used, in others ‘foreseeability’ or
‘proximity’. But other factors may also be relevant: for example, whether
State organs deliberately caused the harm in question, or whether the
harm caused was within the ambit of the rule which was breached, having
regard to the purpose of that rule. In other words, the requirement of a
causal link is not necessarily the same in relation to every beach of an
internati l obligati In inter i las in i ! law, the q i
of remoteness of damage ‘is not a part of the law which can be
satisfactorily solved by search for a single verbal formula’. The notion of
a sufficient causal link which is not too remote is embodied in the general
requirement in article 31 that the injury should be in consequence of the
wrongful act, but without the addition of any particular qualifying
phrase.”

 

[Footnote omitted]

11.11. In the Tribunal’s view, these general principles as to causation are not materially in issue
on the facts of the present case. As determined by the Tribunal, on the facts found by the
Tribunal earlier in this Award, the particular question here is whether the claims for
compensation advanced by the Claimants, or more particularly Talsud, should, as a
matter of causation or analogous principle, be extinguished or partially reduced because

the Claimants associated themselves with and appointed Mr Cavallo as _ the

> J. Crawford, The International Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (CUP, 2002), p.204.

Part XI - Page 5

Concessionaire’s General Director, as the material factor which triggered or substantially

contributed to the Claimants’ injuries.

11.12. Article 39 of the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility precludes full or any recovery,
where, through the wilful or negligent act or omission of the claimant state or person, that
state or person has contributed to the injury for which reparation is sought from the
respondent state. The ILC’s Commentary on Article 39 refers to like concepts in national
laws referred to as “contributory negligence”, “comparative fault”, “‘faute de la victime”
etc. The common feature of all these national legal concepts is, of course, a fault by the
claimant which has caused or contributed to the injury which is the subject-matter of the

claim; and such a fault is synonymous with a form of culpability and not any act or

omission falling short of such culpability.

11.13. This interpretation of Article 39 is confirmed by the ILC Commentary. It states, in
Paragraph 39(5):
“Not every action or omission which contributes to the damage suffered is
relevant for this purpose. Rather article 39 allows to be taken into account
only those actions or omissions which can be considered as wilful or
negligent, i.e. which manifest a lack of due care on the part of the victim of
the breach for his or her own property or rights ...”. “It follows that
something which is not wilful, negligent or otherwise culpable falls
outwith the principle expressed in Article 39. v3
11.14. The Tribunal determines that none of the Claimants knew or could reasonably have
known of Mr Cavallo’s past (assuming even, for present purposes, that his past is as was
alleged by the Respondent). It was certainly not known at the material time by the
Respondent itself, which (as a state) had privileged access to the Government of
Argentina and, having made an appropriate inquiry to Argentina before granting the
Concession to the Concessionaire, received an anodyne response as to Mr Cavallo’s
antecedents. If that little was achieved by the Respondent as a state receiving assistance
from a state, how much less could have become known by the Claimants. Indeed, it was
accepted by Counsel for the Respondent on the first day, and again on the final day, of

the main hearing that the Claimants did not and could not have known of the criminal

* Ibid, p. 241.

Part XI - Page 6

allegations made against Mr Cavallo [D1:230 and D8:1680]. In short, there is no

culpability attaching to the Claimants.

11.15. In the Tribunal’s view, these facts suffice to demonstrate the absence of any fault by any
of the Claimants; and, without such fault, this defence advanced by the Respondent must

fail in its entirety on the facts of the present case.

(05) THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

11.16. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent caused the losses suffered by
the Claimants as assessed later in this Award, without any reduction for “contributory

negligence” or other fault, as alleged by the Respondent.

PART XII: ISSUE H - COMPENSATION: GENERAL APPROACH

INTRODUCTION

In this part of the Award, the Tribunal considers the general legal principles applicable to

an award of compensation under the two BITs and international law, as approached by

the Claimants and the Respondent respectively.

The Argentina BIT and the France BIT provide as follows as regards “Expropriation and

Indemnification”:

“Argentina BIT
Article 5

5.1. — Neither of the Contracting Parties
may nationalize or expropriate, either
directly or indirectly, an investment of an
investor of the other Contracting Party in
its territory or adopt any measures
equivalent to the expropriation or
nationalization of that investment, except:

a) for reasons of public utility;

b) on a non-discriminatory basis;

c) in accordance with due process; and

d) with indemnification, pursuant to
paragraphs (2) through (4).

2. — The indemnification shall be
equivalent to the market value of the
expropriated — in liately
before the expropriatory measure was

“France BIT

Article 5

5.1. Neither Contracting Party shall
nationalize or expropriate directly or

indirectly, or take any other measure of
equivalent effect, with respect to an
investment of the other Contracting Party
in its territory or its maritime zone,
except:

(i) for reasons of public interest;

(ii) provided that such measures are non-
discriminatory;

(iii) in accordance with due process;

(iv) on payment of indemnification in
accordance with the provisions of
paragraphs 2 and 3 of this Article.

2. Inde ‘ation shall be paid without
delay, shall be freely transferable and

12-3

implemented. The valuation criteria shall
include current value, declared tax value of
tangible goods, and other criteria that are
appropriate to determine market value.

3. — Indemnification shall be paid without
delay, fully realizable and __ freely
transferable.

4. — The amount paid shall be no less than
the equivalent amount which would have
been paid as indemnification on the date of
expropriation in a_ freely-convertible
currency on the international financial
market, that currency having been
converted to the standard market quotation
on the date of valuation, plus interest
corresponding to a reasonable commercial
rate for that currency until the date of
payment.”

fully realizable.

3. The indemnification shall be equivalent
to the fair market value or, in the absence
of such value, to the actual value of the
expropriated or nationalized investment
immediately before the expropriation or
nationalization was carried out and shall
not reflect any changes in the value which
arise as a result of the expropriation
becoming known prior to the date of
expropriation. Valuation criteria shall
include going concern value, asset value
including the declared tax value of
tangible property and any other criteria
which, in the circumstances, are
appropriate to determine fair market
value. The aforementioned
indemnification, its amount and its mode
of payment shall be fixed no later than the
date of deprivation. Indemnification will
be subject to interest calculated at the
applicable market rate until the date of
payment.”

These measures of indemnification relate, under both BITs, to lawful expropriation and

do not expressly address compensation for unlawful expropriation by the Respondent, as

decided by the Tribunal above in Part VIII of this Award. Neither BIT provides expressly

for any separate measure of compensation in respect of breach of the BITs’ FET

standards, as decided by the Tribunal in Part VII above. (The Tribunal returns to these

features later below).

THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

The Claimants submit that the market value measure of compensation in Article 5 of both
BITs is consistent with the standard expressed in most other treaties and under customary

international law, especially the decisions in Chorzéw Factory! (Quan. Mem. at 11).

In Chorzéw Factory, the Permanent Court of International Justice expressed the general
principle of compensation as reparation as follows: “Reparation must, as far as possible,
wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which

would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.”

According to the Claimants, the general principle in Chorzéw Factory has been recently
followed in Compania de Aguas del Aconquija & Vivendi v. Argentina’ (Quan. Rep. at 5,
para. 9):

“There can be no doubt about the vitality of [the Chorzéw Factory]
statement of the damages standard under customary international law,
which has been affirmed and applied by numerous international tribunals
as well as the PCIJ’s successor, the International Court of Justice. It is
also clear that such a standard permits, if the facts so require, a higher
rate of recovery than prescribed in [the BIT] for lawful expropriations.”

The Claimants contend that this standard, which includes (in their submission) the
potential to recover lost profits, is now codified in the ILC’s draft Articles on State

Responsibility (Quan. Rep. at 5; Quan. Mem. at 11-12):

“11. As provided in Article 31(1) of the International Law Commissions’ Draft
Articles on State Compensation [sic], the responsible state “is under an
obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the
internationally wrongful act.” Full reparation includes “an obligation to
compensate for the damages caused thereby; insofar as such damage is
not made good by restitution.” In a case such as this, where the value of a
business is reflected largely in its income stream (here backed up by a
legal obligation for all vehicles to be registered), this is particularly

' Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzéw (Germany v. Poland), 1927 PCI, Series A, No 9 (Jurisdiction); 1928
PCJ, Series A, No 17 (Merits) [hereinafter Chorzéw Factory].

> Compania de Aguas de Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Republic of Argentina (ICSID Case No.
ARB/97/3), Award of 25 July 2007, para. 8.2.5.

Part XII — Page 3

relevant. Lost profits are to be awarded because reparation would
otherwise not “wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act.” [...]”

“31. Likewise, under Article 36 (Compensation) of the International Law
Commission's Guideline on the Responsibility of States for Internationally
Wrongful Acts:

“dL. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under
an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby,
insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution.

2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage
including loss of profits insofar as it is established.”

32. These principles lead to a two fold obligation: first, the obligation to
restore the property in question or, if this is not possible, to pay
compensation corresponding to its value. Second, there is an obligation to
pay de for any additional losses ined as ac q ce of the
taking.”

The Claimants refer the Tribunal to Mr Brower’s concurring opinion in the Iran-U.S.
Claims Tribunal case of Amoco International Finance (amongst other legal materials) as

to the scope of compensation under this standard (Quan. Mem. at 15-16, para. 39):

“[...] Chorzéw Factory presents a simple scheme: If an expropriation is
lawful, the deprived party is to be awarded damages equal to “the value of
the undertaking” which it has lost, including any potential future profits,
as of the date of taking; in the case of an unlawful taking, however, either
the injured party is to be actually restored to enjoyment of his property,
or, should this be impossible or impractical, he is to be awarded damages
equal to the greater of (i) the value of the undertaking at the date of loss
(again including lost profits), judged on the basis of information available
as of that date, and (ii) its value (likewise including lost profits) as shown
by its probable performance subsequent to the date of loss and prior to the
date of the award, based on actual post-taking experience, plus (in either
alternative) any consequential damages. Apart from the fact that this is
what Chorzéw Factory says, it is the only set of principles that will
guarantee just compensation to all expropriated parties.

[.-]
The substantive text of the judgment in Chorzéw Factory is consonant with

the conclusion that the “value of the undertaking” includes its potential
for earning profits. The Court thus described such value as including ‘the

Part XII — Page 4

cessation of the working and the loss of profits which have accrued’; [...]
and as embracing ‘the worth of the enterprise as a whole’ or ‘the total
value of the undertaking’ including ‘profit’.”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-9 The Claimants further refer to the recent ICSID awards in LG&E v. Argentina and Enron
v. Argentina (Quan. Rep. at 36-37):

“76. [...] In LG&E the Tribunal concluded that “the appropriate standard for
reparation under international law is “full” reparation as set out by the
Permanent Court of International Justice in the Chorzéw Factory case
and as codified in Article 31 of the International Law Commission Draft
Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the
Draft Articles or DARS).” It concluded that the tribunal had to assess the
“actual loss’ suffered by the investor ‘as a result’ of Argentina’s

conduct”, or the “compensation [...] that Claimants would have received

but for Argentina’s breaches [less those dividends] that were actually
received by Claimants.”

77. The Enron Tribunal reached a similar conclusion when assessing the
standard of compensation for breach of the obligations to accord the
investor the fair and equitable treatment as guaranteed by Article II(2)(a)
of the Argentina-USA BIT and to observe the obligations entered into with
regard to the investment guaranteed in Article II(2)(c) of the Argentina-
USA BIT. The tribunal ruled that “the appropriate standard of reparation
under international law is compensation for the losses suffered by the
affected party, as was established by the Permanent Court of International
Justice in the Chorzéw Case.” It concluded that “the appropriate
approach in the instant case is that of compensation for the difference in
the ‘fair market value’ of the investment resulting from the treaty
breaches.” As to the distinction between the standard for expropriation
and the standard for other breaches, the Tribunal stated that:

“On occasions, the line separating indirect expropriation from the
breach of fair and equitable treatment can be rather thin and in
those circumstances the standard of compensation can also be
similar on one or the other side of the line. Given the cumulative
nature of the breaches that have resulted in a finding of liability,
the Tribunal believes that in this case it is appropriate to apply the
fair market value to the determination of compensation.”

  

78. The Tribunal went on to say that:

“The Tribunal is not persuaded by the use of book value or unjust
enrichment in this case because these methodologies do not

Part XII — Page 5

provide an adequate tool for estimating the market value of TGS’s
stake. The book value of TGS stake [sic] is by definition valid for
accounting purposes but, as noted by LECG, fails to incorporate
the expected performance of the firm in the future. The unjust
enrichment method does not provide a value of the company; it
computes damages by looking at the extent of unfair enrichment by
the Government. The estimation of the unfair enrichment would
then be determined on the basis of the price paid for the license or
the wealth transferred to the entity benefiting from the enrichment.

[ou]

In view of the fact that TGS is a “going concern”, the Tribunal
believes that its fair market value should include the measure of its
future prospects.

Since DCF reflects the companies’ capacity to generate positive
returns in the future, it appears as the appropriate method to value
a “going concern” such as TGS. Moreover, there is convincing
evidence that DCF is a sound tool used internationally to value
companies, albeit that it is to be used with caution as it can give
rise to speculation. It has also been constantly used by tribunals in
establishing fair market value of assets to determine compensation
of breaches of international law.”””

[Footnotes omitted]

12-10 The Claimants submit that whilst lost profits are not a necessary element in determining
the market value of shares, they are commonly provided for as an element of
compensation in other contractual contexts, including the UN Convention on Contracts

for the International Sale of Goods and the UNIDROIT Principles (Quan. Rep. at 6):

“13. [...] Article 14 states: “Damages for breach of contract by one party
consist of a sum equal to the loss, including loss of profit, suffered by the
other party as a consequence of the breach.” This is reflected in the
UNIDROIT principles, which state at article 7.4.2. that:

‘The aggrieved party is entitled to full compensation for harm
suffered as a result of the non-performance. Such harm includes
both any loss which it suffered and_any gain of which it was
deprived, taking into account any gain to the aggrieved party
resulting from its avoidance of costs or harm.’”

[The Claimants’ emphasis]

Part XII — Page 6

12-11 The Claimants submit that, where an asset is not publicly traded and there is no open
market for the asset, its value must be established by reference to its “likely value in a
hypothetical market”. Relying primarily upon the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal’s decision in
Starrett Housing Corp. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, the Claimants contend that “the
market value of an untraded asset is” the “price that a willing buyer would pay to a
willing seller in circumstances in which each had good information, each desired to
maximize his financial gain, and neither was under duress or threat.’”

12-12 The Claimants contend that the World Bank has endorsed this approach in the Guidelines
on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment which define “market value” as (Quan.

Mem. at 17):

“an amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller
after taking into account the nature of the investment, the circumstances in
which it would operate in the future and its specific characteristics,
including the period in which it has been in existence, the proportion of
tangible assets in the total investment and other relevant factors pertinent
to the specific circumstances of each case.”

12-13 The Claimants rely upon the World Bank’s Guideline IV.4 for the proposition that “the

discounted cash flow method is the best method to establish the market value of a

business such as Renave” (Quan. Mem. at 19, para. 50):

“[w]ithout implying the exclusive validity of a single standard for the
fairness by which compensation is to be determined and as an illustration
of the reasonable determination by a State of the market value of the
investment under Section 5 above, such determination will be deemed
reasonable if conducted as follows:

(i) for a going concern with a proven record of profitability,
on the basis of the discounted cash flow value”
12-14 The Claimants contend that the ‘Income Approach’ method, which relies on a DCF

“4. In this case - as in many others with which the ICSID system has dealt - a
significant value of the business at the stage at which the unlawful
interference occurred was its future income stream. Recent ICSID and
other awards have accepted the principle that in such circumstances the
DCF approach is the one that is to be adopted, unless there are
compelling reasons for not doing so. The operative presumption is that
DCF provides the best and fairest means of assessing the value of the
rights or the property that have been subject to internationally unlawful
acts. That is why it is used so often. In the present case there is no reason
why that operative presumption should be displaced. The award of the
Concession that established a national monopoly was promoted by the
state and backed by legislation. As part of the Concession, vehicle
registration was a mandatory obligation so that the revenue projections
adopted in the Business Plan can be regarded as reliable and realistic.
The LECG/Horwath report makes clear that developments in Mexico’s
vehicle market since 1999 (when the Business Plan was formulated) show
that the projections in the Business Plan were conservative. There are
several years of established, verifiable data on which to base and then test
DCF assumptions. There is little that is speculative about the operation of
Renave over a period of several years. This is particularly true for new
vehicle registrations.”

12-15 The Claimants contend that international tribunals have frequently made use of this

approach* (Quan. Rep. at 8-9):

“17. [...] The CMS tribunal had “no hesitation in endorsing” the DCF method
as the most appropriate method in that case, further adding that “DCF
techniques have been universally adopted, including by numerous arbitral
tribunals, as an appropriate method for valuing business assets.” The
tribunal accepted that while the DCF method necessarily requires some
degree of estimation, such estimates need not be “arbitrary or analogous
to a shot in the dark; with the appropriate methodology and the use of
reasonable alternative sets of hypotheses, it is possible to arrive at figures
which represent a range of values which can be rationally justified [...].”

18. In ADC v. Hungary, the tribunal stated that “like many tribunals in cases
such as the present one, the Tribunal prefer [sic] to apply the DCF

* In their Quantum Memorial, the Claimants cite the following arbitral awards: Starrett Housing Corp. v. The
Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, 16 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 112, Final Award No. 314-24-1, 14 August 1987,

method.” The tribunal further noted that the expert valuer was “fully
justified” in adopting the DCF method.

 

19. The advantages of the DCF method have long been recognised. For
example, the AMCO tribunal noted that “the DCF method has been used
in appropriate international awards (e.g. Starrett and Phillips).” It
considered that “the DCF method is at once a flexible tool, that allows for
an application of factors and elements judged as relevant. At the same
time, it allows for the application of these judgmental elements to be
articulated.”

20. McLachlan, Shore and Weiniger have looked at the practice of
international tribunals and concluded as follows:

“Notwithstanding its difficulties, the DCF method is almost
universally used and accepted by both the business and the
academic community in valuing income-producing assets. The
value of an income-producing capital asset can only be
ascertained by valuing the cash the asset is expected to generate in
the future. The DCF method is thus appropriate because it is
designed to calculate the value on one specific date of cash flows
that are to be received at different times.”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-16 Thus, in the Claimants’ submission, this approach is the “only fair and proper way to

value” their loss in the present case (Quan. Rep. at 17-18):

“42. The LECG/Horwath approach is correct for a second reason:
international tribunals have used the DCF method where, as in the
present case, it is possible on the basis of verifiable data to predict the
income that would be generated by the investment. Tribunals have only
resorted to other techniques when it was not possible to use DCF because
the methodology was based on speculative assumptions or there was a
history of lack of profitability. As summarised by authors McLachlan,
Shore and Weiniger:

“Compensation under this [DCF] is not appropriate for
speculative or indeterminate damage, or for alleged profits which
cannot legitimately accrue under the laws and regulations of the
host country.”

43. In this case, there are clear reasons why the Tribunal can validly make
use of the DCF method:

Part XII — Page 9

12-17 The Claimants contend that the ‘jurisprudence’ relied upon by the Respondent in fact
supports their arguments that the DCF method is appropriate to value their investments in
the Concessionaire, submitting that those legal materials may be divided into two
categories: “(i) either the investment’s profitability was not evidenced and the DCF
method could therefore not be applied with sufficient certainty, or (ii) the tribunal

endorsed and used the DCF method to assess compensation, but altered (and reduced) the

(i) the damage is not speculative, and the facts and assumptions on
which LECG/Horwath rely are sufficiently certain to make such
an approach appropriate; and

(ii) the alternative valuation methods put forward by PRA (which
LECG/Horwath considered and rejected) do not allow Renave’s
key asset, namely its predictable income stream under the terms of
the Concession Agreement, to be taken into account, as referred to
in more detail below.”

[Footnotes omitted]

Claimant’s calculations” (Quan. Rep. at 30).

12-18 The Claimants submit that in refuting the applicability of the DCF method (Quan. Rep at

10-11):

“24. [...] Respondent draws a wholly artificial and untenable distinction

25,

between the track record as at the valuation date, as referred to above,
and the actual track record based on established facts. The Respondent's
approach is self-contradictory. The Respondent is happy to refer in the
Counter Memorial to new vehicle registrations which continued long
enough to permit Renave to generate funds to pay as dividends to its
investors, but it does not wish to refer to the same facts for the purposes of
valuing the investment. There is no dispute between the parties that about
2.2 million new vehicles were registered by Renave from inception up to
the Revocation of the Concession in December 2002. The Respondent
cannot say — and it does not say — that there was no track record. Rather,
it argues that the Tribunal should not look at how the investment actually
performed after the Respondent's initial and unlawful act of interference
in August 2000. The Respondent seeks, in effect, to rely on its own wrong-
doing to minimise the compensation that is due.

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s approach is ill-conceived
and should be rejected. There has been a widespread acceptance of lost
gain or loss of profit as a legitimate element for measuring the amount of
compensation that is due. The approach is supported by the terms of the

Part XII — Page 10

two BITs, which allow reference to be made to all appropriate criteria in
assessing compensation. In this case, it is accepted by all the parties that
there was no open market for the shares in Renave. As stated in the
Claimants’ First Memorial on Quantum, the Claimants’ experts proceed
on the basis that there was no existing business comparable to Renave
and there had been no arm’s-length transaction from which they derived
an estimate of Renave’s value. The parties are driven to the fiction of a
hypothetical buyer and seller by the terms of the BITs which equate
compensation with the market value of the investment. It does not follow
that the Tribunal should ignore what would otherwise be material,
accessible and verifiable information about the prospects for future profit.
The Respondent's approach is unrealistic and unfair and undermines the
intention of the drafters of the BITs and the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations as to how they would be interpreted and applied.

26. The artificiality of a valuation which ignores actual facts is recognised
both in the Respondent's Counter Memorial and the PRA Report. The
Counter Memorial refers to the “real world of commerce” and speculates
about the likelihood of “earn out” payments being made in a real
transaction. According to PRA, “a proper DCF valuation” would also
address factors such as the aftermath of the Cavallo arrest. However, at
the same time, the PRA Report seeks to limit various aspects of its
analysis to pre-valuation date data. Yet it fails to support the proposition
that reference to actual facts, including post-valuation data information,
is “not permitted” in terms of applicable principles of valuation theory or
practice.”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-19 The Claimants next assert that “[t]here is nothing out of the ordinary” in the approach
they have adopted in valuing their investments, particularly as regards the use of data

coming into existence after the relevant valuation date (Quan Rep. at 12):

“30. [...] In CMS, for instance, the Tribunal valued the investment as at 17
August 2000. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considered all relevant facts up
to the date of the award when assessing the value of the investment. The
CMS Tribunal notably took into account the actual GDP of Argentina:

“The Tribunal has concluded that it is reasonable to assume that
sales revenues would have decreased by 5% in each of 2002 and
2003 and by 1% in 2004. This would reflect the delayed impact of
the decline of the Argentina GDP in 2001 (-4.4%) and 2002 (-
10.9%), somewhat mitigated by the maintenance of the non-
pesofication of export revenues which continued in addition to be
adjusted to the PPI. On the other hand, in 2003 and 2004, the
Argentine GDP rose significantly, by 8.8% and 7.8% respectively.

Part XII — Page 11

It would be normal that that turnaround would manifest itself in an
increase in the industrial and residential demand for gas.
Moreover, there would have been, by the end of 2004, an excess
capacity of some 19% (6% original surplus capacity existing in
2001 plus 13% additional capacity created by the reduced demand
between 2002-2004). The Tribunal is of the view that gradual
increase in demand over the following years would have taken
place until full capacity would have been achieved in TGN’s
pipelines. The Tribunal has therefore forecasted an increase in
sales of 3% in 2011. This would allow for the full recuperation of
the excess capacity in the gas transportation system of TGN.
Thereafter, the sales would only increase by 1.5% each year under
the PPI formula.”

The tribunal awarded US$133.2 million to the Claimant based on a
discount rate of 14.5%.

31. Likewise, in CME v. Czech Republic the Tribunal took into account
relevant post valuation date facts. Although the valuation date was 5
August 1999, facts such as reports on advertising forecasts released in
September 1999 and 2001 and a media report dated July 2001 were taken
into account. The Tribunal also took into account the significant fact that
the Czech Republic renewed the television channel’s broadcasting
licence:

“The parties disputed the possibility that the Nova 12 years’
broadcasting license rendered to CET 21 in 1993 would not be
renewed at January 31, 2005. Rothschild for this alternative
suggested an implied enterprise value for CNTS as of August 5,
1999 at the amount of USD 114 million. The Tribunal cannot
accept this argument.

. CET 21's broadcasting license was meanwhile extended by
the media Council on January 22, 2002 by another ten
years until 2017 (CET 21 being purportedly under control
of Dr. Zelezny). [...]”

32. All relevant facts were also taken into account by the tribunals in SD
Myers and ADC v. Hungary.”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-20 The Claimants also submit that, in order to determine the amount of compensation in this
case, the Tribunal should exclude the effects of the taking itself and all acts related to the
taking which had an adverse impact on the value of the investments on the date of the

valuation, contending as follows (Quan. Mem. at 20-21):

Part XII — Page 12

“354. Both BITs envisage this as they provide for compensation valued
immediately before the first expropriatory acts or threat thereof. In
addition, the Mexico-France BIT specifically states that “compensation
[...] shall not take account of any changes in the value which arise as a
result of the expropriation becoming known prior to it taking place.”

55. This guiding principle of international law was applied by the tribunal in
Norwegian Shipowners’ Claims, which refused to value compensation
based on an artificial reduction of the value of the ships resulting from
governmental action.

56. This point has since been confirmed by numerous international tribunals.
For example, the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in Shahin Shaine Ebrahimi v.
The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, holding that “a
government cannot justify non-payment (or inadequate payment) for
valuable property on the ground that prospective buyers would have been
lacking because of the expropriation itself or the threat thereof.” Likewise,
in James M. Saghi v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, it held that “any
diminution of value caused by the deprivation of property itself should be
disregarded.”

57. In Starrett Housing Corporation v. The Government of the Islamic
Republic of Iran, the Tribunal noted that the effects of measures falling
within the category of acts of taking or threats of taking must be excluded
under international law in determining compensation for expropriated
property.

58. Similarly, the Tribunal in American International Group, Inc. v. The
Islamic Republic of Iran held that it is “necessary to exclude the effects of

actions taken by the nationalizing State in relation to the enterprise which
actions may have depressed its value.”

59. This view is shared by ICSID tribunals. As stated in Azurix: “in assessing
fair market value, a tribunal would establish that value in a hypothetical
context where the State would not have resorted to such manoeuvres but
would have fully respected the provisions of the treaty and the contract
concerned.”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-21 The Claimants contend that the relevant date from which to calculate compensation is

“the date immediately preceding the actions or omissions that rendered the expropriation

Part XII — Page 13

irreversible”, identifying other decisions of ICSID tribunals® which have endorsed this

approach (Quan. Mem. at 21-22):

“63. This approach had [sic] been widely endorsed by arbitral practice. In the
words of the Azurix tribunal:

“fijn a case of direct expropriation, the moment when
expropriation has occurred can usually be established without
difficulty. In the case where indirect or “creeping” expropriation
has taken place or, as the Santa Elena tribunal put it, “the date on
which the governmental ‘interference’ has deprived the owner of
his rights or has made those rights practically useless”, it will be
much more difficult for the tribunal to establish the exact time of
the expropriation. The difficulty is no less severe, unless the
decision is based on a single act creating liability, when the
Tribunal concludes that an investor has not received fair and
equitable treatment or that it has been subjected to arbitrary
treatment or that the host State has not provided the investor the
full protection and security guarantee by the BIT. The Iran-U.S.
Claims Tribunal, in one of its awards, decided that “where the
alleged expropriation is carried out by way of a series of
interferences in the enjoyment of property”, the date of the
expropriation is “the day when the interference has ripened into a
more or less irreversible deprivation of the property rather than on
the beginning date of the events”. It has been sometimes argued
that applying this formula would lead to an inequitable situation
where the investment’s value would be assessed at the time when
the cumulative actions of the State would have led to a dramatic
devaluation of the investment. However, such a view does not take
into account that, in assessing fair market value, a tribunal would
establish that value in a hypothetical context where the State would
not have resorted to such manoeuvres but would have fully
respected the provisions of the treaty and the contract concerned.”

12-22 In the Claimants’ submission, the latest appropriate date of valuation is 20 August 2000,
the day preceding the Secretariat’s decision of 21 August 2000 to postpone the

registration of used vehicles (Quan. Mem. at 23-25):

“66. Mexico’s actions and omissions had an adverse affect on the Concession
as early as July 2000. The Claimants and the Respondent agree that there

© The Claimants also cite the following arbitral awards in support of this point: Compafia del Desarrollo de Santa
Elena, S.A. v. The Republic of Costa Rica (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Final Award of 17 February 2000, 15 ICSID
Review-FILJ (2000), 169 at para. 76; and Metalclad Corp. v. The United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB.

was significant and growing political pressure against the private
management and operation of the motor vehicle registry, including from
the Mayor of Mexico City and from Governors of at least 17 States.
Furthermore, on 2 July 2000 Vicente Fox was elected President of Mexico
after his party had opposed the private operation of the motor vehicle
registry.

67. It is the Claimants’ submission that Mexico’s successive interferences
ripened into an irreversible expropriation on 21 August 2000. On this date
the Secretariat announced Mexico's unilateral decision to extend the
deadline for the registration of used vehicles, thereby irreversibly setting
in motion the sequence of events that led to the expropriation of the
Claimants’ investment. The Respondent does not contest the unilateral
nature of this decision in its Rejoinder. [...]

68. The effects of this decision are substantiated by the Respondent’s
evidence. The Freyssinier Report states that:

“Revenues were 60% lower than expected, mainly due to the
events described in the background section of this report, which
resulted in that only new cars and part of the expected number of
used cars could be registered during the period of operation.”

69. In sum, this sovereign and unilateral decision had serious, immediate and
irreversible effects on Renave. It was the first act in a chain of events,
followed within a week by the Technical Intervention (28 August 2000),
the two Administrative Interventions, the Seizure, and, finally, the
Revocation. On 21 August 2000 the Secretariat made public the decision
that rendered expropriation irreversible.”

12-23 At the Tribunal’s request, the Claimants also assessed the value of their investments in

the Concessionaire as at two other potential valuation dates, described in greater detail

below in Part XIII of this Award.

12-24 However, the Claimants’ general approach remains unchanged, whatever the valuation
date. In the Claimants’ submission, even taking a valuation date as late as December

2002, the project remained highly profitable (Claimants’ Post-Hearing Br. at 16-17):

“66. It can be taken from the evidence that later valuation dates would give
time to resolve the internal difficulties identified in the evidence of PRA
and relied on as further reasons why the LECG evaluation is
unacceptable. These were referred to on the cross-examination of Mr
Tormo as “red flags” (D4.887-875). The evidence of Mrs Barrera was to
the effect that it would have been possible to resolve any apparent

Part XII — Page 15

accounting irregularities (D4.798-800). Moreover, the evidence of Mr.
Rion, when asked if he would have advised the board of Renave on 20
August 2000 to sell the shares in the company, was that he would have
advised them to “fix” their problems and then sell (D7.1568, 3-17). The
inference to be drawn from this evidence is that, given time, the internal
problems could be fixed.

67. The undisputed evidence of LECG (LECG letter dated October 9, 2005,
paragraph 37) is that the total number of new vehicles registered as of
June 27 2001 was 795,000. Total new vehicle registrations as of
December I 2002 was 2,229,384 (Ibid paragraph 38). It is submitted that
the existence of this record on either of the two dates is plainly sufficient
for the purposes of the application of the DCF method. Thus the adoption
of either date makes it unnecessary to consider whether ex-post
information may be considered.

[ou]

70. On either date, a comparison of actual new vehicle registrations with
Business Plan projections and actual derived revenues with projected
revenues shows that the actual numbers exceeded the projected numbers
by a considerable margin.

71. Any concern that LECG might not have taken fully into account the risks
facing the investment in calculating lost profit damages (LECG September
12, 2007, paragraph 43) has no relevance if either of the two later dates
are taken. This is because the evidence shows that by the earliest of the
two dates the new vehicle operations had been fully operational for a
period of about two years and the “storm” of August/September 2000 had
blown over. Mr. Rién acknowledged this (D7:1582, 17-20).”

12-25 Finally, the Claimants submit that the standard of compensation applicable to their
expropriation claims under the two BITs applies equally to their claims relating to the
Respondent’s breach of the FET standards in the BITs, quoting the following passage
from Professor Lowenfeld’s 2003 monograph International Economic Law (Quan. Mem.

at 12):

“Tt is worth noting that the BITs set out the criteria for compensation only
in respect to expropriation or measures tantamount to expropriation. No
comparable criteria are set out in any of the treaties ' for breach of the
obligation to accord ional t) tr

full protection and security, or fair and equitable treatment. Arbitral
tribunals that have found a violation of one or more of these provisions
have in effect borrowed from the provisions and precedents concerned
with expropriations.”

 

Part XII — Page 16

12-26 In the Claimants’ submission, this case “echoes that of Vivendi”, in which the tribunal
determined that the level of damages flowing from different treaty breaches was

equivalent (Quan. Rep. at 38, para. 79):

“Of course, the level of damages necessary to compensate for a breach
of the fair and equitable standard could be difference [sic] from a case
where the same government expropriates the foreign investment. This
difference will generally turn on whether the investment has been
merely impaired or destroyed. Here, however, we are not faced with a
need to so differentiate, given our earlier finding that the same state
measures infringed both relevant Articles of the BIT and that these
measures emasculated the Concession Agreement, rendering it
valueless. Put differently, the breaches of Articles 3 and 5 caused more
or less equivalent harm.”

12-27 The Claimants point to other decisions in which arbitration tribunals have awarded
damages for breach of treaty obligations other than expropriation, under the Chorzéw

Factory standard (Quan. Mem. at 12-13):

“35. International arbitral tribunals have awarded damages for breaches of the
fair and equitable treatment standard by reference to the Chorzéw
Factory principle. For instance, the tribunal in Maffezini v. Spain
awarded the investor compensatory damages because acts attributable to
the Kingdom of Spain amounted to a breach by Spain of its obligation to
protect the investment as provided for in the Argentina-Spain BIT. An
instrumentality of the Spanish government had transferred to itself from
Maffezini’s account a so called “loan” for 30 million Spanish pesetas. The
tribunal found that this transaction was performed with so little
transparency that it violated the treaty’s fair and equitable treatment
provision. Relying on the Chorzéw Factory principle, it awarded full
compensatory damages to wipe out the effects of Spain’s breach of the
treaty’s fair and equitable treatment provision.

36. Likewise, the tribunal in CMS v. Argentina explicitly relied on the
Chorz6w Factory principle to determine the standard of compensation
applicable to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. The
tribunal summarized its findings as follows:

“[t]he loss suffered by the claimant is the general standard
commonly used in international law in respect of injury to
property, including often capital value, loss of profits and
expenses. The methods to provide compensation, a number of
which the parties have discussed, are not unknown in international
law. Depending on the circumstances, various methods have been

Part XII — Page 17

used by tribunals to determine the compensation which should be
paid out but the general concept upon which commercial valuation
of assets is based is that of ‘fair market value’.

The Tribunal specifically ruled that it was

“persuaded that the cumulative nature of the breaches discussed
here is best dealt with by resorting to the standard of fair market
value. While this standard figures prominently in respect of
expropriation, it is not excluded that it might also be appropriate
for breaches different from expropriation if their effect results in
important long-term losses.”

In MTD v. Chile, the ICSID tribunal also had to determine the standard of
compensation applicable to breaches of the fair and equitable treatment
[sic]. The tribunal accepted Claimants’ proposal to apply the standard of
compensation formulated in Chorzéw by the PCIJ. That award has
recently been considered by a distinguished ad hoc A li i
which did not annul any part of the Award.

The Azurix tribunal faced an identical question. The relevant sections of
the tribunal's reasoning merit reproducing in full:

“Loud

424. In the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that a
compensation based on the fair market value of the
Concession would be appropriate, particularly since the
Province has taken it over. Fair market value has been
defined as: “the price expressed in terms of cash
equivalents, at which property would change hands
between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a
hypothetical and able seller, acting at arm’s length in an
open and unrestricted market, when neither is under
compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable
knowledge of the relevant facts.”

(03) THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

12-28 The Respondent observes that there is no material difference between the applicable BITs
as regards the standard of compensation for expropriation. Furthermore, it is not disputed
by the Respondent that this standard reflects the Chorzéw Factory standard (Quan. Rej. at

para. 35).

12-29 However, the Respondent contests the Claimants’ assertion that the standard of
compensation in Chorzéw Factory entitles the Claimants to recovery the compensation
prescribed in the relevant BITs plus loss of profits, relying upon NAFTA decisions’
(Quan. Rej. at para. 43-46):

“43. [...] The Respondent disagrees with this purported application of the full
reparation principle, as extended in obiter in Vivendi, at least in any case
where the BIT at issue prescribes fair market value or its equivalent as the
standard of compensation.

44, First, as a matter of treaty interpretation, it has been recognized by
NAFTA tribunals applying a standard of compensation similar to the BITs
at issue here, that damages payable for a violation of NAFTA Article 1110
should be equivalent to the stipulated standard of compensation (i.e., fair
market value immediately before the expropriation took place, assessed in
the manner prescribed). This follows as a logical consequence of
breaching Article 1110: the direct or indirect expropriation of an
investment of an investor of another Party without prompt payment of
compensation based on the fair market value of the investment gives rise
to a claim for payment of damages equal to what should have been paid,
plus interest.

45. Second, whenever the prescribed standard of compensation is fair market
value or its equivalent, the Chorzéw Factory requirement of full
reparation will be met. The BITs at issue here, like NAFTA Article 1110,
provide for market value immediately prior to the date of expropriation
and eliminate the prospect of a reduction in value by reason of the
expropriation’s becoming known earlier. The fair market value of the
investment — based on the traditional test of what a willing buyer would
pay a willing seller when both parties are properly informed of the
relevant facts — would amount to full compensation if paid promptly at the

7 In particular, the Respondent cites the arbitral awards in Metalclad at para. 118 and Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v.
United Mexican States (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1), Award of 16 December 2002, para. 194.

Part XII — Page 19

time of expropriation. There is no retrospective reduction in value or
increase in value for after-occurring events, such as unforeseen changes —
positive or negative — in relevant markets or economic conditions. Simply
put, a claimant gets what its investment was worth at the time it was
expropriated and an award of interest compensates it for any delay in the
receipt of such payment.

46. When and to what extent future profits may be to [sic: be] taken into
account is a separate question. The BITs at issue here do not stipulate
DCF or any other form of future profits analysis as a valuation criterion
to be taken into account in assessing fair market value. The Respondent
has acknowledged that DCF may be an appropriate criterion to be taken
into account in a proper case, but the jurisprudence consistently points to
the requirement for a suitable performance record, including one of
profitability, before that can be done. As discussed more fully below, the
record of new car registration which the Claimants urge the Tribunal to
consider as a track record of profitability did not exist on the date for
expropriation and provides no guidance as to the profitability of the
Registry’s operation as originally envisaged (i.e. as a new and used
vehicle registry). Indeed, the new vehicle registration only came into
being because the Secretariat “fronted” the Registry after the Cavallo
scandal resulted in the collapse of public confidence in the Registry.”

 

[Footnotes omitted]

12-30 As regards the appropriate valuation method, the Respondent submits that neither BIT

12-31

requires that a particular valuation method be applied to calculate the market value of an
investment. The Respondent submits that, in the circumstances of this case, the ‘asset
value’ and ‘declared tax’ value methods “should be preferred over the DCF method”,
which the Respondent describes as “wholly speculative and impermissible, due to
Renave’s absence of a proven track record of profitable operations at the date of

valuation” (Quan. CM at 5, para. 23).

The Respondent thus “disagrees with the Claimants’ contention that ‘the DCF approach

is the one that is to be adopted, unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so”

 

[emphasis in original]. The Respondent further explains its case as follows (Quan. Rej. at

paras. 40-41):

“40. [...] The authorities do not posit such an “operative assumption” in
favour of DCF; rather, as stated by the International Law Commission,
the general rule is the opposite. As Mexico noted in the quotation from the

Part XII — Page 20

commentary on the ILC’s Articles on State Responsibility (cited at
paragraph 34 of the Counter-Memorial):

... difficulties can arise in the application of the DCF method to
establish capital value in the compensation context. The method
analyses a wide range of inherently speculative elements, some of
which have a significant impact on the outcome (e.g. discount
rates, currency fluctuations, inflation figures, commodity prices,
interest rates and other commercial risks). This has led tribunals
to adopt a cautious approach to the use of the method. Hence
although income-based methods have been accepted in principle.
there has been a decided preference for asset-based methods.

41. The Reply on Quantum cites a recent text by McLachlan, Shore and
Weiniger, International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles,
which discusses the usefulness of the DCF methodology. However,
immediately after discussing the methodology’s attributes, the authors
acknowledge that a number of tribunals have refused to apply it:

Recently, a number of tribunals have refused to award DCF-based
compensation to enterprises lacking a proven track record of
profitability ... These awards do not represent any dissatisfaction
with DCF methodology as a whole and are consistent with the
World Bank Guidelines, which limit DCF awards to going
concerns with a proven track record of profitability.

42. This is indeed the case. The Guidelines do require that for DCF to be
employed, the investment must be a “going concern with a proven track
record of profitability.” The Guidelines go on to state that “for an
enterprise which, not being a proven going concern, demonstrates lack of
profitability,” compensation shall be “on the basis of the liquidation
value.”

[The Respondent's emphasis]

12-32 The Respondent highlights the difficulties associated with exclusive reliance on the DCF
method, as articulated by the majority of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal in Amoco

International Finance (Quan. CM at 6-7):

“25. This Tribunal will be well aware of the problems associated with relying
exclusively on the DCF method. The Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal observed
in Amoco International Finance Corp. (a case on which the Claimants
place reliance) that:

238. As a projection into the future, any cash flow projection has an
element of speculation associated with it, as recognized by the

Part XII — Page 21

26.

27.

Claimant. For this reason it is disputable whether a tribunal can
use it at all for the valuation of compensation. One of the best
settled rules of the law of international responsibility of States is
that no reparation for speculative or uncertain damages can be
awarded. This holds true for the existence of the damage and its
effect as well.

It is worth noting that Judge Brower’s opinion in Amoco, cited by the
Claimants expressly indicates that he concurred only to form the majority
necessary to an award [sic] by the tribunal. His opinion on valuation, on
which the Claimants’ Memorial relies, was the dissenting opinion, a fact
not noted by the Claimants.

In Amoco, the tribunal held:

228.

229.

231.

As used by the Claimant in the present Case, however, the DCF

method goes even further: it_amounts to_a complete departure
‘rom, and _a_ reversal of, the approach traditionally adopted in

 

 

international practice, notably, by international tribunals. Under
the traditional approach, in case of expropriation of an enterprise
the ion to be paid is calculated according to the net

 

value of the transferred — that is, expropriated — assets. As we
have seen this can extend to physical properties, movable and
immovable, as well as to intangibles, including profitability in the
case of an ongoing enterprise: the “going concern” value. To this
element of damnum emergens, a complementary one is added
where the expropriation is unlawful: the value of the revenues that
the owner earned if the expropriation had not occurred, i.e. lucrum
cessans.

The Claimant's calculation completely leaves aside the net value
of the expropriated assets: this value has no place whatsoever in
the Claimant's _r i Exit d emergens. The
Claimant's method is instead a projection into the future to assess
the amount of the revenues which would be earned by the
undertaking, year after year, up to eighteen years later in this
Case. These forecasted revenues are actualized at the time by way
of a discounting calculation, and capitalized as the measure of the
compensation to be paid, as well as the alleged market value of the
enterprise. With such a method, lucrum cessans becomes the sole
element of compensation...

In the case of a going concern, as the AMINOIL tribunal aptly put
it, the value of the enterprise as a whole is higher than the sum of
the discrete elements which constitute it ... but it remains related
to these elements. With the DCF method, as used in this case, the
alleged value of the undertaking has no relation whatsoever to the

Part XII — Page 22

value of these elements — and therefore to the investment made in
order to create the concern and to maintain its profitability. The
replacement value, that is, the investment necessary to create a
similar undertaking, is no more taken into consideration. The
capitalization of the future earnings will probably amount to a
much higher figure, which could lead to unjust enrichment for the
beneficiary of such compensation, since he could, hypothetically,
establish a similar enterprise with comparable earnings, spending
only a portion of the compensation received, and earn additional
revenues with the remaining part. If the enterprise were less
profitable, the claimant would probably refer to another method,
as the claimant did in the Chorzéw Factory case. It is one thing to

 

 

 

recognize, as this Tribunal and many other international tribunals
before it have done, that the profitability of a going concern is one
of the elk to be considered in the luati of such_a
concern; it is another thing to i a_capitalization_of

 

Teg OF

h hetical future earnings for all other elements of.
[The Respondent's emphasis; footnotes omitted]

12-33 The Respondent observes that although the Amoco tribunal was not ultimately called
upon to determine the damages in that case (due to settlement of the claim between the
parties), the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal has expressed similar reservations over the use of

DCF valuations in other decisions® (Quan. CM at 7-8):

“28. Amoco was subsequently settled, so one cannot gauge what the tribunal
would have determined was the investment’s value and then compare it to
that claimant’s proposed DCF value. What can be seen, however, is that
the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal was rightly wary of DCF valuations. For
example:

. In American International Group, the tribunal rejected the
claimant's DCF valuations ranging from US$74 million to US$147
million and awarded it US$10 million in damages.

. In Phelps Dodge, the tribunal refused to employ a DCF valuation
for a shareholding interest in a manufacturing company on the
ground it had not become a going concern “so that such elements
of value as future profits and goodwill could be confidently
valued” and “any conclusions on these matters would be highly

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent refers to the following Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal awards: Phillips Petroleum Co.
v. Iran, 21 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 79 at para. 79, Partial Award No. 425-39-2, 29 June 1989; American International Corp.
v. Iran, 4 Iran-U.S. C.T.R. 96 at 106, Award No. 93-2-3, 19 December 1983; INA Corp. v. Iran, 8 Iran-U.S. C.T.R.
373 at 380, Award No. 184-161-1, 13 August 1985; James M. Saghi et al v. Iran, 29 Iran-U.S.C.T.R. 20 at para. 79,
Award No, 544-298-2, 22 January 1993.

Part XII — Page 23

speculative.” It therefore concluded that Phelps Dodge’s capital
invested in the company was “equal to its investment.”

. In Starrett Housing, the tribunal approved its own expert's use of a
DCF analysis to value the claimant’s ownership rights in a joint
venture for the construction of a housing project, but reduced the
award from the expert’s figure of 377 million rials to only 27
million rials, approximately 7% of the value reached by the
expert.”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-34 According to the Respondent, this arbitral caution against exclusive reliance on the DCF

method is to be found in other arbitral decisions (Quan. CM at 8-10):

“30. For example, the Metatclad tribunal agreed with previous awards that a
period of two to three years of profitable operations is required before a
discounted cash flow valuation could be considered reliable:

119. Normally, the fair market value of a going concern which
has a history of profitable operation may be based on an
estimate of future profits subject to a discounted cash flow
analysis. Benvenuti and Bonfant Srl v. The Government of
the People’s Republic of Congo, 1 ICSID Reports 330; 21
LL.M. 758; AGIP vy. The Government of the People’s
Republic of Congo, I ICSID Report 306.

120. However, where the enterprise _has_not operated for_a
sufficiently long time to establish a performance record, or
where it has failed to make a profit, future profits cannot be
used to determine the going concern or fair market value.
In Sola Tiles, Inc. v. Iran (1987) Iran-U.S.C.T.R. 224, 240-
42; ILL.R. 460, 480-81, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal
pointed to the importance in relation to a company’s value
of “its business reputation and the relationship it has
established with its suppliers and customers”. Similarly, in
Asian Agricultural Products v. Sri Lanka (4 ICSID Reports
246 (1990) at 292) another Tribunal observed, in dealing
with the comparable problem of the assessment of the value
of goodwill, that its ascertainment “requires the prior
presence on the market for at least two or three years,
which is the minimum period needed to establish
continuing business connections”.

 

 

Part XII — Page 24

31.

Likewise, in Southern Pacific Properties, the ICC tribunal rejected the
claimants’ DCF valuation on the same basis and on other factors also
relevant to the instant case:

65. We feel unable to accept the claimants’ estimate of the value of the
investment as at May 1978 for a variety of reasons, some of which
may be summarized as follows:

(1)

(2)

(3)

(4)

(5)

(6)

We believe the risk factor is much higher than has been
assumed in the projections. We consider that if the
projected figures of income and expenditure were to be
adopted they would carry a much higher discount rate.
The uncertainties were very considerable. The project was
a unique one in a very sensitive area from an
environmental and political point of view. This involved
risks against which even the Egyptian Government could
not give full guarantees. They were bound to lead and did
lead to differences between the parties to the Joint Venture.

By the date of the cancellation, the political and economic
climate has a number of new elements unfavourable to the
venture’s prospects. This is one of the reasons why we feel
only very limited weight should be given to the transactions
in the shares of SPP(ME) which took place between
eighteen months and two years previously.

There was a considerable risk in a change in the tax status
of the venture after the initial five year period.

By the date of the cancellation the great majority of the
work had still to be done.

The calculation put forward by the claimants produces a
disparity between the amount of the investment made by the
claimants and its supposed value at the material date.

There is still the possibility, although we suspect it is a
remote one, that there will be some recovery from the
proceedings now involving the ETDC.

For these and other reasons we are of the opinion that an
approach to the quantification of dé by means of a
discounted cash flow calculation should in_this particular
case be rejected. We consider it more appropriate to take
the amount of the claimants’ actual in and add to
that an incremental factor repr ing the increase in the

value of the investment over its actual cost...

 

 

Part XII — Page 25

32. The ICSID tribunal likewise held in Southern Pacific Properties [i.e. the
ICSID arbitration, following the ICC arbitration] that a DCF valuation
was inappropriate:

188. In the Tribunal’s view, the DCF method is not appropriate for
determining the fair compensation in this case because the project
was not in existence for a sufficient period of time to generate the
data necessary for a meaningful DCF calculation... The project
was in its infancy and there is very little history on which to base
projected revenues.

189. In these circumstances, the application of the DCF method would,
in the Tribunal’s view, result in awarding “! ible but contingent
and_undeterminable damage, which, in accordance _with_the
jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals, cannot be taken into account”.
(Chorz6w Factory case, Series A, No. 17, 1928, at p. 51). As the
tribunal in the Amoco case observed:

One of the best settled rules on international responsibility of
States is that no reparation for speculative or uncertain damages
can be awarded.

33. More recently, in Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt, the
tribunal rejected the DCF valuation approach in favour of awarding the
claimant the return of the capital it had actually invested in its hotel
project:

124. Like the Metalclad and SPP disputes, here, there is [an]
insufficiently “solid base on which to found any profit ... or
for predicting growth or expansion of the investment
made” by Wena. Wena had operated the Luxor hotel for
less than eighteen months, and had not completed its
renovations on the Nile hotel, before they were seized on
April 1, 1991. In addition, there is some question whether
Wena had sufficient finances to fund its renovation and
operation of the hotels. Finally, the Tribunal is disinclined
to. grant Wena’s request for lost profits and lost
opportunities given the large disparity between the
requested amounts (GB£ 45.7 million) and the Wena’s
stated investment in the two hotels (US$8,819,466.93).””

[Respondent’s emphasis; footnotes omitted]

12-35 The Respondent also relies upon the ILC Commentary to Article 36 of the ILC’s Draft
Articles on State Responsibility, highlighting language critical of the DCF method (Quan.
CM at 10):

Part XII — Page 26

“34.

12-36 In addition to this arbitral jurisprudence and doctrine, the Respondent contends that the
DCF method has consistently been rejected in NAFTA arbitrations to which Mexico has
been a party, citing the awards in Metalclad, Feldman and Tecmed. Taking Tecmed to

illustrate its general proposition, the Respondent contends as follows (Quan. CM at 11-

12):

“36.

The International Law Cc ission cited the jud; s of the Iran-U.S.
Claims Tribunal in support of its commentary on Article 36 of the Articles
of State Responsibility, where the DCF method is criticized and where it
points out that it is the “decided preference” (emphasis added) in the
cases to use asset-based methods for valuing expropriated investments:

 

(26) Since 1945, valuation techniques have been developed to factor in
different elements of risk and probability. The discounted cash
flow (DCF) method has gained some favour, especially in the
context of calculations involving income over a limited duration,
as in the case of wasting assets. Although developed as a tool for
assessing commercial value, it can also be useful in the context of
calculating value for compensation purposes. But difficulties can
arise in the application of the DCF method to establish capital
value in the ¢ ion context. The method analyses a wide
range of inherently speculative elements, some_of which_have
significant impact on the outcome (e.g. discounts rates, currency
fluctuations, inflation figures, commodity prices, interest rates and
other commercial risks.) This has led tribunals to adopt a cautious
approach to the use of the method. Hence although income-based
methods have been accepted in principle, there has been a decided
preference for asset-based methods. A particular concern is the
risk of double counting which arises from the relationship between
the capital value of an enterprise and its contractually based
profits.”

[Respondent’s emphasis; footnotes omitted]

Apropos [sic] to the instant case is the fact that the Tecmed tribunal
agreed with Mexico on two salient points: first, it agreed that the
claimant’s DCF valuation of US$52 million was completely out of
proportion with its actual investment in the investment (US$4 million) and
second, applying Metalclad and other authorities, it agreed that the
claimant's track record with the investment was insufficiently long enough
to employ a DCF valuation:

186. The Arbitral Tribunal has noted both the remarkable disparity
between the estimates of the two expert witnesses ... and also the
considerable differences in the amount paid under the tender offer

Part XII — Page 27

for assets related to the Landfill — US$4,028,788 — and the relief
sought by the Claimant, amounting to US$52,000,000, likely to be

ct with the legiti and genuine esti on return on
Claimant’ 's investment at the time of making the investment. The
non-relevance of the brief history of operation of the Landfill by
Cytrar — a little more than two years — and the difficulties in
obtaining objective data allowing for application of the discounted
cash flow method on the basis of estimates for a protracted future,
not less than 15 years, together with the fact that such future cash
flow also depends upon investments to be made — building of seven
additional cells — in the long term, lead the Arbitral Tribunal to
disregard such methodology to determine the relief to be awarded
to the Claimant.

37. As shall be developed in greater detail, the factors cited in Tecmed for
refusing to use a DCF valuation are even more pronounced in the instant
case: (i) the amount invested is proportionately smaller compared to the
DCF valuation proposed by the Claimants’ experts; (ii) Renave had an
even briefer period of operations (only five weeks operating at the
national level as compared to 2 years in Tecmed); and (iii) obtaining
objective data for applying the DCF method is even more problematic in
the instant case than it was in Tecmed.”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-37 The Respondent concludes that the DCF method should be rejected by this Tribunal
because there is no proven track record of the Concessionaire’s profitable operations at

the date of valuation in this case, whatever it may be (Quan. CM at 12-13):

“38. As in Metalclad, Tecmed, Southern Pacific Properties, Wena and other
cases, the evidence in the instant case demonstrates the absence of a
proven track record of profitable operations on the date of valuation:

. At the Claimant's date of valuation, 20 August 2000, Renave was
not profitable. According to its income statement for July 2000,
the Concessionaire had a net loss of more than $4.1 million pesos
and had accumulated losses for $15.2 million pesos during the
year. By the end of August, the Concessionaire had an
accumulated net loss of $37.2 million pesos (or $44 million,
depending on which financial statements are used.).

. At the date of valuation Renave had been operating at the national
level for only 5 weeks and for new vehicles for only 3 months. The
Concessionaire had existed for less than a year and most of that
time was taken up with start-up activities. This period of

Part XII — Page 28

operations is far less than what the authorities require to be able
to apply a DCF valuation.

. Renave itself had little understanding of its financial situation at
the time, other than recognizing that it could not operate on the
basis of existing cash flows and that it required additional
capitalization. At the date of valuation, it was unable to identify
which revenues were being received from new vehicle registrations
and which were from used vehicle registrations (a rather serious
problem for a motor vehicle registry). This points up [sic: to] an
obvious problem with projecting unknown or uncertain results
forward.

 

. There was considerable uncertainty surrounding key aspects of the
project, for example, regarding the voluntary participation of the
states which was required to implement the Registry fully,
regarding the viability of the planned fee structure which would
affect the Concessionaire’s profitability, concerning the operation
of the database which was at the core of the endeavour, and so on.

. The project was not evolving as originally intended: there were
significant departures from the Business Plan concerning the
project’s financing and the way it operated (in terms of
outsourcing key functions to third parties).”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-38 The Respondent concludes that all the relevant facts, as of 20 August 2000 (being the
Claimants’ primary date for valuation), disprove any track record of profitable operations

by the Concessionaire (Quan. Rej. at paras. 52-53):

“52. [...] (i) Renave was in its infancy with only 5 weeks of operations at the
national level; (ii) its performance record was one of un-profitability; (iii)
its prospects were looking poor, so much so that its Board decided to
postpone the contractually required publicity campaign and contemplated
seeking the Secretariat’s consent to avoid its contractual obligation to
conduct a market study; (iv) it had manifold internal operating problems,
as evidenced in its own documents; and (v) as agreed by the disputing
parties, the Secretariat was encouraging considerable difficulties in
negotiating voluntary coordination agreements with the federative entities.

53. Moreover, four days after the Claimants’ selected date of valuation, this
already troubled project was plunged into a crisis that:

. Provoked the widespread, non-partisan and legitimate concern of
legislators;

Part XII — Page 29

. Caused 80% of Mexican citizens polled, according to the Reforma
opinion poll of 30 August 2000, to be opposed to the Registry and
its operation by a private concessionaire;

. Led the Secretariat to intervene in the Concessionaire (which
intervention was later upheld by the courts and was entirely
reasonable at international law);

. Which intervention reduced the Registry’s coverage, initially
temporarily (and in the end for the remainder of the Registry’s
existence), from being a comprehensive new and used motor
vehicle registry to being a new vehicle registry alone; and

. Justified the exercise of a number of the Secretariat's rights under
the Title of Concession and applicable legal framework.”

12-39 As for each of the alternative potential valuation dates identified by the Tribunal, June

2001 and December 2002, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ DCF approach to

valuation, and in particular the separate registration of new and used vehicles, remains

wholly inappropriate to measure any compensation on the facts of this case

(Respondent’s Post-Hearing Br. at 21-22):

“45,

.. first, the allegations against Cavallo and ensuing events would have been fatal
to the concessionaire had the government not stepped in and, second, it was never
agreed - expressly or by implication - that by reason of the scandal the
concessionaire would be entitled to carry on business indefinitely as a new car
registry operated essentially under government auspices and control.

The Claimants have no basis to contend, as they do in their Reply on Quantum,
that they could or should be awarded DCF value of the concession operating
solely as anew car registry. The Secretariat would have been entirely justified, at
any point in time, to demand that the concessionaire comply in all material
respects with the Title of Concession — including the provision of a full used
vehicle registry. Conspicuously absent from the Claimants’ case was any
evidence that concessionaire was ready, willing or able to resume its obligations
under the Title of Concession entirely autonomously of the Secretariat. There was
no confession and idance no of public relations
experts, no public relations campaign, and, above all, no plan of any kind to re-
establish public confidence in Renave. Instead, the Renave shareholders were
content to have the Secretariat operate a new car registry and to be paid
dividends on earnings that would not have been earned had they had been left to
fend for themselves after 24 August 2000.

 

It is obvious that the Concessionaire could not have succeeded in persuading used
car owners to register their vehicles without a fundamental change to the

Part XII — Page 30

48.

49.

50.

constitution and management of Renave calculated to restore public confidence.
Moreover, it cannot be presumed, as the Claimants contend, that the registration
of new cars would automatically occur despite the lost confidence in Renave

It can be fairly assumed that the Mexican Automobile Dealers Association
(AMDA) would have resisted efforts to force its members to comply with the
registration requirement if customers were concerned that personal data would
be mishandled or misused. Even on a purely practical level there would have been
problems, as indicated in the testimony of Ms. Barrera who said that even when
the Secretariat operated the registry, verification of the new car registration
requirement and remittances required counting inventory at each dealership, an
undertaking complicated by the fact that dealers frequently trade or transfer
vehicles in order to meet customer needs.

The requirement to operate a used vehicle registry was never waived or removed
from the Title of Concession. Thus, the Claimants bore the burden of convincing
the Tribunal that Renave was ready, willing and able to perform its obligations in
full, rather than being content to sit back and collect dividends while an
incomplete registry was operated under the government's auspices. In Mexico's
submission, they did not do so and there can be no claim for deprivation of any
purported right to continue operating a registry only for new vehicles.

Any award based on a projection of future profits following the suspension of the
obligation to register new vehicles would be entirely speculative. If the
Secretariat had demanded compliance with the operation of the registry as
originally conceived and contractually agreed, would the concessionaire have
been capable of fulfilling its obligations? Or if the Tribunal were to find that in
June 2001 or December 2002 the Secretariat was obliged to withdraw and give
the concessionaire an opportunity to autonomously operate a_ substantially
scaled-back registry for new cars for the balance of the term of the concession,
can it be confidentially said that Renave actually would have succeeded in
achieving the profits projected by Mr. Tormo?”

[Footnotes omitted]

12-40 The Respondent submits that, consistent with Chorzéw Factory, the results of one

valuation method must be tested against the results of other methods “in order to avoid

speculative or undue awards of damages” (Quan. CM at 14):

“41.

As long ago as the Chorzé6w Factory Case, the Permanent Court of
International Justice underscored the desirability of comparing one
method of valuation against the others. In discussing the various
questions which it posed to the court-appointed valuation expert, the
Court noted:

Part XII — Page 31

...the Court considers it preferable to endeavour to ascertain the
value to be i d by several methods, in order to permit of a
comparison and if necessary of « leting the results of the one by
those of the others. The Court, therefore, reserves every right to
review the valuations referred to in the different formulae; basing
itself on the results of the said valuations and of facts and
documents submitted to it, it will then proceed to determine the
sum to be awarded to the German government, in conformity with
the legal principles set out above.”

[The Respondent's emphasis]

12-41 Finally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion that all treaty breaches under the
BITs are equivalent to expropriation for the purpose of determining the measure of
compensation for those breaches, quoting from the NAFTA tribunal’s award in S.D.

Myers (Quan. CM at 29, para. 111):

“306. SDMI [the claimant] suggested in its Memorial that Chapter 11 tribunals
are likely to find that the standard set out in Article 1110(2) [the NAFTA’s
expropriation provision] applies also to breaches of the other Articles of
chapter 11. The Tribunal doubts that Article 1110(2) supplies the
appropriate standard when a Party has breached one of the other
provisions of Chapter 11...

309 ~~ By not identifying any particular methodology for the assessment of
compensation in cases not involving expropriation, the Tribunal considers
that the drafters of the NAFTA intended to leave it open to tribunals to
determine a measure of compensation appropriate to the specific
circumstances of the case, taking into account the principles of both
international law and the provisions of the NAFTA. In some non-
expropriation cases a tribunal might think it appropriate to adopt the
“fair market value” standard; in other cases it might not. In this case the
Tribunal considers that the application of the fair market value standard
is not a logical, appropriate or practicable measure of the compensation

to be awarded.”

(04) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISION

12-42

12-43

12-44

General Approach: The Tribunal, for reasons which are self-evident from this Award,
has found the issues of compensation both complicated and difficult to resolve on the
particular facts of this case, including the starkly different evidence from their quantum
expert witnesses, Mr Charles Tormo of LECG/Horwath for the Claimants and Mr Pablo
Rion of Pablo Rion & Associates (PRA) for the Respondent. It is appropriate to decide
first the Tribunal’s general approach on the quantum issues in this part of the Award, to

be followed by detailed consideration in the following parts of the Award.

Relevant Date: Both under international law and (directly or by analogy) Article 5 of the
two BITs, the relevant date for assessing compensation is 24 June 2001, being the day
preceding the unlawful Requisition of 25 June 2001. As to the relevant legal principles,
the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ submission, summarised above, to such effect: see
the cited passages from the awards in Santa Elena, Metalclad and Azurix. As to the
application of such principles to the facts of this case, the Tribunal has decided earlier in
this Award, in Parts VIII and IX above, that the Requisition of 25 June 2001 was the first
completed breach by the Respondent under both BITs, as regards both the FET standards

and unlawful expropriation.

It is immaterial that the Requisition was also the first of continuing unlawful acts by the
Respondent leading to the Revocation on 13 December 2002: Article 15 of the ILC’s
Articles on State Responsibility, entitled “Breach consisting of a composite act”, provides
as follows: “(1) The breach of an international obligation by a State through a series of
actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful occurs when the action or omission
occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the
wrongful act. (2) In such a case, the breach extends over the entire period starting with
the first of the actions or omissions of the series and lasts for as long as these actions or
omissions are repeated and remain not in conformity with the international obligation.”
The ILC Commentary to Article 15 states that the breach of an international obligation is

dated from the first act in a series of acts which together form the wrongful act. In

Part XII — Page 33

particular, the ILC Commentary provides that Article 15(2): “[...] deals with the
extension in time of a composite act. Once a sufficient number of actions or omissions
has occurred, producing the result of the composite act as such, the breach is dated to the
first of the acts in the series. The status of the first action or omission is equivocal until
enough of the series has occurred to constitute the wrongful act; but at that point the act
should be regarded as having occurred over the whole period from the commission of the
first action or omission. If this were not so, the effectiveness of the prohibited would

thereby be undermined.””

12-45 Accordingly, the Tribunal determines the relevant date for the assessment of
compensation as 24 June 2001; and it rejects the Claimants’ case as to any earlier date for

the assessment of compensation and the Respondent’s case as to any later date.

12-46 Shares Valuel

 

The Claimants’ shares in the Concessionaire are currently worthless
and have been so, effectively, from 31 December 2002. (The Concessionaire still had a
cash balance on 31 December 2002; but this value has since disappeared, as was

inevitable).

12-47 Lost Capital: As already noted, the Claimants received back from the Concessionaire in
April and December 2002, authorised by the Respondent, certain amounts intended to
compensate them for their lost capital in the Concessionaire, together with dividends and
other expenses. The Tribunal considers separately below, in Part XIV of this Award, the
question whether these amounts were sufficient to compensate the Claimants for lost

capital and their legal effect generally on the Claimants’ claims.

12-48 Lost Profits: It is clear from the Claimants’ submissions, summarised above, that their
claims for compensation derive otherwise, entirely, from the allegedly lost income stream
to be received by the Concessionaire from the Concession Agreement during the
remaining period of the Concession after the relevant date and, as a result of that alleged
loss, the Concessionaire’s lost profits ultimately impacting the Claimants’ investments in
the Concessionaire as shareholders. It is the Claimants’ claim derived indirectly from

these allegedly lost future profits by the Concessionaire which raises several distinct

Part XII — Page 34

issues. These are considered by the Tribunal separately in more detail below, in Part XIII

of this Award.

Duration: The period of the Concession Agreement was ten years, commencing on 15
September 1999 and expiring on 14 September 2009: see Paragraph 4-48 of Part IV
above. There was a possible extension thereafter of not more than ten more years, subject
(inter alia) to the discretion of the Secretariat. Whilst the exercise of that discretion was
not unfettered under Mexican law, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants’ claim for
this second period of ten years is far too contingent, uncertain and unproven, lacking any
sufficient factual basis for the assessment of compensation under the two BITs. At the
relevant date, the Concessionaire had no legal right to any extension of the Concession’s
original ten-year term; and as the Concessionaire’s minority shareholders, the Claimants’
rights as investors under the BITs were still more nebulous and speculative. Accordingly,
the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the Concession Agreement would not have
continued beyond 14 September 2009, i.e. 8.25 years after the Requisition of 25 June

2001; and the Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ claims based upon any period thereafter.

Investments: The Claimants’ claims for compensation derive only from their status as
investors with investments in the form of their respective minority shareholdings in the
Concessionaire, as distinct from any claim by the Concessionaire itself. Perhaps
inevitably, the Parties’ submissions occasionally elided this important distinction,
effectively treating the valuation of the Concessionaire’s future profits (if any) as the
relevant exercise for the assessment of compensation due to the Claimants. The exercise
required of this Tribunal is, in contrast, the valuation of the Claimants’ lost investments
in the form of their shares in the Concessionaire and not, as such, the lost profits incurred
by the Concessionaire under the Concession Agreement. The latter are not, of course,
irrelevant; but they are not directly relevant as if the Claimants’ claims were made by the

Concessionaire itself.

Chorz6w Factory: As to the general approach to the assessment of compensation, the
Tribunal accepts the general guidance provided by the well-known passage in the PCIJ’s

decision in Chorzéw Factory 1928 PCI, Series A, No 17 (Merits), 47, as invoked by

Part XII — Page 35

both the Claimants and the Respondent in these arbitration proceedings (summarised

above):

“The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act — a principle
which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions
of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this
is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind
would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be
covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it — such are the principles which
should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to
international law.”

The Tribunal is likewise guided by Article 31 of the ILC’s draft Articles of State

Responsibility, being declaratory of international law.

12-52 FET & Expropriation: The Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ submissions, as summarised
above, that this is an appropriate case in which the Tribunal should be guided by the same
measure for breach of the FET standards in the two BITs, as for unlawful expropriation
under the BITs: see the Enron award and Chorzéw Factory. Accordingly, the Tribunal
does not hereafter distinguish between compensation for unlawful expropriation and

compensation for breach of the FET standards.

12-53 Article 5 of the BITs: The Tribunal returns to its earlier acknowledgement (at the
beginning of this Part XII of the Award) that the provisions on compensation in Article 5
of the two BITS expressly address lawful expropriation, but that these provisions do not
address expressly either unlawful expropriation in breach of Article 5(1) of the BITs or
breach of the FET standards in Articles 3 and 4 of the BITs. Nonetheless, under
international law, the measures of compensation in the two BITs (which are materially
similar for present purposes) provide a useful guide to the measure of compensation for
unlawful expropriation and for breach of the FET standards under these BITs. The
Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ submissions to such effect, as summarised above: see

Professor Lowenfeld’s International Economic Law.

"° Chorzéw Factory 1928 PCI, Series A, No 17 (Merits), p. 47.

Part XII — Page 36

12-54 Market Value/Fair Market Value: The Tribunal notes that the issues under Article 5 of
the two BITs relate to the effect of the several phrases (i) “market value” of the
investment as the measure of indemnification, to include “current value, declared tax
value of tangible goods, and other criteria that are appropriate to determine market value”
(the Argentina BIT); and (ii) “fair market value or, in the absence of such value, ... the
actual value of the ... investment”, to include “going concern value, asset value including
the declared tax value of tangible property and any other criteria, which in the
circumstances, are appropriate to determine fair market value” (the France BIT). These
terms are considered by the Tribunal separately in more detail below, in Part XIII of this

Award.

12-55 DCF: Neither BIT here refers expressly to the DCF approach to valuation forming the
Claimants’ primary case on quantum, which is so strongly disputed by the Respondent. It
is necessary to consider at some length the extent to which the DCF method is
appropriate, on the facts found by the Tribunal in this case, also in the next Part XIII of

this Award.

12-56 Burden of Proof: Under international law and the BITs, the Claimants bear the overall
burden of proving the loss founding their claims for compensation. If that loss is found to
be too uncertain or speculative or otherwise unproven, the Tribunal must reject these
claims, even if liability is established against the Respondent. Again, it is necessary to

consider this general principle in more detail in the next Part XIII of this Award.

12-57 Arbitral Discretion: As indicated above, the Tribunal has experienced considerable
difficulties in deciding certain quantum issues in these arbitration proceedings. It is not
the Tribunal’s function, as an arbitration tribunal, to make a simplistic binary choice
between the very different cases advanced by the two sides. Moreover, given these
issues’ dependence on multiple findings of fact by the Tribunal, it would not even be
possible to do so in the present case, even if this Tribunal were willing to do so (which it
is not). Ultimately, the Tribunal must exercise its own arbitral discretion in assessing
compensation by reference to the applicable legal principles and the particular facts, as

determined by the Tribunal. In Chorzéw Factory, the PCIJ noted its mandate to decide

Part XII — Page 37

the issue of compensation in its own discretion based on the various valuations presented

for its consideration:

“The Court does not fail to appreciate the difficulties presented by these
two questions, difficulties which are however inherent in the special case
under consideration, and closely connected with the time that elapsed
between the dispossession and the demand for compensation, and with the
transformations of the factory and the progress made in the industry with
which the factory is concerned. In view of these difficulties, the Court
considers it preferable to endeavour to ascertain the value to be estimated
by several methods, in order to permit of a comparison and if necessary of
completing the results of the one by those of the others. The Court,
therefore, reserves every right to review the valuations referred to in the
different formulae; basing itself on the results of the said valuations and
of facts and documents submitted to it, it will then proceed to determine
the sum to be awarded to the German Government, in conformity with the
legal principles set out above.”
The Respondent invoked this passage to contend that the Tribunal, in the present case,
should consider the results of several valuation methods in determining the appropriate

sum of compensation due to the Claimants.

12-58 A similar approach was adopted in several awards of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal. In
Starrett Housing Corporation v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran’,
otherwise much invoked by the Claimants, the arbitration tribunal noted, as to assessment
of compensation, that “[i]t is generally recognized that international tribunals have a
wide margin of appreciation to make reasonable approximations in such
circumstances.”'* Specifically, the tribunal decided: “These matters are not capable of
precise quantification because they depend on the exercise of judgmental factors that are
better expressed in approximations or ranges. In these circumstances, the Tribunal must
make an overall determination of a global amount, taking account of the nature of the
forecasts involved and the various interrelationships between them. This is, indeed, what
reasonable businessmen typically do when finally determining the price they are willing

to pay in a complex transaction. Therefore, the Tribunal again steps into the shoes of the

"' Thid., pp. 53-54.

Part XII — Page 38

hypothetical reasonable businessman, and will consider what he would have done, faced

with inevitable uncertainties yet wanting to conclude a purchase.”

12-59 The Tribunal is guided by this same approach in the present case.

12-60 No Double Recovery: Lastly, the Tribunal here records the express acknowledgment
made by the Claimants in their post-hearing submissions, as to the absence of any risk of
double recovery, directly and indirectly, between amounts recoverable by the Claimants
in these arbitration proceedings and amounts recoverable by the Concessionaire in any

separate legal proceedings in Mexico (Claimants’ Post-Hearing brief, paras. 18-25):

" ‘Double recovery’

18. The Claimants' claims against the Respondent under the BITs are
jurisdictionally distinct and wholly separate from any claim for compensation
which the Concessionaire may decide to pursue against the Mexican Federal
Government in due course. Nevertheless, the Claimants appreciate the concern
that, in practical terms, they may be seen as recovering compensation for the
same acts through separate sets of proceedings. For the reasons set out below,
the Claimants consider that this is unlikely.

19. We are advised by Lic. Graham [the Claimants’ legal adviser in Mexico] that,
although the Federal Government Pecuniary Responsibility Act does not
expressly require the Administrative Court to take into consideration any award
issued by an international investment arbitral tribunal requiring the Mexican
Federal Government to pay damages ("Award"), the Mexican regime on liability
relies on the universal principle that compensation must be limited to damages
actually suffered (Federal Civil Code, Book Four, Title One, Chapter V and Title
Four, Chapter I; Federal Civil Code, Articles 1910, 1915, 2108, 2109).

20. Lic. Graham has advised that if a claim is brought under the Act, the Mexican

government would have the right to invoke the above principle to abate any
amount

previously paid as a result of the arbitral award.

21. Lic. Graham has further advised that if the Concessionaire files a claim for
damages the Administrative Court would take any Award into consideration,
failing which it would be breaching the terms of the BITs, which state that an
Award is final and binding on the State party in an arbitration.

'4 Tbid., para. 338.

Part XII — Page 39

22. In sum, Lic. Graham's conclusion is that should the Concessionaire prove any
damages before the Administrative Court, Talsud and Gemplus would not be
entitled to collect the amounts granted to Conrena [the Concessionaire]. The only
shareholder to be compensated would be Aplicaciones Informdticas S.A. de C.V
(“Aplicaciones Informdticas").

23. Separately, Lic. Zambrano [the Claimants’ legal adviser in Mexico] has also
advised that the Administrative Court would take into account any damages
awarded by this Tribunal. Lic. Zambrano has stated that the Administrative Court
would award compensation in proportion to the shareholding held by
Aplicaciones Informdticas to avoid any double recovery.

24. In view of these opinions, it appears that there is very little (if any) risk of the
Claimants making a "double recovery", as the Administrative Court will take into
account any Award when determining the quantum of any judgment.

25. In order to address any residual concern that the Tribunal might have
concerning double recovery, the Claimants are prepared to enter into a legally
binding assignment to Mexico of any and all pecuniary benefits, up to the value of
any award in damages made in this arbitration, which they may derive as
shareholders in the Concessionaire by way of dividends, distributions or
otherwise from the final outcome of the Nullity Claim and any consequent claim
for damages before the Administrative Court.”

12-61 The Tribunal has taken note of the offer made by the Claimants to the Respondent in the
last-cited paragraph above, which (so it understands) remains available for acceptance as

at the date of this Award and, doubtless, thereafter.

PART XIII: ISSUE I- COMPENSATION: LOST FUTURE PROFITS

(01) INTRODUCTION

13-1 In this part of the Award, the Tribunal considers the various methods proposed by the
Parties to calculate the appropriate amount of compensation under the respective BITs
in regard to the Claimants’ claims based on the Concessionaire’s lost future profits,
including the Claimants’ use of the DCF method and the Respondent’s use of Non-DCF

methods.

(02) THE CONCESSION’S CLASSIFICATION

13-2. The Concessionaire’s Concession is characterized by the Claimants as a highly valuable
investment, and by the Respondent as significantly less valuable, if not actually
worthless. Although the Tribunal has decided earlier in this Award that the relevant
valuation date is 24 June 2001, it is necessary to consider the Parties’ cases relating to

periods before and after this date.

Part XIII — Page 1

A. — The Claimants’ Case

13-3. The Claimants characterise the Concession for the purpose of the Tribunal’s quantum

analysis as follows (Quan. Rep. at 1-2, para. 3):

(i) as at 20 August 2000, Renave had legal rights under a renewable 10-year
Concession Agreement with the Secretariat granted on 15 September 1999
(and published in the Official Journal of the Federation on 11 May 2000),
to manage the registration of all used and new vehicles for the life of the
Concession;

(ii) in accordance with the terms of that Concession the Respondent had
introduced special legislation to make the registration of all vehicles
compulsory and granted to Renave in law the right to charge a fee for
each registration;

(iii) the Respondent had recognised and endorsed the validity of the income
stream projections in Renave’s Business Plan which formed a part of the
Concession Agreement;

(iv) the Business Plan under (endorsed by the Respondent) [sic] anticipated
gross earnings from registration fees amounting to approximately
MXN$4.6 billion and pre-tax profits of MXN$1.8 billion during the first
10-year period of the Concession;

(vy) the Concession gave rise to a legitimate expectation that significant
additional revenue could be expected from the second 10-year period of
the Concession;

(vi) the Claimants therefore made their investments on the basis of projections
of income and earnings which were formally accepted by the Mexican
State and which gave rise to legitimate expectations as to future income;

(vii) as at 20 August 2000, Renave was an established, income-producing
business which had successfully completed the execution phase of the
Concession by establishing a Registry;

(viii) after 20 August 2000, the Registry operated for more than two years,
giving rise to a record of revenue earnings as to which there is no scope
for speculation;

(ix) in 2001 and 2002 more than 95% of all new vehicles in Mexico were
registered with Renave and the assumption of 99% made by

Part XIII — Page 2

LECG/Horwath for the remainder of the Concession period has not been
challenged by the Respondent’s expert;

(x) in the 28 month period after 20 August 2000, the level of such
performance, for new vehicles, exceeded the projections for registrations
that had been set out in the Business Plan, making it clear that (i) those
projections were conservative and (ii) the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations would have been met but for the Respondent's unlawful
actions and inactions; and

(xi) The “Asociacién Mexicana de Distribuidores de Automotores” (AMDA)
has published historical figures for the number of new vehicles sold in
Mexico for the period from 2000 to 2006. These figures are not disputed
by the Respondent or its experts.”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Claimants’ set forth their submissions on the value of their investment as follows

(Quan. Mem. at 2):

“2. In brief summary, the Claimants’ case on quantum is that Renave would
have been highly profitable over the ten year life of the concession. This is
clear from the projections that were incorporated into the Concession
Agreement and from the track record for registration of new vehicles in
the period up to December 2002. The value of the Claimants’ investment,
namely their shares in Renave, would have reflected that. The result of the
interventions and other actions by the Respondent for which it incurs
liability, including the revocation of the concession, is that Renave, and
therefore the Claimants’ investment, has been rendered worthless. The
Respondent has permitted Renave to make modest distributions to its
shareholders in 2002. However, these amounts do not amount to adequate
compensation in accordance with the requirements of the Mexico-
Argentina and Mexico-France bilateral investment treaties (“the BITS”)
and the applicable rules of law.

3. The relevant principles governing compensation for the serious effects of
treaty violations and breaches of international law alleged by the
Claimants are set out below, in respect of expropriation and all other
breaches of the BITs. From these principles it is clear that the Tribunal is
required to assess the value of the concession as a whole, including any
potential future profits based on the probable performance of Renave over
the life of the concession (and any renewals). The Claimants as
shareholders in Renave are entitled to claim a proportionate part of the
value of the enterprise or the total value of the undertaking including
profit. This valuation must be made at a point in time immediately before
the alleged wrongful acts of the Respondent began to impair the value of

Part XIII — Page 3

the concession rights. It is also established that any negative effect on
valuation that may have been caused by the intervention of the
Respondent, or any earlier acts that are inconsistent with its treaty
obligations, must be excluded from the valuation.”

13-5 The Claimants calculate the total value of their lost investments as MXP $340,230,868,
excluding the value of any subsequent concession renewals, interest and costs (Quan.

Mem. at 3).

B. The Respondent’s Case

13-6 The Respondent, on the other hand, characterises the Concession for valuation purposes

as follows (Quan. Rej. at para. 7):

. “At the date of valuation, the Claimants had invested only P$28.37 million
(approximately US$3.2 million), notwithstanding the Business Plan's
projection of a total investment of P$337 million (approximately US$35
million) during 2000, 56% of which would be financed through
shareholder capital contributions. They made, as the Claimants, admit,
“something less than 100%” of the capital investment contemplated in the
Business Plan. To be accurate, it was something very substantially less

than 100%.

. Renave had an accumulated net loss of P$37.2 million (or P$44 million
depending upon which financial statement is used) at the end of August
2000.

. The Concessionaire’s investment strategy was to sub-contract the main

components of the Registry, for example, a data scanning center, and it
had the database hosted by Hewlett Packard. By the end of August 2000, it
had only P$25 million worth of fixed assets, against a planned P$300
million worth of fixed assets contemplated by the Business Plan for the
end of the first year.

. A subsequent study revealed that there was very little infrastructure that
would be transferred to the Secretariat were the contract to be terminated.

. The company’s net assets around the date of valuation were P$44.7
million and by the end of August 2000 had decreased to P$22.6 million.

Part XIII — Page 4

13-7

. For a project (now) characterized as “low risk”, the Concessionaire paid
only P$11.3 million (US$1.17 million at the then-prevailing exchange
rate) for the concession rights and agreed thereafter to make annual
payments of only P$9,000,000 (US$959,000 for year one) and
P$8,000,000 (US$870,000 annually for the next eight years). Using
LECG/Horwath’s proposed 15% discount rate, the present value of those
payments (had they all been made) amounted to only P$58.2 million. As
PRA points out in their second report, the Claimants’ P$754.7 million
valuation represents a return of 1,197% on what the Concessionaire was
prepared to pay for that “most precious asset”, as the Reply characterizes
it.

. The Claimants received back what they invested in the company. (They
quibble about whether they were made completely whole, but the evidence
is that they essentially got back the capital that they invested in Renave.)”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Respondent contends as follows with regard to the approach to valuing the

Claimants’ investments (Quan. CM at 30):

“117. There is a final factor that would have to be taken into consideration by
the Tribunal. It is Mexico’s position that with the events of 24 August-7
September 2000 the entire project came undone. There was a collapse of
public confidence and the Secretariat was obliged to step in.

118. Since the valuation exercise propounded by the Claimants involves
hypothetical scenarios and assumptions, the Tribunal might well ponder
one more: what would have happened to Renave and its investors had the
Mexican Government washed its hands of the Cavallo scandal on 24
August 2000 and instead of intervening in various ways in an effort to try
to restore public confidence, had simply required the concessionaire to
resolve it on its own?

119. In Mexico’s view, the Registry would have collapsed in a matter of days
due to widespread refusal to register vehicles with a Concessionaire
associated in the public mind with Ricardo Cavallo. The value of the
Concessionaire in such circumstances would have been zero.

120. The only reason why the Claimants were able to essentially recoup their
investments is that while the Secretariat investigated the Concessionaire’s
performance and evaluated its position, the new vehicle registration
continued long enough to permit Renave to generate enough monies to
enable the company to pay out its investors. That process was not saddled
with the loss-making used vehicles registration proc This would not
have been possible without the Secretariat’s intervention.”

 

Part XIII — Page 5

[Footnotes omitted]

13-8 The Respondent calculates that the total value of the Claimants’ claims, at most, is in
the range of MXP $2,553,129 to $3,590,360 on the basis of its proposed Expected
Returns Approach, excluding the value of any subsequent concession renewals, interest
and costs, and discounted by at least 50 % on the basis of contributory fault (Quan. CM
at 28).

(03) THE DCF METHOD

A. The Claimants’ Case

13-9 The Claimants’ expert, LECG/Horwath, calculated the value of the Claimants’

respective investments on two alternative DCF models.

13-10 First DCF Model: The first model assumes that the Concessionaire would have
continued to operate normally in accordance with the terms of the Concession
Agreement with respect to both new and used vehicles. This model is summarized as

follows (Quan. Mem. at 26-27):

“74. — First, LECG/Horwath calculated the value of the business on the
assumption that Renave would have continued to operate normally in
accordance with the terms of the Concession Agreement in relation to
both new and used vehicles. This calculation is summarised at Schedule 1
to the LECG/Horwath Report. LECG/Horwath proceeded as follows:

(i) Almost all new vehicles would have been registered (this was
compulsory, and LECG/Horwath have assumed a rate of 99%).
For each vehicle, a registration fee would have been paid. This
occurred in practice until December 2002, and LECG/Horwath
were therefore able to use the actual figures for registration of new
vehicles for that period. For the period from December 2002 to
December 2006, LECG/Horwath used figures provided by AMDA
specifying the number of new vehicles which would have been

Part XIII — Page 6

75.

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

registered. Finally, LECG/Horwath have assumed that the market
for new vehicles will grow, for the period 2007-2010, at the same
rate as it grew during the period 2000-2006.

Under this first model, all owners of used vehicles would also have
remained subject to the obligation to register their vehicles. Again,
for each registration, a fee would have been paid. LECG/Horwath
have proceeded on the basis that the registrations would have
taken place in accordance with the figures in the Business Plan,
which were based on the information provided by the Respondent
(as to the number of vehicles in Mexico at the time the concession
was granted) and agreed by the Respondent as part of the
Concession Agreement. They consider this to be an accurate, but
conservative, estimate of what would have occurred.

Finally, once a vehicle was registered, fees would have been paid
for subsequent transactions (such as change of owner) in
accordance with the Business Plan. LECG/Horwath refer to these
registrations as “other categories”. Again, LECG/Horwath
proceeded on the basis of the figures in the Business Plan. They
consider that these figures represent the best estimate (although
conservative) of the rate at which the other categories of
registration would have occurred and the income this would have
generated. This is extremely conservative, because LECG/Horwath
did not consider the additional transactions that would have
occurred as a result of the much faster than anticipated growth (as
between the Business Plan and what happened in reality) in
Mexico’s new vehicle market.

LECG/Horwath then deducted from the income the expenses
attributable to each aspect of Renave’s business. Where this was
available, they relied on actual data. In the absence of such data,
they relied on the figures in the Business Plan and figures provided
by Maria Elena Barrera, Director of Finance and Administration
of Renave.

LECG/Horwath applied tax at the applicable rate for each year

then made adj leductions for deprecit tization.

Finally, LECG/Horwath applied a discount rate of 15% to reflect the time
value of money and risks for Renave as at 20 August 2000. In summary,
they adopted an additive model in which the return on an asset is
estimated as the sum of a risk-free rate and one or more risk premia. In
reaching the final figure of 15%, they took into account the following
factors:

Part XIII — Page 7

13-11

13-12

(i) the risk-free rate of return based on 10-year constant maturity U.S.
treasuries (since any risky investment should return at least as
much as the riskless asset);

(ii) the U.S. long-horizon equity risk premium for the period 1926 to
2000 (to reflect the additional return an investor requires for
investing in equities as opposed to riskless assets);

(iii) an industry/firm specific risk premium; and

(iv) — a country risk premium factor of 333 basis points at August 21,
2000, to capture the difference between rates of return on
government bonds in Mexico as opposed to the U.S. and to factor
the additional premium required by investors on that date for
Mexican investments.”

[Footnotes omitted]

Second DCF Model: The second model assumes that, as actually occurred, the
obligation on owners of used vehicles to register those vehicles was suspended in
August/September 2000. This calculation “follows the same logic as the calculation for
used and new cars, but does not take into account the income derived from the
registration of used cars and other categories. It also makes adjustments to deduct
expenses related solely to the part of Renave’s business engaged with the registration of

used cars” (Quan. Mem. at 28).

In response to the Respondent’s criticism of the use of the DCF method, the Claimants

reply as follows (Quan. Rep. at 9-11):

“22. The Respondent’s critique of LECG’s valuation is largely based on the
proposition that the Claimants’ valuation is based upon the hypothetical
notion of the price which a willing buy[er] would pay to a willing seller
and that it is not permissible to rely on data that was not available at the
date of valuation. The approach is designed to introduce a very significant
qualification to the factual basis that may be relied upon to value the
shares in Renave. The Respondent seeks to limit the number of years of
Renave’s operations that can be considered in order then to argue that
there is no established practice on which to assess income and
profitability. This is the central strategy of the Respondent's Counter-
Memorial on Quantum: the Respondent's primary contention is that
Renave’s lack of a “track record” of profitable operations at the time of
valuation precludes the use of the DCF valuation. The Respondent seeks

Part XIII — Page 8

23.

24.

25,

to construct an argument that the investment was too speculative. The
approach is misconceived.

It is this proposition that underpins a substantial part of the PRA report.
Thus, for example:-

(a) In commenting on the limitations of the DCF methodology, PRA
asserts that Renave has no reliable historical performance record
or “track record” as of the valuation date. That assertion cannot
be made in relation to Renave’s historical performance as a whole,
a performance that was based on the assumptions that
underpinned the Business Plan and the arrangements put in to
place by the Claimants;

(b) PRA asserts that, as of the valuation date, virtually no historical
data is available to validate future cash-flow projections;

(c) PRA asserts that a due diligence investigation performed by a
hypothetical willing buyer could only be performed based on the
information available as of the valuation date; and

(d) PRA asserts that the hypothetical willing buyer would not have
been able to take into account the information included in the
LECG/Horwath model, such as the number of new vehicle
registrations reported by AMDA during 2007 and Renave’'s
audited financial statements for 2000 or 2001.

In making this argument the Respondent draws a wholly artificial and
untenable distinction between the track record as at the valuation date, as
referred to above, and the actual track record based on established facts.
The Respondent’s approach is self-contradictory. The Respondent is
happy to refer in the Counter Memorial to new vehicle registrations which
continued long enough to permit Renave to generate funds to pay as
dividends to its investors, but it does not wish to refer to the same facts for
the purposes of valuing the investment. There is no dispute between the
parties that about 2.2 million new vehicles were registered by Renave
from inception up to the Revocation of the Concession in December 2002.
The Respondent cannot say - and it does not say - that there was no track
record. Rather, it argues that the Tribunal should not look at how the
investment actually performed after the Respondent's initial and unlawful
act of interference in August 2000. The Respondent seeks, in effect, to rely
on its own wrong-doing to minimise the compensation that is due.

The Claimants submit that the Respondent's approach is ill-conceived and
should be rejected. There has been a widespread acceptance of lost gain
or loss of profit as a legitimate element for measuring the amount of
compensation that is due. The approach is supported by the terms of the

Part XIII — Page 9

13-13

13-14

The Claimants identify additional reasons why the DCF methods ought to apply in this
case, including substantial consensus on valuation data. The Claimants submit that
LECG/Horwath have relied upon projections in the Business Plan, “which were agreed
between the parties and enshrined in the Concession Agreement.” The Claimants also
note that an approved business plan is an acceptable part of a DCF valuation and

“reinforces the likelihood of the damages suffered by the Claimants” (Quan. Rep., para.

two BITs, which allow reference to be made to all appropriate criteria in
assessing compensation. In this case, it is accepted by all the parties that
there was no open market for the shares in Renave. As stated in the
Claimants’ First Memorial on Quantum, the Claimants’ experts proceed
on the basis that there was no existing business comparable to Renave and
there had been no arm’s length transaction from which they derived an
estimate of Renave’s value. The parties are driven to the fiction of a
hypothetical buyer and seller by the terms of the BITs which equate
compensation with the market value of the investment. It does not follow
that the Tribunal should ignore what would otherwise be material,
accessible and verifiable information about the prospects for future profit.
The Respondent's approach is unrealistic and unfair and undermines the
intention of the drafters of the BITs and the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations as to how they would be interpreted and applied.”

40 at 16).

It is further submitted by the Claimants that the DCF method is the only “fair and proper

way” to value the Claimants’ loss. In this respect, the Claimants submit that (Quan.

Rep. at 17-18):

“42.

43.

[...] international tribunals have used the DCF method where, as in the
present case, it is possible on the basis of verifiable data to predict the
income that would be generated by the investment. Tribunals have only
resorted to other techniques when it was not possible to use DCF because
the methodology was based on speculative assumptions or there was a
history of lack of profitability...

In this case, there are clear reasons why the Tribunal can validly make
use of the DCF method:

(i) the damage is not speculative, and the facts and assumptions on

which LECG/Horwath rely are sufficiently certain to make such an
approach appropriate; and

Part XIII — Page 10

13-15

13-16

(ii) the alternative valuation methods put forward by PRA (which
LECG/Horwath considered and rejected) do not allow Renave’s
key asset, namely its predictable income stream under the terms of
the Concession Agreement, to be taken into account, as referred to
in more detail below”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Claimants’ expert, LECG/Horwath, also responded to PRA’s criticisms of its DCF
approach, in preference for the Concessionaire’s ‘book value’, as follows (LECG

Second Expert Report at 10):

“15. ... [t]he crucial issue in the valuation of Renave’s shares is the income stream
flowing from operating the Registry as a going concern. The most important asset
in the valuation of Renave’s shares is the intangible right to the concession, to
operate the Registry, and to receive the financial benefits from the investment.
These financial benefits exist during the initial ten-year terms and any subsequent
renewal of the concession and do not accrue to any tangible asset. Consequently,
the income stream is the central consideration in valuing the shares in Renave. By
focusing only on the book value of tangible assets and cash contributions, the
PRA Report ignores the principal source of value.”

The Claimants and LECG/Horwath undertook an additional valuation of the Claimants’
investment as of 26 June 2001 and 12 December 2002 using the same model as relied
on in their previous damages submissions resulting in the following calculations

As regards PTU, during the main hearing, the Claimants conceded that a correction
should be made to their DCF model concerning PTU (which has to do with the profit

sharing plan for the Concessionaire’s employees) [D7:1645]. On the final day of the

These calculations have been adjusted to take account of the concession
made by the Claimants concerning PTU tax and as advised to the
Respondent's counsel during the hearing by e-mail dated 23 February
2008.

The above is a summary of the values derived by LECG from the
Claimants’ investment, which equates to the value of their shares in
Renave. This is measured as the value of the business of Renave using the
DCF approach, taking into account actual and projected revenues from
fees from three income streams, as applicable, these being from (a) from
the initial registration from new and used vehicles, (b) subsequent
transfers of ownership and (c) other transactions for which fees are
payable.”

hearing, the Claimants submitted a revised schedule, adjusting the manner in

Part XIII — Page 12

 

which PTU was reflected in their damages model. The Respondent confirmed in its
closing submissions at the hearing that it did not oppose the Claimants’ correction,
reiterating that its main objection was to the Claimants’ use of the DCF model generally
[D8:1903]. The PTU adjustment was taken into account by the Claimants in their post-
hearing submissions and reflected in the alternative damages calculations presented by
the Claimants for the Tribunal’s alternative valuation dates, ie. June 2001 and

December 2002 [Post-Hearing Br. at para. 73].

13-18 Finally, the Claimants request that all compensation awarded to them be denominated in
US dollars, using an exchange rate as of the date of the Award (Claimants’ Post-

Hearing Br., para. 76 at 20).

B. The Respondent’s Case

13-19 The Respondent expresses the following reservations as to the application of any DCF
model, characterising it as a legal fiction inapplicable to the present case (Quan. CM at

17):

“356. The First Memorial on Quantum cites a passage from an award of the
Tran-U.S. Claims Tribunal on the market value of an untraded asset. In
Starrett Housing, the tribunal noted that the price is that which a willing
buyer will pay to a willing seller in circumstances in which each had good
information and each desired to maximize his financial gain.

57. The test assumes that the arm’s length would-be purchaser would have
access to the key financial and operational documents generated by the
company and its management in order to determine whether to proceed
with the purchase and at what price. The would-be purchaser would have
access to the company’s financial statements, its bank records,
management's discussion of its prospects, etc. In other words, the
hypothetical purchaser is presumed to know what the Concessionaire’s
senior management knew about the financial status of the company, its
performance under the Title of Concession and its prospects.

58. These are important points which warrant emphasizing: the test is a legal
fiction that assumes that on the valuation date, the purchaser is well and

Part XIII — Page 13

fully appraised of all relevant information about the proposed purchase
and can therefore make an informed decision. The test also assumes that
while the seller will want to maximize the sales price, the purchaser will
focus on the principle features of the proposed transaction that would
result in a reduction of the sales price.”

13-20 The Respondent then proceeds to identify what any fictional would-be purchaser would
know following a review of the Concessionaire’s internal corporate information, as of
20 August 2000, claiming that these facts alone would have raised serious questions

about the “wisdom” of purchasing the Concessionaire (Quan. CM at 18-20, para. 61):

. “First, the purchaser would be aware that the Claimants themselves had
characterized the project as being of “high risk” from the outset. This in
itself calls for a large discount in the price a potential buyer would be
willing to pay, especially considering that some of those risks had
materialized as of 20 August 2000.

. Second, the purchaser would discover that only 6 weeks before 20 August
2000, the Board had authorized the retention of the Electronic Data
Systems (EDS) to conduct the technical audit of Renave’s database and
operating systems due to “doubts” about their performance. Since this
was the Concessionaire’s key asset and on whose secure and proper
operation the longevity of the Title of Concession depended, if the seller
was having its doubts about the database’s operation, concerns would
perforce be raised in the would-be purchaser’s mind about what would
have to be done to make the database properly operational.

. Third, the purchaser would find that the company itself did not have an
accurate understanding of its own financial and operational prospects.
The Board minutes reveal that although repeatedly promised to the Board,
over the course of the summer of 2000, Renave’s Financial Directorship
was unable to prepare a detailed presentation on the company’s
performance for the Board’s review. A would-be purchaser would have
doubts about buying a company which lacked an accurate understanding
of its own operations. The purchaser would be unable to run its own DCF
valuation on the “actual numbers” due to the absence of the necessary
data, and therefore could not test Renave’s actual performance against its
Business Plan projections.

. Fourth, the purchaser would be aware of the changes in the company’s
management and administration in July-August 2000: Mr. Taiariol
resigned as Commercial Director and Mr Alec Davis was appointed as the
Board member to oversee the company’s financial and administrative
functions due to Board concerns about Mr. Cavallo’s performance. In
short, the Talsud representatives, who were represented in the bid as the

Part XIII — Page 14

individuals with substantial prior experience in the motor vehicle registry
business, were being shunted aside by the majority shareholder.

Fifth, the would-be purchaser would be aware of the extent to which the
company had sub-contracted key functions to third parties and the
correspondingly modest investment in physical assets made by the
shareholders. It would note that the existing shareholders had hitherto
sought (unsuccessfully) to finance its operations from existing cash flows.
These facts would raise doubts about the would-be sellers’ confidence in
their investment and their willingness to put their own capital at risk. The
would-be purchaser could reasonably conclude that if the shareholders
(including Henry Davis Signoret) had only been prepared to put some
US$6.6 million at risk, they could not have had a substantial expectation
to be paid some US$82 million.

Sixth, and related to the foregoing point, it is common ground between
parties that the investors made a much smaller capital investment than
that contemplated by the Title of Concession’s Program of Investment.
The would-be purchaser would also take note of that underperformance.
This would raise questions of whether the Concessionaire was in breach
of any of its contractual commitments to the Secretariat.

The under-commitment of capital could be a breach of the Title of
Concession. It would be exemplary of a more general contingency that
any purchaser would factor into the deal: given that this was a grant of a
monopoly to provide a public service and was subject to extensive
governmental involvement through the Title of Concession and its legal
framework, there would always be a risk that at some point the Secretariat
could form the view that it was appropriate to exercise its legal rights
under the contract. No seller could warrant that the 10 year term was a
certainty because it could not warrant that the Secretariat would never
form the view that the concessionaire was in breach of the Title of
Concession.

Seventh, Renave’s relationships with its principle suppliers which
provided the major components of the data collection and hosting (i.e.,
collection of registration applications, data scanning, and data base
hosting) were unsettled. In fact, it was unable to finalize the contracts for
the purchase of the smart cards from its own shareholder Gemplus.

Eighth, and related to the company’s subcontracting strategy, the
purchaser would note the very high indebtedness, which heightened the
project’s risk. The debt to equity ratio in July was 1.97. The same ratio
by the end of August was 5.3 (i.e., debt was 5.3 times greater than the
shareholder's equity).

Part XIII — Page 15

13-21

13-22

. Ninth, given that the Concession was predicated on a nation-wide system
of documentary processing centers and, as recognized in Mr. Davis’ letter
of 14 July 2000 to Dr. Ramos, the cost of registration had already raised
questions about the system’s viability, the purchaser would question how
registration data would be collected if the CTD system were to be less
robust than originally contemplated or even non-existent, and whether
that would entail higher costs to it if it had to a find a new means of
collecting used vehicle registrations nation-wide.

. Tenth, a would-be purchaser would be aware of the bank’s concerns about
the company’s prospects and of the majority shareholder’s concerns about
the investors’ exposure to claims on various guarantees given to suppliers
and others.

. Eleventh, a prospective buyer would be acquiring a minority of interest in
the company. Normally, the purchase of a minority interest commands a
discount.

. Finally, a potential buyer would examine the need to make additional

capital contributions to the company and factor this into its offer. The
available financial information indicates that the Concessionaire had a
significant working capital deficit which called for either increased debt
or additional capital contributions (which were in fact made towards the
end of 2000).””

[Footnotes omitted]

The Respondent also contends that the external environment in which the
Concessionaire was operating would introduce commercial uncertainty into the fictional

would-be buyer’s calculation of the purchase price (Quan. CM at 21).

Based on all these factors, the Respondent submits that a fully informed arm’s length
purchaser contemplating the purchase of a 49% stake in the Concessionaire would
demand “a very high discount”. The Respondent submits that, in such circumstances,
the DCF model fails to capture any fictional purchase and sale agreement for the

Concessionaire (Quan. CM at 21-22):

“69. A DCF valuation is simplistic in that assumes [sic] a fully consummated,
irrevocable agreement with no ability to vary or terminate the deal if the
business did not unfold as predicted. In this respect, it is very much a
fiction.

Part XIII — Page 16

13-23

13-24

70. Much more likely in the real world of commerce, the purchaser faced with
the facts as outlined above would agree to pay a small sum as an up-front
payment and then make progress or “earn out” payments if certain
contractually stipulated targets were met. In PRA’s view, this would be a
far more likely way of proceeding.

71. The value of such a contract from the purchaser’s perspective is that the
seller would shoulder the burden of the risk. Given the facts reviewed
above, it is Mexico’s position that a would-be purchaser, if it was willing
to commit any capital at all to the project, would be most unwilling to
make a substantial up-front payment. Rather, it would make a small
payment and then promise to pay milestone payments, if the milestones
were met.”

[Footnotes omitted]

In view of the material events, i.e. beginning with the Cavallo incident onwards, the
Respondent submits that any fictional purchaser would likely also have demanded the
rescission of the purchase and sale agreement on or after any relevant date for valuation

purposes (Quan. CM at 23).

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent identifies what, in its view, represents a significant
shift in the approach taken by the Claimants’ experts, to address what the fictional

purchaser and seller could have known at the relevant time (Quan. Rej. at paras. 36-37):

“36. — [...] In this first report, they undertook to “give our opinion on the market
value, as of August 20, 2000, of the Claimants’ shares in the company ....”
Mexico responded that if market value is being established, the focus must
be on what the purchaser and seller could have known at the time. In their
second report, the Claimants’ experts shift to providing a “calculation of
the lost profits to the Claimants (as distinct from the market value of the
shares in Renave held by the Claimants) as of August 20, 2000” and to
give an opinion on “the market value of the Claimants shares as of
December 12, 2002.”

37. This shift, it is submitted, is intended to allow the experts to move [...]
explicitly to a lost profits analysis and to thereby invoke the sources which
permit the use of ex post information. Having done so, they then contend
that their lost profits calculation is equivalent to a market value analysis
(even though they themselves characterized it as being distinct from
one).””

[Respondent’s emphasis; footnotes omitted]

Part XIII — Page 17

13-25

13-26

13-27

In addition to its general objection to any reliance on the DCF model to value the
Claimants’ investments, the Respondent takes issue with certain aspects of
LECG/Horwath’s analysis, which it claims increase the estimated value of the
Concessionaire by approximately MXP$673 million (Quan. CM at 24). In particular, the
Respondent challenges five aspects of LECG/Horwath’s analysis: (1) “unverified
assumptions”; (2) “information not available to a hypothetical willing buyer”; (3) the

discount rate; (4) taxes; and (5) the discounting period.

The Respondent contends that LECG/Horwath’s analysis contains several assumptions
that cannot be corroborated but all of which tend to overstate the value of the

Concessionaire (Quan. CM at 24):

“84. [...] For example, LECG/Horwath assumes the per unit cost of registering
used and new vehicles to be $4.46 pesos and $53.52 pesos respectively.

85. These figures are said to be based on an estimate prepared by Ms. Maria
Elena Barrera, however, Ms. Barrera has not offered any testimony in this
phase of the proceedings; her analysis is not included as an exhibit to
either the First Memorial on Quantum or to the LECG/Horwath report;
the documents on which she relied to arrive at such estimates have not
been identified or produced, and therefore, this important part of
LECG/Horwath analysis is not supported by any evidence.

86. In order to test the reasonableness of said assumptions, PRA compared
the Net Income Before Taxes as projected by LECG/Horwath against
Renave’s original projections and found that they are between 1.6 and 3.1
higher than the original projections. PRA concludes, based on the limited
information available on this issue, that the cost estimates used by the
Claimants’ expert appears to be biased in favour of overstating the value
of Renave.”

The Respondent also contends that LECG/Horwath has used information that could not

have been available to a hypothetical willing buyer, thereby transgressing the

Claimants’ own definition of market value (Quan. CM at 25):

“88. As explained in Section B.5.2 of the PRA report, LECG/Horwath relies on
information from Renave’s audited financial statements for 2000-2002 to
determine revenues and costs related to new car registrations, AMDA’s
statistics on car sales for 2002-2006 to determine Renave’s revenues from
new car registrations, and project car sales forward using observed
growth rates from those years.

Part XIII — Page 18

13-28

89.

90.

It also uses other information, such as the actual corporate tax rate for
2001-2007, notwithstanding that this information could not have been
known in the summer of 2000 and therefore could not have been
incorporated into the willing buyer’s assessment of value.

To illustrate this point: the hypothetical willing buyer would have likely
taken Renave’s original expectations regarding new car registrations as a
basis to evaluate Renave’s revenue potential. However, he would not
have based the price he was willing to pay on the expectation that car
sales would increase between 82% and 102% beyond Renave’s original
projections. Likewise, he would not have expected the corporate tax rate
to fall from 35% to 33% and factor this into the price.”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Respondent also challenges the discount rate used by LECG/Horwath to assess the
value of Claimants’ shares in the Concessionaire, contending that the rates exceed two
benchmarks of reasonable discount rates, i.e. the risk-free interest rate in Mexico

(CETES) and the interest rate charged on the Concessionaire’s long-term debt with

INVEX (Quan. CM at 25):

“92.

93.

94.

95.

Given the fact that Renave, as an investment, carried considerably more
risk than a government-backed certificate, such as CETES, it stands [to]
reason that an investor would demand a higher return from Renave than it
would from CETES. Hence, the discount rate used in a DCF valuation of
Renave, which represents the rate of return acquired by the investor,
should be higher than the CETES rate, not 2 points below that rate as
LECG/Horwath suggests.

The second reference point offered by PRA is the interest rate charged on
Renave’s long-term debt with INVEX. Since creditors have a preferential
claim over the company’s assets in case of a liquidation, they face a lower
risk than the shareholders. For that reason, creditors are willing to lend
funds at a lower rate than that demanded by the shareholders in the same
company. It logically follows that the discount rate in this case (i.e., the
cost of equity) should be higher than the interest rate charged by INVEX.

In its credit agreement with Renave executed in March 2000 (before the
external operating problems arose), INVEX charged between 23% and
26%. Yet the discount used in the Claimants’ DCF analysis is only 15%.
According to PRA, an investor would necessarily demand a higher return
to compensate for the additional risk borne vis-a-vis the creditor INVEX.

In regard to the Build-Up Method (the method employed by
LECG/Horwath to determine the discount rate) PRA points out that,

Part XIII — Page 19

13-29

13-30

13-31

although it is commonly used to determine discount rates, it can be easily
manipulated and could lead to unrealistic results. As an example PRA
states that if Renave was alternatively classified under “Computer
Programming, Data Processing, and Other Computer Services” (instead
of as a “Consumer Credit Reporting Agencies, Mercantile Reporting
Agencies and Adjustments and Collections Agencies” (as LECG/Horwath
does) instead of arriving at a 15% discount rate, the Build-Up Method
would yield a 24.5% discount rate.”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Respondent concludes that a proper discount rate would fall between 26%, i.e., the
interest rate paid on the Concessionaire’s long-term debt, and 31%, i.e., the low end of
the rate of return “usually required by venture capitalists when investing in start-up

companies” (Quan. CM at 26).

The Respondent claims the following two errors were made by LECG/Horwath in
relation to the PTU (i.e., worker participation in RENAVE’s profits) and corporate taxes
(Quan. CM at 26-27):

“99. PRA indicates in their report that LECG/Horwath incorrectly treated the
carry-forward loss as a positive cash flow (a negative tax) for the year
2000, thereby having the effect of increasing the cash flow in that year,
and thereby increasing the estimated value of Renave. PRA points out
that the carry-forward loss does not reduce the cash outflow in the year it
is generated (as if the tax authorities reimbursed companies for the losses
they incur), rather it reduces payable taxes (thus enhancing the cash flow)
in future years when the company generates profits, and therefore has to
pay taxes.

100. Furthermore, PRA states that LECG/Horwath incorrectly added up the
[PTU] (10%) and the corporate tax (35%) to calculate the carry-forward.
PRA explains that the PTU is due only if the company reports profits.
There is no carry-forward provision for PTU and therefore the company
cannot reduce its tax liability in future years by carrying-forward losses
from previous years.”

The Claimants later took into account these corrections in relation to PTU in calculating

their claims: see above.

Part XIII — Page 20

13-32 The Respondent concludes that LECG/Horwath has overstated the value of the
Concessionaire by approximately MXP$27 million by discounting cash flows six
months in advance of the date on which, according to the Respondent’s expert PRA,

they would normally be discounted (Quan. CM at 27).

13-33 As regards the Claimants’ “different damages assessments”, the Respondent claims

these all present “significant shortcomings” (Quan. Rej. at para 90):

. “The discount rate used by LECG/Horwath (15%) is too low, is
inconsistent with the prevailing market conditions at the time, and is based
on an unjustified assumption regarding Renave’s industry-specific risk. In
PRA’s opinion the appropriate discount rate would fall between 26% and
31%.

. LECG/Horwath’s cost projections are unreliable. They are based on Ms.
Barrera’s estimates which not only cannot be verified, since no supporting
documentation was provided, but they also are inconsistent with the
audited financial statements for 2001 and 2002 (that LECG/Horwath
themselves use in their analysis).

. LECG/Horwath did not take into account the fixed costs associated with
used vehicle registrations. The cost estimates submitted with Ms.
Barrera’s second witness statement suggest the fixed costs were P$26.2
million. However, LECG/Horwath calculated the total costs of used
vehicle registration by multiplying the variable cost (P$53.52) by the
number of expected registrations. This omission adds P$146.2 million to
the estimated value of Renave.

. LECG/Horwath discounts cash flows as if they were received in the middle
of the year. This would be equivalent to assuming that the shareholders
would receive 86 dividend payments during the year, and has the effect of
adding P$57 million to the estimated value of Renave.

. LECG/Horwath’s inflation adjustment is incorrect. It was anticipated that
fees would be adjusted each year for yearly inflation minus 2 points.
LECG/Horwath adjust for inflation (without any reduction), thus
overstating Renave’s revenues by P$387 million.”

13-34 The Respondent concludes with the following submission in its Rejoinder on Quantum

(Quan. Rej., paras. 22, 55 and 92-93):

Part XIII — Page 21

“22.

Without having to register used vehicles for P$25 (against a cost of a least
P$53), and receiving P$375 for a new vehicle registration (against a cost
of P$39, according to the Claimants’ evidence), the economics of the
operation changed. That is what the intervener was noting when he
addressed the “result of the several measures applied to the operation”
and the “partial view”. As discussed further below, Mexico's point is that
the Registry that existed on 20 August 2000 differed fundamentally from
15 September 2000 until December 2002.

[ou]

In the period 24 August to 15 September 2000, the Registry was thus
transformed from being a comprehensive new and used motor vehicle
registry with the prospect of being gradually implemented at the state
level through coordination agreements (once the cost of registration
issued was resolved with the states), to being solely a new vehicle registry
as the Secretariat responded to the crisis of public confidence in Renave
and the widespread public, state and legislative opposition thereto. The
Tribunal can easily conclude on the record evidence that without
Secretariat intervention and were Renave left to make out its own defence,
the project would have collapsed, in which case no post-intervention
revenues would have been generated, and the Claimants would not have
recovered their capital contributions.

[ou]

In summary, a damages claim cannot ignore the circumstances
surrounding an investment. In the instant case the project faced a number
of risks as of the date of valuation which had nothing to do with the acts of
Renave’s counterparty, the Secretariat. The project faced adverse
conditions: the public considered a fee charged for used vehicle
registration to be excessive: the public was reticent to provide personal
information; a number of state governments stated in July-August 2000
that they would not participate in the project as then conceived; and the
Federal District (DF) government vehemently opposed the private
concessioning of the Registry (and later seized upon the Cavallo scandal
as proof of the rightness of its earlier opposition). These externalities
shaped and threatened the project's prospects. They were all independent
of the acts of the Secretariat which, up to and including the date of
valuation, was striving to implement the project and to address those
externalities.

The Secretariat’s interventions commencing on 24 August 2000 did not
occur in a vacuum. What was proving to be difficult to implement became
impossible. Without Secretariat intervention, the project would have
collapsed in September 2000.”

Part XIII — Page 22

13-35 Finally, the Respondent contends that, if selected, the DCF method must, at a minimum,

be checked against the results of other valuation methods (Quan. CM at 14):

“42. The evidence is that around the time of the Claimants’ chosen valuation
date, Renave’s net asset value (i.e., shareholders equity) was
$44,718,656.19 pesos (or $15,927,772.58 pesos, depending on which
financial statements are used). By the end of August, the Concessionaire’s
net asset value was reduced to P$22,656,466.57 pesos (about half of what
it was in July 2000).

43. As combined 49% shareholders, the Claimants’ share of the
Concessionaire’s net asset value would be $21,912,141.53 pesos, or
roughly US$2.4 million. This stands in stark contrast with the US$40
million dollars that, according to LECG/Horwath, the Claimants’ 49%
share in Renave was worth (without considering renewals) as of 20
August 2000. LECG/Horwath’s value assessment also stands in stark
contrast with the P$30 million (US$3.2 million dollars) they invested in
the project as of that date.

44, LECG/Horwath’s calculation yields a value that is over 17 times the net
asset value of the company in July and over 46 times its net asset value by
the end of August 2000. It is also more than 12 times the Claimants’
actual investment in the company. The Tecmed claimant's DCF
calculation was also 12 times the actual investment and, as has been seen,
that created too great a disparity in that tribunal’s view.

45. According to the company’s tax returns for 1999 and 2000, the declared
tax value of tangible assets was P$38,845,434 and P$142,976,895 pesos,

respectively.”

(04) NON-DCF METHODS

A. The Claimants’ Case

13-36 In its preliminary engagement letter, LECG/Horwath described the Concessionaire’s
market value, as of 31 December 2004, as follows, based on its ‘book value’ (LECG

October 7 Letter paras. 12-14):

“72. Renave currently has 10,000 shares of common stock issued and
outstanding comprised of 5,100 shares of Series A, 2,900 shares of Series
B, and 2,000 shares of Series C common stock, with a nominal par value
per share of MXN $ 1,000. Talsud holds 2,900 shares of Series B common
with a nominal par value of MXN $ 1,000. Gemplus holds 2,000 shares of
Series C common with a nominal par value of MXN $ 1,000. These
represent respectively 29% and 20% of the issued and outstanding share
capital of Renave.

13. We have analyzed the accounts of Renave for the year ended December
31, 2004, the last period for which the Claimants have been provided
financial statements. A summary of these accounts appears in Schedules 3
and 3a. Based on our understanding that the concession to operate
Registry [sic] has been revoked and there being no other business
undertaken by Renave, we believe that the book values reflected in the
accounts of Renave are an accurate measure of the current market value
of the shares in Renave. Renave is not a going concern and the
appropriate premise of value is liquidation value, this being the net
amount that can be realized if the business is terminated and the assets
are sold piecemeal. For the year ended December 31, 2004, Renave
reported a net loss of MXN $ 5,143, 528. As of December 31, 2004, the net
book value (assets minus liabilities) of Renave is MXN $ 12,363,193.

14. Based on the net book value of Renave and the Claimants’ respective
ownership percentages, as of December 31, 2004, the market value of
Talsud’s shares is MXN §$ 3,585,326 and the market value of Gemplus’
shares is MXN $ 2,472,639. Applying the current rate of exchange of USD
= MXN $ 10.8, the market value of Talsud’s shares is USD $ 331,975 and
the market value of Gemplus’ shares is USD $ 228,948. Assuming that the
current pattern of expenses continues and that the capitalization of Renave
remains the same, Renave will eventually become insolvent and no value
will be realized from the liquidation of its assets.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-37. LECG/Horwath was instructed at this initial stage to estimate only a present day value

of the shareholders’ interest in the Concessionaire, i.e. on 31 December 2004.

13-38 The Claimants made the following submissions in their Memorial on Quantum rejecting
several methodologies, including the ‘Market Approach’ and the ‘Asset Approach’, in
favour of the DCF ‘Income Approach’ (Quan. Mem. at 17-19):

“42. Where there exists an active market for the expropriated asset, its market
value is the asset’s actual value on that market. Where, as in the present
case, an asset is not publicly traded and there is no open market for it, its
value typically falls to be established by reference to its likely value on a
hypothetical market.

43. According to the Iran United States Claims Tribunal’s decision in Starrett
Housing Corp. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran, the market value of an
untraded asset is:-

“the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in
circumstances in which each had good information, each desired
to maximize his financial gain, and neither was under duress or
threat.”

44, This approach has been widely endorsed by international arbitral
tribunals that have awarded damages for breach of investment treaties.

45. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal has repeatedly relied on an
assets’ likely value in a hypothetical market. So have ICSID tribunals.
Moreover, in its 1992 Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct
Investment, the World Bank also endorsed that approach, defining market
value as:-

“an amount that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing
seller after taking into account the nature of the investment, the
circumstances in which it would operate in the future and its
specific characteristics, including the period in which it has been
in existence, the proportion of tangible assets in the total
investment and other relevant factors pertinent to the specific
circumstances of each case.”

46. LECG/Horwath considered the various valuation methods potentially
available to establish this amount. They considered three methods: the

Part XIII — Page 25

Market or Comparable Approach, the Asset or Cost Approach, and the
Income Approach.

47. LECG/Horwath deemed the Market Approach unsuitable to value Renave
as there is no existing business comparable to Renave and there has been
no arm’s length transaction from which to derive an estimate of Renave’s
value.

48. LECG/Horwath excluded the Asset Approach as it would not take into
account the full earning potential of Renave and would therefore not
reflect accurately the price that a willing buyer and a willing seller would
have agreed.

49. It is therefore LECG/Horwath’s conclusion that the Income Approach,
which relies on a discounted cash flow method model, is the most
appropriate and accurate method to value the Claimants’ investment. This
approach is particularly appropriate to the valuation of a business such as
Renave where the market value of the investment would have been
dependent on its ability to generate return to its owners. Furthermore,
LECG/Horwath had access to reliable data to carry out such a valuation.
Precise data was available for the operating period of the Registry. A
Business Plan had been submitted with the bid documents, approved by
Mexico and incorporated into the Concession Agreement. Audited
historical financial statements of Renave for the years ended 31 December
2000 and 2001 were available. Detailed statistics regarding the number of
new motor vehicles put in circulation each year in Mexico are kept and
made available by AMDA, the leading Mexican trade association
providing data on vehicles sales in Mexico. The Income Approach is
therefore the only appropriate and reliable method to value the
Claimants’ investment.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-39 These submissions are supported by LECG/Horwath’s first expert report. In its review
of the Concessionaire’s financial history, LECG/Horwath noted as follows (LECG First

Quantum Report at 6-7):

“14. Audited accounts were prepared for Renave by KPMG for the initial
period September 6, 1999 to December 31, 1999 and by Deloitte &
Touche for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 2001. We were also
provided drafts of Deloitte & Touche audit reports with accompanying
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003, and
2004.

1S. For the initial period September 6, 1999 to December 31, 1999 and for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004, Renave

Part XIII — Page 26

13-40

reported gross revenues of MXN $ 0, $ 199,952,900, $ 327,099,242, $
358,849,805, $ 4,905,407 and $ 949,737 respectively. For the same
periods, Renave reported net income (losses) before taxes of MXN $
(13,262,390), $ (68,057,263), $ 123,517,148, $ 131,733,983, $
(25,782,235), and $ (5,143,528), respectively. A summary of Renave’s
financial statements is set out in Schedule 13 and I3a. It can be seen that
gross revenues and net income for the period after December 31, 2002
were relatively insignificant, reflecting the termination of the
concession.”

[Footnotes omitted]

In the Claimants’ reply on quantum, the Claimants submitted the following with regard

to alternative valuation methodologies (Quan. Rep. at 3-5):

“Ss. Together with its Counter Memorial on Quantum the Respondent
submitted a report from Pablo Rién y Asociados, S.A. de C.V. (“PRA”).
This purports to criticise the LECG/Horwath valuation on which the
Claimants have relied. The Claimants have instructed LECG/Horwath to
respond to the PRA Report. A copy of this response dated 12 September
2007 (“LECG/Horwath 2”) is annexed at Annex 2. In sum,
LECG/Horwath have maintained their original valuations and the
methodology they adopted to make their calculations, and have provided
additional support for their conclusions. Specifically, they address each of
the reasons advanced by PRA for seeking to ignore post-valuation date
data and for adopting an “assets-based” rather than an “income-based”
approach to the valuation of the Claimants’ investments. LECG/Horwath
have carefully considered the PRA Report and provided a complete
refutation of PRA’s purported arguments. They have also provided
further reasons for confirming their opinion that there is nothing in
relation to the facts of this case that make it inappropriate or unnecessary
to employ the established DCF methodology.

6. The Respondent contends that the Claimants have received sufficient

compensation for expropriation and, or in the alternative, compensation
for breach of the other rights and protections which they enjoyed under
the two BITs. To put it another way, by reference to the wording of the
BITs, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have received the market
value of the expropriated investment, disregarding any changes in value
caused by the Respondent's conduct underlying the claim. The
Respondent contends — and the Claimants accept — that for this limited
purpose there is no material difference between the different expressions
of market value in the two BITs. However, the parties are in sharp
disagreement as to whether the compensation standard stipulated for
expropriation applies also to breaches of the other obligations alleged by
the Claimants, a point to which this Reply returns in due course.

Part XIII — Page 27

10.

A considerable body of jurisprudence exists on the valuation of
investments for purposes of investment treaty arbitrations. Before turning
to the case-law and other sources of relevant law it is instructive to begin
by noting the wording of the BITs, which is of prime importance in this
regard since they reflect the intention of the drafters of the BITs. Both set
out the valuation criteria that are to be applied for the purposes of
compensation. They do so in terms that are strikingly similar. The
Argentina BIT provides that the valuation criteria “shall include current
value, declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria
appropriate to determine market value.” The France BIT provides that
the criteria to be considered “are the current value, the asset value
including the declared tax value of tangible property and any other
criteria which, in the circumstances, are appropriate to determine the fair
market value.”

These provisions set out the criteria that are to be taken into account for
the purposes of valuation. Any qualifications are set out in these
provisions, and it is inappropriate for the Respondent to add to these.
Significantly, the provisions do not preclude account being taken of
profits (whether past, present or future) in assessing value. The words
“other criteria appropriate” (Argentina BIT) and “any other criteria”
(France BIT) indicate the intention of the drafters to allow future profits
to be taken into account where established international practice and
relevant authorities so direct.

All the parties to these proceedings agree that the Claimants are entitled
to the market value of their lost investment. They also agree that the
founding principles for compensation were laid down in the Chorzéw
Factory case. The international standard regarding compensation has
been set out by the Claimants in their Memorial on Quantum at
paragraphs 22 to 70. As recently confirmed by the tribunal in Vivendi:

“There can be no doubt about the vitality of [the Chorz6w
Factory] statement of the damages standard under customary
international law, which has been affirmed and applied by
numerous international tribunals as well as the PCLJ’s successor,
the International Court Justice. It is also clear that such a
standard permits, if the facts so require, a higher rate of recovery
than prescribed in [the BIT] for lawful expropriations.”

It is only the application of these principles to the facts of this particular
case that is in controversy. The Claimants’ case is that full compensation
includes lost profits. In Chorzow Factory, the PCIJ specifically instructed
its valuation expert “to determine the monetary value, both of the object
which should have been restored in kind and of the additional damage, on
the basis of the estimated value of the undertaking including stock as at
the moment of taking possession by the Polish Government, together with

Part XIII — Page 28

any probable profit that would have accrued to the undertaking between
the date of taking possession and that of the expert opinion.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-41 The Claimants therefore reject the Respondent’s reliance upon the ‘Asset’ or ‘Cost’
approaches and the ‘Declared Tax Value’ approach primarily because, in their
submission, they “fail to value Renave’s most precious asset, its licence to operate the

Registry” (Quan. Rep. at 18-19):

“45. LECG/Horwath conclude that none of the asset/tax figures found in the
PRA Report are to be treated as “valuations,” and reports that they are
neither useful nor appropriate because:

(i) The asset/tax figures are improperly presented by the PRA Report
as valuation results. They are based on the erroneous assumption
that the value of Renave’s business can be measured on the basis
of the book value of the assets as set out in Renave’s account
balances. Renave was undoubtedly a going concern as at 20
August 2000. Such value as it would have to its shareholders and
any potential buyers would inevitably be determined by reference
to its capacity to generate income. Its business value can only be
measured in a useful way by reference to a methodology that takes
into account its income, actual and future. On this basis the market
value has to be assessed by using the DCF income approach.

(ii) The asset/tax figures are only numerical data points drawn from
the balance sheet and the tax filings of Renave and do not amount
to, and cannot be presented as, figures that may be said to
constitute a “value.” They were not obtained by carrying out the
due diligence exercise necessary to conduct an asset based
valuation. Moreover the asset and tax figures are not capable of
being two independent sums for the purposes of any valuation
exercise as the underlying source for each is the same: Renave’s
asset account balances.

(iii) These figures do not — and cannot — reflect the market value of
Renave because the majority of the value of Renave’s business
came not from tangible assets but from intangible assets, including
most significantly the value of the Concession rights. Renave’s
business was based on the operation of the Registry during the
terms of the renewable ten-year Concession. The key tangible
assets, including the Registry’s database, were owned by the
Respondent. For this reason the PRA Report ignores the central

Part XIII — Page 29

issue, since it fails to take any account of the most valuable part of
Renave’s assets.

(iv) Further, the asset/tax figures proposed by PRA fail to take any
account of the fair market value of liabilities as would be required
in a proper asset based valuation under generally accepted
valuation principles. The PRA figures also fail to adjust the book
value of the individual assets to fair market value (or to make
adjustments to account for the valuation data being different from
the date of the source data PRA use), and for this reason alone are
meaningless.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-42 In its 12 September 2007 report, LECG/Horwath offered the following criticisms of
PRA’s proposed alternatives approaches to valuation in support of the Claimants’

Quantum Reply (LECG Second Quantum Report at 6-9):

“\.. The asset and tax figures cited in the PRA Report are based on book
values only and are not instructive

 

5. The first two figures under the terms “Asset or Cost Approach” and
“Declared Tax Value” are erroneous for several reasons. First, both
figures are improperly presented as valuation results. Both are based on
the same flawed assumption that the value of Renave’s business can be
meaningfully measured based on only the book value of assets as reflected
in Renave’s account balances. In our opinion, these figures are not useful
or indicative of the value of Renave’s operating business. As a going
concern on the valuation date of August 20, 2000, Renave’s business value
can only be meaningfully measured under an income approach. Renave’s
owners did not seek asset value in the concession but rather the income
generating capacity of the business. As a going concern, the market value
of the investment was largely dependent on the investment’s ability to
generate returns to its owners. Value would be dependent almost
exclusively on income in the case of the Renave’s concession. As of the
valuation date, Renave had functioned as a going concern for a sufficient
period to enable us properly to evaluate certain aspects of its future
performance in terms of earnings and expenditure. In our view, as
explained below, the most appropriate approach to use to value the
Claimants’ shares in Renave as a going concern is the Discounted Cash
Flow income approach (“DCF Method”).

6. It is conceptually incorrect to automatically conclude that the value of
Renave’s business is equal to its accounting/tax book value without the
use of generally accepted valuation procedures and rigorous financial
analysis to support this conclusion. These affirmative opinions regarding

Part XIII — Page 30

10.

dl.

value contained in the PRA Report under the terms “Asset or Cost
Approach” or “Declared Tax Value” are only readings of book balances
of Renave and fail to provide a fair measure of value. Neither of the two
figures are appropriate or useful in establishing an objective value for the
shares of Renave as of August 20, 2000 as a going concern. They are
merely numerical data points from the balance sheet and tax filings of
Renave and they do not rise to the level of valuation analysis. The figures
should also not be misinterpreted as representing two independent
valuation data points as their source is the same (Renave’s asset account
balances).

Asset account balances are comprised of historical acquisition costs with
reductions as appropriate for depreciation based on assumed conventions.
Assets include cash, receivables, fixed assets, and capitalized costs. A
value obtained from reading of a book or tax balance sheet is hardly
indicative of the fair value of Renave’s shares as a going concern and
would be more indicative of a liquidation value or floor value under
distress.

The majority of the value of Renave’s business did not come from its
tangible assets but rather from intangibles including the value of the
concession rights. The PRA Report does not value the intangibles and
ignores the core values of the business represented by its rights under the
Concession and the profit to be derived from future revenues.

Renave’s business was based on operating the Registry during the term/s
of the concession. Key assets including the Registry’s database were
owned by Mexico. The value of Renave was not in the assets or in
appreciation or depreciation thereof, but rather, in the income stream
generated during the concession.

The calculation presented under the term “Expected Returns Approach”
is not relevant to valuation analysis:

The PRA Report asserts a third affirmative opinion of value under the
hearing “Expected Returns Approach”. This is an irrelevant calculation.
Although the term “expected returns” is commonly used in finance and
economics, there is no such “approach” in valuation theory and this is not
a generally accepted valuation method. The calculation is based on the
future value, as of August 20, 2000, of four cash contributions made by
each of the Claimants into Renave’s capital account on September 1999,
December 1999, February 2000, and July 2000, using a future value
interest factor based on a rate of 26% - 31%. It is conceptually incorrect
to assume that the value of Renave’s business can be measured based on
the sum of certain equity contributions made by its shareholders plus some
rate of return. In our view, this calculation is not instructive in valuing
Renave’s assets.

Part XIII — Page 31

12.

13.

The logic of this calculation is flawed and the results provide no useful
information in valuing Renave’s shares as a going concern. The PRA
Report provides no financial analysis or explanation as to how the cash
contributions made by the Claimant’s are the determinants of business
value. The actual market value of an investment over time is not typically
determined by the level of cash (or debt assumed) by an investor.

The PRA Report comparisons are not instructive:

The comparisons using the aforementioned asset, tax and contribution
figures presented in the PRA are not valid. This would include comparing
these figures to each other or to results obtained under valid valuation
approaches. Since the asset and tax figures are from the same source, they
offer no corroboration value. Also given that the “expected return”
calculation is not related to a legitimate valuation concept and the results
are irrelevant and arbitrary under this perspective, comparing this figure
to the asset and tax figures offers no corroboration value either. We also
note that the PRA Report subjectively compares these figures to a
substantially deflated modification of our valuation results after certain
erroneous adjustments. This arbitrary comparison also offers no
legitimate corroboration. In our opinion, the following conclusions in the
PRA Report should not be relied upon:

“As can be quickly recognized, the values obtained by the Asset or
Cost Approach are significantly lower than the value concluded by
the LECG Report, but they are very much in line with the values
yielded by the revised LECG Report's model and methodology
when the revised assumptions are used.”

“Again, the values obtained by the Declared Tax Value approach
are significantly lower than the value concluded by the LECG
Report, and are more in line with the values yielded by the revised
LECG Report’s model and methodology when the revised
assumptions are used.”

“In contrast, the values we obtained from the expected returns
approach are very much in line with the values yielded by the
revised LECG Report's model and methodology when the revised
assumptions are used, as discussed in the previous sections.”

We also do not recognise the usefulness of the PRA Report's commentary
that the value estimated in our report differs substantially by various
multiples from actual capital contributions made by the shareholders of
Renave and from the book value of Renave. This is not uncommon.
Business values commonly exceed these measures.”

Part XIII — Page 32

13-43. Although the Claimants presented several alternative quantum calculations in their

Quantum Reply, these too were based on the DCF method (Quan. Rep. at 41-42):

“94. The first [...] is a valuation based upon the projections in the Business
Plan. This calculates the market value of the Claimants’ shares only as
MXN$501,180,000. The value attributable to the Talsud shareholdings of
29% of the shares is MXN$145,342,200 and the value attributable to the
Gemplus shareholding of 20% of the shares is MXN$100,236,050.

95. The second alternative is the calculation of the Claimants’ lost profit
damages as of 20 August 2000 (as distinct from a calculation of the
market value of the shares in Renave held by the Claimants). This
calculation, which is made for both new and used vehicles together and
for new vehicles alone, produces results which are the same as the
original calculation of the market values of the shares.

96. The third alternative [...] is a valuation of the shares as of 12 December
2002 on the basis that the business of Renave was limited to the
registration of new vehicles. The intention here is to provide a value based
upon the actual experience of Renave which continued to register new
vehicles up to about 12 December 2002 when the Concession was
revoked.

97. On the basis of this last alternative, the market value of the shares in
Renave in respect of Talsud is given as MXN$149,405,100 and for
Gemplus is given as MXN$103,038,000. A valuation is also provided for
the terminal value of the Concession as of 12 December 2002 in order to
quantify the value of a subsequent renewal, again as limited to new
vehicles.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-44 In their closing submissions during the main hearing, the Claimants maintained that the

alternative approaches proposed by the Respondent should be rejected (D8: 1776-1777):

“A quick word about the alternative approaches espoused by the
Respondent's expert, PRA. There were three. The first is the asset cost
approach; second is the tax return approach; third is the expected returns
[one]. Well, the first and the second should be rejected. Mr. Rién admits
that they do not allow - they would not allow you to take into account the
projected revenues, and that’s at page 1533, line 10.

And the third of the alternative [sic], the expected returns approach,
should also be rejected because there is no such approach in valuation
theory on the evidence - on our evidence, I should say - and no reasons
why cash contributions - cash contributions alone are determinants of

Part XIII — Page 33

business value have been put forward. In that respect, I refer you to the
second report of LECG.”

13-45 Finally, in their post-hearing submissions, the Claimants’ similarly maintained their
primary approach to valuation, i.e. the DCF method, criticising as follows the

Respondent’s proposed alternative methods (Claimants’ Post-Hearing Br. at 13-14):

“53. The Claimants explained why the DCF method is applicable in their
closing submissions (D8.1773,19-1776,20) and make further reference to
Sempra (above at para 50). The reasons why the alternative asset cost
approach, tax return approach and expected returns approach are
inapplicable were also addressed (D8.1776,21-177,14). Of particular
importance in this context is the track record of new car registrations.

54. On that point, it was submitted by Counsel for the Respondent that it
cannot be assumed that the Registry would have survived but for the
intervention of the State, and that had it not been for the intervention, the
Registry “would have died on its feet” (D8.1921,11). It was also a
constant refrain of the evidence of Mr Rion given in cross-examination
that the performance of the Registry following the intervention is not a
guide to loss of profit because the project was no longer autonomous (see
e.g. D7.1531,4-15 and D7.582,20 to 1529, 1-3).

55. These arguments were not supported by any evidence. They are
unsubstantiated assertions in respect of which the comments of Mr Rién
add nothing. He was not informed about operational matters and it was
not his purpose or function or expertise to explore these (D7.1561, 8-9).

56. It is a striking feature of this argument that it was not even pleaded in the
memorial on liability, and that it only emerged for the first time in the
Respondent's counter memorial on damages (paragraph 7) (and was
further el d in the Rejoinder on de (f 46, 55, 57
and 93)). It was not addressed in any of the statements of the Respondent’ 's
factual witnesses, and was notably absent from the statement of Mrs.
Gomez-Mont. Nor was the argument put to the Claimants’ witnesses
during the hearing. No analysis of the record of new car registrations was
conducted by PRA and the fact that the Registry continued to operate for
new vehicles until the Revocation of the Concession was entirely ignored
in the Respondent’s pleadings on liability.

 

57. It is not now open to the Respondent — at this late stage in the proceedings
— to advance a case based on an entirely untested and unsupported factual
assertion, namely that the Registry would have collapsed had the
intervention not occurred, and that the registration record should be
ignored as somehow artificial or unrepresentative for the purposes of
assessing damages. Not only is this unsupported by evidence, but it

method and proposes three alternative valuation methods: (1) the ‘Asset or Cost

Approach’; (2) the ‘Declared Tax Value Approach’; and (3) the ‘Expected Returns

contradicts the evidence of two of the Respondent’s witnesses who
acknowledged that the process for registering new cars was almost
automatic (see Mr Gallardo at D7.1432-1433 and Mr Gonzdlez at
D6.1366, 22-1367, 17) and backed up by a clear legal obligation of
manufacturers and dealers to provide the necessary information to the
Concessionaire (Mr Gallardo at D7.1423, 6-15 and D7.1430, 6-9 re new
vehicles and D7.1427, 3-22 re used vehicles). The argument also flies in
the face of the uncontroverted fact that during the thirty-two months of the
operations of the Registry nearly all (between 97% and 99%) of all new
vehicles on the roads of Mexico were registered by Renave.”

The Respondent’s Case

Approach’.

In its Counter-Memorial on Quantum, the Respondent made the following submissions

on these alternative methods (Quan. CM at 4-5):

“14.

15.

16.

17.

The Claimants’ experts [LECG/Horwath] discard the market value
method because in the instant case the asset was not publicly traded and
there was no open market for it.

Mexico agrees with this view.

The Claimants’ experts also summarily dismiss the asset or cost method.
The memorial notes that:

LECG/Horwath excluded the Asset Approach as it would not take
into account the full earning potential of Renave and would
therefore not reflect accurately the price that a willing buyer and a
willing seller would have agreed.

Mexico does not agree with this.

Part XIII — Page 35

18. The asset approach is: (i) a recognized method of valuation under both
treaties; (ii) is the preferred approach in international law; and (iii)
according to the arbitral authorities, when a tribunal is concerned with a
start-up company in its early stages of operation.

19. The Claimants’ experts say nothing about the declared tax value of
Renave’s tangible assets. In response to Mexico’s request for disclosure of
documents pertaining to quantum, the Claimants initially asserted that
Renave’s tax returns “have no specific relevance to the valuation of the
Concession and are therefore immaterial to the outcome of the quantum
proceedings.”

20. Mexico does not agree with this assertion either. It is plainly in error.

21. The declared tax value of the investment’s tangible assets is a valuation
criterion stipulated by both treaties and thus the tax returns are plainly
relevant. After Mexico objected to the Claimants’ refusal to produce such
documents, the Claimants reversed their position and agreed to provide
the company’s tax returns for the years 1999-2002 inclusive.

22. Mexico says that the declared tax value criterion should also be applied
by the Tribunal. Said criterion is contemplated by both treaties and the
arbitral authorities consider it to be useful method for valuing start-up
companies such as Renave.

23. Both the asset value and the declared value methods should be preferred
over the DCF method, which is both wholly speculative and
impermissible, due to Renave’s absence of a proven track record of
profitable operations at the date valuation. On settled public international
law jurisprudence repeatedly reaffirmed in the investor-State arbitration
context, the DCF method cannot be employed on the facts of this case.

24, Even if a DCF valuation could be employed (which is denied), once again,
on settled principle, it must be checked against the asset or cost method
and the declared tax value of tangible assets criterion; the three methods
of valuation are not mutually exclusive of each other and differences
between the results must be explicable.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-48 Asset Value Approach: With regard to the ‘Asset Value Approach’, the Respondent
submits the following (Quan. CM at 27-28):

“104. PRA considers it appropriate to use the Asset or Cost Approach (which is
expressly contemplated in both treaties) because it eliminates much of the
speculative aspects of the valuation, which are directly related to different
views or expectations about the future prospects of Renave. In this sense,

Part XIII — Page 36

the Asset or Cost Approach is a “neutral approach that takes into
consideration only objective information as of the date of valuation
(namely the actual value, or cost of the assets) and is not subject to
subjective interpretations about what the future of a company might look
like.”

105. Based on the unaudited financial states as of 31 July 2000, Talsud’s and
Gemplus’s stake in the net asset value of Renave on the aforementioned
date was $19,355,642 pesos and 13,348,718 pesos respectively.

106. PRA also calculated the declared tax value of tangible assets as per
Renave’s tax returns for 1999 and 2000 (i.e., since there are no monthly
tax returns). According to this approach, Talsud’s equity participation
would range between $11.26 and $41.46 million pesos and Gemplus’s
equity between $7.76 and $28.59 million pesos.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-49 PRA further explains its reliance on the ‘Asset Value Approach’ as follows, in response

to LECG/Horwath’s expert opinions to the contrary (First PRA Report at 37-38):

“162. The LECG Report considers that the Market or Comparable Approach is
not useful in the case of Renave, as there are no similar or comparable
businesses to Renave, and whose can be used to infer the value of Renave.
We agree with the LECG Report on this view.

[ou]

164. The third option, the Asset or Cost Approach, is dismissed by the LECG
Report because it is “not reflective of the full earning power and cash-
generated power of Renave’s total business enterprise”. Although this is
true, the Asset or Cost Approach is a neutral approach that takes into
consideration only objective information as of the date of valuation
(namely the actual value, or cost, of the assets), and is not subject to the
subjective interpretations about what the future of a company might look
like.

165. In the case of Renave, this becomes very relevant, because as can be seen
from the analysis presented in the LECG Report, and the analysis
contained herein, there can be very substantial differences in views about
the future prospects of a business, especially when there is little track
record to support future projections. While the LECG Report projects a
strong, growing and stable business, our view is that given the internal
operational and external conditions that prevailed around the Valuation
Date, such a strong and stable growth was unlikely.

Part XIII — Page 37

166.

167.

168.

169.

Furthermore, the Asset of [sic] Cost Approach is a recognized method of
valuation under many bilateral treaties, including the Mexico-Argentina
treaty and the Mexico-France treaty (as confirmed to us by legal counsel
to Mexico). As such, it is necessary to at least perform a valuation under
this approach, and have its result serve as an additional reference of
value.

As of July 31, 2000, according to the internal financial statements of
Renave which were presented to the Board of Directors, the total value of
the assets of Renave was $66,743,592 pesos.

Since there are no financial statements available as of the Valuation Date,
the only verifiable financial statements available as of such date would
have been the July 31, 2000 ones.

Considering the Claimants’ equity stake in Renave, 29% of the net asset
value of Renave would have corresponded to Talsud, and 20% would have
corresponded to Gemplus, or about $19.4 million pesos and $13.3 million
pesos, respectively.

170.

As can be quickly recognized, the values obtained by the Asset or Cost
Approach are significantly lower than the value concluded by the LECG
Report, but they are very much in line with the values yielded by the
revised LECG Report’s model and methodology when the revised
assumptions are used.”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Respondent reiterated its position as regards the merits of its approach, on the basis

of PRA’s analysis, in its Quantum Rejoinder (Quan. Rej. at para. 88):

“88.

As for the use of the Asset Approach to determine de [sic] value of the
Claimants’ shares, PRA explains that it is a valid approach when, as in
this case, there is a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the prospects
of a company/project or when cash flows cannot be reasonably forecasted
due to the lack of a track record of profitable operations. As for the date of
valuation, Renave had just begun operations, had internal operational
difficulties, was not profitable, could not produce reliable financial
information, and the project was already facing significant opposition.
Under these circumstances, in PRA’s opinion, the Asset Approach should
be preferred over a DCF analysis. At the very least, it should be used to
test the reasonableness of the results under such approach. (And when
that is done, the DCF valuation is seen as greatly inflated.)”

[Footnotes omitted]

Part XIII — Page 39

13-51 In its second expert report, PRA expressed the following opinion with regard to LECG’s
criticism that this approach does not take into account future cash flows (Second PRA

Report at 8-9):

“21. LECG is correct in stating that this approach does not take into account
future cash flows, and its criticism would be valid if there were no doubts
regarding Renave’s future profitability and its continuity as a going
concern during the term of the Concession. We do not believe these
conditions are present.

22. The Asset or Cost Approach is an appropriate methodology when there is
a lot of uncertainty regarding the viability of a company. We believe that,
as of the Valuation Date, and based on the information available at that
time, it would have been very difficult to determine whether Renave would
be profitable in the future and opine with any certainty on its prospects as
a going concern given its short existence, its internal problems and the
significant potential and social opposition the project was facing.

23. As of 20 August 2000, Renave had been operating on a nationwide basis
for approximately 2 months, it had never generated any profits and had
accumulated losses of approximately $44 million pesos (since January
2000), as demonstrated by the August 2000 financial statements, which
were reviewed by Renave’s Board of Directors.

24, As for the Valuation Date, Renave’s managers were unable to reconcile
bank revenues with its operation, that is, they could not match the deposits
it received with the vehicles that had been registered. In fact, in its
presentation to the Board of Directors on 27 June 2000, Renave’s
management reported that only $1,223,869 pesos from its $20, 129, 106
pesos back account balance had been identified, which corresponded to
“stationary and kits”. The origin of the remaining $18,905,252 pesos, that
is 94% of the bank account's balance, was unknown.

25. Even more concerning was the fact that Renave’s accounting division
recorded revenues from registrations (from both used [and] new vehicles)
for an amount of $7,977,149 pesos, although it ignored whether those
transactions were actually paid.

“we have an accounting record of the client, number and type of
operation from new car registrations for $7,048,222 and used car

registrations for $927,927; we do not know if these transactions

have been paid or the date of payment (if it is the case)”

[Emphasis added]

Part XIII — Page 40

26. LECG considers these matters to be insignificant and as normal business
situations. We do not consider them normal much less insignificant, and
believe that a hypothetical purchaser on the Date of Valuation would
share this view. We believe it is fundamental that a company be able to
determine whether or not it has been paid for the services it has provided
and explain where its revenues come from. But Renave could not do so, at
least not as of the Valuation Date.

27. It we take into account all these factors, it becomes clear that there was no
certainty whatsoever about Renave’s profitability (Renave was not
profitable up to that moment), its financial and operational record was no
longer enough to project future cash flows with a minimum degree of
reliability and, given the clear opposition to the project and the evident
financial and operational disorder, there was at least a reasonable doubt
about its viability as a going concern. That, in our opinion, justifies a
valuation under the asset approach.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-52 In respect of LECG’s criticism that the Asset Approach fails to capture the value of the
Concessionaire’s most important asset (the Concession Agreement), PRA replied as

follows (Second PRA Report at 10-11):

“30. The LECG Reply argues that most of Renave’s value did not come from its
tangible assets but from its Title of Concession, which is an intangible
asset. If the concession was a low-risk business, as LECG assumes, and
was low-risk because its revenues were somehow guaranteed by the
obligation to register vehicles, we would expect the price paid for the
concession rights to have some relationship with its value. For that
reason, we thought it would be illustrative to compare what the
Concessionaire would have had to pay for those rights to the value that
LECG now ascribes to them.

31. According to the Title of Concession, Renave had to make an initial
payment of $11.3 million pesos upon receiving the Title of Concession, an
additional payment of $9 million pesos (adjusted for inflation) 12 months
hence, and make subsequent annual payments of $8 million pesos (also
adjusted for inflation) during the remaining term.

32. In order to facilitate the comparison, we have calculated the present value
as of 20 August 2000 of the payments the concessionaire would have had
to make using the 15% discount rate that LECG uses in its report. The
result is a total amount of $58.2 million pesos. This would be the price
that Renave would have had to pay for the intangible from which,
according to LECG, the concessionaire derived most of its value.

34,

Naturally, Renave expected a return on this investment, that is, it expected
to obtain profits in excess of the price it paid for the rights to exploit the
concession. However, what LECG suggests would be equivalent to
assuming that Renave’s shareholders acquired rights with a value close to
$754.7 million pesos in just $58.2 million pesos, which would imply a
92.3% discount over their “real” value.

It goes without saying that this kind of discount is only observed in real
life when there is a high degree of risk associated with the project. A
discount of this magnitude in a low risk project would be equivalent to a
wealth transfer from the government to a private company, not a market
transaction. LECG assumes low risk for the project in one hand, and a
great discount in the intangible’s value on the other, which translates into
avery high return for the shareholders (1,197% on their investment).

35, To be clear, we are not submitting this exercise as an alternative valuation
criteria but only as a reference point to test the reasonableness of LECG’s
conclusion on value.”

[Footnotes omitted]

Declared Tax Value Approach: As an alternative to the Asset Approach, the
Respondent submits that the Tribunal should apply the Declared Tax Value Approach.
On the basis of the Concessionaire’s 1999 and 2000 tax returns and measured as of 20
August 2000, the Respondent estimates that the value of Talsud’s equity participation
would range between MXN 11.26 and 41.46 million and the value of Gemplus’ equity
participation would range from MXN 7.76 to 28.59 million (Quan. CM, para. 106 at
28).

With regard to the ‘Declared Tax Value Approach’, PRA expresses the following
opinion (First PRA Report at 38-39):

“171. Although not mentioned in the LECG Report, the Declared Tax Value of
Tangible Assets Approach is also a recognized method of valuation under
the Mexico-Argentina treaty and the Mexico-France treaty (as confirmed
to us by legal counsel to Mexico).

172. In its annual tax return for the year 1999, Renave declared a total asset
value of $38,845,434, and in its annual tax return for the year 2000,
Renave declared a total asset value of $142,976,895.

173. As no monthly tax returns of Renave are available for the year 2000, as of
the Valuation Date, the only available income tax return would have been
the 1999 annual income tax return.

174. Considering the Claimants’ equity stake in Renave, 29% of the declared
total asset value of Renave, as declared in the 1999 and 2000 annual
income tax returns, would have corresponded to Talsud, and 20% would
have corresponded to Gemplus, or between $11.3 million pesos and $41.5
pesos for Talsud, and between $7.8 million pesos and $28.6 million pesos
for Gemplus.

175. Again, the values obtained by the Declared Tax Value approach
are significantly lower than the value concluded by the LECG
report, and are more in line with the values yielded by the revised
LECG Report’s model and methodology when the revised
assumptions are used.”

13-55 Expected Returns Approach: In the further alternative, the Respondent submits that

recourse should be had to the ‘Expected Returns Approach’ (Quan. CM at 28):

“107. PRA also applied the Expected Returns Approach. Under this approach,
the value of the Claimants’ shares in Renave are determined by applying
an appropriate rate of return to the Claimants’ capital contributions.

108. PRA estimates that given the risk associated with the project, the investors
would have sought a rate of return between 26 and 31%. By applying
these rates to the capital contributions made by the shareholders as of 20
August 2000, PRA concludes that the value of Talsud’s shares would lie
between $20.0 and $20.6 million pesos and the value of Gemplus’s shares
would be between $13.8 and $14.24 million pesos.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-56 PRA explains the basis for this approach as follows (First PRA Report at 39-42):
“176. Although not explicitly recognized by either the Mexico-Argentina treaty,
nor the Mexico-France treaty (as a note, neither is the DCF

methodology), we consider that a third alternative to establish the

Part XIII — Page 44

minimum value that the Claimants could have hoped their investment in
Renave to be worth, as of the Valuation Date, is the expected returns
approach.

177. Under this approach, the general concept is to calculate what the value of
the Claimants’ shares in Renave should have been, as of the Valuation
Date, so that the Claimants would have realized an adequate and expected
return on their investments, had they sold their shares as of the Valuation
Date.

178. To start with this analysis, we first need to establish a proper discount
rate at which the capital investments made by the Claimants in Renave are
to be discounted to bring to present value as of the Valuation Date.

179. The LECG Report considered a 15% discount rate as appropriate. We,
however, considered that this discount rate was not suitable as it did not
properly reflect the expected returns an equity investor in Renave might
have, given the contemporaneous available investment alternatives and
the risk profile of Renave, and considered that a discount rate of between
26% and 31% was more appropriate (note that by choosing a higher
discount rate than the LECG Report, we will arrive at a higher present
value, thus we are being more optimistic).

180. The next step is to calculate the present value, as of the Valuation Date, or
August 20, 2000, of the actual capital investments made by the Claimants
in Renave on or before the Valuation Date. As can be seen, at present
value, Talsud’s investment was worth between $20.0 million pesos and
$20.6 million pesos, while Gemplus’ investment was worth between $13.8
million pesos and $14.2 million pesos.

181. For perspective, using the LECG Report’s 15% discount rate, the present
value of the Claimants’ investment would have been lower, at $18.7
million pesos for Talsud, and $12.9 million for Gemplus.

182. This means that, if Talsud and Gemplus had received $20.6 million pesos,
and $14.2 million pesos, respectively, on the Valuation Date, they would
have earned a 31% return on their invested capital, which is a very
reasonable return, and certainly a higher return than 15% return that the
LECG Report considered as adequate.

183. When comparing these values against the values of $218.9 million pesos
for Talsud and $150.9 million pesos for Gemplus that were concluded by
the LECG Report, it becomes evident that the LECG Report's values are
significantly overstated.

184. If, on the Valuation Date, Talsud and Gemplus would have actually

received the amounts calculated by the LECG Report in exchange for their

191.

shares in Renave, the Claimants would have earned an annualized return
of more than 1932% on their investment. This would have been quite a
remarkable feat, considering the Claimants had only owned shares of
Renave for less than I year. Needless to say, such returns are extremely
rare, if non non-existant, in the real world.

In contrast, the values we obtain from the expected returns approach are
very much in line with the values yielded by the revised LECG Report's
model and methodology when revised assumptions are used, as discussed
in the previous sections.

It is important to mention that this methodology does not take into account
the potential earning beyond the Valuation Date that the shareholders in
Renave could have hoped for. However, as in the case of the Asset or Cost
approach, it is a neutral approach that is not subject to the subjective
interpretations about what the future of Renave might have looked like,
which, as we have seen, can vary substantially.

This methodology simply calculates what the value of the shares of Renave
should have been, as of the Valuation Date, in order for its shareholders
to have received a reasonable return on their invested capital up to that
point in time. The methodology does not speculate about the possible
future performance of Renave.

Furthermore, it is feasible that the shareholders of Renave, given the
opposition they faced around the Valuation Date, would have been
motivated to sell their shares (thus eliminating all of their potential risk in
their invested capital), and receiving a reasonable return of between 26%
and 31% on their capital investments. In less than one year, Talsud, for
example, would have earned about $3.9 million pesos on a_ total
investment of $16.8 million pesos. In the context of LECG Report's
definition of market value, these conditions would have very likely created
a “willing seller”.

Now, having calculated the present value of the Claimants’ capital
investments in Renave, it is only proper to discount from these amounts
the present value of the cash distributions that were actually received by
the Claimants from their investment in Renave. These returns were
previously calculated in section B.6 (Table 6).

At present value, as of the Valuation Date, the actual cash distributions
received by the Claimants were of $18.0 million pesos for Talsud, and
$12.1 million pesos for Gemplus.

Deducting these actual cash distributions the Claimants received from

Renave, from the present value of the Claimants’ investments in Renave,
the result is that, as of the Valuation Date, Talsud would just have

Part XIII — Page 47

required between $2.1 million pesos and $2.7 million pesos of additional
money to achieve its expected returns, and Gemplus would just have
required between $1.7 million and $2.1 million pesos of additional money
to achieve its expected returns (expected returns of between 26% and 31%
per annum).

192. Following the LECG report’s methodology of deducting both the present
value of the distributions received by the Claimants and also the current
value of the shares Renave, we obtain a final number of between $1.4
million pesos and $2.0 million pesos for Talsud, and of between $1.2
million pesos and $1.6 million pesos for Gemplus.

13-57 The Respondent relies upon PRA’s second report to expand on the appropriateness of

this approach (Quan. Rej. at para. 89):

“89. With regard to the Expected Returns Approach, PRA points out that,
although it is not a conventional valuation exercise, it does offer another
yardstick against which the Claimants’ damages claim can be tested. This
approach is used to calculate the price at which the shares in Renave
would have had to be sold on 20 August 2000 in order to ensure that the
investors received their investment back plus a reasonable return
(between 26% and 31% in only 9 months). That reasonable return stands
in stark contrast to the 1,932% return implicit in LECG/Horwath’s
estimate of the fair market value of the shares and is inconsistent with the
return associated with a low risk investment (which LECG/Horwath
claims Renave was).”

13-58 PRA responded to LECG’s criticisms on its Expected Returns Approach (Second PRA
Report at 14-16):

“S51. In the PRA Report, we presented an alternate approach that could serve
as an additional reference point to establish the reasonable range for the
“fair market value” of Renave’s shares as of 20 August 2000.

52. To_be clear, we confirm that the purpose of this calculation is not to
determine _Renave’s value from __the contributions _made__ by _ its
shareholders. What we want_to_ascertain_is_the_amount_that_the
shareholders needed to receive for their shares on the Date of Val
in order to obtain a reasonable market return.

 

53. LECG considers this calculation irrelevant because it is not a generally
accepted valuation methodology. Although we agree that the approach
presented in the PRA Report is not a methodology typically used in the
business valuation discipline (and nowhere in the PRA Report we say it
is), it does offer a reference point that allows us to test the calculations
presented in the LECG report.

54. Ibbotson Associates, one of the information sources used by LECG to
calculate its discount rate, explains that the discount rate used to
determine the present value of future cash flows is equivalent to the rate of
return that the investors expect to obtain from its investment.

The cost of capital (sometimes called the expected or required rate
of return or the discount rate) can be viewed from three different
perspectives. On the asset side of a firm’s balance sheet, it is the
rate that should be used to discount to a present value the future
expected cash flows. On the liability side, it is the economic cost to

13-60

55.

56.

57.

the firm of attracting and retaining capital in a competitive
environment, in which investors (capital providers) carefully
analyze and compare all return generating opportunities. On the
investor's side, it is the return one expects and requires from_an
investment_in_a_firm’s debt _or equity. While _each_of these
erspectives might view the cost of capital differently, they are all

dealing with the same number.” [Emphasis added]

    

According to the values suggested by LECG, if Renave’s shareholders
had chosen to sell their shares on the Date of Valuation they would have
obtained an annualized return of more than 1,932% on their investment in
a company with only two months of operations, in a period of less than
nine months. In our opinion, this scenario is simply not realistic, specially
considering that LECG itself believes that the appropriate discount rate
for Renave’s cash flows (which is equivalent to the return expected by
Renave investors, as Ibbotson Associates points out) should be only 15%.

The LECG Reply criticizes our approach by arguing that this is not a
generally recognized methodology, but at no time does it offer an
explanation as to why the 1,932% return for Renave shareholders is more
appropriate than a market return of between 26% and 31% as we
suggested in the PRA Report; specially if we take into account that LECG
considers Renave to be a low-risk company.

We believe that notwithstanding LECG’s attempt to discredit this
approach simply because it is not an orthodox valuation methodology, it
is a helpful tool to evaluate the reasonableness of the valuations
presented in the LECG report, specially in view of the very few valuation
alternatives available in this case due to the scarcity and low quality of
the available information.”

[Footnotes omitted: emphasis in original.]

PRA concludes, on the basis of varying values obtained through different valuation
methodologies, that a realistic range of the Concessionaire’s value as of 20 August 2000
is between MXN 12.6 million and MXN 71.2 million; or, even if using LECG/Horwath
DCF method (as adjusted by PRA), to no more than MXN 137.9 million. Applying
Talsud’s and Gemplus’ respective percentage shareholdings in the Concessionaire, PRA

estimate a valuation between MXN zero to MXN 21,325,213 for Talsud and between

MXN zero and MXN 14,959,438 for Gemplus.

In its conclusions at the main hearing, Counsel for the Respondent submitted with

regard to its proposed alternative quantum approaches, as follows (D8:1923-1924):

Part XIII — Page 50

“I’m told that I’m about to run out of time, so I’m going to say two things
quickly. We have postulated three alternatives. One is the your money
back equals fair market value alternative, which was the choice in both
Metalclad and in the Tecmed case and in a number of other cases which
we have cited in our pleadings as an alternative to fair market value based
on some future profits projection where that wasn't appropriate.

We postulated a second possibility.

We postulated another alternative, which is your money back plus
reasonable rate [sic] of return. That reasonable rate of return is given in
the PRA Report in a range of 26 percent to 31 percent, which was the
discount rate used for his [sic] comparative DCF calculation.

The figures are in the report, but if you use a 26 percent rate of return,
Talsud would get an extra 2.1 million pesos, which would rise to 2,7
million pesos and 31 percent rate of return. Gemplus would get an extra
1.7 million pesos for a 26 percent rate of return, and 2.1 million pesos at a
31 percent rate of return.”

13-61 In its post-hearing submissions, the Respondent concluded its case on quantum with

these comments (Respondent’s Post-Hearing Br. at 18-20):

“36. Mexico responded to the claim for damages as presented by the Claimants
- first, on the basis that the valuation dated was 20 August 2000 (the day
before the 21 August 2000 announcement) and later on the basis that the
valuation date was 11 December 2002 (the day before the concession was
cancelled). The Claimant has not adduced evidence of the fair market
value of Renave immediately prior to 27 June 2001 (the date of the
requisition) and Mexico has not responded to such a claim.

37. Mexico’s position is that, whether the alleged date of breach is taken as
August 20, 2000, 26 June 2001 or 11 December 2002, it would be
inappropriate on the facts of this case to use a DCF valuation model to
assess damages. In August 2000, Renave was a ‘start up” that lacked a
sufficient track record of profitability as required by settled jurisprudence.
Likewise, it has no track record of profitability autonomously from the
Secretariat at any time after the Cavallo scandal. Rather, its operations
were fronted by the government at all times after the appointment of the
first administrative intervener in mid-September 2000.

38. As explained in response to Question 7, there is a serious question as to
whether Renave was ready, willing and able to independently operate a
new and used car registry (or even a new car registry alone) following the
evisceration of its credibility on 24 August 2000. Accordingly, any
projection as to what profits Renave would have earned had control of the

39.

40.

41.

concession been returned to the shareholders would be entirely
speculative.

Mexico submits that the fair market value of Renave as at any of the
proposed valuation dates should be assessed by reference to the amount
invested, as was done in Metalclad, Tecmed and Wena Hotels. As
explained in the pleadings, both Claimants were permitted to recover
substantially all that they invested by withdrawing dividends and their
variable capital equal to or exceeding their paid up capital.

Alternatively, fair market value (as well as damages for alleged breach of
the fair and equitable treatment obligation) could be assessed by allowing
the Claimants a reasonable return on the amount they invested, described
in the PRA reports as the “Expected Returns Approach”. PRA calculated
the following range of damages based on the 20 August 2000 valuation
date used by the Claimants, recorded in Table 11 of the PRA’s first report:

a) using a 26% annual rate of return, Talsud would be entitled to the
further sum of 1,360,461 pesos and Gemplus would be entitled to
1,192,648 pesos; and

b) using a 31% annual rate of return, Talsud would recover an
additional 1,974,009 pesos and Gemplus would receive 1,616,261
pesos.

These amounts would be modestly higher if a 27 June 2001 or 12
December 2002 valuation date is used as both of the Claimants had by
then made additional capital contributions (Gemplus in December 2000
and Talsud in June 2001). PRA has provided the following new
calculations using the same methodology:

(05) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

13-62

13-63

13-64

13-65

First, on the basis of the facts found by the Tribunal earlier in this Award, it is
appropriate for the Tribunal to summarise below the more significant factors relevant to

its analysis below.

The National Vehicle Registry: The national project for registering vehicles in Mexico,
both historically and as originally envisaged by the Respondent (including the
Secretariat) and the Concessionaire (including the Claimants), comprised the registration
of both used and new vehicles. It was not envisaged that such registration could be
limited permanently to new vehicles. Otherwise, the project could never achieve its
purpose as a national vehicle registry for all vehicles in Mexico. As found by the Tribunal
earlier in this Award, the Secretariat’s suspension of the obligation to register used

vehicles on 15 September 2000 was intended to be temporary, not permanent.

Profitability: The Concession was intended by the Respondent (including the Secretariat)
and the Concessionaire (including the Claimants) to be a profitable investment for the
Concessionaire. Although the project never achieved the level of profitability
contemplated in the Concessionaire’s Business Plan, it still retained a reasonable
opportunity to make significant future profits until the Respondent’s unlawful conduct on
25 June 2001, with the Requisition. The registration of new vehicles was eventually a
profitable activity for the Concessionaire. However, as already indicated above, the
registration of new vehicles only was not the project envisaged by the Concessionaire
and the Respondent; and it was also intended that receipts for registering new vehicles
would be used by the Concessionaire to off-set its higher costs of registering used
vehicles. Hence, any profitability based only upon income from registering new vehicles
is not a true measure of the Concessionaire’s profitability, as its business was originally

envisaged under the Concession Agreement.

Risks: The Concessionaire was the direct beneficiary of a state monopoly, granted by the

Secretariat in the form of the Concession Agreement, to provide a new nation-wide

Part XIII — Page 53

13-66

13-67

13-68

13-69

public service, within a federal state, to millions of Mexican citizens. It was thus always a
high risk project for the Concessionaire, subject not only to commercial factors
confronting a new business but subject also to the co-operation of Mexican states and
continuing support from Mexican public opinion. These risks were compensated by the
prospect of significant profits from the Concession. The two, high risks and significant

profits, are necessarily intertwined in this case.

No Market: The Tribunal accepts that there was no open, public, active or other available
market for the Claimants’ shares in the Concessionaire, as at the relevant date for their
valuation (24 June 2001). The Tribunal also accepts that there was no comparable
business to the Concessionaire’s Concession (as a business), at this relevant date, which

could provide any reliable guide to the market value of the Claimants’ shares.

Capital: As at the valuation date (24 June 2001), the value of the Claimants’ shares in the
Concessionaire was not materially affected by the relatively low level of contributions
towards capital and related expenditure made by the Concessionaire’s shareholders
(including the Claimants). There was to be, inevitably, a significant disparity between the
shareholders’ contributions and the Concessionaire’s profits, given the high degree of risk

associated with the Concession and the correlative prospect of significant profitability.

Intangible Asset: As at the valuation date (24 June 2001), the value of the Claimants’
shares in the Concessionaire was not materially affected by the Concessionaire’s assets or
declared tax values but derived, indirectly, from its income stream reasonably anticipated
from the Concession Agreement, as an intangible asset. (The Tribunal considers

separately below the level of such anticipation and its associated uncertainties).

No Complete Business: The Concession was operative, as regards the registration of new
and used vehicles under the Concession Agreement, for no more than five weeks in July-
August 2000. After a period of uncertainty, the Concessionaire was limited to the
registration of new vehicles on 15 September 2000, albeit with the possibility of being
restored to full-life with the renewed registration of used vehicles. Effectively, the
Concessionaire’s business survived thereafter in a form of suspended half-life from 15

September 2000 to 24 June 2001, limited to the registration of new vehicles. That half-

Part XIII — Page 54

13-70

13-71

13-72

13-73

life was not the business concern originally envisaged by the Respondent (including the
Secretariat) and the Concessionaire (including the Claimants) under the Concession

Agreement.

‘No Going Concern’: As at the relevant date for valuation (24 June 2001), the
Concessionaire was not operating as a going concern in the form envisaged at the time of
the Concession Agreement, because (i) the registration of used vehicles had been
suspended from 15 September 2000 and (ii) the Concessionaire was not operating as an
independent concern given the Secretariat’s First and Second Administrative
Interventions of 15 September 2000 and 18 April 2001. Moreover, as a business, the
Concessionaire had barely progressed beyond start-up operations by 15 September 2000,
at which time it began its suspended half-life until 24 June 2001. The Concessionaire had
therefore no significant or reliable track-record as a business, or ‘going concern’ by 24

June 2001, as that business was originally conceived under the Concession Agreement.

Based on these factors, the Tribunal next addresses the use of the Claimants’ DCF

method and the Respondent’s non-DCF methods to value the Claimants’ shares.

DCF Method: The Tribunal does not consider the DCF method to be an appropriate
methodology to apply on the facts of the present case; and it rejects the Claimants’ case
on the use of the DCF method. The Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s submissions to
the effect that the status of the Concessionaire as a business, during the period from
August/September 2000 up to the relevant valuation date of 24 June 2001, was far too
uncertain and incomplete to provide any sufficient factual basis for the DCF method.
Moreover, the Claimants’ use of the DCF method, with its expert (LECG), produces
figures for the Concessionaire’s future lost profits which are manifestly too high on the

facts found by the Tribunal.

Non-DCF Methods: Equally, the Tribunal rejects the Non-DCF methods advanced by
the Respondent. Neither the Asset Approach nor the Declared Tax Value Approach take
any account of the Concessionaire’s most valuable intangible asset as at 24 June 2001,
namely its future income stream reasonably anticipated from the Concession Agreement

under its remaining ten-year term. As a result, the Respondents’ use of these Non-DCF

Part XIII — Page 55

13-74

13-75

methods, with its expert (PRA), produce figures for the valuation of the Claimants’
shares which are manifestly too low. As regards the Respondent’s Expected Returns
Approach, the Tribunal accepts the Claimants’ objection that it is wrong in principle to
base such returns on the relatively small contributions made by the Claimants as the
Concessionaire’s minority shareholders. The Tribunal does not consider that the value
of the Claimants’ shares, on the facts of this case, bore any material relationship to the
Concessionaire’s future returns (or profits): this was to be a lucrative investment for the
Claimants, albeit subject to high risks. Moreover, this third approach by the Respondent

also produces figures which are manifestly too low.

Underlying Data: At the main hearing, the Respondent’s expert witness, Mr. Rién of
PRA, whilst disagreeing with the use of the DCF method, did not dispute the accuracy
of much of the underlying data used by LECG/Horwath. This material consensus
between the Parties’ quantum experts was summarized in the Claimants’ post-hearing

submissions, as follows [at paras. 39-40]:

“In cross-examination, Mr Rion conceded the accuracy of the background
information and assumptions used by LECG, the financial history and
Business Plan, the existence of a track record and even the status of
Renave as a going concern as at 20 August 2000. (D7.1469, 14 to 1470,2;
1473,9; 1475,1 to 1476,3; 1477,8 to 1478,4; other references in D7.1478,
further references in D7.1479; 1480; 1481; 1485; 1488; 1493; 1494;
1495; 1502; 1504,5-9; 1512, 16-21 (track record) and D.7,1513,1-1515,6
(going concern)). In light of these concessions, all the basic data relied on
by LECG for the purposes of proposing an income approach for the
question of valuation using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, have
been validated by the Respondent’s expert. They must be taken as
admitted.”

The Tribunal, whilst not accepting the Claimants’ characterisation of Mr. Ridn’s
independent testimony as a formal admission by the Respondent, nonetheless accepts, for
the purpose of its analysis, that much of LECG’s underlying data can be treated as

accurate, short of its application in the form of any DCF method.

The Tribunal’s Approach: Having rejected the Parties’ respective primary cases, as to
their respective DCF and Non-DCF methods, it is necessary for the Tribunal to steer an

appropriate middle course, between Scylla and Charybdis, given the Tribunal’s firm

Part XIII — Page 56

13-76

13-77

13-78

view that the Claimants’ shares in the Concessionaire must be valued by reference (inter
alia) to the Concessionaire’s reasonably anticipated loss of future profits assessed as at
24 June 2001, i.e. a modified form of the income-based approach using much of the

LECG/Horwath underlying data, albeit not using its DCF method.

In applying this approach to the facts of this case, as found by the Tribunal, difficulties
immediately arise from the significant uncertainties associated with that income stream
for the remaining 8.25 years of the Concession Agreement, as at 24 June 2001.
Collectively, those uncertainties made it improbable (but not impossible) that the
Concessionaire’s business would be fully restored and that, as a result, it would make
significant profits within the Concession’s remaining period, assuming the
Respondent’s compliance with its obligations towards the Claimants under the BITs.
Or, if expressed as a percentage, it was significantly more than 50% probable that the
Concessionaire would fail and significantly less than 50% possible that it would
succeed. With these evidential difficulties, it is necessary to return to first principles

applicable to this case.

The Two Arbitration Agreements: It will be recalled, from Part I (03) of this Award, that
the relevant arbitration agreements are contained in Article 10 of the Argentina BIT and
Article 9 of the France BIT respectively, as the source of this Tribunal’s arbitral
jurisdiction. Article 10(6) of the Argentina BIT specifies the scope of any arbitration
award under this treaty: it requires a determination by this Tribunal whether a breach of
the treaty “has caused a loss to the investor” and, if so, the fixing of “the amount of
compensatory indemnification for the damage suffered” by the aggrieved party, together
with “any applicable interest”; and it prohibits any order “for payment of punitive
damages.” Similarly, Article 9(8) of the France BIT provides for an award by this

Tribunal to include “monetary indemnification including interest ...”, excluding any

order to a Contracting Party “to pay punitive damages”.

These provisions of the two BITs, especially Article 10(6)(a) and Article 9(8)(b), are the

necessary starting-points in considering the potential scope of any award in these

Part XIII — Page 57

arbitration proceedings in respect of compensation for breach of the BITs by the

Respondent, as already found by the Tribunal earlier in this Award.

13-79 ILC: These provisions are materially consistent with the International Law
Commission’ Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.

These provide, as here relevant, regarding reparation under international law:

“Article 31- Reparation

1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for
the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the
internationally wrongful act of a State. [...]

Article 34 - Forms of Reparation

Full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act
shall take the form of restitution, compensation and satisfaction, either
singly or in combination, in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. [...]

Article 36 - Compensation

1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an
obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such
damage is not made good by restitution.

2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage
including loss of profits insofar as it is established.”

13-80 In the present case, restitution is not claimed by the Claimants; nor (if it were) would it
be appropriate or even possible. The Tribunal is here concerned only with reparation in
the form of compensation, as described in Article 36 of the ILC’s Articles. It is for the
Claimants, as claimants alleging an entitlement to such compensation, to establish the
amount of that compensation: the principle actori incumbit probatio is “the broad basic
rule to the allocation of the burden of proof in international procedure”. This burden

does not rest on a respondent, at least not initially.

'M. Kazazi, Burden of Proof and Related Issues (Kluwer, 1996), at pp. 116, 221 & 369.

Part XIII — Page 58

13-81

13-82

13-83

As to that compensation, Article 36 contains two express requirements, (i) that the
damage be “financially assessable”, i.e. capable of being evaluated in money, and that it
be “established”, i.e. such that the remedy be commensurate with the injured party’s
proven loss and thus make it whole in accordance with the general principle expressed
in The Chorz6w Factory Case as regards compensation for an illegal act (cited above in
Part XII of this Award). The Tribunal considers that this approach coincides with the
requirements of the two BITs, albeit expressed in slightly different wording. Under the
Argentine BIT, the compensation is expressed in the form of an indemnity for damage
suffered; and the France BIT likewise refers to an indemnity for loss or damage, both

necessarily to be made in money.

It is next necessary to consider the quality of evidential proof required of a claimant to
establish a claim, directly or indirectly, based on lost future profits under international

law. As explained in the ILC’s Commentary on Article 36(2):

“\.. lost profits have not been as commonly awarded in practice as
compensation for accrued losses. Tribunals have been reluctant to provide
compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements. When
compared with tangible assets, profits (and intangible assets which are
income-based) are relatively vulnerable to commercial, political and other
risks, and increasingly so the further into the future projections are made.
In cases where lost future profits have been awarded, it has been where an
anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be
considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be
compensable ...””

[Footnote omitted]

In this ILC Commentary (with certain materials there cited), there is an emphasis on
‘certainty’ to be established evidentially by a claimant in all cases; but it is clear from
other legal materials there cited that the concept of certainty is both relative and
reasonable in its application, to be adjusted to the circumstances of the particular case. It
suffices to cite two illustrative arbitral decisions, starting with Sapphire (cited in the

ILC Commentary on Article 36).

Part XIII — Page 59

13-84 Sapphire: The arbitrator in Sapphire International Petroleum, Ltd. v. National Iranian
Oil Company® (M. Pierre Cavin) awarded compensation of US $2 million for loss of
opportunity although the injured party could not establish actual loss of future profits:
“\.. in such cases the existence of damage is uncertain, case law has looked at the

position at the time when the opportunity was lost and has accepted that this

opportunity itself has a value whose loss gives rise to compensation"*. In that case, the
arbitrator also decided: “It is not necessary to prove the exact damage suffered in order

to award damages. On the contrary, when such proof is impossible, particularly as a

result of the behaviour of the author of the damage, it is enough for the judge to be able

to admit with sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage. ”

13-85 The Tribunal has noted that the arbitrator, in this case, fixed the amount of
compensation by reference to his powers “ex aequo et bono”. It is undisputed that this
Tribunal does not have power to decide any issue ex aequo et bono in these arbitration
proceedings: there is no express agreement by the Parties conferring any such power on
this Tribunal under Article 54(2) of the ICSID (Additional Facility) Arbitration Rules;
nor does this Tribunal assert or seek to exercise any such powers in this Award.
Nonetheless, as explained further below, it does not appear that this decision is

necessarily limited to a tribunal’s exercise of such special powers ex aequo et bono.

13-86 SPP: The arbitration tribunal in Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v.
Arab Republic of Egypt® (Dr. Mohamed Admin El Mahdi; Mr. Robert Pietrowski; and
Mr Eduardo Jimenez de Arachaga, President) awarded compensation for the claimant’s
loss of the opportunity of making a commercial success of the project in the sum of US$
3 million, although declining to award compensation by reference to any DCF
methodologies because the project was in its infancy with an insufficient history on
which to base projected revenues into the future. The tribunal decided that it was
incontestable on the evidential record that the claimants’ investment had a value that

exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses. The tribunal acknowledged that determining the

“opportunity of making a commercial success of the project” necessarily involved an
element of subjectivism and, consequently some uncertainty; however, it stated that “it
is well settled that the fact that damages cannot be assessed with certainty is no reason
not to award damages when a loss has been incurred”’; and the tribunal proceeded to

calculate such compensation, as follows:

“216. In determining the amount by which the value of the Claimants’
investment in ETDC exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses, the Tribunal
will take as a starting point the lot sales actually made during the short
life of the project and the revenues to be imputed to those sales. As the
Tribunal has already observed, the evidence show that during the period
February 1977 to May 1978, ETDC’s actual sales of villa and multi-
family sites amounted to US $10,211,000. The lots involved - 383 villa
sites and 3 multi-family sites represented only 6 percent of the villa sites
and less than I percent of the multi-family sites with respect to which
ETDC held rights. It is clear, therefore, that the remaining lots were a
potential source of very substantial revenues.

217. The Tribunal will next consider what it took in the way of expenditures by
the Claimants to generate the revenues imputed to the lot sales. The
difference between these expenditures and the portion of imputed revenues
corresponding to SPP(ME)’s shareholding in ETDC is, in the Tribunal’s
view, the minimum measure of the value to be ascribed to the opportunity
to make a commercial success of the project.

218. It is not disputed that SPP(ME) made capital contributions to ETDC of US
$1,310,000, and the Tribunal has already determined that the Claimants’
development costs were US $1,719,000. In addition, loans totalling US
$2,058,000 were made to ETDC, but these loans will be disregarded for
present purposes because they were intended to be reimbursed - for the
most part with interest at commercial rates. The portion of the revenues
imputed to the lot sales corresponding to SPP(ME)’s shareholding in
ETDC was 60 percent of US $10,211,000, or US $6,127,000. Thus, the
portion of the sales revenues corresponding to SPP (ME)’s shareholding
in ETDC would have exceeded the Claimants’ non-reimbursable out-of-
pocket expenses by US $3,098,000. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is
of the view that the value of which the Claimants have called the
“opportunity of making a commercial success of the project” was not less
than US $3,098,000. Stated differently, the value of the Claimants’
investment in May of 1978 when the project was cancelled exceeded their
out-of-pocket expenses by at least US $3,098,000.”

13-87 In a recent work, Ripinsky & Williams’ Damages in International Investment Law
(2008), these general principles as to loss of opportunity, or “loss of a chance”, were

summarised as follows:

“Where a tribunal cannot accept a claim for lost profits as not sufficiently
certain, it may choose to award, instead, a compensation for the loss of
business (commercial) opportunity, or for the loss of a chance. This head
of damage appears to be a sub-species of lost profits, which is resorted to
when the available data does not allow making a more precise calculation
of lost profits. The concept of the loss of opportunity, or the loss of a
chance, is recognised in a number of national legal systems, as well as in
the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts. The
latter provide in Article 7.4.3(2) that ‘[c]ompensation may be due for the
loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of its occurrence’. It is
suggested that a chance of making a profit is an asset with a value of its
own, and that compensation for the loss of a chance is an alternative to
the award of lost profits proper in cases where the claimant has failed to
prove the amount of the alleged loss of profit with the required degree of
certainty, but where the tribunal was satisfied that the loss in fact
occurred. Loss of a chance can thus be used as a tool allowing the injured
party to receive some form of compensation for the loss of a chance to
make a profit. In theory, the loss of a chance is assessed by reference to
the degree of probability of the chance turning out in the plaintiff's
favour, although in practice the amount awarded on this account is often
discretionary.”

[Footnotes omitted]

13-88 It may be noted that Article 7.4.3(1) of the UNIDROIT Principles? requires a
“reasonable degree of certainty” for establishing compensation for future harm, thereby
further confirming that the requirement for certainty in proving a claimant’s claim for
compensation is relative and not incompatible with an award of compensation for loss
of opportunity, nor is the latter necessarily linked to an arbitrator’s power to decide ex
aequo et bono'®. Indeed, the concept of damages for the loss of a chance (opportunity)

is recognised in many national systems of law; it is there also compatible with legal

8s. Ripinsky and K. Williams, Damages in International Investment Law (BIICL, 2008) at p. 291.

° The Tribunal notes the UNIDROIT Principles for the general proposition that lost profit is an accepted and well-
established component in assessing compensation [Cl. Quan. Rep., para. 13]: see Part XII above.

'© UNIDROIT Principles: Article 7.4.3 (Certainty of Harm) provides: “(1) Compensation is due only for harm,
including future harm, that is established with a reasonable degree of certainty. (2) Compensation may be due for the
loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of its occurrence. (3) Where the amount of damages cannot be
established with a sufficient degree of certainty, the assessment is at the discretion of the court.”

requirements to prove damages with a degree of certainty (including certainty on a
balance of probabilities); and it does not depend upon the tribunal or court acting ex

aequo et bono.

For example, English law has long recognised damages for the loss of a chance in both
contract and tort, ever since the decision of the Court of Appeal in Chaplin v Hicks
(1911)'' where the plaintiff was wrongly deprived of an opportunity, in breach of
contract, to win a beauty competition leading to employment as an actress. The jury
could not award her damages on the basis that she would have won the competition
because she was only one of 50 competitors from which only 12 winners could be
chosen; but she was nonetheless awarded substantial damages (£100, now equivalent to
about £8,000). On the defendant’s unsuccessful appeal, the Court of Appeal emphasised
that it remained legally possible to quantify the plaintiffs damages, on a balance of
probabilities under English law, even though her claim remained subject to future
contingencies making that exercise “not only difficult but incapable of being carried out
with certainty or precision”; and the Court rejected the notion “with emphasis” that,
because such precision was not possible, then no damages could be ordered at all. Other
common law jurisdictions have adopted a broadly similar approach to English law; and,
as a general approach albeit expressed in different terms, the concept is not foreign to

the laws of Mexico and Canada.

It would be possible to illustrate these general principles from several other national
legal systems (both common law and civilian); but it is unnecessary to do so here
because, first, such principles are broadly re-stated in the UNIDROIT Principles; and,
second, the Tribunal is in no doubt that similar principles form part of international law,
as expressed in the ILC Articles. Moreover, the law applicable in this case is not

English, Mexican, Canadian or any other national law.

Applying international law to the present case, the Tribunal is influenced by two related
factors. First, the Tribunal rejects any argument that because the quantification of loss

or damage in the form of lost future profits is uncertain or difficult, that the Claimants

" Chaplin v Hicks [1911] 2 KB 786; see also McGregor, Damages (18" ed; 2009), pp. 3421f.

Part XIII — Page 63

13-92

should be treated in this case as having failed to prove an essential element of their
claims in respect of lost future profits, with the result that their claims for compensation
should be dismissed. The Tribunal considers that this approach is not required by the
terms of either BIT or international law; and that it would also produce a harsh and
unfair result in this case. The Tribunal emphasises that it is here addressing contingent
future events and not actual past events; it is seeking to determine not what did or did
not happen as past facts but what could have happened in the future. This exercise
necessarily involves the Tribunal in assessing whether such future events would have
occurred and in quantifying that assessment in money terms, as compensation. It is not
always possible for a claimant to prove that a future event could or could not happen
with certainty; and a tribunal can only evaluate the chances of such a future event
happening. That is not therefore an exercise in certainty, as such; but it is, in the
circumstances, an exercise in “sufficient certainty”, as indicated by the ILC’s

Commentary cited above.

Second, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that the Claimant’s evidential difficulties in
proving their claim for loss of future profits are directly caused by the breaches of the
BITs by the Respondent responsible for such loss. If there had been no such breaches,
the Concessionaire would have had an opportunity to restore the project, as originally
envisaged; and it could then have been seen, as actual facts, whether and, if so, to what
extent the restored project would have been profitable for the Concessionaire and,
indirectly, the Claimants. The Tribunal considers that, as a general legal principle, when
a respondent has committed a legal wrong causing loss to a claimant (as found by a
tribunal), the respondent is not entitled to invoke the burden of proof as to the amount of
compensation for such loss to the extent that it would compound the respondent’s
wrongs and unfairly defeat the claimant’s claim for compensation - as was indicated in
the Sapphire award regarding the “behaviour of the author of the damage” (see above).
At this point, confronted by evidential difficulties created by the respondent’s own
wrongs, the tribunal considers that the claimant’s burden of proof may be satisfied to

the tribunal’s satisfaction, subject to the respondent itself proving otherwise.

The BITs: With this approach, it is helpful to return to the wording of Article 5 of the
two BITs. In the Argentina BIT, these provisions require the equivalent of the “market
value” of Talsud’s shares in the Concessionaire to be assessed, broadly defined to
include “other criteria that are appropriate to determine” such value; and in the France
BIT, these provisions require the equivalent of the ’fair market value, or in the absence
of such value, [of] actual value” of Gemplus’ shares in the Concessionaire to be
assessed, likewise broadly defined to include “any other criteria which, in the
circumstances, are appropriate to determine fair market value”. As a guide, the Tribunal
is content to apply this wording to its chosen valuation method, operating with the

Parties’ two extreme positions.

Accordingly, with this valuation method, the Tribunal next addresses, on the facts of
this case, the Concessionaire’s chances of future profits and seeks to quantify the
resulting compensation for the Claimants’ claims derived, indirectly, from those lost
profits in order to value the Claimants’ shares as at the relevant valuation date. This
method necessarily points to an answer lying between the Parties’ extreme positions;
but the issue addressed by the Parties and the Tribunal remains juridically the same,

namely: how to value in money terms the Claimants’ shares in the Concessionaire.

COMPENSATION FOR LOST OPPORTUNITY

As already indicated, the factual issue is how to assess, in money terms, the
Concessionaire’s lost opportunity (or chance) to make future profits for the remainder of
the Concession Agreement’s period of 8.25 years as at 24 June 2002 (recognising that

the Concession’s legal existence continued until the Requisition on 13 December 2002).

As found by the Tribunal, the project was by then already severely damaged from
earlier events for which the Respondent bears no liability under the BITs; and it
remained subject to several commercial, legal and political risks. Moreover, it was the

Respondent’s own efforts in September 2000 that kept the project even half alive (as

Part XIII — Page 65

13-97

13-98

13-99

regards new vehicles) and not destroyed completely by the twin calamities of
August/September 2000, namely the Cavallo incident and the death of Dr Ramos. But
for Dr Blanco’s efforts at the time (at the Secretariat), the Concessionaire would have
failed in or soon after September 2000. Moreover this half-life project, by 24 June 2001,
was far from the project originally envisaged with its business dependent on the

registration of both new and used vehicles.

This lost chance was clearly not 100%; nor was it manifestly 0%. In other words, even
if the Respondent had committed no breach of the BITs on and after 25 June 2001, the
several problems with the Concessionaire, the Concession Agreement, the Mexican
states, the amparos and, particularly, Mexican vehicle-owners and the Mexican public
generally, would have made it very difficult for the Concessionaire (with the
Secretariat) to restore the whole project. On the other hand, Mexico still needed a
comprehensive national vehicle registry in June 2001, perhaps more than ever before;
and that national registry was to occur much later in 2004. In June 2001, the
Concessionaire, but for the Respondent’s unlawful conduct, remained the logical
candidate to operate that registry, with at least a possibility (as Dr Blanco had intended
in September 2000) to re-new its activities for both used and new vehicles with the

support of the Respondent, acting lawfully under the two BITs.

In the Tribunal’s view, there was therefore as at 24 June 2001 no certainty or realistic
expectation of this project's profitability as originally envisaged, but there was
nonetheless a reasonable opportunity. That opportunity, however small, has a monetary
value for the purpose of Article 36 of the ILA Articles and the indemnities for

compensation provided by the two BITs.

It remains extremely difficult for the Tribunal to assess the value of this lost opportunity
in money terms. First, the commercial, legal, political and other risks confronting the
Concessionaire were considerable and are not susceptible to any useful analysis
expressed in percentages. Moreover, the Claimants’ claims for compensation are
necessarily based only indirectly on the Concessionaire’s future performance. Yet, the

hypothetical willing seller of the Claimants’ shares and their hypothetical willing buyer,

Part XIII — Page 66

13-100

(07)

13-101

as business people, would have been able to strike a price for such shares. It is a fact
that business people can agree a price notwithstanding expert accountants respectively
advising them that only a higher or lower price is appropriate. Second, the fact that this
exercise is difficult is due directly to the Respondent’s breaches of the two BITs which
have made it almost impossible for the Claimants to show how the Concessionaire
could or would have made use of that lost opportunity. As already decided by the
Tribunal above, it would be wrong in principle to deprive or diminish the Claimants of
the monetary value of that lost opportunity on lack of evidential grounds when that lack
of evidence is directly attributable to the Respondent’s own wrongs. This is not
therefore a case where the burden of proof lay exclusively on the Claimants: and, in the

Tribunal’s view, it was also for the Respondent to prove the contrary. It did not do so.

Having in mind all the legal principles and other factors above, taking the hypothetically
willing buyer and willing seller materially informed as to their intended transaction on
24 June 2001, the Tribunal determines in the exercise of its arbitral discretion that the
price agreed by these hypothetical parties for the Claimants’ shares in the
Concessionaire would have been (in total) the sum of MXN 130,000,000 or US$
14,340,872 (at the then prevailing rate of exchange: MXN 9.065 = US$1). The Tribunal
prefers to express this price in US$ for reasons explained later in Part XVI of this

Award.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

As regards the Claimants’ claims for compensation for the lost value of their respective
shares in the Concessionaire as at 24 June 2001, whether advanced as the Respondent’s
liability for unlawful expropriation or breach of the FET standards in the two BITs or
both, the Tribunal decides the Claimants’ loss to be proven in these arbitration

proceedings in the total amount of US $ 14,340,872, i.e. US$ 5,853,417 for Gemplus (as

Part XIII — Page 67

to its 20% shareholding in the Concessionaire) and US$ 8,487,455 for Talsud (as to its

29% shareholding in the Concessionaire).

PART XIV: ISSUE J - COMPENSATION: PAST PAYMENTS

INTRODUCTION

The Tribunal here considers the effect of the Claimants’ receipt of certain amounts from
the Concessionaire in April and December 2002, to which reference was made earlier in
Part XII of this Award (Paragraph 12-44). It is again necessary first to summarise the

Parties’ submissions in regard to these “distributions”.

THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

The Claimants address the issue of distributions effected to the Concessionaire’s
shareholders (including the Claimants) during the Second Administrative Intervention,

as follows (Memorial at 72):

“218. Despite the traumatic history of the Concessionaire’s operations and the
manifest intention of the Government of Mexico to frustrate the operation
of the Mexico Concession and terminate the Concession Agreement, some
profits were realised and distributions made. In_2002 the Secretariat
authorised payments by the Concessionaire to the shareholders including
the Claimants by way of dividends, return of capital and reimbursement
for start up costs. These payments, summarised in LECG/Horwath Letter
(paragraphs [16-17]), exceeded the shareholders’ contributions by a
modest margin. The Claimants have therefore addressed at this stage the
question whether by any conceivable measure these distributions can be
considered to be compensation for the loss of profit which would have
been realised but for the actions taken by the Secretariat.”

Part XIV — Page 1

[Emphasis added]

14-3 The Claimants’ expert, LECG/Horwath, note of the distributions to the Claimants in
their first letter dated 7 October 2005, as follows (LECG Letter, at 6):

“16. A total sum of MXN $ 23,506,699 was received by Talsud by way of
dividends and return of capital. Gemplus received a total sum of MXN $
15,881,206 by way of dividends and return of capital. Dividends were
paid in December 2002. The return of capital was made in December
2002. A summary of these payments is presented in Schedule 5 attached.
Applying the current rate of exchange of USD $ 1 = MXN $ 10.8, the
aggregate value of distributions received by Talsud is USD $ 2,176,546
and the aggregate value of distributions received by Gemplus is USD $
1,470,482.

17. In April 2002, a payment was made to the shareholders of Renave as a
reimbursement for start-up costs previously incurred by the shareholders.
Talsud was reimbursed MXN $ 7,250,000 and Gemplus was reimbursed
MXN $ 5,000,000.

18. All distributions appear to have been made to shareholders proportionate
to their respective share holdings.”

14-4 In their second letter dated 9 October 2006, LECG/Horwath further address this issue
(LECG October 9 Letter at 13):

“34. We have been referred to paragraph 401 of the Counter-Memorial and to
paragraph 26 of the witness statement of Mr. Guillermo Gonzalez
concerning return of capital and other payments to the Renave
shareholders. We have verified that as of December 16, 2002, before
certain distributions, Renave had reported net cash and investments of
MXN $143,827,480. We have also verified the data set out in the table
appearing in paragraph 400 of the Counter-Memorial to payment source
documents with respect to Talsud and Gemplus. A total sum of MXN
$23,506,699 was received by Talsud by way of dividends and return of
capital. Gemplus received a total sum of MXN $15,881,206 by way of
dividends and return of capital. Dividends were paid in December 2002.
The return of capital was made in December 2002.”

[Footnotes omitted]

14-5 In their Memorial on Quantum, the Claimants contend that whilst the amount of
distributions paid by the Respondent is not in dispute, the Parties dispute the effect of

these payments on the assessment of the Claimants’ losses (Quan. Mem. at 6-7):

Part XIV — Page 2

“15.

16.

17.

18.

19.

Capital contributions were made by the Claimants throughout the active
life of the concession. LECG/Horwath record two capital contributions in
September 1999 and further contributions in December 1999, February
2000, July 2000, December 2000 and June 2001. Talsud contributed a
total sum of MXN$21,406,000 and Gemplus contributed a total of
MXN$14,495,000. These contributions were made on the expectation that
there would be significant return on the investment.

The Respondents’ Counter Memorial makes reference to the return of
capital and other payments to the shareholders of Renave. This is
common ground between the Parties except for minor differences on the
value of reimbursement to Talsud and Gemplus of certain start-up costs.
There is also agreement on the amount of distributions paid by way of
dividends and return of capital. In cash terms, Talsud received a total sum
of MXN$23,506,699 (against a total contribution of MXN$21,406,000)
and Gemplus received a total distribution of MXN$15,881,206 (against a
total contribution of MXN$14,495,000). Both distributions were made in
December 2002.

The return of capital and other payments to the shareholders occurred at
various stages in 2002, after the date of the Seizure which was declared
by decree on 27 June 2001. In her first witness statement, Ma. Elena
Barrera Sanchez [sic], who was employed as Administration and Finance
Manager of Renave until the date of the Seizure, says the following:-

“[w]ith the Seizure, the authorisation to sign cheques that the
company and its representatives had granted me was cancelled.
However, as from 27 June 2001 onwards, new signatories were
arranged for the bank accounts and I was included among them. I
could not take any decision of any kind without the prior approval
of my immediate superior, Guillermo Gonzalez Lozano.”

It is unclear whether the Respondent advances an argument that the
distributions received by the shareholders in 2002 represent sufficient
compensation of the Seizure, for prior interventions or for the subsequent
Revocation of the concession. Certainly, the distributions were never
accepted as such and for the reasons advanced below it is the Claimants’
case that the distributions were very far from being adequate
compensation for the loss in the value of their investment caused by the
actions of the Secretariat.

These payments fall far short of the value of the Claimants’ contributions
in cash and kind, and provide no return at all on the investment that has
been made, or anything by way of compensation for loss of future profits.
The evidence in the LECG/Horwath Report is that, after taking into
account the period of time that elapsed between the contributions made
and distributions received by the Claimants, inflation during this period

Part XIV — Page 3

14-6

14-7

and other economic factors, the value of the Claimants’ contributions at
the time they were made exceeds the value of the distributions at the time
they were received so that in terms of value both the Claimants received
less than they invested. From a financial perspective, the Claimants made
a loss on their investment.”

[Footnotes omitted]

LECG/Horwath further describe the distributions to the Claimants in their first expert

report as follows (LECG First Expert Report at 17-18):

“60. A total sum of MXN $ 23,506,699 was received by Talsud by way of
dividends and return of capital. Gemplus received a total sum of MXN $
15,881,206 by way of dividends and return of capital. Dividends were paid
in December 2002. The return of capital was made in December 2002. On
a present value basis, as of August 20, 2000, the value of Talsud’s
distributions is MXN §$ 16,934,344 and the value of Gemplus’ distributions
is MXN $ 11,440,956. A Summary of these payments is presented in
Schedule 12 attached.

ol. In April 2002, a payment was made to the shareholders of Renave as a
reimbursement for start-up costs previously incurred by the shareholders.
Talsud was reimbursed MXN $ 7,250,000 and Gemplus was reimbursed
MXN $ 5,000,000.

62. All distributions appear to have been made to shareholders proportionate
to their respective share holdings.”

The amounts estimated by LECG/Horwath above were derived from its calculation of
cash distributions set out in Schedule 12 to its first expert report, which provided as

(03) THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

14-9 The Respondent’s case on the distributions to the Claimants was pleaded as follows

(Counter-Memorial at 119-120):

“399. On 12 November 2002, Mr. Salvador Fonseca sent two letters to
Professor Gomez Mont informing her: i) that on 8 November 2002 the
Concessionaire’s shareholders held an extraordinary meeting in which
they decided to reduce the variable portion of the company’s capital by
63.8 million pesos, and ii) that on 3 October 2002 the Concessionaire’s

Part XIV — Page 5

14-10

shareholders held an ordinary shareholders meeting, in which they
decided to pay out a dividend of 233.61 pesos per share.

400. The payments would be made in accordance with each shareholders’
stake in the company, that is, 51% to Aplicaciones Informdticas, S.A. de
C.V., 29% to Talsud, S.A. and 20% to Gemplus Industrial, S.A. de C.V., as
shown in the following table:

401. According to the testimony of Mr. Guillermo Gonzdlez, the shareholders
also received payments for technical consultation fees (Aplicaciones
Informdaticas received 14.7 million pesos, Gemplus Industrial 5.6 million
pesos and Talsud received 961,896 US dollars); they received the
company [sic] with a balance of 140 million in cash and investments (a
part of which was apparently used to pay out the 63 million pesos
reimbursement of capital) and received additional monies through the
liquidation of assets.””

[Footnotes omitted]

In its Rejoinder on the Merits, the Respondent submits

that the Claimants were, in

effect, made whole by these distributions (Rejoinder at 40-41):

“D. The Claimants recovered a sum larger than the capital they had
invested in the Concessionaire

113. Mexico’s fourth point is that it is an admitted fact that the
Concessionaire’s shareholders received a return on their capital invested,
a dividend, and payment for their services rendered in the start-up phase
of the project. This is not a case where the investor-claimant has suffered
a complete or even partial loss of its investment. These investors were
more than made whole.

Part XIV — Page 6

1. They Received a Return of Capital, a Dividend, and Payment for
Services Rendered

114. The evidence shows that while the company was in requisition:

. The shareholders withdrew their variable capital (US$6.2 million),
which left them with their fixed capital, which on Renave’s date of
incorporation, was worth approximately US$290,000.00 (for
Talsud) and US$200,000.00 (for Gemplus).

. The shareholders also authorized the Concessionaire to declare a
dividend. This more than covered their fixed capital commitments.

. Finally, when they received the company back at the end of the
revocation proceeding, the shareholders received a significant
cash balance.

115. Thus, by exercising their powers to control the company’s finances while
it was in requisition, the shareholders more than made themselves whole
in respect of the capital that they put at risk. They nevertheless now seek
damages for loss of future profits which they contend the Concessionaire
“stood to make” but for the Secretariat's measures in response to the
events of August-September 2000.

116. In Mexico’s submission, it is anomalous, to say the least, that having
gotten back more than they actually invested, the Claimants still contend
that they have suffered an expropriation of their investments.”

[Footnotes omitted]

14-11 In its Counter-Memorial on Quantum, the Respondent further contends that no further

amount is required to compensate the Claimants (Quan. CM at 15-16):

“48. It is common ground that while Renave was in requisition, the
shareholders used their control to effect three forms of cash transfers to
themselves: (i) a payment for services rendered in starting up the
company; (ti) a dividend; and (ii) a return of all variable capital.

49. The First Memorial on Quantum notes that Talsud received a total sum of
P$23,506,699 (against a total contribution of P$21,406,000) and Gemplus
received a total of P$15,881,206 (against a total contribution of
P$14,495,000). Thus, in nominal terms, without taking into consideration
the time value of the monies invested, the Claimants received a slightly
greater amount than they originally invested. If inflation is taken into
account, that is, if the amounts are expressed in terms of pesos with the

Part XIV — Page 7

purchasing power of August 2000, the Claimants received
$20,600,813.62, pesos and $13,917,979.93 pesos. The difference with
respect to their capital contributions in both cases is slightly greater than
one million pesos.

50. The First Memorial on Quantum asserts that these payments fall far short
of the Claimants’ contributions in cash and kind, since they provide no
return at all on the investment that has been made, or anything by way of
compensation for loss of future profits. On a present value basis as of the
valuation date, the difference between the transfers received by Renave’s
shareholders and the monies invested in the project as of 20 August 2000
is between P$1.7 and P$2.1 million in the case of Gemplus and between
P$2.1 and P$2.7 million in the case of Talsud.

Sl. In addition to essentially making the investors whole, the return of
variable capital raises additional complications for the Claimants’ use of
a DCF valuation for a simple but fundamental reason: DCF calculations
are predicated upon the investor's putting a sum of capital at risk in the
belief that the present value of future income streams generated by that
capital will be greater than the capital itself (i.e., the investment has a
positive Net Present Value) and that larger streams might not be
generated by placing that capital in another investment (i.e., it is the best
option available to the investor). The future income stream is inextricably
linked to the capital invested. This means that once the variable capital
was withdrawn from the company, the income stream that could flow from
it ended. It was no longer committed to generating future income streams
from this company. No DCF calculation can validly include it because
without that capital investment the investors would not be entitled to any
cash flow from Renave.

52. LECG/Horwath treated the variable capital withdrawal in the following
way: (i) they ran the DCF calculation as if the capital in fact remained
committed to Renave for the entire 10 year period; and (ii) they then
subtracted the amount that had been withdrawn in 2002 from the resulting
valuation. In other words, the capital is treated as committed for roughly
8 years after it was withdrawn and then subtracted from the inflated
figure. Yet since the time of its withdrawal in 2002, that capital has been
put to other uses by both Claimants.”

14-12 The Respondent’s case is supported by PRA’s first expert report, in which the following

observations are made by the Respondent’s expert (PRA First Expert Report at 32-33):

“141. Now, as per the LECG Report’s own methodology, once it arrives at its
DCF valuation result for 100% of the shares of Renave, it goes on to

calculate the implicit value for Talsud and Gemplus, who had a 29% and
20% equity participation in Renave. It then subtracts from this value the
cash distributions that Talsud and Gemplus actually received after the
Valuation Date, and also subtracts the current value of Renave’s shares.

The LECG Report discounted the received cash distributions by the same
discount rate used in its model, namely 15%. However, since these [sic] is
no uncertainty (or risk) about these cash flows (i.e. it is a reality that they
were actually disbursed to Talsud and Gemplus), the appropriate discount
rate is the risk-free rate. As discussed, the Mexican risk-free rate is the
CETEs rate. For the period between the Valuation date and December of
2002 (which is when Talsud and Gemplus received their dividend
[December 4, 2002] and the return of capital [December 31, 2002]), the
average 364-day CETEs rate was 12.14%.

If we apply the 12.14% risk-free rate to the LECG Report's calculation of
the present value of the distributions actually received by Talsud and
Gemplus, we obtain a value of $18.0 million pesos for Talsud, and of
$12.1 million pesos for Gemplus.

Although the Respondent provided alternative figures for damages in its post-hearing
submissions, the Respondent did not provide a like break-down of distribution payments

to the Claimants.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

As to the facts, it is necessary to distinguish between the three different payments made
to the Claimants: (i) the reimbursement of past expenses; (ii) dividends and (iii) the

return of capital.

Expenses: As to the reimbursement of expenses paid by the Concessionaire, as
authorised by the Respondent during the First Administrative Intervention, Gemplus
received MXN 5,000,000 and Talsud received MXN 7,250,000 in April 2002. These
expenses had been incurred by Gemplus and Talsud for the Concessionaire during the
start-up of the project; and their reimbursement was made to the Claimants effectively
as creditors of the Concessionaire. Moreover, these expenses had been incurred for the
Concessionaire long before the relevant valuation date, 24 June 2001 and even before
the First Administrative Intervention. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that these
payments were made under a separate transaction and independently of the Claimants’
status as the Concessionaire’s shareholders and of the value of the Claimants’ shares in

the Concessionaire as at the valuation date.

Dividends: As to the dividends paid by the Concessionaire, as authorised by the
Respondent during the Requisition, Gemplus received MXN 3,386,206.05 and Talsud
received MXN 5,000,698.63 on 4 December 2002. The minutes of the Concessionaire’s

extraordinary shareholders' meeting of 8 November 2002 approved the payment of these

Part XIV — Page 10

14-17

14-18

14-19

dividends for the year ending 31 December 2001 [R-178]. These amounts were to be
paid in November 2002, but they were not actually paid to the Claimants until 4
December 2002. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that these payments were made to
the Claimants as the Concessionaire’s shareholders; but that half of these payments
relate to the period preceding the relevant valuation date, 24 June 2001: ie. MXN
1,693,103 for Gemplus and MXN 2,500,349 for Talsud.

Capital: As to the return of variable capital in the Concessionaire, as authorised by the
Respondent, Gemplus received MXN 12,495,000 and Talsud received MXN 18,506,000
on 30 December 2002 after the Revocation. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that

these payments were made to the Claimants as the Concessionaire’s shareholders.

The Tribunal has determined above, in Part XIII of this Award (subject to this Part
XIV), that the Claimants are entitled to compensation as at 24 June 2001 in the amount
of US$ 5,178,022 for Gemplus and US$ 7,508,133 for Talsud, as the value of their
shares in the Concessionaire based on Concessionaire’s lost chance of future profits.
The legal question arises whether any of the three distributions fall to be deducted from

these amounts of compensation; and it is again appropriate to address each in turn.

Capital: In order to allow the Concessionaire an opportunity to earn those future profits,
the Tribunal considers that the Claimants would have had to maintain their variable
capital in the Concessionaire. Without such capital, provided by all the Concessionaire’s
shareholders, the Concessionaire’s opportunity to make these profits would have been
substantially diminished, if not actually extinguished. Nor does the Tribunal think it
reasonable to assume that the Claimants could have withdrawn their own variable
capital, leaving the majority shareholder to continue as to 51% of such capital. This
approach is consistent with the Claimants’ methodology which likewise deducted these
returns of capital from their claims for compensation (albeit subject to certain interest

and exchange calculations, within the context of their DCF method). The Tribunal notes

Part XIV — Page 11

14-20

14-21

14-22

14-23

14-24

that such an approach is not limited to the use of DCF methods but extends to other

methods for assessing lucrum cessans, so as to avoid double counting!.

Moreover, the Tribunal’s valuation of the Claimants’ shares assumes a hypothetical sale
on 24 June 2001: see Paragraphs 13-100 & 13-101 of Part XIII above. That sales’
hypothetical price assumes the full value of the Claimants’ shares; and it must therefore
follow that a later return of capital to the Concessionaire’s shareholders would have
benefited the new notional purchaser and not the old notional seller, such as the

Claimants.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants’ distributions as to return of
capital on 30 December 2002, in the sums of MXN 12,495,000 for Gemplus and MXN.
18,506,000 for Talsud must be deducted from these two amounts of compensation
assessed as at 24 June 2001, subject to adjustment for currency exchange rates and

interest.

Dividends: The position as regards the dividend is, in part, materially similar. Given the
valuation date of 24 June 2001, it must follow that the part of these dividend relating to
the period after the hypothetical sale of 24 June 2001 to 31 December 2001 would have
benefited the new notional buyer and not the old notional seller, such as the Claimants
(in contrast to the part relating to the period before 24 June 2001 which would benefit

the seller).

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants’ distributions as to dividends in
December 2002, in the sums of MXN 1,693,103 for Gemplus and MXN 2,500, 349 for
Talsud must be deducted from these two amounts of compensation assessed as at 24

June 2001, subject to adjustment for currency exchange rates and interest.

Expenses: The position regarding the reimbursement of expenses is materially different.
The Tribunal considers that none of these distributions should be deducted from the two

amounts of compensation. These payments were not received by the Claimants as

PART XV: © CONCLUSION AND SUMMARY

Introduction: The Tribunal here summarises its decisions in this Award so far, as
regards Issues A-J (subject to interest, currency and costs), by reference also to the

Parties’ respective claims for relief set out above in Part 1(06) of this Award.

Issue A - Jurisdiction: As determined in Part V of this Award, the Tribunal decides
to assume jurisdiction over all the claims pleaded against the Respondent in these
arbitration proceedings by Gemplus (Gemplus S.A.), having competence to do so
(as with all Talsud’s pleaded claims); the Tribunal decides that it has no jurisdiction
in regards to the claims pleaded by Gemplus Industrial (Gemplus Industrial S.A. de
C.V.); and, whilst the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims pleaded by SLP (SLP
S.A.), the latter’s claims must fail in limine on the primary case advanced by the
Gemplus Claimants themselves (including SLP). Accordingly, in addressing the
merits of Claimants’ substantive claims in this Award, the reference to “the

Claimants” should be understood as referring only to Gemplus and Talsud.

To this extent only, the Tribunal grants the relief claimed by the Claimants set out in
Paragraphs 1-52(A)(1) and 1-52(B)(1) of this Award and dismisses the relief

claimed by the Respondent set out in Paragraph 1-53 of this Award.

Issue B - Liability General Approach: As determined (inter alia) in Part VI of this
Award, the Tribunal addresses the Claimants’ claims in this Award only as treaty
claims under the respective Argentina and France BITs (together with international
law) and not as contractual claims under the Concession Agreement or
infringements of Mexican law; and the Tribunal treats the Claimants as different and

distinct legal persons from both the Concessionaire and its majority shareholder.

Issue C - FET: As determined in Part VII of this Award, the Tribunal does not
consider that the Claimants established any claim for breach of the fair and equitable
standards (FET) in Article 3 of the Argentina BIT or Article 4 of the France BIT

based on events prior to 25 June 2001 when the Respondent’s Secretariat ordered the

Part XV — Page 1

15.6.

15.7.

15.8.

15.9.

15.10.

15.11.

Requisition. The Tribunal decides, conversely, that the Claimants established their
FET claims in regard to both the Requisition of 25 June 2001 and the Revocation of
13 December 2002, with the interim period comprising composite acts consequential
upon the Secretariat’s decisions in regard to the Requisition and Revocation. For the
purpose of establishing the first date of the FET breaches of both BITs by the
Respondent, whether as a completed act or as the first of series of composite acts,

the Tribunal decides that date as 25 June 2001.

To this extent only, the Tribunal grants the relief claimed by the Claimants set out in

Paragraphs 1-50(i)(1) and 1-51 of this Award.

Issue D - Expropriation: As determined in Part VIII of this Award, the Tribunal
decides that the Claimants’ investments were unlawfully expropriated by the
Respondent, indirectly with the Requisition on 25 June 2001 and directly with the
Revocation on 13 December 2002, both in violation of Article 5 (1) of the Argentina
BIT and Article 5 (1) of the France BIT, with the interim period comprising
composite acts consequential upon the Secretariat’s decisions in regard to the
Requisition and Revocation. For the purpose of establishing the first date of the
breaches of both BITs as regards unlawful expropriation by the Respondent, whether
as a completed act or as the first of a series of composite acts, the Tribunal decides

that date as 25 June 2001.

To this extent only, the Tribunal grants the relief claimed by the Claimants set out in

Paragraphs 1-50(i)(4)&(5) and 1-51 of this Award.

Issue E — ‘Protection and Security’: As determined in Part IX of this Award, the
Tribunal decides that the Claimants have not established any breach of the
‘protection’ provisions in Article 4 of the France BIT and Article 3 of the Argentina

BIT; and these claims are therefore dismissed by the Tribunal.

To this extent, the Tribunal rejects the relief claimed by the Claimants set out in

Paragraph 1-50(i)(3) and 1-51 of this Award.

Issue F —- NLF/MFN “National Security”: As determined in Part X of this Award,
the Tribunal decides that, as the ‘national security’ provision in Article 2(5) of the
Argentina BIT (NLF/MEN) was never invoked by the Respondent as a defence to

Talsud’s claim (or any other claim by any of the Claimants), no decision in respect

Part XV — Page 2

15.12.

15.13.

15.14.

15.15.

of the Claimants’ submissions is required of the Tribunal, save to dismiss them as

otiose in these arbitration proceedings.

To this extent only, the Tribunal rejects the relief claimed by the Claimants set out in

Paragraphs 1-50(i)(2) and 1-51 of this Award.

Issue G — Causation and Fault: As determined in Part XI of this Award, the
Tribunal decides that the Respondent’s unlawful conduct under the France and
Argentina BITs caused loss to the Claimants, to which neither of these Claimants
materially contributed for the purpose of extinguishing or reducing the Respondent’s

liability to pay compensation to these Claimants.

Issue H — Compensation General Approach: As determined (inter alia) in Part XII
of this Award, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants’ claims for compensation
derive only from their status as investors with investments in the form of their
respective minority shareholdings in the Concessionaire, as distinct from any claim
by the Concessionaire itself (or its majority shareholder); that the Claimants’ shares
in the Concessionaire are currently worthless and have been so, effectively, from 31
December 2002; that both under international law and (directly or by analogy)
Article 5 of the France and Argentina BITs, the relevant date for assessing
compensation due to the Claimants is 24 June 2001 (being the day preceding the
unlawful Requisition of 25 June 2001); and that the period of the Concession
Agreement is to be treated as not extending beyond 14 September 2009, i.e. 8.25

years after the Requisition of 25 June 2001.

Issue I — Compensation Lost Future Profits: As determined in Part XIII of this
Award in regard to the Claimants’ claims for compensation for the lost value of their
respective shares in the Concessionaire as at 24 June 2001 (whether advanced as the
Respondent’s liability for unlawful expropriation or for breach of the FET standards
in the France and Argentina BITs or both), the Tribunal decides the Claimants’ loss
to be proven in these arbitration proceedings in the total amount of US$ 14,340,872 ,
i.e. US$ 5,853,417 for Gemplus (as to its 20% shareholding in the Concessionaire)
and US$ 8,487,455 for Talsud (as to its 29% shareholding in the Concessionaire) —

subject to Issues J and K.

Part XV — Page 3

15.16.

15.17.

15.18.

Issue J — Compensation Past Payments: As determined in Part XIV of this Award,
the Tribunal decides that, as at 30 December 2002, Gemplus had received the
equivalent of US$ 1,370,253 and Talsud had received the equivalent of US$
2,028,734 as dividends and return of capital, to be deducted from the compensation
assessed as at 24 June 2001 (in the amounts of US$ 5,853,417 for Gemplus and US$
8,487,455 for Talsud), thereby producing the lower figures of US$ 4,483,164 for
Gemplus and US$ 6,458,721 for Talsud as compensation due by the Respondent -

subject to Issue K below.

To this extent only, the Tribunal grants the relief claimed by the Claimants set out in
Paragraphs 1-SO(ii), 1-5, 1-52(A)(2) and 1-52(B)(2) of this Award and dismisses the

relief claimed by the Respondent set out in Paragraph 1-53 of this Award.

Issues K & L: The Tribunal considers Issues K and L, as to Currency & Interest and

Legal & Arbitration Costs respectively, in Parts XVI and XVII of this Award below.

PART XVI: ISSUE K —- CURRENCY AND INTEREST

INTRODUCTION

In this part of the Award, the Tribunal considers the appropriate currency and interest to
apply to the sums calculated as compensation for the Respondent’s breach of the two
BITs in regard to the FET standards and unlawful expropriation, as decided by the

Tribunal in Parts XII, XIII, XIV and XV of this Award.

Neither BIT provides expressly for the specific currency or interest applicable in the
case of a breach of the FET standards or unlawful expropriation, in contrast to

compensation for lawful expropriation under Article 5 of the two BITs.

Article 5(4) of the Argentina BIT provides as to lawful expropriation, in relevant part,

as follows:

“4. The amount paid shall be no less than the equivalent amount which would
have been paid as indemnification on the date of expropriation in a freely-

 

 

 

 

 

convertible currency on the internati l financial market, that currency
having been converted to the standard market ion_on the date of
Li plus interest corr ding toa ble commercial rate for
that currency until the date of payment.”
[Emphasis added]

Article 5(3) of the France BIT provides likewise, in relevant part, as follows:

3. The indemnification shall be equivalent to the fair market value or, in the
absence of such value, to the actual value of the expropriated or
nationalized investment immediately before the expropriation or
nationalization was carried out and shall not reflect any changes in the
value which arise as a result of the expropriation becoming known prior
to the date of expropriation. Valuation criteria shall include going

Part XVI — Page |

16-5

(02)

16-7

16-8

concern value, asset value including the declared tax value of tangible

property and_any other criteria which, _in_the_circi umstances, are
appropriate_to determine fair market value. The afor
indemnification, its amount and its mode of payment shall be fixed no later

than the date of deprivation. Indemnification will be subject to interest

calculated at the applicable market rate until the date of payment.”
[Emphasis added]

As to appropriate currency for lawful expropriation, it will be noted that the Argentina
BIT expressly refers to an amount “in a freely-convertible currency on the international
financial market, that currency having been converted to the standard market quotation
on the date of valuation ...”. In contrast, the France BIT has no express provision
regarding the currency in which such compensation is payable by the Respondent for

breach of the BIT, save for the broad reference to “any other criteria.”

As to appropriate interest for lawful expropriation, it will be noted that both BITs
provide expressly for interest. The Argentina BIT provides for pre-award and post-
award interest from the date of valuation “corresponding to a reasonable commercial
rate for that currency.” The France BIT likewise provides for pre-award and post-award

interest from the date of valuation “calculated at the applicable market rate”

THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

As to currency, as already noted above, the Claimants seek an order for compensation
calculated in Mexican currency as at the date of valuation but converted for payment by
the Respondent into the currency of the United States of America, using an exchange

rate as of the date of the Award (Claimants’ Post-Hearing Br., para 70 at 20).

As to interest, the Claimants submit that the BITs respectively require interest at a
“reasonable commercial rate for that currency” (Argentina BIT, Art. 5.4) and at the
“applicable market rate” (France BIT, Art. 5.3). It is the Claimants’ contention that

these provisions both express the standard prescribed by international law for the

Part XVI — Page 2

16-9

calculation of interest, citing the following passage from Brower and Sharpe, Awards of

Compound Interest in International Arbitration (Quan. Mem. at 82):

Although the BITs are silent as to whether interest should be compounded or not, the

Claimants contend that current arbitral practice supports the compounding of interest

“TiJnternational arbitral tribunals consistently award interest to
prevailing parties as compensation for the temporary withholding of their
money. The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal has noted that ‘it is
customary for arbitral tribunals to award interest as part of an award for
damages’, even in ‘the absence of any express reference to interest in the
compromis’. Indeed, arbitral tribunals’ inherent authority to award
interest is so well recognized, and is of such fundamental importance, that
the right to interest has become part of the lex mercatoria.”

(Quan. Mem. at 29-31):

“85.

87.

88.

89.

The current practice of international arbitral tribunals demonstrates that
compounding interest is a commercially reasonable practice and is
appropriate in this case. According to Mann, “compound interest may be
and, in the absence of special circumstances, should be awarded to the
claimant as damages by international tribunals.”

[ou]

Professor Gotanda, a recognised expert on the subject of damages and
compensation in international arbitration, agrees:

‘[iJn the modern world of international commerce, almost all
financing and investment vehicles involve compound, as opposed
to simple, interest. [...] By awarding compound interest, therefore,
the model avoids leaving the claimant in a much worse position
than it would have been in had the money owed been timely paid.’

ICSID tribunals have awarded compound interest in recent expropriation

cases. In Wena v. Egypt the Tribunal found that compound interest “is
generally appropriate in most modern commercial arbitrations,” adding:

‘[lJike the distinguished panel in the recently-issued Metalclad
decision, this Tribunal also has determined that compounded
interest will best ‘restore the Claimant to a_ reasonable
approximation of the position in which it would have been if the
wrongful act had not taken place.’

The Annulment Committee in the Wena case confirmed the Tribunal’s
determination of the interest award. In doing so, the former stated that

Part XVI — Page 3

90.

91.

international law and ICSID practice offered a variety of alternatives that
include the compounding of interests. The Annulment Committee
considered such a determination of interest compatible with the s lard
of compensation required by international law:

 

‘compensation must be, first, ‘prompt, adequate and effective’ and,
second, ‘compensation shall amount to the market value of the
investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation
itself. Although not referring to interest, the provision must be read
as including a determination of interest that is compatible with
those two principles. In particular, the compensation must not be
eroded by the passage of time or by the diminution in the market
value. The award of interest that reflects such international
business practices meets these two objectives.

The option the Tribunal took was in the view of this Committee
within the Tribunal’s power. International law and ICSID practice,
unlike the Egyptian Civil Code, offer a variety of alternatives that
are compatible with those objectives. These alternatives include
the compounding of interest in some cases. Whether among the
many alternatives are variable under such practice the Tribunal
chose the most appropriate in the circumstances of the case is not
for this Committee to say as such matter belongs to the merits of
the decision [...]’

In Compaiiia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. The Republic of Costa
Rica, the tribunal also found it appropriate to award interest, compounded
annually:

‘In particular, where an owner of property has at some earlier
time lost the value of his asset but has not received the monetary
equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of
compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum
that his money would have earned, had it, and the income
generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing
rates of interest. It is not the purpose of compound interest to
attribute blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the
payment made to the expropriated owner; it is a mechanism to
ensure that the compensation awarded the Claimant is appropriate
in the circumstances.’

Other ICSID tribunals have also awarded compound interest; as have
tribunals in NAFTA cases and other investment disputes.”

The Claimants submit that this approach is consistent with the determination of their
expert, LECG/Horwath of the most appropriate rate of interest in this case - the rate of
return that would have been available to the Claimants but for their investment in the
Concessionaire, that is the CETES (Certificados de la Tesoria de la Federacién) 364 day
Mexican government bond rate, compounded annually, at the lowest yielding rate in
their calculations (LECG First Expert Report, paras. 66-67 at 18-19; Claimants’ Post-
Hearing Br., para. 87 at 23).

(03) THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

16-12

16-13

16-14

As to currency, the Respondent submits that, because the Claimants expected to earn
Mexican pesos through their investment in the Concessionaire and the damages
calculations have been calculated in pesos, the Award should also be denominated in

pesos (Respondent’s Post-Hearing Br., para. 53 at 23).

As to interest, assuming a principal sum expressed in Mexican pesos, the Respondent
submits that interest should be calculated according to the Mexican CETES rates.
However, the Respondent submits that the 28 day rate is “a much more commonly used
economic indicator than the 364 day rate proposed by the Claimants”, thereby satisfying
the requirement for interest at the “applicable market rate” in the Mexico-France BIT
and for a “reasonable commercial rate” in the Argentina BIT (Respondent’s Post-

Hearing Br., para. 54 at 23-24).

The Respondent objects to compound interest in this case, for the following reasons

(Respondent’s Post-Hearing Br. at 24):

“55. Mexico disagrees with the Claimants’ contention that compound interest
should be awarded. While there are examples in the jurisprudence of
awards of compound interest, there are also numerous examples of
awards of simple interest. There is no hard and fast rule.

56. There is no reason to benefit the Claimants with an award of compound
interest where: (i) the conduct of the Claimants (or a person for whom
they are responsible) is the underlying cause of the events giving rise to
the claim; (ii) there was no effort made by the Claimants to cure the
effects of the problem; (iii) it is virtually certain the Claimants’ business
venture would have collapsed had the government not appointed an
administrative intervener; (iv) they were paid dividends and a return of all
variable capital which compensated them, in whole or substantial part, for
the amounts they invested. Presumably since its repayment, that variable

16-18

capital has been put to other uses by each Claimant; it is certainly no
longer invested and at risk in Renave.”

[Footnotes omitted]

The Respondent submits that, in the event of any compensation ordered by the Tribunal,
simple interest at the 28 day CETES rate should be awarded as from the valuation date

(Respondent’s Post-Hearing Br., para 57 at 24).

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

General Approach. As already decided earlier in Part XII of this Award, the Tribunal is
guided generally by the provisions of the two BITs on compensation for lawful
expropriation, as regards the consequences of the Respondent’s breach of the BITs in
regard to the FET standards and unlawful expropriation. For the same reasons, the
Tribunal here decides to be guided generally (inter alia) by the provisions of the BITs as

regards appropriate currency and interest.

Currency: As regards appropriate currency, as cited above, Article 5.4 of the Argentina
BIT provides for payment in a freely-convertible currency assessed as at the date of
valuation; and Article 5.3 of the France BIT provides for the Tribunal to fix the mode of
payment “no later than the date of deprivation”. There is here no mandate requiring the
Tribunal to assess the compensation in Mexican currency as at the date of valuation and
to convert that amount into US$ in the Award, using an exchange rate as at the date of
that Award necessarily long after the date of valuation. There is also no reason to do so
on the facts of this case. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ primary case

on currency.

The Tribunal prefers the approach suggested by the two BITs, namely to convert the
amount of compensation from Mexican currency to US$ at the date of the Tribunal’s
valuation, namely 24 June 2001. Given that the Claimants were foreign investors and

that Mexican currency is historically subject to fluctuation, it would be reasonable to

Part XVI — Page 7

16-19

16-20

16-21

16-22

16-23

assume that the Claimants, if fully compensated by the Respondent on 24 June 2001,
would have required payment in US$ or, if not paid in US$ but in Mexican currency,
that the Claimants would have immediately converted such compensation from Mexican
currency into a reserve currency; and, in all the circumstances of this case, that currency
would have been the currency of the United States of America for both Talsud and (at

least initially) Gemplus.

Accordingly, in these arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal has decided to express its
order for compensation in US currency, converted from Mexican currency as at 24 June

2001 at the exchange rate then prevailing commercially; namely: MXN 9.065 = USS1.

Principal sums: The principal sums of compensation ordered by the Tribunal for
payment by the Respondent to the Claimants under this Award are thus: (i) Gemplus:
USS 4,483,164 (ie. US$ 5,853,417 less relevant deductions of US$ 1,370,253) and (ii)
Talsud: US$ 6,458,721 (i.e. US$ 8,487,455 less relevant deductions of US$ 2,028,734).

Interest: As to starting-date and end-date for interest on the principal sums, the Tribunal
decides that the former shall be 24 June 2001 and the latter the date of full payment by

the Respondent under this Award.

It is however necessary to adjust for the Claimants’ receipts of capital and 50% dividend
in December 2002. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that interest shall run on the
greater sums of US$ 5,853,417 for Gemplus and of US$ 8,487,455 for Talsud from 24
June 2001 to 30 December 2002 (i.e. without deducting these receipts), a period of

almost 18 months.

Both BITS refer to appropriate rates of interest in similar terms, as a reasonable
commercial rate “for that currency” in the Argentina BIT and “applicable” market rate
in the France BIT. The Tribunal considers it generally inappropriate, if not in this case
also fundamentally wrong in principle, to apply any interest rate derived from one
currency to a quite different currency, such as the Mexican and US currencies.
Accordingly, the Tribunal decides not to apply either of the CETES rates advanced by

the Parties to sums expressed in US$.

Part XVI — Page 8

16-24

16-25

16-26

The Tribunal decides that, for these US currency amounts owed by a friendly sovereign
state to investors subject to the protection of two other friendly sovereign states, the
appropriate base rate is the one-month US Treasury Bills annualised rate, as published
by the US Federal Reserve Bank’. That rate was 3.49% in June 2001, falling to 1.19%
in December 2002, rising to 4.96% in August 2006 and currently falling to less than 1%.
Given the different financial status and rating for the two countries, it is necessary to
adjust this base rate upwards to reflect an appropriate rate of interest for a US$ debt
owing by the Respondent, which the Tribunal fixes as an average uplift of 2% for the

period from June 2001 to full payment under this award.

Conscious that this exercise is mathematically inexact and cannot fully replicate in fact
an essentially hypothetical situation, the Tribunal fixes (i) a rate of interest of 4% (i.e.
2% plus 2%) for the period from 24 June 2001 to 30 December 2002; (ii) a rate of
interest of 4.25% (i.e. 2.25% plus 2%) from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2009;
and (iii) a rate of interest of 2% from | January 2010 to full payment by the Respondent

under this Award.

The Parties have expressed diverging views on whether this is an appropriate case for
the application of compound, as opposed to simple, interest. As noted above, the BITs
contain no express provision on compound interest. However the reference to
“commercial” and “market” in Article 5 of these BITS both point to the permissible
application of reasonable compound rates, given that it is the universal practice of banks
and other loan providers in the world market to provide monies at a cost amounting to
or equivalent to compound rates of interest and not simple interest. In addition, it is
clear from the legal materials cited by the Claimants (summarised above, to which
several more could be added) that the current practice of international tribunals
(including ICSID) is to award compound and not simple interest. In the Tribunal’s
opinion, there is now a form of ‘jurisprudence constante’ where the presumption has
shifted from the position a decade or so ago with the result it would now be more

appropriate to order compound interest, unless shown to be inappropriate in favour of

Bank, see: www.federalreserve. gov/realeases/h | 5/data/Monthly/H15_TB_M3.txt

simple interest, rather than vice-versa. As to rest-periods, the Tribunal is content to

accept the Claimants’ submission that these should be yearly rests.

16-27. Accordingly, in the light of the Tribunal’s decisions as to interest, the relevant

arithmetical exercise for interest can be summarised as follows:

(A) First Period 24.06.2001 — 30.12.2002: Almost 18 months

4% compounded (yearly rests) applied to (i) US$ 5,853,417 (Gemplus) and (ii) US$
8,487,455 (Talsud):

US$ 351,205 (Gemplus)
US$ 514,340 (Talsud)
(B) Second Period 31.12.2002 — 31.12.2009: 7 years

4.25% compounded (yearly rests) applied to (i) US$ 4,483,164 (Gemplus) and (ii)
US$ 6,458,721 (Talsud):

US$ 1,516,384 (Gemplus)
US$ 2,184,567 (Talsud)
(C) Third Period 01.01.2010 — Full Payment

2% compounded (yearly rests) applied to (i) US$ 4,483,164 (Gemplus) and (ii) US$
6,458,721 (Talsud):

This calculation will be readily made by the Parties but cannot, of course,

be here made by the Tribunal.

Part XVI — Page 10

(05) THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

16-28 For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides to order in this Award compensation
expressed in the currency of the United States of America converted from Mexican
currency as at 24 June 2001 (being the relevant date for assessing compensation) and to
award compound interest on such compensation (with yearly rests) from 24 June 2001

until full payment by the Respondent to the Claimants.

16-29 In accordance with the rates of interest and principal sums calculated above, the
Tribunal decides that compound interest accrues from 24 June 2001 to 31 December

2009 as follows:
US$ 1,867,589 (Gemplus) (i.e. 351,205 + 1,516,384)
US$ 2,698,907 (Talsud) (i.e. 514,340 + 2,184,567)

Interest on the principal sums of (i) US$ 4,483,164 (Gemplus) and (ii) US$ 6,458,721
(Talsud) shall carry compound interest at 2% (with annual rests) from 1 January 2010

until full payment by the Respondent to the Claimants under this Award.

PART XVII: ISSUE L —- LEGAL AND ARBITRATION COSTS

(01) INTRODUCTION

17-1

17-2

The Tribunal’s power to award costs in these arbitration proceeding derives from

Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, which provides as

follows:

“Article 58

Cost of Proceeding

(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by
whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses
and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that
end, call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with the
information it needs in order to formulate the division of the costs of the
proceeding between the parties.
(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall
form part of the award.”
Upon the conclusion of the main hearing in these proceedings on 27 February 2008, the
Tribunal ordered the Parties to provide written submissions on costs. The date for
providing costs submissions was subsequently extended by the Tribunal at the
supplemental hearing on 28 May 2008, resulting in the Parties’ “June Submissions on
Costs”. The Tribunal further invited the Parties to provide supplemental submissions on
costs, among other matters, by its letters dated 1 and 7 October 2008, resulting in the

Parties’ “October Submissions on Costs”.

Part XVII — Page 1

(02) THE CLAIMANTS’ CASE

17-3

17-4

17-5

The Claimants submit that, in principle, the losing party should pay the reasonable costs
incurred by the successful party, including lawyers’ and other professionals’ fees and
arbitration expenses and disbursements. The Claimants further submit that tribunals
will also consider whether the losing party’s case was presented in an efficient and
professional manner. The Claimants rely on several ICSID and ad hoc arbitral awards in

support of these propositions (Claimants’ June Submission on Costs, paras. 4-15).

Among those cases discussed, the Claimants rely on the tribunal’s award in Azinian,

stating as follows (Claimants’ June Submission on Costs, para. 12):

“12. The first NAFTA tribunal to issue a final award, Azinian, stated the
principle that “[i]n ordinary circumstances it is common in international
arbitral proceedings that a losing claimant is ordered to bear the costs of
the arbitration, as well as to contribute to the prevailing respondent’s
reasonable costs of representation. This practice serves the dual function
of reparation and dissuasion.” In that case, however, the tribunal
concluded that in the special circumstances of the Azinian case the parties
should bear their own costs. The Azinian tribunal set out the basic
principles which it considered a NAFTA tribunal should consider in
deciding the issue of costs. These were (i) the novelty of NAFTA as a
dispute resolution mechanism (this was a particularly relevant factor in
the Azinian case, as it was the first time a NAFTA tribunal issued an []
award and thus considered the issue of costs); (ii) whether the claimants
presented its case in an efficient and professional manner; (iti) whether
the respondent may be said to some extent to have invited litigation; and
(iv) whether the persons most accountable for the claimant's wrongful
behavior would be the least likely to be affected by an award on costs.””

Applying the Azinian criteria, which the Claimants contend are the “strictest articulated
by any investment arbitration tribunal”, the Claimants submit that they are entitled to
their costs if successful in these proceedings, setting forth their reasoning as follows

(Claimant”' June Submission on Costs, paras. 16-22):

“16. [...] As to the first point (novelty), the ICSID Additional Facility was
created in 1978 and is certainly not novel. As to the fourth point
(responsible party not bearing the costs), the illegal measures taken by

Part XVII — Page 2

Mexico were the responsibility of Secofi, the predecessor to the
Secretariat of Economy which represents Mexico in this arbitration. The
responsible party would therefore directly bear the costs of this
arbitration. It is further submitted, that the second (whether the
respondent presented its case efficiently and professionally) and third
(respondent invited litigation) factors support an award on costs in favour
of the Claimants for the following reasons.

On the assumption that they are successful on the merits of their claims,
the Tribunal will have found that the Claimants’ treaty rights were
breached by Mexico. The extreme rigour with which the claims made in
this arbitration have been opposed by the Respondent will have been
apparent to the Tribunal. This left the claimants with little choice but to
bring these proceedings. Pursuant to the third Azinian factor, the
Claimants are therefore entitled to their reasonable costs.

 

The Claimants further submit that they are entitled to their reasonable
costs because the Respondent presented its case inefficiently. Not only
were lengthy arguments made on jurisdiction, which were eventually
abandoned, but an additional hearing had to be held in Washington, DC
to discuss a point that had no bearing on the case. The Claimants submit
that they should recover their costs of addressing the Respondent's flawed
jurisdiction challenge and of the hearing on 28 May 2008 in any event.
This is set out in detail below in Part IV, but the Claimants further rely on
this to support their submission that they should recover their costs if they
are successful on the merits.

The Tribunal should also take account of the fact that the Respondent
raised every argument available to defend the claims including some
which were implausible. [...]

The Respondent submitted a considerable amount of documents together
with their pleadings. A total of 457 electronic documents were submitted
by the Respondent, including dozens of press articles, some of dubious
relevance to the claim, and the DVD of a documentary on Ricardo
Cavallo. Many of these documents were not even referred to in the
pleadings or evidence. The Tribunal will recall the Respondent's
theatrical distribution of Exhibit R-144 on the 6m" day of the hearing,
although it had been referred to in pleadings or witnesses statement
presented by the Respondent. This compares to approximately 235
electronic documents submitted by the Claimants.

Significant costs thus had to be expanded [sic] by the Claimants to
respond to the Respondent's arguments. These were reasonable expenses.
As stated by the ADC Tribunal, itself quoting Sylvania Technical Sys. Inc.
v. Iran:

Part XVII — Page 3

17-6

A test of reasonableness is not, however, an invitation to mere
subjectivity. Objective tests of reasonableness of lawyers’ fees are
well-known. Such tests typically assign weight primarily to the time
spent and complexity of the case. In modern practice, the amount
of time required to be spent is often a gauge of the extent of the
complexity involved. Where the Tribunal is presented with copies
of bills for services or other appropriate evidence, indicating the
time spent, the hourly billing rate, and a general description of the
professional services rendered, its task need be neither onerous
nor mysterious. The range of typical hourly billing rates is
generally known and, as evidence before the Tribunal in various
cases including this one indicates, it does not greatly differ
between the United States and countries of Western Europe, where
both claimants and respondents before the Tribunal typically hire
their outside counsel. Just how much time any lawyer reasonably
needs to accomplish a task can be measured by the number of
issues involved in a case and the amount of evidence requiring
analysis and presentation. While legal fees are not to be calculated
on the basis of the pounds of paper involved, the Tribunal by the
end of a case is able to have a fair idea, on the basis of the
submissions made by both sides, of the approximate extent of the
effort that was reasonably required.

Nor should the Tribunal neglect to consider the reality that legal
bills are usually first submitted to businessmen. The pragmatic fact
that a businessman has agreed to pay a bill, not knowing whether
or not the Tribunal would reimburse the expenses, is a strong
indication that the amount billed was considered reasonable by a
reasonable man spending his own money, or the money of the
corporation he services. That is a classic test of reasonableness.”

22. The reasonableness of the Claimants’ costs is further illustrated by the
size of its legal team compared to that of the Respondent. Whereas four
lawyers appeared on behalf of the two Claimants, Mexico was represented
by four legal teams and 15 lawyers. The Claimants’ legal team at Baker &
McKenzie comprised David Fraser with an average hourly billing rate of
£450, associate Edward Poulton with an average hourly billing rate of
£320 and consultant Alexis Martinez with an average hourly rate of
£130.”

[Footnotes omitted]

In sum, the Claimants claim a total of US$ 5,362,973.22 (US$ 2,314,031.74 on account
of Gemplus and US$ 3,048,941.48 on account of Talsud) (Claimants’ June Submissions

on Costs, para. 24; and Claimants’ October Submissions on Costs, at 1).

Part XVII — Page 4

17-7 The Claimants further argue that, in any event of the cause, the Respondent should bear
“the unjustified costs” they incurred in order to address the Respondent’s jurisdictional

arguments and to attend the supplemental 28 May 2008 hearing.

17-8 As regards costs associated with defence of the jurisdictional arguments, the Claimants
submit that the Respondent’s prosecution of these arguments was unreasonable,
identifying their costs associated with the defence of these arguments in the amount of
US$ 160,443.11 (US$ 139,904.72 on account of Gemplus and US$ 20,538.39 on

account of Talsud) (Claimants’ June Submissions on Costs, paras. 26-28).

17-9 As regards the supplemental hearing of 28 May 2008, the Claimants submit as follows

(Claimants’ June Submission on Costs, para. 29):

“29. In addition, the Respondent produced a declaration from Miguel de Erice
on the penultimate day of the first hearing contradicting a minor factual
statement made by Victor Taiariol. Even though the Claimants made clear
that they placed no reliance on that point, the insistence by the
Respondent that this should be admitted in evidence (and the
unavailability of Mr. de Erice to travel to Washington to give oral
evidence during the three days that remained for the scheduled hearing in
February) made it necessary to convene a new hearing in Washington, DC
at a later stage to confront the witnesses. This was an indulgence granted
to the Respondent. This hearing took place on 28 May 2008 and proved
inconclusive. No issue relevant to the outcome of the dispute was
addressed during the extra hearing day and the Respondent should pay all
costs incurred by the Claimants in preparing for and attending the
hearing.”

[Footnotes omitted]

17-10 On this basis, the Claimants claim their full costs associated with the supplemental
hearing, identifying those costs as totaling US$ 274,687.53 (US$ 129,990.67 on account
of Gemplus and US$ 144,696.86 on account of Talsud).

(03) THE RESPONDENT’S CASE

17-11

17-12

17-13

17-14

17-15

In its June Submissions on Costs, the Respondent claimed total costs in the amount of
US$2,319,841.70, which comprise the costs of external legal counsel, expert fees and
disbursements, witness expenses, administrative expenses and other expenses incurred

in relation to attendance of the hearing (Respondent’s June Submissions on Costs, at 1).

In its supplemental submissions on Costs, the Respondent provided a revised statement
of its actual costs incurred in these proceedings, totaling US$ 2,553,437.68

(Respondent’s October Submissions on Costs, at 2).

The Respondent subsequently provided substantive costs submissions in response to the
Claimants’ arguments in support of a costs award. As a general matter, the Respondent
submits that the Claimants’ submissions are premised upon the assumption that the
measures taken by Mexico were unlawful, as follows (Respondent’s October

Submissions on Costs, at 1):

“The Respondent obviously has a very different view of its response to
various events (particularly its attempt to forge consensus in support of an
affordable motor vehicle registry for used vehicles during July-August
2000 and its responses to the train of events occasioned by the Cavallo
affair). There is a distinct lack of any recognition by the Claimants of their
contribution to the crisis and to the collapse of public confidence in the
entire project.”
The Respondent next contends that its defence of the claims brought against it was
conducted responsibly, rejecting the Claimant’ suggestion that it defended those claims
“with extreme rigour” in the event that this characterization is “intended to suggest that
it did anything other than defend its legal interests vigorously, as it is entitled to do”

(Respondent’s October Submissions on Costs, at 1).

In respect of the Claimants’ submissions on the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections,

the Respondent contends as follows (Respondent’s October Submissions on Costs, at 1):

Part XVII — Page 6

“With respect to the jurisdictional objection mounted against Gemplus, a
careful review of the Gemplus re-organization raises serious questions
about the continuous nationality issue. Reserving in Gemplus
Luxembourg, a non-beneficiary of the France-Mexico treaty, the right to
re-assign possession of the claim parked in SLP, S.A., is objectionable, as
is the attempt by Gemplus Mexico to launch an international claim against
its own State (in the absence of text in the bilateral treaty akin to Article
25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention). Neither objection is, with respect,
complex or convoluted, and both go to the crucial issue of standing to
bring an international claim.

Mexico pressed the objections as far as it could. It will be recalled that the
Tribunal accepted the Claimants’ invocation of privilege and declined to
order them to produce further documents pertaining to the Gemplus re-
organization. Therefore Mexico could not develop the objection any
further. Contrary to the Claimants’ Submission (at paragraph 18), the
objections were not “eventually abandoned,” but rather are maintained.

With respect to the jurisdictional challenge against Talsud, that objection
was withdrawn in Mexico's Rejoinder (at paragraph 128) after additional
evidence was filed in the Reply.”

[Footnotes omitted]

17-16 The Respondent further objects to the Claimants’ characterization of its presentation of
its case as inefficient, submitting in particular with regard to the supplemental hearing

as follows (Respondent’s October Submissions on Costs, at 2):

“As for the holding of the 28 May 2008 hearing, which the Claimants
describe hopefully as having “no bearing on the case” (at paragraph 18)
and Mr. Taiariol’s testimony on his departure from Mexico as “a minor
factual statement” (at paragraph 29), the decision to schedule the hearing
was the Tribunal’s after reading Mr. de Erice’s letter denouncing Mr.
Taiariol’s testimony and entering it into the record. The Respondent does
not view the Tribunal’s treatment of Mr. Taiariol’s testimony as an
“indulgence,” nor does it share the Claimants’ view (at paragraph 29)
that the hearing proved “inconsequential.”

It is recalled that the President made it clear to the Claimants that they
were advised to provide documentary evidence in support of any reply
testimony that they might file in response to Mr. de Erice (although such
documentary evidence as was later provided did not support Mr.
Taiariol’s account of the alleged Taiariol-de Erice-Creel meeting and
subsequent escorted visit to the airport and his own story kept changing).

The Claimants seem to imply that the President and 66% shareholder of a
claimant was free to give false testimony that was later denied by the
claimant's former lawyer and unsupported by Talsud’s other
representative, Mr. Siegrist, so long as (in their view) it was not material
to their case. The Respondent has a very different view. If this is what
claimants are free to do in investment arbitrations, the system will be
short-lived indeed. Moreover, had his story not been denounced by
Talsud’s former counsel, the Respondent believes that the Claimants
would not have been so quick to distance themselves from his testimony on
this point when Mexico applied to adduce the de Erice letter and it would
have played a prominent role in their closing arguments. For those
reasons, the Respondent disagrees that its arguments made in the light of
Mr. Taiariol’s testimony and behaviour were in any way implausible.”
With regard to the relative size of the counsel teams on each side, the Respondent
submits that this factor is irrelevant, contending that the issue is rather the size of the
overall bills from counsel. In this respect, the Respondent submits that the billing rates
for the Claimants’ counsel are excessive and the relative efficiencies of counsel are
demonstrated by the size of the fee accounts (Respondent’s October Submissions on

Costs, at 2).

The Respondent further defended the volume of documents filed by the Respondent in
these proceedings, including the DVD, submitting that it was “crucial that the Tribunal,
two members of which likely had never heard of the Renave project and the events of
August-September 2000 before this case, had as full an understanding of the
circumstances surrounding the Secretariat’s actions as possible” (Respondent’s October

Submissions on Costs, at 3).

In summary, the Respondent submits that whilst the Tribunal may decide this is not a
case in which a successful claimant ought to be subject to a costs award, costs should, at
a minimum, be awarded in the Respondent’s favour in respect of the expenses
occasioned by Mr. Taiariol’s testimony (Respondent’s October Submissions on Costs,

at 3).

(04) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

17-20

17-21

17-22

General Approach. The Tribunal observes that the Claimants have prevailed overall on
jurisdiction, liability, causation and (to a lesser extent) quantum, leading to an Award by
this Tribunal for significant amounts to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimants (i.e.
Gemplus and Talsud). In short, whilst falling short of their pleaded claims, the
Claimants’ case has broadly prevailed in these proceedings; and the Respondent’s case

has not prevailed.

Article 58(1) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules confers a broad
discretion on the Tribunal, as to legal and arbitration costs. Moreover, following the
general principle expressed in Chorzow Factory, that “reparation must, as far as
possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act”, it is the Tribunal’s view that
compensation should include a claimant’s reasonable costs, both reasonably incurred
and reasonable in amount, in successfully and necessarily asserting its disputed legal

rights in arbitration proceedings against an unsuccessful respondent.

This general approach is consistent with the recent practice of other arbitral tribunals in
investment treaty arbitrations (including ICSID), which take as their starting-point the
general principle that the successful party should have its reasonable costs paid by the
unsuccessful party, in accordance with the general position in other forms of
transnational commercial arbitration.! The Tribunal considers the analysis of the so-
called “loser pays principle” in the award International Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v.

Mexico to be particularly apposite to the present case:

“It is also debated whether “the loser pays” (or “costs follow the event”)
rule should be applied in international investment arbitration. It is indeed
true that in many cases, notwithstanding the fact that the investor is not
the prevailing party, the investor is not condemned to pay the costs of the

* See e.g. ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary (ICSID Case No.
ARB/03/16), Award of 2 October 2006, paras, 531-534.

government. The Tribunal fails to grasp the rationale of this view, except
in the case of an investor with limited financial resources where
considerations of access to justice may play a role. Barring that, it
appears to the Tribunal that the same rules should apply to international
investment arbitration as apply in other international arbitration
proceedings.”

17-23 Other Factors: As regards any special factors arising from the facts of this case, the
Tribunal dismisses the Claimants’ criticisms of the Respondent. The latter conducted
itself in these proceedings with propriety and professionalism; and it is no criticism for
the Tribunal here to confirm that the Respondent’s counsel defended the Respondent’s
interests vigorously; indeed that should be understood as a compliment in this case. The
Tribunal likewise rejects any criticism of the Respondent for asserting and then
abandoning its jurisdictional challenge to Talsud’s claims: it was a legitimate challenge
on perceived facts when first raised; and when the full facts emerged, the challenge was
promptly dropped by the Respondent. The Tribunal also rejects the Claimants’
criticisms of the Respondent in regard to the supplemental hearing. The Tribunal found
that further factual evidence more than useful, albeit not for the primary purpose
invoked by the Respondent. Conversely, the Tribunal accepts that the Gemplus
Claimants were reasonable in introducing two additional parties in support of their
alternative case on jurisdiction. Indeed, the addition of these two parties was not

responsible for any significant additional costs by either side.

17-24 In short, this was never an easy, simple or straightforward case; and the Tribunal
records its appreciation to both sides for the responsible conduct and presentation of
their respective cases. Accordingly, in the absence of any special factors, one way or the
other, the Tribunal decides to apply the general principle that the Claimants, as the
successful party, should recover their costs from the Respondent, as the unsuccessful

party.

* International Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v. Mexico, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Award of 26 January 2006, at para.
214. This arbitration tribunal applied the four factors identified by the Azinian tribunal, deciding that the relatively
successful respondent was entitled to recover from the relatively unsuccessful claimant an appropriate portion of its
costs of legal representation and assistance.

Amount of Costs. As noted above, the Claimants claim costs in the total sum of US$
5,362,973.22. This amount significantly exceeds the Respondent’s claim for costs,
being less than 45% of the Claimants’ costs; but the Tribunal does not consider the
latter excessive for this case. It is well-known that legal costs incurred by respondent-
state parties are usually much lower than costs incurred by claimant-private parties,
partly because a claimant bears a greater burden in presenting and proving its case,
partly because a state’s billing practices with its legal representatives are different and
partly, as here, where there is more than one claimant bringing claims under more than
one treaty. The Tribunal also here bears much in mind the point made in the ADC and
Sylvania awards (cited above), as to the “pragmatic fact” that the Claimants’ legal bills
had first to be presented to and paid by the Claimants at a time when the Claimants

could not know whether or not the Tribunal would reimburse the Claimants.

In this case, the Tribunal sees no good reason to second-guess, with the advantage of
hindsight, the Claimants’ amount of costs; and it concludes that their claimed costs for
these proceedings were both reasonably incurred and reasonable in amount rounded
down to US$ 2.3 million for Gemplus and US$ 3 million for Talsud (making US$ 5.3
million in all). The Tribunal adds an amount of US$ 75,000 for each Claimant
corresponding to their respective shares of the last advance requested by the Centre in
January 2010, which had not been included in the Parties’ Submissions on Costs of

2008.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal awards the Claimants their costs in the total
amount of US$ 5,450,000, namely (i) US$ 2.375 million for Gemplus and (ii) US$
3.075 million for Talsud.
