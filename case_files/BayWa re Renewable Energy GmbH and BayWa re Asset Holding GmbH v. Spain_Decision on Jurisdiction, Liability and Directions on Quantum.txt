INTRODUCTION

This case has been submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) under the Energy Charter Treaty, which entered into
force for the Kingdom of Spain and the Federal Republic of Germany on 16 April 1998
(the “ECT”)! and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the

“ICSID Convention’).

It concerns a dispute between two German investors and the Kingdom of Spain arising
out of measures implemented by the Government of Spain modifying the regulatory and

economic regime of renewable energy projects.

THE PARTIES

The Claimants are BayWa r.e. Renewable Energy GmbH (“BayWa RE”)* and BayWa
r.e. Asset Holding GmbH (“BayWa AH”),’ companies incorporated under the laws of
Germany (together, the “Claimants”). The Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain”
or the “Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The

Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

REGISTRATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

On 16 April 2015, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration against Spain (the
“REA”).

On 8 May 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the RfA in accordance with
Article 36.3 of the ICSID Convention and so notified the Parties.

On 9 July 2015, the Parties informed the Centre of their agreement as to the number of
arbitrators and the method for the Tribunal’s constitution. Pursuant to this agreement, the
Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators; one appointed by each Party and the third, the
presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. If no such agreement
could be reached by 7 September 2015, either Party could request the Secretary-General
to appoint the President after consulting both Parties through a ballot procedure. As further
agreed, the presiding arbitrator need not necessarily be selected from the Panel of

Arbitrators.

On 10 July 2015, the Centre invited the Parties to clarify certain aspects of the proposed
ballot procedure. The Claimants and the Respondent provided such clarifications by

communications sent on 15 and 16 July, respectively.

In accordance with the Parties’ agreement, the Claimants appointed Dr. Horacio A.
Grigera Na6n, an Argentine national, on 17 July 2017, and the Respondent appointed

Ms. Loretta Malintoppi, an Italian national, on 27 July 2017, as arbitrators.

On 8 September 2015, the Claimants informed the Centre that no agreement had been
reached. They thus requested the Secretary-General to propose a ballot of possible
candidates as per the Parties’ agreement. On 17 September 2015, the Secretary-General

sent such ballot to the Parties.

On 5 October 2015, the Centre informed the Parties that the ballot procedure had not
resulted in any mutually agreeable candidate, and that the Secretary-General would
proceed with the appointment of the presiding arbitrator pursuant to the default method

agreed by the Parties.

By letter of 28 October 2015, the Secretary-General communicated that she intended to
appoint Judge James R. Crawford and invited the Parties to send their comments, if any,
by 4 November 2015. On 5 November 2015, after not having received any comments, the
Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Centre would proceed with the proposed

appointment of Judge Crawford as President of the Tribunal.

On 6 November 2015, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators
had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been
constituted on that date in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”). Mr. Francisco Grob, ICSID Legal
Counsel, was designated Secretary of the Tribunal. Mr. Grob’s legal and professional

background was communicated to the Parties by a letter sent on 26 May 2015.

THE FIRST SESSION

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with

the Parties on 10 December 2015, by teleconference.

Following the first session, on 29 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. | recording the agreements of the Parties on procedural matters and the decisions of
the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. | provides, inter alia, that the
applicable Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006 and the procedural
languages would be English and Spanish. In addition, Procedural Order No. 1 set out a

schedule for the written and oral proceedings.

Cc. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S FIRST APPLICATION TO INTERVENE

16. On 16 February 2016, the European Commission (“EC”) submitted an Application for
Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party pursuant to Article 37.2 of the ICSID
Arbitration Rules (“EC’s First Application”). The EC sought to intervene on the question

whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction over intra-EU investment disputes under the ECT.

17. Following observations from both Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2
(“PO2”), dated 23 May 2016. The Tribunal found the application premature as the
Respondent had not raised any jurisdictional objections at that point, nor had it filed its

Counter-Memorial. In the Tribunal’s view:

Due to the absence so far of submissions by the Respondent on the
very matter on which the Commission seeks to intervene, the
Tribunal considers that it is not in a position to determine whether
the Commission’s intervention would assist the Tribunal in the
terms of ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2)(a). In the Tribunal’s opinion,
this criterion can only be sensibly assessed after the Respondent has
had the opportunity to address the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (i.e. after
the Counter-Memorial, due on June 15, 2016).4

18. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejected the EC’s First Application without prejudice to a
further application by the EC following the filing of the Counter-Memorial.

D. THE PARTIES’ FIRST ROUND OF WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS

19. On 3 March 2016, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits (“Cl. Mem.”)
accompanied by the witness statements of Mr. José Alberto Cefia Lazaro, Mr. Andreas
Helber, Mr. Errol G. Schulz (“CWS-ES”), and Mr. Matthias Taft (““CWS-MT”), and by
KPMG’s First Expert Witness Report (“KPMG First Regulatory Report”) and Damages
Expert Report (“KPMG First Damages Report”).

On 15 June 2016, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial
on Jurisdiction (“Resp. C-Mem.”), accompanied by the witness statement of Mr. Juan

Ramon Ayuso and Econ One’s Expert Report (“Econ One First Report”).

DOCUMENT PRODUCTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OF NEW DOCUMENTS

On 12 September 2016, each Party filed a document production application as per Section

15.2.5 of Procedural Order No. 1.

On 3 October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the Parties’

document production applications.

On 18 November 2016, the Respondent requested permission to introduce the final award
rendered on 17 July 2016, in the case Jsolux Netherlands, B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain, SCC
Case V2013/153 (the “Isolux v. Spain (Award)”).

Following the Tribunal’s invitation, the Claimants filed their observations on 2 December
2016. They objected to Respondent’s application, contending that it was inconsistent with
Respondent’s refusal to produce other ECT decisions and awards during document
production and also with the Tribunal’s conclusion that such rulings were not relevant or
material to this case. In addition, the Respondent would breach the presumed
confidentiality of the /solux arbitration proceeding if it was allowed to introduce that

award without the consent of the Claimants in that case, Isolux Netherlands BV.

On 21 December 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the
Respondent’s 18 November application. It held that it is not for it to decide whether the
Respondent should or should not submit a certain authority in support of its case; as a
general rule, no prior leave of the Tribunal is required for submitting an authority with
scheduled pleadings provided that the applicable rules of procedure are otherwise met.
Nor is it for the Tribunal to enforce alleged confidentiality obligations involving a non-

party to the proceeding:

Without prejudice to the discretion of this Tribunal to decline
ordering production of a confidential document or otherwise
exclude from the file information that is to be kept confidential
between the parties, it is generally for the person by whom such
confidentiality is owed to seek any necessary consent to the release
of protected information and for the person to whom such
confidentiality is owed to ensure that such information is not
improperly released and to seek appropriate remedies if need be.

26. The Tribunal therefore denied the Respondent’s application, without prejudice to the right
of either Party in the course of pleadings to cite decisions on file or in the public domain
which they judge to be relevant to this case, and the right of the other Party to respond

thereto.°

5 Procedural Order No. 4, para. 5.

© In the end, the /solux award was tendered with the Rejoinder without objection, and was discussed by the Parties in
oral argument. RL-0088. The award of 4 May 2017, in Eiser Infrastructure Limited and Energia Solar Luxembourg
S.a rl. v. Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/36 (hereinafter “Eiser v. Spain (Award)”), was submitted by

In the meantime, on 13 December 2016, the Claimants filed an application by which they
challenged the Respondent’s compliance with Procedural Order No. 3. The Claimants
asserted that the Respondent had failed to conduct proper searches for, or to produce

complete copies of, documents which the Tribunal ordered be produced.”

By invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent filed comments on Claimants’ application

on 20 December 2016.

On 23 January 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the
Claimants’ 13 December application. Among others, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent
to produce the requested documents concerning the work performed by Roland Berger
(“RB”) and Boston Consulting Group (“BCG”) for the Respondent as well as those
relating to Invest in Spain’s engagement of German international business development

agency, AHP Gruppe.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S SECOND APPLICATION TO INTERVENE

On 17 January 2017, the EC submitted a Second Application for Leave to Intervene as a
Non-Disputing Party pursuant to Article 37.2 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules
(“EC’s Second Application”).

After receiving observations from the Parties, the Tribunal issued, on 4 April 2017,
Procedural Order. No. 6, by which it rejected the EC’s Second Application (“PO6”). The
Tribunal was not convinced that a submission by the EC would add to the sum total of

available information as to intra-EU jurisdiction under the ECT in the terms of Rule

31 May 2019 (hereinafter “NextEra v. Spain (Award)”), RL-0122, 9REN Holding S.d.r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain,
ICSID Case No. ARB/15/15, Award, 31 May 2019 (hereinafter “9REN v. Spain (Award)”), RL-0123.

7 These documents concerned, among others, presentations made by Spanish authorities regarding the Spanish legal
framework for renewable energy; Invest in Spain’s engagement of German international business development
agency, AHP Gruppe; and work performed by Roland Berger and Boston Consulting Group for the Respondent in
relation to MO IET/1045/2014.

37(2)(a), while it would most likely cause additional costs to the Parties. In the Tribunal’s
view:

[...] A non-disputing party permitted to file a submission under that

Rule does not thereby become a party to the proceedings, and the

Tribunal has no jurisdiction to award costs against it. No doubt

permission to file might be made subject to a prior condition of the

provision of security for costs, but the Tribunal understands that the

Commission, faced with such a condition, has declined to file or to
provide security.*

[...] The questions [on which the EC seeks to intervene] have been
extensively discussed in a number of published awards, and have
been well ventilated in the literature. The parties in the present case
are fully capable of presenting the legal issues at stake. ’

THE PARTIES’ SECOND ROUND OF WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS

The Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction
(“Cl. Reply”) on 6 February 2017, accompanied by the second witness statement of Mr.
José Alberto Cefia Lazaro and KPMG’s Rebuttal Expert Witness Report
(“KPMG Second Regulatory Report”) and Complementary Report on Damages
(“KPMG Second Damages Report”)

The Respondent filed a Reply on Jurisdictional Objections and a Rejoinder on the Merits
(“Resp. Rej.”) on 7 April 2017, accompanied by the witness statement of Mr. Daniel
Lacalle and the second witness statement of Mr. Juan Ramoén Ayuso (“RWS-JRA2”), and

by Econ One’s Second Expert Report (“Econ One Second Report”).

On 24 May 2017, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“Cl. Rej.”).

PRE-HEARING PROCEDURES

As scheduled, each Party notified the Tribunal of the witnesses and experts it wished to

call for cross-examination on 13 September 2017.

Pursuant to Section 19.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, a pre-hearing conference call was

held on 5 October 2017, between the President of the Tribunal and the Parties.

Following the pre-hearing conference call, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7,
dated 10 October 2017. This Order reflects the Parties’ agreements and the Tribunal’s

decisions on other issues pertaining to the organization of the hearing.

On 23 October 2017, the Parties informed that they couriered to the Secretary of the
Tribunal five USB drives with a joint electronic bundle containing a full hyperlinked copy
of the case file. The USB drives included new documents and translations agreed by the
Parties to be incorporated into the record per Section 25 of Procedural Order No. 7, as

well as updated lists of factual exhibits and legal authorities.

On 25 October 2017, the Claimants sent a letter to the Tribunal seeking to clarify their
prayer for relief in respect of the tax treatment of the claim for damages, a request to which
the Respondent objected by a letter of 30 October. On 1 November the Claimants
responded and, on 3 November the Respondent replied. The Parties were informed that
the Tribunal would hear them on this issue at the hearing and would then rule on it by a

communication sent on 5 November.

FirST HEARING ON JURISDICTION AND THE MERITS

A first hearing on Jurisdiction and the Merits was held at the ICC hearing facilities in Paris

The Tribunal ruled during the hearing on the Claimants’ request to clarify their prayer for
relief. It stated “[...] we do not regard the Claimants’ letter as an additional or responsive
document within the meaning of section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, nor do we regard

the request for clarification as a modification of the petitum.”'°

The request was therefore noted and the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would

consider the substantive questions associated to it, if any, as they arise.

PosT-HEARING PROCEDURES

On 23 November 2017, the Respondent requested leave to submit into the record a
decision issued by the European Commission on the Spanish State Aid Framework for
Renewable Resources. Following an exchange between the Parties, the Tribunal
authorized the Respondent to submit this document and set a schedule for the Parties to

comment on it.

On 13 December 2017, the Parties submitted their agreed corrections to the November

Hearing’s transcripts, which the Tribunal approved by letter dated 13 January 2018.

On 12 January 2018, the Respondent filed its comments on the European Commission’s

State Aid Decision, which were followed by Claimants’ comments on 29 January 2018.

On 13 February 2018, the Respondent requested permission to submit the award rendered

in JSW Solar v. Czech Republic. Upon the Tribunal’s invitation, the Claimants responded

on 21 February 2018. They accepted the introduction of the JSW Solar award provided
that the dissenting opinion attached thereto by arbitrator Gary Born was also added to the
record. Additionally, they requested that the award in Novenergia II v. Spain be produced
by the Respondent. They did not believe that further submissions concerning these

decisions were necessary.
On 7 March 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties as follows:

Since the hearing last year, a number of developments have
occurred. On November 10, 2017, the European Commission issued
its decision on State aid, which is now part of the record (RL-0117).
In February 2018, the awards in JSW Solar vs. The Czech Republic
(PCA Case No. 2014-03) and Novenergia II v. the Kingdom of
Spain (SCC Case No. V 063/2015) became public. The Respondent
has applied to introduce the first of these decisions and the
Claimants the second. Moreover, [yesterday] the Court of Justice of
the European Union (CJEU) issued its decision in the proceeding of
Slowakische Republik (Slovak Republic) v. Achmea BV, Case C
284/16, which has been referred to in both parties’ pleadings (e.g.
Resp. Rej. Jur., paras 36-38; Cl. Rej. Jur., paras 38 and 51; exhibits
CL-143 & CL-220).

Without prejudice to any final decision, the Tribunal considers
appropriate to be informed of these developments, and have the
Parties’ views in relation thereto, while still in session. The Tribunal
is therefore prepared to admit the aforementioned decisions not yet
in the record.

In addition, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment, both orally and in writing, on (1)
the implications (if any) of the CJEU decision for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the
ECT; (2) the relevance (if any) of the recent investment treaty decisions; and (3) the
implications (if any) of the European Commission’s State Aid Decision for jurisdiction

and merits. A subsequent schedule and hearing were set.

On 4 May 2018, the Parties submitted their comments on the three points referred to in

the previous paragraph.

51.

52.

54.

55.

On 23 October 2018, the Tribunal invited comments on two recent jurisdictional decisions
potentially relevant to the Achmea issue.'! The Parties provided their comments on 13

November 2018.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S PROPOSAL OF 16 MAY 2018

On 16 May 2018, the EC wrote “to inform the Tribunal that in case the Tribunal would
deem that useful for its deliberations, the Commission would still be available to present
written observations or attend any hearing, in the light of the recent judgment of the
European Court of Justice in Case C-284/16 Achmea v. Slovak Republic, and in particular
to set out its view on the consequences of that judgment for pending arbitration cases

based on the Energy Charter Treaty”.

On 18 May 2018, each Party filed observations on the EC’s proposal. The Respondent

urged the Tribunal to let the EC intervene. The Claimants objected to it.

On 29 May 2018, the Tribunal rejected the EC’s proposal. It considered the Parties’ further
pleadings and oral arguments sufficient to inform the Tribunal of the EU law issue that

relate to the claims and positions of the Parties in this proceeding.

SECOND HEARING ON JURISDICTION AND THE MERITS

A second hearing was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague from 22 to 23 May 2018 (the
“May 2018 Hearing”). The following persons were present at the May 2018 Hearing:

The Parties filed their submissions on costs on 2 July 2018.

On 28 January 2019, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to introduce as an additional
legal authority a Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member
States of 15 January 2019, on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of
Justice in Achmea and on Investment Protection in the European Union. The declaration
was signed by 22 EU Members. By invitation of the Tribunal, the Claimants filed their
response on 6 February 2019, opposing the production. The Tribunal issued its decision
on 6 February 2019, stating that pursuant to Section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. 1, no
exceptional circumstances existed to admit the proposed document at an advanced stage

of the proceedings. It therefore denied the request.

By letters of 17 May and 5 June 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on five
new decisions that had come into the public domain.'? These, and several subsequent

cases, are analysed below.

"2 The decisions were: Antaris v. Czech Republic (Award), CL-0243/RL-O117; Greentech v. Spain (Final Award),
CL-0238/RL-0118; REEFF v. Spain (Decision), CL-0239/RL-0119; NextEra v. Spain (Decision), CL-0240/RL-

FACTUAL BACKGROUND®

THE INVESTORS

The Claimants are two German companies, BayWa RE and BayWa AH. BayWa RE owns
100% of the shares in BayWa AH. BayWa RE, in turn, is a wholly owned subsidiary of
BayWa AG (“BayWa AG”), a related company incorporated under the laws of Germany,

which is not, however, a Claimant in this proceeding.

Between 2009 and 2012, BayWa RE acquired the total capital of Renerco Renewable
Energy Concepts AG (““Renerco”).

Renerco at the time held shares and other interests in the projects at stake in this
arbitration. Following this acquisition, Renerco changed its name to BayWa AH on 27

March 2013, and its legal corporate form to a German limited liability company (GmbH).

THE CLAIMANTS’ INVESTMENTS

The Claimants hold shares and participative loans in two companies incorporated in Spain,
Parque E6lico La Carracha, S.L. and Parque Edlico Plana de Jarreta, S.L. (collectively the
“SPVs”). These companies own and manage two wind farms with an installed capacity of
about 49 MWs each, located in La Muela, province of Zaragoza, Spain: La Carracha and

Plana de Jarreta (the “Wind Farms” or the “Projects”).

'3 There are several English translations of the same documents in the record. For quotations, the Tribunal uses the
translations that it has deemed more accurate. Reference is made to the translation’s source in each case.

The Wind Farms were developed in 1997 by a German company, Thyssen Rheinstahl

      

Technik GmbH in cooperation with a Danish wind turbine manufacturer.

In 1999, Thyssen along with other four firms sponsoring the Projects incorporated in
Germany a company named PDF Project Development Fund GmbH & Co. KG (“PDF
Project Development”). On 11 March 1999 PDF Project Development formed the SPVs

in Spain, whose purpose was to run the Wind Farms.

The Wind Farms were provisionally registered in the Registro administrativo de
instalaciones de produccién en régimen especial (“RAIPRE”) on 28 June 1999,'4
Pursuant to the applicable regulations, they were authorized to benefit from the Special
Regime set out in RD 2818/1998 subject to the execution of the Projects and the

completion of final registration in the RAIPRE.

On 28 December 2001, the main participants to the Projects at the time entered into a

financing agreement (“Framework Agreement for the investment in the Wind

Farms”).!> The Wind Farms were to be financed with a ratio of approximately 25%
capital and 75% debt. The capital was provided by the participants / investors using a
combination of equity and subordinated loans. A syndicate of banks provided the bank

financing.

de Aragon attested their Final Registration at the RAIPRE, with effect as of 22 November
2002, through Certificates issued on 26 March 2003.'7 Around the same dates the Wind

Farms started commercial operation.

68. On 28 July 2003, PDF Project Development, then an indirect shareholder to the Projects,
and two other German companies including another shareholder merged to create Renerco
(subsequently renamed BayWa AH).'* Renerco was incorporated in Germany on 7
November 2003. From the date of its inception up until 2009, it owned approximately a

32.6% interest in the SPVs, inheriting the project portfolio of its founding parents.

69. On 30 June 2006, the Projects’ owners agreed with the lenders to refinance the debt.!? The
Projects distributed nearly EUR 17.3 million to shareholders. The funds were distributed

in the form of dividends, reduction in share capital, and principal payments on shareholder

THE DECISION TO INVEST IN SPAIN

BayWa RE made a first offer for Babcock’s shares in Renerco in August 2009. The
Claimants state that this offer was based on an analysis and presentation made by the
financial firm Goetzpartners Corporate Finance Gmbh, which reviewed the project (then
called “Nova” or “Nova Group”) and suggested “a conservative valuation at the lower end
of the range of €42 million to €45 million as the purchase price for an 88% share [...]”.2°

The presentation points to “[c]hanges in legal conditions” as “[p]ossible [r]isks”, affecting

Renerco’s business segment of “[p]roject development”, a risk that was considered
“[TmJedium to high”. With respect to the “[p]ower generation” segment, the presentation
states that “[f]ixed compensation models (such as the Renewable Energies Act) contribute
significantly” to business planning.*” For Respondent, this shows that Claimants knew
about the risk of legal changes.*! Claimants contend that such risk concerned the project
development segment of Renerco’s business; however, La Muela had been developed
more than six years before and should be considered as falling within the power generation

segment. The presentation made no reference to state aid issues.

Following this offer, BayWa RE was given access to two due diligence reports, both
commissioned by the vendor: (i) Vendor Due Diligence Report, dated 4 September 2009,
prepared by the Munich based law firm Stock Aders + Partners Rechtsanwiilte,*? which
included a legal report prepared by the Madrid law firm Bemm & Asociados concerning
the projects in Spain (“Bemm Report”);** and (ii) Vendor Due Diligence Report, dated 8
September 2009, prepared by KPMG AG.* The KPMG report contains mostly financial
information on Renerco’s renewable energy operations in Europe. The Bemm Report is
more specific. It is introduced as a “limited legal vendor due diligence”, which concerns
Renerco’s wind farms in Spain, La Carracha and Plana de Jarreta. It contains a detailed
overview of the Spanish “legal framework for the constructions and operation of onshore
wind farms” as well as analyses of various other legal issues such as corporate structure,
permits and licenses, sale of energy, financing agreements, land use regulations, among

others. Regarding the regulatory framework, it states:

Renewable energies have undergone several modifications of its
legal framework. However, as per today, the applicable rules are
essentially contained in Royal Decree No. 661/2007 as of

comply with the relevant provisions may apply for recognition of
the status of the ‘Special Regime’ which entitles the beneficiary and
owner of such power plants to (i) feed in to the grid and sell the
entire energy production of such plants and (ii) to obtain the benefits

77. In September 2009, Renerco made a presentation in Munich with the purpose of
introducing the company to BayWa AG.*’ The presentation contained information about

Renerco’s portfolio of European assets, including the Wind Farms.

contemplated acquisition of the Babcock’s shares in Renerco. The report states:

In general terms, we have reviewed all the documentation within the
VDR concerning the compliance with regulatory and environmental
law. Except as further explained below, we have not detected any
substantial contingency that could affect the Transaction.*°

On 8 October 2009, BayWa RE proposed the acquisition of Renerco’s shares to the
Management Board of BayWa AG. At the time, it reported that “[i]n the course of due
diligence, no issues were identified that would preclude the potential purchase of the Nova
Group”.! Its business model was considered of “low to medium” risk based on two
considerations: “Readily foreseeable and uniform business performance based on fixed
feed-in fees [and] Feed-in fees for existing projects guaranteed for 20 years.”4? The
presentation points to a “[c]hange in the legal environment (e.g. feed-in fee for future
projects)” as one of the “[s]pecific project risks”.*? Profitability was assessed in “about >
7% to 9% for equity capital”.4 On 3 November 2009, BayWa AG approved the
acquisition of 87.8% of Renerco for EUR 50 million.

On 1 April 2011, Renerco — already under BayWa’s control — considered the acquisition
of a controlling stake in the Wind Farms. An internal document remarked at the time that

“Tt]he regulatory framework for renewable energies in Spain [had] experienced significant

On 8 September 2011, Renerco acquired Shell’s stake in the Wind Farms, becoming the

THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK AND ITS EVOLUTION
wD Basic features

The Spanish legal system has a hierarchical structure. The Constitution is the supreme
law. Subordinate to the Constitution are laws enacted by Parliament. Royal Decree Laws
are measures promulgated by the Government to cope with emergency situations which
have immediate effect but require parliamentary ratification. Royal Decrees are executive
acts promulgated by Ministries in the exercise of regulatory powers. They are
implemented by Ministerial Orders and Resolutions. Supreme Court case law

complements this normative regime.**

As a Member of the European Union, Spain is bound by the EU treaties (notably the
TFEU), EU regulations, directives and decisions. Regulations are generally self-executing
and do not require implementing measures. Directives require Member States to achieve
a specific result although without dictating the means to achieve such result. Decisions

are binding upon the parties to which they are addressed.

Other interpretative tools relied upon by the parties in respect of the application of Spanish
law include preambles of legal statutes (also referred to as explanatory statements);
Renewable Energy Plans and press releases issued by the Council of Ministers; financial

and regulatory dossiers of impact reports on draft decrees; additional reports of and studies

prepared by various authorities such as the Ministry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, since
2011 renamed as Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism (the “Ministry of Energy”),
the Secretary of State for Energy, the National Energy Commission (““CNE”), since 2013
the National Markets and Competition Commission (“CNMC”), and the Instituto para la
Diversificacion y Ahorro de la Energia (Institute for Diversification and Saving of Energy
or “IDAE”). Reference has also been made to presentations made by some of these
authorities, particularly CNE and IDAE officers, and employees of the Spanish agency

“Invest in Spain”.

(2) State actors

The Council of Ministers is an administrative body that comprises the President, the Prime
Minister and individual ministers. Among other things, the Council enacts royal decrees.
The Ministry of Energy is responsible for the Government’s policies on electricity and
regulation of energy matters. It proposes royal decrees to the Council of Ministers and
approves the Ministerial Orders that implement energy legislation. It is divided into
Secretariats, one of which is the Secretariat of Energy presided over by the State Secretary
of Energy. Subordinated to the Secretariat of Energy is IDAE, which contributes to the
definition of the energy policy, advises on technical and economic issues and prepares
national renewable energy plans. It also liaises with the industry. The President of IDAE
is the State Secretary for Energy. “Invest in Spain”, on the other hand, is a public agency
dependent on the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness, which promotes foreign
investments in Spain. Finally, the CNE, replaced later by the CNMC, advises the
Government on energy matters. It issues non-binding reports and opinions on proposed

legislative measures concerning energy regulation.

(3) Law 54/1997

In 1997 Spain liberalized its electricity market, enacting Law 54/1997 on the Electricity

Sector (“Law 54/1997”). The promotion of renewable energy production was one of the

24

objectives of the new legal framework which included specific renewable energy targets.*”
This was in line with international commitments adopted by Spain at the time (and later)
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the share of renewable energy sources.

These included the Kyoto Protocol and multiple EU directives. *

87. Power generation activities were organized in two separate regimes: ordinary and special.
The “Ordinary Regime” applied to conventional generation facilities using non-renewable
energy sources. They were required to sell their electricity output in the wholesale market
for electricity at market price (also known as “pool price”). The “Special Regime”, by
contrast, applied to qualifying electricity generators using renewable sources of energy
such as wind with an installed capacity of less than 50 MW like the Claimants’ Wind
Farms.*? Special Regime facilities were entitled to remuneration in the form of market
price and “where applicable” a supplementary premium for the electricity delivered into
the grid.” Remunerations for the electricity market participants were to be set against

tariff rates, prices, transportation and distribution charges.>!

47 Law 54/1997, Preamble, C-0032. See also Law 54/1997, Sixteenth Transitional Provision (“So that by 2010,
renewable energy sources cover at least the 12% of total energy demand in Spain, a Promotion Plan of renewable
energy sources shall be established to take account of the setting of premiums.”).

48 Communication from the Commission. ‘Energy for the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy’, White Paper for a
Community Strategy and Action Plan. COM (97)599 final, 26 November 1997, C-0031 (setting out an Action Plan
to promote RES sources “directed towards the goal of achieving a 12% penetration of renewables in the Union by
2010”). See also: Directive 2001/77/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 27 September 2001, on
the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market, RL-0015 (“all
Member States [...] to set national indicative targets for the consumption of electricity produced from renewable
sources” - Spain’s specific indicative target was to reach 29.4% of its overall consumption coming from renewables
by 2010); and Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, of 23 April 2009 on the
promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently repealing Directives
2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC .Target 20-20-20, RL-0017.

electric power shall be remunerated economically in the manner provided by this Act, as charged to the rates and
prices paid”).

 

  

 

 

25

88. To qualify for either regime, enrolment in an administrative registry (known as RAIPRE
for its Spanish acronym) was required.>* Although the definition of the specific financial
incentives under the Special Regime was left to implementing regulations, Law 54/1997
directed the Government to take into account factors such as voltage level, environmental
contribution, energy efficiency and investment costs so as “to achieve reasonable
profitability rates with reference to the cost of money on capital markets”.>* Special
Regime producers were also given priority of access to distribution and transmission

networks.*4

(4) RD 2818/1998

89. On 23 December 1998, Spain adopted Royal Decree 2818/1998 (“RD 2818/1998”), which
introduced a feed-in scheme in the form of two incentive remunerations into the general
framework of Law 54/1997. This regime and its incentives applied to renewable energy
facilities including wind energy installations.*> The Wind Farms at issue in this arbitration

were constructed and commissioned under this royal decree. Key features of it include:

(i) Owners of registered installations could choose between selling their electricity to
distributors in exchange for a feed-in tariff for each kWh produced (Article 28.3), or
on the wholesale market and receive a feed-in premium on top of the market price

(Articles 23, 28 and 28.3);°

» Articles 21.4 and 31, Law 54/1997, R-0079.

°3 “The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation installations operating under the special regime
shall be supplemented by the payment of a premium under statutory terms set out in regulations and in the following
cases:[...] To work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the power to the network, the effective
contribution to environmental improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, the generation of
economically justifiable useful heat and the investment costs incurred shall all be taken into account [...]” Article
30.4 of Law 54/1997, R-0079.

* Article 30.2, Law 54/1997, R-0079.

° Article 2.1.b of RD 2818/1998 included under “Group b.2.” those installations “that only use wind power as their
primary energy source.” C-0026.

°© Article 23 provided that owners of installations under 50 MW, with final registration in the RAIPRE, were “not
required to submit offers to the wholesale market” and were entitled to “sell their surplus or, if applicable, their
electrical production, to distributors at the final average market price for electric power, plus any premiums or

26

(ii) Premiums and tariffs were to be updated each year by the Ministry of Energy
considering the evolution of an index, i.e. the average electricity market price

(Article 28.2);

(iii) Premiums would be revised every four years considering the evolution of electricity
market price, the installations’ demand coverage and the effect on the management

of the Electricity System as a whole (Article 32);
(iv) No time limit was set for the application of premiums or tariffs;>”

(v) A transitional period was established for existing facilities to join the new regime

(first transitory provision).

90. In addition, RD 2818/1998 provided for a supplement or penalty, depending on the
circumstances, for reactive energy (“Supplement for Reactive Energy”). This is a bonus
(or discount) applied to revenue from the sale of energy for maintaining (or failing to
maintain) certain power factors on an hourly basis, which are required for the proper
functioning of the electricity system. This supplement/penalty applied under RD

2818/1998 and subsequent royal decrees irrespective of the selected remuneration scheme.

91. In accordance with the sixteenth transitory provision of Law 54/1997, the Spanish
Government approved in December 1999 a Plan de Fomento de las Energias Renovables
en Espafia 2000-2010 (“2000 Renewable Energy Plan”). This Plan laid out the

Government’s policy to attain the renewable energy target of 12% by year 2010, as set by

incentives based on the amounts indicated in this chapter.” Article 28 established the premiums for each Group,
establishing a premium of 5.26 pesetas/kWh for wind installations under 50 MW, included in Group b.2. Article
28.3 provided that wind installations in Group b.2 could choose “not to apply the premiums [...] and to apply a total
price at all hours of [...] 11.02 pesetas/kWh.” RD 2818/1998 introduced a basic feed-in system that guaranteed wind
installations under 50 MW a FiP of 5.26 pesetas/kWh and a FiT of 11.02 pesetas/kWh with “no time limit”.

57 Preamble, Royal Decree 2818/1998, C-0026 (“For facilities based on renewable energies and recycling waste, the
incentive established herein has no time limit due to the need to internalize their environmental benehits, and because,
given their special characteristics and level of technology, their higher costs make it impossible for them to compete
in a free market”).

the European Union.** As far as wind energy is concerned, no change was considered

necessary, on the basis that their “economic profitability is assured by merely maintaining

the current policy on premiums for electricity production”.*?

The Plan makes reference to a “[s]tandard project profitability: calculated on the basis of

maintaining an Internal Rate of Return (IRR), measured in current pesetas and for each
standard project, at a minimum of 7%, with own capital, before financing and after tax”.©°
Reference is also made to a projected annual increase of the electricity demand of around
2%, a lifetime of wind power facilities like the Claimants’ Wind Farms of 20 years and
an estimate of 2,400 of operating hours a year.°! The Plan explains the methodology used

as follows:

Taking as a baseline the proposed energy targets, the financing
requirements have been determined for each technology according
to its profitability, defining a range of standard projects for the
calculation model. These standard projects have been characterised
by technical parameters relating to their size, equivalent operating
hours, unit costs, periods of implementation, lifespan, operating and
maintenance costs and sale prices per final unit of energy. Similarly,
some financing assumptions have been applied, as well as a series
of measures or financial aid.

(5) RD 436/2004

On 1 January 2003, Spain put into effect RD 1432/2002, of 27 December. This regulation
established a new methodology to calculate the average or reference electricity tariff
(“Tarifa Eléctrica Media” or “TMR”), one of the inputs to determine the remuneration
of renewable energy installations. The TMR would be set by the Government annually
and published in advance based on estimated costs needed to remunerate projected

electricity supply and consumer demand.

On 22 January 2004, the CNE issued a report on a draft that later became Royal Decree

436/2004. Among others, the report states:

Production facilities included under the special regime hold the right
to receive a determined compensation for any energy sold, but
logically only hold the acquired right to receive such compensation
concerning the energy already sold, but not in regard to the energy
that is projected to be sold in the future, which solely constitutes an
expectation.

In respect of project financing, the economic memorandum of RD 436/2004 prepared by

the Ministry of Energy states that:

[...] in all cases, 100% of the financing is assumed to have been
through equity capital. Leveraging and the percentage between
equity capital and external funds are decisions specific to each
project and each promoter. If made wisely, they should provide
better ratios than those estimated here.

On 12 March 2004, Spain enacted Royal Decree 436/2004 (“RD 436/2004”), which
adapted the Feed-in system to the new TMR methodology, thereby superseding RD
2818/1998. Its preamble states that this new regulation should serve to accomplish the
objectives set out in the 2000 Renewable Energy Plan, by providing “security and

stability” and establish a “long-lasting, objective and transparent regulatory framework”

© CNE Report 4/2004 of 22 January 2004 on the proposed RD 436/2004, p. 42, R-0126.

in order to foster investment in renewable energy projects. RD 436/2004 gave wind

producers the right to choose, on an annual basis, between:

(i) a fixed tariff calculated now as a specific percentage of the TMR, defined as a
single flat rate and, where applicable, a Supplement for Reactive Energy (“Fixed

Tariff” or “Regulated Tariff”).

(ii) the pool price plus a premium and an incentive for participating in the market

(“Premium Option”)® and, where applicable, a Supplement for Reactive Energy.

Premium, incentive and supplement were all calculated by reference to the TMR

as a fixed percentage.

97. Under both options producers could sell the full net amount of energy generated although
the TMR’s specific percentages of the fixed tariff decreased progressively after the 5"

year of operation and therewith the installation’s remuneration (Article 34, sub.b.2.1)°

98. Under Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004, remuneration revisions would be prospective only
taking into account costs, degree of implementation of each technology and the

correspondent economic impact on the system. Article 40.3 reads:

The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from
any of the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to
the facilities that commence operations subsequent to the date of the

65 Unlike the Fixed Tariff, the Pool Price plus Premium and Incentive option involved market risk because part of
the remuneration came from the wholesale price of electricity. An incentive (on top of the premium) was therefore
offered to account for that risk and make this option more attractive. See RD 436/2004, Preamble, C-0027, (“incentive
for participation in the market as it considers that it thus achieves less administrative involvement in setting electricity
prices, as well as a greater and more efficient allocation of the system’s costs, especially with regard to managing
deviations and the provision of supplementary services.”)

6 For onshore wind farms exceeding 5MW of installed capacity (like the Wind Farms), Fixed Tariff was established
as (i) 90% of TMR for their first 5 years of operation, (ii) 85% of TMR from year 6 to year 15 of operation, and (iii)
80% of TMR from year 16 of operation onwards for the entire lifespan of the wind farm.

effective retroactively on any previous tariffs and premiums.”

This is one of the provisions relied on by the Claimants as a purported grandparent clause.

It is discussed below.

Finally, installations subject to RD 2818/1998, which had already obtained final
registration in the RAIPRE, were granted a transitional period during which they could
choose between remaining subject to RD 2818/1998 for a limited time, or switching to
RD 436/2004 immediately. An alleged amendment to this and other provisions of RD
436/2004 prompted an appeal which was decided by the Spanish Supreme Court in a
judgment rendered on 25 October 2006.”

The new regulation was criticized by some renewable energy producers. In April 2004,
the Asociacién de Productores de Energias Renovables (“APPA”) made a presentation in
which it discussed RD 436/2004. Among the “negative aspects” of the new regulation,
APPA pointed out to its ‘retroactivity’ because of “[dJeadlines starting from

‘commissioning’ instead of after the date of entry into force of the decree.””°

Around the same time, on 24 May 2005, IDAE prepared an informative brochure called
“The Sun Can Be Yours”. This brochure outlined key features of the Spanish regulatory
framework for PV technology. Reference is made to an internal rate of return (“IRR”)

between 5.5% and 13.5%, depending on the type of PV installation, although the brochure

103. On 30 September 2005, the Wind Farms elected to sell their net electricity output under
the Pool Price plus Premium and Incentive option of RD 436/2004, with the option to
switch on an annual basis and receive the Supplement for Reactive Energy. With respect

to this Supplement, the Wind Farms remained under RD 2818/1998 until January 2007.

104. On 26 August 2005, Spain’s Council of Ministers approved the Plan de Energias
Renovables en Espafia 2005-2010 (“2005-2010 Renewable Promotion Plan”). The new
plan reassessed the standing of renewable energies in Spain, including the costs involved
in their support. No change to the remuneration regime was deemed necessary to achieve
the targets set in the 2000-2010 Renewable Energy Plan for wind energy,”* which by then
had reached 91% of the capacity set for 2010 under the 2000 Renewable Energy Plan.”
A more ambitious target for wind power was established instead.”> Calculations were, as

in the 2000 Renewable Energy Plan, predicated upon “technical-financial assumptions”

for “standard projects”,”° including, as regards wind installations like the Claimants’ Wind

Farms, a 20-year operational life,’” 2,350 operating hours,’® and demand forecasts.”? The

plan was based on “[rJeturn on Project Type: calculated on the basis of maintaining an

existence of a “stable regulatory framework” was credited with the success of the regime
in promoting renewable energies.*! The plan estimated that around 77% of the investment
in renewables would likely be debt-financed and refers to “project finance” as one of the

financing alternatives available to investors.*?

In October 2005, a report by the Asociacién de la Industria Fotovoltaica (“ASIF”), was

published. Regarding the new regulation, the Report points out:

[...] [RD 436/2004] provides a reasonable return on investment for
an average standard facility. This reasonable rate of return is
considered [...] by the Plan for Renewable Energies, as [...] an
internal rate of return on the own equity invested of between 5 and
71%

On 6 October 2005, the Spanish and German Governments made a joint declaration in
Madrid whereby they committed to “promote renewable energies” and “improve the feed-
in system in their respective countries”.** In addition, the two Governments created the
International Feed-in Cooperation, an international platform to promote feed-in systems
of remuneration among other countries and to fund research projects through IDAE (for

Spain) and Fraunhofer ISI (for Germany).

On 15 December 2005, the Spanish Supreme Court issued a judgment concerning an
appeal brought by an association of renewable energy producers against RD 436/2004

(the “2005 Supreme Court judgment”). Among other arguments, the association

contended that RD 436/2004 did not provide for an updating mechanism in respect of one
of the two pricing options (i.e. the Fixed Tariff), while it set out stricter technical
requirements applicable to not only new installations but also existing installations. The
Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on all counts. Drawing upon an earlier judgment
from July 2005, the Court did not consider updates to be mandated by Law 54/1997, but
rather a procedure devised by RD 2818/1998: “[g]iven the normative rank of this Royal
Decree, nothing prevents another norm of the same hierarchical rank from modifying it.”*>

Regarding the additional requirements, the Supreme Court held:

There is no legal obstacle that exists to prevent the Government, in
the exercise of its regulatory powers and of the broad entitlements it
has in a strongly regulated issue, such as electricity, from modifying
a specific system of remuneration, provided that it remains within
the framework established in the [Law 54/1997]. And even though
it might be necessary on the basis of the principle of legitimate
expectations to include transitory provisions for the adaptation to the
new system of existing companies, in no way this demand reaches
the point of respecting the previous regime without the slightest
change during a more or less prolonged period.*®

(6)  RDL 7/2006

108. On 23 June 2006, the Government passed Royal Decree Law 7/2006, adopting urgent
measures for the energy sector (“RDL 7/2006”). Among others, RDL 7/2006 suspended
the remuneration’s revisions for renewable energy technologies including wind power
until a new remuneration scheme dissociated from the TMR was developed (second

transitory provision) and called the Government to do so as soon as possible (second final

provision).*” Respondent contends that RDL 7/2006 was enacted to remedy the perverse

feed-back effect of the TMR (“tariffs are not to pay for a party”).°*
109. The Preamble reads:

The regulation in force since 2003 setting out the methodology for
the approval or modification of the average or reference electricity
tariff identifies a maximum annual limit for any increase to such
tariff and certain costs to be included in its calculation. The
experience concerning its application, especially since 2005 [...],
makes it necessary to authorize the Government to modify the costs
to be considered, as well as to make the limits of tariff variation and
the different tariff groups more flexible. And this with the urgency
determined by the tariff revision scheduled for July 1, 2006, as the
deadline.”

 

30 June 2006, the Wind Projects are refinanced (BayWa not yet a shareholder)

 

110. In response to this new regulation, the main associations of the renewables sector, led by
APPA, the Asociacién Empresarial Edlica (Spanish Wind Energy Association or “AEE”)
and ASIF, addressed a joint letter to the Minister of Energy dated 26 July 2006. The letter

reads:

substantially breaches the regulation of renewable energies

established in the Energy Sector Act [...]”.°?

In a note published shortly after, APPA criticized the new regulation:

Royal Decree-Act 7/2006 was approved last June, which contains a
frontal assault on the national policy for the promotion of
renewables: it eliminates the 80-90% bracket and the mechanisms
of remuneration stability [of Royal Decree 436/2004], without also
considering the established guarantees and time periods. The
standard, which changes the game rules mid-game, introduces
retroactivity and very seriously damages the legitimate expectations
of investors. [...] Royal Decree-Act 7/2006 has been published like
in old times: at night and with aforethought: without prior
consultations of the agents involved and, contrary to what has been
repeatedly stated, the rules of the game have been changed in the
middle of the match. Acquired rights have been modified
retroactively.?!

On 25 October 2006, the Spanish Supreme Court issued another judgment concerning an
amendment to RD 436/2004 which had been brought about by a subsequent decree, not at
issue in this arbitration, namely Royal Decree 2351/2004 (the “2006 Supreme Court
judgment”).”? According to the plaintiff, RD 2351/2004 “changed the system for
calculating the premiums [...] under the special regime”, first, by setting up a new
methodology for updating such premiums in the future and, secondly, by raising from 10
to 15 MW the minimum capacity requirement set forth in RD 436/2004 to qualify for the
full premium. Among other arguments, the plaintiff invoked the principle of legitimate
expectations under Spanish law; it claimed to have invested in reliance of certain legal

conditions remaining stable. The Supreme Court dismissed the appeal:

Until it is replaced by another, the above outlined legal regulation
(Article 30 of the Electricity Law) allows the respective companies
to expect that the fixing of the premiums can be included as a factor
relevant to their obtaining ‘reasonable rates of return with reference
the cost of money in the capital market’ [...]. However the payment
regime under examination does not guarantee to special regime
electricity producers that a certain level of profits or revenues will
be unchanged relative to those obtained in previous years, or that the
formulas for fixing the premiums will stay unchanged.”

 

113. On 26 October 2006, the Minister of Energy appeared before the Senate. He stated in

relation to renewable energy:

[...] It is important for all operators to receive this message and to
be aware that our road map entails adapting to this framework as
quickly as possible, which involves generating more market that we
hope will be efficient, because it is not always so, and obviously, the
tariffs are not going to pay for anyone’s party. Tariffs by law can
only take into account energy costs, and shareholder ventures are
not energy costs.*4

114. On 8 November 2006, the Secretary of Energy also appeared before the Parliament. He

stated:

[...] The regulation of wind power in 2004 was rather unfortunate.
In 2004, the current Royal Decree, 436, established premiums based
on market price expectations. [...] What has happened? That the
price of market now is of 55 or of 60 and the wind power has a total
remuneration of almost 100 Euros/MW-hour. This remuneration has
an IRR of around 20 percent. I believe in renewable energies as
much as anyone, but I also believe that we have to do things
reasonably. Technologies, that is my opinion, whose investment is
guaranteed through a premium [...] they cannot have returns of 20
per cent; nobody has those. Some speculators do have them. We
must be reasonable [...]°°

(7) RD 661/2007

115. The initial draft of what would become RD 661/2007 was released on 28 November 2006.
It did not contain explicit language protecting existing plants from quadrennial revisions.

Draft article 40.3 provided:

During 2010, in view of the results of the monitoring reports on the
degree of compliance with the 2005-2010 Renewable Energies Plan
(PER), and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain
(E4), together with such new targets as may be included in the
subsequent Renewable Energies Plan for the period 2011-2020,
there will be a revision of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and
lower and upper limits defined in this royal decree, application
which shall start from January 2011, considering the costs
associated with each of these technologies, the degree of
participation of the Special Regime in covering the demand and its
impact upon the technical and economic management of the system.
Every four years, a new revision shall be performed.”

116. The final version added a paragraph stating:

The revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits
indicated in this section shall not affect facilities for which the
commissioning certificate had been granted prior to January | of the
second year following the year in which the revision had been
performed.

117. On 19 January 2007, AEE published a note in which it criticized this draft:

[...] the proposal is puzzling as it even advocates amending [the
predefined remuneration] for facilities already in operation and for
investments in progress, while removing the right to receive the
remuneration established, recognised by the current regulation,
which would seriously affect the legal certainty and legitimate
expectations that were generated based on the sustainability that this
regulation guarantees.”

On 14 February 2007, the CNE issued a report on this draft (“CNE Report 3/2007”). It
noted that economic incentives are an essential regulatory instrument to reach the
renewable energy targets set by the Government. It also highlighted the importance of
legal stability for investors and financers, and suggested that any future revisions to the
incentive’s regime should be predefined as in RD 436/2004 and must not affect existing

facilities.** It pointed out at the same time:

As stated by both scientific and jurisprudence doctrine [...] these
principles [of legal certainty and legitimate expectation] do not
prevent the dynamic innovation of the same, or new regulatory
provisions from being applied in the future to situations that
commenced prior to their entry into force, but which continue
following the entry into force of the new rules.”

The preliminary version of this Report refers specifically to the Supreme Court Judgment

of 25 October 2006 and reproduces a large portion of it. The CNE characterized it as “very

illustrative” in relation to the legality under Spanish law of regulatory changes.!
On 19 March 2007, the Government presented a new draft royal decree for consultation.'°!

On 20 March 2007, the Spanish Supreme Court issued another judgment concerning an
amendment to the transitory regime established in RD 436/2004 with regard to the
methodology for updating premiums (“March 2007 Supreme Court judgment”).'” This
measure had been challenged and ruled upon in the 2006 Supreme Court judgment. The
plaintiff claimed, among others, that the amendment reduced by 22.6% the premium value
in force the year before, undermining their legitimate expectations under Spanish law in

view of the fact that they had invested in reliance of this and other legal conditions

remaining stable. The Supreme Court did not agree and rejected the appeal, quoting

extensively from its 2006 judgment.

122. On 21 March 2007, the Ministry of Energy prepared a report on the proposed new
regulation, which the Claimants contend is an internal document which was only released

during document production.'°? According to the Report:

The regulated tariff has been calculated to guarantee a return
between 7% and 8%, depending on the technology. Premiums have
been calculated according to the same criteria established in Royal
Decree 436/2004, that is, the premium has been calculated as the
difference between the regulated tariff and the average market price
considered for these technologies. [...]

With the remuneration provided, the return would be 7% for the
regulated tariff option, and between 5% and 9% for the market sale
option.!%

123. The draft RD 661/2007 was criticized by APPA. In its comments (alegaciones) on the
draft RD 661/2007 APPA contended that the new regulation “breach[ed] the principle[s]
of legal certainty and legitimate expectations: changing the economic regime
retroactively” in respect of installations which had entered into operation under RD
436/2004, in circumstances where, in their view, Article 40.3 only contemplated
quadrennial revisions while ruling out any other adjustment to remunerations. It also
complained about the Government’s use of subsequent decrees to change remuneration’s
regimes through the back door, circumventing Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004. It further

stated that, should the Government go ahead with the proposed regulation, it will...

no longer be credible: any rational investor, when planning facilities
of this type, must bear in mind not only the costs and the foreseeable

remuneration, but it also must consider the risk that such
remuneration could be lowered [in the future].!°5

124. On 9 May 2007, AEE issued a press release criticizing the draft:

For AEE, today the important thing is to ensure the door is not left
open to changes in remuneration parameters at the halfway point, as
is the case with the current wording of the decree. The “stable”
nature of the twenty-year period proposed by the new Royal Decree
for the allocation of remuneration is fictional if the premium
amendments are retroactive as is contradictorily regulated now.!°%

125. On 25 May 2007, Spain enacted Royal Decree 661/2007 (“RD 661/2007”). The new

regulation:

(i) set premium and tariff rates in numerical terms (EUR/kWh), pegged to the
consumer price index (“CPI”); incentives were therefore permanently delinked
from the TMR (including for purposes of revisions which had been suspended by

RDL 7/2006) (Article 44);'°7

(ii) kept the supplement (or, where applicable, penalty) for reactive energy and the

right to sell the full net amount of electricity (Article 17.b);

(iii) set lower and upper limits to the remuneration of qualifying facilities (other than
PV installations) under the market-price-plus-premium option tied to the variation

of the price electricity in the market (“Caps” and “Floors”) (Articles 27 and 36);

stated that fixed tariffs and premiums would be available “[fJor the first 20 years”
of operation of wind installations. “Thereafter”, premiums would drop to zero but
the fixed tariff option would still be available under a reduced value subject to no

specific time limit (Article 36, sub.b.2.1).!°°

A transitory provision, which the Claimants contend (by reference to the witness statement

of Mr. Cefia!®) was agreed upon between AEE and the Government along with caps and

floors, was included in RD 661/2007. This provision granted existing wind farms (i.e.,

those commissioned before 1 January 2008, like the Claimants’ Wind Farms) the

possibility to opt among three alternative remuneration schemes:

Keep the Fixed Tariff of RD 436/2004 and continue to receive this form of

remuneration during all the wind farm’s remaining operational life;
Receive the feed-in remuneration values set in RD 661/2007;

Opt before 1 January 2009 for a transitional period of approximately 5 years (i.e.,
until 31 December 2012), during which wind farms would be remunerated under
the previous Premium option available under RD 436/2004. Once this transitional
period ended (i.e., from 1 January 2013), feed-in remuneration values and the
option to choose between the Regulated Tariff and Premium options of RD
661/2007 would apply for existing wind farms, although without TMR revisions

which, as the Respondent states, were eliminated permanently by RDL 7/2006.!!°

benefit from the premium updates set out in RD 436/2004 because that option was
removed by RDL 7/2006. Respondent argues that RD 661/2007 was therefore publicly
criticized by RE producers.!!? Claimants contend that these criticisms were directed at
the previous draft of RD 661/2007, not the one approved, which was balanced.'!* Virtually
all wind installations opted for the transitory premium option under RD 436/2004.!'4 By
contrast, RD 661/2007 eliminated the right to choose between fixed tariff and pool plus
premium for PV installations over 100 kW with no transitional period, on which basis it
was challenged by a PV investor. The Spanish Supreme Court ruled upon this challenge

in a judgment issued on 3 December 2009 referred to below.!!5

Like RD 436/2004, the revisions set out in RD 661/2007 Art. 44.3 were to be prospective

only. They would not affect existing plants already registered in the Special Regime:

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits
indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the
deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January
of the second year following the year in which the revision shall
have been performed.!'®

RD 661/2007 also established installed capacity targets per technology by reference to the
2005-2010 Renewable Energy Plan.'!’ Once 85% of a technology target was reached, a
period of no less than 12 months would be established by the Secretariat of Energy for all
existing projects using that technology (under development and/or construction) to be
finished so that they could benefit from the economic regime of RD 661/2007. Facilities
included in the RAIPRE after this period would not be entitled to the remuneration

scheme. PV installations reached the 85% target and therefore the Government enacted a

new regulation applicable to PV facilities registered thereafter. This was RD 1578/2008,

which is discussed below.!!8

130. The same day, 25 May 2007, the Government issued a press release, which is one of the
press releases relied on by Claimants to support its legitimate expectations and umbrella

clause claims.!!? The press release reads:

The Government assigns priority to profitability and stability in the
new Royal Decree on renewable energy and cogeneration.

The purpose of this Royal Decree is to improve the remuneration of
those less mature technologies, such as biomass and thermosolar, so
as to be able to meet the objectives of the 2005-2010 Renewable
Energies Plan [...].

The new regulation guarantees a return of 7% for wind and hydraulic
installations opting to cede their output to distributors, and between
5% and 9% if they participate in the electric energy generation
market [...].

[...] The government’s commitment to these energy technologies
has been the reason why in the new regulation stability in time is
sought allowing business owners to plan in the medium and long
term, as well as a sufficient and reasonable return which, like the
stability, makes the investment and engagement in this activity
attractive .

 

Any revisions of tariffs to be carried out in the future will not affect
the facilities already in operation. This guarantee provides legal
certainty for the producer, providing stability for the sector and
promoting its development.!?°

131. On4July 2007, the Spanish Government enacted Law 17/2007. This regulation amended
Article 18.1 of Law 54/1997 to read: “tariffs of last resort will be established in such a
way that the calculation thereof will respect the principle of sufficient revenue and not
cause any distortion to competition.”'?! This is one of the provisions relied upon by
Respondent to support the existence of a principle of sustainability and/or self-sufficiency
of the electricity system. It also updated transitional provision sixteenth of Law 54/1997

to reflect the new 20% renewable energy target set by the European Union.!

132. In July 2007, Péyry issued a report on the Spanish renewable energy market, focusing on

wind energy. It noted that:

The Spanish Government has been historically concerned with the
increases on the regulated tariff as they affect Spanish inflation and
competitiveness. The average reference tariff (TMR — tarifa media
de referencia) was one of the key components to a wind farm’s
remuneration, representing around 50% of the revenues for wind
farms on the Market Option or almost all of its revenue on the Fixed
Tariff Option under RD 436. Hence higher average tariffs were
beneficial for wind generators.

However, owing to the tariff deficit, and windfall profits for wind
farms during 2005 and 2006, the Spanish government has reviewed
the legal framework for the Special Regime (co-gen and
renewables).

Wind generators received (under RD 436) a payment linked to the
TMR. However, this had an unfortunate side effect of a feedback (as
outlined in Péyry’s wind reports from 2004). In essence, this meant
higher system costs as a result of wind farms led to higher TMRs,
which in turn raised remuneration to wind farms, leading to higher
system costs and higher TMRs etc.

121 Taw 17/2007, of 4 July 2007, amending Law 54/1997, C-0501. See also R-0272.

'22 Law 17/2007 amended the content of Transitional Provision Sixteen of Law 54/1997 and relocated it in Additional
Provision Twenty-five, which reads: “The government will modify the Plan for the Promotion of Renewable Energies
to adapt it to the objectives of 20% by 2020 that it has established with respect to the European Union, therefore
maintaining the commitment that this plan established, which was 12% for 2010. These objectives will be taken into
account when establishing the premiums for this type of facility”. R-0079. [Translation from Resp. C-Mem., fn. 126].

45

Given the likelihood of ongoing tariff deficits in the future the
government decided to de-link remuneration from the TMR
permanently. Since the introduction of RD 7/2006 on June 2006,
wind generators have collected the 50% (40% as premium and 10%
as incentive) of the January 2006 TMR, which is €76.588/MWh.

[...] As tends to be the case in Spain, the resulting legislation, RD
661/2007, is a negotiated compromise which is seen as positive by
most of the industry, although key members of the major Spanish
wind association (AEE) have not been too complimentary of the
changes contained within it.'*

133. Also in 2007, ASIF published an article in which it discussed RD 661/2007. After noting

that the regulation seeks to provide a reasonable return to investors, the article states:

[...] but, what is a reasonable rate of return for an investment in
renewable energy, specifically in photovoltaic energy? [...] It is
considered quite reasonable for an investment payback period to be
around ten years, and an internal rate of return on a project (without
financial leverage) around 7%, which is in line with other regulated
investments. [...]!?+

134. On 9 October 2007, the Supreme Court issued a decision on another amendment to RD
436/2004 (“October 2007 Supreme Court judgment”).!”> The amendment provided that
gas cogeneration facilities with installed capacity above 50 MW may (or may not) receive
a premium to be determined by the Government. The plaintiffs claimed that leaving the
matter to the Government’s discretion was in breach of EU Directives, Law 54/1997 and
general principles of law. The Supreme Court rejected the claim. In the Court’s opinion,
EU law affords Member States significant discretion in designing the specific incentives

that they wish to use to promote gas cogeneration facilities, which must, however, be

balanced against the restrictions imposed by EU rules of state aid.'*° Gas cogeneration
facilities with an installed capacity above 50 MW are not included in the Special Regime
and do not therefore have a right to the system of premiums established in Article 30.4.'27
There is no impediment for a royal decree to be amended by another under the principle
of hierarchy of norms.'?* Drawing upon the October 2006 and March 2007 Supreme Court
judgments, the Court held that renewable energy producers do not have an intangible right

to the premium’s regime, nor a vested right to such premiums but a mere expectation.!°
135. Inthe same year, AEE criticized RD 661/2007 in its industry yearbook:

From a regulatory perspective, the new R.D. 661/2007 strays from
the path marked by the regulator and not only revises remuneration
by reducing the premium, but also basically modifies the
mechanisms involved in its allocation and repeals all aspects of the
above-mentioned R.D. 436/2004, regulating on the very same issues
just two years after its approval [...]. On the other hand, the new
decree removes the incentive to participate in the electricity market
and annuls the non-retroactivity of this revision and of future
revisions concerning premiums and remuneration supplements,
thereby applying it universally to all installations regardless of when
they are commissioned. The proposal also entails a high level of
uncertainty with regard to the indices for the annual updating of all
parameters. [...] The measure clearly contradicts the allocation of
these values over a 20-year period, rendering the concept of
durability completely fictitious, insofar as subsequent changes to
these values have also been planned that, as a result, would be
applied retroactively.'*°

 

136. Between 2007 and 2008, Invest in Spain, a State-owned entity, carried out a series of
presentations in foreign countries (including Germany) about “opportunities in Renewable

Energy in Spain”. These presentations point to Spain as the “most attractive country in the

On 10 January 2008, AEE issued a press note assessing the impact of the RD 661/2007 in

respect of wind facilities. It states:

the remuneration of wind energy fell in 2007 to the levels of 2003
and 2004. In the seven months during which the new RD 661/2007
has been in effect, the premium has been lower than that of RD
436/2004 by 5.07 E/MWh. All the wind farms have remained under
RD 436/2004 with an average remuneration of €77.62/MWh
throughout 2007, given that if they had changed to RD 661/2007, it
would have been €74.11/MWh.!35

(8) RD 1578/2008

On 26 September 2008, Royal Decree 1578/2008 (“RD 1578/2008”) put in place a new
remuneration regime applicable to PV installations that were not registered by the
deadline provided by RD 661/2007. The new regime offered lower remunerations and
created a pre-allocation remuneration register (Registro de Preasignacion de Retribucién)
which, among others, gave the Government the power to scale entry into operation of new
installations. RDL 6/2009 (discussed below) did something similar with respect to other

renewable energy technologies including wind power.'*° The Preamble states:

The growth of installed capacity experienced by photovoltaic solar
technology has been much greater than expected. [...] Just as
insufficient compensation would make the investments nonviable,
excessive compensation could have significant repercussions on the
costs of the electric power system and create disincentives for
investing in research and development [...]. Therefore, it is felt that
it is necessary to rationalize compensation and, therefore, the royal
decree that is approved should modify the economic regime
downward, following the expected evolution of the technology, with
a long-term perspective.!*7

139. On 16 October 2008, the Secretary of Energy appeared before the Senate and stated:

[...] The tariff deficit generated for the first time in the year 2000 is
becoming increasingly large and, therefore, more unsustainable. Its
elimination is one of the major challenges that we propose to resolve
during the term. [...] We want to obtain investments that create
wealth, not those that just absorb consumer resources. [...] we must
be aware of the financial sustainability of the cost of energy [...].!°8

140. On 29 October 2008, Mr. Fernando Marti Scharfhausen, Vice President of CNE, made a
power point presentation entitled “The Legal and Regulatory Framework of Renewable

Energies”. Reference was made to:

b. Regulatory stability. Predictability and certainty of economic
incentives over the lifetime of the facility (encourage investors and
lower financial costs): non-retroactivity.!*?

141. During 2009, Spanish Government officials participated in events overseas where they
highlighted Spain’s regulatory framework for renewable energies. For instance, Mr.

Sebastian stated at the International Renewable Energy Agency Conference in Bonn:

February 2010, slide 29, C-0418. The presentation stresses the importance of the “security and predictability of the
economic supports” in order to eliminate “regulatory risk (warranty by law)” and reduce uncertainty to “investors
(and Banks)”.

143.

Spain has made a clear commitment to attain the maximum
contribution of renewable energies to our energy system. As a result
of this commitment, Spain is among the world leaders regarding
installed capacity in technologies such as wind, photovoltaic, solar
thermal, and biofuels. Renewable facilities amount to 34 GB out of
a total 91 GB installed capacity, generating around 20% of our total
output. Our wind sector is especially remarkable. Wind contribution
to our power generation already exceeds 10%. [...]

In our experience, one of the key factors to this success is the design
of an adequate regulatory framework that grants the long-term
stability required to undertake the necessary investments.'*°

On 9 and 13 February 2009, CNE officials Messrs. Carlos Solé and Luis Jestis Sanchez
de Tembleque made a presentation entitled “Economic Study of Renewable Energies”,
where they analysed the economic profitability of renewables.'+! The presentation states
that “[a]llowing a remuneration to investments with a profitability higher than the WACC
implies that the business will be able to develop the project with profitability.”!*? They
also discussed the financing of renewable projects through “project finance”, mentioning

a “financial leverage between 55% and 90% of the investment.”!47

(9) RDL 6/2009
Royal Decree Law 6/2009 of 30 April 2009 adopted new measures in the energy sector
(“RDL 6/2009”). Its preamble reads:

amounts collected from the regulated tariffs established by the

October 2009: “An important factor has been Spain's early adoption of an appropriate energy policy, which provides
producers with a guarantee that all the electricity they produce will be purchased by distribution companies at
different premiums over the market price.”, C-0357; and the speech of Dr. Marin in Los Angeles, CA, also in October

market and the real costs associated to such tariffs) is provoking
serious problems that, in the context of the current international
financial crisis, is seriously affecting the system and not only putting
the financial situation of the companies in the electric power sector
at risk, but also the sustainability of the system itself. This imbalance
is unsustainable [...]'4+

144. RDL 6/2009 imposed on prospective investors additional conditions to access the Special
Regime. It set up a Pre-Allocation Register akin to that put in place by RD 1578/2008 for
PV installations, with stricter requirements to achieve pre-registration, and gave the
Government power to scale entry into operation of pre-registered installations where the
economic or technical sustainability of the SES so required (Fifth Transitory Provision).
This power was exercised through the Council of Minister’s Agreement of 13 November
2009, referred to below. It also prescribed that from 2013 onwards, access tolls had to be
sufficient to satisfy all of the costs of the regulated activities without any ex-ante deficit

(Article 1).!45

145. RDL 6/2009 was not welcomed by renewable energy producers. For example, the

renewable energy association APPA commented that:

That is how Miguel Sebastian, who has never met with or considered
the sector regarding the regulatory changes, confirmed his declared
commitment to meeting the European objectives. Meanwhile, in
Spain he had created another obstacle for Spanish renewables. Two
days later, Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 was published in the BOE,
passed by the Council of Ministers on 30 April, adopting diverse
measures to reduce the tariff deficit and to increase the
administrative obstacles for clean energy. The measures under the
RDL [...] will make the sector's development even more difficult,

4 RDL 6/2009, Preamble, C-0399. See also R-0088.

'45 Article 1.1 of RDL 6/2009 modified the Twenty-First Transitional Provision of Law 54/1997 and established that
“as from January 1, 2013, the access tolls will cover all the costs of the regulated activities, without allowing any ex
ante deficit to arise”, C-0399.

Sl

while, as in other sectors, it suffers from funding issues arising from
the crisis.!4°

146. On 20 May 2009, APPA and Greenpeace submitted to the Ministry of Energy a proposal
for a draft bill on a Renewable Energies Development Act.'4? The draft proposed
economic incentives to achieve “reasonable rates of return”, which were in line with feed-
in regulations already in place. Calculations were based on estimated costs per type of
facility and “an annual percentage rate equivalent to the previous year's average yield on
10-year Spanish government bonds, plus a spread of 300 basis points”. Grandfathering

provisions were included.

147. On 13 November 2009, the Council of Ministers issued a resolution concerning renewable
energy facilities subject to RDL 6/2009. The Spanish Government decided to accept in
the Special Regime new capacity above the initial wind and CSP’s objectives based on

two technical reports that concluded that this was technically and economically feasible,

148

although not without risks in view of the decline in the electricity deman According

to the resolution, overall benefits of additional renewable installations “greatly exceed the

costs and justify the support for renewable energy of the regulatory framework”.!4°

“The renewable energy associations condemn some of the requirements that Article 4 of RDL 6/2009 demands as
being practically impossible to achieve, preventing many projects from being carried out and which will subsequently
lead to an industrial standstill and job loss. A clear and disastrous example can be seen in Royal Decree 1578, which
regulates activity relating to solar photovoltaic technology and has caused the sector to grind to a halt, leading to
factory closures and investment relocation. The new RDL may have the same impact on other renewable technologies
and even affect wind energy, the most developed.” APPA, ADAP, APREAN, EolicCat, GiWatt and the Cluster of

On 3 December 2009, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to RD 661/2007 brought
by owners of PV facilities (“3 December 2009 Supreme Court judgment”).!*° The
appellants sought to reverse the exclusion of PV facilities from RD 661/2007’s transitional
period, under which other installations including wind farms could still be remunerated
pursuant to the Pool Price plus Premium and Incentive option available under the previous
RD 436/2004 until December 2012, whereas PV facilities could not. Among other
arguments, they contended that RD 661/2007 breached their legitimate expectations under
Spanish law by “disregarding the guarantee against retroactivity set out in Article 40.3 of
RD 436/2004.”'>! The Supreme Court dismissed all grounds of challenge. It held that such
“petrification” of the economic regime did not follow from Law 54/1997, which affords
the Government a margin of discretion to set remuneration values and delimit transitional

periods as appropriate. In doing so, it relied on the 2005 Supreme Court judgment.'>?

On 9 December 2009, the Supreme Court issued another decision on essentially the same
amendment at issue in the October 2007 Supreme Court judgment (“9 December 2009
Supreme Court judgment”).'** The amendment provided that gas cogeneration facilities
with installed capacity above 50 MW could receive a premium subject to the
Government’s discretion. The appellants claimed that leaving the matter to the
Government’s discretion was in breach of EU Directives, Law 54/1997 and general
principles of Spanish law. The Supreme Court found the amendments to conform with EU
Directives and Law 54/1997, noting that gas cogeneration facilities like those of the
appellants were not included in the Special Regime and did not have a right to the system

of premiums established in Article 30.4. It added:

[...] [the Claimants] [do] not pay enough attention to the case law of

150. In response to Directive 2009/28/EC, which set new renewable energy targets for Spain,
the Government approved on 30 June 2010 the Plan de Accién Nacional de Energias
Renovables de Espafia. Calculations in this Plan are again predicated upon
technical/financial assumptions for standard projects including forecasts to achieve
reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money in the capital market.
Reference was also made to “sustainability criteria”, the need for “stability” and to
“minimising the speculative risks posed in the past by excessive rates of return, which not

only hurts consumers but it is also damaging to the industry in general”.!°°

updated feed-in values applicable to wind facilities pursuant to Article 44.1 of RD

facilities as of 2013 (i.e. the end of the RD 661’s transitory period), including the option

152. In February 2010, a study of the Supreme Court’s case law was published on a renewable

energy sector magazine. The study recounts that:

[..] retroactivity on premiums was indeed granted and explained by
the Supreme Court [...]. As we have been saying, it is nothing new,
and we will now look at why: Recently, the [...] ruling of 3
December 2009, [...] based on a ruling of 15 December 2005, stated
literally that: ‘the appellant commercial entities have no right to the
remuneration regimen of the electricity sector remaining unchanged,
[...] and ‘does not guarantee the perpetuation of the existing
situation’; which can be modified at the discretion of the institutions
and public authorities to impose new regulations taking into account
the needs of the general interest. [The appeal was overturned as] the
return of the activity of generation from this technology was higher
than that considered as sufficient and reasonable remuneration. !*

In April 2010, APPA published another report on the Supreme Court’s case law on

Also in April 2010, the Ministry of Energy released a set of files including one eight-page

document titled “Elementos para un acuerdo sobre la politica energética”.'®° Among

Supreme Court case-law is conclusive: it openly and emphatically
justifies retroactivity of the rules that regulate or which could
regulate the economic regime of the special regime, whilst
respecting the principles established in Law [...]

[...] these ‘reasonable rates of return’ that the Supreme Court itself
has fixed, based on IDAE indications, at Internal Rate of Return of
7 percent.

[it is worth] fleeing from any optimism [...] a certain modification
to the premiums [...] beneath that 7 percent [...] could perfectly be
validated by the court [...] maintaining that the ‘reasonable nature’
of the rates of return in the year 2006 or 2007 may have stood at the
aforementioned 7 percent, but there is no reason why this figure
should be matched at the time the modification is made.!°°

limitation of hours subject to premium, premium values, transitional periods and the scope

of future revisions.

156. On 2 July 2010, the Secretary of Energy sent a draft to Mr. José Donoso, AEE chairman,
entitled “Agreement with the Wind Sector”. It reported that the Ministry of Energy had
“reached an agreement with the wind sector whereby it undertakes to promote the

following actions”:

1. Temporary and extraordinary 35% reduction of the reference
premium currently in force for wind farms subjected to Royal
Decree 661/2007, applicable from the entry into force of the new
Royal Decree and until 12/31/2012, notwithstanding the annual
updates of the reference premium in accordance with Royal Decree
661/2007. The rules established in First Transitional Provision
remain unchanged until 12/31/2012 and thereafter shall be subject
to the provisions of Royal Decree 661/2007, with annual updates.

2. Amendment of Art. 44.3 of Royal Decree 661/2007 stating
that future revisions of the premiums should not affect existing
facilities, in precisely the same manner as currently established for
regulated tariffs and upper and lower limits, nor those facilities,
upon approval of the review, that were already registered into the
Pre-allocation Remuneration Register established by Royal Decree-
Law 6/2009, of April 30.

3. For those years in which the average production values of
the industry as a whole exceed the provisions of PER2005-2010
(2,350 hrs), the hours of each plant exceeding 2,589 hrs (2,345
+10%) shall be remunerated at the pool price. [...]!°?

157. The same day, 2 July 2010, a press release was issued whereby the Respondent announced
the following:
July 2, 2010 The Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce has

closed agreements with wind and thermosolar energy industry
representatives, the Spanish Wind Energy Association (AEE) and

the Spanish Thermosolar Industry Association, Protermosolar,
respectively, for the revision of the regulatory frameworks of
electric power production from these technologies.

The agreements [with the CSP and wind sectors] include short-term
measures that will reduce the impact of these technologies on the
price of electricity, as well as long-term measures which will
provide these technologies with stability and certainty for their
future development.

The wind energy premiums established in RD 661/2007 will be
reduced by 35% until January 1, 2013. [...]

[...] the number of hours entitled to the remuneration above the
market price is limited for wind and thermosolar plants, taking into
account the different technologies and what was set out in the 2005-
2010 Renewable Energies Plan for the calculation of the facilities’
profitability.

This measure, which does not compromise the profitability of
existing facilities will guarantee that renewable production above
the one foreseen benefits consumers and does not compromise the
economic sustainability of the system.

Also, this agreement strengthens the visibility and stability of the
regulation of these technologies for the future, guaranteeing the
current premiums and tariffs of RD 661/2007 for facilities in
operation (and for those included in the pre-register) after 2013. [...]

Industry will immediately begin the process which will allow the
content of the agreement to be converted into a law.'®

158. On 9 July 2010, AEE issued a bulletin reporting on the agreement reached with the

Government.!™ The bulletin noted:

The Spanish Association of Wind Power Businesses [...], in
representation of the wind power sector, has finally reached an

agreement with the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Commerce and
Tourism (MICyT) under which there will be a temporary reduction
in the remuneration for operating installations in exchange for
greater regulatory stability.'®

159. On 13 July 2010, a legal opinion about case law on renewables was published in a Spanish

law review. The opinion stated:

As has been explained, we understand that a modification of the
tariffs established in RD 1578/2008 (ACT 13234/2008) applicable
to authorised facilities that are operational prior to such amendment,
could be interpreted by the courts as “foreseeable” and in no case
diminishing the principle of legitimate expectations.'©

160. A first draft of what became RD 1614/2010, dated 14 July 2010, was disclosed to AEE on
15 July 2010.'*” AEE suggested specific changes to this draft by a communication sent on

20 July.'® A new draft followed on 30 July 2010, which was circulated for observations

along with a first explanatory report (Memoria) of the same date.'©?

161. On30 August 2010, AEE made formal observations (alegaciones) to this new draft. They

stated:

The proposed modification of the remuneration regime of the
reactive energy, if approved, would have a level of retroactivity such
that, according to the Jurisprudence of the Constitutional Court, it
may be considered of a “minimum degree” as it only has an impact
on the economic effects that in a future would be produced although

the basic situation or relation has arisen in accordance with the
previous one.

It is true that the Supreme Court has declared, in relation to this type
of retroactive modification, that it is not an “unchangeable right”
that the economic regime remains unaltered [...] thus recognizing a
relatively broad margin to the “ius variandi” of the Administration
in a regulated sector involving general interests.[...] the
jurisprudence has established limits [...] with regard to the
retroactive modification of this remuneration framework, in
particular “that the requirements of the Law on the Electrical Sector
are observed with regard to the reasonable return of investments.

Lastly, the sector is sensitive to the economic situation in Spain and
the exceptional fall in the demand for electricity, which may require
measures of joint responsibility that, in the case of wind energy,
must be limited in time and scope, in proportion to the specific needs
of this technology and its contribution to the electrical system. !”°

162. On 26 October 2010, the Ministry of Energy issued a report in which it stated in reference

to what would become Article 5.3 of the proposed regulation:

Article 4 of the project, to compensate the above restriction, also
guarantees to the thermoelectric facilities covered by the Royal
Decree 661/2007 and affected by it, that future quadrennial reviews
rates, bonuses and upper and lower limits for this kind of
technology, provided in Article 44.3 thereof, shall not apply to
them.!7!

163. On4 November 2010, after the Government decided to divide the new regulation into two
decrees (i.e. RD 1614/2010 and RD 1565/2010), a new explanatory report (Memoria) of
the draft Royal Decree (1614/2010) (“2010 Regulatory Impact Report”) was issued. It

states:

10 Submission presented by the majority wind energy association AEE before the CNE against the draft RD
1614/2010, dated 30 August 2009, pp. 6, 2, R-0166. (Emphasis omitted)

The installed power objectives set out under the Renewable Energy
Plan 2005-2010 have been reached or exceeded for the solar thermal
and wind power technologies. While this development can be
considered a major achievement for all actors involved [...] it has
also caused problems that need to be addressed before they pose an
irreversible threat to the economic and technical sustainability of the
system.

[...] This Royal Decree provides a series of austerity measures to
contribute to transferring to society the gain from the proper
evolution of these technologies in terms of competitiveness in
relative costs, reducing the deficit of the power system, while
safeguarding the legal security of investments and the principle of
reasonable profitability.!””

 

  

164. In relation to the limit introduced for operating hours for which premiums would be

payable, the 2010 Regulatory Impact Report noted that:

The remuneration values of Royal Decree 661/2007 were calculated
in order to obtain reasonable profitability rates and by taking the
installations’ average operating hours of these three technologies as
an initial hypothesis. These operating hours can be found in the
Renewable Energy Plan 2005-2010, for all technologies.
Subsequently, during actual system operation, it was shown that the
hours of operation of the installations, in some cases, exceed those
initially expected, for various reasons, technological improvement,
over-installation, etc. In any case, this means that, for them, the
remuneration obtained exceeds that which is considered
reasonable. !73

  

165. Regarding future revisions, it stated that:

[...] as compensation for the reduction in remuneration for the given
period, the wording of Article 44 of Royal Decree 661/2007 is
amended, thereby guaranteeing the installations in operation, and
those pre-allocated, that the value of the regulated and maximum

tariffs, as well as the value of the bonus [premium], will stay the
same over time.!™4

On 23 November 2010, Royal Decree 1565/2010 was enacted (“RD 1565/2010”). RD
1565/2010 affected mostly PV facilities (including RAIPRE pre-registered facilities). It
capped the quantity of electricity produced by PV plants that was eligible to receive
incentive tariffs and eliminated such tariffs after 25 years of operation (Article 1. Tenth),
later extended to 28 years and then to 30 years. As noted above, RD 661/2007 set a tariff
rate for the first 25 years of operation of a PV installation and then 80% of the feed-in-
tariff for the remaining life of the facility (both adjusted for inflation). RD 1565/2010 also
modified Article 18 of RD 661/2007 to impose additional technical requirements and
reduced the tariff rate available to PV facilities under the RD 1578/2008 regime. Under
RD 1578/2008 (as enacted), tariff rates decreased from year to year, in line with the
maturing of the sector, and a formula was set out to calculate future tariff rates. RD
1565/2010 enacted a new level of tariffs that, according to the Claimants, resulted in
“another major cutback to the Feed-in remuneration scheme applicable to the PV

subsector”,!7°

RD 1565/2010, along with RDL 14/2010 referred to below, were challenged under the
ECT in Charanne B.V. and Construction S.A.R.L v. Kingdom of Spain, where the Tribunal

tuled in favour of Spain.

On 3 December 2010, the Government announced the approval of RD 1614/2010 with the
following press release:
The Council of Ministers has approved a Royal Decree that

regulates remuneration of electricity production by the wind and
concentrated solar power technologies.

6/2009 of 30 April, for the wind and solar thermoelectric technologies.

The new regulations, which were agreed with both sectors last July,
have the main objectives of obtaining savings to benefit consumers
and to make the objectives of promotion of renewable energies
compatible with those of limiting electricity production costs to
guarantee the sustainability of the electricity system.

The regulation also involves reinforcement of the visibility and
stability of the regulation of these technologies in the future, and
guarantees the present premiums and tariffs of Royal Decree
661/2007 as of 2013 for facilities in operation and for those included
on the pre-register.

WIND ENERGY

The premiums are reduced by 35 per cent for wind technology
installations adhered to said Royal Decree of 2007 and those with a
power exceeding 50 MW linked to those of the special regime, for
the period between the date of this Royal Decree coming into force
and December 31, 2012.

From January 1, 2013, these installations shall recover the premium
values, as the premiums set in the Ministerial Order of 2009 that
reviews the tariffs and premiums of the special regime installations,
shall be applicable. !7°

On 8 December 2010, Royal Decree 1614/2010 was published (“RD 1614/2010”).
According to the Claimants, this was intended to implement the July 2010 agreement
between operators and the Government.'”’ Its Preamble states that: “[t]his Royal Decree

intends to resolve certain inefficiencies in the application of [...] Royal Decree-Law

"8 RD 1614/2010, R-0105. Claimants’ English, translation C-0029t: “this Royal Decree aims to resolve certain
inefficiencies in the implementation of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 of April 30, for wind and thermosolar
technologies.” With respect to thermal solar facilities, RD 1614/2010 suspended this remuneration option for twelve
months.

63

170. With respect to wind power, RD 1614/2010 established that premium values under RD
661/2007 would be reduced by about 35% and that such reduction would apply to all
facilities save for those which had elected (under the First Transitory Provision of RD
661/2007) to be remunerated in accordance with RD 436/2004, as the Claimants’ Wind
Farms had done.'”? Such facilities would remain subject to RD 436/2004 premium values
until 31 December 2012. From then on, however, all existing facilities including the Wind
Farms would be subject to the premium values set in RD 661/2007 for year 2010 (instead
of the higher 2013 values that would have otherwise applied) (Article 5.2).'*°

171. Additionally, RD 1614/2010 limited the number of hours of operation subject to premium
in the event that certain caps were surpassed (Article 2.4). It also stated that this limitation
would not be later revised for facilities registered in the RAIPRE (like the Claimants’

Wind Farms) or the pre-allocation Register created by RDL 6/2009 (Article 2.4 in fine):

The reference equivalent hours [2,350 and 2,589 hours/year], shall
not be revisable during their operational life, for those facilities
finally registered on the administrative Register of power production
facilities under the special regime, part of the General Directorate of
Energy Policy and Mining as of May 7, 2009 and for those facilities
registered on the remuneration pre-allocation Register pursuant to
the Fourth Transitional Provision of Royal Decree-Law 6/2009 of
April 30, and that comply with the obligation established in Article
4.8 thereof.'*!

172. Also, pursuant to Article 5.3 RD 1614/2010:

Without prejudice to that set forth in this royal decree, for wind
power technology facilities governed under Royal Decree 661/2007,
of May 25, the reviews of the tariffs, premiums and lower and upper
limits referred to in Article 44.3 of the aforementioned royal decree
will not affect the facilities finally registered in the Register of
Production Facilities under the Special Regime dependent on the
General Directorate of Energy Policy and Mining as of May 7, 2009,

(11) RDL 14/2010

173. A few days later, on 23 December 2010, a new access toll was introduced by Royal Decree
Law 14/2010 on urgent measures for the correction of the tariff deficit in the electricity
sector (“RDL 14/2010”). All electricity producers, both under the Ordinary and Special
Regimes, were required to pay a toll to use the transportation and distribution grids. RDL
14/2010 also limited the annual operating hours amenable to premium for which PV

installations could receive feed-in-tariffs. The Preamble contained the following recitals:

The impact of the global crisis, which traverses the Spanish
economy, has led to a significant decline in the demand for electric
energy [...] Thus, a set of provisions is established, so that all
industry agents contribute, in a further and combined effort, to the
reduction of the deficit of the electricity system. Special attention
and care has been taken not to affect the economic-financial balance
of companies within the sector [...] to ensure that [...] power
generation companies under the special regime receive adequate and
reasonable compensation. [...]

[...] it seems reasonable that producers under the special regime also
make a contribution to mitigate the extra costs of the system; this
contribution should be proportional to the characteristics of each
technology, [...] and the existing margin in remuneration, while
guaranteeing in any case a reasonable profitability. This method has
been used with the same purpose during the approval in recent
months by the Government of regulatory measures aimed at
electricity producers using wind turbine, thermosolar and
cogeneration technologies. !**

174. After the Council of Ministers’ meeting at which RDL 14/2010 was approved, the

Government issued the following press release:

The Council of Ministers has adopted a Royal Decree Law
containing a number of measures to reduce the regulated costs of the
electric power system; the primary goal of this Royal Decree Law is
to ensure the system’s economic sustainability and help eliminate
the so-called tariff deficit according to the schedule established in
2009.

The electric power sector is going through an exceptional situation
caused by a sudden drop in electricity demand. [...]

The direct consequence of this situation has been a loss of revenue
for the whole system, as well as an increase in total regulated costs,
due to the effects of the fall in demand.

Since 2009, the Government has adopted a series of measures to
rationalize regulated costs and reduce the tariff deficit. [...]

In 2010, the Government has continued to work on cost reduction
and has adopted a number of technical measures to improve quality:

-Agreement with the wind sector, which temporarily reduces their
premiums by 35%, limits the number of hours eligible for premiums,
[...] eliminates the option to pay market price plus premium (more
advantageous than the regulated tariff option) for all plants
registered in the pre-registry for one year; delays the entry into
operation of plants registered in the preregistry; and limits the
number of hours with the right to receive premiums based on the
different technologies in place.'*

175. On 26 January 2011, the Minister of Energy, Miguel Sebastian Gasc6n, appeared before

the Lower House of the Parliament. He stated:

'84 Press release of the meeting of the Council of Ministers of Spain of 23 December 2010, C-0164.

66

[...] since 2009, the Government has been working to adopt a set of
measures whose common denominator is the streamlining of
regulated costs and the reduction of the tariff deficit [...]!*>

These actions in 2009, [...] have continued to be used in 2010, first,
after reaching an agreement with the wind farm sector, reducing
their premiums temporarily by 35 percent and permanently limiting
the number of hours they are entitled to premiums. [...]'*°

All these measures have come about from dialogue, both with the
sectors affected as well as with the main political forces. But these
measures of 2009 and 2010 have not been enough. The imbalances
have been accentuated as a consequence of the appearance of a
series of adverse circumstances, in some cases exceptional, of which
I should like to highlight two. Firstly, the above forecast growth of
some of the regulatory costs during 2010, in particular the premiums
of the special regime, and secondly, the evolution of electricity
demand, which in 2009 fell 4.7%. This is the first fall in electricity
demand after 25 years of sustained increases of around 4% per year.
These decreases in electricity demand reduce the income of the
system and entail fixed costs that have to be paid by fewer users of
electricity, which raises the cost per user. These two circumstances
have increased the tariff deficit and have meant that the measures
adopted thus far to guarantee the progressive reduction of the tariff
deficit in a balanced way among all sector agents proved to be
inefficient. Consequently, the need to urgently approve new

measures. !87

176. As noted above, RDL 14/2010 (along with other measures affecting PV investors) was
challenged and upheld in Charanne. Claimants here deny it to be a breach of the ECT
because Article 17 of Law 54/1997 allowed the Respondent to impose access tolls. It was

known and accepted. !**

177. In March 2011, the consulting firm Péyry published a report on the “Current and Future

Trends in the Spanish Solar Industry”. The report states:

[...] the zero deficit target is unlikely to be met by the end of 2012
[...]. If the zero tariff deficit target by end of 2012 is postponed, it
will open up the opportunity to more deficit generation. Considering
the Government behaviour, it is likely that future changes might be
implemented if considered needed. [...] We feel that the
Government is in a position to continue with the same energy policy,
if considered a requirement, including implementation of further
reductions in remuneration to renewables and non — renewable
technologies.'*?

178. In June 2011, APPA lodged an appeal against RD 1565/2010 in which it stated:

A number of judgments by that High Court [i.e. Supreme Court]
have rested on the argument that changing the special remuneration
regime for electricity generation to reflect changing circumstances
over time is in the hands of the legislator, subject solely to the
requirement that such changes respect the provisions of section 30.4
of the Electricity Sector Act, so that the modifications do not affect
“reasonable rates of return with regard to the cost of money in
capital markets” as guaranteed in the aforementioned Act. These
Supreme Court judgments are those handed down on 25 October
2006; 20 March 2007; 3 December 2009; 9 December 2009
(Tarragona Power, S.L.) and another of the same date.!°

(12) RDL 1/2012

On 27 January 2012, the new Spanish Government passed Royal Decree-Law 1/2012
(RDL 1/2012”).!°! RDL 1/2012 suppressed the feed-in remuneration regime of RD
661/2007 for new Special Regime facilities. Facilities which, at the time of the entry into
force of RDL 1/2012, had been finally registered in the RAIPRE — such as the Claimants’
Wind Farms — were excluded from its scope of application. The preamble summarises the

efforts made by RDL 6/2009 and RDL 14/2010 to address the tariff deficit. It then states:

[...] the measures adopted so far have not been sufficient, and the
final purpose of eliminating the tariff deficit as from 2013 is still in
jeopardy.

In light of the above, it was considered appropriate to withdraw the
economic incentives for certain special regime facilities and for
certain ordinary regime facilities using similar technologies, as well
as to suspend the remuneration pre-allocation procedures
established for them, in order to address the problem of the
electricity sector high tariff deficit in a more favourable
environment. By adopting this measure [RDL 1/2012], the
Government has chosen to limit its scope to special regime facilities
not yet registered in the Remuneration Pre-Allocation Registry,
except where such condition is due to the Administration’s failure
to comply with the relevant time limit for making a decision. Along
these lines, it has been decided to limit the scope of this measure in
order to prevent it from affecting investments already made with
regard to ordinary regime facilities, not subject to the pre-allocation
scheme.

This Royal Decree-Law maintains the remuneration regime
established in the legal system for facilities already in operation and
for those already registered on the Remuneration Pre-Allocation
Registry.

181. On the same day the Government issued a press release, stating that further measures
needed to be taken to correct the tariff deficit, reaffirming the need for renewable energy

support, and noting that...

The regulation is not retroactive, i.e., it will not affect facilities
already in operation, premiums already authorised or facilities
already registered in the pre-allocation registries. !°°

182. On the same day RDL 1/2012 was approved, a press conference was held. The new
Minister of Energy, Mr. José Manuel Soria Lépez, affirmed that the new regulation would

not affect vested rights:

[...] this Royal Decree-Law does not in any way affect any vested
rights, not only of the holders of renewable energy plants already in
operation, but also of the companies which have been granted a pre-
allocation, regardless whether they have started to operate the plant
or not. By this, I mean that this provision does not foresee any kind
of retroactivity; we only consider it from now onwards. !*4

by producers against RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010, which, as noted above, eliminated
regulated tariffs for PV facilities after 25 years of operation (later extended to 28 and then
30 years) and introduced new access tolls, respectively.'°° Among other grounds,

producers argued that these changes were retroactive and breached the Spanish law

Government and the autonomous community of Galicia. See Spanish of the Supreme Court Judgment of 20

principle of legitimate expectations as they had invested in reliance of a regulated tariff
with no time limit as set out in RD 661/2007. The Supreme Court rejected all these
challenges, referring where appropriate to previous decisions. For instance, in a judgment
issued on 12 April 2012, the reasoning of which has been confirmed in several later

decisions, the Court held with regard to the retroactivity claim:

The concept of ‘prohibited retroactivity’ is much more limited than
that of mere ‘retroactivity’ [...]

[...] the remit of prohibited retroactivity does not include provisions
which, lacking any ablative or pejorative effects towards the past
(they do not require the revision nor removal of past facts, they do
not alter the reality already experienced over time and they do not
annul the legal effects exhausted), [...] deploy their immediate
effectiveness looking towards the future even if this means
impacting a relationship or legal situation which are still in progress.

Based on this premise, a regulatory measure such as the one
challenged in the present litigation, whose effectiveness is not
planned “back” in time but rather ‘forward’, once it has been
approved, does not fall within the remit of prohibited retroactivity.

[...] Retroactivity would occur if the new regulation required the
owners of photovoltaic installations to return the amount of those
tariffs already received in previous financial years, but not when it
merely stipulates that their receipt will cease within thirty years.
Strictly speaking, it could not even be classified as a retroactive
measure and all the less so if we use this legal concept in its ‘proper’
sense.”

184. In respect of the legitimate expectations claim, the judgment states that the regulatory

regime set out in RD 661/2007, including the provisions that offered a regulated tariff for

an indefinite period of time after 25 years of operation of a PV facility, were subject to
“implicit” limits stemming from the operating life of a standard renewable energy
facility.'°° The judgment also refers to the Government’s learning curve with renewable

energy technologies. It added:

[...] as we have stated on many occasion, the owners of electrical
energy production installations under a special regime do not have
an “unmodifiable right” to maintain unchanged the economic
regime.

Private operators [...] who ‘renounce’ the market, even if they do so
more or less “induced” by the generous remuneration offered to
them by the regulatory framework, without any recompense for
assuming major risks, were aware or should have been aware that
said public regulatory framework, approved at a given time, in the
same way as it was consistent with the conditions of the economic
scenario in force at that time and with the electricity demand
forecasts made at that time, could not subsequently be immune to
any relevant modifications to basic economic data in the light of
which it is logical for the public authorities to keep in step with the
new circumstances. [...] And this is all the more so in the event of
situations involving a widespread economic crisis and, in the case
of electrical energy, in view of the growth in the tariff deficit which,
to acertain degree, derives from the impact that the remuneration of
the former has on the calculation of access fees by way of the
regulated tariff insofar as it is a cost imputable to the electricity
system.

[...] even when [RD 661/2007] (...) talk[s] — in its original version —
of a period “subsequent” to the 25 years, it can easily be assumed
that this implicitly set as a ceiling or termination the final date of the
working life of the photovoltaic installations [...]

[...] Hence, the updating and revision system for tariffs, premiums
and complements set out in article 44 of Royal Decree 661/2007 and
specified in article 36 of the same Royal Decree for category b)
installations may be modified by Royal Decree 1565/2010 whose
determinations are not subject to that laid down by the previous one.

188.

As there are no regulatory hierarchy relations between both, it can
hardly be asserted that the precept contained in one Royal Decree
“breaches” precepts of another which is just as equally binding [...]

Similarly, another judgment concerning a challenge against RD 1565/2010 rendered in

June 2012 stated:

According to the claim, [...] the ‘significant loss in returns’ [...] must
be viewed by comparing the rates of return resulting from this
Decree with those resulting from the regulations prior to this Decree
[...] The idea that the ‘reasonable rate of return’ estimated at a
particular moment in time must remain unaltered, at other moments
in time, cannot be shared. Depending on changing economic and
other circumstances, a rate of return percentage viewed as
‘reasonable’ in a first instance, may require subsequent adjustments
precisely in order to maintain the ‘reasonableness’ when faced with
the modification of other economic and technical factors.!”

The Court dismissed challenges against the new access toll introduced by RDL 14/2010

following similar reasoning.”

THE DISPUTED MEASURES

Starting in December 2012, the Respondent adopted the following measures which are

challenged by the Claimants in this case (the “Disputed Measures”).

(1) Law 15/2012

On | January 2013, Law 15/2012 entered into force. It introduced a 7% tax on all revenue
from the generation of electricity (“TWPEE”), whether from conventional or renewable
sources. The preamble states that this measure was introduced to address the tariff

imbalance and out of environmental concerns. It also provides that an amount equal to

89 Supreme Court, 19 June 2012, Case No. 62/2011, R-0146 [English translation from Resp. C-Mem., para. 348].
200 See e.g., Supreme Court, 25 June 2013, Case No. 252/2012, R-0150 (dismissing an indirect challenge to RD
1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010); Supreme Court, Judgment 63/2016, 21 January 2016, Case No. 627/2012, R-O155
(dismissing a challenge to RD 1565/2010, RDL 14/2010 and Law 2/2011).

73

that collected through the TVPEE would be allocated to finance the costs of the Electricity

System (Second Additional Provision).

189. Law 15/2012 created three additional taxes, which are not disputed in this arbitration: (i)
a tax on production of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, (ii) a tax on storage of
spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, and (iii) a levy on use of continental waters for

electricity production.

(2)  RDL 2/2013

190. On 1 February 2013, Royal Decree Law 2/2013 (“RDL 2/2013”) was issued, effective as
of 1 January. It fixed the premium under the Premium option of RD 661/2007 at 0
EUR/kWh (thereby effectively eliminating this option) (Article 2). According to
Respondent’s Witness Mr. Ayuso, this led to all existing wind facilities opting for the

fixed tariff as of that date.2°!

191. In addition, RDL 2/2013 cancelled the mechanism for updating tariffs, premiums and
remaining elements of remuneration in accordance with the Consumer Price Index,
substituting a different index, the CPI at constant tax rates, which excluded unprocessed
foods and energy products (Article 1). It also eliminated the possibility to choose on a
yearly basis the feed-in remuneration option (Article 3), meaning that those Special
Regime facilities that after the entry into force of RDL 2/2013 on 2 February 2013 opted
to sell their electricity under the “new” Premium at 0 EUR/kWh option would no longer

be entitled to choose the fixed tariff option during the remainder of their operational life.?°”

(3) RDL 9/2013

192. On 12 July 2013, Spain adopted Royal Decree Law 9/2013 (“RDL 9/2013”), effective
from 1 January 2013. RDL 9/2013 amended Article 34 of Law 54/1997 (which created
the Special Regime for renewables producers) and repealed RD 661/2007 altogether. It

eliminated the regime of feed-in incentives (i.e. fixed tariffs and premiums) both for new
and existing installations, and substituted a system providing for incentives by way of

“specific remuneration” based on “standard” costs per unit of installed power, plus

standard amounts for operating costs depending on the type of technology and facility.

“Specific remuneration” is defined as the amount on top of market revenue necessary to
provide the target rate of return to a standard facility during its “regulatory useful life”. It
consists of two main components: (1) an “investment incentive” calculated per MW of
installed capacity (Rinv); and (2) an “operating incentive” calculated per MWh of
electricity production (Ro). The investment incentive purports to compensate investors for
the capital cost of their investment (CAPEX), whereas the operating incentive seeks to
compensate facilities for the gap between the operating costs of a renewable energy
facility (OPEX) and the wholesale price of electricity. “Standard facilities”, on the other
hand, represent facilities that have similar characteristics (e.g., technology type, capacity,
date of installation, location, useful life, etc.), all of which receive investment and
operating incentives in accordance with the same parameters. In addition to Rinv and Ro,
other parameters, although of arguably minor relative importance, are used to establish

remunerations,?°3

RDL 9/2013 set the target rate of return at 300 points above the ten-year average yield of
Spanish Government ten-year bonds. Further details were left to be determined by

implementing decrees.

Pending such regulations, RDL 9/2013 provided for a system of “payments on account”.
Renewable energy facilities would continue to receive remuneration under RD 661/2007
as amended, but subject to “final regularization and set-off at a future undefined date”

when the new regime entered into force (Third Transitory Provision).?° In addition,

RDL 9/2013 abolished the provisions of RD 661/2007 relating to the supplement for

reactive energy but kept the related penalty.

(4) Law 24/2013

196. In December 2013, Respondent adopted Law 24/2013, which superseded Law 54/1997.
The purpose of this Law was to implement the new renewable energy framework
envisaged by RDL 9/2013. It provided that remuneration under the new renewables
support scheme should be “compatible with the economic sustainability of the electrical

[sic] system” and would:

not exceed the minimum level required to cover costs which allow
production installations from renewable energy sources [...] to
compete on an equal footing with the other technologies on the
market and which allows a reasonable return to be earned on the
installation type in each applicable case.?°°

197. Law 24/2013 also established a mechanism to have renewable energy producers finance
any tariff imbalance up to a limit of 2% for a given financial year (and 5% in terms of

. 2
accumulated imbalance),?°”

198. Between July 2013 and 31 May 2014, while the Respondent was drafting RD 413/2014
and MO IET/1045/2014, renewable producers were paid remuneration on an interim basis.
(5) RD 413/2014

199. In June 2014, Spain announced the precise terms of the new regime, when it enacted RD
413/2014 (establishing the new regime) and MO IET/1045/2014 (publishing details of the

new compensation formulas).

(6) MO IET/1045/2014

This Ministerial Order, made on 16 June 2014, set the remuneration parameters for
“standard” facilities, including the estimated “standard costs” and “regulatory useful life”
to be applied under the new regulatory regime. For purpose of identification, a standard

facility code is assigned to each eligible facility (“IT” in the Spanish acronym).

Under Annex III of MO IET/1045/2014, the “reasonable return” announced in RDL
9/2013 was set at 7.398% (pre-tax) for existing renewable energy facilities on the basis of
a predefined “regulatory useful life”, which in the case of wind facilities such as the
Claimants’ was set at 20 years. This meant that any wind farm would not receive special
remuneration after year 20 from its commissioning, but only the pool price regardless of

their costs.

Under RD 413/2014, this target return is set to apply until 31 December 2019 (i.e., until
the end of the First Regulatory Period, running from 12 July 2013 to 31 December 2019),
and it would then be subject to periodic reviews for subsequent regulatory periods of 3 to
6 years each. After the end of these periods, many of the assumptions on which the
incentives are calculated will be reviewed based on the performance of actual indicators,

including market price and the target return,?°

and the incentives may consequently be
revised up or down too. By contrast, the initial CAPEX and the regulatory useful life of

standard plants are not subject to later reviews.?

The Claimants’ installations were classified as belonging to Standard Facility IT-00652.
This corresponds to onshore wind installations with more than SMW of installed capacity
commissioned in 2002. Order IET 1045/2014 attributes to IT-00652 facilities an initial
capital expenditure (CAPEX) of EUR 94.7 million, a certain level of operating expenses,

and regulatory life of 20 years.

IT-00652 facilities are considered to have covered their estimated CAPEX (and OPEX)
and to have obtained a rate of return higher than 7.398% prior to the end of the 20-year
regulatory life.?!° To make this determination, payments received under the Special
Regime are computed. Thus, as the table below shows, these facilities do not receive an

“investment incentive” under MO IET/1045/2014. Nor do they receive an “operating

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

incentive”, because their estimated OPEX is lower than expected market revenues.”!!

revenues; they receive no subsidies.

Ministerial Order IET/1168/2014 of 3 July 2014 supplemented RDL 9/2013 and
particularly RD 413/2014 by providing that facilities formerly entitled to feed-in

year 2013 reached 8.08%, already exceeding, in its first 11 years of exploitation, the rate of reasonable rate of return
established by Order IET/1045/2014.”) Spain estimates that under the new regime the IRR of IT-00652 facilities will
be around 9.96% before taxes at the end of their regulatory life in 2023. See RWS-JRA2, para. 129.

F. SPANISH COURT DECISIONS ON THE DISPUTED MEASURES

207. From 2014 on, the Spanish Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court have issued a
series of decisions on challenges to the Disputed Measures.?!* These decisions
consistently, although not always unanimously, rejected the various claims, holding that
neither RD 661/2007 nor RD 1565/2010 promise or guarantee that the legal regime was

immune from changes by subsequent royal decrees or higher norms.

208. The Tribunal is not aware of any specific decision on Article 44 (tariff reviews) or Article
36 (the tariff rate term). It seems that the Supreme Court considered that these issues were
settled by its previous jurisprudence. With these qualifications, the legality of the Disputed

Measures overall was upheld under Spanish law, with passing reference also to EU law.

209. For instance, the Constitutional Court held in various decisions that the Disputed
Measures did not breach the Spanish principle of legislative expectations or the
prohibition against retroactivity. The Court reiterated its previous jurisprudence on the

distinction between the proscribed and permissible retroactivity of a norm. It considered

that RDL 9/2013 was not impermissibly retroactive as it “does not affect economic rights
already consolidated and definitively incorporated into the assets of the recipient, or
expired or consummated favourable legal situations.”?'4 It also stressed that the changes
were not unforeseen if one considers the growing tariff deficit, the economic crises and

the changes already introduced. For the Court:

[...] the disputed measures certainly involve a change from the
previous system, a decision that the legislature adopted as urgent in
view of the situation in which the electricity system found itself. The
change that has taken place cannot be described as unexpected, since
the changing circumstances affecting that sector of the economy,
made it necessary to make adjustments to this regulatory framework,
as a result of the difficult circumstances of the sector as a whole and
the need to guarantee the required economic balance and proper
management of the system. There are, therefore, no grounds for
arguing that changing the compensation system under review was
unforeseeable for a ‘prudent and diligent economic operator’, based
on the economic circumstances and the insufficient measures taken
to reduce persistent and continuously rising deficits in the electricity
system not sufficiently tackled with previous provisions.”!>

 

For its part, the Supreme Court found in one of the first judgments concerning an appeal
against RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014, handed down by majority on 1 June 2016

and often referred to in subsequent decisions, as follows:

[...] this Court has insisted when faced with the succession of
regulatory changes, that it was simply not possible to recognise an
‘unchangeable entitlement’ pro futuro for titleholders of facilities
for production of electricity subject to the special system, thereby
guaranteeing the unchanging nature of the remuneration framework
passed into law by the regulatory legislator. The proviso in this
regard was that prescriptive entitlements of the Electricity Sector
Act should be adhered to in relation to reasonable profitability of

investments. [...] the jurisprudence of this Court has been consistent
over the years.?!°

211. In another majority decision issued by the Supreme Court on 12 July 2016, with regard to

a challenge brought by AEE (the wind energy association), the Court held:

[...] of course there does not exist, or at least it is not invoked in the
claim, any kind of commitment or external sign, directed by the
Administrative authority to the appellants, in relation to the
immutability of the regulatory framework in place at the time when
the renewable energy production began.

Nor do we believe that the system in place at that time could alone
be deemed to be a conclusive enough external sign to generate the
legitimate expectation in the appellant; i.e. the rational and well-
founded belief that the electrical power remuneration regime that it
produced could not be altered in the future, as no provision of the
RD 661/2007, by which its facilities were protected, guaranteed that
the regulated tariff would not be subject to change.

In this regard, the jurisprudence of this Court has been constant over
the years on pointing out, in the interpretation and application of the
authorising rules of the legal and economic system applicable to
electricity production using renewable energy sources, which
guarantee the right to the reasonable rate of return on investments
made by the owners of these facilities, but do not recognise their
unalterable right to maintain the remuneration framework approved
by the holder of regulatory power unaltered [...]?!”

212. Three out of the seven judges of the Administrative Law Chamber dissented.?'* They
considered that the new system as implemented by RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014
breached the Spanish law proscription against retroactivity and the Spanish principles of

legal certainty and legitimate reliance. This was so, as one of them put it, because the new

system reduces the level of remuneration that plants are otherwise entitled to by reference
to past earnings and it “applies as if it had been in force from the very first moment that
each facility commenced its regulatory life”.?!° Two of them also opined that “Ministerial
Order IET/1045/2014, of 16 June, should have been declared void ab initio as there was
no technical justification for the values and parameters of various kinds established in that
Order as the defining values and parameters of the remuneration system for each standard

facility.”??°

G. THE TARIFF DEFICIT

213. Arelevant fact during the years of Claimants’ investments was the increasing tariff deficit,
which was publicly funded. This was exacerbated by the world financial downturn of
2008, although it was not caused by it. By 2013, the accumulated deficit was almost EUR

30 billion, as shown in the following tables published by the International Energy Agency

based on figures from the Ministry of Energy.77!

decisions on the specific subject of state aid in the renewable energy sector and on the

general issue of incompatibility of the ECT with European law.

qd) European state aid law

217. It is acknowledged by Spain that the Special Regime under Law 54/1997 was never
notified by Spain to the EC under Article 108.3 TFEU, for reasons never explained to
the Tribunal. This was despite the fact that successive EC Directives on Renewable
Energy were expressly stated to be “without prejudice to Articles 87 and 88 of the
Treaty”.725

218. In March 2001, the CJEU found in the case PreussenElektra v. Schleswag that the
obligation imposed by German Law on regional electricity distribution companies to
purchase electricity from renewable energy sources at fixed minimum prices did not

constitute state aid:

In this case, the obligation imposed on private electricity supply
undertakings to purchase electricity produced from renewable
energy sources at fixed minimum prices does not involve any direct
or indirect transfer of State resources to undertakings which produce
that type of electricity.

Therefore, the allocation of the financial burden arising from that
obligation for those private electricity supply undertakings as
between them and other private undertakings cannot constitute a
direct or indirect transfer of State resources either.

In those circumstances, the fact that the purchase obligation is
imposed by statute and confers an undeniable advantage on certain
undertakings is not capable of conferring upon it the character of
State aid within the meaning of Article 92(1) of the Treaty.?7°

219. In September of 2001, the EU issued Directive 2001/77/EC on the Promotion of

Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources in the Internal Electricity Market.

25 Directive 2001/77/EC, 27 September 2001, Art. 4, RL-0015; Directive 2009/28/EC, 23 April 2009, Art. 3.3,
RL-0017. See above, paragraph 86.

26 PreussenElektra v. Schleswag, Case C-379/98, Judgment, ECJ, 13 March 2001 (hereinafter “PreussenElektra”’),
paras. 59-61, C-0547.

84

220.

The Directive recited that public aid for renewable energy sources should be set by EU
Member States consistently with the obligations imposed in Articles 87 and 88 of the
Treaty on state aid.” The Directive obliged them to “take appropriate steps to encourage
greater consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources” in order to
“meet Kyoto targets more quickly”, and required “all Member States ... to set national
indicative targets for the consumption of electricity produced from renewable sources”,
and to report regularly to the EU on their progress in meeting those targets. Spain’s
specific indicative target was to draw 24.9% of its electricity from renewable sources by
2010. The Tribunal understands that notified schemes were generally approved by the
EC228

In April 2009, the EU issued Directive 2009/28/EC, which repealed Directive 2001/77/EC
and increased the EU’s community-wide target for total energy from renewable sources
from 12% by 2010 to 20% by 2020.7? Member States were directed to follow the
Guidelines on state aid for environmental protection and energy, approved the year
before.?*” These Guidelines provided that “the aid amount must be limited to the minimum

needed to achieve the environmental protection sought.””*! To do so:

Member States may grant operating aid to compensate for the
difference between the cost of producing energy from renewable
sources, including depreciation of extra investments for
environmental protection, and the market price of the form of energy
concerned. Operating aid may then be granted until the plant has
been fully depreciated according to normal accounting rules. Any
further energy produced by the plant will not qualify for any

227 Recital (12) of Directive 2001/77/EC, RL-0015.

»8 According to an EC report, ‘the Community Guidelines on state aid for Environmental Protection ... are rather
generous for [...] support schemes. On that basis, some 60 state aid schemes supporting renewable energy sources
were approved by the Commission during the period 2001 to 2004’: EC Communication, The support of electricity
from renewable energy sources (COM(2005) 627, para. 3.5.

assistance. However, the aid may also cover a normal return on
capital.?*?

In December 2013, the CJEU ruled in Vent de Colére! that support mechanisms financed
by consumers constitute state aid if a public body is involved in managing the funds, a
position that it reaffirmed in the 2014 Elcogds case in respect of the Spanish renewable

ime 233
energy regime.

On 10 November 2017, the EC issued a decision in which it found Spain’s new regulatory
regime to be compatible with EU state aid regulations.”** The Commission reviewed a
sample of 21 standard facilities. It observed that new “scheme replaces and supersedes the
premium economic scheme [...], which was governed by Royal Decrees 661/2007 and
1578/2008. Payments under the premium economic scheme are covered by the decision
in order to assess proportionality, i.e. the absence of overcompensation”.2* To be
proportional, according to the EC, the aid must be limited both in time (i.e. it cannot last
longer than the depreciation period of the facility) and amount; it should be restricted to

minimum required to achieve a “level playing field” °°
The EC added:

As a general comment, the Commission recalls that there is ‘no right
to State Aid’. A Member State may always decide not to grant an
aid, or to put to an end to an aid scheme [...]°°”

State grants State aid to investors, without respecting the notification

and stand-still obligation of Article 108(3) TFEU, legitimate
expectations with regard to those State aid payments are excluded.
That is because according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, a
recipient of State aid cannot, in principle, have legitimate
expectations in the lawfulness of aid that has not been notified to the
Commission.2**

[...] In an intra-EU situation, Union law is part of the applicable law,
as it constitutes international law applicable between the parties to
the dispute. As a result, based on the principle of interpretation in
conformity, the principle of fair and equitable treatment cannot have
a broader scope than the Union law notions of legal certainty and
legitimate expectations in the context of a State aid scheme. [...] This
has been expressly recognised by Arbitration Tribunals.?°?

[...] If they award compensation, such as in Eiser v Spain, or were
to do so in the future, this compensation would be notifiable State
aid pursuant to Article 108(3) TFEU and be subject to the standstill
obligation.”

(2) Compatibility of the ECT with European Union law

224. On 6 March 2018, the CJEU issued its Achmea decision. The CJEU concluded that the
arbitration clause in Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT is incompatible with

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU:

[...] Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding
a provision in an international agreement concluded between
Member States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an
investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a
dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral
tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to
accept.™"!

225.

226.

Achmea concerned the status of an UNCITRAL award in favour of Dutch Claimants
against the Slovak Republic under a BIT concluded between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, which was succeeded to by
Slovakia on independence. It did not involve the ECT. Slovakia became an EU member
in 2004. It applied to the German courts (Germany being the place of arbitration) to set
aside the award on the ground that arbitration under Article 8 of the BIT was incompatible

with EU law.
The Court held that it was incompatible, on the grounds that:

qd) In deciding a claim under the BIT, the tribunal could be required to apply EU law
“as forming part of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from

an international agreement between the Member States”.?4?

(2) The tribunal was not “situated within the judicial system of the EU” ...in that its
decisions are subject to mechanisms capable of ensuring the “full effectiveness of

EU law”.3

(3) “[A ]part from the fact that the disputes falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral
tribunal referred to in Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of
that agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those disputes to a
body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU is provided for by an
agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States”. Thus

Article 8 of the BIT “has an adverse effect on the autonomy of EU law”.?4+

(4) In the circumstances, “Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as

precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member

States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those
Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other
Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral
tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept”.”4>

The CJEU decision has been and is being followed by other decisions and developments,
which will be referred to as relevant and necessary. Two of these require specific mention

here.

(3) Vattenfall AB v. Germany, Decision on the Achmea Issue

The tribunal in Vattenfall AB v. Germany upheld its jurisdiction under the ECT

notwithstanding Achmea.

As to the applicable law, the tribunal decided that the law determining its jurisdiction is
Article 26 of the ECT in conjunction with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The
tribunal held that Article 26.6 constitutes a choice of law pursuant to Article 42.1 of the
ICSID Convention and applies to the merits only.”4” Hence, EU law is not applicable to
the jurisdiction of the tribunal. Although under Article 31.3.c VCLT any relevant rules of
international law applicable in the relations between the parties shall be taken into account,
“(ijt is not the proper role of Article 31(3)(c) VCLT to rewrite the treaty being interpreted,
or to substitute a plain reading of a treaty provision with other rules of international law,
external to the treaty being interpreted, which would contradict the ordinary meaning of
its terms.””4* Thus EU law cannot be taken into account under Article 31 VCLT to
interpret Article 26 of the ECT, as a departure from the ordinary meaning of Article 26 is

not foreseen.”””

Moreover, the tribunal rejected the EC’s contentions that (i) the relationships between the
Contracting Parties that are members of Regional Economic Integration Organisations
(“REIO”) are governed for ECT purposes by the provisions contained in the agreement
establishing the REIO; (ii) investments by investors from one EU Member State in the
area of another EU Member State are made within the “Area” of the same party; and (iii)
the EU’s offer to arbitrate is only made to investors from non-EU Member States.?°°
Articles 1.2, 1.3 and 1.10 of the ECT do not exclude intra-EU arbitrations.”>! Further, it
would have been possible to expressly exclude intra-EU arbitrations, which was envisaged
but ultimately dropped. Article 16 of the ECT confirms the tribunal’s analysis. The
ordinary meaning of Article 26.6 and Article 16 both make it clear that it is not possible
to read into Article 26 an interpretation whereby certain investors would be deprived of

their right to dispute resolution.?>

Finally, the Vattenfall tribunal analysed, albeit briefly, whether EU law prevails under a
conflict of laws analysis. It reached three conclusions: first, the rules contained in the
TFEU do not constitute a lex posterior to the ECT;2* second, the ECT has not been
modified by Germany and Spain inter se,>> and third, Article 16 of the ECT is lex specialis
to Article 351 TFEU.?%°

(4) UP and CD Holding v. Hungary

Vattenfall is to be contrasted with the decision of an ICSID tribunal in UP and CD Holding
v. Hungary, which was based on the exclusivity of jurisdiction under the ICSID
Convention. The tribunal identified three fundamental differences as between its situation

and that of the tribunal in Achmea. First, in Achmea (an UNCITRAL arbitration), the seat

 

para. 229.

90

was Frankfurt with the result that German law applied to the arbitration proceedings,
whereas the UP tribunal was a delocalised ICSID tribunal with the result that the ICSID
Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules were exclusively applicable to the proceedings.
Second, whereas in Achmea the German courts had the right to exercise judicial review of
the validity of the award, in UP judicial review was subject exclusively to the annulment
procedure under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. Thirdly, whereas in Achmea, the
German Bundesgerichtshof submitted a preliminary question to the ECJ, in UP no other

judicial review by any other court was possible.?>7

233. Hungary had argued that its accession to the EU implied its withdrawal pro tanto from the
ICSID Convention.”** But the tribunal held that, even if Hungary had actually withdrawn
from the ICSID Convention, both Article 72 of the ICSID Convention”? as well as the
survival clause in Article 12.2 of the France-Hungary BIT would have allowed UP to

maintain their claim.?°°

By communication dated 25 October 2017, the Claimants offered to clarify one of their
petitions, namely their request “for granting compensation net of taxes”. After considering
the Parties’ positions on this matter, the Tribunal decided on this matter as stated in

paragraph 42 above.

THE RESPONDENT

The Respondent requests the Tribunal in its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and
Memorial on the Jurisdiction (reiterated in its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on

Jurisdiction) to:

a) Declar[e] lack of jurisdiction for hearing the Claimants’
claims or, if applicable, their inadmissibility, pursuant to that laid
down in the Memorials of Jurisdictional Objections and Reply to
the Jurisdictional Objections;

b) Secondarily in the event that the Arbitration Tribunal were
to decide that it has jurisdiction to hear the present dispute, that it
should reject all the claims of the Claimants on the merits, since the
Kingdom of Spain has not breached in any way, the ECT, in
accordance with what is set forth in sections IT and III of the present
Writ;

c) Secondarily, dismiss all of the Claimants’ compensatory
claims, as the Claimants have no right to compensation, pursuant to
that stated in section IV herein; and

240.

d) It condemns the Claimants to pay all costs and expenses
derived from this arbitration, including ICSID administrative
expenses, arbitrators’ fees, and the arbitrators’ fees and the fees
of the legal representatives of the Kingdom of Spain, their experts
and advisors, as well as any other cost or expense that has been
incurred, all of this including a reasonable rate of interest from the
date on which these costs are incurred and the date of their actual
payment.

JURISDICTION

The Respondent contests the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on two grounds, one general, one
specific. First, it denies that the ECT applies as between EU Member States; as a corollary
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction with respect to claims under the ECT brought by German
investors against Spain. Secondly, even if the Tribunal has jurisdiction with respect to
some of the Disputed Measures, this does not extend to Law 15/2012 imposing the

TVPEE, which is specifically excluded as a taxation measure by Article 21 of the ECT.

THE INTRA-EU OBJECTION
wD The Respondent’s Position

According to Spain, under the principle of primacy, EU Law puts aside the application of
any other regulation in issues arising between EU Member States and their citizens.?°!
Further, Spain argues that investment treaties between EU Member States are
incompatible with EU law.?® Spain points out that the Claimants are EU national
investors, and that as such they are granted particular protection which is preferential to

that provided for by the ECT and by any BIT.?® Since this is an intra-EU dispute,” Spain

argues that EU law is the international law applicable for the resolution of the dispute,”

and that the ECT has no application in intra-EU disputes.

(2) The Claimants’ Position

241. For the Claimants, Articles 26.6 of the ECT and 42.1 of the ICSID Convention are the
provisions determining the law that the Tribunal must apply to the merits of the dispute.
Article 42.1 of the ICSID Convention provides that the Tribunal “shall decide a dispute
in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.” Article 26.6 of the
ECT requires the Tribunal to apply “this Treaty [ECT] and applicable rules and principles

of international law.”?°°

242. EU Law is part and parcel of Spanish law and is, therefore, subordinate to international
law, which must prevail.?6’ The regulations and decisions issued by EU bodies are not
“international law”. They are simple facts, which cannot override Spain’s international
law obligations and commitments. In this regard, the “CJEU is no more no less than the
supreme court of a Contracting Party”.?°

243. Even if one were to accept the proposition that EU law could be considered as applicable
international law, rather than a fact, the application of EU law would be subordinated to

the ECT by virtue of Article 16 of the ECT.2?

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

244. Before Achmea, the intra-EU objection had been repeatedly raised before investment

tribunals, both in the context of the ECT and of intra-EU BITs, and repeatedly rejected.?”

It was equally rejected, for detailed reasons given, by Advocate-General Wathelet in
Achmea.2”' It was however accepted by the CJEU in that case, leading this Tribunal to
order further written and oral briefing as described in paragraphs 49, 50, 51, 55, 57, and
58 above.

245. On analysis, the intra-EU objection raises two distinct questions. The first is whether the
ECT had inter se application prior to the adoption of the TFEU. The second is whether
the TFEU changed anything in this regard. Since the CJEU in Achmea relied on the TFEU

as the basis for its conclusion, it is principally relevant to the second issue.

(a) The original scope of the ECT

246. Spain argues that that when the ECT was signed, the Member States of the European
Community were unable to contract obligations between them regarding the Internal

Market and that this is why the EU is a contracting party to the ECT.?”

247. Onits face there is nothing in the text of the ECT that carves out or excludes issues arising

between EU Member States.

contained in [the European Energy Charter] on a secure and binding international
legal basis.” This implies that the scope of the (non-binding) European Energy
Charter of 17 December 1991 was replicated in binding form in the ECT. There is
no indication of any inter se exclusion in the Charter, which refers to a “new desire
for a European-wide and global co-operation based on mutual respect and
confidence,” and further refers to the “support from the European Community,
particularly through completion of its internal energy market”.?”> The EC and
Euratom were signatories to the Charter. This was of course before the Treaty of

Maastricht, let alone the Lisbon Treaty.

Article 1.2 of the ECT defines “Contracting Party” as “a state or Regional
Economic Integration Organization which has consented to be bound by this
Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.” In accordance with this definition,
EU Member States and the EU are all Contracting Parties. Prima facie at least, a
treaty applies equally between its parties. It would take an express provision or

clear understanding between the negotiating parties to achieve another result.
There is no such express provision (or ‘disconnection clause’) in the ECT.2”*

While it is not permissible in a context in which the terms of the treaty are clear to

275

rely on preparatory works,~’° it is worth mentioning that the travaux préparatoires

seem to point against implying a disconnection clause: one was proposed during

the course of the negotiations for the ECT, but was not adopted.?”°

Spain states that EU Member States have transferred competence over certain matters in
an irrevocable and binding way to the EU and that part of the matters comprised by the
ECT are exclusively upon decided by the EU;?” it quotes the voting rules applicable to a
REIO.?’* However, there is nothing in the text to support this argument. The mere fact
that the EU is party to the ECT does not entail that EU Member States did not have
competence to enter into inter se obligations in the Treaty. Instead, the ECT seems to
contemplate that there would be overlapping competences. The term REIO is defined in
Article 1.3 of the ECT to mean an “organization constituted by states to which they have
transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this
Treaty, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those
matters.” The Area of the REIO is also defined by Article 1.10 with reference to EU law.
But nothing in Article 1, nor any other provision in the ECT, suggests that the EU Member
States had then transferred exclusive competence over all matters of investment and

dispute resolution to the EU.

Pursuant to Article 6 of the VCLT, every State possesses capacity to conclude treaties and
is bound by those obligations pursuant to the principle of pacta sunt servanda. No
limitation on the competence of the EU Member States was communicated at the time that
the ECT was signed. Article 46 of the VCLT provides that a State may not invoke
provisions of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties to invalidate a
treaty unless it was a manifest violation of a rule of fundamental importance. While EU
law operates on both the internal and international plane, a similar principle must apply.
Even if, as a matter of EC law, the EC then had exclusive competence over matters of
internal investment, the fact is that Member States to the EU signed the ECT without
qualification or reservation. The inter se obligations in the ECT are not somehow invalid

or inapplicable because of an allocation of competence that Spain argues can be inferred

for the European Energy Charter, 12 August 1992, para. 27.18. The Parties discussed the existence (or lack of) a
disconnection clause in their filings. See Resp. Rej., paras, 74-83.

from a set of (mostly later) EU laws and regulations dealing with investment. The more
likely explanation, which is consistent with the text of the ECT, is that, at the time the

ECT was signed, the competence was a shared one.

Spain argues that there is no diversity of territory among the investors and the host State
as required by Article 26 of the ECT, since both are part of the same “Contracting Party”
for ECT purposes.” According to Spain the ECT would only apply to a dispute between
an investor from a third party country which is a signatory to the ECT and an EU Member
State.?®° But if, as the Tribunal considers, the Member States were Contracting Parties to
the ECT in their own right, there is no difficulty in applying Article 26 severally to them

in matters concerning their own territory and responsibility.

For these reasons the Tribunal holds that the ECT had inter se application prior to the

TFEU. The question is whether this position has changed since the adoption of the TFEU.

(b) Subsequent EU Treaties and Decisions

(i) The Respondent's position

The Respondent argues that, even if the ECT had originally applied inter se, this changed
in 2007 with the Treaty of Lisbon.”*! In its view this Treaty “expressly speaks in favour
of EU jurisdiction in matters of foreign investments” and overrides the ECT by virtue of
the /ex posterior rule in Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT,?*? whereby “successive treaties
relating to the same subject matter” will prevail over the earlier to the extent that the

treaties are not compatible.

Turning first to the substantive investment obligations, Spain argues that these are

incompatible with the investment rights protected under European law. Spain points to the

tules establishing the European internal market, with free movement of goods, persons,
services and capital.?** Spain states that discriminatory measures are not permitted under

European law.?**

As far as concerns dispute resolution, the Respondent argues that the dispute resolution
clause, Article 26 of the ECT, prevents an intra-EU investor from bringing arbitration
proceedings against an EU Member State regarding its investment, and that the clause is
itself incompatible with Article 344 of the TFEU,”* which provides that “Member States
undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the

Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.”

Respondent also says that under Article 16 of the ECT’s rules for compatibility between
previous and subsequent treaties and the ECT, treaties that regulate the EU prevail over

the ECT in intra-EU relations.”*°

The Respondent argues that EU law must be applied by the Tribunal in accordance with
Article 26.6 of the ECT as “international law”. EU law is also part of the laws of Spain

and a relevant fact for deciding the dispute.?*”

Moreover, the core of the dispute in this case revolves around issues of state aid. Public
subsidies are the largest component of feed-in tariffs. This is a matter regulated by EU
law, which is thus decisive in determining the scope of investors’ rights under the

regulatory framework of renewable energies in Spain.

EU Law is not confined to the treaties between EU Member States. It also includes the
relevant legal acts of EU institutions such as regulations, directives and decisions as

provided for by Article 288 TFEU.?**

(ii) The Claimants’ position

For the Claimants, Articles 26.6 of the ECT and 42.1 of the ICSID Convention are the
provisions determining the law that the Tribunal must apply to the merits of the dispute.
Article 42.1 of the ICSID Convention provides that the Tribunal “shall decide a dispute
in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.” Article 26.6 of the
ECT requires the Tribunal to apply “this Treaty [ECT] and applicable rules and principles

of international law.”?°°

EU Law is part and parcel of Spanish law and is, therefore, subordinate to international
law, which must prevail.?° The regulations and decisions issued by EU bodies are not
“international law”. They are simple facts, which cannot override Spain’s international
law obligations commitments. In this regard, the “CJEU is no more no less than the

supreme court of a Contracting Party”.??!

Even if one were to accept the proposition that EU law could be considered as applicable
international law, rather than a fact, the application of EU law would be subordinated to

the ECT by virtue of Article 16 of the ECT.?

(4) Conclusions

The Tribunal begins by observing that the source of its competence is the ECT, a valid
multilateral treaty to which all EU Member States and the EU itself are parties and which

is governed by international law. Specifically, Article 26 defines the jurisdiction of the

Tribunal, which (as already held) had inter se application when it was concluded. Whether
that jurisdiction was excluded by subsequent developments at the European Union level

depends on the rules of international law as to the relations between successive treaties.
The starting point is Article 26.6 of the ECT, which provides:

A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and
principles of international law.

In Vattenfall v. Germany, the tribunal held that:

[...] Article 26(6) ECT, either viewed through Article 42(1) ICSID
Convention or interpreted independently of the ICSID Convention,
applies only to the merits of a dispute between the Parties. It does
not apply to issues or questions relating to the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. For this reason, Respondent’s argument that Article
26(6) brings EU law and the ECJ Judgment into application in the
context of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction must fail.?%°

But what the Vattenfail tribunal excluded via the front door of Article 26.6, it substantially
brought back in as treaty law independently of Article 26.6. It did so in two key respects.
First it went on to say that it had to apply “the principles of international law relating to
treaty interpretation, application, and other aspects of treaties, which render the ECT
workable. They are reflected in the VCLT, and provide the framework through which all
treaties are interpreted and applied”. Secondly, it agreed with the Electrabel tribunal
that EU law is part of international law “because it is rooted in international treaties”.?°>

It went on to qualify that conclusion to some extent in the following passage:

[...] It would be more exact to say that the corpus of EU law derives
from treaties that are themselves a part of, and governed by,

283 Vattenfall AB v. Germany (Decision on Achmea), para. 121, CL-0236.

international law, and contains other rules that are applicable on the
plane of international law, while also containing rules that operate
only within the internal legal order of the EU and, at least arguably,
are not a part of international law; but for present purposes the
Electrabel formula suffices.?°°

The present Tribunal does not need to explore the putative “internal legal order” exception
raised in this passage. It is clear that the provisions of European law relied on by the
Respondent and by the Court in Achmea — such as Articles 107, 108, 267 and 344 TFEU

— apply as treaty provisions between the EU and its member states and do not pertain just

to “the internal legal order of the EU”.2”

To summarise the Tribunal’s view, Article 26.6 is itself part of the ECT, which is governed
by international law. Article 26.6 is an unexceptionable provision, which would have had
to be implied if it had not been expressed. What other rules than those in the ECT and the
surrounding rules of international law relating to the jurisdiction of tribunals and the
content and interpretation of treaties would be applicable if Article 26.6 were to be given
a restrictive interpretation? Whatever route one takes to the applicable law, the result is

effectively the same.

The question then becomes what the ECT and relevant rules of international law have to

say about the application of EU law.

That matter is regulated in the first instance by Article 16 of the ECT (“Relation to Other
Agreements”), which provides:
Where two or more Contracting Parties [...] enter into a subsequent

international agreement, whose terms [...] concern the subject
matter of Part III or V of this Treaty [...]

27 Cf the ICJ’s discussion of the “Constitutional Framework” for Kosovo as international law in Unilateral
Declarations of Independence, ICJ Reports 2010 p. 403 at 439-442 (paras. 88-93).

104

270.

271.

272.

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed
to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or from
any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under this Treaty,
where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or
Investment.

By implication this gives priority to Parts III and V of the ECT where two conditions are
met: (1) the other treaty (here the TFEU) is one whose terms concern the subject matter

of Part III or V, and (2) the other treaty is less favourable to the investor or the investment.

The Tribunal would be inclined, if necessary, to hold that the second condition is met here,
in that Article 10 of the ECT, in conjunction with Part V, is more favourable to the Investor
or the Investment.?°* Nothing in the TFEU allows a direct challenge by an Investor to a
State measure harmful to it on grounds specified in Article 10, or on more favourable
grounds. Nor does the TFEU provide for an international tribunal to decide disputes
directly between investors and host States, as Part V of the ECT does. However, the first
condition is in the Tribunal’s view not met, because the TFEU is not an international
agreement concerning the subject matter of Part III or V of the ECT.” Article 16 therefore

does not resolve potential conflicts between the TFEU and the ECT.

In argument Spain relied on Article 30 VCLT as resolving that conflict, but it does not do
so. Article 30 is entitled “Application of Successive Treaties relating to the same Subject-

matter”. In relevant part it provides:

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later
treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent
that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties
to the earlier one:

2°8 Cf Vattenfall AB v. Germany (Decision on Achmea), para. 194, CL-0236.
2 Td.

105

273.

274.

(a) As between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies
as in paragraph 3;

(b) As between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only
one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs
their mutual rights and obligations.

5. Paragraph 4 is without prejudice to article 41, or to any question
of the termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty under
article 60 or to any question of responsibility which may arise for a
State from the conclusion or application of a treaty the provisions of
which are incompatible with its obligations towards another State
under another treaty.

Article 30 is only concerned with successive treaties relating to the same subject matter
(see Article 30.1) whereas, as already noted, the TFEU is not a treaty related to the same
subject matter as the ECT. Even if it were, the /ex posterior rule, which is stated in Article
3.3.a and which gives priority to the later treaty to which both states are parties, is
inapplicable here.*” When it is applied to cases where the parties negotiating the later
treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one, Article 3.3.a is without prejudice to
Article 41 or to any questions of responsibility which may arise from the coexistence of
incompatible treaties: see Article 30.5. This makes it clear that even on an inter se basis,

questions of responsibility may arise.

The relevant provision is thus Article 41 VCLT, entitled “Agreement to modify
multilateral treaties between certain of the parties only”.*”! It is also the salient provision,
because the position taken by Spain (on the assumption that, as the Tribunal has found,
the ECT originally had inter se application within the EU both as to substance (Part III of
the ECT) and procedure (Part V of the ECT) is that the parties to the TFEU thereby

excluded the ECT as between themselves.

Article 41 VCLT provides:

1. Two or more of the parties to a multilateral treaty may conclude
an agreement to modify the treaty as between themselves alone if:

(a) The possibility of such a modification is provided for by the
treaty; or

(b) The modification in question is not prohibited by the treaty and:

(i) Does not affect the enjoyment by the other parties of their rights
under the treaty or the performance of their obligations;

(ii) Does not relate to a provision, derogation from which is
incompatible with the effective execution of the object and purpose
of the treaty as a whole.

2. Unless in a case falling under paragraph 1(a) the treaty otherwise
provides, the parties in question shall notify the other parties of their
intention to conclude the agreement and of the modification to the
treaty for which it provides.

It should be noted that, unlike Article 16 of the ECT or Article 30 of the VCLT, Article
Al is not limited to treaties having the same subject matter. A priori, it is capable of
applying to the abrogation inter se by the TFEU of the ECT, provided the conditions laid
down by Article 41, to the extent that they reflect the customary international law of treaty
modification, have been met. But in the Tribunal’s view, there are two ways in which they
have not been met. First, it is not suggested that the parties to the TFEU notified the other
parties of the intended modification to the ECT. Secondly, it is very doubtful whether the
abrogation inter se of the ECT as between EU Member States is compatible “with the
effective execution of the object and purpose of the [ECT] as a whole”. Article 16 of the

ECT suggests that it is not, since it evinces an intent, even as between treaties on the same

107

277.

278.

subject matter, to preserve the rights of investors and investments, which constitute a

major plank of that multilateral treaty.*°?

This interpretation finds support in the ILC’s commentary to Article 41. The commentary
to draft article 37 (adopted without material change as Article 41) distinguishes sharply
between inter se modifications and amendments to a multilateral treaty in which all parties

to the treaty are involved (the latter dealt with in Article 40 VCLT):

Clearly, a transaction in which two or a small group of parties set
out to modify the treaty between themselves alone without giving
the other parties the option of participating in it is on a different
footing from an amending agreement drawn up between the parties
generally, even if ultimately they do not all ratify it. For an inter se
agreement is more likely to have an aim and effect incompatible
with the object and purpose of the treaty.*”

As to the procedural condition laid down in Article 41.2 VCLT, the commentary stresses
its importance as a means of notifying states parties to the prior treaty of the intention to
modify it, and thus supports the conclusion that the requirement reflects general

international law:

Paragraph 2 seeks to add a further protection to the parties against
illegitimate modifications of the treaty by some of the parties
through an inter se agreement by requiring them to notify the other
parties in advance of their intention to conclude the agreement and
of the modifications for which it provides.**

32 To similar effect Vattenfall AB v. Germany (Decision on Achmea), para. 229, CL-0236.

281.

Article 41.2 is thus a corollary of the principle expressed in Article 40.2 which protects
the right of existing parties to multilateral treaties to be involved in their amendment or

modification.*°>

For these reasons, the Tribunal, if it were free to do so, would hold that under international
law the TFEU did not modify inter se the provisions of the ECT, either as to substance
(Part III, notably Article 10) or as to jurisdiction (Part V, notably Article 26). The question
is whether the CJEU’s decision in Achmea compels the contrary conclusion. For just as
the European treaties are part of international law, so the CJEU, which exercises
jurisdiction as between EU Member States, is an international court whose decisions are
binding on those states inter se. International law allows the states parties to a regime
treaty to establish their own international courts with jurisdiction over and authority to
bind the Member States on issues of international law affecting them. It also allows those
States to establish the priority of the regime treaty over other sources of international law,

at least so long as peremptory norms are not implicated.>°°
As noted in paragraph 224 above, the CJEU held in Achmea that:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from
one of those Member States may, in the event of dispute concerning
investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against
the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction
that Member State has undertaken to accept.”

3° For the view that the relevant articles, which were adopted without opposition at the Vienna Conference, reflect
general international law see ME Villiger, Commentary on the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (2009) 516
(Art. 39), 526 (Art. 38), 538 (Art. 41). But the doctrine is divided.

306 See Art. 53 VCLT, RL-0010. A group of states could no more authorize a court established by them to override a

peremptory norm than they could authorize it themselves. But no

 

e of the application of peremptory norms arises

here, nor any issue of the application of Art. 103 of the United Nations Charter: cf Art. 30.1 VCLT.
307 Achmea, para. 60, RL-O111.

285.

Tf this dictum were to be applied to the ECT, it would authoritatively establish, as between
Germany and Spain, that the TFEU modifies Article 16 of the ECT on an inter se basis.
But the CJEU in Achmea was considering a bilateral treaty “concluded between Member
States”, not a multilateral treaty such as the ECT. Secondly, the CJEU was discussing “an

>> 308

agreement which was concluded not by the EU but by Member States’ whereas the

ECT was concluded also by the EU and its terms are opposable to the EU.*?

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that its jurisdiction is not pre-empted by the
Achmea decision. This conclusion does not mean that European law, in particular state aid
law, is irrelevant to the merits of the present dispute. Its relevance and impact will be

discussed in due course.

THE TAXATION CLAIM
qd) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine whether the 7%
tax on the value of electric energy production introduced by Law 15/2012 constitutes a
breach of Spain’s obligations under Article 10.1 of the ECT, since the TVPEE is a taxation

measure exempt from the ECT by means of the carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT.*'°

The Respondent argues that it has not consented to submit to arbitration the resolution of
disputes deriving from tax measures as the TVPEE. Pursuant to Article 26.3 of the ECT,
Spain consented only to submit to arbitration disputes arising out of alleged breaches of
Part III of the ECT. While Article 10.1 of the ECT is included in Part III, the TVWPEE —
whose introduction allegedly breaches Spain’s obligations under Article 10.1 — is a
taxation measure exempt from the scope of protection of Article 10.1 by virtue of Article

21.1 of the ECT, which provides that “nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose

obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties”. Article 21.5
then reapplies Article 13 to taxation measures, subject to a process of preliminary referral
to “the relevant Competent Tax Authority”, a matter to which the Tribunal will return.

But Article 10.1 is not reapplied.

The Respondent maintains that the TVPEE is a ‘Taxation Measure’ as defined by Article
21.7.a.i of the ECT. In accordance with this definition, the TVPEE is a domestic law of
Spain, enacted by the Spanish Parliament in accordance with the relevant procedures

under Spanish law,*!! and is recognized as a tax under Spanish and international law.?!?

Besides, contrary to Claimants’ argument,?!? the TVPEE is a bona fide taxation measure.
It is a tax of general application to renewable and conventional energy producers, which
are granted the same treatment without according tax benefits to renewable energy
procedures not accorded to others.*'+ The Constitutional Court of Spain confirmed the
legislator’s right to enact the TVPEE, dismissing the appeal brought by the Government

of Andalusia against the alleged unconstitutionality of Law 15/2012.3!°

Spain further argues that, in the case Yukos v. Russia,>'® referenced by the Claimants as

examples of non-bona fide taxes,*'"

the taxation measures imposed pursued a purpose
entirely unrelated to that of obtaining revenue for the State, such as the destruction of a
company and the elimination of a political opponent. Such extraordinary circumstances

are not present here.*!8

In addition, the economic effects of the TVPEE on producers of renewable energy is
neutralized, as renewable energy producers subject to the payment of the TVPEE receive
a special remuneration to recover the costs of the TVPEE, which, unlike conventional
producers, they cannot recover in the market, thereby allowing a reasonable return and

putting them on equal footing with conventional energy producers.*!°

Also, the purpose of the TVPEE is to raise revenue for Spain and contribute to the State
resources that finance public expenses. The revenues from the TVPEE are accounted in
Spain’s annual General Budget; it is not a disguised tariff cut targeting producers of

renewable energy.”

Finally, the Respondent refers to the arbitral jurisprudence of Isolux v. Spain **! where the
tribunal declared that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the claim for alleged breach of Article

10.1 of the ECT through the introduction of the TVPEE by Law 15/2012.*?7

(2) The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that the carve-out of Article 21.1 of the ECT only applies to taxation

measures that are bona fide, i.e. not actions disguised as a tax but aiming at achieving a

different purpose.*?? In this regard, the tribunal in Yukos decided that the tax carve-out

does not apply to measures that are carried out under the guise of taxation and that have

another objective than raising revenue for the State.*”4

Furthermore, the Claimants explains that the TVPEE established by Law 15/2012 is, in
its view, not a bona fide tax; instead it is a disguised requirement that the producers of

renewable energy reimburse Spain for the tariff deficit.7?°

The Claimants maintain that even the Spanish Government explained that the real purpose
of the TVPEE “was to slash the remuneration guaranteed by RD 661/2007 to Special

Regime producers to reduce the tariff deficit”.*”°

Moreover, the Claimants contend that the arguments of the claimants in Jsolux v. Spain
are not the same as those used by the Claimants in this arbitration. This is for two reasons.
First, in /solux, the claimants argued that the TVPEE was not a bona fide tax because “(1)
there was a contradiction between the environmental purpose that Act 15/2012 assigns to
the TVPEE and its true purpose, to reduce the tariff deficit; and (2) the TVPEE
discriminated photovoltaic producers”.*”’ As to these arguments, the tribunal decided that
only because there is a contradiction between the TVPEE’s theoretical environmental
purpose and its real one, does not render the TVPEE mala fide* Second, the claimants
in Isolux failed to observe that even if the TVPEE were considered a tax for the purposes
of Article 21 of the ECT, it would fall under the terms of a tax “other than those on income
or on capital”.*”? This is because the TVPEE imposes a charge on “gross revenues”, which

is not included in the definition of “income” under Article 21 of the ECT. *°°

The Claimants also argue that they are entitled to MFN treatment pursuant to Article 10.7
of the ECT in connection with the Respondent’s taxation of foreign investments. Article
10.7 of the ECT requires the Respondent to provide MEN treatment to German investors

in the Spanish energy sector. In other investment treaties, the Respondent has agreed to

observe also in relation to taxation measures the standard range of investment protections
(umbrella clause, fair and equitable treatment, constant protection and security and non-
impairment). Thus, the Claimants are entitled to the same investment protection in relation

to the TVPEE by virtue of Articles 21.3 and 10.7 of the ECT.**!

(3) The Tribunal’s Analysis

In agreement with all other tribunals which have faced this issue, the Tribunal holds that
the TVPEE is a taxation measure excluded from its jurisdiction under Article 10.1 of the

ECT by Article 21.1 of the ECT, which provides:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this
Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to
Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the
Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.**”

The term “taxation measure” is not defined in the ECT, although Article 21.7.a includes
“any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a
political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein” as well as “any provision relating
to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other

international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the term “taxation measure” should be given its normal meaning

in the context of the ECT. According to the tribunal in EnCana v. Ecuador:

The question whether something is a tax measure is primarily a
question of its legal operation, not its economic effect. A taxation
law is one which imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay
money to the State for public purposes. The economic impacts or
effects of tax measures may be unclear and debatable; nonetheless a
measure is a taxation measure if it is part of the regime for the
imposition of a tax. A measure providing relief from taxation is a

302.

taxation measure just as much as a measure imposing the tax in the
first place.***

The tribunal was interpreting the term “tax measure” in a BIT, but there seems no reason
not to apply its definition here. For the purposes of Article 21.1 of the ECT, it suffices to
demonstrate that the TVPEE constitutes a tax, i.e. a compulsory exaction of money by law

for public purposes.

Prima facie, the TVPEE is a tax. It was upheld as such by the Spanish courts. The Spanish
High Court dismissed a challenge to Ministerial Order HAP/703/2013 of April 2013,3*4
which approved Form 583 by which taxpayers self-assess and pay the TVPEE to the

Spanish Treasury. The High Court declared the Order lawful.?*

Second, the
Constitutional Court on 6 November 2014?*° dismissed a claim that Articles 4, 5 and 8 of
the TVPEE were unconstitutional.**” The Court ruled that “the challenged provisions do
not exceed the freedom of configuration of the legislator, who is in no way prevented from

employing taxation [...]”*** and referred to the TVPEE as “the tax in question” .**?

As to the second limb of the definition of the term “taxation measure”, namely whether
the TVPEE constitutes a compulsory exaction of money by law for public purposes, this
Tribunal agrees with the tribunal’s conclusion in Isolux v. Spain.*4° The TVPEE was
collected by the Spanish State and was compulsory for all producers of electric energy for
the purpose of raising funds for the State. The objective of Law 15/2012 was to address

the efficient production of energy that respects the environment and sustainability.*4! On

its face, the TVPEE constitutes a compulsory exaction of money by law for public

purposes.

In the Claimants’ view, however, for a taxation measure to fall within Article 21.1 of the
ECT it must have been enacted in good faith. This additional bona fide test was applied
by the tribunals in Yukos v. Russia and in Hulley v. Russia. In Yukos the tribunal found

that:

[...] the carve-out of Article 21 (1) can apply only to bona fide
taxation actions, i.e. actions that are motivated by the purpose of
raising general revenue for the State. By contrast, actions that are
taken only under the guise of taxation, but in reality aim to achieve
an entirely unrelated purpose (such as the destruction of a company
or the elimination of a political opponent) cannot qualify for
exemption from the protection standard of the ECT under the
taxation carve-out in Article 21(1).*?

The Yukos tribunal, like the tribunal in Hulley, distinguished between bona fide measures

and measures aimed at destroying a company or political opponent.*¥

The Tribunal is not confronted with a similar scenario. There is no evidence that Spain
intended to destroy the Claimants by means of the TVPEE. As stated by the tribunal in
Isolux v. Spain, the “economic repercussions or effects of the [T]VPEE may be obscure
and debatable, but that does not constitute a sufficient argument to conclude that the

[T]VPEE is a tax measure that was promulgated in bad faith.”*4+

In Eiser v. Spain the tribunal did not decide whether there is a bad faith exception to Article
21.1: it held that the bad faith allegation “could be maintained only if Spain knew or

should have known that the RD 661/2007 tariffs cannot be substantially altered, and so

knowingly violated its obligations under the ECT by adopting Law 15/2012. The evidence
is not sufficient to sustain this contention.”**° Likewise in the present case: there was a
concern as to the burgeoning tariff deficit, but it was a legitimate concern and it was

reasonable that the energy sector as a whole should bear at least part of the fiscal burden.

The decision in Antaris v. Czech Republic is not inconsistent with this conclusion. There
the tribunal held that a levy chargeable only on the recipients of subsidies and collected
by way of an offset against subsidy entitlements was not a tax. The decision on that point
is distinguishable inter alia on the basis that the Czech Supreme Administrative Court
found that the “Solar Levy is not a tax for the purposes of the prohibition against double

taxation under Czech law”*4’. The levy’s avowed purpose was to reduce the feed-in tariffs

for certain investors and not to raise revenue for the State budget.*#*

By contrast the Spanish Constitutional Court in its decision of 4 December 2014 upheld
the TVPEE on the ground that:

[...] the challenged provisions do not exceed the freedom of
configuration of the legislator, who is in no way prevented from
employing taxation as an economic policy instrument in particular
sectors ... which means for ordinance or extra-fiscal purposes ...
The widespread application of the tax in question responds to an
option open to the legislator, who while respecting constitutional
principles, has a broad margin for establishing and setting up the tax.
This margin cannot be constrained by demands for a differentiation
that is not constitutionally obligatory, however much the appellant
feels this is appropriate or necessary, nor by expectations of the
maintenance of the pre-existing tax scheme — which in itself, would
prevent any kind of legislative innovation.*“?

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the TVPEE constitutes a taxation measure for
the purposes of Article 21.1 and the claim falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction insofar

as it involves an alleged breach of Article 10.1 of the ECT.

The Claimants seek to avoid the exclusionary consequences of classifying the TVPEE as
a “taxation measure” by relying on Article 21.3 of the ECT, which provides that, with
certain irrelevant exceptions, “Article 10(2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures...
other than those on income or on capital”. Article 10.7 contains an MFN provision under
which the Claimants may invoke other international investment treaties to which Spain is
a party. These agreements contain the standard range of investment protections, including
umbrella clauses, fair and equitable treatment provisions and constant protection and
security and non-impairment provisions. Thus, the Claimants argue, Article 21.3 lets in
by the back door the protections excluded by Article 21.1 in relation to “Taxation

Measures”.>°°

But it only does so if the TVPEE is not a “tax measure on income or on capital”. Article

21.7.b of the ECT defines this term broadly as:

[...] all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital or on
elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains from the
alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances and gifts, or
substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total amounts of wages or
salaries paid by enterprises, as well as taxes on capital appreciation.

The question is then whether the TVPEE is a “tax measure on income or on capital”. In
which case the MFN clause in Article 10.7 would not apply. According to the KPMG
Expert Witness Report, Law 15/2012 introduced a 7% tax on the “total revenue... for the

production and incorporation of energy into the electricity system.”*>! The term “total

income” used in Article 21.7.b can be equated to the term “total revenue” used by the

380 See above, paragraph 292.
31 KPMG First Regulatory Report, para. 243, CER-0001.

315.

Claimants’ experts. Even if the two terms are not co-extensive, Article 21.7.b states that
taxes imposed on “elements of income” also constitute tax measures on income or on
capital. If “total revenue” does not constitute the “total income” it undoubtedly constitutes

“elements of income”.

Article 6 of Law 15/2012 states that the “tax base” is the “total amount that is to be
received by the taxpayer”.*>? Further, the “calculation of the total amount will take into
account the remuneration [...]”. The tax is therefore imposed at least on “elements of

income”.

As a result, the TVPEE is a tax on income in the sense of Article 21.7.b of the ECT.
Consequently, the Claimants cannot invoke any other protection standards by means of
the MEN clause in Article 10.7 of the ECT. This further basis of claim must also fail.

THE MERITS OF THE CLAIM

INTRODUCTION

The Claimants allege five causes of action arising under the ECT:

(a) indirect expropriation (Art. 13 of the ECT);

(b) breach of the umbrella clause (Art. 10(1) of the ECT, last sentence);

(c) breach of fair and equitable treatment (Art. 10(1) of the ECT, second sentence);

(d) breach of the obligation of most constant protection (Art. 10(1) of the ECT, third

sentence);

316.

318.

(e) impairment of the investment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures (Art.

10(1) of the ECT, third sentence).

Before turning to the merits of these claims, insofar as they fall within the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, it is relevant to observe that a large number of parallel claims have been filed
against the Respondent arising out of the Disputed Measures, producing somewhat

discrepant results.

As a general matter, investment tribunals (like other international tribunals) are not bound
by a strict doctrine of precedent, but are charged to make their own appreciations based
on the evidence and argument presented to them. On the other hand, in practice tribunals
regularly cite previous, publicly available awards and pay careful attention to them. In the
Tribunal’s view, concordant decisions on the interpretation and application of the ECT
are entitled to respect, especially if they rise to the level of a jurisprudence constante. On
the other hand, where they diverge, a later tribunal has no choice but to form its own view

of the relevant law and its application to the facts. This the Tribunal has done.

OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

This section sets out the Parties’ positions regarding (a) the evolution of the regulatory
framework for renewable energies in Spain; (b) the scope and legal effect (if any) of the
2010 Agreement; (c) the approval of the new remuneration regime; (d) the impact of the
Disputed Measures on the Wind Farms; and (e) Claimants’ asserted expectations. Section
VI(C) below addresses the claims submitted under the ECT and the arguments of the

Parties in relation thereto.

wD Claimants’ positions
(a) The evolution of the regulatory framework

According to the Claimants, Spain committed under EU law and other international
instruments to ambitious renewable energy targets.*>* To meet such targets, it put in place
a system of feed-in incentives specifically designed to induce “qualifying investors” to
invest in Spain? and to facilitate their access to project finance.*° This system, which
was promoted by Government officials overseas to attract foreign investment from various
countries including Germany (home State of the Claimants) guaranteed, among others, “a
price per kWh of electricity produced during lifetime of their RES installations (FiT or

FiP)”**°, a right that “ran with the installation, benefitting subsequent investors”.*°”

According to the Claimants, Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 granted Special Regime
producers a general entitlement to a premium (i.e. remuneration “shall” be supplemented
by a premium).*** Successive regulations gave content to this entitlement by establishing
specific rights, which were meant to be permanent and to remain stable over time. As set
out in RD 661/2007, these rights included: (i) to choose on an annual basis between
Regulated Tariff or the Pool Price plus a Premium Option; (ii) to sell under both options
the full net amount of the electricity produced; (iii) to receive the Feed-in remuneration
scheme for an unlimited period of time, thus including the entire lifespan of the Wind
Farms; (iv) to receive a Feed-in remuneration scheme in which Tariffs, Premiums and
upper and lower limits had to be annually updated in accordance with the general CPI less
0.25% until the end of 2012 and less 0.50% onwards; (v) to priority access to the
transmission and distribution grid and energy dispatch priority; and, (vi) to receive,

regardless of the sale option elected under Article 24.1 of RD 661/2007, a Supplement for

Reactive Energy for the maintenance of certain stipulated power factor values, which was

established at 0.082954 EUR/kWh.*>?

According to the Claimants, only “qualifying renewable energy producers who managed
to successfully build, commission and register their installation in RAIPRE and
contributed to the objectives set out in the Renewable Promotion Plans, were entitled to
the FiTs and FiPs guaranteed in the Feed-in Regulations.”* A legal relationship was at
that point formed between the investor and the Spanish Government.**! Spain thus “made
a regulatory compact with investors by offering a vested economic right to earn a FiT or
FiP in exchange for committing investments that materialized in renewable installed

capacity in Spanish territory”.*

Neither Law 54/1997 nor the Feed-in Regulations established that Special Regime
incentives could be modified or eliminated as a result of macro-economic variables,*©
based on any kind of “sustainability principle” or “self-sufficiency principle”. **+ Between
1997 and 2007, Article 15 of the Law 54/1997 simply provided that the Government shall
fix electricity prices against tariffs, transportation and distribution tolls.*° It was only in
2007 — ten years after Law 54/1997 — that a principle of “self-sufficiency” was introduced
in Article 18.1 of Law 54 by Law 17/2007, and it was not the broad “sustainability”
principle described by the Respondent; it only concerned the very specific situation of
tariffs of last resort in order to avoid distorting competition.* If there was ever a more
encompassing principle of self-sufficiency of the Spanish electricity system, that was only

introduced as a binding parameter in December 2012, through Law 15/2012, one of the

Disputed Measures.**’ Before then, the Respondent had funded part of the electricity
system’s costs through general State revenues, which disproves the existence of any such

principle.

Renewable Energy Plans were not adopted to estimate the costs of increasing renewable
energies nor did they set up any discernible limits to an investor’s returns. Rather, they
estimated the amount of money required to fund the desired increase in installed capacity
and decide on effective regulatory stimuli to attract that capital in the form of
investments.** As noted above, RD 661/2007 guaranteed the right to sell all electricity
produced (priority of dispatch), the purpose of which was that investors would not bear
the electricity demand risk.** The Renewable Energy Plans’ estimation of future demand
cannot be used to defeat that purpose. Nor can the underlying assumptions concerning

returns and operational life prevail over the terms of the applicable royal decrees.

Contrary to Respondent’s assertions, Articles 40.3 of RD 436/2004 and Art. 44.3 of RD
661/2007 are not confined to scheduled revisions of the “regulated tariff and the upper
and lower limits” of RD 661/2007, or the “tariff, premiums, incentives and supplements”
of RD 436/2004. Their scope is much broader. They protect existing installations from
any “detrimental adjustment” or “downward revision” (other than those envisioned in the
applicable updating and revision provisions) or, at the very least, they created justifiable
expectations to that effect.*” This interpretation flows from the context in which these

provisions were issued and the conduct of Spanish authorities in reliance of them.*”!

361 See the Preamble of Law 24/2013, as amended (“Act 54/1997, of November 27, has proven insufficient to ensure
the financial equilibrium of the system”), C-0212.

311 Otherwise, the Claimants asked: “Why did CNE urge the Spanish Government to respect the grandfathering
provision of RD 436/2004 during the elaboration of RD 661/2007? Why was the State Attorney required to issue a

report on the potential retroactivity of RD 661/2007 in light of Article 40(3) of RD 436/2004? Why did the Spanish

 

Government reach an Agreement with AEE and Protermosolar before introducing retroactive amendments in RD
661/2007 through RD 1614/2010? And further... how could thousands of sophisticated and experienced investors

123

325.

326.

Until 2012 the Respondent had “constantly sought to improve the regulatory stability of

renewable energy projects”>””,

, Negotiating any proposed amendment with the renewable
energy sector before putting it in place. RD 661/2007 was not introduced following the
adoption of RDL 7/2006 to remedy the “perverse effects” of RD 436/2004 and protect the
sustainability of the electricity system as the Respondent contends. As a matter of fact,
the changes made by RD 661/2007 enabled the Government to “establish even higher FiTs
and FiPs”,?”? which were increased for those technologies having the lower levels of
growth such as biomass and thermosolar. Regulated tariffs were also raised for wind
installations*”* and the cap & floor mechanism introduced with respect to premiums for
all technologies did not benefit the Spanish Government only (i.e. no FiP if market price
above the cap) but also investors (i.e. minimum FiP if market price below the floor),
strengthening price stability under the FiP option.*” These changes were all coherent with
the Feed-in model. Moreover, a transitional period was established to protect existing

installations.*”°

Nor was RDL 6/2009 adopted to rebalance the sustainability of the electricity system. It
was just another “[failed] attempt to deal with the Tariff Deficit in a manner compatible
with [Spain’s] renewable energy policies, without using renewable investors as
scapegoats.”°”” It only affected prospective investors. Even so, investors who managed
to get pre-registration and to build on time would benefit from the remuneration’s regime
under RDL 6/2009. Therefore, “through RD-L 6/2009, the Respondent incentivized

prospective investors to make stronger investment commitments in exchange for specific

and banking institutions be so naive so as to commit multimillion euro investments in risky renewable ventures on

the basis of meaning less provisions’

guarantees of stability and legal certainty”.*”* Moreover, Spain eventually accepted
additional installed capacity above the initial objectives on the basis of studies that
concluded that this was economically feasible,?”” which disproves that RDL 6/2009 had

been necessary to ensure the sustainability of the electricity system.

Properly understood, FiTs and FiPs were not subsidies but costs to correct market failures
and ensure the correct functioning of the electricity market, diversifying and strengthening

energy supplies.*®° They are therefore not covered by the EU state aid legislation.

(b) The 2010 Agreement

If there was ever some degree of regulatory risk, Respondent made it disappear in 2010
when it entered into an agreement with the Wind sector to guarantee the stability of the
feed-in regulations. After lengthy negotiations, both parties agreed to reciprocal
concessions “leading to a compromise solution recorded in writing and described by the
Ministry itself as an Agreement without inverted commas”.**! So did multiple Spanish
authorities and the AEE.**? The Respondent subsequently included the provisions of this
agreement into the first draft RD 1614/2010 released on 30 July 2010, the relevant date

for purposes of Article 24.1.c. of Law 50/1997 on the Spanish Government.

Contrary to Respondent’s contentions, these negotiations were not part of any ordinary

consultative process under Article 24 of Law 50/1997; they preceded the draft royal decree

and cannot be subsumed under that provision. The result of this agreement was Article

5.3, pursuant to which Respondent committed “not to approve regulatory changes that
>> 383

affected the remuneration to be received by La Muela”,”*” as reported in contemporaneous

documents. This was “an additional guarantee of legal stability to the one existing in

Article 44.3 RD 661/2007, which did not include a specific guarantee on the

384 its purpose being to serve as a “cldusula de intangibilidad”>*> In

Premiums,
addition, the Government included Article 2.4 in fine, under which the number of
equivalent hours of operation would not be revised for wind farms already registered on

RAIPRE, like the Wind Farms.

The access toll introduced by RDL 14/2010 does not in any way disprove the existence of
this agreement nor its binding force. Article 17 of Law 54/1997 empowered Respondent
to establish access tolls, a factor which was not new for the Claimants when they decided
to invest in the Wind Farms. For the Wind subsector this toll, whose economic impact was

minimal, was not considered a breach of the Agreement.

Claimants asked, and the Tribunal ordered, the Respondent to produce several documents
relative to the 2010 Agreement. The Respondent did not comply with these requests and
orders. The Tribunal should, therefore, draw negative inferences against the Respondent

when assessing the evidence adduced by the Parties on this point. 3°

(c) The approval of the Disputed Measures

The changes to the regulatory framework started in 2012, after a new Government took
office. The purpose of these changes was to reduce the tariff deficit, a problem of Spain’s
own creation. Its essential cause lies in “the Government’s repeated failure to set regulated
retail consumer tariffs that would recover the full costs of the electricity services that Spain

29387

regulates”°*’ as well as its decision to include in the system costs that do not belong to it,

such as support schemes for Spanish insular territories. Financial incentives to the wind

sector played only a limited role in the accumulation of the tariff deficit. Even though the
Respondent had multiple alternatives available to address this problem, it decided to adopt

the Disputed Measures which were neither necessary nor proportionate.

First, Law 15/2012 introduced a 7% cut on the remuneration of energy producers under
the guise of an environmental tax, the TVPEE.*** This measure had a disproportionate
effect on wind installations which have generally higher costs. It is also discriminatory
because renewable energy producers, unlike conventional (non-renewable) producers,
cannot pass the tax over to consumers and the Claimants’ Wind Farms do not receive
specific remuneration under the new regime; therefore, the fact that the amounts paid for

TVPEE are considered recoverable costs under such regime is of no avail.

RDL 2/2013 then eliminated de facto the FiP option by reducing premium values to zero,
and therewith the “right” to choose annually between FiP or FiT under RD 661/2007.
Contrary to Respondent’s contentions, this measure did not follow a recommendation
made by the CNE to reduce premium by 12% in order to remedy an inconsistency in the
premium’s calculation; it went far beyond. Nor are the effects of this measure comparable
to the termination of the Premium option for PV producers introduced in 2007. RD
661/2007 increased the Regulated Tariff as compensation for such measure, making PV
investments more attractive. Additionally, the substitution of the CPI, another change
brought about by RDL 2/2013, had a negative impact on the Wind Farm’s profitability
from January 2013 to mid-July 2013.

Just a couple of months later, RDL 9/2013 repealed the Special Regime of Law 54/1997
altogether. It then took a year for the Respondent to substitute the specific remuneration
parameters, a period during which producers were left in uncertainty. Such parameters
were only set out in RD 413/2014, later supplemented by MO IET/1045/2014. To make

things worse, they were to apply retroactively from the date of enactment of RDL 9/2013,

in July 2013. Meanwhile, payments were made on account of a final regularization under
the new regime, leading to the “compulsory payment to the Respondent of EUR 460,000
‘unduly’ received [by the Wind Farms] between July 2013 and June 2014”.°*°

This whole process was the product of “grossly arbitrary and non-transparent conduct by
the Respondent”.*”° The draft RD 413/2014 was submitted for fast-track consultation
without the remunerative parameters which came later, when MO IET/1045/2014 was
approved. This prevented renewable agents from assessing the economic implications
arising from the new system. Meanwhile, the Respondent hired two consulting firms,
BCG and RB, in an obscure tender process to calculate the remunerative parameters and
verify IDAE’s estimates and methodology. BCG and RB handed over two reports. The
reports criticized IDAE’s hypotheses and methodology, especially when applicable to
existing installations. Among others, BCG considered that a standard installation type
benchmark should not be applied to existing installations because of their heterogeneity.
It also noted that IDAE failed to gather accurate data to adopt the New Remuneration
Model. They both concluded that the Respondent considered standard investment costs
for each installation type lower than their real costs. BCG also stressed that the
Respondent overlooked extensive construction and financing costs incurred by existing

projects in defining the standard installation type.

Notwithstanding repeated requests by stakeholders and its own transparency regulations,
the Respondent refused to disclose the BCG and RB reports or any other internal studies.
Instead, it requested changes to the BCG and RB reports. Pending implementation of these
changes, the Respondent adopted the New Remuneration Model behind closed doors
disregarding the experts’ technical advice and the renewable sector’s recommendations.

After putting it in place, the Respondent terminated BCG’s contract, threatened to execute

bank guarantees against BCG and refused to disclose any of the BCG-RB material to

investors.

The Claimants asked, and the Tribunal so ordered, that the Respondent produced several
documents relative to these reports. The Respondent did not comply with these requests
and orders. The Tribunal should draw negative inferences against the Respondent when

assessing the evidence adduced by the Parties on this point.*?!

(d) The impact of the Disputed Measures

According to the Claimants, the new regime is an unprecedented system based on
regulatory principles radically different from the previous regime; more akin to natural
monopolies than traditional Feed-in regulations.*” It is a “paradigm change” and a “clear

cut case of opportunistic regulatory behavior.”?>

The old regime was designed to increase energy output by offering investors higher rates
of return on an ex-ante basis if electricity production was maximized efficiently — even if
this came at a higher cost.°* Neither Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 nor the Feed-in

Regulations capped potential returns; they only set a floor.

Under the new regime, renewable energy installations are no longer entitled to incentives
and have very few reasons to maximize electricity output.*”. Specific remuneration is
available only if the cap of 7.398% on pre-tax returns is not surpassed, a cap that does not
reflect the WACC of the industry, as the CNE has pointed out.*” To figure this out, past
earnings are computed from the start of each plant’s regulatory life (hence retroactively),

even though none of the Disputed Measures existed before 2012. If the installation

qualifies, it receives specific remuneration for a maximum period of 20 years, regardless
of the installation’s actual operational life. Plants such as the Wind Farms can operate up
to 41.4 years subject to minimum repair and they would have been entitled to feed-in
incentives for this whole period under RD 661/2007. KPMG estimates that this would
require adding around EUR 67.5 million of CAPEX in 2028°°” (a sum Econ One considers
excessive as the total initial CAPEX of the plants was between EUR 94 and 99 million. It
proposes to use a figure of EUR 17.2 million instead, which corresponds to the costs of

replacing the rotor blades).*?*

The New Remuneration Model applies retroactively to erase the Special Regime de
facto?” The “reasonable rate of return” is calculated taking into account the standard
plant’s earnings under previous regulatory framework. If the remuneration received prior
to July 2013 exceeds the level determined under the new regime, the excess is offset by a
reduction in the remuneration to be received from July 2013 onwards. This aspect of the

new regime was even criticized by Supreme Court judges.*°°

The investment costs attributed to the Wind Farms (IT-00652) are also lower than their
real investment costs. “°! Order IET 1045/2014 sets an initial CAPEX of EUR 94.7
million for an IT-00652 Standard Facility, whereas the Projects’ initial CAPEX was nearly
EUR 5 million higher.4° Moreover, Renerco continued to make investments after 2001,
with a current value of the total fixed assets (total CAPEX) of EUR 108.8 million’
(neither KPMG nor the Claimants explain the precise impact of a higher total -as opposed

to initial- CAPEX on damages).

As for the Projects’ OPEX, KPMG states that they are actually 14% lower than those
defined in MO IET/1045/2014. Claimants, therefore, do not make any claim in relation to

the New Regime’s OPEX estimations.**

In addition, TVPEE and penalties for reactive energy continue to apply although the
supplement has been erased, and the new obligation imposed on renewable producers to
finance situations of tariff imbalance has led to significant delay in payments. For
instance, by 30 June 2015, renewable producers had collected only 82.68% of the
payments they were entitled to under the new regime corresponding to the first half of

2015.4

In the case of the Claimants’ Wind Farms, they have been “stripped of every single
incentive based on the argument that [they] had already achieved the standard 7,398%
pre-tax return, even though this cap did not exist [before]”.4°° Cash flows have come down
by 81.2% resulting in damages to the Claimants of around EUR 70 MM.*” As a result of
this, the New Remuneration Model has substantially reduced La Muela’s IRR from 9.40%
to only 7.08% (after-tax), which means an “impact and an effect on IRR, with a difference
of 2.33% (post tax)”. The New Remuneration Model thus deprives the Claimants of
their legitimate rewards under the former regulatory regime.*”? The Claimants undertook
technological and construction risks because that regime offered the possibility of earning

returns higher than what the Respondent now considers to be reasonable.

Because of the impact of the Disputed Measures, the Claimants had to refinance their
loans in onerous terms (the “2016 Refinancing”). BayWa AG stepped in as guarantor
(which is at odds with the non-recourse nature of the original financing arrangement); the

payment schedule was prolonged from 19 to 23 years; financial ratios are now much

stricter; the ordinary interest rate increased from 0.75% to 1.60%; dividends cannot be
distributed to shareholders until debt is fully repaid and the Project’s credit rating has

dropped significantly.

Lastly, the New Remuneration Model is the antithesis of stability. It contemplates deep
regulatory changes every three and six years: “Today the ‘reasonable rate of return’ is
7.398%. But tomorrow it could be 6% or even 5%. It all depends on the Respondent’s
mood, since the methodology (if any) for updating the ‘reasonable rate of return’ or, more
specifically, the spread that will apply in future regulatory periods has not been

disclosed.”4'°

(e) The Claimants’ expectations

Claimants state that they did not expect that a particular royal decree would remain frozen,
but they did expect, and were entitled to expect, that any change would preserve “the
essential conditions that were guaranteed when they invested (FiT or FiP during the entire

lifetime of La Muela).”4!!

The original investors built up the Wind Farms under this understanding.*!”

incorporation on 7 November 2003, BayWa AH (formerly RENERCO) “inherited the

Upon its

expectations of its founding companies.”*!? These expectations “evolved as Spain
developed the Special Regime in line with its renewable policies”:*"* first, by the
enactment of RD 436/2004 which improved the conditions of RD 2818/1998 and included
aexpress grandfathering commitment (i.e. Article 40.3); and then by RD 661/2007 which
kept the essentials of the previous royal decree and included an additional grandfathering
commitment. Claimants’ expectations were further confirmed after the Spanish

Government and AEE reached the July 2010 Agreement in which further promises of

stabilization were made. Thus, when the opportunity arose on 8 September 2011, to
acquire a controlling stake in La Muela from Shell, the Claimants did not hesitate to
increase their investments in the Spanish renewable sector. This is the relevant date for
legitimate expectation purposes. It was in reliance of the regulatory framework as it stood
at the time, that BayWa AH (through BayWa RE) decided to acquire a controlling stake
in the Wind Farms.*!> For due diligence purposes, however, the relevant date should be
November 2009, when BayWa AH acquired most shares of Renerco (later renamed

BayWa RE).*!6

351. The Supreme Court decisions cited by the Respondent are irrelevant to the assessment of
Claimants’ expectations.*'’ The vast majority of them were issued “after the Claimants
invested in La Muela (i.e. ...from September 2011 onwards)”.*!® Those issued before
cannot simply “override the numerous statements made by the Spanish Government
regarding the meaning of Regulatory Framework No. | and the express assurances made

under the Agreement [...]”.4!

First of all, these decisions concerned appeals under
Spanish law seeking annulment of royal decrees for violation of Spanish law’s hierarchy
of norms. They did “not consider the reasonable expectations of investors and the liability
of the Spanish administration as a result of these expectations being frustrated.”*?? The
subject-matter of these proceedings is therefore very different from this arbitration.
Second, they deal with relatively “minor modifications to specific features of an
installations’ remuneration’?! the extent of which was tempered by grandfather clauses
and transitory provisions. They did not concern a complete change of paradigm
eliminating all incentives, as in this case. Third, investors are not required under the ECT

to carry out exhaustive research into the case law of the host State. Due diligence is all

that is needed. Fourth, following these decisions, AEE and the Spanish Government
reached the July 2010 Agreement. The existence of this agreement and the commitments
adopted thereunder “has a stronger impact on the Claimants’ legitimate expectations than
any of the prior and subsequent judgments adopted by the Supreme Court.”4?? The
Supreme Court cannot contradict the Government’s public declarations. None of the
presentations made by Government officials mentioned the Supreme Court’s case law to
prospective investors, nor that the whole system could be abrogated without compensation

based on macro-economic variables.‘?7

The new regime came unexpectedly for existing installations. It is not true that the new
measures were announced at the end of 2011 and that investors should have seen them
coming. The new regime developed chaotically from 2012 until the end of 2014. Even as
late as in July 2013, no one knew exactly what sort of reform the Respondent would
implement. The only thing that was announced in 2011 was the new Government’s

determination to address the tariff deficit.

Likewise, the existence of the tariff deficit does not undermine Claimants’ expectations.
Spain adopted RDL 6/2009 to remedy the tariff deficit, while it guaranteed that in the
event that pre-registered capacity was higher than the capacity objectives established in
Article 37 of RD 661/2007, the remuneration regime under RD 661/2007 would be limited
exclusively to pre-registered facilities (Fifth Transitional Provision). In these
circumstances, Claimants had even stronger grounds to assume that their investment in
the Wind Farms, which had been registered as far back as 2002, would not be negatively
impacted by the Respondent’s issues with the Tariff Deficit. The same considerations
apply with even stronger force to the Resolution of the Council of Ministers of 13
November 2009. By this resolution, the Government decided to accept capacity in excess

of the initial targets on the basis of reports that concluded that the system could stand

+22 Ibid, para. 295.
23 Ibid, para. 314.

134

354.

355.

356.

357.

3,100 MW per year until 2014.74 Another reason for the Claimants to believe that pre-
existence of the Tariff Deficit would not jeopardize the stability of the Feed-in Model
applicable to the Wind Farms is the fact that the financial support to the wind sector, and
to renewable energies in general, was not the main reason for the accumulated Tariff

Deficit.

Finally, the Respondent’s insinuations on state aid have no bearing on this case. It was
perfectly reasonable for the Claimants to believe that the regulatory framework as it stood
was compatible with EU law. Spanish authorities never notified their feed-in legislation
to the EC. Raising this issue at this point is just an attempt by the Respondent to abuse

this proceeding.

(2) The Respondent’s position
(a) The evolution of the regulatory framework

Law 54/1997 guaranteed a reasonable return to investments of Special Regime producers
calculated by reference to the cost of money in the capital market (Article 30.4). Nothing

else was promised or guaranteed.*?>

To ensure this level of remuneration, subsidies were offered to producers “where
applicable” to cover their costs and ensure a profit (Article 16.7).*?° Although subsidies
took the form of “feed-in” incentives through various royal decrees (e.g. RD 2818/1998;
RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007), Law 54/1997 did not impose this form of remuneration nor

did it require the Government to maintain it.4””

Law 54/1997 guaranteed a reasonable return and not a more precise remuneration rate

because that would have undermined the capacity of the Government to adjust

359.

remunerations if the application of any given formula resulted in returns higher than
reasonable and thus in contravention of Law 54/1997 and EU state aid regulations, or
where the system’s sustainability so required.*”* The framework was meant to be flexible
to cope with changing economic, social and technical conditions in a highly regulated and
economically sensitive area. Furthermore, the fundamental criterion used by Law 54/1997
to judge the reasonableness of the rate of return is the cost of money in the capital market

(ie. interest rates), which is in itself a dynamic benchmark.*”?

Precise remuneration values were thus left to lower-rank, ease-to-amend, regulations such
as royal decrees, which can be superseded by subsequent regulations of the same rank
under the Spanish law principle of hierarchy of norms.**° As confirmed by Spanish courts
every time an amendment was challenged by producers since as early as 2005, this left
the Government with ample discretion to substitute existing regulations and modify
remuneration formulas in respect of both existing and prospective installations provided

that a reasonable return was preserved.**!

Registration in the RAIPRE did not confer an acquired or vested right to a specific
remuneration rate or regime.**? It was just an administrative requirement applicable to all
special (i.e. renewable energy) and ordinary (i.e. conventional) regime facilities feeding
electricity into the grid. None of these facilities was granted a license, contract or
concession under Spanish law as a result of registration. The CNE made this clear as early
as in 2004, in a report on a preliminary draft of Royal Decree 436/2004.** So did Spanish

courts around the same time.**4

Articles 40.3 of RD 436/2004 or 44.3 of RD 661/2007 did not preclude all sorts of
detrimental changes or downward revisions as the Claimants contend.**> Only mandatory
quadrennial revisions of the “regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits” of RD
661/2007, or the “tariff, premiums, incentives and supplements” of RD 436/2004, were
excluded in respect of registered installations. Those are the scheduled “reviews [or
revisions] referred to [and provided for]” in the corresponding sections of Articles 40.3

and 44.3 as it follows from their own terms.**°

Extraordinary revisions were still possible and permissible including “(i) those resulting
from adopting macroeconomic control measures or (ii) to avoid situations of excess
remuneration or unreasonable return or (iii) to guarantee the economic sustainability of
the SES.”477 So were changes in other variables having an impact upon remunerations
such as the number of hours amenable to tariffs and premiums; the index used for
adjusting tariffs and premiums to inflation; the supplement (or penalty) for reactive power
and taxes or other fiscal measures. Moreover, neither Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004 nor
Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 provided anything concerning the right to choose between

tariff or premium subsidies.

That is why RD 436/2004 Article 40.3, whose wording is very similar to RD 661/2007
Article 44.3, did not entail that RDL 7/2006 froze remunerations for all registered
plants.7® Nor did it prevent RD 661/2007 from reducing remunerations under
RD 436/2004, including for existing plants with no exception as of 31 December 2012.4”
All these changes were upheld by Spanish courts.*#° The Charanne and Isolux tribunals

According to the principle of economic sustainability, regulated revenues (i.e. tariffs paid
by the consumers) ought to be sufficient to cover regulated costs (i.e. incentives,

premiums, etc.).44!

As Claimants’ own experts concede, this principle follows from the
architecture of the legal framework; it was not introduced for the first time in 2007 or
2012.44? Since its enactment in 1997, Article 15.1 of Law 54/1997 provided that
“{a]ctivities involved in the supply of electric power shall be remunerated economically
in the manner provided by this Act, based on the tariffs, tolls and prices paid”.“? Contrary
to Claimants’ contentions, what Law 15/2012 did was to establish an exception to this
principle by authorizing electricity system’s costs to be funded through general State

revenues. This confirms rather than disproves the general rule of self-sufficiency.

Just as royal decrees cannot be interpreted in isolation of higher norms to which they are
subordinate, they cannot be dissociated from the renewable energy plans upon which they
are based.4 These plans did not only estimate costs as Claimants contend. They also
assessed whether these costs were sustainable for the electricity system as a whole based
on technical and economic assumptions, including projections of electricity demand,
standard lifetime of plants, operating hours, average costs, among other things.“ The fact
that regulations were predicated upon these plans, including their underlying assumptions,
was no mystery. The preambles of both RD 436/2004 and RD 661/2007 refer explicitly

to the 2000 and 2005 Renewable Energy Plans, respectively.“°

As these plans show, remunerations for wind farms such as the Claimants’ installations

were intended to be at around 7% after taxes (with own resources) based on an estimation

of around 2,350 to 2,400 operating hours/year and a lifespan of 20 years.“47 Standard
installations were used as a reference for setting all these values.*“* Contrary to Claimants’
allegations, financial costs were never considered to be a recoverable investment for
purposes of calculating returns. This is the same methodology used by the CNE in its
reports on draft decrees 436/2004 and 661/2007.*? All these values were commented on

in various studies made by renewable energy associations since as early as 2005.4"

It is not true that RD 661/2007 intended to offer higher returns**! or that it was designed
to attract foreign investment: “no precept specifically designed for this purpose can be
found in any of the articles of RD 661/2007. Neither RD 661/2007 nor any of the
legislation regulating the SES is a Foreign Investment Act. Neither does it provide for
tariffs and premiums to be fixed in foreign currency, nor for them to be updated based on
non-domestic indices. Far less do they provide that their modification would require the
consent of the foreign investor.” *? Rather, RD 661/2007 was introduced to substitute
RD 436/2004 and fix the “perverse effects” of the TMR on remunerations.**? This index,
which remunerations under RD 436/2004 were tied to, was calculated based on the costs
of the electricity system. Subsidies to renewable energies (in the form of premiums and/or
regulated tariffs) are one of these costs. Thus, while the TMR was in place a constant
feedback (or loop effect) in remunerations occurred. This led to a disproportionate
increase in the costs of the electricity system and “windfall profits” for renewable energy

installations including wind farms.*** That is why RDL 7/2006 was adopted in the form

of an urgent measure (i.e. a RDL) followed by RD 661/2007. This is clearly reflected in
RDL 7/2006’s preamble.**>

The 2005 Renewable Energy Plan, upon which RD 661/2007 was based, did not call for
a remuneration increase to all renewable energy installations.4° The Claimants
misrepresent the preparatory works leading to the enactment of RD 661/2007. The 2005-
2010 Renewable Promotion Plan expressly stated that the initial objectives set out for
most technologies including wind power could be achieved by maintaining the current

remuneration levels.‘°”

In fact, RD 661/2007 went as far as to reduce remuneration
conditions for PV technology by eliminating with immediate effect the possibility to
choose between regulated tariff and pool price plus premium. It did this notwithstanding

Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004, one of Claimants’ purported stabilization commitments.

As it is well known, the 2009 financial crisis had an extraordinary impact on the Spanish
economy. This led to a sharp fall in the electricity demand which, in turn, caused tariffs
to rise much more than the average European level. Many of the most critical assumptions
upon which RD 661/2007 was premised were disproved, including electricity demand

forecasts, which bear deeply in the overall balance of the system.

Prompted by the crisis, the Government adopted a series of measures starting in 2009 to

ensure the economic sustainability of the system and address the growing tariff deficit.4*

The first measure was RDL 6/2009, whose title and preamble speak for themselves.**°
This Decree set up a pre-assignment register and gave the Government the power to scale
up entry into operation of preregistered installations. Although new capacity above the

diligent investor who had, at least, read the Preamble to the 13 November 2009
Agreement, would have known that, if any of the risks noted should arise, the Kingdom
of Spain would have to continue implementing measures to ensure the economic and
technical sustainability of the SES.4° RD 1578/2008 had already introduced

preregistration for PV plants and yet the Government made changes in 2010.*°!

Similarly, the 2010 Renewable Energy Plan was more explicit than its predecessors in
stressing the importance of sustainability and the need for “*...minimising the speculative
risks posed in the past by excessive rates of return, which not only hurts consumers but is

also damaging to the industry in general...”4°

RD 1565/2010 then eliminated regulated tariffs for PV installations from their 25"" year
of operation and introduced additional requirements concerning wind farms on wind

facilities.*

(b) The 2010 Agreement

RD 1614/2010 was enacted shortly thereafter. Like previous measures, its essential
purpose was to guarantee the long-term sustainability of the electricity system. Its

Regulatory Impact Report makes this clear.***

Consistent with this purpose, RD 1614/2010 reduced remunerations to both existing and
prospective wind facilities (although in different degrees), and limited the number of hours

amenable to premiums above certain thresholds.**

Article 5.3 was not a compromise nor was it intended to preclude the Government from

making further changes going forward.*© This provision just made Article 44.3 paragraph
2 of RD 661/2007 (concerning the inapplicability of ordinary remuneration revisions in
respect of registered plants) valid with regard to not only tariffs, caps and floors (which
were already covered by Article 44.3) but also premiums (like former Article 40.3 of RD
436/2004) in relation to both registered and pre-registered installations (i.e., installations
that had been commissioned under RDL 6/2009). In doing so, the Government sought to
avoid an unintended consequence of RDL 6/2009 — namely, that ordinary revisions
contemplated in Article 44.3 paragraph 1 applied to pre-registered installations, which
was not judged convenient at the time. This is expressly noted in the preamble of RD
1614/2010.*” Just like Article 44.3 (to which Article 5.3 is tied), Article 5.3 did not rule

out other revisions or adjustments.**

The fact that RD 1614/2010 was discussed with and eventually supported by renewable
energy associations such as AEE does not change its nature nor does it turn it into a
preclusive agreement of any kind. Consultations with stakeholders are mandated by the
law of administrative procedure for the approval of royal decrees (Article 24.1.c and d of
Law 50/1997). Multiple examples of like negotiations exist. Contrary to Claimants’
contentions, they can take place either before or after the hearings contemplated in the
administrative procedure law. Here they took place before. There is nothing exceptional

about it.

Whether an agreement is reached or not, the Government retains the power to enact
proposed regulations. RD 1565/2010 was passed, for instance, even though PV producers

strongly opposed it and no agreement was reached. Moreover, under Spanish law even if

an agreement is reached and the proposed regulation is enacted, the Government may still
repeal or amend it if considered appropriate. Law 54/1997 was agreed upon and yet it was
revised several times and eventually derogated from. Tellingly, not even AEE asserted

any such argument when it challenged the Disputed Measures in the Spanish courts.

Similarly, RD 1614/2010 did not prevent the Government from issuing RDL 14/2010 just
weeks after concluding the alleged agreement.*”” This measure introduced access tolls in
respect of all producers including wind installations, thereby in effect cutting down
remunerations. This shows that neither RD 1614/2010 nor the agreement upon which is
said to be based was intended to curtail the Government’s ability to introduce further
adjustments to remunerations if the sustainability of the system so required. The preamble

of RDL 14/2010 is clear about this.‘7!

(c) The approval of the new regulatory regime

As with the 2009-2011 measures, the Disputed Measures sought to ensure the economic
sustainability of the electricity system and correct situations of overcompensation in the

context of a severe economic crisis.

As a result of the global financial crisis, Spanish GDP shrunk, the rate of unemployment
grew from 8% in 2007 to 25% in 2012; the fiscal position of the Government deteriorated;
the accumulation of budget deficits between 2008 and 2012 resulted in an increase in
Spain’s Government debt from 39% of GDP in 2008 to 85% of GDP in 2012; revenues in
the electricity system were negatively impacted by lower demand for electricity and the

tariff deficit went from EUR 2 billion in 2005 to EUR 26 billion in 2012.

It was in this context that the Disputed Measures were adopted. But these were not the
only measures taken by the Government. Electricity prices paid by consumers were raised

becoming one of the highest in Europe; the Government committed funds from the State

383.

budget to fund the deficit as an exception to the self-sufficiency principle; entry into
operation of pre-registered plants was deferred; remunerations for transmission and
distribution activities were reduced, and so was the remuneration for electricity production
in insular territories; payments for capacity were also reduced, among many other steps.
Even though subsidies to renewable energies are a main cost of the electricity system, the

Government sought to balance out the measures.

The first of these measures was Law 15/2012, which introduced a 7% tax on electricity
producers (i.e. the TVPEE).*” This tax did not have a disproportionate impact or
discriminatory effect on renewable energy producers; it applied to both conventional and
renewable energy producers alike. Moreover, Law 15/2012 not only introduced the
TVPEE; it also created three additional taxes unrelated to renewable energy. Finally, if
conventional producers could pass on the tax to consumers, renewable energy producers,
whose remuneration is calculated by reference to market prices, would benefit from the
resulting market price increase. This disproves the idea that renewable energy producers

were disproportionally affected by this measure.

RDL 2/2013 then fixed premiums at 0 EUR/kWh under the Price plus Premium and
Incentive option for certain technologies including wind energy and substituted a new
index, the CPI, for updating remunerations.‘”> The former measure was in line with
RD 661/2007, which had years before eliminated the Price plus Premium and Incentive
option for PV technology, leaving PV producers with regulated tariffs only.*” It is not
true that RD 661/2007 increased the Regulated Tariff in compensation for this measure.
As for the CPI, this measure was adopted to bring the remuneration’s updating mechanism
into conformity with generally accepted economic practices in other States, excluding

some of the most variable inputs from the calculation’s formula. During its brief tenure (it

was superseded by subsequent regulations), it did not cause any prejudice to the

Claimants’ Wind Farms.

The process that led to Spain’s adoption of the Disputed Measures was also transparent.*”>

Spain announced in 2011, this is, more than 2 years before the first measure was taken,
that it was considering a structural reform to the system. All main measures were put out
for public consultations with stakeholders. The largest renewable energy associations such
as APPA and AEE actively participated in this process. The comments received were
carefully considered by the Spanish authorities: many of these were accepted, resulting in

changes to the initial drafts.*”®

For instance, the first draft of RD 413/2014 was made public only 4 months after RDL
9/2013 came into effect. Claimants base their critiques against this measure on a CNE
report of the time. However, they omit to say that, precisely as a result of the CNE’s
observations, the Government restarted the process to have this decree approved including
all the requisite legislative steps. Later, the CNE issued a new report in which it praised
the Government for having taken care of its observations. In other words, the Claimants’
critiques were fixed during the legislative process. Similarly, the first draft of MO
TET/1045/2014 was circulated only 3 months after the draft RD 413/2014 and received

observations from all over the industry including AEE.*””

The Claimants misrepresents the real purpose and scope of the BCG and RB’s reports.*”8

BCG and RB were not engaged to calculate the basic parameters of MO IET/1045/2014;
their role was to provide support and technical assistance. IDAE was the real technical
expert. As neither BCG nor RB finalized their reports in time, they could not be added to
the administrative file that led to the approval of RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014 or

be made available to the public. The working documents that the Claimants complain

about not having been disclosed were just preliminary drafts, not yet final, and were

subject to confidentiality obligations.

387. Be that as it may, the investment costs (CAPEX) considered by MO IET/1045/2014 fall
within the ranges proposed by BCG and RB in their working documents and are fully in
line with the market averages at the time the Claimants’ facilities were built. The operating
costs (OPEX) included in the MO IET/1045/2014 are also in line with those observed by
both consulting firms. The methodology employed in MO IET/1045/2014 was endorsed
by BCG as the only one possible. Finally, both BCG and RB consider that it is “necessary
to take account of the past remuneration of the Plants in order to be able to set the future

remuneration, without this involving retroactivity.”4”?

(d) The impact of the Disputed Measures

388. According to Spain, the new remuneration’s regime is neither “opportunistic” nor does it
amount to a “paradigm change” as the Claimants contend.** The essential aspects of the

former regulation, as properly understood, are preserved.

389. Both the former and the new remuneration’s regime seek to provide a “reasonable return”

on the investment and operating costs of a “standard” renewable energy facility by

reference to the cost of money in the capital market (i.e. a dynamic benchmark).**!
Although the new regime specifies that the rate to be used for this purpose is that of the
average yield of ten-year Spanish Government bonds plus 300 basis points, the result is
essentially the same: a rate of return of 7.398% (pre-tax) which is consistent with the 7%
return that the old regime sought to provide. In this respect, “the new System not only
continues with the previous System, but it gives investors greater security because (1) it

enshrines in law the return that should be granted to investors, (2) it identifies the specific

capital market that should be used for setting the return and (3) it sets the specific return

that investors can aspire to.”4

It also sets out clear timeframes for purpose of reviewing
the operation of the various remuneration criteria, something that the Government did in

practice under the previous regime by enacting successive royal decrees.**?

Contrary to Claimants’ representations, the old regime did not offer subsidies
indiscriminately. They were subordinated to the goal of providing a reasonable return to
investors as a complement to market prices. They were due therefore only “where
applicable” to accomplish this goal. This is very clear from the terms of Article 30.4 and
Article 16 of Law 54/1997.484 As noted above, although from 1998 to 2012 subsidies
were given in the form of “feed-in” incentives through various royal decrees (e.g. RD
2818/1998; RD 436/2004, RD 661/2007), Law 54/1997 did not impose this form of
remuneration nor did it require the Government to maintain it. In any event, both the
former and the new remuneration regimes provide generous subsidies to renewable energy

producers. *85

The New Regime is not “retroactive”; it only applies prospectively.**° It considers existing
situations such as the income received by the installations under the previous regime for
the sole purpose of setting remunerations for the future. This is needed to comply with EU
state aid regulations. It would be “retroactive” if producers were compelled to return the
income received above the target rate of return, but that is not the case. This is expressly
forbidden by Law 24/2013 (Third Final Provision). Thus, even if a facility has received
payments above the target level of return, the State is not authorized to claim back or

collect the excessive remuneration.

394.

The difference between the two systems lies in the manner in which subsidies are set
forth.**” Under the old regime (as supplemented by RD 661/2007), subsidies were given
in the form of feed-in incentives and were thus tied to production; under the new regime,
subsidies are based on cost estimations. Although these two methodologies differ in that
respect, both seek to cover the estimated investment and operating costs of a standard
facility and leave the owner with a profit of around 7%. Importantly, not even under the
old regime were subsidies provided for the full production of the plants, but they were
capped to a maximum number of operating hours. This limitation was introduced by
RD 1614/2010 in respect of wind facilities, a measure that the Claimants have not
challenged in this case. Before then, operating hours were factored in by renewable
energy plans along with other variables to calculate the incentives needed to allow for a

reasonable return.

Just like under the old regime, producers still have an incentive to be efficient in terms of
costs and to produce more than the estimated operating hours.*** Although no subsidies
are granted above that level, the electricity delivered can be sold at pool prices and is
afforded priority of access to the grid. If, in addition, producers manage to have lower
costs than those estimated, their net profit will be higher than 7.398% (pre-tax). The only
difference in this respect is that now the framework contemplates more types of standard

facilities.

The costs estimations that the new regime seeks to cover adequately and to reflect CAPEX
and OPEX of actual plants.**? They were made carefully based on information collected
by IDAE for years about the operation of real plants in Spain. But generalities aside, the
Claimants have not even compared the estimated costs in the MO IET/1045/2014 with the

actual costs of their Wind Farms. Instead, they claim damages for the whole difference in

396.

cash flows that they say results from the application of the new regime as if they were

entitled to these revenue streams under the legal regime frozen as of 2011.

According to Econ One, the CAPEX and OPEX of the Projects have been unreasonably
high, something that the Claimants have failed to explain.*”° For instance, the Projects’
initial CAPEX was higher than the Projects’ own estimates in 2001 and also higher than
the estimated costs for a Standard Facility IT-00652. Econ One believes that the
explanation may be that CAPEX reported in the audited financial statements included
capitalized financing expenses but those do not represent real investments and should be
excluded. If this is corrected, the Projects’ initial CAPEX goes down to “€ 95.1 million, a
figure that is closer to the CAPEX shown in the Investors Base Case (€ 93.8 million) and
the Standard Facility IT-00652 (€ 94.7 million).’”*! Similarly, although all the Projects’
operating cost projections in the record (e.g. the 2001 projection, 2006 refinancing, 2016
refinancing, and KPMG projection) are lower than the operating costs for a Standard
Facility IT-00652 (i.e., all the available operating cost projections specific to the Projects
indicate that the Projects should obtain higher returns than the Standard Facility), the
Projects’ historical operating costs, as reported in their financial statements, have been
substantially higher than any projection in the record in all but a few years.*?? At the
same time, KPMG claims that the operating costs of the Projects are lower than those

defined in MO IET/1045/2014.4

In any event, if the Claimants’ Wind Farms are no longer entitled to subsidies, that is
because they have received already a reasonable rate of return on their investments. From
2002 to 2012, the average internal rate of return of standard facilities IT-00652 such as

the Claimants’ farms has exceeded 8% net of taxes; this is higher than the target rate of

398.

return under the new regime.*** Nearly half of these facilities’ revenues reflected public
subsidies (46.85%). Furthermore, it is estimated that by the end of their regulatory life in
2022, IT-00652 facilities — even operating only on market revenues — will achieve a 9.6%
IRR (post-tax) and public subsidies would represent nearly a third of their total

revenues.*>

In the case of Claimants’ Wind Farms, Econ One has calculated that that they have a post-
tax internal rate of return of 8.88% in the actual scenario (with the Disputed Measures in
place).*”° This is the IRR that results after some adjustments to KPMG’s calculations such
as excluding capitalized financing expenses from the initial CAPEX; computing historical
and future taxes in cash flows; estimating operating and maintenance costs according to
the OMS Contract Amendment; anticipating further capital expenses in 2028 for EUR
17.2 million (i.e., 20% of the original EPC contract) and using a 7.25% discount rate to
calculate the Enterprise Value in the Actual Scenario. But even adopting all the
assumptions embedded in KPMG’s model, the IRR would still be above 7% (after-tax),
specifically 7.08%. This number matches KPMG’s IRR calculation in the Actual
Scenario. The difference is that Econ One does not calculate a case-specific But-for IRR
with which to compare this figure. Instead, Econ One takes the position that under the
former regime, Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable rate of return of around 7%
irrespective of the actual rate of return that resulted from the application of RD 661 (as

amended). Therefore, they see no adverse impact as a result of the Disputed Measures.

Nor have the Projects been rendered worthless by the Disputed Measures. The enterprise
value of the projects as of 31 December 2015, in the Actual Scenario is about EUR 53
million, using all of KPMG’s assumptions except its unreasonably high future CAPEX

estimate. The debt of the Projects on the same date was about EUR 29 million, resulting

in an equity value of the Projects of about EUR 24 million, 74% of which belongs to
Claimants.**’ Moreover, according to KPMG’s own projections, the Projects are projected

to generate substantial cash flows from their operations in KPMG’s Actual Scenario.***

Finally, if Claimants are having difficulties in servicing the Projects’ debt, that is because
of the decisions made in 2006.*”° That year, the Projects’ owners decided to refinance the
Projects’ debt and used the inflow of funds to distribute EUR 17.3 million to shareholders.
This was a major turning point in the financial health of the Projects. As a result, in 2012
the Projects were more leveraged than at the outset (i.e. at the end of 2006 debt represented
91% of the total capital, as opposed to 74% initially) and were thus ill-prepared to cope
with unexpected business downturns. This and not the Disputed Measures is the reason

behind the Projects’ financial difficulties.

(e) The Claimants’ expectations

The Respondent asserts that 2003 and 2009 are the relevant investment dates for assessing
Claimants’ expectations.* Renerco (today BayWa RE) was formed in 2003 with a
portfolio that included a 32.6% interest in the Wind Farms. That is, therefore, the date of
BayWa RE’s investment. BayWa AH, on the other hand, invested in 2009 for the first

time when it acquired most of the shares of Renerco.

In 2003, RD 2818/1998 was in force. This statute does not provide for any of the alleged
stabilization promises relied upon by the Claimants in this case. Furthermore, the 2001
and 2006 financing agreements contemplated the possibility of changes and/or cuts in the
remuneration regime.>”! In 2009, on the other hand, only RD 661/2007 was in force. This
means that RD 1614/2010, RDL 14/2010 and RDL 1/2012, all of which are invoked by

the Claimants at some point or another to support their legitimate expectations case, could

not have had anything to do with Claimants’ initial decision to invest in Spain.

By 2009 all investors knew or should have known of the Spanish jurisprudence on
regulatory changes, which supplements the legal framework for renewable energies and
contributes to define investor’s rights thereunder.» Since 2005, the Supreme Court made
it clear that renewable energy producers did not have a right to a specific royal decree’s
remuneration formula remaining unchanged, and that the Government was authorized
under the principle of hierarchy of norms to adjust remunerations downward in respect to
both existing and prospective plants provided that Law 54/1997’s reasonable return was
preserved.*” Investors knew that royal decrees could be superseded and that is why they
lobbied the Government (although unsuccessfully) to have the specific remuneration

values set out in the text of the law.

Article 40.3 of RD 436/2004 was not found to be an impediment to the regulatory
adjustments introduced by RDL 7/2006 and RD 661/2007. Nor did article 44.3 of RD
661/2007 prevent subsequent adjustments brought about by RD 1578/2008, RDL 6/2009
and RD 1614/2010. All these changes share the same Jeitmotiv: the need to ensure the
electricity system’s economic sustainability and to avoid situations of excessive
remuneration to some technologies including wind power.* They were all upheld by
Spanish courts even though they led to reduced remunerations. It is not true that they

improved remunerations for wind energy producers as the Claimants contend. Proof of it

 

 

is the opposition and strong criticism by renewable energy associations every time one of

these measures was adopted.>°”

This jurisprudence was known and referred to in reports made by the CNE in 2007 and
2008,>° and even criticized by renewable energy associations in several publications of
2010.° Before then, these associations had also complained about prior amendments
being “retroactive” insofar as they affected RAIPRE-registered plants.>!° Quite
eloquently, after the draft RD 661/2007 was disclosed for comments in early 2007, APPA
went as far as to state that from that point on any investor “must consider the risk that such
remuneration could be lowered” outside the terms of Article 40.3.5!! This shows that,
contrary to the Claimants’ assertions, renewable energy producers knew that these
provisions did not preclude the Government from adjusting remunerations downwards.
Any investor diligent enough to do basic research when BayWa AH invested for the first
time in Spain would have learned about this. In addition, the CNE made it clear as early
as in 2004 that registration in the RAIPRE did not confer an acquired or vested right to a

particular remuneration regime.>!

Claimants cannot seriously fall back on a few press releases by the Council of Ministers
and power point presentations by Invest in Spain or CNE’s employees, which they have
not demonstrated that they knew about at the time, to rebut this consistent and widely
disseminated jurisprudence.*'? Nor would it be reasonable for them to believe (if they
ever did) that Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 or Article 5.3 of RD 1614/2010 would rule out
subsequent changes. Press releases have no legal value under Spanish law, something

that any reasonably informed investor knows or should know. Nor do these press releases

or the presentations relied upon by the Claimants support the positions the Claimants look
to derive therefrom. The former merely summarize in colloquial terms the content of the
various measures adopted by the Council of Ministers; the latter simply point to certain
aspects of the regulatory regime as existing at the time. No promises of stabilization are

made.

406. The Claimants’ contractual and financing documents show that they envisaged the risk of
regulatory changes.*!* Clause 27 of the 2001 financing agreements expressly provides for
a scenario in which remunerations vary.°!> This clause remained unaltered after the 2006
refinancing.*'© So too did clause 13.4 of the agreement signed between La Carracha and
Plana de Jarreta with EGL Spain for the sale of energy, which expressly considers the risk
of a modification in the remuneration’s regime (i.e. then RD 436/2004).°!” Furthermore,
the Claimants’ own evidence in this case shows that the industry had already experienced
adverse changes in the remunerations of some plants, such as when RD 436/2004 was

replaced by RD 661/2007.7!8

renewable energy plans, both of which are relied upon by the Claimants in this case, made
this clear.**° Even the informative brochure (“Project Information Prospectus”) prepared
by the initial developers of the Wind Farms to attract investments estimated an internal
return of around 6.98% (as results from projecting the cash flows referred to in that
brochure).*?! So too did the parent company of the Claimants, BayWa AG, when BayWa
AH (then Renerco) acquired an additional interest in the Projects in 2011. BayWa AG
applied a 6.8% discount rate to the cash flows expected to be generated by the Projects.”

recoverable investment for purposes of calculating returns.°?? This is the same
methodology used by the CNE in its reports on draft decrees 436/2004 and 661/2007.>**
Furthermore, all these figures, assumptions and estimations were commented on in
various studies made by renewable energy associations since as early as 2005, which

shows that investors were perfectly aware of them.>”>

issues arise.

(dd) The Expropriation Claim (Article 13 of the ECT)
(a) The Claimants’ position

The Claimants maintain that the ECT protects investors from direct and indirect
expropriation, unless carried out in accordance with the conditions laid down in Article
13.1 of the ECT. In particular, they allege that the rights of property over the investment
has been affected, which consists of the management and economic enjoyment of Parque

E6lico La Carracha, S.L. and Parque Eolico Plana de Jarreta, S.L56

Contrary to what the Respondent alleges, the Claimants do hold an investment that is
capable of being expropriated.*”’ This consists of shared capital and debt in the two SPVs
owning the Wind Farms.*?* To demonstrate the expropriation of their assets, the Claimants
argue that the three requirements of the test proposed by the Respondent are fulfilled.
First, the Claimants hold an asset. Second, it has a property right consisting of an indirect
shareholding interest in the SPVs. Third, a causal link exists between the “abrogation of
Regulatory Framework No. | and the impossibility for the Claimant[] to legitimately

benefit from their investments in the SPVs [...]”.°7?

The Claimants maintain that the Disputed Measures qualify as an indirect expropriation
as opposed to a non-compensable regulatory Governmental measure.>*? This is because
the Disputed Measures are contrary to the public interest, are discriminatory against the
Wind subsector and La Muela, have caused a disproportionate damage to La Muela and

did not comply with due process of law.>?!

532 the Claimants maintain that case law has

Finally, referring to Charanne v. Spain,
established that the “effect of such indirect expropriation may be seen in the substantial
deprivation of the investment”.*** The deprivation can be seen in the effect of the measures
on the management and enjoyment. First, due to the Disputed Measures, the Claimants
had to focus on the survival of the SPVs to avoid their bankruptcy, which had a negative
effect on the management.>** Second, the Claimants were no longer able to enjoy the
investment, as, since, 2011, the SPVs no longer pay dividends which “is in itself an

expropriation”.>>

(b) The Respondent’s position

The Respondent denies that it has expropriated the Claimants’ investments. This is for
three reasons. First, there was no indirect expropriation since no investment susceptible
of being expropriated exists.**° Second, the Disputed Measures did not expropriate the
Claimants.°*’ Third, the Disputed Measures do not meet the criteria for an indirect

expropriation.**

Spain maintains that the Claimants’ investments cannot be subject to an expropriation.>?
Since the Claimants’ investments are comprised of the ownership of 74% of the
shareholdings of the SPVs, their shares and debts can be expropriated.*4° However, what
cannot be expropriated under Spanish law is the “right to receive specific dividends and

to the management and administration of rights”.*4!

Moreover, the Respondent refers to various other awards to argue that for a measure to

constitute a “compensatable expropriation”, five requirements must be met: “(i) if the

measure is recognised as one of the regulatory powers of the State; (ii) the purpose (public)

and the effect of the measure; (iii) if the measure is discriminatory; (iv) the proportionality

between the measures used and the objective sought; and (v) the bona fide nature of the
99542

measure. It goes on to analyze all five requirements to prove that the Disputes

Measures do not amount to an expropriation.***

In addition, the Respondent explains, that the Disputed Measures do not constitute a
substantial deprivation of the Claimants’ investment.>“4 This is first, because the
Claimants have not lost their ownership of the shares.*#> Second, the Disputed Measures
did not restrict the Claimants in exercising their alleged rights of management and
enjoyment of the shares.*“° Third, there is no causal link between the Disputed Measures
and the financial difficulties of the Wind Farms.**” Said financial difficulties arise out of
the “free business decision” taken by the Claimants.*“* Fourth, the Spanish tax authorities

have already confirmed the non-expropriatory character of the TVPEE .*4°

Finally, Spain rejects the claim that the Claimants have suffered any reduction in the value

of their shares. Therefore, the Respondent has not breached Article 13 of the EcT.5°

(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of
any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated
or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to
nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as
“Expropriation”) except where such Expropriation

 

(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;
(b) not discriminatory;
(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation.*>!

During oral argument the Claimants said nothing about the Article 13 claim, simply
referring the Tribunal to the written pleadings.*°* Although that claim was not formally

abandoned, in the circumstances it can be dealt with rather summarily.

First, it is necessary to distinguish between the claim for expropriation under Article 13
and claims made under Article 10, 1st-3rd sentences, based on alleged frustration of
reasonable or legitimate expectations or due protection. Article 13 of the ECT, like other
expropriation guarantees, is concerned with the protection of property interests, including
certain legal rights to money or benefits, from seizure or taking, or with conduct equivalent

thereto.

Secondly, when it comes to conduct tantamount to expropriation (or as formulated in
Article 13 of the ECT, conduct having an “effect equivalent”) it is necessary to bear in
mind the principle that expropriation, direct or indirect, requires substantial deprivation

of the asset in question. For example, the tribunal in Electrabel observed:

51 ECT, Art. 13.1, RL-0006.
582 Ty-E, November 2017 Hearing, Dayl, p. 19:19-25 (Rodriguez).

159

As regards indirect expropriation, the Tribunal considers that the
wording of Article 13(1) ECT requires Electrabel to establish that
the effect of the PPA’s termination by Hungary was materially the
same as if its investment in Dunamenti had been nationalised or
directly expropriated by Hungary. In other words, Electrabel must
prove, on the facts of this case, that its investment lost all significant
economic value with the PPA’s early termination.*?

423. There are many decisions to similar effect.°*

424. In the present case, the Claimants’ investments in the Wind Farms have taken the form of
shares in the project companies, and the control associated with them. Nor did the

Claimants assert a legal right to subsidies of which either of them has been deprived.

425. The Spanish courts have consistently denied there was any such right to subsidies. For
example, in its Judgment of 20 March 2007, the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court

stated:

[Article 30 of the 1997 Act] allows companies to aspire that the
premiums would include [...] to the effect of obtaining ‘reasonable

554 See, e.g., Charanne v. Spain (Final Award), para. 464 (“for a loss of value to be equivalent to an expropriation, it
has to be so large that it equals a deprivation of property”), RL-0049; Novenergia II v. Spain, (Final Award), para.
727 (“It is uncontroversial in international arbitration that a State measure resulting in a ‘substantial deprivation’ of
an investment — that is, when the measure substantially interferes with the control or the economic value of the
investment — constitutes an expropriation.”), CL-0227; Electrabel v. Hungary (Decision on Jurisdiction), para. 6.62
(“In short, the Tribunal considers that the accumulated mass of international legal materials, comprising both arbitral
decisions and doctrinal writings, describe for both direct and indirect expropriation, consistently albeit in different
terms, the requirement under international law for the investor to establish the substantial, radical, severe, devastating
or fundamental deprivation of its rights or the virtual annihilation, effective neutralisation or factual destruction of
its investment, its value or enjoyment. ”), CL-0037; AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Erémii Kft

general interests involved in the proper functioning of the electricity

It added that “the principle of legal certainty [...] does not include any right whatsoever to
freeze the existing law”.°°* Expropriation of intangible rights requires, inter alia, that the

rights in question exist under the relevant legal system, which is not the case here.

It may be recalled that no ECT tribunal has yet upheld an Article 13 claim in relation to
the Disputed Measures. Such claims have either been avoided on the ground that the

dispute was covered by Article 10, or rejected outright.>°

Insofar as the expropriation claim concerns Claimants’ indirect interest in the project
companies, these are still intact and operating under the Claimants’ ultimate control and

continued oversight, although their value is impaired.

In its Reply, Claimants argued, in the alternative, that the overall effect of the Disputed
Measures was a de facto expropriation of the shares, since no shareholder would receive
a dividend from the project companies until at least 2024.°° But this is to confuse the
financial impact of change in the subsidy regime with the taking of property. On that
view, any significant cost or burden on an investor could be equated to expropriation, pro
tanto, by the entity responsible for the cost or burden, and the general distinction between
expropriation and breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard would tend to
disappear. Within broad limits, the loss of advantages is not to be equated to the taking

of rights.

The Tribunal concludes that here was no conduct tantamount to expropriation, and the

Article 13 claim fails.

(2) The Umbrella Clause Claim (Article 10 of the ECT, last sentence)

[...] Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has
entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any
other Contracting Party.

Two aspects of this stipulation are immediately apparent. It applies to obligations
generally, but only those which the Contracting Party ‘has entered into with’ an investor

or investment of another Contracting Party.

(a) The Claimants’ position

In its Request for Arbitration, the Claimants state that in the 1990s the Respondent put in
place a specific legal and economic regulatory framework to promote power generation
from wind energy, which by the end of the 1990s and during the 2000s “provided for
specific incentives aimed at inducing investors to engage in renewable generation projects
in Spain.”°°! Those incentives had been articulated though a Special Regime the
Respondent committed to comply with.*°* However, between 2012 and 2014 the
Respondent ‘made continuous drastic changes to the regulatory framework’*® which

breached Article 10.1 of the ECT.5™

This is particularized to some degree in the Claimants’ Memorial, which identifies
“statutory provisions and official statements by state officials” as the basis for the
umbrella clause claim.>® Specifically, the Claimants argue that the Respondent “set forth
a favorable regulatory framework for the Wind subsector” through the central pieces of
Regulatory Framework No. 1 (i.e. Law 54/1997, RD 2818/1998, RD 436/2004, RD
661/2007 and RD 1614/2010), which provide for rights and guarantees for investors in

6

the wind subsector, and which “contained unilateral commitments addressed to a

437.

particular business sector (renewable energy) and a specific subsector (Wind) for the
purposes of attracting investors therein.”°°’ As regards the Respondent’s official
statements, Claimants’ highlight a number of press releases issued by the Respondent
stating that “Regulatory Framework No. 1 was not going to be changed for those
renewable energy facilities that would meet certain requirements... particularly being
already registered in the RAIPRE.”>® The Claimants list a series of unilateral acts of the
Respondent which, in their view, gave rise to obligations towards them, including: official
press releases dated 25 May 2007; 2 July 2010; 3 December 2010; 23 December 2010;
and 27 January 2012;> statements by two Ministries of Energy;>’° as well as other
documents (Brochures by Spain’s IDAE, presentations by Invest in Spain in foreign
countries, international roadshows, and ribbon-cutting ceremonies for the inauguration of

renewable energy facilities).>”!

The Claimants’ Reply explains this argument in more detail. The Claimants argue that
Article 10.1 of the ECT, final paragraph is one of the most extensive umbrella clauses,>””
whereby a State can oblige itself by either a bilateral relationship (in investment law, a
contract) or a unilateral relationship (i.e. a unilateral act of the State such as a statutory
provision or an official statement by state officials).°”? The Claimants argue that, through
the unilateral acts described above, Respondent specifically committed itself not to change

the regulatory framework applicable to the energy sector for La Muela,>”* and that the

umbrella clause protects such a commitment.>’”> The Claimants suggest that the mere

abrogation of RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 was a violation of the umbrella clause.>’°

In their closing argument, the Claimants, without formally abandoning the umbrella clause

claim, placed little or no reliance on it>77

(b) The Respondent’s position

In its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Respondent
denies having breached the umbrella clause for six reasons. First, the Respondent argues
that the Claimants’ interpretation of the umbrella clause is contrary to the literal wording
of Article 10.1 of the ECT and the dominant concept in international jurisprudence and

doctrine, which would require a bilateral commitment (i.e., an agreement or contract).>78
Second, the Respondent denies having assumed specific obligations with any investor or
investment, whether by the regulatory framework, the press releases, or other unilateral
acts.°”? Third, the Respondent says that the Claimants did not allege or confirm that the
unilateral acts played a decisive part in their investment, and the Claimants accepted the
risk that the remuneration regime that existed at the time of investment could change.>*°
Fourth, in the hypothetical case that the Respondent had assumed specific obligations by
the unilateral acts, these obligations would never have been assumed with the Claimants
or their Investment. This is because, according to the Respondent, those obligations could
only be recognised for renewable energy facilities, and not to third parties who hold a
stake or debt in the companies that own those facilities.**! Fifth, the Respondent denies

having made any commitment to the Claimants or their Investment freezing the

remunerative regime that was in force when the investment was made.>*? Sixth, the
Respondent affirms that the Disputed Measures comply with the Spanish system of
remuneration to plants that generate energy from renewable sources and that in particular

the guarantees of priority access and dispatch were maintained.***

In its Rejoinder, without abandoning its previous arguments, the Respondent focused on
three points.** First, it insisted that the Claimants’ interpretation of the umbrella clause is
contrary to: the literal meaning of Article 10.1 of the ECT; the concept as applied in the
arbitration decisions interpreting the ECT; and the concept that predominates in
international law.°*° Second, the Respondent denies having made any unilateral
commitment to the Claimants or to their investment pursuant to the regulatory framework
or otherwise. The Respondent argues that the regulations were applicable to all producers
of electrical energy covered by them and did not contain specific commitments; that
registration in RAIPRE did not create obligations towards the Claimants; and that the
press releases and road shows were generic and were not directed at attracting foreign
investments.>*° Third, the Respondent reiterates that the Claimants did not demonstrate
that they made the investment relying on those alleged commitments. The Respondent
adds that the Claimants have not proved that it saw the presentations of InvestSpain, of
the IDAE or of the CNE, or that it attended the inauguration of the Gemasolar thermal
solar power plant or that they knew about the press releases. Moreover several of these
unilateral acts occurred after 2003 and 2009, two essential moments for the Claimants’

investments.°*”

In its closing argument, the Respondent relied on the /solux tribunal’s analysis of the

umbrella clause argument. There the tribunal found the Respondent had not entered into

agreements establishing specific obligations with the claimants or their investment in
Spain, and hence the tribunal declined to examine whether there had been noncompliance

with those hypothetical obligations.>*

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis

(i) The generic claim

In the Tribunal’s view, the umbrella clause in the last sentence of Article 10.1 of the ECT
only applies to obligations specifically entered into by the host State with the investor or
the investment. The paradigm case is an obligation under an investment contract duly
entered into. By contrast the Tribunal does not accept that obligations arising under the
general law, including legislation, of the host State, fall within the scope of the clause.
When enacting legislation, the State establishes binding rules of conduct, but it does not
make specific promises to each person entitled to claim under the law, nor does it enter
into obligations to specific investors or their investments even when these entities are

numbered among the beneficiaries of the law. A general law is not a promise.

But even if it were a promise, it would be a promise under Spanish law, an obligation
governed by that law. The obligations to which the umbrella clause refers are
paradigmatically obligations governed by the law of the host State (in the case of
contractual obligations, the proper law of the contract). But unless a national law creates
vested rights, obligations under such a law cease when the law is relevantly and validly
amended or repealed. In the case of the Disputed Measures, their validity was upheld in
numerous decisions of the Spanish Supreme Court.**? Following the supersession of the
earlier laws and decrees, there was no relevant obligation of Spain, nothing for the

umbrella clause to operate upon.

444. This understanding of the operation of umbrella clauses worded as that in Article 10.1 of

the ECT has been upheld by numerous investment tribunals.>”

445. The Claimants rely for the contrary view on dicta in several cases:

(a) In Plama v. Bulgaria, the tribunal said that “the wording of this clause in Article
10.1 of the ECT is wide in scope since it refers to ‘any obligation.’ An analysis of
the ordinary meaning of the term suggests that it refers to any obligation regardless
of its nature, i.e., whether it be contractual or statutory.”°?! However, the tribunal
understood that it did not need to extend its analysis because in that case the parties
were exclusively concerned with the application of the umbrella clause to
consensual obligations.*” Moreover, the tribunal said that it “believes that the ECT

does not protect investors against any and all changes in the host country’s laws.”°*?

(b) In Amto v. Ukraine, the tribunal expressed the view that “[t]he so-called ‘umbrella
clause’ of the ECT is of a wide character in that it imposes a duty on the Contracting
Parties to ‘observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an
Investment of an Investor of the other Contracting Party.””°°* Once again, this

passage is obiter dictum. In Amto the dispute was related to contracts entered into

between an investor’s subsidiary and a legal entity independent from the Ukrainian

State.>*> It did not concern obligations under general legislation.

In Mohammad Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan, the tribunal said that Article 10.1 in fine of
the ECT’s “protection is broadly stated, referring as it does to ‘any obligation’ and,
as such, by the ordinary meaning of the words, includes both statutory and
contractual obligations.”°*° However, in that case the claimant had argued that the
respondent had breached contractual obligations and that its issuance of licenses did
not comply with those contracts.” Moreover, the tribunal went on to add that “this
provision does not refer to general obligations of the State arising as a matter of

law.758

In Liman Caspian Oil v. Kazakhstan, the tribunal drew an analogy between host
State’s offer to submit disputes to arbitration and unilateral promises under the
umbrella clause.*°? However, in that case the tribunal expressly said it did not have

to deal with the umbrella clause claim.°°° Moreover, the tribunal added that:

it is not clear from the wording of ECT Article 10(1), last
sentence, whether the ‘umbrella clause’ also encompasses state
legislation concerning the protection of foreign investment... the
words ‘obligation the Respondent has entered into with an
investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting
Party’ in ECT Article 10(1), last sentence, rather seem to suggest
that a contractual or similar bilateral relationship must exist
between the host state and the investor.

In any event, the Claimants had not demonstrated any breach of local law, and thus

602

no breach of the umbrella clause could be established on any view.°”” Once again,

this decision does not support the Claimants’ argument.

(e) In Khan Resources v. Mongolia, the tribunal accepted the claimants’ interpretation
of Article 10.1 of the ECT and found that “a breach by Mongolia of any obligations
it may have under the Foreign Investment Law would constitute a breach of the
provisions of Part III of the Treaty.” This case dealt with obligations arising from
the host State’s foreign investment law,™ a specific law designed to attract foreign
investment. The instant case is different. Spain’s regulatory framework was general
legislation that did not provide for distinctions or preferences between domestic and

foreign investors.

(f) Claimants also refer to three Argentina-US arbitrations: Enron, Continental

Casualty, and LG&E. None of these awards made reference to the ECT. (i) In Enron

Corporation v. Argentina, the tribunal said that “‘any obligation’ refers to

obligations regardless of their nature.”©°> The Enron award was annulled, including
the finding on the umbrella clause.°° While the annulment committee said the
reasoning was clear,’ the committee also declined to determine whether the
tribunal’s construction was correct or convincing.®°* Hence, Enron cannot be cited
to support the Claimants’ argument. (ii) In Continental Casualty v. Argentina, the

tribunal held that the obligations a host State must observe under the umbrella clause

“can include the unilateral commitments arising from provisions of the law of the
host State regulating a particular business sector and addressed specifically to the
foreign investors in relation to their investments.” In that case the tribunal also
said that the “umbrella clause does not come into play when the breach complained
of concerns general obligations arising from the law of the host State.”°'° It went on
to find that the provisions of the respondent’s Convertibility and Intangibility Laws
could not be a source of obligations that the respondent had assumed specifically
with regard to the Claimants’ investment company because those laws affected the
generality of the respondent’s public as well as depositors and subscribers to
financial instruments.®'! Hence, the tribunal dismissed the umbrella clause claim
regarding non-contractual instruments. °!? (iii) In LG&E v. Argentina, the tribunal
said that the respondent’s “laws and regulations became obligations within the
meaning of Article II(2)(c) [the umbrella clause], by virtue of targeting foreign
investors and applying specifically to their investments, that gave rise to liability
under the umbrella clause.”°'? The LG&E tribunal considered that the gas law
provisions were specific in relation to the claimants’ investment.°'+ The present
Tribunal finds it hard to analyse that conclusion, given the lack of precision of the
LG&E award on this point. Additionally, in the instant case Spain’s regulatory

regime was not targeted at foreign investors.

In Noble Energy v. Ecuador, an Ecuador-US BIT arbitration, the tribunal observed

that “Ecuador’s obligations vis-a-vis the Claimants stem not only from the

Agreements but also from laws and regulations. It also notes that the Investment
Agreement appears to contain a stabilization clause which may constitute an
obligation of a State capable of falling within the scope of an umbrella clause.”°!>
This passage belongs to a decision on jurisdiction, not an award on the merits. In
that context, what the tribunal said was that the claimants had argued that the
respondent had breached the umbrella clause both by not complying with an
investment agreement, a concession contract, and the electricity regulation.°!° But

the tribunal neither analysed whether the regulation was a specific commitment

towards the investor nor did it adjudicate on the merits.

In Eureko vy. Poland, a Netherlands-Poland BIT arbitration, the tribunal said that
“Tt]he plain meaning —the ‘ordinary meaning’ — of a provision prescribing that a
State ‘shall observe any obligations it may have entered into’ with regard to certain
foreign investments is not obscure... ‘Any’ obligations is capacious; it means not
only obligations of a certain type, but ‘any’ — that is to say, all — obligations entered
into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.”°!” In
that case the obligations protected by the umbrella clause were an SPA and its first
addendum;*'* that is to say, they were contractual obligations. No question arose as

to whether the umbrella clause extended to obligations under general Polish laws.

In EDF v. Argentina, an Argentina-Luxemburg BIT and Argentina-Germany BIT
arbitration, the tribunal said that “[t]he ‘umbrella clauses’ in question are broadly
worded. A clear and ordinary reading of these dispositions covers commitments

undertaken with respect to investors, or undertaken in connection with

investments...”°!? That case dealt with the breach of a concession agreement” and
not with general legislation. Moreover, the tribunal went on to state that that not all

contractual breaches necessarily raise to the level of a treaty violation.°?!

(Gj) In SGS v. Paraguay, an arbitration under the Switzerland-Paraguay BIT, the tribunal

affirmed that:

[...] Article 11[...] creates an obligation for the State to
constantly guarantee observance of its commitments entered into
with respect to investments of investors of the other Party. The
obligation has no limitations on its face —it apparently applies to
all such commitments, whether established by contract or by law,
unilaterally or bilaterally, etc [...] But even as to the Article 11
claims that are predicated directly on Paraguay’s alleged breach
of the Contract, we have no hesitation in treating the Contract’s
obligations as ‘commitments’ within the meaning of Article
11.82

This was an award on jurisdiction. More importantly, in that case the claimants
contended that the respondent had failed to honour commitments undertaken under

a contract, as well as subsequent alleged promises to honour the contract and to pay

debts,°*? and that was the argument the tribunal actually analysed.°™*

(k) In SGS v. Philippines, an arbitration under the Switzerland-Philippines BIT, the
tribunal said that “[t]he term ‘any obligation’ is capable of applying to obligations
arising under national law, e.g. those arising from a contract... Interpreting the

actual text of Article X.2, it would appear to say, and to say clearly, that each

Contracting Party shall observe any legal obligation it has assumed, or will in the
future assume, with regard to specific investments covered by the BIT.”°*> But in
this decision on jurisdiction, the tribunal stressed that the obligation protected by the
umbrella clause must have been assumed in relation to the investment. Specifically,
the tribunal understood that “the host State must have assumed a legal obligation,
and it must have been assumed vis-a-vis the specific investment—not as a matter of

the application of some legal obligation of a general character.”°?°

To summarise, the Claimants’ contention that general laws such as the Disputed Measures
can be considered a commitment protected under Article 10.1 of the ECT finds no support
in the case law of international investment tribunals. To the contrary, tribunals have
consistently resolved (occasional dicta to the contrary notwithstanding) that the ECT
umbrella clause only protects obligations specifically entered into by the host State with
the investor or the investment. These have almost always been contractual obligations. In
no case of which the Tribunal is aware has a provision of the general law of a host State
been enforced under the umbrella clause in Article 10.1 of the ECT or an equivalent

provision.
(ii) Unilateral commitments of Spain

Alternatively, the Claimants argue that unilateral statements made by Spanish officials are
binding as such under international law, under the doctrine of binding unilateral
statements endorsed by the International Court in the Nuclear Tests cases,’ and
articulated by the ILC in its Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral declarations of
States capable of creating legal obligations adopted in 2006.°7* But that doctrine has no

application to statements made vis-a-vis private parties in a domestic context. The French

President’s commitments in relation to atmospheric testing were made against the
background of an interstate dispute which had given rise to interstate litigation; the Court

held that they were intended to be relied on erga omnes at the international level. It said:

The unilateral statements of the French authorities were made
outside the Court, publicly and erga omnes, even if some of them
were communicated to the Government of New Zealand. As was
observed above, to have legal effect, there was no need for these
statements to be addressed to a particular State, nor was acceptance
by any other State required... The Court is entitled to presume...
that these statements were not made in vacuo, but in relation to the
tests which constitute the very object of the present proceedings,
although France has not appeared in the case.°”?

Nor do the ILC Guiding Principles applicable to unilateral declarations of States capable
of creating legal obligations®”° assist the Claimants. As explained in the first preambular
paragraph, the Guiding Principles only apply to the “unilateral behaviour [of States] on

the international plane”. These are defined as follows:

unilateral acts stricto sensu, i.e. those taking the form of formal
declarations formulated by a State with the intent to produce
obligations under international laws.**!

Neither the Guiding Principles nor the commentaries allude to the possibility of
characterizing domestic laws as binding unilateral acts. In the ordinary course of events,
a domestic law providing for subsidies for renewable energy generation is no more made
‘on the international plane’ or ‘with the intent to produce obligations under international
laws’ than a law on any other subject. Nor have the Claimants adduced any evidence of

such an intent in the present case. In this context it may be recalled that the Spanish

measures did not specifically address foreign investors or their investments; they are

generally applicable.

What has been said is sufficient to justify dismissal of the umbrella clause claim based on
Spanish legislation, in particular RD 661/2007. But for the sake of completeness
something should be said briefly about the other alleged sources of obligation on which

Claimants rely.
(iti) |The 2010 Agreement

In 2010, the Respondent concluded an Agreement with the wind subsector group of AEE

on the design of the regulatory framework that applied to renewable energy producers.°**

This agreement was an outcome of an industry-wide consultation, pre-legislative and non-
contractual in character. Moreover, it was carried out with a trade association with no
authority to bind its members. It did not bind the Respondent and did not create any

obligations towards the Claimants as such.
(iv) Press releases and official statements

The Claimants list a series of unilateral acts of the Respondent which, in their view, gave
rise to obligations towards the Claimants, including: official press releases dated 25 May
2007; 2 July 2010; 3 December 2010; 23 December 2010, and 27 January 2012,°°3 and
two statements by the Ministry of Energy. In the view of the Tribunal, these documents
and statements were clearly non-contractual in character and did not create obligations

specifically entered into by the host State with the investor or the investment.

(v) Other documents

The Claimants base their claim on other documents (brochures by IDAE, presentations by
Invest in Spain in foreign countries, international roadshows, and ribbon-cutting

ceremonies for the inauguration of renewable energy facilities).°*°

Again, none of these
documents was contractual in character, nor did they bind the Respondent specifically
with regard to the Claimants or their particular investments. Like other documents
considered in the foregoing paragraphs, they may be relevant in connection with the
Article 10.1 claim and the doctrine of legitimate expectations, but as such they do not

trigger the umbrella clause.

(d) Conclusion on the Umbrella Clause

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ claim under the umbrella clause in

Article 10.1 of the ECT, final sentence.

(3) The Fair and Equitable Treatment Claim: Article 10.1, first and second
sentence

(a) The Tribunal’s Analysis

(i) The applicable FET standard
Article 10.1 of the ECT provides in relevant part as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of
other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.

457.

458.

459.

Article 10.1 has been extensively discussed in successive arbitral decisions,°*° and there
is little point in the Tribunal going over the same ground. But some general points can be

made.

The Claimants laid emphasis on the phrase ‘stable, equitable, favourable and transparent’
(Art 10.1 of the ECT, first sentence). But, as several tribunals have noted, the first
sentence of Article 10.1 cannot be interpreted in isolation from the second sentence.®*” It
does not give a general mandate to ECT tribunals to decide whether Government decisions
affecting investments are ‘equitable’ or ‘favourable’, any more than the FET standard
gives a general discretion to BIT tribunals to impose their own views as to ‘fairness’ and
‘equity’. There is a legal standard embodied in the second sentence of Article 10.1 of the

ECT, which takes into account the prerogatives and responsibilities of governments as

well as the rights and interests of investors.

A useful summary of the state of play was given by the tribunal in Antaris, referring to

the earlier case-law. In particular:

(1) There will be a breach of the FET standard where legal and
business stability or the legal framework has been altered in such a
way as to frustrate legitimate and reasonable expectations or
guarantees of stability.

(2) A claim based on legitimate expectation must proceed from an
identification of the origin of the expectation alleged, so that its
scope can be formulated with precision.

(3) A claimant must establish that (a) clear and explicit (or implicit)
representations were made by or attributable to the state in order to
induce the investment, (b) such representations were reasonably
relied upon by the Claimants, and (c) these representations were
subsequently repudiated by the state.

(4) An expectation may arise from what are construed as specific
guarantees in legislation.

(5) A specific representation may make a difference to the
assessment of the investor’s knowledge and of the reasonableness
and legitimacy of its expectation, but is not indispensable to
establish a claim based on legitimate expectation which is advanced
under the FET standard.

(6) Provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of
persons or a category of persons, do not create legitimate
expectations that there will be no change in the law; and given the
State’s regulatory powers, in order to rely on legitimate expectations
the investor should inquire in advance regarding the prospects of a
change in the regulatory framework in light of the then prevailing or
reasonably to be expected changes in the economic and social
conditions of the host State.

(7) An expectation may be engendered by changes to general
legislation, but, at least in the absence of a stabilization clause, they
are not prevented by the fair and equitable treatment standard if they
do not exceed the exercise of the host State’s normal regulatory
power in the pursuance of a public interest and do not modify the
regulatory framework relied upon by the investor at the time of its
investment outside the acceptable margin of change.

(8) The requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability
as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State’s rights
to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal
system to changing circumstances.

(9) The host State is not required to elevate the interests of the
investor above all other considerations, and the application of the
FET standard allows for a balancing or weighing exercise by the
State and the determination of a breach of the FET standard must be

179

made in the light of the high measure of deference which
international law generally extends to the right of national
authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.

(10) Except where specific promises or representations are made by
the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on an investment
treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes
in the host State’s legal and economic framework. Such expectation
would be neither legitimate nor reasonable.

(11) Protection from arbitrary or unreasonable behaviour is
subsumed under the FET standard.

(12) It will also fall within the obligation not to impair investments
by ‘unreasonable ... measures’ (Article 10(1), ECT) or ‘arbitrary ...
measures’ (Article 2(2), Czech Republic/Germany BIT).

(13) The investor is entitled to expect that the State will not act in a
way which is manifestly inconsistent or unreasonable (i.e. unrelated
to some rational policy).°*

460. Of particular relevance by reason of its subsidies context (though it concerned solar power,

not wind) is the dictum of the tribunal on Article 10.1 of the ECT in Blusun v. Italy:

In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation
to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them
unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it
becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner
which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative
amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance
interests of recipients who may have committed substantial
resources on the basis of the earlier regime.*?

461. The tribunal went on to add:

©8 Antaris v. Czech Republic (Award), para. 360 (references omitted), CL-0243.
© Blusun v. Italy (Award), para 319(5), RL-0105.

180

462.

463.

These considerations apply even more strongly when the context is
subsidies or the payment of special benefits for particular economic
sectors.”

This test was expressly endorsed by both Parties in their pleadings.™!

(ii) Spain's alleged breach of Article 10.1 of the ECT, first & second
sentences

Applying the Blusun dictum, it is necessary to ask the following questions: (1) was there
a specific commitment of intangibility; (2) absent a specific commitment, did the
Claimants entertain a legitimate expectation that subsidies would not be reduced during
the lifetime of the project; (3) were the subsidies lawfully granted; (4) were the changes
of 2013-14 disproportionate to the legitimate aim of the legislative amendments; and (5)
did they have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who had
committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime? By way of summary,
in the following sections, the Tribunal answers these questions as follows: (1) no specific
commitments were made; (2) the Claimants had legitimate expectations of continuation
of subsidies in some substantial form but had no legitimate expectation that the subsidies
regime of RD 661/2007 would be maintained unchanged for the life of the investment; (3)
subject to EU law (considered below) the subsidies were lawfully granted; (4) in all but
one respect (the claw-back of benefits already paid) the Disputed Measures were not
disproportionate, given the circumstances in which they were imposed; (5) to the same
effect, the changes, had they been applied without the claw-back, had due regard to the

ff) (Delgado): “this rule was upheld in Blusun... Our position is that in this case they [sc, the Claimants’ reasonable
reliance interests] have not been respected, and that the rules should be applied to find Spain liable.” And for the
Respondent, Tr-E, November 2017 Hearing, Day 1, p. 225:22 — p. 226:9 (Rivas Kortazar): “We consider that the
Blusun v Italy award... is fully applicable to the case.”

464. In the following sub-sections the Tribunal gives its reasons for these conclusions. In
reaching these conclusions, the Tribunal draws support from its subsequent reading of the
Decision on Responsibility and on the Principles of Quantum, dated 30 November 2018,
in RREEF v. Spain, and refers to several other decisions which the Parties have tendered

and commented on.
(iti) | Was there a specific commitment as to the FIT regime?

465. The Claimants accepted that there was no specific commitment made as to the

immutability of the FIT regime under RD 661/2007: “Claimants’ expectations were

directed towards the conduct of Spain not the freezing of a particular royal decree”.

466. In the Tribunal’s view, this is correct. Not only is it consistent with the position taken by
the Spanish courts in relation both to RD 436/2004%4 and RD 661/2007;° it is also
consistent with the conclusions reached by most of the tribunals which have considered
the matter.°!° Nor is there any reliable inference to be drawn from the various failures or

alleged failures of the Respondent to produce certain documents.”

v. Spain (Award), paras. 553, 555, CL-0234; Isolux v. Spain (Award), paras. 774, 787, RL-0088. In Masdar, the
tribunal held there was a “specific commitment ... that each of the Plants qualified under the RD661/2007 economic
regime for their ‘operational lifetime” (Masdar v. Spain (Award), para. 520, CL-0231). In the present case there
was no equivalent letter to the one construed by that tribunal as a guarantee. It also held that “RD 661/2007...
included a stabilisation clause”, which “is sufficient to exclude any modification of the law, so far as investors, which
had made investments in reliance upon its terms, were concerned” (Masdar v. Spain (Award), para. 503, CL-0231
(emphasis added).

7 The Claimant asks the Tribunal to draw an adverse inference from the Respondent’s alleged failure to produce
certain documents: see above, paragraphs 331, 338. The Tribunal does not consider that any failures that may have
occurred have been established, and in any event, having regard to the elaborate documentary evidence produced by
both Parties, it does not believe that any such defects alter its conclusions of law and fact.

(iv) — What legitimate expectations did the Claimants have?

The Claimants did however argue that they had legitimate expectations that the
Respondent would continue to provide subsidies for its total RE production for the
effective life of the plants, in substantially the form in which they were provided in RD

661/2007.

In this respect the Claimants refer to what they submit are successive ‘grandfather

clauses’: RD 436/2004 Article 40.3 and RD 661/2007 Article 44.3. These provided that:

The tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements resulting from
any of the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to
the plants that commence operating subsequent to the date of the
entry into force referred to in the paragraph above and shall not have
a backdated effect on any previous tariffs and premiums. (RD
436/2004 Article 40(3))

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits
indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the
deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January
of the second year following the year in which the revision shall
have been performed. (RD 661/2007 Article 44(3), 3rd sub-
paragraph)

Reference might also be made to RD 1614/2010, Article 5.3, which provided that:

Without prejudice of that set forth in this Royal Decree, for the wind
technology installations within the scope of Royal Decree 661/2007,
of 25 May, the revisions of the tariffs, premiums and upper and
limits, within the scope of article 44.3 of the aforementioned Royal
Decree, do not affect installations enrolled definitively in the
administrative register for production installations in the special
scheme dependent on the Energy and Mines General Policy Board
dated 7 May 2009...

Of particular importance is Law 54/1997, which was in force until its repeal in 2013.

Article 30.4 provided that:

183

471.

472.

473.

The remuneration arrangements for electric power generation
installations operating under the special regime shall be
supplemented by the payment of a premium under statutory terms
set out in regulations and in the following cases:

To work out the premiums, the voltage level on delivery of the
power to the network, the effective contribution to environmental
improvement, to primary energy saving and energy efficiency, the
generation of economically justifiable useful heat and the
investment costs incurred shall all be taken into account so as to
achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to the cost of
money on capital markets. (emphasis added)

In the Tribunal’s view, this stated a coherent general principle, and is inconsistent with
the thesis that particular Royal Decrees, notably RD 661/2007, stabilized the regime. Law
54/1997 was to be implemented by regulations which would naturally change, and did

change, and not in any uniform direction favouring the recipients.*

In particular, there was no legitimate expectation that subsidies would never be reduced
or capped. Some decrees grandfathered existing plants, but others did not, and although
grandfathering may be best practice it is not in the Tribunal’s view required by the ECT.
Nor does the Tribunal accept that the three ‘grandfather clauses’ cited above established
any general principle.“ Moreover, the decisions of the Spanish Supreme Court from

2005 onwards consistently denied that the subsidy regime was intangible.°°

The Parties disagreed sharply on the relationship between the ‘reasonable return’
provision stated in Article 30.4 of Law 54/1997 and the successive subsidy regimes
established by royal decree. In the Tribunal’s view this a false dichotomy. Article 30.4 of

Law 54/1997 stated a general principle and empowered the administration to give effect

321, CL-0239, See also above, paragraphs 98, 128, 172.

to it by regulation. The stream cannot rise higher than its source, or commit the state to
more than the legislative framework allows. A requirement that the remuneration system
be such as to allow recipients ‘to achieve reasonable profitability rates with reference to
the cost of money on capital markets’ is general in its terms, but it is perfectly intelligible

and imposes some limits on what can be done.

In NextEra v. Spain, the tribunal correctly noted that the regulatory framework “was based
on legislation and legislation can be changed.”®*! As a result, “Claimants could not have
had the expectation that the RD 661/2007 regime was frozen and could not be changed.”
Yet, NextEra relied on specific assurances given to the investor, which confirmed that the
Spanish Government had no intention to change the incentives regime as contained in RD

661/2007.°3

A somewhat different view was taken by the tribunals in two more recent cases against
Spain. In 9REN, the tribunal agreed with UNCTAD that “that legitimate expectations
may arise from ‘rules not specifically addressed to a particular investor but which are put
in place with a specific arm to induce foreign investments and on which the foreign
investor relied on making his investment.’ Based on this, the 9REN tribunal decided
that RD 661/2007 constitutes a clear and specific commitment.°*° Referring to Masdar, it
concluded that the specific letters the investor in Masdar had received “simply confirmed”

the content of RD 661/2007.%°

Moreover, the Cube tribunal considered RD 661/2007 to create expectations by deciding

that “Claimants were entitled to rely on the maintenance of the relevant tariffs and

premiums set out in Article 36 RD 661/2007 throughout the reasonable planned operating
life of each power plant.”©’ Whereas it agreed that states have the right to regulate and
change their legislation, it also noted that Spain committed itself to guarantee the stability
of the incentives regime.** Consequently, it decided by majority that the claimants
correctly relied upon the representations made by Spain in RD 661/2007 and the

accompanying press release.

(v) Were those legitimate expectations violated by the Disputed
Measures?

Turning to the question of breach, it follows from the analysis of legitimate expectations
in paragraphs 467-476 above that it is not sufficient for the Claimants to show that certain
expectations were impaired or affected by the measures complained of. To recall the point

made specifically with regard to subsidies in Blusun:

[...] if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in
a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative
amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance
interests of recipients who may have committed substantial
resources on the basis of the earlier regime.°

Thus it is necessary to assess the proportionality of the change in financial arrangements

and whether it had due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients of subsidies.

As to the aim of the Disputed Measures, the primary reason given, then and now, was to
address the deficit on the tariff account of the SES (as to which see Section IV(G) above).

This had already been declared to be ‘unsustainable’ in the preamble to RD 6/2009,°°

passed at around the time the Claimants made a substantial tranche of their investment.

By 2013 the accumulated investment had reached some EUR 29 billion.%! This was not

662

really contested by BayWa,° which instead argued that other measures (notably,

increased customer tariffs) could have been adopted to deal with the problem, and that the

RE producers should not have been required to bear the whole burden of cuts.°

480. In the Tribunal’s view, the growing deficit on the energy account was, and was known to
be, unsustainable. But it is not for the Tribunal to second guess reasonable measures taken
to address the deficit (including measures affecting existing plants), to propose alternative
policies that could have been adopted, or to weigh up for itself the competing demands of
generators and consumers. If the measures were “not disproportionate to the aim of the
legislative amendment, and [had] due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of
recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier

39664

regime they would be consistent with the FET standard in Article 10.1. Applying

that standard, it is necessary to differentiate between different aspects of the Disputed

Measures.
(vi) Regulatory rather than actual plant life

481. In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent objected to Claimants’ expectation that the
Regulated Tariff would apply to the whole operational life of the facilities.°° Spain

explains that the New Regime’s remuneration system is complemented by the regulatory

short-term effectiveness of the Measures from July 2013 onwards as a tool for reducing regulated costs. On the
contrary, our negative assessment of the reasonableness of these measures was focused on their lack of regulatory
orthodoxy”). But lack of regulatory orthodoxy is not equivalent to unfair and inequitable treatment: more is required.

lifetime of a standard facility. The end of the regulatory life sets the time at which a
standard facility has reached the reasonable return set by the Regulator, i.e. when the
standard facility has recovered its investment and operation costs through market revenues

and subsidies received.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimants’ engineering expert, Mr. Holzmiiller, expressed the
view that the plants could last for up to 41 years, but he accepted that substantial capital
expenditures would be incurred at 25 years.® This estimate was not contested by Econ
One, or for that matter by the Respondent, which sought to justify the 20-year limit on

economic grounds.

Cube involved PV and hydro plants, a series of investments made in the period 2008-
2011, and not wind power. The Tribunal understands that the life expectancy of wind
power plants is shorter than hydro plants. Earlier regulations had been clear that the
incentives regime would last for longer than 20 years, though possibly at a reduced
level.’ There is a case for 25 years as a reasonable target.** Although none of the
following cases involved wind turbines, nearly all the tribunals which dealt with the issue
considered the useful life of renewable energy plants under the Spanish regulatory regime

to be 25 years:

° In Antin, the tribunal noted that the evidence submitted was inconsistent and the
assumed lifetime spanned from 20 to up to 40 years. In particular, the tribunal
noted that substantial repairs to the plants had to be made after 25 years, which

would affect the subsidy according to Article 4.3 RD 661/2007. Based on the

evidence submitted the tribunal decided that the useful life of the plants is 25

years.

In Eiser, the tribunal was not convinced by the documentary record submitted to
it, which was limited and inconsistent. However, the primary document used, an
expert due diligence report, was supportive of a 25-year life. Therefore, the

tribunal rejected the claim that the plants were designed for a 40-year life.°”°

In the same vein, the Masdar tribunal assumed a life of 25 years, rejecting the
claimants’ claim as to a 40-year operational life, based on the weight of the

evidence, which contradicted the claimants’ assertion.*”!

The RREFF tribunal agreed and decided that the useful life of CSP plants should
be considered to be 25 years, which corresponded to the claimants’ initial

assessments before the dispute arose.°””

Based on the above, the Tribunal considers a 25-year life to be an appropriate regulatory

life for wind plants.

(vii) The ‘standard facility’ as a basis for calculation?

It was argued that the Claimants’ legitimate expectation related to its own plants: to adopt
some other standard of calculation deprived them of the benefit of their prudent
investment and management of the plants.*”* On the other hand, Spain had to deal with
some 6,000 wind plants, not to mention other RE facilities; there were elements in earlier
legislation of calculations based on standard facilities, and it was not unreasonable, at least

for the future, to calculate subsidies on the basis of standard facilities, adapted to the

method of power generation. In the end, in the Tribunal’s view, this aspect of the

Disputed Measures did not breach Article 10.1 of the ECT.
(viii) | Estimated costs under the Disputed Measures

486. The Parties disagreed as to the sufficiency of the estimated costs under the new regime:
their respective positions have already been described.°” The Tribunal has found that
there was no binding commitment on the part of Spain to the level of subsidies under RD
661/2007, and thus no claim under the ECT’s umbrella clause.*” As to the estimated
costs constituting or at least contributing to a breach of Article 10.1, first and second
sentence, it is necessary to consider separately operating from capital expenditures. As to
OPEX, there is no claim that these were excessive.° As to CAPEX, the Respondent
sought to explain the apparent under-estimate of the Claimants’ CAPEX by reference to
such features as the inclusion of financing costs which were inadmissible for financial
support. On that basis the difference between Claimants’ adjusted CAPEX and the

attributed CAPEX under the Disputed Measures is relatively slight, and does not evidence

a breach of fair and equitable treatment.°””

(ix) ‘Retrospectivity’ and the Claw-back

487. The Spanish courts held that the Disputed Measures were not retrospective, and that

finding is entitled to some deference.*’® Moreover, Spain did not claw back money

actually paid above the total allowable amount of subsidies: the claw-back was in the
nature of a set-off rather than a counterclaim. Except for a short advertised period in 2013-
2014, before the level of payments under the Disputed Measures was fixed and came into

force, ‘overpayments’ of subsidies were not recovered back.

But the Disputed Measures took into account earlier subsidies for the purpose of assessing
future payments, resulting in no entitlements for the Claimants’ facilities. This is a weaker
form of retrospectivity, but the label ‘retrospective’ is not crucial: what matters is the

substance.

The Respondent argues that the Disputed Measures were not retroactive because they did

not affect acquired rights.

The Tribunal agrees, for reasons already given, that there was no acquired right to
remuneration in future, still less to ‘a fixed and unchanging FIT’. But that is not the point.
It is one thing to amend payments for future production with immediate effect, and another
to reduce payments that would have otherwise been made by reference to payments

lawfully made in the past in respect of past production.

The Respondent also relies on the decision of the tribunal in Nations Energy Inc v.
Panama.§” That was an expropriation claim concerning substantial restrictions on the
right to rely on investment tax credits under a new law, which the claimants alleged had
retrospective effect, contrary to the Panamanian Constitution. The tribunal held that the

claimants did not have the right that they claimed to transfer their tax credits. But even if

however, applies as if it had been in force from the very first moment that each facility commenced its regulatory
life. In my opinion that retroactive projection, which sets aside the in tempore application of the system in force
prior to [2014], as though the latter had never existed, and the fact that the new regulation is considerably less
favourable for the facilities concerned, amount to a serious abuse of judicial certainty...”. See also above, paragraphs
210-212.

they had such right, the new legislation did not revoke or cancel it, let alone retroactively:
the claimants were still entitled to the full amount of their tax credits. Only the conditions
under which they could be relied on were modified, inter alia by sharply lowering the
annual cap. The tribunal added that the new legislation “would have been retroactive [...]
if it had come to reintroduce, into income tax, part of the deductions previously made, or

[...] if it had supressed existing credits.”°*°

The decision concerned a situation remote from the present one: it involved an
expropriation claim under a BIT, not a claim to breach of the legal stability guarantee in
Article 10 of the ECT. However, the passage italicized above shows that the distinction
between immediately operative and retrospective measures is a far from simple one.
There is an analogy between a law which disallows deductions already made (affecting
future tax liabilities) and a law which deducts subsidies already lawfully paid from future

entitlements to subsidies.

Different tribunals in Spanish RE cases have reached different conclusions on the
retrospectivity point. In Charanne, which concerned only the 2010 regulations, the
tribunal rejected the retrospectivity argument, which the claimants there had presented in
the form of a claim to a vested right that the regulatory framework could not be altered ‘in
any way’. The tribunal formulated the question as being “to what extent the State can
modify, with immediate effect, generally applicable regulatory provisions”.*! But
although some claimants may have put it in these terms, that is not the question. The
Tribunal agrees that there was no contractual right or legitimate expectation to an
unchanging subsidy, and it agrees that (subject to considerations of proportionality)
Article 10.1 did not preclude new regulations from having immediate effect. But it is one

thing to give new regulatory measures immediate effect for existing installations, and

quite another to eliminate future subsidies otherwise payable by reference to amounts

lawfully paid and received in earlier years on a quite different basi

  

The /solux tribunal took a similar position, also relying on Nations Energy v. Panama.°**

The matter was central to the decision in RREEF v. Spain. The tribunal there emphasized
that the claimants acquired a right to a “general regime guaranteeing the essential
advantages they could reasonably expect when they made their investments.”°**
Furthermore, the tribunal had “no hesitation to find that the Respondent acted in breach
of its obligation to respect the principle of stability” by applying the Disputed Measures
retroactively.°** More precisely, according to the tribunal, the Disputed Measures took
into account past remuneration under the previous regime and deducted them from future
payments. This has the effect of clawing back remuneration to which the investor had a

right at the time the payment was made.**

The Tribunal agrees with this analysis.®° In its view, the subsidies paid in earlier years
were duly paid and duly taken into account in the operation of the SPVs, in their financing
and (presumably) their taxation arrangements. To claw back those profits on the basis of
a subsequent judgment that they were ‘excessive’ was inconsistent with the principle of
stability in Article 10.1 of the ECT and has not been shown to have been necessary to
resolve the tariff deficit problem, which would have been solved in any event by the
Disputed Measures without much further delay and without the element of claw-back of

payments earlier lawfully made. It may have been reasonable to take into account, in

2 Jsolux v. Spain (Award), para. 814, RL-0088, cited in Resp. C-Mem., para. 991.

Ibid, paras. 328-329. The tribunal was unanimous on this point.

686 Tt may be observed that in its comment of 18 June 2019 in response to the RREEF decision, Spain asserts (without
specifically mentioning the claw-back issue) that “the Tribunal will find the most similarities with the case at hand
in the RREEF Decision” (para. 2), and refers to its “correct damages approach” (para. 57). The Claimants reply that
the RREEF tribunal awarded compensation in that case for “losses incurred as a consequence of the retroactive nature
of Regulatory Framework 3” (Response of 18 June 2019, para. 56) while arguing that there were other breaches.

calculating subsidies going forward, the 7.398% that the Plants were deemed to be entitled
to under the Disputed Measures. To count against them the amounts previously earned in
excess of that threshold was to penalise the Plants for their successful operation during
those years. For these reasons, the Tribunal would, if EU law as part of the applicable law

so allows, hold that Spain breached Article 10.1 of the ECT by this claw-back operation.°*”
(x) Overall proportionality of the Disputed Measures

Turning to the overall proportionality of the Disputed Measures, it is necessary to analyse
their impact on the returns generated by the Claimants’ investments. This is without
prejudice to the conclusion, just arrived at, as to retrospectivity. On that basis the question
is whether the Disputed Measures, had they been applied pro futuro, without the element
of seizure of assets lawfully acquired in previous years under the Special Measures, would

have been considered proportionate and consistent with Article 10.1 and 2.

For reasons already given (paragraphs 467-476 above), this Tribunal agrees with the
RREEF tribunal that the only legitimate expectation the Claimants could have had was
that of a ‘reasonable return’ in terms of Law 54/1997.°** In particular, the Tribunal does
not consider that the Claimants had a legitimate expectation to the regime of RD 661/2007,
which (a) was not in force when all the investments were made by the Claimants, (b) was

not the subject of a stabilization regime, and (c) was subordinate to Law 54/1997.

In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the decision in RREEF v. Spain that the Claimants

are entitled to...

compensation for unreasonable return on their investments — if
established —, the Claimants cannot claim full compensation for the

extent that such decrease is below the threshold of a reasonable
return.°°

500. The RREEF tribunal conducted its proportionality analysis under the rubric ‘The Principle
of Damages’ in the section of its decision dealing with quantum. It did so on the ground
that “the determination of a violation of the principles of proportionality and
reasonableness is inseparable from an assessment of the damages — if any — endured by
the Claimants as a consequence of the measures taken by the Respondent”.° The two
are closely connected in practice, but nonetheless the question of disproportionality
pertains to the merits — whether there has been a breach in the first place — and not to
issues of quantum, which are consequential. This difference of principle is important in
practice because it is only if the breach is identified with precision that the question of

reparation for that breach can be approached.

501. It is notable that the Parties and their experts treated the question of quantum in an
essentially undifferentiated way, as the amount of loss suffered by the Claimants as a
result of the Disputed Measures globally. That led them to identify the amount of
reparation owing by reference to an undifferentiated ‘but for’ situation.”! For the
Claimants’ experts this was the status quo ante, the regime of RD 661/2007 as amended.
But if the Claimants had no right to the continuation of that regime, they cannot have
acquired any such right by reference to the secondary rules of reparation. The venerable
dictum of the Permanent Court in Chorzéw Factory does not guarantee the continuation
of a factual situation (the Special Regime) to which the Claimants were not otherwise

entitled.°?

502. The question thus becomes whether the Disputed Measures operated...

in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the
legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable
reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial
resources on the basis of the earlier regime.°

503. To examine the proportionality of the Disputed Measures, the Tribunal agrees with the

RREEFF tribunal that the relevant measure is the internal rate of return (IRR):

Since the Tribunal has determined that the only legitimate
expectation of which the Claimants could prevail themselves was
that of a ‘reasonable return’, it is appropriate to compare both
regimes depending on the IRR that the Claimants can get under each
of them. As the Novenergia tribunal put it, ‘the internal rates of
return is a relevant measurement for what the Claimants was
expecting to get from its investment in the Kingdom of Spain at the
time of making the investment.”

504. According to the Respondent’s experts, the IRR equates to the “reasonable return” as
provided for by the provisions of the Spanish regulatory regime.®> Investors take the IRR
into account and compare it to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to decide on
the profitability of a potential investment.*” If the project IRR is higher than the required
rate of return it follows that the cash flows generated by the investment will cover the
costs associated with the project.®” In principle, the Tribunal agrees with this assessment.
If the project IRR exceeds a reasonable return, the Disputed Measures would be

proportionate and would not breach Article 10.1 of the ECT.

As stated by the Parties, there is a difference between the project IRR and the shareholder
IRR. Whereas the ECT protects shareholders’ rights and accords different protection
standards to them, the Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the relevant IRR targeted by
the legitimate expectation to a reasonable return is the project IRR over the useful lifetime

of the plants.

Yet the Parties do not agree on the project IRR under the Special Regime. This Tribunal
need not determine the exact IRR before the entry into force of the Disputed Measures.
Nonetheless, it notes that the IRR under the new incentives regime is lower than under the
initial regime, and not surprisingly. As already held by the Tribunal, the Respondent has
the right to modify and amend its regulations, i.e. the amount of the targeted IRR, as long

as they remain reasonable and do not breach the ECT.

The RREFF tribunal calculated a reasonable rate of return at 6.86% after tax, including a

1% supplementary premium.°*

The Tribunal does not take any position on the exact amount of the reasonable return
under the Disputed Measures. This return can change over time depending on various
factors. The Respondent emphasizes that the reasonable return is a dynamic concept.°”
The Tribunal agrees. The term ‘reasonable’ allows the State to accommodate a change in
these factors instead of fixing the IRR at a certain number. Nonetheless, the Tribunal notes
that even if the Claimants had a legitimate expectation of an IRR of 6.86% after tax, the

actual IRR clearly exceeded that amount.

The Parties’ positions as to the Project IRR and the reasonable rate of return are set out in

the table below:

The Tribunal notes that the Parties neither agree on the total project IRR, nor on the

reasonable rate of return.

According to the Claimants’ experts, the project IRR under the Disputed Measures of
wind farms in Spain is 7.08%, whereas the estimated reasonable rate of return for RE

producers is 9.40%. Consequently, the financial damage in terms of IRR is 2.32%.”

According to the Respondent’s experts, the actual project IRR is 8.88% for wind farms
under the Disputed Measures.””! Considering that the reasonable rate of return for
renewable energy projects is 7%, no negative impact on the Claimants’ investment can be
seen.’? Even under the Claimants’ experts’ ‘prevailing scenario’ the project IRR would

be 8.03%, which does not entail a negative impact on the investment.

As to the reasonable rate of return of 9.40% put forward by the Claimants, the Tribunal
notes that KPMG did not take into account the Disputed Measures but based its
calculations solely on what the Claimants could allegedly expect.’ The Tribunal has
already decided that the Claimants had no right to the continuation of the Special Regime.
Hence, it cannot base its calculation solely on RD 661/2007, and the reasonable rate of

return calculated by KPMG must be rejected.

The average of both total IRRs after the enactment of the Disputed Measures is 7.98%,
which is above the 7.398% pre-tax target of the Spanish regulator. It is also above the
RREFF tribunal’s reasonable rate of return of 6.86%.

The Tribunal therefore decides that the Respondent has not breached its obligation to
ensure a reasonable return for the future. Accordingly, the Claimants’ legitimate

expectation to a reasonable return has not been frustrated.

(4) Spain’s alleged breaches of Article 10.1 of the ECT, third sentence

The Claimants also argue that the Disputed Measures breached Article 10.1 third sentence,
ECT, which provides that the investments “shall also enjoy the most constant protection
and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or

discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal”.’°4

(a) The Claimants’ position

The Claimants maintain that Article 10.1 third sentence contains a protection standard
equivalent to what is more commonly called “full protection and security”.”° This
standard protects the physical integrity of the investor and must be understood as an
obligation to provide a “secure legal investment environment” including legal stability
and security.’°° Even if the Tribunal considered the ECT not to oblige Spain to provide
legal security, the Claimants invoke the MFN clause as contained in Article 10.7 of the
ECT to invoke the full protection and security (“FPS”) provisions of various other BITs
the Respondent has concluded. The Claimants argue that said clauses also oblige Spain to

ensure legal stability.”

521.

The Claimants put forward three reasons to argue that the Disputed Measures did create
legal uncertainty. First, Spain enacted eight pieces of legislation, which altered the original
Incentives Regime and “dashed the stable framework it had rationally developed”.”*
Second, between July 2013 and 31 May 2014, all RE producers received payments on an
interim basis since the new regime had not been entirely shaped until the enactment of
MOIET/1045/2014. Third, the Respondent will change the new regime periodically every
three and six years.” Finally, the Claimants argue that the Disputed Measures
“considerably devaluated” the investment, which breaches Spain’s obligation to provide

a secure investment environment.”!°

Furthermore, the Claimants argue that Spain has impaired their investment with

unreasonable and discriminatory measures.’!!

First, the Disputed Measures are
unreasonable since they breached the Claimants’ expectations for a “stable, certain and
consistent” regulatory framework. Moreover, the amount of the target return of 7.398% is
unjustified and “does not reflect correctly the capital cost of the most efficient companies”.
Second, the Claimants maintain that the TVPEE is not an environmental tax and does not
contribute to its alleged objective. Third, the TVPEE has a discriminatory impact on the

investment.’!?

As a result, the Disputed Measures are, according to the Claimants, in breach of Article
10.1 third sentence.
(b) The Respondent’s position

The Respondent rejects the claim. Spain argues that it agrees with the Claimants insofar

as the standard protects the investor against physical harm. However, the Claimants erred

“in not distinguishing this standard from that of the FET”.”'° Furthermore, the Respondent
has already proven (i) that it had the right to adopt macro-economic control measures and

(ii) that the Disputed Measures are proportionate and reasonable.’!*

As to the Claimants’ arguments relating to the reasonableness and discriminatory nature

of the Disputed Measures, the Respondent makes three points.

First, the prevailing economic circumstances required Spain to adopt the Disputed
Measures.’!> Second, the RE sector proposed a change of the remuneration method
itself.’'® Third, both national and foreign investors accepted the Disputed Measures and

considered them reasonable and attractive.”!”

Finally, the Respondent relies on EDF v. Romania and AES Summit v. Hungary in support
of the proposition that the Disputed Measures were neither discriminatory nor

unreasonable.7!

According to the test in EDF v. Romania, the Disputed Measures are not discriminatory
in nature as they i) serve a legitimate purpose, which is the resolution of the unsustainable
tariff deficit, ii) are in full compliance with Spanish law, iii) were taken so serve a

disguised purpose, iv) respected the rules of due process.”!?

According to the test in AES Summit v. Hungary, the Disputed Measures are reasonable
as they i) are rational and meet the objective of a public economic policy and ii)

contributed to the resolution of the public policy objective.’”°

For these reasons, the Respondent maintains that the Disputed Measures did not breach

Article 10.1 third sentence.

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis

The focus of Article 10.1 third sentence of the ECT is on constant protection and security.
In that regard, the State needs to ensure that “the management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal of the investment is not impaired by unreasonable or discriminatory

measures”.

Article 10.1 third sentence appears to have a twofold sense. In the first place, it obliges
the State to ensure the physical protection of the investor and to protect it against physical
violence and harassment; in this respect, at least, it is not a re-statement of the fair and
equitable treatment standard in different words. This was the view of similar clauses taken
by numerous tribunals, including Noble Ventures v. Romania,’?! Tecmed v. Mexico,’””

APL v. Sri Lanka,’”> Wena Hotels v. Egypt,’* AMT v. Zaire,’ and Eureko v. Poland.’?6

In the ELSI case, a Chamber of the ICJ interpreted the terms “the most constant protection
and security” included in a bilateral treaty. It focused on whether the plant and machinery
at stake suffered any material damage or harm and rejected the claim as there was no proof
of “any deterioration in the plant and machinery” and the authorities were able to protect

the plant.’?”

Here there is no evidence that BayWa’s investment has suffered from any physical harm

or deterioration through the Disputed Measures and BayWa has not suggested otherwise.

534.

Moreover, there is no evidence that BayWa’s management, maintenance, use, enjoyment
or disposal of the Wind Plants, as distinct from its income and thus its value, have been
impaired by the change of the Incentives Regime. Hence, the Claimants’ attempt to invoke
various other FPS clauses — through the ECT’s MFN clause — to argue that Spain has the

obligation to ensure legal stability, must also fail.

Secondarily, the provision expressly refers to unreasonable or discriminatory measures. If
this were a free-standing obligation, it would overlap considerably if not completely with
the obligations contained in the first two sentences of Article 10.1. On this basis, it would
not lead to a different result than they do. In the Tribunal’s view, unreasonable or
discriminatory measures in the general sense are examples of measures that may breach
the FET standard as contained in Article 10.1, first and second sentences. In this regard,
the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent. Moreover, it agrees with the tribunal in RREEF,
which analysed the alleged discriminatory character of the Disputed Measures and issues
of proportionality and reasonableness as part of the FET claim.’”* The RREEF tribunal
decided that:

there can be no doubt that [...], (iii) non-impairment including (iv)
non-discrimination and (v) proportionality and reasonableness, are
elements of the FET — and certainly so under the ECT.’

As to the FET standard, the Tribunal has already decided that the retroactive aspect of the

Disputed Measures breached the FET standard under the ECT.

Nothing further accordingly remains to be decided as regards the claims under Article

10.1, third sentence.

(5) The EU state aid arguments

For these reasons the Tribunal concludes that, to the extent the Disputed Measures were
applied to claw back subsidies duly paid before their adoption, they breached the stability
guarantee in Article 10.1 first and second sentence of the ECT. In all other respects there
was no breach of Article 10.1. But, as already noted (paragraphs 409, 463 and 496 above),
this conclusion concerns the ECT in the absence of EU law, notably that concerning state

aid. To this the Tribunal turns.

The Tribunal has already considered and dismissed the generic EU law arguments based
on the preclusive effect of EU law and supported by reference to the Achmea decision.”*°
It follows from that discussion that, for the purposes of the ECT which forms the basis of
this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, Parts III and V continue to apply to the Claimants’
investments. But EU law, according to Spain, also has a specific relevance to the claim,
in that EU state aid law, which is part of Spanish law, has the effect that the Claimants did
not have, and could not have had, any legitimate expectation of receiving Special Regime
subsidies, still less that they were fixed at the level of RD 661/2007. Moreover, the EC’s
decision of 10 November 2017 authorizing the Disputed Measures as permissible state aid
specifies that compliance with any award of this Tribunal requiring Spain to make
payments in excess of those provided by those Measures would itself constitute
impermissible state aid and would trigger the stand-still obligation in Article 108.3

TFEU.”"!

The Parties elaborated further in their responses of 13 January 2018 and 29 January 2018
to the EC’s Decision on State Aid which after a short round of written observations and
in accordance with the Tribunal’s decision of 23 December 2017 became part of the record

of this arbitration, even though the EC in the end did not intervene.”° On 4 May 2018, the

Parties set out their positions in further written submissions on EU law and current

developments.

On 22 and 23 May 2018, a hearing took place in The Hague to address among others the
state aid issue. 7° Before setting out its views on these issues, the Tribunal will first

summarise the arguments thereby presented.

(a) The EC’s applications and the positions of the Parties

In its Applications for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party, the EC argued that its
intervention “may in particular be warranted if the [Disputed] [M]easures at stake were to
involve State aid in the sense if Article 107 (1) Treaty on the Functioning of [the]
European Union, and the investors claim in that regard legitimate expectations.””**
According to the EC, in accordance with the consistent jurisprudence of the CJEU, a
recipient of aid cannot have had any legitimate expectation that the incentives regime was
lawful. This entailed that the Claimants could not have the legitimate expectation that aid

be granted.”

Finally, in the EC’s Decision on State Aid, the EC reiterated that if Spain were to comply
with an award in favour of the Claimants, the payment would constitute state aid under

Article 108.3 TFEU and would be subject to the standstill obligation.’*°

The Claimants put forward three reasons to reject Spain’s argument that it could not have
developed any legitimate expectations in the matter due to the incompatibility of the
Special Regime with EU law on state aid. First, the Claimants had the legitimate
expectation that Spain would act in compliance with EU state aid law and that the
incentives regime did not constitute state aid. Second, Spain did notify the Disputed

Measures but only after a considerable delay, during which the Claimants had developed

543.

legitimate expectations. Third, the Claimants do not have an obligation to oversee if the

Respondent respected its EU obligations.

As to the first reason, the Claimants argue that they had the legitimate expectations that
Spain and the EC had acted in compliance with EU state aid law. The CJEU declared in
the PreussenElektra decision that “a national scheme mandating that minimum prices
should be paid to sellers of energy generated from renewable sources was not inconsistent
[with] and did not infringe 107 of the [TFEU].””*’ This is the basis on which Claimants
were entitled to believe that the incentives regime did not constitute state aid.’** This is
supported by the fact that between 2003 and 2014 the EC did not raise any objections to
regimes providing for returns of 13%-15% after taxes for wind and solar support
schemes.”*? In this regard, the EC did not take any action when many other incentive
schemes were introduced by EU Member States, only some of which were notified.
Hence, at the time of the investment (2003 and 2011) the Claimants invested believing
that the incentive regime did not constitute state aid under EU law.”“° Even the Respondent
admits that “until recently” the situation was unclear.”4! Only in 2013, the CJEU
definitively ruled in Vent de colére! against schemes financed by consumers but organised
by the State.“ This was confirmed later in Elcogds.’4* However, at the time of the

investment, Claimants had the legitimate expectation that everything was in order.”+

As to the second reason, the Claimants refer to the delay between the entry into force of
the Disputed Measures and the EC’s Decision on State Aid. According to the CJEU, an

“unexplained 26 month delay on the part of the Commission in adopting its decision on

the legality of the aid conferred a legitimate expectation.””*° The EC notified its decision
to Spain on 14 November 2017. Meanwhile, the Claimants had developed the expectation
that that the incentives regime was not state aid and could be declared compatible. Since

the decision came too late, it is of no relevance to the case and adds nothing new.746

544. As to the third reason, the Claimants argue that they had no obligation to carry out due
diligence assessing whether Spain had complied with its obligations and notified the
incentives regime to the EC or not. According to the CJEU there is no specific obligation
of the recipient to oversee whether the State has complied with its obligations under EU
law.”*7 Furthermore, the Respondent did not respect its obligation to notify the incentives
regime to the Commission. Spain, by omitting to notify, was in breach of international

law, a breach for which BayWa does not have to account.748

545. Finally, the Claimants argue that the project companies do not have to refund the aid they

received. If they had the legitimate expectation that the aid was lawful, they do not have

id.

to refund the ai Hence, the courts of EU Member States, and a fortiori this Tribunal,

are not bound by any decision of the EC. In exceptional circumstances the courts can

decide against the EC’s Decision on State Aid and allow the recipient to keep the aid.’°°

546. Spain stresses four points in relation to the state aid issue, while generally endorsing the

EC’s position.

547. First, Spain reiterates that the Claimants did not have and could not have had any

legitimate expectations of receipt of Special Regime subsidies.”"! The EC has declared the

incentives regime to constitute state aid. The consequence of this declaration, which is
binding on the Tribunal under the applicable law, is not the repayment of the subsidies to
Spain (which the EC has not ordered) but the exclusion of any legitimate expectations to
the payment of the state aid. Therefore, the Claimants’ legitimate expectations have not
been breached. Despite the fact that the Special Regime was never notified by Spain, it
fulfilled all the criteria of state aid. It must be considered to constitute state aid since 2001,

which is long before the Claimants’ investment.’>*

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimants could have neither had the legitimate
expectation to endlessly receive any aid nor to receive a certain amount.’*? The incentives

regime will always remain subjected to the control of the European Commission:

Indeed, according to Article 108, the Member States are always
obliged, jointly with the European Commission, to review and to
control the supportive schemes. That is why no investor could have
a legitimate expectation to receive a specific level of state aid
without an end, because that level of state aid will be always subject
to the control of the European Commission, and therefore can be
changed at any moment. That is why the European Commission
concludes that there is no right to state aid, and therefore an investor
cannot have a legitimate expectation to state aid, and even less could
have a specific expectation when the state aid scheme has not been
notified to the European Commission.”**

Third, the Tribunal must apply the standard of a diligent businessman. According to this
standard, any investor must know that any incentives regime can be abolished at any time
according to EU law. Therefore, the Claimants cannot have any legitimate expectations to

receive state aid.”*> Furthermore, the CJEU states that an investor is obliged to know

which rules are applicable to its investment. As a result, the investor has to take into

account the behaviour of the State and the applicable law, which includes state aid law.7*°

Fourth, the EC’s Decision on State Aid is directed at Spain’s incentives scheme and hence

to all investors and companies that have benefited from the system.’*”

Moreover, the Claimants rebut the Respondent’s PreussenElektra argument by referring
to Elcogds, which stated that PreussenElektra cannot be applied to facts similar to those
before this Tribunal. This is because in PreussenElektra, no “regulation or mechanism

regulated by the state to manage the payments” was involved, as it is in the case at hand.”**

Finally, Spain emphasises that the EC expressly stated in its Decision on State Aid that
any compensation awarded to the investments would constitute unauthorised state aid
pursuant to Article 108.3 TFEU. Therefore, an award in the Claimants’ favour could not

be enforced, at least within the EU.”
(b) The Tribunal’s approach

(i) EU law on state aid

The Tribunal will first summarise what it understands, on the basis of the submissions of

the Parties and the referenced documents, to be the applicable EU law of state aid.
Article 107.1 TFEU provides that:

any aid granted by a Member State or through State resources in any
form whatsoever which distorts or threatens to distort competition
by favouring certain undertakings or the production of certain goods

shall, in so far as it affects trade between Member States, be
incompatible with the internal market.

There are certain exceptions to the prohibition in Article 107.1, none of them relevant

here.

Article 107.3 sets out criteria to be applied by the EC in approving state aid proposals. If
a proposal is not approved, it must be withdrawn or duly modified, an injunction

enforceable by the CJEU (Article 108.2).

Article 108.1 requires the EC, in cooperation with Member States, to “keep under constant

review all systems of aid existing in those States”. In accordance with Article 108.3:

The Commission shall be informed... of any plans to grant or alter
aid. If it considers that any such plan is not compatible with the
internal market having regard to Article 107, it shall without delay
initiate the procedure provided for in paragraph 2. The Member
State concerned shall not put its proposed measures into effect until
this procedure has resulted in a final decision.

State aid which is not notified under Article 108.3 or which is implemented before it is
authorised by the EC is unlawful. Unlawful aid can and in principle should be recovered
by the EC, which can require its repayment by all recipients to the granting State. But the
failure to notify aid, though it makes the aid unlawful, does not entail that the EC may not
subsequently find the aid compatible with the internal market: this is what happened with
the Disputed Measures, which were notified by Spain only some time after their
implementation. In approving them in its Decision on State Aid, the EC confined itself to
‘lamenting’ the late notification. It could have ordered the payment of interest on

amounts paid prior to the approval date, but did not do so.

The question whether particular payments constitute aid as defined is a matter of law for

the EC, State courts and ultimately the CJEU. The onus is on the recipient to ascertain

760 EC’s Decision on State Aid, p. 33, RL-0107.

210

whether the aid has been notified, which it can do by consulting the on-line register of

aid.”°! Moreover, it is well established that:

so long as the Commission has not taken a decision approving aid,
and so long as the period for bringing an action against such a
decision has not expired, the recipient cannot be sure as to the
lawfulness of the proposed aid which alone is capable of giving rise
to a legitimate expectation on his part.’

560. This principle is of long-standing. For example, in 1997, the Court held:

[...] in view of the mandatory nature of the supervision of State aid
by the Commission under Article 93 [now 108] of the Treaty,
undertakings to which an aid has been granted cannot, in principle,
entertain a legitimate expectation that the aid is lawful unless it has
been granted in compliance with the procedure laid down in that
article. A diligent operator should normally be able to determine
whether that procedure has been followed.’°

561. In the EU state aid context, the relevance of legitimate expectations is that they can, in

certain limited circumstances, constitute a defence to a claim for repayment of aid.”
(ii) The application of state aid law to the Special Regime

562. The Claimants argue that neither Spain nor the EC discussed the nature of the Disputed
Measures until 2017, when the EC’s Decision on State Aid was rendered. However, the
two Directives on Renewable Energy of 2001 and 2009 both expressly refer to Articles

87-88 TFEU,’® and the EC, in implementing these Directives, has approved a large

761 EC register of state aid decisions: http://ec.europa.ew/competition/state_aid/register/.

number of subsidies schemes for renewable energy. The matter was put by the EC in 2005

in the following terms:

As stated in indent 12 of the preamble of Directive 2001/77/EC, the
tules of the Treaty, and in particular Articles 87 and 88 thereof,
apply to public support. Such support is normally covered by the
Community Guidelines on State aid for Environmental Protection
and might be economically justified on a number of grounds as the
beneficial effects of such measures on the environment outweigh the
distorting effects on competition. Since the use of renewable energy
sources is a priority in the policy of the Community, the mentioned
guidelines are rather generous for such support schemes. On that
basis, some 60 State aid schemes supporting renewable energy
sources were approved by the Commission during the period 2001
to 2004.76

563. In fact, it does not appear that any green energy subsidy scheme was disapproved by the
EC during this period. The EC register of state aid lists only five negative decisions,
involving Austria (20117’), France (201678 and 2018’*) and Germany (2015’” and
201877'). None of these schemes bore any resemblance to the Spanish Special Regime in

force up to 2013.

564. Thus, it appears to have been the case that state aid rules were in principle applicable, but

that the EC took a ‘rather generous’ approach to their application.

As to whether the Special Regime subsidies constituted state aid as defined, the Claimants
argued that at the time of the investment, both Parties and the EC assumed that they did
not. However, the Guidelines of 2001 point in a contrary direction. Although the cost of
the subsidies was intended to be met by consumers, the Spanish State provided for them
by law and was closely involved in the operation of the system. The EC in its Decision
on State Aid had no difficulty in holding that the Disputed Measures constituted state aid,
and by parity of reasoning so did the Special Regime. The CJEU’s decision in
PreussenElektra, which the Claimants cited in this context, is plainly distinguishable.”””
The Tribunal concludes that the Special Regime potentially constituted state aid and

should have been notified to the EC under Article 108 TFEU.

The Claimants point out that the EC never condemned the Special Regime subsidies as
state aid, still less did it require their repayment by the large number of recipients of
subsidies. The Respondent asserts that it follows from the EC’s 2017 decision on the
Disputed Measures that the Claimants can have had no legitimate expectation of receiving

subsidies in excess of those provided for by those Measures, or indeed at all.

 

The EC’s Decision on State Aid held that payments made under the Disputed Measures
from their inception in 2014 until 10 November 2017 were state aid and, not having been
notified, were unlawful.’ After examination, it decided that the aid was compatible with
the internal market pursuant to Article 107.3.c TFEU. As for existing facilities,
“[p]ayments under the premium economic scheme are covered by the decision in order to

assess proportionality, i.e. the absence of overcompensation”.’”* But it was “not relevant

for the scope of this decision to assess whether the originally foreseen payments under the

previous schemes would have been compatible or not

775,

568. A preliminary question for the Tribunal is the relevance, if any, of the EC’s intimation or

decision that compliance with any damages award in the present case would by itself

constitute notifiable state aid, subject to the standstill obligation.”° In this regard the

Tribunal agrees with the Vattenfall tribunal:

[...] While the Tribunal is mindful of the duty to render an
enforceable decision and ultimately an enforceable award, the
Tribunal is equally conscious of its duty to perform its mandate
granted under the ECT... The enforceability of this decision is a
separate matter which does not impinge upon the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.””

569. Turning to the substantive question of the interaction of EU law and the applicable law

for this Tribunal founded on the ECT, the following observations should be made:

(a)

In principle, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation of treatment which
is unlawful under the law of the host State, provided that the host State law itself
is not inconsistent with the treaty under which the tribunal exercises its
jurisdiction.” In an international forum such as the present one, a host State may
not rely on its domestic law as a ground for non-fulfilment of its international

obligations.’”? But subject to that qualification, investors must also comply with

the law of the host State, both as regards their investment and their concomitant

expectations.

In the present case, the host state’s law itself (incorporating EU state aid rules) is
not inconsistent with the ECT, under which the Tribunal exercises its jurisdiction.
Although arguably harsh on recipients as they risk bearing the harmful
consequences of the subsidizing State’s omission to notify the aid, the EU rules in
regard of non-notified aid are clear and have been consistently interpreted. From
the standpoint of international law, “municipal laws are merely facts which
express the will and constitute the activities of States, in the same manner as do
legal decisions or administrative measures”.”*° The Tribunal therefore does not
interpret EU law as such, but accepts the consistent interpretation of EU law as

applied by the relevant institutions.

The initial investments here were made in the period between 2008 and 2011, after
a due diligence process which seems not to have had any regard to EU state aid
law. As it is at least arguable that state aid law should have been seen as relevant

even at that time, the Tribunal finds this omission surprising.

The EC, which had primary responsibility for administering and enforcing state
aid law, was well-informed as to the Spanish special subsidy regime in its various
manifestations under Law 54/1997. Indeed it extolled the Special Regime as “the
main driver for investment in wind energy” and as “rather well adjusted to
generation cost”.’*! There is no indication that it did anything to raise with Spain
the state aid issue until the Disputed Measures were belatedly raised by Spain itself
in December 2014, well after the cessation of Special Regime subsidies and the

repeal of Law 54/1997.

(e) Spain, an EU member since 1986, ought to have been aware of its duty of
notification under Article 108.3 TFEU, and should have acted accordingly. There
is, however, no causal link between the omission to notify and the fact that the
Claimants have not continued to receive the amount of subsidies provided for in
RD 661/2007. The illegality of unnotified Special Regime subsidies played no
role in subsequent events, including the enactment of the Disputed Measures,

which were driven by purely domestic concerns, notably the tariff deficit.

(f) Despite its detailed knowledge of the Special Regime, the EC for its part has taken
no steps to enforce the relevant provisions of EU law against the recipients of
subsidies generally. Instead it has elected to seek to block the payment of any
award of ECT and BIT tribunals, including this Tribunal, as constituting de novo
a form of state aid. It will be for the Parties through subsequent proceedings to
work through the consequences of the Tribunal’s award under EU law and
international law, including by reference to the provisions of the ICSID
Convention concerning the status and enforcement of awards.’*? The Tribunal can

do nothing but decide the present case in accordance with the applicable law.

(g) In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds that under EU law and the law of Spain,
the Claimants could not legitimately have expected that the Special Regime
subsidies were lawful. Equally they could not expect that the amount of state aid
granted under these measures would be paid for the lifetime of the plants. The
Claimants should have known that these measures had not been notified to, let

alone approved by, the EC.

(h) However, the EC has equally not rendered a decision that the Special Regime

subsidies were unlawful. It merely stated, with full knowledge of the facts, that it

was ‘not relevant’ whether the previous scheme was compatible with EU law. As
such, the EC has not created a right (still less a duty) for Spain to procure the
reimbursement of amounts of state aid already paid, including to the Claimants’
Wind Farms and other recipients. Nor, in the light of the record, does the Tribunal
believe that EU law required only the level of subsidy provided by the Disputed
Measures. The EC, which has quite broad discretion in such matters, made no

such finding.

(i) The Tribunal has already held that no compensation is due to the Claimants for the
non-continuation after 2013 of the level of state aid under the Special Regime that
was in force before 2013. But the position with respect to claw-back of subsidies
paid under the Special Regime is not, in the Tribunal’s view, to be treated in the
same way. Recipients of such subsidies could not have had a legitimate
expectation that they would be continued, but the subsidies having been paid (and
subject to any lawful recovery measures by the EC, which did not occur), they
were entitled to the benefit of the stable regime which Article 10.1, first and second

sentences, of the ECT promised.

Indeed, the effect of the non-application in practice of the law as to unnotified state aid is
that continuing investors such as the Claimants are disadvantaged as compared to those
who benefited from the Special Regime subsidies but who sold their investment prior to
the introduction of the Disputed Measures. In the absence of recovery of the unnotified
aid from all recipients (which has not happened), the latter group retain the benefit of the

earlier subsidies, as reflected in the sale price, without claw back.

This conclusion is consistent with findings of most earlier ECT tribunals in cases against
Spain insofar as these concern jurisdiction and admissibility, as well as responsibility for
expropriation (Article 13), full protection and security (Article 10.1, 3! sentence) and
breach of the umbrella clause (Article 10.1, final sentence). On questions of responsibility

for breach of Article 10.1 first and second sentence, the decisions are variable. Most

217

572.

573.

tribunals have held that there was no specific commitment in terms of RD 661/2007, and
that Article 44.3 of that decree did not constitute an express or implied individual
commitment of the 2007 level of subsidies to the claimant. These cases have already been

referred to in earlier sections of this decision.’*°
Some reference should be made, however, to certain recent cases tendered by the Parties.

In Greentech v. Spain, the tribunal awarded EUR 39 million (out of a claim of EUR 58.2
million) to a Dutch company for breach of Article 10.1, first and second sentences, ECT.
It held that Article 26.6 of the ECT only applies to the merits, not to jurisdiction, and was
therefore irrelevant to the jurisdictional objection based on EU law. That objection it
rejected.’** Claims based on full protection and security and the umbrella clause were
rejected, as also the stabilization claim based on RD 661/2007, in particular Article
44,3.78° There was no expropriation.”*° But there was a breach of Article 10.1, first
sentence, ECT because the new regime involved “a radical or fundamental change in the
legal or regulatory framework under which the investments are made”.’*” This conclusion
was reached despite fallings in due diligence on the part of the investors.’** It was based
on the majority’s conclusion (unaffected by EU law or state aid rules’) that the new
regime met “the threshold requirement of a fundamental change to the regulatory

framework”.”°° The quantum claim was reduced by EUR 11.2 million to reflect a reduced

operating life (30 rather than 35 years for PV facilities) and by EUR 8 million to reflect

claimant’s failure to quantify historical losses.’*!

574. In NextEra v. Spain, the decision of the tribunal on jurisdiction, liability and quantum
principles rejects EU law as a helpful guide in assessing the claims. The case was brought
by Dutch companies owning shares in the Spanish plants operating CSP facilities. The
decision to invest in principle was made in 2009 by preregistration applications, even
though bank financing was only drawn upon in 2011 and the plants were finally registered

and operative only in May-June 2013.” EU law, it was held, cannot affect jurisdiction:

The fact that there may exist a partial overlap between the two set
of rules on the merits (such as FET and Fundamental Freedoms),
cannot, for the purpose of jurisdiction, be resolved in favour of EU
Law. This is because the questions pertaining to the Tribunal
jurisdiction must be answered in light of Article 26 of the ECT.’?

575. The EU jurisdictional objection was thus rejected.” But the TVPEE objection for tax

measures was accepted.”

576. The merits were dealt with more summarily. Respondent’s claim of lack of due diligence

was rejected essentially on onus of proof grounds:

[...] Claimants had the Poyry consultant reports and Claimants refer
to legal opinions they received on Spanish law. The fact that
Claimants refused to waive their privilege in respect those legal
opinions should not lead to any adverse inferences. Nondisclosure
means that Respondent and the Tribunal have not had access to the
content of those opinions, but the fact that Claimants received legal
advice is not really contested. In short, the Tribunal does not

consider that the assertion that there was a lack of due diligence on
the part of Claimants has been established.”

The breach of Article 10.1 was also fairly summarily established:

[...] the assurances made by the Spanish authorities were not about
a reasonable return; they were about the regulatory certainty and
stability that NextEra could expect. The denial of legitimate
expectations is based on the failure to provide that certainty and
security by changing fundamentally the regime under which
remuneration was to be calculated.”””

No reference was made to EU law concerning the merits.

As for quantum, the tribunal rejected the claimant’s DCF calculation based on RD
661/2007, on the ground that less than a year’s actual operation of the plants did not give
any sound basis for a DCF analysis.””* Instead “a calculation of the value of the assets
and a reasonable return on that value is an appropriate method for valuation of loss in this
case.””? In the event, after giving directions on various points, the tribunal called on the
parties’ financial experts to seek to agree on quantum, and eventually awarded EUR 290.6

million as damages plus interest and costs.

In Cube v. Spain,

relating to EU law.*®! The ECT, including Article 16, had general application including

under Article 26.6 of the ECT, because it did not constitute one of the ‘principles of

international law’. In sum:

This Tribunal does not have to apply, or take a decision on any
question of, Spanish law or EU law. Under the provisions
concerning the applicable law that are binding on this Tribunal,
Spanish law and EU law are relevant only as facts in the light of
which the rights and duties of the Parties under the ECT and
international law are to be determined. Thus, for example, the
provisions on EU law concerning State aid are not applied by this
Tribunal, nor does the Tribunal make any decision on their
interpretation. They are relevant only as part of the factual matrix,
and in this case particularly as part of the factual basis for
determinations of how the Claimants could expect to be treated in
respect of their power plants in Spain.5°

But it upheld the third preliminary objection related to taxation measures and the

TVPEE.**

In dealing with the merits, the tribunal held that, when the decisions to build RE plants
were made, the investments were made in reliance on the stability of the RD 661/2007
regime.*°> The Spanish Supreme Court decisions of 2005 and 2006 did not address the
ECT or the claim of legitimate expectations, but were based on the Constitution; they did
not “put the Claimants on notice that the tariffs and premiums established by RD 661/2007

might be reduced or withdrawn contrary to the terms of RD 661/2007 itself”.°°

This conclusion does not imply that Spain had no right to amend RD
661/2007 or that the 2007 Regime was in some sense ‘petrified.’ It
does, however, imply that the balance struck in RD 661/2007
between the interests of consumers and producers of electricity was,
and was intended to be, secured by a regime which investors could
be sure would not be changed for existing plants registered under

 

para. 300.

the Special Regime except in accordance with the procedures set out
in RD 661/2007 — or at least, not changed in a manner that
significantly altered the economic balance that existed at the time
when an investment made in reliance on RD 661/2007 was made.*””

But the intangibility created by the claimants’ reliance on RD 661/2007 was relative, not
absolute. In particular, there was a distinction between legitimate expectations of an
investor in 2008-9 (the PV investments) under the auspices of RD 661/2007 and
investments made in 2011-12 (the hydro investments) after the regulatory changes of
2010-11. There was thus a significant difference between the regulatory risks run in the
two classes of investment: “any reasonable investor would have taken a much more
cautious view of the extent to which the continuation of the existing legal regime could
be relied on, but would not have had reason to expect the complete abandonment of the
>> 808

Special Regime’

The Tribunal does not consider that when they made their
investments in hydro facilities in 2011 and 2012, the Claimants
could reasonably rely on there being no change whatever to the
Special Regime applicable to existing facilities. The Special Regime
was clearly under so much economic pressure as to be unsustainable
as it stood; and adjustments to the Special Regime were to be
expected. Realistically, electricity producers must have recognized
that there was very considerable pressure to reduce their profits and
must have expected that steps in that direction would in fact be
taken?

The changes made up until RDL 2/2013, even considered collectively, did not breach
Article 10.1 of the ECT.*° But the subsequent changes, starting with RDL 9/2013 and
culminating with RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014, “represented a fundamental

change in the economic basis of the relationship between the State and the Claimants”,

and did constitute such a breach.*!!

585. The difference between the earlier and later investments emerged at the quantum stage: in
the tribunal’s words “[u]nlike the PV plants, the representation on which investors were
entitled to rely in 2011-2012 does not extend to the entire working life of the plants: and
it is limited to radical changes.”*'? The tribunal unanimously awarded EUR 2.89 million
in damages in respect of the PV investment, without any regulatory discount, but by

majority awarded a 40% discount in respect of regulatory risk on the hydro claim,

resulting in a grant of EUR 30.81 million in the subsequent final award.*!?

586. Professor Tomuschat dissented on the latter point: in his view...

In general, an investor cannot be deemed to have a vested right to
the continuity of the administrative system according to which a
promised advantage will be provided to it. The guarantee given is a
guarantee of economic value. In what form the relevant advantage
shall be granted is a matter to be determined primarily by the host
State. Therefore, only if it could be shown that the transformation of
the system went so far as to call into question the guarantee of a
reasonable return would the Claimants have a claim to
compensation pursuant to the general rules of responsibility.
According to my analysis of the facts, that demonstration has not
been made.*!*

587. In 9REN v. Spain,*!> the tribunal awarded EUR 42 million to a Luxembourg investor for
a breach of Article 10.1 of the ECT, dismissing all other claims. It held that RD 661/2007

contained a grandfathering clause which gave rise to legitimate expectations as to a stable

incentives regime. The tribunal agreed with UNCTAD that “that legitimate expectations
may arise from ‘rules not specifically addressed to a particular investor but which are put
in place with a specific arm to induce foreign investments and on which the foreign
investor relied on making his investment’.”*!° Based on this, the 9REN tribunal decided
that RD 661/2007 constitutes a clear and specific commitment.®!? However, in the
tribunal’s view, Law 54/1997 stated a general principle, which gave the competence to
the Government to give effect to it by regulation. It was to be implemented by regulations
which would naturally change, and did change, and not in any uniform direction favouring
the recipients.*!* In particular, there was no legitimate expectation that subsidies would
never be reduced or capped. Consequently, RD 611/2007 does not constitute a specific

commitment out of which legitimate expectations can arise.

(6) The Tribunal’s Conclusions on Liability

The jurisprudence on Article 10.1, first and second sentences, ECT, is rather variable.
ECT tribunals have uniformly upheld their jurisdiction notwithstanding Achmea and the
rulings of the EC, although the reasoning has varied somewhat. Inadmissibility arguments
have failed. On the merits, a few tribunals have treated the subsidy level under RD
661/2007 as in effect guaranteed, although that is a minority view. Most tribunals have
sought to distinguish between strict compliance with the status quo before 2013 (which is
not required, absent express commitments by the state) and substantial abandonment of
the system of support altogether (which breaches the ECT standard). State aid issues have

been largely ignored, although with little reasoning.*!”

518 See e.g. paragraphs 108, 127, 166, 169-172.

819 The principal exception amongst the BIT decisions is Arbitrator Rail Vinuesa’s dissent in Greentech: above
paragraph 573. Some tribunals have been content to dismiss EU law arguments as irrelevant to international law
responsibility, but whether an investor has a legitimate expectation at the time of the investment is not a pure question
of international law, quite apart from Art 26.6 of the ECT.

224

590.

There is a division in the decisions as between those tribunals that have granted substantial
amounts by way of compensation (sometimes in the hundreds of millions of EUR) and
those which, on whatever ground, have sought to limit the reparation awarded to some
degree. Relevant factors here have included lack of due diligence on the part of the
investor, increased levels of risk as the problems of the electricity budget deficit
strengthened after 2008, and a sense that some investors have sought to capitalise unduly
on Spain’s generous incentive provisions. On the other hand, while the favourable
Spanish superior court decisions have been cited, they have not generally been applied to

limit compensation awards.

Nonetheless, the Tribunal, by majority, does not discern a general breach of the FET
standard embodied in Article 10.1, first and second sentences, ECT. In reaching this

conclusion the Tribunal takes into account the following matters:

(a) The investment was made by BayWa RE in 2009 and subsequently, at a time when
the economic situation was problematic and was acknowledged as such by

Parliament and the Supreme Court at the time.

(b) In particular, the preamble to RDL 6/2009 referred to “serious problems that, in
the context of the current international financial crisis, [are] seriously affecting the
system and not only putting the financial situation of the companies in the electric
power sector at risk, but also the sustainability of the system itself. This imbalance

is unsustainable”.5”°

(c) There was limited due diligence so far as possible constraints imposed by EU law

were concerned.

(d) No specific or binding representations were made by Spain to the investor as such,

whether before 2009 or subsequently. Legislation is subject to modification as

820 RDL 6/2009, Preamble, C-0399. See also R-0088.

circumstances change, and within broad limits investors take the risk that non-

discriminatory changes in financial subsidies may be necessary.

The Respondent sought to avoid major changes by a series of measures—including
changes in the operating hours qualifying for subsidies, the TVPEE, adding an
access toll to use the transportation and distribution grids and suppressing the feed-
in remuneration regime of RD 661/2007 for new Special Regime facilities. To the
extent that these measures fall within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, they are not
asserted by the Claimants as breaches of Article 10.1 of the ECT. Their claims

focus on the Disputed Measures of 2013-14.

The Disputed Measures present a stronger case of a breach. In one respect at least
— the claw back of subsidies lawfully paid and received — they were in breach of
the FET standard, as the Tribunal has held.’”!_ In other respects, too, they were
vulnerable to criticism, notably for the scale of the reduction in tariffs, even
leaving aside the claw-back. But on the other hand, a substantial support system
survived, with priority of access retained and returns for wind power plants at the
level of an IRR of 7.98%.*” In the circumstances the Tribunal (by majority) does
not regard that aspect of the new system as amounting to unfair and inequitable

treatment.

The Tribunal is reinforced in this conclusion by considerations of European law.
By about 2010, if not earlier, the Special Regime subsidies were at least arguably
state aid and notifiable as such to the EC: the subsidies were not notified, and were
unenforceable as such pending EC approval following notification, which never

happened. This gave them added vulnerability.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

that the European state aid regime and the ECT apply concurrently to the

investment and form part of the applicable law.

that the Special Regime subsidies constituted unnotified state aid which was on
that account unlawful. But the EC never ruled that they were unlawful, never

ordered any recovery and never drew any other legal conclusions from that fact.

that the Claimants could not have had a legitimate expectation that the Special
Regime subsidies, notably in terms of RD 661/2007, would continue to be paid for

the lifetime of its Plants.

that in the circumstances, the clawing back by Spain, after 2013, of subsidies
earlier paid at levels in excess of the amounts that would have been payable under
the Disputed Measures, had they been in force in previous years, was in breach of
the obligation of stability under Article 10.1, first and second sentences, of the

ECT.

that this conclusion is not, as at the date of this Decision, inconsistent with EU law

as applied to the Claimants’ investment.

Arbitrator Grigera Nan dissents as to these conclusions on Article 10.1, for the reasons

explained in the attached dissenting opinion.

The next question is the implications of these conclusions for quantum. To this the

Tribunal turns.

DAMAGES

THE CLAIMANTS?’ POSITION

The Claimants argue that they are entitled to full reparation for the harm suffered because
of the Disputed Measures. They claim reparation for a breach of their rights under the
ECT.* To assess the damage the Tribunal must take into account the date on which the
Disputed Measures entered into force.*™ In doing so, it must use a discounted cash flow
(DCF) analysis.5?° This method has often been applied in ECT disputes by international

tribunals.°”

Under the full reparation standard, according to the Claimants, their damages consist of
two different parts. First there are Past Damages, which are calculated by comparing the
value of the free cash flows under an Actual and a But-For scenario until 31 December
2015. Second, the Claimants claim Future Damages, which consist of the difference in
value of the Claimants’ investment under the Actual and the But-For scenarios.*”” In the
Actual Scenario the experts project how the Claimants’ investment would have performed
if the Disputed Measures applied with full force. In the But-For scenario, the experts

assume that BayWa has the right to receive payments under RD 661/2007.°8

Moreover, the Claimants argue that the DCF method is the relevant method for the
quantification of their damages. Two facts render the method particularly appropriate for

the quantification of damages in ECT arbitrations. First, La Muela is a fully developed

project that has been operating for more than a decade. Second, La Muela has a clear and

established track record.5”

To quantify Past Damages, the Claimants’ expert calculated “the free cash flows denied
to the Project Companies from the date in which the Respondent’s measures came into
effect (January 1, 2013) until the valuation date (December 31, 2015).”8° In total, Past
Damages amount to EUR 16,303,851.53!

To quantify Future Damages, the Claimants’ experts apply a DCF analysis to quantify the
impact of the Disputed Measures on the investment. To do so, they calculate the difference
between the Claimants’ investment under the Actual scenario and a But-For scenario. To
this end, the experts take into account two periods. The first period runs from 2016 until
2027, which constitutes the lifetime of the plants. The second period runs from 2028 until
2043 and takes into account reduced tariffs under RD 661/2007 and higher market prices
as of 2022.8°? In total, Future Damages amount to EUR 45,627,673.333

At the November 2017 Hearing, KPMG updated the total amount of damages on 30
September 2017 taking into account new data. Based on this report, BayWa claims losses,

exclusive of interest, of EUR 70,734,037.5*4

In addition, the Claimants argue that, if the Tribunal held that the Claimants were not
entitled to any more than a “reasonable return”, they would nonetheless be entitled to

damages.** This is because the project IRR under the Disputed Measures of wind farms

in Spain is 7.08%, whereas the estimated reasonable rate of return for RE producers is

9.40%. Consequently, the financial damage in terms of IRR is 2.33%.***

Finally, the Claimants claim post-award interest. The basis of claim is Article 13.1 of the
ECT, which allows for interest to be applied at a “commercial rate established on a market
basis”. In addition, a punitive moratorium component of 2% must be added to ensure

prompt payment of the award.**”

In total, the Claimants’ damages claim amounts to EUR 74 million as of 30 September

2017.83

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent argues that the Claimants have not suffered any damage. Accordingly,
the result of their quantum analysis is that the Claimants cannot claim any
compensation.** Further, Spain maintains its argument that the Claimants’ quantification
is wholly speculative.*#? Moreover, the DCF analysis is not an adequate method to

quantify the Claimants’ damage, even assuming they suffered damage.**!

First, the Respondent criticises the calculation method chosen by KPMG. In Spain’s view
the alleged damage has not been proven, which renders the claimed damages speculative
and hypothetical. Moreover, the Spanish Supreme Court has rendered more than one
hundred judgements rejecting the speculative quantification methods used by the
Claimants. According to the Supreme Court that method “lacks [the] necessary rigour and

certainty”.*?

Furthermore, Spain argues that the DCF method is inappropriate and that the Tribunal
should adopt an asset-based method. In its view, the following circumstances render the

DCF method inadmissible:

(a) is a capital-intensive business with an important asset base.
Virtually the whole of its costs are investment costs in tangible
infrastructures. There are no relevant intangibles to asses.

(b) The high dependence of the cash flows on volatile and
unpredictable exogenous elements, such as the price of the pool,
inter alia.

(c) The financial weakness of the Project Finance structures without
recourse agreed, that excessively levered the wind farms,
compromising and conditioning their viability.*
Taken together, these circumstances lead to the conclusion that the DCF method is
inapplicable. As a result, the Tribunal must apply an asset-based quantification method

taking into account the profitability and book value of the investment.

Moreover, Spain argues that the Claimants’ returns have been higher than the reasonable
rate of return. On Econ One’s calculation, the Claimants’ average IRR after the enactment
of the Disputed Measures amounts to 8.88% before taxes. Compared to the return before
taxes under the Disputed Measures, which is 7.398%, or the reasonable returns calculated
by Econ One, there is no negative impact. As a result, BayWa is not entitled to any

damages.**°

Nonetheless, Econ One performs a subsidiary DCF analysis to show that there has not
been any negative impact on the Claimants’ investment. To compare the Actual Scenario
with a But-For Scenario, Econ One applies similar criteria to KPMG. However, it uses a

lower risk in the Actual Scenario. As to the But-For Scenario, Econ One changes the

parameters of the analysis, taking into account (i) the initial investment, (ii) cash flows
generated by the Projects and (iii) a reasonable return on the initial investment, reaching
a different result compared to KPMG’s analysis. According to Econ One’s DCF analysis,
there is no negative impact of the Disputed Measures on the Claimants’ investment as the

value of the investment has increased by EUR 23.6 million.*4°

The Respondent does not object to the application of pre-award interest. However, it is
necessary to distinguish between pre- and post-award interest. Spain argues that the pre-
award interest rates identified by KPMG are inappropriate and must follow a “risk-free
short term rate” as calculated by Econ One.**’ The post-award interest claimed is punitive
in character and is not allowed under international law. Spain refers to paragraph 4 of the
Commentaries of Article 36 of the Articles on the Responsibility of States for

Internationally Wrongful Acts, which expressly states that:

[...] Compensation corresponds to the financially assessable
damage suffered by the injured State or its nationals. It is not
concerned to punish the responsible State, nor does compensation
have an expressive or exemplary character [...]

Hence the Claimants may not claim a punitive post-award
interest.54

Finally, Spain maintains that the tax gross-up claim is inadmissible and unjustified. This
is for three reasons. First, Article 21 of the ECT contains a tax carve-out, which does not
allow the Claimants to seek compensation for any hypothetical taxes they may have to
pay. Furthermore, the imposition of the tax cannot be attributed to the Respondent under
the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, as the tax is applied to the Respondent by a third
State. It is not an act of the Respondent, and cannot be attributed to Spain. Second, the

Claimants have not submitted any proof as to their obligation to pay taxes on the award

in Germany, where the award would fall under a principle called “participation
exemption”. This exemption allows for the tax-free distribution of profits between parent
companies and their subsidiaries within the EU. Third, this renders the claim “speculative,
contingent and ambiguous”. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the Claimants
have neither submitted any legal grounds for the hypothetical taxation, nor any reports by

tax experts.*4?

As a result, the Claimants are not entitled to claim any damages.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

It follows from the Tribunal’s decisions on jurisdiction and liability that none of the

primary claims of the Parties as to quantum can be accepted.

In terms of jurisdiction, the Claimants’ primary claim includes an amount on account of

TVPEE, which claim the Tribunal has held to be outside its jurisdiction.

In terms of substance, the Claimants’ experts value the claim on the basis of the
“prevailing regulation at the time when the projects were acquired by BayWa”. In other
words, KPMG takes as its base the regulatory framework as reflected in RD 661/2007 as
amended in 2010.°°° The majority of the Tribunal has however held that the Claimants’
investments had no right to subsidies at the level of RD 661/2007, and no legitimate
expectation to such subsidies either. Moreover, even if there had been such an expectation,
the but-for situation would not have been, as the Claimants argue, RD 661/2007, with or

without modification, but something more indeterminate.

It is not, however, necessary to pursue these issues further. The Tribunal has held that the
breach of Article 10.1, first and second sentences, of the ECT is limited to the retroactive

reduction in the allowed return. The question is how to value that amount.

619.

Like the RREFF tribunal, the present Tribunal has not been able, despite its best efforts,
to quantify the amount of this retroactive reduction on the basis of the expert reports and
supporting work papers filed by the Parties’ respective experts. It is, however, satisfied
that the Parties’ experts are qualified and have sufficient knowledge of the case and that
the different results obtained by both experts are a result of the different calculation
methods which they applied. Consequently, the Tribunal decides (by majority) that the
Parties, with the assistance of their experts, shall seek to reach an agreement on the impact
of the unlawful retroactive application of the Disputed Measures, assuming a 25-year
regulatory life for wind plants, but otherwise on the basis that those measures were

consistent with the ECT.

Tf the Parties do not, within 3 months of the date of this Decision, reach agreement on the
amount payable in this respect, either Party may request the Tribunal to decide the
outstanding issues in dispute, in accordance with a prompt briefing schedule. If the Parties
do reach agreement on the amount due, they should report this to the Tribunal in order to
enable it to issue an Award incorporating this Decision and dealing with any residual

issues identified, including costs, thereby terminating the proceedings.

THE TAX GROSS-UP CLAIM

One matter of quantum that can be resolved at this stage is the tax gross-up claim, which

the Tribunal has already held admissible. It remains to consider the merits of that claim.

The Claimants seek compensation for the hypothetical payment of taxes in Germany so
that it can receive full reparation.**! The Respondent rejects the claim on the ground that

it cannot be held liable to pay for tax measures implemented by a third State.

851 Cl. Reply, para. 1241.

620. Atthe November 2017 Hearing, in response to a question from the Tribunal, the Claimants

briefly mentioned the tax gross-up claim.**? During his cross-examination, Mr. Solé

Martin, the Claimants’ expert, admitted that he was not a tax expert.8°3

621. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that, on the evidence now available, there is
uncertainty as to the legal position on damages and taxation.** It is unclear at what point
the damages awarded would have been taxed in the normal course and remitted in whole
or in part to BayWa RE Germany. In this context, it is significant that there appears to be
no precedent for the award of a tax gross-up involving taxation of a third State. In three

cases tribunals have rejected such claims.
622. In Eiser the tribunal noted that it:

[...] received no evidence to show whether or in what amount any
tax might actually be due on a future award and only limited
argument regarding the issues raised by this claim. Given these
circumstances, the Tribunal can make no decision as to whether or
when a tax “gross-up” of the kind claimed here might be
appropriate. Accordingly, this portion of Claimants’ damages claim
must fail.*°°

623. In Masdar the tribunal concluded that:

[...] Claimant failed to provide sufficient evidence for an actual
future obligation imposed by its home jurisdiction to pay taxes on
an award paid by a foreign government. The ‘Tax Advice’ on which
Brattle bases the inclusion of a tax gross-up in its calculations does
not give a categorical answer to the ‘question [...] whether an award
granted for the loss in value of shares in Torresol might be exempt
from Dutch tax under the Dutch participation exemption.’*°°

In Antin the tribunal stated that:

[...] it is for the Claimants to prove whether or in what amount any
tax on compensation determined by a future award may be due.
There is no evidence on the record to prove the type and amount of
tax that may be due on an award of compensation and whether such
tax would be affected by the regime to which the Claimants as
taxpayers are subjected in the given jurisdiction(s). Under these
circumstances, the Tribunal is not in a position to determine whether
there would be a specific tax impact that requires a tax gross-up like
the one claimed by the Claimants. Therefore, this portion of the
Claimants’ damages claim must fail.*°7

The situation in the present case is complicated by uncertainty as to the German tax

position.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants did not substantiate their claim to a tax gross-up. It

is accordingly unnecessary to decide whether in principle such an award could be justified.
For these reasons the Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ claim for a tax gross-up.

As to pre- and post-award interest, this can be left to be agreed by the Parties or determined
in a final award. The Tribunal will simply observe at this stage that, in accordance with
established principle, awards of interest cannot contain a punitive element, but are purely

compensatory.

CONCLUSIONS
For these reasons, the Tribunal finds, by majority:

(a) that the European state aid regime and the ECT apply concurrently to the

investment and form part of the applicable law;

857 Antin v. Spain (Award), para. 673, CL-0234.

236

630.

631.

632.

(b) that the Claimants did not have a legitimate expectation that the Special Regime
subsidies, notably in terms of RD 661/2007, would continue to be paid for the

lifetime of its Plants;

(c) that in the circumstances, the clawing back by Spain, in and after 2013, of
subsidies earlier paid at levels in excess of the amounts that would have been
payable under the Disputed Measures, had they been in force in previous years,
was in breach of the obligation of stability under Article 10.1, first and second

sentences, of the ECT;

(d) that there was no other breach of the ECT;

(e) that all other claims must be rejected.

The Parties shall seek to reach agreement on the impact of the unlawful retroactive
application of the Disputed Measures, on the basis that those measures were otherwise

consistent with the ECT.

Tf the Parties do not, within 3 months of the date of this Decision, reach agreement on the
amount payable in this respect, either of them may request the Tribunal to decide the
outstanding issues in dispute, in accordance with a prompt briefing schedule. If the Parties
do reach agreement on the amount due, they should report this to the Tribunal in order to
enable it to issue an Award incorporating this Decision and dealing with any residual
issues identified, including costs, thereby terminating the proceedings. The Tribunal will

deal with costs issues in that Award.

Mr. Grigera Na6n disagrees with these conclusions, insofar as they hold Spain not
responsible for full compensation for the New Regime. In his view, Spain breached
Article 10.1, first and second sentence, of the ECT, in 2013 by imposing that regime upon
the Claimants’ Wind Farms, which were already well established and had legitimate
expectations as to the maintenance of the Special Regime. A statement of the reasons for

this dissent is attached.

1. _ This dissenting opinion is limited only to findings and conclusions in the Majority Decision
on Jurisdiction, Liability and Directions on Quantum (the “Decision”) starting at the
Decision’s para. 456 regarding the Claimants’ claim based on the fair and equitable
standard (the “FET”) under Article 10.1 of the Energy Charter Treaty (the “ECT”). More
specifically, I dissent with the Decision’s reasons and determinations according to which
the Claimants are only entitled to damage compensation for what the Decision
characterizes as “...the retroactive reduction in the allowed return....”, and not to full
compensation for the life of the Claimants’ facilities, and the basis to establish such
compensation. Therefore, I also disagree with the analysis, conclusions and way forward
on quantum of damages set forth in paras. 612-617 of the Decision.

2. However, to avoid misunderstanding as to the scope of this dissent, I share: a) the
Decision’s conclusion at paras. 483 and 484 that a 25 year-life is appropriate for Wind
Farms; b) the analysis of and conclusions on the protection and security Claimants’ claim
at the Decision’s paras. 528-534; and c) the Decision’s analysis and conclusions regarding
the tax gross-up claim set forth at paras. 618-628 of the Decision. Further, although certain
coincidences in the approach and reasoning in this dissent and in the Decision may be
noticeable, this does not detract from substantial disagreements evidenced in the text and
conclusions that follow. The undersigned believes that only reading together this dissent
and the Decision’s paragraphs covering the FET claim allows to adequately identify such
areas of disagreement even where the Decision does not specify that it is rendered by
majority.

3. A FET analysis requires a balancing exercise between Claimants’ rights under the legal
framework spanning 1996-2012 (the “Special Regime”) and the regime put in place
through legal enactments by the Spanish Government in 2013-2014 (the “New Regime”).

4. — It is common ground between the Parties that the Special Regime could be subject to
regulatory changes. The issue is the balance to be struck between the rights granted to the
Claimants and accompanying expectations of stability, gain and profit through concrete
and specific provisions under the Special Regime and the New Regime regulations
curtailing or eliminating such rights or baffling those expectations. Such balance requires
a weighing of different factors along notions of reasonableness and proportionality. To this
exercise I now turn.

5. One first relevant factor to be accounted for in this exercise is that the Claimants’ rights
under the Special Regime and accompanying expectations of stability, gain and profit
originate (just considering the Special Regime’s concrete legal provisions) in specific rules
of law having mandatory force of their own. Therefore, without denying the importance of
general representations or statements generating investors’ legitimate expectations, the
analysis should be, first and foremost, centered on the imperative legal provisions at the
heart of the Special Regime.

6. Expectations arising out of such Special Regime’s legal rules are necessarily legitimate
among other things because, on the contrary, the very function of rules of law — particularly
in democratic societies - to create areas of predictability and security orienting human
action would be defeated. They are also objective, since they flow from specific rules of
law and not from subjective evaluation. As set forth in the 9REN award !:

“There is no doubt that an enforceable ‘legitimate expectation’ requires a clear and
specific commitment, but in the view of this Tribunal there is no reason in principle why
such a commitment of the requisite clarity and specificity cannot be made in the regulation
itself where (as here) such a commitment is made for the purpose of inducing investment,
which succeeded in attracting the Claimant’s investment and once made resulted in losses
to the Claimant”.

Thus, those questioning the relevance or effects of such expectations have the burden to
prove the facts and legal grounds supporting the reasons to do so.

7. Against this backdrop, the Special Regime’s salient legal traits shall be now considered.

8. The Special Regime had as its point of departure Law 54/1997 which provided for less than
50 MW wind facilities like the Claimants (such Claimants’ facilities hereinafter the “Wind
Farms”) the right to opt for pool (market) price plus premium for the sale of their electricity.
Premium determination? “... will take into account the voltage level of the delivery of
energy to the network, the effective contribution to the improvement of the environment,
the primary energy savings and energy efficiency, the production of economically
justifiable useful heat and the investment costs incurred, in order to achieve reasonable
profitability rates with reference to the cost of the money on capital markets” (the “Law
54 Standard”).

| OREN vy. f Spain (Award), para. 295, RL-0125. In the same vein, the Cube v. Spain (Decision), at para. 388: “The
Tribunal does not consider it necessary that a specific commitment be made to each individual claimant in order for
a legitimate expectation to arise. At least in the case of a highly — regulated industry, and provided that the
representations are sufficiently clear and unequivocal, it is enough that a regulatory regime be established with the
overt aim of attracting investments by holding out to potential investors the prospect that the investments will be
subject to a set of specific regulatory principles that will, as a matter of deliberate policy, be maintained in force for
a finite length of time. Such regimes are plainly intended to create expectations upon which investors will rely; and
to the extent that those expectations are objectively reasonable, they give rise to legitimate expectations when
investments are in fact made in reliance upon them”.

9. | The Wind Farms were built, commissioned and RAIPRE registered under RD 2818/1998
on 22-25 November 2002°. It provided certain guiding and predictable parameters defining
the legal framework that in general terms remained applicable to the Wind Farms until
2013; namely, the Wind Farms could either directly sell electricity to distributors at a fixed
tariff in Spanish pesetas for each kWh, or at the pool (market price) plus a fixed premium
in pesetas also for each kWh. Under this Decree, the premiums were to be revised every
four years considering the evolution of electricity market price, the installations’ demand
coverage and the effect on the management of the Electricity System as a whole. Like
future decrees, it provided for a transitory regime allowing facilities pre-dating this Decree
to stay under the previous regime.

10. Six years later RD 436/2004 was adopted. It maintained the option of fixed tariff (as a
percentage of the TMR or tarifa eléctrica media) and pool price plus premium. Tariffs,
premium, incentives and complements under this Decree became effective in respect of
facilities commencing operations on | January of the second year after the revision of
tariffs under this Decree, i.e., excluding the Wind Farms from the retroactive application
of the Decree (Article 40.2). This is further confirmed by Article 40.3 of the Decree stating
that it “...shall not be effective retroactively on any previous tariffs and premiums”.
Premiums under this Decree were set forth at a Euro price by kWh. As allowed by this
Decree, the Wind Farms chose in 2005 not to remain under the RD 2818/1998 regime until
2007 and to sell electricity under the pool price/premium option pursuant to RD 436/2004,
with the annual option (never elected by the Wind Farms) to shift to the TMR percentage
regime.

11. Years later RD 661/2007 was adopted. It set a Euro price tariff per kWh adjusted to the
consumer price index (CPI) as one option, and as another option, a pool price plus premium
also set at a Euro amount per kWh, adjusted in accordance with CPI, and subject to caps
and floors. Article 44.3 of this Decree provided that it would not affect facilities
commissioned prior to the second following year in which the revision shall have been
performed, thus excluding its retrospective application to the Wind Farms.

12. The Wind Farms opted to stay in the pool price plus premium option under RD 436/2004
until 31 December 2012. After then it was subject to the RD 661/2007 regime with the
possibility to annually choose between the fixed tariff and the pool price plus premium
option under this Decree. RD 661/2007 further provided that at the expiration of a twenty-
year period counted from the beginning of operations of the Wind Farms (i.e., November
2022) the option would come to an end and, without any time limitation, the electricity
would be sold at the fixed tariff price only.

13. Although RDL 6/2009 did refer to the electricity system tariff deficit among its reasons, it
did not affect wind facilities like the Wind Farms since it only set forth more stringent
requirements for new entrants to the Special Regime. Wind facilities like the Wind Farms
were not included in the New Regime enacted under RD 1565/2010 reducing the economic
benefits of PV (photovoltaic) plants.

14. In 2010, Royal Decree 1614 was adopted. Among other things, it provided that premiums
under RD 661/2007 would be reduced by 35% but that such reduction would not apply to
facilities like the Wind Farms that had chosen to stay under the RD 436/2004 regime, which
would remain under the 2010 premium and tariff values (i.e., not the higher 2013 values
that would have applied otherwise) once the transitory application to the Wind Farms of
the RD 436/2004 came to an end. It further provided (Articles 5.2, 5.3) that facilities like
the Wind Farms would not be subject to the reviews of tariffs and premiums upper and
lower limits (all set at kWh prices as of 2010) established in RD 661/2007%.

15. In view of the electric system tariff deficit, Article 1 of RDL 6/2009 of 7 May 2009
modified Law 54/1997 essentially to impose access tolls on Special Regime facilities like
the Wind Farms exclusively to pay for the costs of Special Regime activities assumed to
contribute to the deficit. Later, RDL 14/2010 of 23 December 2010, also aimed at coping
with the tariff deficit, increased the toll burden on Special Regime facilities like the Wind
Farms.

16. Royal Decree Law 1/2012, also prompted by the electricity tariff regime deficit, suppressed
the pool price plus premium remuneration afforded under RDL 1/2012. However, this
measure only applied to new Special Regime entrants, and the Decree emphasized that it
did not retrospectively affect vested rights (including those of the Wind Farms).

17. As from 2013, the New Regime drastically put an end to and in fact erased the Special
Regime by introducing a “new model” for the compensation of renewable energy

producers like the Wind Farms", essentially as follows:

a

It eliminated the price plus premium option (the one elected by the Wind Farms)

b

It changed the tariff adjustment factor, eliminating unprocessed foods and energy
products from the adjustment basket.

c

It afforded no possibility to sell electricity at a fixed tariff option (meaning that
electricity prices are freely fixed by the market).

d

It eliminated the regime of fixed tariffs and premiums for all renewable energy
facilities, new and old, introduced for the first time a remuneration system based on
standard costs per unit of installed power plus standard amounts for operating costs and
set a target rate of return at 300 points above the ten-year average yield of Spanish
Government ten-year bonds.

e

It set the remuneration parameters for standard facilities including standard costs
(without considering the actual costs of each specific facility) as a result of which the
reasonable return is set at 7.398% pre-tax for all facilities like the Wind Farms, subject
to periodical three-year and six-year reviews. The first such six-year period lapses on

31 December 2019 counted as from the coming into effect of RDL 9/2013 of 12 July
2013)°. After the facilities’ regulatory period lapses (20 years after the beginning of
their operation in the case of the Wind Farms), the facilities would not receive any price
other than the pool (market) price.

f) Facilities deemed to have reached such reasonable return level could not benefit from
a specific compensation paid by the State covering investment costs and operating costs
that cannot be recouped through sales in the electricity market, such costs
corresponding to a type or standard facility defined in the IET Order based on standard
revenue obtainable from sales in the electricity market, standard costs necessary for
the operation of the facility and the standard value of the original investment for an
enterprise deemed efficient and well managed during its useful life.”

Until the enactment of the New Regime, unlike the situation of other renewables, such as
the photovoltaic facilities, the measures taken by the Spanish Government were aimed at
preserving the Special Regime for wind facilities like the Wind Farms.

This is especially true in connection with the Wind Farms, not only because of the specific
rights vested in them under the Special Regime, but also because of the successive elections
they made to remain under RD 436/2004 by exercising the option to choose between
regulated tariff and pool price under such Decree and remain under the RD 661/2007 on
renewable energy and cogeneration once the RD 436/2004 would cease to apply to them.

In particular, the Official Press Release of 25 May 2007 of the Ministry of Industry,
Tourism and Commerce of the Kingdom of Spain in connection with RD 661/2007
assigned priority to profitability and stability of the incentives under the Special Regime
and emphasized both its non-retroactive character and its non-application to facilities like
the Wind Farms in operation by 1 January 2008.

Among other things, this press release expressed that RD 661/2007 was aimed at
establishing “....a stable system of incentives guaranteeing an attractive return for the
activity of energy production under the special regime”, as part “...of the energy policy
commitment to promote the use in our country of clean, autochthonous and efficient
sources of energy...”. It also expressed that the Decree was a manifestation of the Spanish
Government’s commitment to seek in the new regulation “...stability in time (...) allowing
business owners to plan in the medium and long term, as well as a sufficient and reasonable
return which, like the stability, makes the investment and engagement in this activity
attractive”. It also stated that “Any revisions of tariffs to be carried out in the future shall
not affect the facilities already in operation. This guarantee provides legal certainty for
the producer, providing stability for the sector and promoting its development ®.

22. Statements in this press release are consistent with the wording precluding the retrospective
application of its provisions set forth in Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007, constitute specific
representations that future tariff revisions would have no retroactive effect and would not
affect facilities already in operation, although the stability afforded was not unlimited in
time °.

23. In other words, in part by exercising rights contemplated under the Special Regime
allowing them to preserve the pool price plus premium option, in part because of the very
legal provisions of the Special Regime applying to them and expressions attributable to the
Respondent in connection with RD 661/2007, it is fair to say that the Wind Farms could
unequivocally rely on the Special Regime’s stability specifically designed to attract their
long-term investment in the Spanish renewable energy sector.

24. This contrasts with the remuneration criteria introduced by the New Regime because:

a) as summarized in the Eiser award!®: The new regime pays no regard to actual costs
(including loan servicing) or actual efficiencies of specific existing [plants](...)
Moreover, within limits intended to assure threshold amounts of production,
remuneration no longer is based on the amount of electricity generated. Instead,
existing plants’ remuneration is based on their generating capacity and regulators’
estimates of the hypothetical capital and operating costs, per unit of generating
capacity, of a hypothetical standard installation of the type concerned. The regulatory
regime also sets the regulatory life of a plant''. Once set, neither the regulatory life
nor the prescribed “initial value of the investment” can be changed”;

b

the investors in the Wind Farms were legitimately relying on a remuneration
mechanism based on the production of electricity quantities at an hourly price for kWh
and not on a remuneration regime exclusively depending on a relationship between
standardized operative costs and cash inflows or efficient investment criteria, which,
further, are all disconnected from the actual operation costs and investment data of the
Wind Farms. Reasonable return references in different provisions of the Special
Regime were merely benchmarks without setting forth maximum return limits on
investments. Thus, under the Special Regime, the more electricity produced the more
remuneration (and eventually a higher return for the investors) was obtainable, i.e.,
there was an incentive to produce more electricity to feed the market reducing the need
to inject in the grid electricity from less environmental friendly sources’? (it should be
noted that the New Regime does not put emphasis on environmental concerns);

c

the New Regime is perverse not only because the rigid standardized criteria it imposes
ex post renders some wind facilities (like the Wind Farms) unprofitable and others
profitable without regard to the actual economic characteristics of each facility in terms,
inter alia, of their real investment and operating costs, but also because it does not

allow the Claimants to predict future costs and investment standards — as well as return
rates for the following years - since they depend on variables unilaterally and
discretionarily determined by the Respondent, and in any case detached from the
realities of the Claimants’ investments and operations;

d

wind facilities like the Wind Farms are unable to adapt ex post to existing investment
and operational characteristics to fit under the New Regime’s standardized parameters
resulting in the imposition of a maximum pre-tax return, which also did not account for
the differentiated tax regime wind facilities may be subject to depending on their
location in different administrative and tax territorial divisions of the Spanish Kingdom
'3, and are left as their only option to actually attain the pre-set, pre-tax 7.398% return
by reducing their costs even if their reduction might not be realistically attainable or
technically convenient, or even if such reductions may lead to economic or technical
demise of the facility;

e

without such predictability levels, project finance, allowing higher leverage levels that
result in better value for consumers (since this form of financing is less expensive than
other forms of financing, including owners’ equity infusions) would not be possible!*.

f) both Decrees 6/2009 and 14/2010 mentioned at para. 15 above, as well as the freezing
at 2010 values of incentives pursuant to Royal Decree 1614 described in para. 14 above,
constituted a reassurance to investors in wind facilities like the Claimants’ that they
had already contributed their fair share to address the tariff deficit within the general
context of the existing Special Regime proportionately to their benefits under the
Special Regime, and therefore, that no further sacrifices would be requested from them
to pay for a deficit that, after all, there is no evidence that at least the Wind Farms
originated or contributed to in any substantial way.

25. The record further shows that:

a) the tariff deficit addressed by the New Regime originated in 2000,'> well before the
enactment of the decrees of 2004 and 2007 constituting the core of the rights and
expectations on which the Claimants’ claims are based. The Spanish Government,
certainly aware of the deficit, chose however to further burden it through the
introduction of the Special Regime in order to attract, promote and benefit from
investments in renewable energy technologies. If the balance between such burden and
the tariff system was miscalculated by the Spanish Government or the ensuing
imbalance not early cauterized, it has of course the right and the obligation to rebalance
the system, but not at the cost of sacrificing rights and expectations of investors like
the Claimants, which are protected by the ECT.

b) It is undisputed that since 2001 the Wind Farms were financed by resorting to project
finance.'® There is no indication under the Special Regime or related evidence that
project finance or other forms of financing should be excluded from the cost,
remuneration and profit calculation of investors investing in wind facilities like the
Wind Farms. In fact, both the 2000-2010 Renewable Promotion Plan approved by the
Spanish Council of Ministers on 30 December 1999!” and the 2005-2010 Renewable
Promotion Plan approved by the Spanish Council of Ministers of 26 August 2005!®
referred to project finance as a normal means to finance projects like the Wind Farms
and none of them excluded the consideration of financial costs under these facilities
from the Project costs to be taken into account in the Claimants’ profit or return
estimates and associated expectations under the Special Regime in their decision
making process regarding investing in the Spanish wind power sector.'? As the NextEra
arbitral tribunal found:?°

“The question before the Tribunal is not how a regulated activity should determine
what constitutes a reasonable return, but what loss the Claimants suffered. On
undertaking an investment an investor would reasonably expect that the returns
from the investment would cover all the costs of making that investment. The
examples given by Claimants where regulatory regimes do include financing costs
in determining a reasonable rate of return reinforce the reasonableness of ti
expectation. No rational investor would sink money into a project that did not offer
a return that would cover its costs. And, the financing of projects of this size and
duration inevitably involves a regime with third party financing ”.

 

c

Therefore, these financing costs were legitimately considered by the investors in the
Wind Farms when estimating the Project’s cash flows under the Special Regime. The
mere fact that the Project cash flows exceeded the operating costs”! does not detract
from the fact that the investors’ legitimate expectations in the Wind Farms included
obtaining cash flows through electricity sales permitting them to meet their obligations
with the lenders to avoid acceleration of the loans and the insolvency of the Wind Farms

!° The Respondent refers to a Memoria Econémica underlying the proposal of RD 436/2004 which in its page 5 states
that only financing of the Projects under this Decree with investors’ own funds is covered, and that having recourse
to external finance is a decision under the responsibility of the investors. However, the record does not permit to
conclude whether this document went beyond being a mere proposal or not, and its recommendations may not be
traced to actual provisions in the Decree. There is no reason to give to this isolated document more weight than the
2000-2010 and 2005-2010 plans mentioned above, expressly including project finance among the financial resources
for the Special Regime. Furthermore: a) project finance was already resorted to finance the Wind Farms’ activities in
2001 (CWS-ES, paras. 21, 26 at pp. 5-7), i-e., well before RD 436/2004, which could not have been foreseen by the
investors in the Wind Farms in 2001 even assuming that such RD excluded financing costs from the investments in
the Wind Farms, which it did not; b) the 2006 financing and any later financings were refinancing of the original
2001 financing; and c) the 2005-2010 Plan, which refers to RD 436/2004 and came after this Decree maintains project
finance as part of the allowed financing and also provides that the wind facilities like the Wind Farms would rely that
80% of the investment would be sourced from external financing.

inevitably ensuing — as unrebutted evidence shows” -- from the New Regime, and this

despite the refinancing of the project finance debt in 2006. It is also unrebutted that the
unprecedented situation created by the New Regime resulted in a failure to meet the
debt coverage ratio under the project financing structure leading to the acceleration of
the loans and possibly triggering the insolvency of the Wind Farms,” which was only
averted after a renegotiation of the project finance debt bringing about, among other
negative consequences, that the Claimants — under the current New Regime scenario —
will not receive any dividend from the Wind Farms until 2024.

 

26. Insum:

a) the Claimants could not anticipate when investing in the Wind Farms that they would
be imposed a model which redefined ex post facto whether the Wind Farms were and
are efficiently operated and well-managed and the economic benefits derived from
them;7+

b

the radical change in the model brought about by the New Regime was not limited to
suppressing the pool price plus premium mechanisms under the Special Regime, since
it also radically eliminated the investment, remuneration and cost criteria on which
investors under the Special Regime relied upon for calculating economic burdens and
profits and set a limit on investors’ returns;

¢

the New Regime drastically changed the remuneration criteria and cost and investment
structure existing under the Special Regime, both for the past and for the future, in ways
and on the basis of criteria that were totally unpredictable for the Claimants;

d

although Special Regime regulations changed across time, such changes did not
constitute a radical innovation in the then applicable legal framework or a Copernican
modification going to the roots of the Special Regime, and could not be deemed to have
been the harbinger of the radical new model introduced through the New Regime as far
as the Wind Farms are concerned.

27. The following considerations are apposite for scenarios like the ones depicted above:

2 Ibidem, paras. 38-42, at p. 10.
?3As it was clearly set forth in the letter of 8 October 2014 to the Wind Farms from UNI Credit Corporate and Investing
Banking, the agent bank representing the project finance creditors C-0270:

“In particular, the approval of the New Regulations and the impact that, among other factors, they could
have on the Project, are circumstances that, in the reasonable opinion of the Banks, have a clear and direct
negative effect on the cash flows of the Project and, therefore, on its viability. In this regard, the Banks are
of the reasonable understanding that the aforesaid circumstances could become a Material Adverse Effect
as they could substantially impair, among others, the financial solvency of the Borrowers and the Guarantors
considered collectively as well as the viability of the Project. These circumstances are an event of default as
provided in clause 16.1 h) of the Loan Agreements”.

4 TET Order, at 46434, C-0216.

a) “...Indeed, an investor has the legitimate expectation that, when the State modifies the
regulation under which the investor made the investment, it will not do so unreasonably,
contrary to the public interest, or in a disproportionate manner (...)The Arbitration
Tribunal considers that the proportionality requirement is fulfilled as long as the
modifications are not random or unnecessary, and that they do not suddenly and
unexpectedly eliminate the essential features of the regulatory framework in place”.

b) “Taking account of the context and of the ECT’s object and purpose, the Tribunal
concludes that Article 10(1)’s obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment necessarily
embraces an obligation to provide fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of
the legal regime relied upon by investors in making long-term investments. This does not
mean that regulatory regimes cannot evolve. Surely they can... ‘[T]he legitimate
expectations of any investor [...] [have] to include the real possibility of reasonable
changes and amendments in the legal framework, made by the competent authorities within
the limits of the powers conferred on them by the law.’ However, the Article 10(1)
obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment means that regulatory regimes cannot be
radically altered as applied to existing investments in ways that deprive investors who
invested in reliance on those regimes of their investment’s value.”?®

28. Circumstances described in paragraphs 17-26 above, examined against the backdrop of the
above considerations, lead to concluding that the New Regime measures imposed a
disproportionate, unreasonable and unexpected economic burden on the Claimants which
suppressed the legal and economic substance of the regulatory framework they relied upon
when investing, and thus defeated their legitimate expectations.

29. There is no reason to depart from these findings and conclusions because of the alleged
violation by the Wind Farms of the European State Aid Provisions (the “State Aid”)
invoked by the Respondent on the basis of the European Commission (the “EC”) decision
SA.40348 (2015/NN) of 10 November 2017 (the “EC Decision”) issued in response to a
notification by the Respondent of 22 December 2014, the purpose of which was to validate
the New Regime under the State Aid regime.

30. The Respondent refers particularly to Sections 3.5.2. and 3.5.3 of the EC Decision in which
the EC, in statements that can only be considered obiter dicta given the fact that the
Respondent’s consultation only concerned the compatibility of the New Regime with the
State Aid (and not the Special Regime), asserts: (i) that State Aid to investors by a Member
State without respecting the notification and stand-still obligation under Article 108.3 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”) does not generate
legitimate expectations; and (ii) the lack of jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals to decide
investment disputes in intra-European cases (an allegation that has been unanimously
rejected in this arbitration).

The EC Decision — addressed to the Kingdom of Spain and not to the Claimants or the
Wind Farms — raises for the first time the issue of investors’ legitimate expectations from
an European law perspective specifically in connection with the Special Regime. In itself
— because of its date — the EC Decision could not have been taken into account when the
Claimants invested. The same should be said, because of their dates, of the European Court
of Justice 19 December 2013 decision Association Vent de Colére! and the order of the
same Court in the Elcogas SA matter of 2014. As far as the timing of the EC Decision and
these European Court decision and order is concerned, they cannot be invoked to challenge
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations when investing in the Wind Farms.

The issue is then whether the investors, prior to investing within the framework of the
Special Regime, failed to properly discharge their due diligence obligations as a diligent
businessman should do.?’

It is undisputed that the Respondent failed to notify the Special Regime to the EC or comply
with the standstill obligation set forth in Article 108.3 of the TFEU. On the other hand, the
Respondent could not have been unaware, or had the duty to be aware, of any substantive
violation of European law by the Special Regime. The essential failure to comply with
European law or the hypothetical unlawfulness of the Special Regime is first and foremost
imputable to the Respondent, which is indeed alleging, for the first time in this arbitration,
its own fault in order to shirk its obligations and responsibilities under the EC Treaty FET
standards, in violation of the principle nemo turpitudem suam allegarem potest.

The conduct of the Respondent is even more reprehensible if one considers that it relied
for a period spanning 1997-2013 on the Special Regime to attract renewable energy
investments and gave assurances as to the benefits of the Special Regime, at least in
connection with RD 661/2007.

The legitimate expectations of the Claimants and their reliance on the representations
arising out of the Special Regime “....do not depend on there being evidence of any
particular form or scale of legal due diligence by external legal advisors..”?* This is true
also when the alleged incompatibility of the Special Regime with the State Aid system not
captured in the due diligence carried out by the investor prior to investing is invoked to
deny the investor’s rights under the ECT in a scenario in which the investor is confronted
with a drastic suppression of the very legal regime enticing its investment which could not
be reasonably anticipated by the due diligence exercise. Indeed, investing is not a caveat
emptor exercise like buying goods under a sales contract and requires a cooperative attitude
by States among themselves and with the addressees of the ECT protective provisions as
part and parcel of the implementation of policies aimed at attracting foreign investment.
This is illustrated by the ECT text itself:

complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and
principles of the Charter.

Raising in arbitration as a lack of due diligence on the side of the investor its not having
detected that the failure to notify the Special Regime was an infringement of European Law
or its failing to realize the substantial incompatibility of the Special Regime with the State
Aid system, with the ultimate consequence of invalidating the very Special Regime the
Respondent was relying upon to attract millions of Euro investments to its renewable
energy sector, is inimical to the cooperation purposes of the ECT. In fact, it is an attempt
by the Respondent to capitalize on its own failure to observe obligations under European
law in violation of the principle of good faith under international law, including as
comprised by the ECT FET standard.

This conduct is even more blatantly in violation of the ECT in view of the relevant parts of
its Article 10.1:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty,
encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for
Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such
conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.

Even admitting that the encouragement of stable, equitable and transparent conditions for
foreign investors and investments in the energy sector is part already of FET protection,
under the ECT (and not an autonomous standard), the fact that ECT, Article 10.1, lays
special emphasis on these objectives cannot be mere happenstance and can only be
interpreted as meaning that among the protective standards covered by FET, the EC
Member States assigned particular importance to ensuring stable, favorable and transparent
conditions for foreign investment. The Respondent infringed its transparency and stability
commitments by: a) failing to notify the Special Regime pursuant to its obligations under
European law; b) failing to alert prospective investors — like the Claimants — as to potential
risks of the very Special Regime the Respondent was seeking to draw benefit from; and c)
only raising this defense in arbitration.

 

Further (as the Decision points out) it is undisputed that: a) The EC was well informed
about the Special Regime, never raised any issues regarding its lawfulness under European
law, and even extolled its benefits although the Kingdom of Spain had not notified the
Special Regime to the EC in compliance with European Law; b) there is no specific EC
decision rendering the Special Regime unlawful; c) there is no EC right of or duty on the
Kingdom of Spain to procure the reimbursement of the Special Regime payments made to
the Claimants or anybody else.

This is the situation the Claimants were confronted with when investing and the situation
contemplated by the Respondent when the investments were made. Whatever the realities
of the European legal system might be or have been, it can only be concluded, from the
perspective of the FET protection afforded to the Claimants under the ECT, that if the

investors invested and the Kingdom of Spain accepted the application of the Special
Regime to such investments during a period spanning at least ten years, both were
persuaded that the Special Regime was lawful under Spanish and European law, and
shared legitimate expectations that such would be the case.

Indisputably, State Aid rules are part of Spanish law. A higher level of due diligence
regarding the situation of Spanish law cannot be required from the foreign investor than
the one incumbent on the Respondent in enforcing European law and its own law
incorporating State Aid provisions. The same can be said of the EC during the existence of
the Special Regime under which millions of Euros were infused into the Spanish
renewables sector, without however the EC raising red flags about the incompatibility of
the Special Regime with European law or supposedly excessive investor returns.

A different conclusion would mean that the Kingdom of Spain was acting in bad faith by
actually blowing hot and cold at the same time, i.e., resorting to the Special Regime to
attract foreign investment to the renewable energy sector and in parallel not complying
with European law as regards the Special Regime or knowing that the Special Regime did
not comply with European law. It would also imply that during the long years in which the
Special Regime was in place, the EC failed in its duties to monitor and oversee the Special
Regime in light of European law protecting fair competition in the European markets. From
the perspective of the ECT and international law, such facts and circumstances lead to
concluding that the expectations of the Claimants arising out of the Special Regime are not
illegitimate and, therefore, that are entitled to protection under the ECT FET standard.

On the basis of the above reasons and findings, it is to be concluded that the Respondent
has violated the FET standard under the ECT and that the Claimants are entitled to full
compensation for past and future damages resulting to the Claimants from the New
Regime.

A. Quantum Issues

44.

4S.

46.

The Parties’ quantum experts have adopted very different approaches.

KPGM quantifies the Special Regime incentives the Claimants have been deprived of
during the useful life of the Wind Farms. Depending on the date the calculation is made,
and considering that the relevant measure came into effect on 1 January 2013, KPGM
proceeds as follows: a) at the date of calculation, it calculates the difference between free
cash flows to the Claimants under the New Regime and free cash flows to the Claimants
under the Special Regime between | January 2013 and the date of calculation; and b) after
the date of calculation, it calculates the moneys the Claimants should receive in the future
in accordance with the Special Regime, discounted to present value to the date of
calculation pursuant to a DCF methodology .

Econ One’s analysis, on the contrary, is premised on a maximum reasonable return
approach in line with the New Regime provisions and the Law 54/1997 standard.

47. However, the Special Regime, which did not impose maximum limitations on the investors
‘returns”’, set forth a premium or tariff regime necessarily compatible with the Law 54
Standard, because on the contrary an oxymoron would ensue: the Special Regime would
be incompatible and compatible at the same time with such Standard. Consequently, the
Claimants legitimately relied on the Special Regime as expressing in concrete legal norms
the Law 54 Standard. On the other hand, there is nothing in the wording of the Special
Regime indicating that the open-ended (and opaque) text of the Law 54 Standard would
lead to — and much less justify- the replacement of the Special Regime with an utterly
different model unilaterally destroying the substance of the Claimants’ rights under the
Special Regime.

48. As found by the arbitral tribunal in Novenergia II:°

As regards statements in relation to ‘economic sustainability’ and ‘reasonable rate
of return’ the Tribunal finds the Respondent's arguments unconvincing, since these
principles were still generally vague and insufficiently defined at the time of the
Claimant's investment. Precise content was given to these principles through the
introduction of Law 15/2012 and RDL 9/2013, which were enacted long after the
Claimant had already made its investment. Accordingly, they cannot be considered
apposite for the assessment of the reasonability of the Claimant's expectations at
the time of the investment, as the Respondent suggests (...) The above conclusion
deals with the majority of the Respondent's statement’s.

 

49. It is then too much to rub to the open-textured and undefined terms of the Law 54 standard
and what purports to be a particularization of such standards in the New Regime, the
imposition on the Wind Farms, not only retroactively, but also for the future, of an entirely
new and unpredictable cost, investment and remuneration model.

50. Therefore, the FET violation does not directly depend on the deprivation of the Claimants’
return, whatever that return might be: rather, it is the direct consequence of the suppression
of the Special Regime the Claimants relied upon when investing. Thus, it is such
suppression, rather than the suppression of real or hypothetical returns, which must be
compensated. In the words of the Eiser tribunal (coincidental with the NextEra holding
when rejecting the reasonable return calculations of both parties’ experts):

Without entering into the details of Claimants’ experts’ calculation of this alternate
claim, and of Respondent's rebuttal to it, the Tribunal finds the legal theory
underlying it unpersuasive. ECT Article 10(1) does not entitle Claimants to a
‘reasonable return’ at any given level, but to fair and equitable treatment '

And as it was held by the Cube tribunal”:

The Tribunal does not accept that the cost-based approach, calculating a
reasonable rate of return on the amount initially invested, is appropriate in the
present context. The 2013-2014 change of the regulatory regime so as to introduce
the concept of a reasonable rate of return as a cap on support under the regulatory
regime, in place of the fixed tariffs and premiums for which the Special Regime had
provided, is one of the measures at the very heart of the complaint in this case; and
the Tribunal has found that this amendment constituted such a fundamental change
in the economic basis on which the investments were made — a ‘mid-stream switch
in the regulatory paradigm’ — as to amount to a defeat of the Claimants’ legitimate
expectations in breach of the FET standard in Article 10 ECT.

For these reasons, the KPGM methodology for calculating damages resulting from the
deprivation of the Special Regime appropriately corresponds to the findings on the merits
set forth above.

However, KPGM’s calculations should be adjusted as follows:

a

b

The appropriate date to be considered as the New Regime implementation date for
calculation purposes should be the date of the IET Order setting forth the New Regime
in full and in its final form, i.e., 16 June 2014 rather than 1 January 2013; and

Using a DCF methodology to calculate future damages for the useful life of the Wind
Farms is justified for the 25-year period counted from 25 November 2002 through 25
November 2027. Calculating future damages through the end of the useful life of the
Wind Farms beyond this date seems too speculative given the variables taken into
account to such effect.** Therefore, also in accordance with reasonableness and
proportionality notions, the calculation of future damages and application of the DCF
methodology should not go beyond 25 November 2027.

As calculated by KPGM as of 6 November 2017 (pre-award interest included), the

compensation amount equals € 65,243,81

5*4 This sum should be adjusted to an updated

calculation date taking into account the criteria set forth in paragraph 53 and also by
excluding compensation for the imposition of the 7% tax and without computing the tax
gross-up, both denied by the Arbitral Tribunal.
