INTRODUCTION

This is an ad hoc arbitration brought under the Agreement between the Federal
Republic of Germany and the Republic of India for the Promotion and Protection
of Investments of 10 July 1995 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”),’ pursuant to the 1976
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL”) Arbitration
Rules (the “UNCITRAL Rules’).

THE PARTIES
The Claimant

The Claimant is Deutsche Telekom AG (the “Claimant” or “DT”), a company
incorporated under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.

The Claimant was represented in the quantum phase of this arbitration by Ms.
Sylvia Noury, Mr. William Thomas, Mr. Michael Kotrly, Ms. Ella Davies, Ms. Annie
Pan, and Ms. Leonie Beyrle of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, and Mr.
Aman Ahluwalia.

The Respondent
The Respondent is the Republic of India (the “Respondent” or “India”).

The Respondent was represented in the quantum phase of this arbitration by
Messrs. George Kahale Ill, Benard V. Preziosi, Simon Batifort, Fernando Tupa,
and Fuad Zarbiyev of Curtis Mallet-Prevost Colt & Mosle LLP.

THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

The Arbitral Tribunal is composed of Mr. Daniel M. Price, appointed by the
Claimant; Prof. Brigitte Stern, appointed by the Respondent; and Prof. Gabrielle
Kaufmann-Kohler, appointed by the Parties upon proposal of the ICSID Secretary

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 9 of 125

The Tribunal appointed Dr. Michele Potesta as Secretary of the Tribunal, with the
consent of the Parties.?

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE ON QUANTUM

This dispute arises out of India’s annulment of the agreement for the lease of S-
band electromagnetic spectrum on two satellites concluded on 28 January 2005
(the “Agreement” or “Devas Agreement”)* between DT’s indirect subsidiary
Devas Multimedia Private Limited (“Devas”)> and the Indian state-owned
company Antrix Corporation Limited (“Antrix”). The Agreement inter alia
contemplated offering mobile multimedia and broadband data services to the
Indian market via a hybrid satellite-terrestrial communications platform (the
“Devas System’).®

On 13 December 2017, the Tribunal issued an Interim Award (the “Interim
Award”) in which it decided that:

“a. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute involving the
Claimant and the Respondent;

b. The Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment
standard provided in Article 3(2) of the BIT;

c. The Tribunal will take the necessary steps for the continuation of

the proceedings toward the quantum phase.””
The issue now before this Tribunal is what compensation, if any, should be
awarded to DT for India’s breach of the Treaty.

In sum, the Claimant submits that the annulment of the Devas Agreement by
India “destroyed the entire value of Devas’s business (which rested on the

See Interim Award, para. 12.

Agreement for the Lease of Space Segment Capacity on ISRO/Antrix SB and Spacecraft
by Devas Multimedia Pvt Ltd, 28 January 2005, Exh. C-006.

DT’s wholly-owned subsidiary, DT Asia (Singaporean company) owns 19.62% of Devas’s
paid up share capital. See Interim Award, paras. 66-70.

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 10 of 125

valuable spectrum rights it held under the Agreement) in a single stroke”, with the
result that DT’s investment in Devas is now worthless.®

For the Claimant, damages should be quantified so as to put DT in the position
in which it would be but for the annulment of the Devas Agreement. The
quantification of damages should be based on the fair market value (the “FMV”)
of DT’s investment in Devas.° According to the Claimant, the most appropriate
valuation method is the Discounted Cash Flow (the “DCF”) method as that is the
approach a hypothetical willing buyer would have taken in valuing DT’s stake in
Devas.'° On the basis of a DCF valuation, DT seeks damages in the sum of
USD 270 million."' In the alternative, the Claimant seeks a valuation according to
what it calls the “Investment Plus” method. On that basis, the Claimant contends
that DT’s investment in Devas amounts to between USD 207 to USD 284
million."? The Claimant disputes the Respondent's view that any damages should
be limited to sunk costs contending that it represents an inappropriate valuation
method in this case, among other reasons, because it is not a measure of the
FMV of DT’s investment. In addition to the principal amount, DT seeks interest
and costs.

The Respondent submits that DT should not be awarded any damages because
it has failed to establish a causal link between the breach of the Treaty and its
alleged loss, and it should not be entitled to compensation for rights it never had.'$
More specifically, the Respondent alleges that, but for the annulment of the
Agreement, (i) Devas would not have obtained the necessary licenses to enable
it to roll out its proposed business, and (ii) reasonable spectrum charges would
have been applied.'4

For the Respondent, the DCF method is wholly inappropriate in this case as it
erroneously assumes that Devas had an acquired right to engage in the Devas

project and had a track record of profitability." In any event, the application of the
DCF method based on reasonable assumptions shows that Devas had no
value.'® For the Respondent, the alternative “Investment Plus” method is equally
unsuitable because it is speculative and based on inaccurate premises.'7 While
the Respondent's primary position is that no damages should be awarded, if the
Tribunal finds against it on that point, India argues that damages should be limited
to sunk costs, which it claims are no more than USD 24.1 million.'® India opposes
the interest and costs claims and requests that costs be assessed against the
Claimant.'®

THE PARTIES’ PRAYERS FOR RELIEF
In its Reply, the Claimant requested the following relief:

“On the basis of the foregoing, without limitation and expressly reserving its
right to supplement this request for relief, DT respectfully requests that the
Tribunal:

(a) ORDER India to pay DT compensation in an amount of US$270 million for
its breaches of the Treaty or such other sum as the Tribunal determines will
ensure full reparation;

(b) ORDER India to pay pre-award interest on (a) above calculated at the rate
of LIBOR plus 4% compounded annually from the Valuation Date until the date
of the Tribunal’s award, or at such other rate and compounding period as the
Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation;

(c) ORDER India to pay post-award interest on the same basis as pre-award
interest accruing from the date of the award until payment is made in full;

(d) DECLARE that:

(i) the award of damages and interest in (a), (b) and (c) be made net of all
Indian taxes; and

(ii) India may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award of
damages and interest in (a), (b) and (c);

(e) ORDER India to indemnify DT:

(i) for any taxes India assesses on the award of damages and interest in
(a), (b) and (c); and

(ii) in respect of any double taxation liability that would arise in Germany or
elsewhere that would not have arisen but for India’s adverse measures;

(f) AWARD such further or other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate;
and

(g) ORDER India to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration,
including DT’s legal (external and internal) and expert costs, fees, and
expenses, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of
any appointing or administering authority, the fees and expenses of any
experts appointed by the Tribunal and the costs and expenses of any hearings
(including the costs of DT’s witnesses in preparing for and/or attending such
hearings), plus interest, pursuant to the discretion granted under Article
9(2)(b)(vii) of the Treaty and Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules.”?°

In its C-PHB1, the Claimant requested the following relief:

“The Claimant relies on its Request for Relief as set out in its Reply on
Quantum, subject to amending paragraph (b) such that interest is calculated
at the rate of LIBOR (or any other comparable rate in case LIBOR should be
discontinued in the future) plus 4% in line with the suggestion in paragraph
228 above.”*!

The Respondent has requested the following relief:

“For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal should reject Claimant's
damage claim in its entirety and assess the costs of this case against
Claimant.”

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

The procedural history leading up to the Interim Award has been summarized in
that decision, to which the Tribunal refers.

On 10 January 2018, the Claimant asked to correct the list of counsel appearing
in the Interim Award. The Respondent raised no objections. On 5 February 2018,
the Tribunal adopted the Corrections to the Interim Award.

On 29 January 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had filed a
request before the Swiss Federal Tribunal to set aside the Interim Award and stay

the present proceedings. On 31 January 2018, the Claimant objected to the stay
of this arbitration.

On 22 February 2018, after receiving the Parties’ proposals, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 6 setting out the procedural calendar for the quantum
phase. On 16 March 2018, following the Parties’ disagreement on the venue of
the hearing on quantum, the Tribunal determined that the hearing would be held
in Paris, as provided in the Terms of Appointment.24

On 4 May 2018, the Claimant filed its Memorial on Quantum (“Memorial”).
On 21 May 2018, the Respondent asked the Tribunal and the Claimant whether:

i. the so-called “DT quantum papers” (i.e. DT’s Memorial on Quantum,
supporting witness statements, expert report and documentary evidence)
may be used in the Mauritius BIT Arbitration;

ii. the evidence presented in the Mauritius BIT Arbitration may be used in
the present proceedings; and

iii. | the Respondent may call as a witness in either case any witness who had
submitted a witness statement on behalf of either the Mauritius claimants
or DT in the quantum phase.

On 27 May 2018, the Respondent brought to the Tribunal’s attention a procedural
order issued by the Mauritius BIT Arbitration tribunal, whereby that tribunal invited
Mr. Scheuermann, one of the Claimant's witnesses in this arbitration, to appear
to testify at the hearing in that arbitration. Moreover, the Mauritius BIT Arbitration
tribunal also allowed the Respondent to submit the DT quantum papers into
evidence in the Mauritius BIT Arbitration and requested that such evidence be
produced by 1 June 2018, calling the Respondent to use its best efforts to make
the evidence available, including by applying to this Tribunal if necessary.

On 29 May 2018, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's requests.

Having reviewed the Parties’ positions, on 30 May 2018, the Tribunal authorized
the introduction of the DT quantum papers into the Mauritius BIT Arbitration,
subject to confidentiality being preserved in relation to those documents.

On 7 September 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Quantum
(the “Counter-Memorial’).

On 27 September 2018, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to order the Respondent
not to submit the evidence obtained through the Mauritius BIT Arbitration in the
present arbitration for reasons of confidentiality. On 23 October 2018, after having
received the Respondent's comments, the Tribunal decided that the Respondent
could rely on relevant information from the quantum record of the Mauritius BIT
Arbitration, provided that the Claimant could address that information in its

forthcoming written and oral submissions.
On 7 December 2018, the Claimant filed its Reply on Quantum (“Reply”).

On 11 December 2018, the Tribunal was informed that the Swiss Federal Tribunal
had denied the application to set aside the Interim Award.

On 11 March 2019, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Quantum (‘“Rejoinder’).

On 1 April 2019, the Tribunal and the Parties held a telephone conference to
discuss the outstanding issues pertaining to the organization of the hearing on
quantum. On 8 April 2019, the Tribunal adopted Procedural Order No. 7 on the
Organization of the Hearing on Quantum, incorporating the Parties’ comments on
the draft order which had been previously circulated by the Tribunal and having
due regard to the discussions during the pre-hearing telephone conference.

The hearing on quantum took place from 29 April to 3 May 2019 (“Hearing”) at
the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris. The following people attended the Hearing.

On 7 May 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 on post-hearing
matters (“PO8”).

On 15 May 2019, following the Respondent’s request and the Claimant having
raised no objection, the Tribunal allowed the Respondent to produce the
testimony of Mr. Harman in the Mauritius BIT Arbitration.

On 10 June 2019, the court reporter delivered the final transcript of the Hearing
(‘Transcript’), which included the revisions proposed by the Parties.

On 19 June 2019, the Respondent sent a letter addressing certain questions
raised by Prof. Stern at the end of the Hearing. Shortly thereafter, the Claimant
objected to the Respondent's letter on the basis that it was contrary to the
procedure set out in PO8. The Claimant suggested that the Respondent
incorporate the letter and evidence attached thereto in its first post-hearing brief
on quantum and the Claimant provide its comments in its second post hearing
brief. The Respondent agreed to the Claimant’s proposal.

On 28 June 2019, the Parties filed their PHBs on Quantum (i.e. the Claimant's
first post hearing brief (“C-PHB1”) and the Respondent's first post hearing brief
(“R-PHB1”)).

On 2 August 2019, the Parties filed their second PHBs on Quantum (i.e. the
Claimant’s second post hearing brief (“C-PHB2”) and Respondent's second post
hearing brief (“R-PHB2”)).

On 30 August 2019, the Parties filed their submissions on costs (“C-CS2” and “R-

On 5 November 2019, the Tribunal provided a progress report to the Parties.

On 9 March 2020, the Respondent provided “an update regarding the
confirmation proceedings of the award rendered in the case Devas Multimedia
Private Limited v. Antrix Corporation Limited, |CC Case No. 18051/CYK (the “ICC
Award”), in France”.

On 12 March 2020, the Tribunal invited the Claimant's comments, if any, on the
Respondent's letter of 9 March 2020, by 19 March 2020. No comments were
received by the time limit set by the Tribunal.

On 27 March 2020, the Tribunal provided another progress report to the Parties,
indicating that it would issue the award in May.

On 18 May 2020, in response to a question from the Tribunal, both Parties
requested a 3-day notice of the issuance of the award and confirmed the details
of their counsel.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND RELEVANT TO QUANTUM

known as GSAT-6) and PS-2 (also known as GSAT-6A) to be manufactured and
launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (“ISRO”). The total amount

of S-band capacity leased to Devas was 70 MHz, out of which 60 MHz were of

Broadcast Satellite Services spectrum and the remaining 10 MHz were of Mobile

Satellite Services spectrum.?”

The Agreement included the following provisions allocating the burden of

obtaining regulatory approvals:

Pursuant to Article 3(c), Antrix was “responsible for obtaining all
necessary Governmental and Regulatory Approvals relating to orbital slot
and frequency clearances, and funding for the satellite to facilitate Devas
services. Further, Antrix shall provide appropriate technical assistance to
Devas on a best effort basis for obtaining required operating licenses and
Regulatory Approvals from various ministries so as to deliver Devas
services via satellite and terrestrial networks. However the cost of
obtaining such approvals shall be borne by Devas”;

Further, under Article 12(a)(ii), Antrix, through ISRO/the Department of
Space (the “DOS”), was “responsible for obtaining clearances from
National and International agencies (WPC, International
Telecommunications Union, etc.) for use of the orbital slot and frequency
resources so as to ensure that the spacecraft is operated meeting its
technical characteristics and provide the Leased Capacity as specified”;

Finally, according to Article 12(b)(vii), Devas was “solely responsible for
securing and obtaining all licenses and approval[s] ([s]tatutory or
otherwise) for the delivery of Devas Services via satellite and terrestrial

network”.

DT’s INVOLVEMENT IN DEVAS

In October 2007, Devas’s representative, Dr. Rajendra Singh, first approached
Mr. Hamid Akhavan, then CEO of T-Mobile International AG, a DT subsidiary, to
discuss a possible partnership.”° By that time, Devas had already secured equity
investments from Columbia Capital LLC and Telecom Ventures LLC, who had
both invested in Devas through their Mauritian subsidiaries.

The Claimant submits that the Devas project matched DT’s strategy to invest in
early-stage players in emerging markets to which it could add value through its
expertise in planning and designing terrestrial networks.2° DT thus undertook a
review of Devas’s business plan and financial model.*° From late 2007 to early
2008, DT’s representative, Dr. Kim Larsen (one of the Claimant's witnesses),
worked with Devas to review Devas’s business plan and financial model.*'
Additionally, in December 2007, Devas organized several meetings between DT
and the representatives of ISRO, the Department of Space and the Space
Commission on ISRO’s premises in Bangalore. At this time, Mr. Scheuermann
(another one of the Claimant's witnesses) was preparing DT’s internal enterprise
valuation of Devas* by reference to cash flows drawn from the business plan and
financial model and incorporating DT’s own valuation assumptions in view of the
tisks associated with investing in Devas.*%? The valuation at which Mr.
Scheuermann arrived amounted to USD 1.78 billion.

On 19 February 2008, DT’s Management Board discussed the prospects of
investing in Devas and reviewed the related valuation. The Board considered
such investment in line with DT’s business strategy, but identified risks, such as
the start-up nature of the business, the unclear status of the WPC License and
the limited nature of DT’s corporate governance rights.54 To minimize the risks,

the Management Board approved an initial equity investment of USD 75 million

instead of USD 150 million as previously contemplated.°>

On 19 March 2008, DT’s wholly-owned Singaporean subsidiary Deutsche
Telekom Asia Pte Ltd (“DT Asia”) signed a share subscription agreement with
Devas.°° The agreement contemplated that DT Asia would acquire class C
shares in Devas in exchange of a USD 75 million equity contribution. On
18 August 2008, DT Asia closed the share purchase by paying the agreed
USD 75 million and acquiring 28,349 class C shares in Devas, i.e. 17.2% of

Devas’s paid up share capital.°”

In the middle of 2009, Devas sought an additional capital contribution from DT.
In assessing the proposed further investment, DT and Devas updated Devas’s
business plan and financial model.** Applying further assumptions to the cash
flows of the updated model, Mr. Scheuermann calculated that Devas’s enterprise

value amounted to USD 1.15 billion.°°

On 10 August 2009, DT’s Management Board approved a further capital
contribution of USD 40 million based on an enterprise value of USD 375 million,
as did DT’s Supervisory Board on 28 August 2009.*° Devas then reduced its

capital call to USD 25 million.*"

On 29 September 2009, DT Asia agreed to make a further equity contribution in
Devas in the amount of USD 22.2 million.4 Consequently, DT Asia acquired
8,400 additional class C shares in Devas and increased its shareholding to

EVENTS PRIOR TO ANNULMENT

On 18 August 2008, Devas received its Internet Service Provider License (“ISP
License”) as well as approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.*®

On 20 August 2008, Devas applied for a temporary experimental license from the
Wireless Planning and Coordination Wing (the “WPC”) of India’s Department of
Telecommunications (the “DOT”) in order to test its system using the S-band
spectrum terrestrially.4© On 7 May 2009, the “Short Term Experiment/Trial”
License was granted for a small fee (“WPC Experimental License”).4”

On 31 March 2009, Devas was granted permission from the DOT to supply
Internet Protocol Television (“IPTV”) services through its ISP License which
enabled Devas to deliver internet services as provided in the Devas Agreement.“®

In September 2009, Devas conducted experimental trials in Bangalore which
were successful,“9 and in August 2010 it completed the second phase of trials.5°

After the completion of this phase, Devas and its advisors began preparing a draft
application for a particular license which it required from the WPC to reuse
Devas’s spectrum terrestrially (the “WPC License”).5'

In May 2010, terrestrial Broadband Wireless Access (“BWA”) spectrum auctions
took place in India, which resulted in the company Infotel acquiring the right to

The WPC License application was never filed due to the annulment of the Devas
Agreement on 8 February 2011, when Secretary Radhakrishnan and
Dr. Kasturirangan, a former ISRO Chairman and the DOS Secretary, announced
at a press conference the decision to terminate the Devas Agreement. On this
occasion, Devas learned for the first time about the purported termination of the
Agreement. On 25 February 2011, Antrix notified Devas of the termination of the
Agreement due to a force majeure event, by reference to the decision of the
Indian Cabinet Committee on Security (“CCS”).5?

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

Prior to considering the merits of the Parties’ positions on quantum, the Tribunal
will address the applicable laws (infra at IV.A),°° and the Claimant's objection to
the evidence of India’s damages expert (infra at IV.B).

APPLICABLE LAWS

Applicable procedural law

In the Terms of Appointment signed on 3 June 2014, the Parties agreed on the

law governing the procedure of this arbitration as follows:
“40. In order of priority, the procedure in this arbitration shall be governed by
the mandatory provisions of the law of the seat on international arbitration,

these Terms of Appointment, the rules on procedure contained in Article 9 of
the BIT and the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

41. If the provisions therein do not address a specific procedural issue, the
applicable procedural issue shall be determined by agreement between the
Parties or, in the absence of such agreement, by the Arbitral Tribunal.”54

Under Paragraph 37 of the Terms of Appointment, the Parties agreed to set the
seat of this arbitration in Geneva, Switzerland, with the result that this arbitration
is subject to Chapter 12 of the Swiss Private International Law Act.

Applicable substantive law
a. Law governing the merits of the dispute

In respect of the law applicable to the merits, the BIT contains the following
provision (Article 9(2)(b)(ii)):

“The arbitral award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this

Agreement, the relevant national laws including the rules on the conflict of

laws of the Contracting Party where the investment dispute arises as well as

the generally recognised principles of international law.”5>
Therefore, in addition to the BIT, the Tribunal will apply Indian national law and
generally recognized principles of international law whenever appropriate. Where
necessary, it will determine whether an issue is subject to national or international
law depending on the nature of the issue.5°

b. Jura novit arbiter

When applying the governing law, be it international or national, the Tribunal is
not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. Under the
maxim jura novit curia — or, better, jura novit arbiter — the Tribunal is required to
apply the law of its own motion, provided it seeks the Parties’ views if it intends
to base its decision on a legal theory that was not addressed and that the Parties
could not reasonably anticipate.5”

THE CLAIMANT'S OBJECTION TO THE EVIDENCE OF INDIA’S DAMAGES EXPERT

It is the Claimant's submission that the evidence of India’s damages expert,
Dr. Flores, should be completely disregarded. According to DT, it became clear

Agreement between Germany and India for the Promotion and Protection of Investments,
10 July 1995, Exh. C-001. Article 11 of the BIT further provides as follows: “All investments
shall, subject to this Agreement, be governed by the laws in force in the territory of the
Contracting Party in which such investments are made”. The Parties have not referred to
this provision in the relevant section of the Terms of Appointment.

at the Hearing that Dr. Flores’ expert testimony was based on a counterfactual
that incorrectly interpreted the Tribunal’s liability findings, or on evidence that
should, in DT’s view, not be considered in the counterfactual.®° Dr. Flores’
conclusions were based, so says DT, on his “own economic interpretation of the
Interim Award”.5° DT further contends that Dr. Flores did not perform the role of
an independent expert in this arbitration, but rather acted as an advocate for
India.®

The Tribunal has taken note of the Claimant's criticisms of Dr. Flores. Having
reviewed his evidence (both as contained in his two reports and as presented at
the Hearing) against the Claimant's allegations, the Tribunal considers there is
no ground to disregard Dr. Flores’ evidence entirely, a conclusion that would be
disproportionate having regard to the criticisms made. Rather, the Tribunal will
deal with the adequacy of Dr. Flores’ evidence as a matter of probative value as
and when such evidence becomes relevant in the course of its analysis.

DISCUSSION

In this section, the Tribunal first discusses the standard of proof applicable to
causation, loss and quantification of damages (infra at V.A). In that context, it also
addresses the uncertainty surrounding the issuance of the requisite licenses, in
particular the WPC License (infra at V.A.1.b). Thereafter, it examines the various
valuation methods discussed by the Parties (infra at V.B). Finally, it addresses
interest and tax (infra at V.C) and the effect of the ICC Award (infra at V.D).

CAUSATION, VALUATION, AND THE LICENSING ISSUES
The Claimant’s position

a. The standard of proof

It is beyond doubt, so says the Claimant, that the annulment of the Agreement
resulted in the destruction of the value of DT’s investment in Devas. The only

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 24 of 125

question that remains to be resolved is the precise amount of damages to be

awarded.®

For the Claimant, the uncertainty which Devas faced around obtaining the
necessary licenses is an issue relevant to the quantification of damages and not
a matter relevant to the fact of loss “because what DT lost was the FMV of its
investment in Devas as at the Valuation Date pre-licensing”.® The licensing
uncertainty must, therefore, be accounted for when assessing the FMV of DT’s
investment in Devas by factoring into the value the risk of the license not being

granted.®&

In this regard, it is the Claimant's contention that the decision in Bilcon v.
Canada* on which the Respondent relies does not support the latter's argument
that DT must prove “with virtual certainty” that it would have been granted the
WPC License.® According to the Claimant, the finding in Bilcon hinged on “a pure
lost profits valuation”.© It is for that reason that the Bilcon tribunal held that the
claimant was required to prove “with a certain level of probability” that it would
have obtained the necessary regulatory approvals in order to establish that
“future profits were indeed lost”.®” By contrast, in this case the loss sought is the
FMV of the asset prior to the annulment of the Agreement. The licensing
uncertainty in this situation goes to the amount of the loss, not to its existence.
The Claimant finds support for this argument in the concurring opinion of Prof.

Schwartz in Bilcon.®®

Thus a “proper reading” of Bilcon, so says DT, supports the Claimant's primary
argument that the licensing uncertainty is a risk to be factored into the FMV of

DT’s investment in Devas.®° The Claimant further contends that Bilcon is easily
distinguishable on the facts.’°

In the alternative, if the Tribunal were to determine that a certain standard of proof
must be applied in assessing the licensing risk, it is the Claimant’s argument that
the appropriate standard is whether “in all probability” the requisite licenses would
have been granted, which must be read to mean “probable’, and not merely
‘possible”’.’' This follows from Lemire v. Ukraine where the tribunal held that:
“Given the characteristics of the Ukrainian process for the awarding of
licences, it is impossible to establish, with total certainty, how specific tenders
would have been awarded if the National Council had not violated the FET
standard. The best that the Tribunal can expect Claimant to prove is that
through a line of natural sequences it is probable — and not simply possible —
that Gala would have been awarded the frequencies under tender.””2
The Claimant does not dispute that it bears the burden of establishing causation
and the value of the loss allegedly suffered. In terms of standard of proof, it
distinguishes, however, between the standard applied to the fact of the loss and
the standard applied to the quantification.” As concerns the former, the Claimant
argues that the relevant standard to be applied is one of “balance of probabilities”,
or, in other words, “such loss must be shown to be ‘probable’ and not merely
‘possible”.’* With regard to the latter, relying again on Lemire, the Claimant
argues that it need only “provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with
reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss”.’”> The lower standard for
proving the amount of the loss, so says the Claimant, is all the more appropriate
when the Claimant faces evidentiary challenges in proving the precise amount of

loss as a consequence of the Respondent's wrongful conduct,’® as is the case
here.

b. The licensing issues and the counterfactual
(i) General remarks

The Claimant contends that, in order to ensure full reparation, compensation must
be awarded so as to put DT in the position in which it would be if the Agreement
had not been annulled.’”” The most appropriate way to achieve this, according to
DT, is to take the FMV of DT’s investment in Devas as the starting point for
assessing damages. In this regard, FMV is defined as:

“the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would

change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a

hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at arm’s length in an open and

unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when

both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.””°
In determining the FMV of DT’s investment, the Tribunal should apply a
counterfactual which assumes that Devas would have received all the necessary
licenses. This, so says DT, is a well-settled principle of international law,”° as set
out by the tribunal in Burlington v. Ecuador:

“In the Tribunal’s view, when quantifying the value of the expropriated assets,

the Tribunal must proceed on the basis that Burlington is entitled to exercise

all of the contractual rights it would have had but for the expropriation, and

that Ecuador would have complied with its contractual obligations going

forward. In other words, when building the counterfactual scenario in which
the expropriation has not occurred, the Tribunal must assume that Burlington

holds the rights that made up the expropriated assets and that those rights
are respected.” °

In this case, this means removing all consequences of the breaches found by the
Tribunal*' and assuming a counterfactual scenario in which:

a

the launch of the GSAT-6 satellite would have taken place in April 2011;
b

India would have acted “fairly and reasonably” in treating Devas’s
application for the WPC License to permit terrestrial reuse of its
spectrum; and

c) if needed, Devas would have acquired any service license in addition to
the ISP and the IPTV licenses it already held.

In applying the correct counterfactual, the Tribunal should, so says DT, disregard
“[all] documents produced in the course of the flawed process that culminated in
the annulment of the Devas Agreement”.®?

(ii) The launch of the GSAT-6 satellite would have taken place in

April 2011
DT recalls that the Devas Agreement required ISRO/Antrix to launch the GSAT-
6 by the end of June 2009.® The launch of the GSAT-6 satellite was delayed a
number of times for operational reasons, such as lack of a launch vehicle due to
the explosion of a newly-designed ISRO vehicle for an unrelated satellite.
However, DT contends that all major operational issues had been resolved by
December 2010 and that in April 2011, at the latest, the GSAT-6 satellite would
have been launched.®>

For the Claimant, April 2011 is a conservative estimate for the launch date. As
such, it is the appropriate counterfactual date because it removes most of the
wrongful delay attributable to the Indian authorities’ “slow-rolling” of the GSAT-6

project as a consequence of the decision to annul the Agreement made by
July 2010.8

(iii) India would most probably have granted the WPC License for

a reasonable fee
It is the Claimant's submission that, upon fixing a firm launch date for GSAT-6,
Devas would have promptly finalized its application for the WPC License (which
had been prepared prior to the annulment of the Agreement) and submitted it to
the WPC.®’ Following the submission, had it not been for India’s Treaty breaches,
Devas would most probably have been granted the WPC License for a
reasonable fee.®°

More specifically, in the Claimant's view, it must be assumed that the DOT or any
other governmental authority would not have acted “arbitrarily, irrationally or
capriciously” and that India would thus not have denied Devas the WPC License
or levied “a prohibitive fee in exchange”.8? Such assumption, so says the
Claimant, is consistent with the approach adopted by numerous investment
tribunals that have awarded damages to an investor in a situation where a State
sought a reduction in damages based on the investor's need to obtain a license,
permit or other government approval.°°

DT admits that it had no contractual right or government assurance to be granted
the WPC License. However, according to the Claimant, this is legally irrelevant
because the Tribunal is simply being asked to consider the /ikelihood that the
WPC License would have been granted. Furthermore, India’s erroneous
suggestion that Devas had no value without the WPC License contradicts the
Tribunal’s finding in the Interim Award that, regardless of the WPC License,
Devas had “a binding agreement contemplating the lease of valuable satellite
spectrum”.%

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 29 of 125

Against that background, DT argues that Devas would have been granted the
WPC License for terrestrial use for a reasonable fee. Devas had acquired “non-
preemptible” contractual rights in relation to the spectrum. Thus, Devas only
required “procedural clearance” from the WPC to reuse terrestrially the
frequencies already allocated to Devas by the DOS, as opposed to allocation of
fresh spectrum from the DOT. As such, the role of the WPC would be “purely
operational”.° While the Claimant accepts that no WPC License had ever been
granted before, “it was not without regulatory precedents”.% In particular, in 2009,
the WPC had already issued Devas an experimental license for the conduct of
trials of its hybrid satellite and terrestrial system “for a nominal fee”. All that was
needed for Devas's terrestrial reuse permission was the application for the WPC
License and authorization, in line with India’s 2008 National Frequency Allocation

Plans (“NFAPs”), rather than a change in the band allocation policy.%

If any substantive review had been required, such that the application for the
WPC License was referred to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (the
“TRAI”),°6 the latter would have taken into account relevant international
precedent, which, according to the Claimant, overwhelmingly supported
terrestrial reuse of spectrum by an incumbent satellite operator.” The most likely
outcome of such review would have been the grant of the WPC License on
reasonable terms.°® This is so because the spectrum was already allocated to
Devas; all other operators had been “boxed out”? of its spectrum; and Devas’s

This is because, among other reasons, if two players were to operate in the same
frequencies spectrum in parallel, there would have to be coordination with “guard bands”
and “spatial buffer zones”, which would have led to substantial pockets of the spectrum
being left unused, as well as other practical and strategic considerations. Annex to the

services would actually implement India’s public policy objectives.'°° Indeed, the
services offered by Devas were in the public interest and would have provided
“truly universal, nationwide AV coverage to all of India, including its vast rural
areas”.'°' Moreover, Devas had the full support of the DOS.1°

In this regard, for the Claimant, the Respondent's “regulatory” witnesses, namely
Mr. Nitin Jain, Mr. Bhagirath and Smt. M. Revathi, were not credible since they
merely put forward their personal opinions about a regulatory licensing process
that was unclear.'°? Moreover, says DT, they “sit several rungs below the levels
of Secretary or Minister at which actual policy decisions would be taken”,'° they
lacked contemporaneous involvement with and knowledge of the relevant facts,
and they were “partial and lacking in objectivity”.1°

As to the fee charged for the WPC License, contrary to the Respondent's
allegation, such fee would not have been commensurate with the 2010 BWA
Spectrum Auction price set in accordance with India’s so-called “level playing
field policy” (i.e. a policy said to be designed to ensure a level playing field for the
other services providers using terrestrial spectrum). DT identifies several reasons
for this.

First, India’s ultimate decision to annul the Agreement in order to vacate the
spectrum demonstrates that the spectrum was not capable of being auctioned
while Devas’s contractual rights were in force.

Second, Devas’s position is different from the holders of rights in the 2010 BWA
Spectrum Auction, because Devas had exclusive use of the spectrum, was
primarily a satellite spectrum holder seeking to reuse its spectrum terrestrially,
rather than primarily a terrestrial spectrum holder, and it intended to provide
different services (including AV services).'°’ Furthermore, there has never been

a terrestrial spectrum auction fee placed on a terrestrial reuse license, which is
fundamentally different from a pure terrestrial use of the spectrum.'% That
fundamental difference is evident from the fact that Devas would have had to
launch a satellite in order to be able to reuse the spectrum for terrestrial
purposes. 19

Third, even if the regulators were required to consider India’s level playing field
policy, they nevertheless would have to balance that policy against other public
policy objectives.''° As a result, they would have charged an affordable fee given
the public benefits which Devas would have provided.""?

Finally, the Claimant submits that the ISP and IPTV Licenses that it already held
were sufficiently flexible for the provision of Devas’s services.''? These licenses
did cover the provision of BWA and AV services." In any case, India would be
reasonably expected to put in place licenses for the operation of BWA and AV
services and in the meantime permit the launch of such services by Devas, as it
had done in similar circumstances.""4 In other words, even if additional necessary
licenses did not exist, they would have been created."'® Thus, any delay to the
start of Devas’s services would have been minimal.

The Respondent’s position
a. The standard of proof

According to India, the “threshold question” before the Tribunal is whether, but
for the annulment of the Agreement, (i) Devas would have obtained the necessary

licenses to enable it to roll out its proposed business, and (ii) reasonable
spectrum charges would have been applied."'”

Thus, for the Respondent, the core licensing issues in dispute are matters that
need to be proven in order to establish a causal link between the breach of the
Treaty and the loss.''® In assessing those core licensing issues, the applicable
legal standard is one of “in all probability” or “with a sufficient degree of certainty”.
In support of this contention, the Respondent relies on Bilcon, where the tribunal
held:1"9

“Authorities in public international law require a high standard of factual

certainty to prove a causal link between breach and injury: the alleged injury

must “in all probability” have been caused by the breach [...] or a conclusion

with a “sufficient degree of certainty” is required that, absent a breach, the
injury would have been avoided.

In this regard, the test is whether the Tribunal is “able to conclude from the

case as a whole and with a sufficient degree of certainty” that the damage or

losses of the Investors “would in fact have been averted if the Respondent

had acted in compliance with its legal obligations” under NAFTA.”
The Respondent stresses that Bilcon applies to “all aspects of the Tribunal’s
finding of liability, including non-transparency in the decision-making process and
the annulment itself”."2° In this regard, India draws the Tribunal’s attention to the
fact that in Bilcon the tribunal “went on to note that various outcomes of a ‘NAFTA-
compliant process’ were ‘reasonably conceivable’, including a refusal to approve
the project based on socio-economic considerations and an approval ‘with
conditions that would render [the project] economically unviable’”.'*' The Bilcon
tribunal thus concluded that “[w]ithout a high degree of certainty as to regulatory
approval, it goes without saying that no damages based on the profitable
operation of the quarry can be awarded”.'2 Contrary to the Claimant's

submission, according to the Respondent, there is “no meaningful distinction
between Bilcon and this case”."25

Finally, in support of its argument that this is the appropriate standard of proof to
be applied to the licensing issues, the Respondent submits that, until the hearing,
the Claimant accepted that the relevant standard was “in all probability”. It was
only when the Claimant realized that this burden was insurmountable that it
started arguing that the Tribunal should consider the core licensing issues as part
of the FMV of its investment. In the alternative, it also submitted that “in all
probability” should be interpreted as meaning “probable, not possible”.'*4

b. The licensing issues and the counterfactual

For the Respondent, the Claimant's counterfactual is entirely misplaced because
it is based on the assumption that Devas had a right to be granted all of the ‘“first-
of-their-kind” licenses needed at a cost that guaranteed economic success.
According to India:

a) As DT was aware, India had no obligation to grant the WPC License
and DT should not be able to claim for a right it never had (infra at
V.A.2.b(i));

b) DT fully understood that there was significant risk that the licenses
would not be granted (infra at V.A.2.b(ii)-(iii)); and

c) DT has failed to prove that the spectrum fees would have been set at
a level that would have enabled Devas to be profitable (infra at
V.A.2.b(iv)).

(i) India had no obligation to grant the WPC License and DT
should not be able to claim for a right it never had

100. The Respondent submits that there was no obligation on India to grant the WPC

123

124

125

License to Devas. As set out in the Agreement, both the responsibility and the
risk associated with obtaining the WPC License fell exclusively on Devas.'?5 In

fact, the Government retained the right “to declare that there would be no
commercial use of S-band spectrum without auction”.'° For the Respondent, the
value of Devas is to be assessed on the basis of the rights that it had, as opposed
to rights that it did not have.'?”

101. Furthermore, the Respondent contends that any misunderstanding about the

conditions for acquiring the WPC License on the part of DT can only be attributed
to Devas. In this regard, the Respondent refers to the negotiating history of the
share purchase agreement between DT Asia and Devas in 2008, where Devas
did not make DT fully aware of all licenses required for the rolling out of the Devas
business.128

(ii) The requisite licenses would not have been issued

102. India argues that the documentary and testimonial evidence on record shows that

the required licenses, and in particular the WPC License, would not have been
issued.'?° There is an abundance of evidence, so says India, demonstrating that
DT would not have received the relevant licenses.

103. First, the terrestrial reuse of Devas’s S-band spectrum, via either the terrestrial

repeaters of AV content or the terrestrial network for BWA services, was not
permitted absent a “change in policy”, as such spectrum had not been authorized
for terrestrial use previously.'*° The licenses required by DT were “first-of-a-kind”
licenses; they did not exist and the grant of such licenses necessitated a change
in policy and in India’s band segmentation.'*! The need for a change in policy and
the novelty of terrestrial reuse would have required a reference to the TRAI. The
consultative process before the TRAI would have involved considering the views

of all of the stakeholders.'*? It was “reasonably conceivable” that the outcome of
the TRAI consultation would have been unfavorable to DT.

In response to DT’s contention that a policy change could have been made in
accordance with international precedents, India argues that (i) DT has
mischaracterized the international precedents on which it relies; and (ii) “while the
TRAI may look to international precedents in regard to certain matters, it reaches
conclusions that are in its judgment specific to the Indian situation’’*> and the
Government is not required to follow TRAI’s conclusions." In any event, to
suggest that India could have changed its policy falls short of DT satisfying its
burden of proof that India would have done so and that Devas would have been
granted the licenses.'95

Second, at the 2 July 2010 meeting of the Space Commission — during which the
Space Commission recommended the annulment of the Agreement — numerous
concerns were aired about (i) the anticipated terrestrial use of the spectrum for
the purposes of hybrid services, (ii) the fact that the DOT needed to be consulted,
(iii) Devas’s foreign ownership, and (iv) awarding the use of the spectrum in a
manner inconsistent with the level playing field policy. All of these factors would
have weighed against the granting of the license.'°°

Third, Mr. Jain, the DOT’s Deputy Director General for Data Services, Ms.
Revathi and Mr. Bhagirath, both Senior Deputy Wireless Advisors, have testified
that it was unlikely that the requisite change in policy would have been made.'%”
The Respondent refutes DT’s arguments in relation to the weight that should be
attached to the witness testimony of the regulators. It also points to the fact that
DT has failed to call (and to provide any explanation for its failure) any Indian
regulatory witness, any individual in charge of regulatory matters on DT’s due
diligence team or its Indian lawyers or advisors consulted in relation to the

licenses.'%8 It presumably failed to do so, says India, because their testimony
would have been detrimental to DT’s case.

Furthermore, there is no merit in the Claimant's position that the failure to grant
the WPC License would have been “arbitrary, irrational and capricious”, as the
possibility of denial of the requisite licenses was acknowledged even in DT’s
internal documents.'®® Moreover, according to India, it would have been perfectly
valid for the Government to deny the licenses on the basis that terrestrial use of
the spectrum could not be granted without an auction. It is untenable to argue
that such conduct is “arbitrary, irrational or capricious” or otherwise contrary to
the Treaty.14°

(iii) DT fully understood that there was significant risk that the
licenses would not be granted
In India’s submission, it is clear from the contemporaneous documents that DT
was well aware of the risk that the requisite licenses would not be granted. India
argues that, during its due diligence, DT identified the need to acquire the WPC
License and recognized the risks associated with the issuance of that license.'4"
These facts are established, inter alia, by the following elements in the record:

. DT’s internal documents record DT’s reservations about the grant of
the license, including after DT’s officials met with India’s Wireless
Advisor to discuss this matter;"4

. The uncertainty surrounding the grant of the WPC License was
factored in by DT itself when it invested in Devas, as is shown by
(i) DT’s decrease of the valuation of Devas and its proposal for a
staged investment, and (ii) the fact that it obtained priority shares

ensuring that in the event of a liquidation or sale of the company, DT
Asia would receive preferential treatment vis-a-vis holders of ordinary
shares;'48

. In the lead up to its second investment in Devas, DT continued to take
note of the licensing risks."44

109. According to the Respondent, the Claimant admitted that it was fully cognizant of

the licensing risk'*° and Mr. Harman of FTI testified at the Hearing that DT was
well aware of the significant uncertainty surrounding the WPC License.'4® Such
statements are irreconcilable with the Claimant’s position that the requisite
licenses would have been granted in all probability.

(iv) DT has failed to prove that the spectrum fees would have been
set at a level that would have enabled Devas to be profitable

110. The Respondent argues that even if the licenses had been issued, the regulators

143

144

would have charged fees for the use of the spectrum commensurate with auction
values in accordance with India’s level playing field policy,'4” which would have
meant that the project would have been economically unviable. For India, the
level playing field policy remains “the core of India regulatory policy to this day”.
It invokes a number of documents from its regulators as well as statements of its
witnesses to this effect,'4* in particular:

. As confirmed by Ms. Revathi, the level playing field policy “means
exactly what it says — that companies using the same (or similar)
spectrum or desiring to provide the same types of services are required
to endure the same fees and charges, and the Government is not

. Second, “no one in India provides BWA services, and no one has ever
been authorised to provide BWA services, without paying auction
prices”, even existing service providers would have been required to
pay a fee to upgrade their services “commensurate with auction
prices”.° The granting of such a license would have required a
fundamental change in Indian regulatory policy and the evidence
before the Tribunal is that such a change would not have taken
place;'5*

. Third, the July 2010 DOT Letters made it clear that spectrum charges
in line with auction values would be assessed for the proposed satellite-
terrestrial business.'** There is no reason to disregard this letter, as
there is nothing unlawful about the Secretary of the DOT reminding the
DOS that, in accordance with the level playing field policy, the spectrum
charges would have to equate auction fees.'5°

(such as providing telecom services to rural areas) could not have compelled the
issuance of the WPC License contrary to India’s level playing field policy.'*4 As

confirmed by Ms. Revathi and Mr. Bhagirath, public interest has never prevailed
over public policy.15°

The Respondent further refutes the Claimant's position that Devas had a “box-
out” position. It explains that Devas would not have such a position of 60 MHz all
over India, in particular because any box-out “would have been limited to the two
10-MHz blocks directed at the specific footprints on the surface”,'5° and it would
have been a dereliction of duty if it operated (as the Claimant contends) to prevent
the application of the level playing field policy.'5”

For the Respondent, these arguments are bolstered by the fact that in its damage
calculations the Claimant’s quantum expert, FTI, assigns a one-third weight to
the scenario with auction-level fees, which shows that such a hypothesis is
“eminently plausible”.'5°

In sum, DT has not met its burden of proving that India would have departed from
its level playing field policy when assessing fees for the use of the spectrum in
the event that it had granted the requisite licenses. Because such fees would
have been equivalent to auction fees, so says India, the proposed Devas
business would not have been viable.

Finally, India submits that Devas only had an ISP/IPTV License that did not permit
the provision of the purported AV or BWA services.'®° More specifically, the
ISP/IPTV license that Devas had could not be used for wireless ISP services
except in the 2.7-2.9 GHz and 3.3-3.4 GHz bands and in unlicensed spectrum,
as opposed to the S-band spectrum at issue here; additionally, the ISP license
only permitted transmission to fixed receivers and not to mobile devices.'® In
fact, India did not even have service licenses for AV satellite services to mobile
devices or for BWA services in the portion of S-band in question.'®"

Analysis

The Tribunal discusses first the standard(s) of proof for issues of causation, loss,
and quantification of damages (infra at V.A.3.a). Thereafter, in light of that
discussion, it addresses the uncertainty regarding the licenses (infra at V.A.3.b).

a. Requirements for damage award and standard of proof

There is no serious disagreement between the Parties as to the applicability in
the present case of the standard of full reparation set out by the PClu in its 1928
judgment in Chorzéw.'®* The same standard is found in Article 31 of the
International Law Commission Articles on State Responsibility (the “ILC Articles”)
and adopted by many investment treaty tribunals. '®

The Parties do, however, disagree on the standards for causation and loss. They
equally diverge on whether the licensing uncertainties which DT faced (i.e.
whether Devas would have obtained the WPC License needed to roll out its
business at a reasonable fee) are matters that go to causation or valuation.

The Tribunal begins its analysis by recalling that, in accordance with Article 31 of
the ILC Articles, the determination of damages under international law implies a
three-step process:

. establishing a breach;
ii. ascertaining that the injury was caused by that breach (causation); and
ii. determining the amount of compensation due for the injury caused

(valuation or quantification of damages).'**

120. The first step was taken in the Interim Award, in which the Tribunal held that

India’s conduct, ultimately culminating in the Devas Agreement being annulled,
constituted a breach of the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard.'® In
particular, the Tribunal found that “the decision to annul the Agreement was
arbitrary and unjustified inasmuch as it was manifestly not based on facts, but on
conclusory allegations, and was the product of a flawed process”.'®° The Tribunal
concluded that “[a]s a consequence of the acts which the Tribunal deemed
contrary to FET, the Devas Agreement was annulled”.'°”

121. The second step requires showing a causal link between the breach and the

alleged injury. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in Bilcon that
“[ajuthorities in public international law require a high standard of factual certainty
to prove a causal link between breach and injury: the alleged injury must ‘in all
probability’ have been caused by the breach (as in Chorzow), or a conclusion
with a ‘sufficient degree of certainty’ is required that, absent a breach, the injury
would have been avoided (as in [the] Genocide [case decided by the ICJ])”."®

122. In this case, unlike what the Respondent appears to suggest, the causation issue

is not whether, but for India’s unlawful conduct, Devas would have obtained the
requisite licenses; rather, the relevant question is whether there is a causal link
between India’s unlawful conduct resulting in the annulment of the Agreement
and the loss in the value of DT’s investment in Devas. The Tribunal is of the view
that, in this case, there can be no doubt that the annulment of the Agreement
caused the diminution in the value of DT’s investment.

123. Indeed, on 17 February 2011, when the CCS made its final decision to annul the

165

166

167

168

Devas Agreement, which the Parties agree to treat as the date of valuation (the

for the breach of an international obligation consists of three steps - [i] the establishment
of the breach, followed by [ii] the ascertainment of the injury caused by the breach,
followed by [iii] the determination of the appropriate compensation for that injury”); Bilcon,

Id., para. 416. In the same paragraph, the Tribunal also concluded that, because of the
nature of the conduct found to constitute a breach of the Treaty, “even if the same facts
were found to also constitute an expropriation, the ensuing damages would not be
greater”.

Bilcon, Exh. RLA-218, para. 110.

“Valuation Date”),'® the value of Devas was derived from Devas’s proposed
business. It should be recalled that Devas was incorporated for the very purpose
of entering into the Devas Agreement.'”° Furthermore, the key asset held by
Devas on the Valuation Date was the right to lease the spectrum. Under the
circumstances, there can be no doubt that by annulling the Agreement, India’s
conduct negatively impacted, if not entirely destroyed, the value of DT’s
investment in Devas, by depriving Devas of the key asset required to roll out its
proposed business.

124. Bearing in mind the Chorzéw and Genocide standards of proof mentioned

above,'”' in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant has thus established that the loss
(ie. the diminution of value of its investment in Devas) has “in all probability”
(pursuant to the Chorzéw standard) or to “a sufficient degree of certainty”
(pursuant to the Genocide standard) been caused by India’s conduct.'”? Hence,
the Tribunal considers that causation between the breach and the (fact or
existence of the) loss has been established.

125. The Tribunal turns now to the third step, i.e. the valuation or quantification of

damages. As also recalled in Bilcon,'’? investment treaty case law draws a
distinction between the causation aspect just examined and quantification of the
amount of the loss, for which a lower standard of proof is required.

126. The tribunal in Lemire, for instance, noted that:

169

170

172

173

174

“[o]nce causation has been established, and it has been proven that the in
bonis party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the
actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs
to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence,
estimate the extent of the loss.”'”4

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 43 of 125

127. Other tribunals have come to the same conclusion. For instance, the tribunal in

Crystallex v. Venezuela, referring to Lemire, held:

“the fact (i.e., the existence) of the damage needs to be proven with certainty.
In that sense, there is no reason to apply any different standard of proof than
that which is applied to any other issue of merits (e.g., liability).

Second, once the fact of damage has been established, a claimant should not
be required to prove its exact quantification with the same degree of certainty.
This is because any future damage is inherently difficult to prove.”

128. As the tribunal in Vivendi /I further observed in respect of quantification,

“approximations are inevitable; the settling of damages is not an exact
science”.'7° Tribunals thus “retain a certain margin of appreciation” in the
quantification of the damage, as noted by the tribunal in Rusoro v. Venezuela.'7”

129. This point was clearly articulated in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, in which the

tribunal held:'78

“while a claimant must prove its damages to the required standard, the
assessment of damages is often a difficult exercise and it is seldom that
damages in an investment situation will be able to be established with
scientific certainty. This is because such assessments will usually involve
some degree of estimation and the weighing of competing (but equally
legitimate) facts, valuation methods and opinions, which does not of itself
mean that the burden of proof has not been satisfied. Because of this element
of imprecision, it is accepted that tribunals retain a certain amount of discretion
or a “margin of appreciation” when assessing damages, which will necessarily
involve some approximation. The use of this discretion should not be confused
with acting on an ex aequo et bono basis, even if equitable considerations are
taken into account in the exercise of such discretion. Rather, in such
circumstances, the tribunal exercises its judgment in a reasoned manner so
as to discern an appropriate damages sum which results in compensation to
Claimant in accordance with the principles of international law that have been
discussed earlier.”

130. Hence, once it is proven that the Claimant did suffer a loss, and that loss was

175

176

17

178

caused by the breach, the question is whether the Claimant has “provided the

Tribunal with a reasonable basis to assess” that loss'”9 or “a basis upon which
the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss”."®°

131. This being so, the Tribunal can move to assessing the extent of the loss. It is at

this step of the valuation exercise that it must factor in the probability (whatever
that probability is) of the relevant licenses being received. Thus, far from being
an element interrupting the causal chain, the risk concerning the licensing issues
that existed at the Valuation Date is a factor that must be taken into account -
among other elements - in the third step of the Tribunal’s analysis, i.e. the
quantification of the loss. This is consistent with the Tribunal’s observation in the
Interim Award whereby “[t]he absence of the WPC License may have made DT’s
investment less valuable and may thus have an impact on quantum”.181

132. — Still in respect of risk, the Tribunal observes that it is correct that, as the Claimant

submits, the applicable counterfactual must assume that India would have acted
in accordance with its Treaty obligations.'®? It also does not escape the Tribunal
that India’s breach deprived Devas of the opportunity to apply for the WPC
License. However, this does not mean that the Tribunal should disregard the risks
or uncertainties facing Devas irrespective of the Respondent’s breach. Hence,
for purposes of valuing the Claimant's loss, it is important to assess the risks,
especially the regulatory risks on which the Parties have mainly focused, that
Devas and its business would have faced even if the Agreement had not been
annulled.

133. Inthe next section, the Tribunal addresses the uncertainty regarding the licensing

issues. It discusses them at this juncture and in a certain detail given the
emphasis that both Parties have placed on this question in both their written and
oral submissions in this phase of the arbitration.

b. The licensing uncertainties
(i) Introductory remarks

Before turning to the evidence on these risks, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant
has called no regulatory witnesses or experts to testify on the relevant licensing
issues. By contrast, the Respondent has adduced evidence from three witnesses:
Mr. Nitin Jain, Deputy Director General in Data Services Wing of the DOT,
Mr. Bhagirath, Senior Deputy Wireless Advisors to the Government of India in the
WPC Wing of the DOT, and Smt. M. Revathi, Senior Deputy Wireless Advisors
to the Government of India in the WPC Wing of the DOT.

While it is true that the Tribunal would have preferred to hear from witnesses
closer to the facts and the decision-making power, the evidence of India’s
“regulatory witnesses” nevertheless proved somewhat helpful. The fact that they
did not have firsthand experience with the licenses at issue here, and would not
have decided over the WPC License, does not make their testimony wholly
“unreliable and unavailing”, to use the Claimant's words.

Against that background, the Tribunal turns to the two main issues in respect of
the licensing risks, i.e. whether the WPC would likely have been granted (infra at
V.A.3.b(ii)), and, if so, against which fee (infra at V.A.3.b(iii)).

(ii) Whether the WPC License would have been granted

It is common ground that Devas/DT did not have a contractual right to the
issuance of the WPC license nor a concrete assurance from India that such
license would be granted.'®° To the contrary, as explained below, whenever
Devas/DT sought to obtain assurances, the Indian authorities’ stance was non-
committal.

It is further not seriously disputed that the type of license sought by Devas, which
would have been required to roll out the services, had never been granted before

See Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, dated 2 October 2014, para. 319(c) (where
the Claimant explained that “DT does not assert that it had either a contractual right or a
concrete assurance from India that the WPC license would be granted”; Reply on
Jurisdiction and Liability, dated 26 June 2015, para. 186 (“DT has not claimed — and to
succeed in this arbitration does not need to claim — that the Agreement gave it or Devas
everything that Devas needed to implement fully the satellite and terrestrial Devas
Services as described in the Agreement, including a contractual right to obtain the WPC
License”).

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 46 of 125

in India. It was thus a “novel” or “first-of-a kind” license. As the Claimant itself put
it at the Hearing:

“In addition to various commercial risks, such as the greenfield nature of the
project and the satellite aspect of the platform, the board [of DT] was fully
advised of key legal and regulatory risks, including the need for a licence from
the WPC authorising terrestrial reuse of the satellite spectrum, which had
never before been issued or considered in India.”'®

139. Mr. Axmann, Vice President of DT’s Mergers & Acquisition team and project

manager tasked with evaluating DT’s investment opportunity in Devas, also
acknowledged that the envisaged services were “a very novel concept” in India:
“MR PREZIOSI: Now, you did understand [...] this was a novel set of services
in India, right?
A. In India, yes. That was our understanding.

Q. It’s correct, isn’t it, that at that time nobody had been providing AV
broadcasting services to mobile devices in India?

A. In India, | don't believe so.

Q. And nobody, in fact, had been providing AV broadcasting to mobile devices
terrestrially in India?

A. | would be able to confirm that. But it was a very novel concept, that was
our understanding, yes.”'85

140. The situation in which Devas found itself as the first-of-its-kind applicant of a

141.

184

185

186

license for “novel services” was also clearly understood by DT at the time, as is
shown by a multitude of documents in the record. It is useful to set out these
documents in chronological order.

First, in the lead up to its first acquisition of Devas’s shares, which was effected
in 2008, DT observed in an 11 December 2007 briefing that:

“[I]n a meeting with the head of WPC in Delhi, it became apparent that Devas’
assumption that is has secured a substantial spectrum via its contract with
ISRO may not go unchallenged by authorities other than ISRO, with the WPC-
Chairman indicating a need for further review.”1®

India? A. Correct.”).

46

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 47 of 125

142. Two months later, in a presentation dated 11 February 2008 prepared for the
meeting of the Management Board to be held on 19 February 2008, DT listed
three possible scenarios in respect of the project’s “regulatory issues”:

“License Requirements (cont'd):
Possible scenarios in the given context are:

A. WPC adopts the Devas position and takes the view that only
procedural/technical clearances are required by Devas, possibly along with
the payment of a fee for use of spectrum.

B. WPC concludes that the regulatory framework is unclear and that before it
can come to a decision, relevant rules need to be framed in connection with
the use by private operators of satellite spectrum in conjunction with a hybrid
network.

C. WPC takes the view that Devas is required to obtain a substantive
authorization from WPC in connection with the use of spectrum.

Scenario B. and C. would result in a substantial risk that the deployment of
the Devas network would get delayed, and perhaps even refused in certain
circumstances.

 

 

Other points of concern are that more generally, India has to be considered
as a highly regulated market, and it is difficult to foresee how it will evolve over
the near-to long-term.”'8”

143. At the Hearing, Mr. Axmann explained that, from DT’s point of view, scenario B
was in essence the most likely scenario:
“[MR AXMANN] Well, now that you mention it, scenario 1 and scenario 3
especially were given small probability. Indeed, our highest assumed

probability was that it would have to run through a certain process, but it would
be agreed then in the end.

Q. Okay. So just to be clear, A and C were given very small probability by DT,
and scenario B was the one that you were giving higher probability to?

A. From my perspective and from the team's perspective, yes.”

144. It is also important to note that the same presentation records “DT[’s] position” on
the fact that it understood that Devas needed a “separate specific authorization

market” and observed that “[pJotential consequences in this highly regulated market are
a dispute between the authorities, possibly initiated by competitors, that could lead to a
delay; worst case scenario would be a severe limitation in flexibility for terrestrial usage.
or a total loss of spectrum”. /d., p. 4 (emphasis added).

and license [...] from the WPC”'® (which was, therefore, in addition to any ISP
license that would have already been granted):

“DT Position: The fundamental concern to DT in the given context is that
Indian regulations explicitly stipulate that any ISP-licensee is required to
obtain ‘a separate specific authorization and license [...] from the WPC’, as
the responsible agency for spectrum licensing and management. In addition,
guidelines for Telecom Service Providers for Satellite Communications require
the licensee to approach the WPC to obtain frequency authorization.”'°

145. In a different briefing note prepared around the same time for the same board

meeting of 19 February 2008, DT also noted that it had obtained only “non-
committal” feedback from the WPC regarding the license, and that Devas was
“reluctant” to approach the authorities to obtain a confirmatory letter on that
matter despite DT’s request that it do so:

“To get clarity on the matter, DT (Kevin Copp in person, Hamid Akhavan via
telephone) did meet/talk with the Chairman of the WPC. However, the
feedback was non-committal. Accordingly, DT requested to eliminate any
uncertainties by way of confirmatory letter either from WPC directly or from
ISRO/DoS, explicitly confirming either the approval from, or the non-
responsibility of WPC. This has not been obtained so far and Devas has
indicated that, at least at this stage, it is reluctant to approach the authorities
with the request for a formal clarification.”"""

146. Eventually, DT chose not to require a confirmation on the licensing issue as a

189

192

condition to the 2008 transaction’? (a possibility previously identified in the

The excerpt from DT’s presentation quoted in the text in fact are taken from paragraph
36.1 of the ISP license, which states: “A separate specific authorization and licence
(hereinafter called WPC license) shall be required from the WPC wing of the Department
of Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications permitting utilization of appropriate
frequencies / band for establishment and possession and operation of Wireless element
of the Telecom Service. [...]” See Licence Agreement for Provision of Internet Services
Between Devas and DOT, dated 2 May 2008, Exh. C-083, para. 36.1. The Tribunal
accepts the explanation from Mr. Jain, the Deputy Director General in Data Services Wing
of the DOT, that paragraph 36.1 is generally applicable to all ISP services involving radio
frequencies (except in the case of unlicensed spectrum), and that in addition to the
requirements set forth therein, the special requirements in paragraph 36.6 applicable to
ISP services using the satellite media would also be applicable. See Jain WS1, para. 6.

Instead, it accounted for the licensing risks by significantly reducing the amount it was
willing to pay for its investment in Devas. It further determined that its investment should
be staged, with more substantial investments to be made by DT after satellite launch and
following the commencement of the roll out, by which time it considered that the WPC

195

briefing note discussed above).'®* Hence, it decided to pursue the acquisition in
full knowledge of the regulatory risks.

The uncertainty surrounding the WPC License resurfaced in 2009, when DT
acquired the second tranche of the Devas shares. For instance, in a briefing note
of 6 August 2009 to the Management Board, DT acknowledged that the
acquisition “will be subject to the same risk elements stated in the Board Papers
for the initial invest[ment] in 2008”, in particular “the pending confirmation or
license of the telecoms regulator for terrestrial usage of the spectrum”.'94

Similarly, DT’s submission to its Supervisory Board of 28 August 2009 provides
the following information under the heading “Risks”:

“Spectrum: A risk arises out of the questions surrounding the competencies
of various Indian authorities in connection with the exceptionally valuable
spectrum assigned to Devas. An exclusively satellite-based use of the
spectrum is guaranteed by the competence of ISRO; at least in an exclusively
terrestrial use of spectrum, on the other hand, a regulatory approval by the
Department of Telecommunications (DoT) would be necessary. It cannot
therefore be excluded that the DoT could infer a competence in case of a
subsequent terrestrial expansion.

Ll]

Explicit authorisations for the terrestrial use can however only be obtained
once the expansion of the network renders this necessary. Up to this point it
cannot be completely excluded that there will be complications. On the other
hand this risk element causes a lower valuation (see also the section ‘DT
investment activity’).”1%

 

The risks of “delay” or even “refusal” of the WPC License identified by DT (see
supra para. 142) were to a considerable extent linked to the multi-tier and multi-
step process that would have been required for the grant of the WPC License in

License risk would have been resolved. See Transcript, Day 1, p. 261, line 19 - p. 262,

light of its novelty. In particular, the decision over the WPC would in all likelihood
have entailed a governmental review in the form of the TRAI process.'%° This is
a public process.'%” It involves the preparation of consultation papers describing
the proposed service, which are subject to the input from stakeholders, including

Such multi-step public process involving consultations with key market players
would undeniably have added to the license’s uncertainty.

152. Notwithstanding the objective uncertainty emerging from the foregoing elements,

the Claimant has advanced a number of arguments whereby Devas would in all
likelihood have obtained the WPC License necessary to provide the Devas
services. The Tribunal is not convinced that the grant would have materialized
with the level of probability that the Claimant seeks to depict.

153. First, the Tribunal is unpersuaded that, lacking any precedent in India on these

types of licenses, the Government would have necessarily followed what the
Claimant refers to as “international precedents”. In the Tribunal’s view, such
“precedents” would have been but one factor that the regulatory authority might
have taken into consideration when assessing Devas’s application. It is also
reasonable to assume that the Indian governmental authorities would have
reached their own conclusions with specific regard to the Indian situation,
regardless of what other governmental authorities may have decided in respect
of their country-specific circumstances.” Hence, the Tribunal is not satisfied that
the resort to the “international precedents” increases the certainty that the WPC
License would have been granted to Devas.

154. Similarly, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the grant of the WPC License for

203

reuse of the terrestrial spectrum can be inferred from the fact that Devas had
received a WPC Experimental License. The WPC Experimental License was of
a different magnitude. As such, it constitutes no precedent in favor of the granting
of the (full) WPC License. Importantly, the text of the agreement in principle that
was issued by the WPC and of the experimental license itself made clear that the

For instance, as was discussed at the Hearing, in connection with the 2013 TRAI
recommendations on the auction of spectrum in, inter alia, the 3.4-3.6 GHz bands, the
TRAI reviewed the policies of the U.K.’s Ofcom and Ireland's Comreg with regard to roll-
out requirements and made recommendations that were consistent with one and
inconsistent with the other in regard to roll-out requirements. It also added
recommendations on a lock-in period that would prevent spectrum trading for five years,
which was not part of the recommendations of either country. See Transcript, Day 3,

license was “for experiments only”, that there could be “[nJo claim for regular use”
and that the “assignment is purely temporary”.2°*

The foregoing facts show that there was a certain degree of uncertainty around
the grant of the WPC License for terrestrial reuse of the satellite spectrum. That
uncertainty stemmed in large part from the fact that no such license had ever
been issued in India. The Tribunal thus cannot agree with the Claimant that
Devas merely required “procedural clearance” from the WPC. At a minimum, the
services Devas intended to offer would have necessitated the establishment of a
new licensing regime (under scenario B that DT accepted as the most likely). At
a maximum, they could also have required a change in the band segmentation
and in policy.2° In this latter respect, the need for a change in policy is unclear
from the record, precisely because of the lack of precedent. In any event, the
Tribunal can dispense with establishing this fact because the weight of the
evidence supports a conclusion that there was a certain degree of risk that the
license would not be granted, irrespective of a change in policy.

In sum, the record shows that there was a certain degree of uncertainty
surrounding the WPC License, an uncertainty of which DT was aware when it
made its investment in Devas. But in any event, as discussed below, this is
ultimately not determinative of the Tribunal’s decision on quantum.

(iii) The fee for the WPC License

In addition to the uncertainty regarding whether the WPC License would have
been granted, the price which Devas would have paid for such license is also
uncertain.

In essence, the Parties advance opposite views in this respect. For the Claimant,
the License would have been granted at “nominal” or “reasonable” fee. By
contrast, the Respondent assumes that India would have charged fees

commensurate to the auction charges paid by the winners of the 2010 BWA
Spectrum Auction.

159. The lack of a “regulatory framework in India for determining the potential fees for

the use of satellite spectrum for terrestrial networks in period 2008 to 2011"206
necessarily implies uncertainty about the level of the fees, as the Claimant's
damages expert accepts.?°” This being said, the Tribunal considers it reasonable
to assume that, had the Government decided to grant the WPC License, it would
have applied the “level playing field” policy, which appears well established in
India. As stated by the Indian High Court in Dual Technology, a case to which
both Parties refer, “‘[l]evel playing field[’] is a concept of fairness which ensures
not that each player has the equal chance to succeed, but that they all play by
the same set of rules”.2°8

160. The Tribunal, however, does not accept India’s position that the application of the

206

207

208

level playing field policy would have required the automatic imposition of a fee in
line with the 2010 BWA auction price. This is because, unlike the winning bidder
in that auction, Devas was an incumbent spectrum-holder, seeking approval from
the WPC for the terrestrial reuse of spectrum already allocated to it by the DOS,
rather than an allocation of fresh spectrum. Applying similar fees to operators in
such dissimilar situations would have negated rather than implemented the policy
of the level playing field. That said, it is reasonable to assume that, taking into
account these differences, the Indian authorities would have levied a fee to
ensure that all economic actors “play by the same set of rules”, which would not
have been the case with a “nominal” fee.

Harman ER1, para. 4.41.

See Harman ER1, para. 4.41 (“There was uncertainty around the applicability and
potential level of further licence fees because there was no regulatory framework in India
for determining the potential fees for the use of satellite spectrum for terrestrial networks
in period 2008 to 2011”) and Harman ER2, paras 2.11 (“[T]here was uncertainty around

161. It is of course true that the Government may have viewed the proposed Devas

services with a positive eye, for instance because it may have considered that
they would benefit rural communities. However, it is unlikely that this factor alone
would have led the Government to charge no meaningful fees for the terrestrial
reuse of the spectrum. Indeed, it should not be overlooked that any public interest
benefit that the Devas services may have brought would have been balanced
against other public interest objectives, including the need to avoid distortion to
competition and the Government's legitimate decision to subject the use of a
scarce resource to the payment of consideration. And it barely needs mentioning
that, in and of itself, a decision to condition the territorial reuse of the spectrum to
a payment could not constitute a violation of the Treaty.

162. In light of the novelty of the licensing issues and the lack of a specific regulatory

framework, the Tribunal cannot determine the precise level of the fee that the
Government would have charged for the issuance of the WPC License. Yet, it
need not do so for the purpose of this analysis. For the present valuation exercise,
it is sufficient to conclude, based on the evidence, that “the level of the terrestrial
re-use license fee was highly uncertain”, to use the Claimant's expert's words,?9
and that it was reasonably conceivable that the WPC License may have been
granted on more onerous terms than those Devas/DT would have expected. As
for the grant of the license, the uncertainty about the fee level is not decisive as
will be further elaborated below.

(iv) Conclusion

163. In sum, on the Valuation Date there was an element of uncertainty as to (i) the

209

principle of the WPC License being granted to Devas and (ii) the amount of the
fee payable for such grant. This conclusion does not mean that Devas was worth
zero on the Valuation Date, as the Respondent contends. Rather, the Tribunal
must adopt a valuation methodology which takes account of the specific
circumstances of this case and the evidence on valuation in the record, without
disregarding the level of uncertainty on the licencing issues. In other words, such
uncertainty is but one of the elements which the Tribunal may consider in

See Harman ER2, para. 4.33 (Dr Flores considers that there is no uncertainty as to the
level of the terrestrial re-use licence fee. | consider that the level of terrestrial re-use
licence fee was highly uncertain, for the following reasons”).

selecting the valuation methodology that, based on the evidence in the record,
provides the most appropriate “basis upon which the Tribunal can, with
reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss”.2'°

THE VALUATION METHODS PROPOSED BY THE PARTIES

With the foregoing considerations in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the valuation
methodologies proposed by the Parties. The Claimant has proposed the DCF
method (infra at V.B.1) and the so-called “Investment Plus” methodology (infra at
V.B.2). The Respondent, while maintaining its position that no damages should
be awarded, has alternatively suggested that the only approach that is
conceivably appropriate for this case is the sunk costs method (infra at V.B.3).

The Discounted Cash Flow Method
a. The Claimant’s position
(i) The appropriateness of the DCF method

The Claimant submits that the most appropriate valuation method to determine
the FMV of DT’s investment in Devas is DCF.?'' It explains that DCF is the
method “which ‘businessmen and financiers apply every day in deciding how
much to invest in a business’”.?'? It is thus the method that a willing buyer would
use to determine the value of DT’s investment in Devas,?"? and the only method
which will ensure that DT receives full reparation for the loss it has suffered as a
consequence of India’s unlawful conduct.?"4

The Claimant explains that the DCF method is the most appropriate in the present
case for a number reasons:

. It is a valid method for evaluating start-up businesses, particularly
where it is necessary to adjust for certain risks such as the licensing
risks present in this case;

. It is well-established for the valuation of businesses in the
telecommunications sector generally and within DT more
particularly;2"®

. DT has applied the DCF method in 2008 and 2009 in the ordinary
course of business, when it made its investment in Devas;?'7

. In February 2011, it was a requirement of India’s currency laws that a
foreign buyer purchasing shares in an unlisted company, such as
Devas, value the company using the DCF method;?"8

. Devas’s primary asset, i.e. its right to lease the spectrum under the
Agreement, was an income-producing asset and DCF is the only
reliable method of assessing such an asset, as any other method would
dramatically undervalue the asset;

. Arbitral tribunals have endorsed the use of the DCF method for the
purposes of valuing a telecommunications company, even when the
company was not a going concern. DT points in particular to the
decision in Rumeli v Kazakhstan;?'9 and

. It is a well-established principle “that the FMV of an asset must be
assessed by reference to its ‘highest and best use””.22°

DT concedes that “substantial investment arbitration jurisprudence exists, which
suggests a general — but largely historical and increasingly debated - reservation

on the part of tribunals with respect to the use of income-based approaches such
as DCF to value companies without an established history of profitability”.22"

168. In this regard, the Claimant contends that the absence of a track record of

profitability does not automatically render the use of the DCF method overly
speculative, if the investor can prove that the investment would have generated
the profits claimed.? In this regard, the Claimant cites to Vivendi II, which held
that:
“a claimant might be able to establish the likelihood of lost profits with sufficient
certainty even in the absence of a genuine going concern” by “presenting

sufficient evidence of its expertise and proven record of profitability of
[businesses] it (or indeed others) had operated in similar circumstances.”275

 

169. In response to the authorities relied upon by India, DT submits that a “proper

review” of those authorities confirms that the DCF was rejected on grounds
specific to those cases.” It is therefore not particularly instructive to look at the
decisions of other tribunals as these necessarily involved different facts and
evidence.”

170. While it is of course true, admits DT, that Devas had no operating history, such

fact should not result in the conclusion that its business was too speculative or
uncertain, because India’s “unlawful conduct prevented it from ever reaching the
point of rolling out its network and services”.226

171. For the Claimant, the following additional evidence should lead the Tribunal to

developed hand held terminals and devices, performed experimental
trials, developed societal applications, and prepared the WPC License
application;228

. Even though no other company had a track record of operating similar
services in India, the BWA services that Devas was to offer were the
“bread and butter” of DT, and for the AV services, Devas benefitted
from some of the world’s foremost experts in hybrid satellite-terrestrial
systems. Moreover, such services and businesses were “well known
to Devas and DT” outside of India;229

. The “Darwin Model”, i.e. the most up to date version of DT’s business
plan developed with Devas in September 2009, “which FTI has taken
as the starting point for its valuation”, was developed in the ordinary
course of business, not in the context of a dispute, and contained
robust assumptions in relation to the Devas business;?°°

. DT rebuts India’s argument that its valuations played no role in the
price it paid for its shares in Devas by stating that its contemporaneous
valuations set a theoretical “ceiling” on the price DT would have paid
for a business like Devas. The fact that DT was ultimately able to
negotiate the price down does not affect its “real-time” view of the value
of Devas;?3

. Contrary to India’s allegations, the fact that DT’s 2008 financial
statements did not include the cash flow forecasts set out in the 2008
business plan, does not mean that DT considered those cash flows
unreliable. Valuations performed for accounting purposes are not the
same as valuations prepared for the purposes of corporate

transactions,?°? and “the accounting team would not have reviewed
Devas’s cash flows”.?°9

172. Finally, while the Claimant acknowledges that the ICC tribunal declined to apply

the DCF method because Devas had no track record of operations, the ICC
tribunal held that DCF may be the appropriate method “if there is a reliable,
alternative guide to what the future earnings of the business are likely to be”.254
DT submits that, in this arbitration, by contrast to the ICC Arbitration, “DT is
uniquely placed to give this Tribunal, with the support of its fact and expert
witnesses, precisely the requisite confidence that the ICC Tribunal considered
that it lacked”.295

(ii) The 2010 BWA Spectrum Auction as a benchmark for Devas’s
value

173. As an alternative market data point to its DCF analyses, FT| has compared the

2010 BWA Spectrum Auction against the Devas spectrum.?° The price paid for
20 MHz of spectrum in the context of the 2010 BWA Spectrum Auction was
USD 2.75 billion (or USD 4.13 billion for 30 MHz), and FTI’s DCF value for Devas
(with no license fee) amounts to USD 2.63 billion.25”

174. This comparison, so says DT, demonstrates that FTI’s DCF analysis is

232

conservative.”*° According to DT, India accepts the relevance of this cross-check
because it uses the 2010 BWA Spectrum Auction for the purposes of its
arguments in relation to the WPC License fee.”°° DT also considered the auction
price an appropriate benchmark of value at the time, as it compared the value of

the Devas spectrum with the reserve price of the (then) upcoming auction, as
USD 860 million, as was noted in its Management Board papers in 2009.74°

(iii) Reasonableness of FTI’s DCF Assumptions

Based on its DCF analysis, FTI has calculated that the FMV of Devas as of the
Valuation Date was USD 1.618 billion. It then determined the value of DT’s
investment in light of its 19.62% shareholding in Devas, which comes to USD 270
million accounting for a minority discount.

According to DT, the assumptions which FTI adopted to arrive at its DCF analysis
are entirely reasonable. FTI has taken the Darwin Model and has made
appropriate adjustments both up and down. By contrast, so says DT, Dr. Flores
has manipulated FTI’s model with the sole aim of reducing the adjustments in
order to achieve a value of zero.*' In response to Dr. Flores’ value-reducing
adjustments, DT makes the following submissions.

First, FTI has priced the risk of the reuse licenses and associated fees into its
DCF calculation by using three possible licensing outcomes, i.e. (i) no or nominal
fees; (ii) medium level of fees; and (iii) fees based on the 2010 BWA Spectrum
Auction, and then “assigned an equal one-third probability for the outcome of
each of these scenarios”. Dr. Flores’s assumption that the WPC Licensing fee
would be so high that it would bankrupt Devas?*? is untenable.244

Second, India’s contention that FTI failed to incorporate a build-out requirement
based on the BWA Spectrum Auction is deeply flawed because the BWA would
not have been the reference point adopted by a willing buyer, and any such build-
out requirement would in any event not have been applied,?45 not least because

“the cost of a terrestrial build-out requirement into non-urban areas would not
have applied to Devas”.246

Third, India’s assertion that the assumptions concerning the bandwidth demand
needed to be adjusted is further erroneous. India, according to DT, has also
overstated the costs of doing so.747

Fourth, the Respondent's argument that the FTI Model failed to account for the
time when Devas could have launched its TD-LTE technology services is
irrelevant, because “neither the Darwin Model nor the FTI Model envisaged rolling
out BWA to paying customers as part of the May 2011 Bangalore launch”.248
Consequently, no adjustment ought to be made to the model in this respect.

Fifth, there is no need to take into account an increase in download speeds from
January 2015 to meet the TRAI 2010 recommendations. In any event, the
“negative impact on value of increasing bandwidth speeds in this way would be
considerably less than the [USD 1.3 billion reduction] suggested by Dr. Flores”.249
Similarly, Dr. Sharony’s expert evidence that FTI “made incorrect bandwidth
capacity assumptions in its modelling exercise” and criticisms in relation to
spectral efficiency assumptions, were proved incorrect at the Hearing.7©°

Sixth, India has placed an unreasonable amount of emphasis on Devas not being
able to provide mobile telephony.2*' There is no data to support Dr. Flores’
significant valuation decrease.

Seventh, Dr. Flores’s criticism of FTI for assuming an extension of the project
beyond the duration of 12 years, renewable once, is misplaced. FTI correctly
assumed that the Agreement would be extended beyond 24 years, but accounted
for any uncertainty of an extension in the discount rate.?52

Finally, Dr. Flores’s calculation of the applicable discount rate as 31% is flawed
as it double counts risk already included in the cash flows; reflects an internal rate
of return (“IRR”), not a discount rate; and is unsuitable when compared to the
discount rate applied in DT’s own DCF valuation (i.e. 20%).5° The appropriate
rate, according to DT, is Mr. Harman’s rate of 19% which accounts for a “bottom-
up and top-down approach, and factoring in the mitigation in risk between 2008
and the Valuation Date, as well as the fact that the global financial crisis had
abated”.254

b. The Respondent's position
(i) The DCF method is inappropriate

The Respondent submits that the use of a DCF valuation method is “wholly
inappropriate” in this case.255 A DCF valuation demands a degree of certainty as
to future cash flows and profits,25° which did not exist here. Devas was not a going
concern with a proven record of profitability, but a highly “speculative start-up”.257

For India, the authorities are “virtually unanimous’ in their conclusion that DCF is
inappropriate in circumstances such as the present ones.° Notably, the World
Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, the ILC Articles
Commentary, as well as a number of authorities and investment treaty awards,
have rejected the use of the DCF method to value assets that lacked an
established record of profits, on the ground that the contrary approach would

result in speculative valuations.©° India further underscores that the ICC tribunal
also discarded the DCF method.?6

187. It is the Respondent’s submission that the decisions relied upon by DT in support

of its argument that the DCF method was applied in other disputes involving the
telecommunications industry, even when the company was not a going concern,
are all inapposite based on the particular facts of those cases.”*' Those decisions
reinforce the point that there is “no precedent of a tribunal using DCF under these
circumstances, or anything remotely resembling them, absent agreement of the
parties” .262

188. In the present circumstances, using a DCF calculation would be inappropriate,

so the Respondent asserts, because the (i) infrastructure needed for the
proposed Devas business had not been built; (ii) Devas had no customers, and
was yet to generate any revenue; (ili) the competitive, technological and
commercial risks were high; (iv) the projected cash flows were “highly speculative
and extremely sensitive to slight variations in assumptions”; (v) “the business
would not turn cash positive until its eighth year” of operation; (vi) Devas was yet
to obtain the most important licenses; and (vii) absent a change in India’s
regulatory policy, the license fees would have made Devas unviable. 76°

valuable satellite spectrum’ under the Agreement, was an income-
producing asset”;264

. DT’s reliance on its DCF computations in 2008 and 2009 is
misconceived, as those valuations played no apparent role in setting
the price for the acquisition of the Devas shares,?© nor were they
updated to reflect fundamental changes in the market by the time of
the Valuation Date;26°

. DT admitted in its own 2008 Annual Report that it “did not measure the
investments by discounting the expected cash flows because the cash
flows could not be reliably determined”.2°” Even if, as the Claimant
asserts, there is a difference between the valuation method used for
corporate as opposed to accounting purposes, that does not explain
why the cash flows could not be reliably determined, or how the
language used “does not in fact reflect an opinion on the Devas cash
flows”.268

(ii) 2010 BWA Spectrum Auction as a benchmark for Devas’s
value

190. For the Respondent, the 2010 BWA Spectrum Auction is irrelevant to the FMV of

Devas. The auction price merely indicates the fee to be paid to the Government
for the use of India’s scarce spectrum resource. That fee would need to be paid
on top of the purchase price for Devas.

191. In any event, the fact that another company was prepared to pay USD 2.74 billion

for 20 MHz of spectrum to operate a terrestrial BWA business does not show that

based on the assumption that Devas would be granted the use of 30 MHz of
satellite spectrum for a terrestrial BWA business at no cost.?”°

(iii) Value-reducing adjustments

192. According to the Respondent, even assuming that Devas would have received

all the necessary licenses at a reasonable cost and a DCF valuation would be
suitable in the circumstances, the value of the Devas business would still be
below zero based on reasonable assumptions.2”!

193. First, the Respondent highlights the fact that the FT| valuation does not include

roll-out obligation costs and refutes the Claimant's position that Devas would not
be required to incur such costs when these applied to every operator providing
BWA services.?72

194. Second, the FTI valuation does not account for the increase of the download

minimum broadband speeds recommended by the TRAI and therefore for the
broadband speeds applicable after January 2015. This failure artificially
augments Devas's value by USD 1.3 billion.2”3

195. Third, India submits that technological change in the telecommunications sector

would require Devas to switch to LTE technology. This would entail further costs
for which FTI did not account.2”

196. Fourth, the Respondent asserts that the 19% discount rate used by the Claimant

270

272

273

274

275

is speculative and does not accord with the discount rate applied to a start-up.
According to the literature, the average discount rate for a start-up such as Devas
is in the order of 30-70% and Dr. Flores has set the correct rate here at 31%.275

DCF computations did not consider licensing risk, as was confirmed at the
Hearing by Mr. Axmann, the Vice President of DT’s Mergers & Acquisition team
and then project manager in charge of evaluating the Devas investment
opportunity .2”6

c. Analysis

197. The Tribunal first addresses whether the use of the DCF method is appropriate

under the circumstances of this case (infra at V.B.1.c(i)). Only if it were to give an
affirmative answer to this question would the Tribunal have to assess whether
any adjustments are warranted in respect of the DCF valuation presented by the
Claimant's expert (infra at V.B.1.c(ii)).

(i) Is the use of DCF appropriate in this case?

198. The DCF method is an accepted valuation method in both financial theory and in

practice, including by arbitral tribunals. It typically involves a two-step process, as
outlined by the tribunal in Amoco International Finance v. Iran:

“The first step in valuing an asset pursuant to the DCF method must be to
project from the valuation date onward the most likely revenues and expenses
of the ongoing concern, year by year. The revenues less the expenses will
give the future cash flow. The second step will be to discount the projected
net cash flow to its ‘present value’ as of the valuation date.”?””

199. The Tribunal considers that a DCF valuation may be suited to assess the FMV of

276

277

278

a going concern with a proven record of profitability, as confirmed by the World
Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment.?’”° A “going
concern” is defined by these Guidelines as “an enterprise consisting of income-
producing assets which has been in operation for a sufficient period of time to
generate the data required for the calculation of future income and which could

have been expected with reasonable certainty, if the taking had not occurred, to
continue producing legitimate income over the course of its economic life in the
general circumstances following the taking by the State”.?”9

200. By contrast, as confirmed by a consistent line of cases, DCF is generally

inappropriate if the company is not a going concern and lacks an established
record of profitability. The tribunal in Metalclad v. Mexico, for instance,
distinguished the two situations in the following way:

“Normally, the fair market value of a going concern which has a history of
profitable operation may be based on an estimate of future profits subject to a
discounted cash flow analysis.

However, where the enterprise has not operated for sufficiently long time to
establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future
profits cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value. [...]

The Tribunal agrees with Mexico that a discounted cash flow analysis is

inappropriate in the present case because the landfill was never operative and
any award based on future profits would be wholly speculative.”?°°

pronounced in cases [...] where the business is still in its relatively early
development phase and has no trading history at all”.28° In some of these cases,
even where the production or business activity had already started, tribunals
nonetheless declined to award damages based on forecasts of future cash flows
on the ground that the track record was deemed insufficiently reliable.8” The
Tribunal agrees with this well-established line of cases and considers that this
jurisprudential trend is not, contrary to what the Claimant appears to suggest,
outdated, but includes several recent examples, such as Caratube v.
Kazakhstan?® or South American Silver v. Bolivia.?®9

202. In this Tribunal’s view, there are good reasons for not applying DCF to valuation

of assets or companies that have no track record of profitability. The absence of
such a record makes the estimates regarding future revenues more prone to
speculations and dependent on uncertain assumptions.2° The caution that
tribunals display towards DCF in those circumstances “reflects a justified

been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements.
When compared with tangible assets, profits (and intangible assets which are income-
based) are relatively vulnerable to commercial and political risks, and increasingly so the
further into the future projections are made. In cases where lost future profits have been
awarded, it has been where an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient
attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to be
compensable. This has normally been achieved by virtue of contractual arrangements or,
in some cases, a well-established history of dealings”).

reluctance [...] to get involved in what are essentially competing prophecies of
often equal plausibility”.29"

203. With those principles in mind, the Tribunal considers whether DCF would be

appropriate in light of the reality of the Devas business. It is common ground that
Devas was not a going concern. Its proposed business had not started, it lacked
any customers, its cost levels were untested, and it had not yet generated any
revenues. It thus had no track record of profitability whatsoever. In the Tribunal’s
view, these facts would suffice in and of themselves to discard DCF as an
appropriate valuation methodology. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that
Devas lacked the WPC License,”°? the issuance of which was uncertain on the
Valuation Date (see supra section V.A.3.b), as was the level of the related fee.

204. The Tribunal considers that, given these facts, future expected profits could not

be established with the required degree of certainty, as projections would be
subject to many possibilities and hypotheses and, therefore, turn out to be
speculative.

205. The Tribunal observes that the difficulty to determine Devas’s future cash flows

292

was acknowledged in DT’s financial statements of 2008, with the following
comment:

“At the balance sheet date, T-Mobile Venture Fund GmbH & Co. KG and
Deutsche Telekom Asia Pte Ltd were recognized at cost. No market prices
were available for the investments. Neither was it possible to derive the
respective fair value in the period in question using comparable transactions.

Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law 1049 (P. Muchlinski et al. eds., Oxford
University Press 2008), Exh. RLA-189, p. 1076.

The lack of the WPC License distinguishes this case from Rumeli, a case invoked by the
Claimant. In Rumeli, the tribunal concluded that the DCF method should be applied
because there was “no realistic alternative” in order to ascertain the FMV of the asset,
Kazakhstan having proposed the liquidation value as an alternative approach. See
Rumeli, Exh. CLA-056, para. 811. The company’s key asset in that case was a license
to operate a mobile network, which had been awarded upon the company’s successful
bid at an auction. Following the award of the license, the relevant investment contract
was negotiated and entered into. See /d., paras. 86-87. In the ad hoc committee’s
decision, the tribunal held that DCF was applicable because the company “had at that
stage a major asset of considerable value”, namely, the operating license. See Rumeli
Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v. Republic of
Kazakhstan, Decision of the ad hoc Committee, 25 March 2010, Exh. CLA-189, para.
179(2). In this case, while Devas did have rights to the spectrum, it had not yet obtained
the WPC License which was, as this Tribunal previously found, critical to the roll out and
ultimate profitability of the Devas system, and was uncertain.

inapposite in the decision of the ICC Tribunal in Devas v. Antrix, which viewed
the DCF methodology presented by Devas as “an unrealistic and unreliable

vehicle for determining its damages”:

“[T]he demand for Devas’ services is unclear; the prices that it would be able
to profitably charge is unclear; market(s) for multimedia broadcasting services
can be highly innovative and cause (even very profitable) products and
services to quickly become obsolete; and there is persuasive evidence [...]
that Devas faced significant competition for the services that it proposed to
provide. In other words, there is nothing that can give the tribunal sufficient
confidence about the cash flows that Devas would have [...]. Further, an
aspect of the DCF methodology that the tribunal finds particularly troubling in
this case is that small variations in the assumptions used in the DCF
methodology can dramatically and unrealistically change Devas’ value [...]
The tribunal understands that the reason for the extreme sensitivity of the DCF
methodology in this case is the length of the period that it would take for Devas
to become cash flow positive (nine years). In this case, in the tribunal's view,
it makes Devas’ DCF methodology an unrealistic and unreliable vehicle for
determining its damages.”2%*

would have”, the Tribunal is unconvinced by the other elements adduced by DT
in support of its proposed DCF valuation. This is particularly the case for the so-
called “real world” DCF valuations that DT carried out when it decided to invest
in Devas. These valuations ultimately played no apparent role when DT finally
acquired its indirect shareholding in Devas. For example, DT’s first valuation
performed by Mr. Scheuermann, based on the cash flows in the Series-C Model
(with DT’s adjustment to the terminal growth rate), yielded a value of
USD 1.78 billion for 100% of Devas using a 20% discount rate. By contrast,
the price DT Asia actually paid for the shares was based on a value of

relatively early stage of the project lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that the
DCF method cannot form the basis for the quantification of the Claimant's
damages. This conclusion takes into account but does not view as determinative
the uncertainty regarding the WPC license which would have been necessary to
roll out the proposed services and, therefore, generate profits. Accordingly, the
Tribunal discards the DCF valuation put forward by FTI which, in light of the
objective factors just mentioned, would be subject to excessive uncertainties,
contingencies and hypotheses, and would not provide “a basis upon which the

Tribunal [could], with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss”.29”

DT’s Investment Plus method is built on the following three steps:

a. Ittakes as a starting point DT’s March 2008 cash payment of USD 75 million
for its investment in Devas, which is said to imply a valuation of USD 375
million for Devas at that time;

b. It adjusts that amount to reflect Devas’s FMV by factoring in DT’s in-kind
contributions and bargaining power; and

c. It adds an uplift fee to reflect the progress made in developing the business
between March 2008 and the Valuation Date.°°

(i) The March 2008 value of Devas should be adjusted to account
for DT’s bargaining power and in-kind contributions
It is DT’s contention that while it valued Devas in early 2008 at USD 1.78 billion,
it was able to negotiate a substantially lower price of USD 75 million for a 20%
interest, which implies a value for Devas of USD 375 million.

According to DT, in 2008, the price which DT eventually paid was reduced as
compared to its DCF valuation due to the following four factors:3°'

a. The risks associated with investing in Devas, including the WPC Licensing
uncertainty ;5°2

b. DT’s negotiating power and leverage due to (i) the significantly lower price
paid by the two venture capital funds, which acquired shares in Devas in
March 2006 and 2007; (ii) the fact that Devas had relatively limited funding
needs prior to the satellite launch; (iii) DT’s assumption that it was the only
interested investor offering Devas strategic benefits; (iv) DT’s knowledge
that, should Devas be required to search for an alternative investor, it
would have incurred substantial delays;3° and (v) the fact that Devas was
under a compulsion to sell due to its need to secure a strategic investor
by early 2008 in order to ensure the roll out of the business;3%

c. DT’s in-kind contribution, including the fact that Devas was a strategic
investor bringing “technical expertise and considerable procurement
leverage”.°°5 The Claimant contends that Devas would not have accepted
an investment on the same monetary terms from another investor.°° This
argument is supported by the fact that from March 2008 Devas did indeed
benefit from DT’s operational and technical expertise as well as “sourcing
and procurement support [...] [of] network equipment at a considerably
lower cost”;3°” and

d. DT’s concerns about its rights as a minority shareholder, particularly
considering the potential for diverging interests between itself as a

In response to India’s arguments that the USD 75 million paid by DT in 2008 did
not imply a value of USD 375 million, DT makes the following submissions:

a. The fact that DT held Class C priority shares does not mean that its
investment in Devas in 2008 cannot be used as a starting point for
Devas’s value. While Devas had five classes of shares, DT assumed that
there was no economic value in Class E shares and that Class D shares
had the same economic value as Class A, B and C shares. On that basis,
it considered its 17% of issued share capital was equivalent to a 20%
economic stake in Devas;3"!

b. DT did not seek to protect itself from licensing risks by way of
representations and warranties.*'? India’s arguments in this regard
misunderstand and magnify certain comments found in documents. If DT
sought such representation and warranties, they would appear in the 2008
and 2009 Share Subscription Agreements or in the papers presented to
the DT’s Management or Supervisory Boards in 2008 and 2009;3'3

c. India’s reliance on the fact that one of the claimants in the Mauritius
Shareholders Arbitration paid only USD 146 per share to acquire its
ordinary shares in September 2009 is similarly unfounded. That purchase
was made through Devas Employees Mauritius Private Limited
(‘DEMPL’), a “vehicle by which Devas management and other employees
could acquire shares in Devas as part of their compensation and rewards
package pursuant to an Equity Incentive Plan”.3'4 The share price for that
transaction is not relevant to DT’s investment in Devas.°"5

DT further rebuts Dr. Flores’ criticism that the weightings which FTI assigned to
DT’s negotiating power and in-kind contribution were arbitrary. The Claimant
explains that the percentages used by FTI were taken from Mr. Axmann’s
evidence which provides the relative weight of these variables, as well as from

FTI’s assessment on reasonable weighting.>"® The values adopted by FTI for the

bargaining power and in-kind contribution are conservative and supported by the

following facts:

a. Devas’s initial proposal for the sale of the shares implied a pro rata value

of USD 800 million, whereas the price paid by DT implies a pro rata value
of USD 375 million. This demonstrates that, using its “take-it-or-leave-it”
approach (among other things), DT was able to achieve a reduction of
USD 425 million, which is in fact more than the USD 370 million FTI has
attributed to bargaining power;3"” and

Based on the DCF model used by DT for the initial investment (i.e. the
Series C 2008 Model) “DT’s support and procurement power would only
have needed to reduce Devas’s expected operating and capital costs by
circa 2.9% to increase Devas’s value by USD 221 million’,'® a fact
confirmed by Dr. Larsen.*'? In this regard, India’s reliance on the evidence
of Mr. Scheuermann and the allegation that the “in-kind” contribution was
not recorded in any of the contemporaneous Board papers or documents
is both incorrect and misplaced.°° This is because:

= Mr. Scheuermann’s role was to conduct DCF valuations, whereas
Dr. Larsen was “responsible for the in-kind element of the
investment” and Mr. Axmann “carried out that price negotiation”.°71
Moreover, Mr. Scheuermann’s evidence concerning DT’s practice
of accounting for in-kind contributions by a “synergy calculation
spreadsheet”, is confined to calculations “between two
established telecom companies” .222

According to DT, a number of developments increased the FMV of DT’s

For those reasons, FTI has increased its calculation of FMV by 50% “to reflect

332

333

334

335

b. Increasing the value of Devas by adding the uplift applied by the ICC
Tribunal in absolute terms only (i.e. 50% of USD 375 million = USD
187.5million) to account for the fact that “it is impossible to determine
whether the [ICC] Tribunal had a relative or absolute increase in mind
when it effected a 50% uplift”.2°°

Applying these alternatives, FTI calculates the FMV accounting for the increase
in value for these two alternative scenarios between USD 1.154 billion and
USD 1.449 billion. These figures yield an FMV for DT’s stake in Devas between
USD 207 million and USD 284 million.2*1

In response to India’s allegation that the value of Devas decreased rather than
increased by the Valuation Date, DT advances the following arguments:

a. The fact that DT paid the same price for its shares in 2008 and 2009 is
not indicative of a decrease in Devas’s value. The reason why the price
was identical is “primarily as a result of the global financial crisis”.°°* In
fact, contrary to India’s view, DT’s willingness to pay the same price
despite the financial crisis demonstrates that Devas had increased in
value;333

b. There is no evidence suggesting an increase in risk concerning the WPGC
License.**4 This is buttressed by the fact that the ICC Tribunal concluded
that the lack of WPC License had no adverse impact on the value of
Devas;335

Memorial, para. 288(b). As noted by Mr. Harman, “[t]he ICC Tribunal found that the value
of Devas had increased by 50% from USD 375m to USD 562.5m. This is equivalent to
an absolute increase of USD 187.5m. Whereas the ICC Tribunal referred to its increase
in percentage terms (i.e. a relative approach), it is not possible for me to determine
whether in fact the ICC Tribunal had an absolute increase in mind when it uplifted the
value. Consequently, in this alternative scenario, | only uplift my calculation of FMV by
USD 187.5m to reflect developments and the lowering of risk up to the Valuation Date.”

c.

The reliance which India places on the 2010 BWA Spectrum Auction as
evidence of increased WPC License risk is misplaced. The evidence
demonstrates that “the high prices likely to be paid in the BWA auction
were value-enhancing, since they were viewed as a proxy for the value of
the spectrum rights owned by Devas, not the cost of the WPC License”;39°

Dr. Flores is wrong to suggest that satellite risks increased prior to the
Valuation Date. Progress was made on constructing the satellites and
Devas considered alternate launch vehicles. The slow roll-out of the first
launch should be disregarded on the basis that by July 2010 India had
decided to annul the Devas Agreement;3°” and

Prior to the Valuation Date, there were favorable technological and
economic developments that reduced risks inherent in the project, such
as development in TD-LTE for the roll out of Devas’s BWA business, and
improvements in macroeconomic factors.*°°

b. The Respondent's position

The Respondent submits that the Investment Plus method is not based on

economics but is constructed by the Claimant in order to achieve a pre-

determined result that is otherwise unachievable applying orthodox economic

theory.%°9 India further asserts that such method is unsustainable as it is based

on three manifestly incorrect premises. A correct assessment of the evidence

leads to the conclusion that:

a.

DT invested USD 75 million in preferential shares and on the basis of
representations and warranties of Devas. It is therefore wrong to
conclude that Devas’s value was at least USD 375 million in 2008;

The USD 600 million uplift for in-kind contributions and bargaining
power is unjustified;

c. The further upward adjustment of USD 483 million on the ground that
the value of the Devas business increased from 2008 to 2011 is also
untenable.*4°

(i) DT acquired priority shares in Devas

225. It is the Respondent's contention that DT’s starting point for the application of the

Investment Plus method (i.e. the implied value of Devas is USD 375 million based
on DT’s 2008 acquisition of its 20% share in Devas for USD 75 million) is
untenable. The reason is that it ignores that DT acquired preferential shares that
entitled it to receive the purchase price plus dividends in case of Devas's
liquidation or sale. These rights were reflected in the Term Sheet, which served
as the basis for the 2008 acquisition, and the 2008 Subscription Agreement, and
were confirmed by Mr. Parson at the hearing in the Mauritius Shareholders
Arbitration.6“" As Dr. Flores explains by reference to academic writing,*“ it is
inappropriate to value a business by reference to an ownership percentage if the
company has different classes of shares some of which have preferential
terms.348

226. Moreover, according to India, Devas gave express assurances to DT in the form

340

342

343

344

345

of representations and warranties that the “use of spectrum, including its
terrestrial use, is the sole responsibility of ISRO”.5*4 This is expressly made clear
in responses given by DT to questions from the German Government, as well as
the Term Sheet.45

227. As a result, according to the Respondent, the value of Devas is overstated. A

calculation on the basis of the value of ordinary shares would result in a value of
USD 27 million, calculated by reference to the price of USD 146 per unit paid by
one of the claimants in the Mauritius Shareholders Arbitration in
September 2009.54¢

(ii) The uplift for DT’s bargaining power and in-kind contributions
is frivolous

228. It is India’s submission that, contrary to DT’s allegations, Devas was not under a

“compulsion to sell” in 2008. As shown in Devas’s and DT’s internal documents,
there were other potential strategic partners interested in Devas, in the event that
DT had not invested in it. The deal offered by DT was the best deal available to
Devas, not the only one.*47

229. In relation to DT’s in-kind contributions, India argues that there is no evidence to

support the argument that the deal factored an in-kind contribution.“® The
documents show that the share acquisition was a “100% cash deal”.549
Mr. Scheuermann’s testimony confirmed that in-kind contributions played no role
in DT’s acquisition of Devas shares.*°° This point is further buttressed by the fact
that, when Mr. Larsen worked over the DCF model with Mr. Scheuermann for
internal purposes, costs were increased rather than decreased to account for
DT's expertise.35'

230. According to the Respondent, as confirmed by the documents on record, the price

that DT paid in 2008 and 2009 was attributable to the licensing risk inherent in
the Devas project, which was at the forefront of DT’s mind.*5?

231. For the Respondent, the weight of the 2008 adjustments is based solely on the

instructions of counsel, rather than on any economic analysis. Neither are the
relative weights of the adjustments derived from the witness statement of Mr.
Axmann.353

(iii) The upward adjustment based on a supposed increase in
Devas’s value after 2008 is baseless

232. It is India’s submission that there is no basis for the upward adjustment of

362

363

364

USD 483 million, which assumes that the value of Devas increased by 50%
between 2008 to 2011. To the contrary, a hypothetical buyer looking to purchase
the investment on the Valuation Date would have considered that the value of the
business had decreased given the events in that period:

a. Following the BWA Auctions, as part of its due diligence, a hypothetical
buyer would have sought clarification from the regulator and would have
been informed that there was no existing licensing regime permitting
Devas to provide the services envisaged. Similarly, the hypothetical buyer
would have been advised that “even if the required licenses had been
issued, Devas would have had to pay fees commensurate with the 2010
auction values, as reflected in the July 2010 letters written by the highest
officers of the DOT and WPC”;354

b. A hypothetical willing buyer would have been alerted by delays in
launching the GSAT-6 satellite, which is supported by Devas’s concern

about increasing delays.**> Contrary to the Claimant’s arguments there is
simply no evidence that the launch was deliberately “slow-rolled”.55°

c. Analysis

(i) Introductory remarks

233. In essence, FTI’s Investment Plus method starts from the assumption that, when

DT acquired the first tranche of its indirect shareholding in Devas in 2008, it
applied a discount to its own DCF valuation. FTI explains that it needs to add
back part of that discount in order to assess the FMV of the proposed Devas
business.

234. More specifically, FTI starts from the 2008 implied valuation of Devas of

USD 375 million, which is based on the pro rata price of USD 75 million paid by
DT for the acquisition of its 20% indirect shareholding. As a second step, it makes
a first upwards adjustment to account for DT’s alleged in-kind contributions and
bargaining power, which according to FTI lead to an increase of the Devas’s value
of USD 591 million. It thus reaches a value of Devas equal to USD 966 million
(USD 375 + 591 million). As a third step, it adds to that value a 50% uplift to
account for the alleged increase in value from 2008 to the Valuation Date, equal
to USD 483 million, reaching a figure of USD 1.449 billion. Based on these
figures, FTI concludes that DT’s 19.62% stake**” in Devas at the Valuation Date
was worth USD 284 million.

235. Before looking at the various components of the Investment Plus method, the

365

356

367

Tribunal notes that, unlike the DCF or sunk cost methods (on which see infra
section V.B.3.), the so-called Investment Plus approach does not appear to be
clearly grounded in economic theory. The Claimant's quantum expert himself
seemed ill-at-ease applying this valuation methodology because of its
subjectivity:

Rejoinder, para. 156, referring to the ICC Hearing Tr. Day 3, pp. 39, line 41 evidence of
Viswanathan as well as Mauritius Quantum Transcript, Exh. C-330, pp. 379-380.

Rejoinder, paras. 152-158.

This is DT’s stake in Devas at the Valuation Date following certain changes to Devas’s
shareholdering structure. See Memorial on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 119; Memorial,
para. 125.

“[T]here’s no economics behind the 50% [uplift applied by the ICC Tribunal];
itis a feel of the evidence. This is why | don’t like these approaches so much,
because it’s much more difficult than the DCF to try to quantify them
directly.”25°

Second, the Tribunal observes that FTI’s upwards adjustments are made by
reference to DT’s 2008 DCF valuation. In particular, FTI has sought to measure
the impact of DT’s alleged negotiating power and in-kind investments on the
difference between DT’s DCF valuation and the valuation implied in DT’s actual
2008 investment (which difference FTI has called the “2008 Adjustment”).559
Accordingly, the Investment Plus valuation is also based on a DCF-methodology,
albeit indirectly. This will lead the Tribunal to view the Investment Plus method
with caution, given the shortcomings linked to the use of a DCF methodology in
this particular case, as explained in the preceding section (see especially supra
section V.B.1.c).

Leaving aside these general reservations on the Investment Plus method, the
Tribunal examines now the specific components on which FTI’s valuation is built.
It starts with the two “upwards adjustments” that are factored into the valuation.
Depending on the outcome of its review on these two factors, the Tribunal may
either examine or dispense with analyzing the first element, i.e. whether it is
possible to extrapolate an enterprise value of USD 375 million based on DT Asia’s
2008 acquisition of the Devas’s shares.

(ii) The upwards adjustment for DT’s alleged _ in-kind
contributions and negotiating power
The Tribunal first considers step 2 of the Investment Plus method, i.e. FTI’s
upwards adjustment linked to DT’s alleged in-kind contributions (assessed by FTI
to be equal to approximately USD 222 million) and DT’s alleged bargaining power
vis-a-vis Devas (evaluated in excess of USD 369 million), both of which justify in
FTI’s view of an “uplift” of almost USD 600 million in Devas’s value.

Taking DT’s alleged in-kind contribution first, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant's
argument that in 2008 Devas was looking for a strategic investor. By then Devas

had already secured equity investments from Columbia Capital LLC and Telecom
Ventures LLC and, with limited funding needs, it was looking for an industry player

corresponding experience and expertise, was a strategic investor, and was
looking to invest in start-ups in emerging markets.°°' This being said, the Tribunal

between DT and Devas, which states:

“The Company has expressed an interest in finding a strategic investor who
would be prepared to provide funds by way of an equity contribution and know-

investment of US$ 150 million in the Company and supporting the Business
subject to the terms and conditions set out in this Term Sheet and in the

support. By contrast, it provides no detail about any envisaged in-kind
contribution, let alone ascribes any value attached to such contribution. To the
contrary, rather than showing that the “provision of know-how” was an “equity
contribution”, it shows that DT would provide services at arm’s length separate
agreements. Consistent with this statement, the 31 March 2010 board minutes
reflect that Devas was entering into two service agreements with DT, one for
procurement and one for the provision of services.°® In the Tribunal’s view,
providing services for compensation does not constitute in-kind equity
contributions.

At the Hearing, DT’s witness Mr. Scheuermann also explained that the difference
between his DCF valuation of Devas and the price DT ultimately resolved to pay
for the Devas shares “ha[d] nothing to do with the in-kind contributions”. As stated
by Mr. Scheuermann in response to a question of the Tribunal and with reference
to paragraph 9 of his witness statement (which is quoted further below):

“THE PRESIDENT: Can you look at paragraph 9 of your second witness

statement. We asked you before about the $40 million cash and how this
relates to the price actually paid and to in-kind contributions.

A. Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Is this the answer, or is it not, to the questions we've asked
you?

A. So | think this is in the direction of what is the difference between the DCF
valuation and the price which has been paid, yes? So ... And as | said in the
beginning, the DCF valuation was mandatory for the Deutsche Telekom
management board for each and every M&A transaction, and that is a kind of
a ceiling. So we set a ceiling for a valuation, and when the team then starts to
negotiate the deal, of course it must arrive at a better purchase price, yes? So
there needs to be a discrepancy in these two values, otherwise the deal would
not be approved, yes? So therefore, the bigger the discrepancy is, the better
it is at the end for Deutsche Telekom.

THE PRESIDENT: It is not only that it would not be approved; it is also that it
would probably make losses?

A. Exactly, yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Yes. So _that_has nothing to_do with the in-kind
contributions?

A. No.”365

Paragraph 9 of Mr. Scheuermann’s witness statement provides:

“India suggests that the disparity between my DCF valuation in 2008 and the
price DT ultimately paid for its investment in Devas demonstrates that DT did
not rely on my DCF valuation. | disagree. In my experience, where DT makes
an acquisition, the disparity between DT’s own internal valuation and the lower
price DT ultimately pays for that acquisition can vary considerably, but that
does not mean that our internal DCF valuations are not an important
consideration in making an investment decision. On the contrary, the DCF

valuation is the key valuation method and effectively determines a ‘ceiling
price for the particular project: the project team negotiating the ultimate
purchase price for the target entity has the goal of ensuring that purchase
price is less than the DCF value.”*”
Mr. Scheuermann further clarified during the Hearing that when DT makes an
acquisition involving some form of in-kind assistance, DT would value that
contribution as a synergy. However, these synergy calculations were not done in
this case:
“THE PRESIDENT: When you make an acquisition where you will provide
some kind of assistance to the company in which you take shares, how would

you account for these contributions? Is this something you would submit to
the board to approve, or how does this work?

A. So this is something what we calculate sometimes in the synergy
calculations, that we assume that as a kind of synergy and prepare this in a
synergy calculation spreadsheet, yes. But we haven't done that here in this
case.”368
The Tribunal further observes that there was no reference to an in-kind
contribution either in the contemporaneous documents leading to DT’s second
investment in Devas in 2009. To recall, in 2009, DT made a second acquisition
of shares in Devas, which was based on the same share price as its 2008
transaction. Mr. Axmann gave evidence that DT was able to maintain a lower
price, despite Devas’s alleged increase in value, because of the licensing risk
and because of the progress made which was “attributable to the in kind
contribution made by DT”.5°° However, neither the decision paper for DT’s
Management Board,°”° nor the submission to DT’s Supervisory Board in 2009°”'
record any in-kind contribution, which one would expect to find if the in-kind

contribution was as valuable as DT now alleges (over USD 221m according to

FTI).3”2 The submission to the Supervisory Board in particular emphasizes risks,

a point on which the Tribunal reverts below, and is silent on in-kind contributions:
“the planned capital increase in the third quarter of 2009 happens at a time

when various risks (eg satellite launch) have not yet been eliminated. On the
other hand this allows for a significant reduction in the valuation.

 

Since the following capital increase, based on current plans, is scheduled only
after the satellite launch and the start of the network expansion, the risk at that
point will be lower, with connected increases in the valuation. This results in
an appropriate risk allocation for DT between the first and second tranche.”

248. What is more, when it set forth the basis for the 2009 acquisition, DT stated that

this was a “100% cash deal”,°’* which again contradicts the Claimant's
assumption regarding the importance of non-monetary in-kind contributions.

249. Turning to the question of bargaining power, which is the second element in

step 2 of the Investment Plus method, the Claimant contends that “the only
rational explanation for Devas accepting DT’s reduced offer ‘was that DT had a
strong negotiating position because Devas needed a strategic partner at that time
and, at least in the short run, it had no obvious alternatives to DT”.°5 It is DT’s
further argument that because “Devas was under a compulsion to sell and DT
exercised considerable bargaining power”, “DT could — and did — pay a price that
was below FMV”.376

250. As already noted above (see supra para. 239), the Tribunal agrees with DT that

in 2008 Devas was looking for a strategic investor. It also accepts that, since
Devas was a start-up, DT may have had a notable bargaining power in the
negotiations with Devas. The Tribunal is, however, not convinced by DT’s
explanation that such bargaining power would have resulted in a discount of the
magnitude claimed by DT (almost USD 370 million based on Devas’s alleged
enterprise value).

First, unlike what the Claimant and its expert suggest, there is no evidence that
Devas was under any “compulsion to sell”.9’7 The International Valuation
Standards make clear that “without compulsion” means that “each party is
motivated to undertake the transaction, but neither is forced or unduly coerced to
complete it’.27® While Devas may have had a strong interest to attract investors
in order to undertake its business plan, there is nothing in the record to suggest
that it was “forced or unduly coerced” to complete the transaction with DT.
Moreover, Devas's internal documents show that at the time Devas was aware
of other “potential strategic partners”, including France Telecom, Sprint, Verizon,
and Vodafone.%”°

Hence, the existence of the main factors that allegedly served as “the only rational
explanation for Devas accepting DT’s reduced offer” have not been sufficiently
established, and neither has their impact on the discount to the extent DT claims.

In sum, apart from a few vague references in the contemporaneous documents,
the Tribunal cannot see any clear, much less convincing, evidence that DT’s
alleged in-kind contributions and its bargaining power resulted in the considerable
discount it asserts. This lack of evidence significantly impairs the Tribunal’s ability
to ascertain the value of DT’s investment on the methodologies advanced by the
Claimant.

In addition, the Tribunal has strong reservations on the reasonableness of the
“weightings” which FTI has applied to each of those factors. For instance, FTI has
considered that DT’s alleged negotiating power would account for 25% and DT’s
in-kind investment for 15% of the USD 1.478 billion “discount”, i.e. the difference
between DT’s DCF valuation and the implied valuation of USD 375 million, as
shown in the following table:

255. FTI has explained that these numerical weightings assigned to the various

components were based “on instruction of counsel”.*®° As a source for those
numerical weightings, the table also indicates paragraph 16 of Mr. Axmann’s third
witness statement. However, in that paragraph, Mr. Axmann merely states that:

“While it is difficult to assign a precise weight to each of these four categories
of factors, particularly more than a decade after these events took place, |
would estimate that the importance of each of these categories was roughly
in the order set out above, i.e. (i) the specific risks associated with Devas’s
business; (ii) the leverage that DT could apply; (iii) the value of DT’s in kind
contributions; and (iv) the minority nature of the stake to be acquired.”°*"

256. While in his expert reports Mr. Harman has sought to explain that these

weightings were “commensurate with the evidence and appear reasonable”,°°? at
the Hearing he acknowledged that “[t]here was no contemporaneous evidence at
the time as to what weight should be applied to each of those”.*85 In respect of
DT’s bargaining power, he added that “it’s a difficult calculation”.** In fact, these
percentages do not appear in any of the models prepared by Devas or DT at the

time. This being so, the Tribunal considers that the weightings assigned to the
components in the upwards adjustments in FTI’s Investment Plus valuation are
highly subjective and that FTI has not sufficiently explained the reasons
underlying the allocation of these percentages.

257. In conclusion, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the in-kind contributions and the

negotiating power played the role which DT seeks now to ascribe to them. Rather,
as already discussed in the context of its analysis on the licensing uncertainty
(see supra at V.A.3.b(ii)), the Tribunal is of the view that the contemporaneous
documents clarify that the “discount” effected by DT was mainly, if not entirely,
due to the risks that the project was facing.

258. For instance, the Briefing Note (Vorstandsvorlage) dated 5 March 2008, prepared

385

for the DT Management Board meeting of 11 March 2008, underscored that the
reduction in value compared to the DCF valuation was to “better reflect the
current risk price”:
“In connection with DT’s envisioned investment in Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd.
(“Devas”), the management board requested that the original proposal be
revisited to address the following points:
- Investment in instalments in order to gain additional comfort around the
underlying risks in the interim:
DT's committed investment is decreased from US$ 150m to US$ 75m
(resulting in a 20%-stake vs. 18.75% previously).

DT has the option to increase its stake to 30% by end-2009, allowing it to gain
higher comfort regarding regulatory risks. [...]

- Decrease in valuation for initial investment to better reflect the current risk
profile:

Renegotiations have lead [sic] to a decrease in (pre-money) valuation for the
initial investment from originally US$ 650m to US$ 300m.

Devas accepted such decrease due to the potential delay and risks of having
to re-start the process coupled with the irritation this might cause with its local
partner ISRO (‘Indian Space Research Organisation’).”2°5

Similarly, in response to questions from the State Secretary of the German
Ministry of Finance, the DT team responsible for the Devas deal also underlined
the risk element:

[...] it should be pointed out once again that it is in particular this tisk element
which serves as a justification for a significant valuation discount.**

In his first witness statement, Mr. Axmann also made it clear that DT had
proposed a reduction to the value due to the “overall assessment of the risk
factors”:

“Naturally, we recognised that there were risks associated with the project,
including the start-up nature of the company, the unclear regulatory regime
regarding the terrestrial re-use licence and the somewhat limited nature of
DT's corporate governance rights. In the case of the terrestrial re-use licence,
we noted that possible ways to address the lack of clarity were to: (a) revisit
the valuation of Devas; (b) require written confirmation from the WPC as a
condition to closing; or (c) commit to the investment in staged phases upon
certain regulatory milestones being met [...] In order to mitigate the various
risks we had identified, the Board directed that the amount of DT’s first-tranche
investment in Devas should be substantially decreasedf...] | understood from
Kevin that the Management Board’s decision was based on its overall
assessment of the risk factors (including the general risks associated with
entering a new market such as India) rather than any particular risk [...]
Following this meeting, we put forward to Devas our revised proposal for an
initial US$75 million investment in Devas for approximately 17% of the total
paid-up share capital of the company with potential further investment to be
made in staged phases. Devas’s management accepted DT’s proposal of a
staged investment with a reduced initial amount.”°”

In his third witness statement, Mr. Axmann further detailed the risks involved in
the acquisition as comprising the entry into a new market without established
record for the services planned; the start-up nature of the venture; and the
technical and regulatory risks. In his words:

“The final pre-money valuation of US$300 million implied by DT’s purchase

price was substantially lower than the US$1.8 billion enterprise value that DT

calculated as its internal valuation of the company. A number of factors explain

the difference between these two figures, which can be broadly allocated into
the following categories.

The first_and most significant of these factors was risk. As explained in my
First Witness Statement, | understand that the Management Board's direction
that the initial investment amount be reduced was influenced by its overall

assessment of various risk factors related to the Devas business. These risks
included (as identified in the papers put before the Board):

(a) General risks associated with entering a new market such as India, given
that there was ‘no well-established “track-record” of BWA, AV and VoIP-
services’ in the country at the time;

(b) Risk associated with Devas’s start-up nature, which meant that its
business plan was ‘subject to [a] high level of uncertainty’;

(c) Technical risks relating to Devas’s hybrid satellite and terrestrial system,
which included risks relating to the satellites specifically (e.g. launch failure)
as well as risks relating to the hybrid system (e.g. the need to develop
solutions for the ‘[i]nter-working of the satellite and terrestrial end-devices’);
and

(d) Regulatory risk, particularly relating to the authorisation required from the
DOT for terrestrial reuse of the spectrum (which we understood would be
issued by way of a WPC licence), given that Devas’s spectrum rights derived
from a contract with the Space Authorities.”°*

was due to the factors on which the Claimant has put emphasis in this arbitration,
namely the in-kind contributions and the negotiation power. Rather, the overall
review of the evidence, both documentary and testimonial, shows that such
reduction was linked to the risk profile of the investment. This being so, the almost

USD 600 million uplift to Devas’s enterprise value is unjustified.

Date.

investment (2009), the Tribunal considers that no significant progress was made
that would justify an upwards adjustment to Devas’s enterprise value. The best
evidence for this finding lies in the fact that DT paid the same price for the second
tranche of Devas shares as it did for the first purchase. This is recorded in no
uncertain terms in the Briefing Note of August 2009, in which, after evaluating all
of the circumstances, DT concluded that any progress Devas may have made in
the interim did no “justify a substantial increase in valuation” and that the same

valuation was still valid:

In conclusion, the Tribunal is unconvinced that the reduced price which DT paid

The Tribunal now turns to the third step within the Investment Plus method, which

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 93 of 125

“Current discussions with Devas focus on the $45m-tranche. Preliminary
negotiations have narrowed a possible pre-money valuation down to between
$375m (DT) and $650m (Devas). In justification for the rise in valuation versus
the initial tranche in 2008 (valuated at $300m; Devas had originally insisted
on $650m), Devas advances the argument of progress-made in the meantime
regarding regulatory, technical and operational matters. In DT’s assessment.
while certain progress is not denied, such progress does not justify a
substantial increase in valuation, i.e. it is appropriate to consider the post-
money valuation of the initial round, i.e. $375m, as the current pre-money
valuation.”369

 

 

265. At that time in August 2009, DT’s assessment must have factored in the

developments relating to the grant of the WPC Experimental License in May 2009
and of the IPTV/ISP License in March 2009. Interestingly, neither of these
licenses was viewed as important enough to drive up the valuation of Devas.

266. It remains to be seen whether any upwards adjustment would be justified from

2009 until the Valuation Date in 2011. The Tribunal can see that some progress
may have been made towards the eventual roll out of the Devas system, for
instance in the performance of the trials in 2009 and 2010. At the same time, the
record is reasonably clear that important risks continued to be present, if they had
not increased. First, as discussed above in respect of the licensing risks, the risks
related to the issuance and fee of the WPC License were high (see supra at 162).
In this connection, an event which should not be overlooked is the BWA Auction
in 2010, a fact which both Parties have emphasized to support their arguments.
The Tribunal considers this event as neutral from a valuation point of view. On
the one hand, the auction confirmed that spectrum was a highly valuable resource
and Devas already had allocated spectrum. On the other hand, it showed the
Government's determination to charge a high fee for it, which can be regarded
as a risk for DT/Devas (even though — as explained above — Devas was not in
the same position as the BWA winning bidder). In light of this ambivalence, the
BWA Auction is not a helpful indication for purposes of valuing Devas.

267. Furthermore, in the relevant time frame, a number of technological risks

389

materialized which should not be ignored. In particular, ISRO experienced a

increase in the valuation of Devas. If any progress was made, its effect was
neutralized by the risks that the Devas project incurred in relation to the satellite
launch and the granting of WPC License. These risks had already driven the

(iv) Conclusive remarks

Tribunal can dispense with reviewing the remaining step, actually the first one,
i.e. whether the USD 375 million implied value can be extrapolated from DT’s
2008 cash contribution of USD 75 million. Indeed, whatever finding the Tribunal
were to make on that point, it would have no impact on its conclusion that the

— “provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence,

sunk costs. The Tribunal first summarizes the Parties’ positions on the sunk costs
approach (infra at V.B.3.a-b), starting with the Respondent who proposed this
methodology in the alternative to its primary submission that no damages are

owed. The Tribunal then provides its analysis (infra at V.B.3.c).

In addition, India submits that it is irrelevant that, as the Claimant argues, any
funds Devas had on the Valuation Date were “practically exhausted by the end
of 2017, and the very small amounts remaining on the books were frozen”.5%° By
way of example, so says India, “if Mr. Viswanathan [the President and CEO of
Devas] wanted to throw a big party [...] for all the Devas people and spend
USD 100 million”*°° after the Valuation Date, that may mean that DT would not
get its money back, but India would not be responsible for such loss.

Thus, according to India, “[w]hatever happened after the Valuation Date is not
attributable to any treaty breach by the Respondent and cannot legally or logically
be included in the sunk costs calculation”."' In this respect, it draws the Tribunal’s
attention to the following facts:

a. Devas spent USD 17 million litigating against Antrix, rather than amicably
winding up the company;4°

b. On 31 March 2010, Devas’s Board approved the transfer of
USD 15 million to its subsidiary, Devas Multimedia America Inc.
(“DMA").4°3 The board minutes record that this amount was in addition to
the “[USD] 15 million that had been approved right before the DT
transaction”.4°* The funds are said to be for “continued support of
procurement and technology development programs”,4°> despite the fact
that this was apparently DT’s domain.*°° India further relies on the fact
that DT’s witnesses were unable to explain “what [these] funds were for,
and none could explain what was done with that money”. 497

that Dr. Flores’s counterfactual scenario is in any event deeply flawed for the

following reasons.

annulment of the Devas Agreement. In a counterfactual scenario where Devas
was liquidated but the Devas Agreement was not annulled, there would be no
return of the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees (USD 13.7 million) because
those fees were linked to the annulment. Rather, on the Valuation Date, assuming
no termination, Devas would have been contractually committed to pay Antrix at
least USD 216 million.*! This is because, pursuant to the Devas Agreement,
Devas was obligated to pay (i) USD 20 million “for each satellite, to be paid in
three equal installments” and (ii) “annual lease fees and critical component
acquisition fees. The lease fees would start at USD 9 million per year and
increase to USD 11.25 million per year once Devas became cash flow
positive”.412 Mr Harman has calculated that this would amount to USD 216

Second, Dr. Flores’ counterfactual assumptions are incorrect in several ways:

a.

It does not automatically follow that a “liquidation event” would trigger a
liquidation. A liquidation could only be triggered by a majority of directors
of Devas, requiring a vote from DT’s Supervisory Board, or by way of
voluntary liquidation which, under Indian law, requires a special resolution
of Devas’s shareholders.*"4 Thus, DT had no contractual right to trigger a
liquidation, as accepted by Dr. Flores.‘S Dr. Flores’s assumption also
ignores “the likelihood of a lack of alignment between DT and the other
shareholders”;4"

. There is evidence which illustrates that a liquidation in India is a “very

long, drawn out process”.‘’” If the liquidation had been challenged in the
Indian courts, there is no certainty that liquidation payments would have
been made in accordance with Exhibit B to the Share Subscription
Agreement of 2008;418

Dr. Flores’s sunk cost calculations are incorrectly drawn from Devas’s
financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared on a
“going concern” basis, which does not apply to a liquidation scenario, as
it does not account for (i) the possibility of crystallisation of various
liabilities (including liabilities from potential proceedings and regulatory
investigations);4"° (ii) additional costs incurred in a liquidation scenario;
and (iii) the lower value of assets in such a scenario.47°

If, contrary to the Claimant's position, the Tribunal were to adopt the sunk cost

method, then, so says the Claimant, it should award an amount of USD 198

million based on FTI’s calculation. This figure is arrived at by taking the amount

DT invested, i.e. USD 97.2 million, deducting any amounts available to DT today

and then applying “a reasonable rate of return from the time DT invested its

to sunk costs when liability is established but no other valuation method appears
appropriate. In the words of the tribunal in Caratube v. Kazakhstan, for instance:

“A majority of the Tribunal thus finds that the valuation methods proposed by
the Claimants do not provide a basis for damages that are sufficiently certain.
In these circumstances, a majority finds that an award of sunk investment
costs is appropriate and it will thus apply this method. As observed by Marboe,
[.]:

‘[...]This seems to be a “solid” valuation approach that has been applied in
numerous cases where other items of damages were considered to be too
speculative or were not supported by sufficient evidence’."476

As explained by Ripinsky and Williams, tribunals “have turned to the historic costs
of investment as the relevant approach to valuation when the evidence necessary
to apply an income-based method has been considered insufficient’.42” These
authors have also noted that “[t]hese cases generally involve investments that
have not yet started to generate cash flows or where the history of such
operations has been found too short to allow projection of future earnings”.428

The recent arbitral award in South American Silver v. Bolivia aptly summarized
the authorities on this point:479

“Cost-based valuation is not foreign to international investment arbitration. In
various circumstances, tribunals have discarded other methods in favor of the
valuation by reference to actual investments or cost of investment’ for
reasons such as that the project is not in the production stage,’ or that, given
the stage of the project, the estimation of future cash flows would be wholly
speculative,’ or that there is an insufficiently solid basis on which to calculate
profits or growth,’ or that it is not a going concern and there are uncertainties
regarding future income and costs," or that there is a particularly large
difference between the investments made and the compensation claimed."

Some of these tribunals have referred to the cost-based approach as
representing the “fair market value” of the investments in those cases.**° In this
Tribunal’s view, this would only be correct, if under the given circumstances it
could be assumed that the amounts actually spent by the investor were
equivalent to the price a hypothetical willing buyer would be ready to pay.*5' This
question, however, is of secondary importance here, as the Tribunal is not limited
to the FMV‘? but, in the absence of a different or more specific standard in the
Treaty,**° must seek to implement the full reparation principle under customary

See, e.g., Metalclad, Exh. CLA-41, para. 122 (“the Tribunal agrees with the parties that
fair market value is best arrived at in this case by reference to Metalclad's actual
investment in the project”, with further references to cases).

As explained by Marboe, Exh. RLA-221, p. 745, equating sunk costs with FMV cannot
generally be taken for granted and the FMV may be less or more, depending on the
reasonableness of the invested amounts and the economic prospects of the investment
project at the valuation date from the perspective of the market participants.

The Tribunal finds confirmation for this approach in Caratube, where the tribunal noted
that “when determining the amount of money that will provide full reparation to the injured
party, this Tribunal does not consider itself limited to the FMV standard, but may apply
other methods to determine the amount that, in the Tribunal's opinion, best reflects the
damages incurred by [the claimant]”. See Caratube, Exh. CLA-152, para. 1084.

Like many, international investment agreements, the BIT only provides for a standard of
compensation for /awful expropriation. See Article 5(1) of the BIT (stating that
compensation for lawful expropriation “shall be equivalent to the value of the expropriated
or nationalised investment immediately before the date on which such expropriation or
nationalisation became publicly known. Such compensation shall be effectively realisable
without undue delay and shall be freely convertible and transferable. Interest shall be paid
in a fair and equitable manner for the period between the date of expropriation or
nationalisation and the date of actual payment of compensation’). It provides no guidance
on the determination of damages for Treaty breaches, such as unlawful expropriation and
violation of FET. In accordance with the majority of the case law on this point (on which
see, amongst many, British Caribbean Bank Ltd. v. Government of Belize, PCA Case No.
2010-18/BCB-BZ, Award, 19 December 2014, Exh. CLA-150, para. 288) and as noted
infra in the text, the Tribunal must apply the full reparation principle under customary
international as it arises from Chorzéw and as codified in Article 31 of the ILC Articles.

international law as set out in Chorzow and restated in the ILC Articles,#** a point
which is undisputed.**5 In doing so, the Tribunal may either award the FMV or, if

there is insufficient evidence in the record to reach a reasonably reliable

assessment of FMV, resort to different indicators of the damage caused.

determination of damages is not an exact science, but an area in which it enjoys

acertain margin of discretion, in light of the inherent uncertainties that are tied to
the valuation exercise (see supra paras. 126 et seq.). This being so, where other
valuation methods proposed by a claimant are not supported by sufficient
evidence to establish the quantum to a reasonable degree of certainty and thus
prove inadequate under the circumstances, sunk costs may represent the best
(or the only) alternative approach to determine the amount of damages incurred
by the investor. In other words, if because of lack of evidence the Tribunal is
incapable of determining the loss by reference to methods that normally would
yield more accurately the value of the investment but for the breach, it may resort

to sunk costs which restores the situation before the investment was made.

Adopting this approach entails that the investor is not necessarily restituted the

value of its investment before the breach, but rather awarded what is sometimes

referred to as “reliance interest”,“°° i.e. it is compensated for funds it has put into
the investment. In some instances, the market value and the sunk costs may end
up being the same, although this may not always be the case. However, where

the Tribunal is incapable of determining the value of the investment through other

methods because the evidence is insufficient, the award of damages equal to the

See, e.g., British Caribbean Bank Ltd. v. Government of Belize, PCA Case No. 2010-

18/BCB-BZ, Award, 19 December 2014, Exh. CLA-150, para. 288.

See Memorial paras. 153-160; Reply, paras. 28-29. The Respondent does not disagree

that this is the relevant standard.

See Mark Kantor, Valuation for Arbitration: Compensation Standards, Valuation methods
and Expert Evidence (Kluwer Law International 2008), Exh EO-010, pp. 40 (“awarding to
an injured investor recovery of its wasted investment (‘sunk investment costs’) [...]
protects the investor's reliance interest — compensation is calculated to put the investor
back in the position as if the investment had never been made”), 50 (“In the context of
investment treaty disputes, however, fair market value measures have been rejected in a
number of cases in favor of compensation based on sunk investment costs — recovery of
the ‘reliance interest’ by seeking to put the investor back into a position as if he had never

made the investment’).

102

In this respect, the Tribunal recalls its previous observations whereby the

439

funds actually expended may represent the best method to achieve full
reparation.9”

In this case, the Tribunal has concluded that the forward-looking valuation
methods proposed by the Claimant, and in particular the DCF approach, provide
no basis upon which the Tribunal can estimate the extent of the Claimant’s loss
with reasonable confidence.*** As explained in the previous sections, this is due
principally to the lack of an evidentiary record of profitability owing to the
development stage of the Devas project and to some extent the uncertainty
regarding the licensing issues. The Tribunal has also noted the evidentiary
deficiencies in determining FMV based on an assessment of enterprise value
reflecting in-kind contributions and superior bargaining power. In these
circumstances in which the Tribunal is not in a position to determine Devas’s
future cash flows with sufficient certainty, it reaches the conclusion that the sunk
cost approach is the best available method to ensure full reparation by placing
DT in the situation in which it would find itself had it never made its investment.

In light of this conclusion, the Tribunal now moves to determine the amount of
damages in accordance with this methodology. Sunk costs are calculated as the
capital invested in a project minus the capital already recovered from the project,
plus interest in order to account for the time value of money.*°°

The Tribunal’s starting point is thus the capital invested by DT. In this respect,
the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent and its expert that the Tribunal
should have regard to the amount DT could have recovered under a hypothetical
liquidation scenario. In this connection, it notes that Dr. Flores was instructed to

See also Irmguard Marboe, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International

in Investment Law, (Oxford University Press 2017), para. 5.243, who notes that a tribunal
may “well find that full reparation could best be achieved by a repayment of investment
and expenses undertaken plus an appropriate rate of interest”, adding that whether this
corresponds “to the fair market value of the investment is only of secondary importance”.

See supra sections V.B.1.c, V.B.2.c.

See Borzu Sabahi, Compensation and Restitution in Investor-State Arbitration (Oxford
University Press 2011), p. 132 (“[alwarding sunk investment costs allows the claimant to
recover its invested capital, minus what it already has recovered, plus a return on the
capital invested from the date of the injury until the date of recovery, in the form of
interest”); Irmguard Marboe, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International
in Investment Law (Oxford University Press 2017), para. 5.243 (“tribunals might well find
that full reparation could best be achieved by a repayment of investment and expenses
undertaken plus an appropriate rate of interest”).

443,

consider “what would have been DT Asia’s ‘sunk costs’ in Devas if Devas had
been liquidated as of the Valuation Date”.44° Under this scenario, Dr. Flores
concludes that, in the event of a hypothetical liquidation on the Valuation Date,
DT would have received a distribution of USD 73.1 million, implying “sunk” costs
of USD 24.1 million.

The Tribunal considers Dr. Flores’s hypothetical liquidation scenario inapposite
for the present sunk cost valuation. Unlike a forward-looking valuation method
(e.g., DCF) which requires consideration of a counterfactual and inevitably
involves some degree of speculation, a backward-looking approach such as sunk
costs seeks to quantify a claimant's loss on the basis of the amounts actually
invested. One of the advantages of this approach is precisely that it requires no
speculation or assumptions. Consistent with this logic, none of the cases cited by
India perform a sunk costs calculation based on a hypothetical counterfactual
(e.g., a liquidation of the company).441 Sunk costs being a matter of fact, as
opposed to hypothesis, the Tribunal observes that Devas was never liquidated
(neither on the Valuation Date nor until today). Hence, a hypothetical situation in
which DT could have recovered some of its costs in case of Devas’s liquidation
is irrelevant to a sunk costs analysis.

Going back to the Claimant’s investment in Devas, the Tribunal recalls that the
Claimant made its investment in two tranches: the first in 2008 in the sum of
USD 75 million and the second in 2009 in the sum of USD 22.2 million,‘“ totaling
USD 97.2 million. The Claimant has not argued, let alone substantiated, that its
sunk costs would exceed the amount of its investment, i.e. of the share price.4°

See Flores ER1, para. 8 (“counsel for Respondent has instructed me to [...] calculate
what would have been DT Asia's ‘sunk costs’ in Devas if Devas had been liquidated as
of the Valuation Date”); Flores ER2, para. 307 (“I was instructed to calculate DT Asia’s
sunk costs to show how much DT would have lost on its investment if Devas had been
dissolved at the Valuation Date”).

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 105 of 125

Neither does India or its expert dispute that DT invested this amount.*44 The
Tribunal has seen no evidence that the price paid by DT did not reflect that of an
arm’s-length transaction. Accordingly, in this case, the amount of sunk costs
corresponds to the value of the investment made by DT, i.e. the sum DT has
expended in the purchase of the Devas shares.“45

Moving now to the second step of the assessment of sunk costs, the Tribunal
must verify if DT has already recovered part of the capital invested, which part
would have to be deducted from the investment to reach the amount of sunk costs
to be awarded. In this respect, India suggests that DT may have recovered some
of its investment through funds transferred by Devas to its subsidiary DMA in
2010, as DT’s witnesses were unable to explain the purpose of that transfer or
the use of those funds following the transfer. The record contains no evidence to
suggest that DT has received any funds from Devas through DMA or otherwise.
The Tribunal therefore accepts DT’s submission that it has not recovered part of
its investment through these funds.

Still in the context of funds recovered, the Tribunal notes that DT still holds shares
in Devas (through its subsidiary DT Asia). The question thus arises whether these
shares represent a value that would need to be deducted from the invested funds.
This is not a matter of a counterfactual or hypothetical liquidation, but merely a
factual assessment. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that “the concept of

recovered by DT (nothing), in order to ‘repay — or ‘restitute’ — all the amounts of
investments undertaken and expenses incurred’ by the investor”), 226 (“As Mr Harman
explained at the Hearing, in the event the Tribunal were inclined to calculate DT’s loss on
the basis of the amounts it invested, one way to make the calculation might be: (i) to

deduct from the amount of DT’s investment (US$97.2 million); (ii) any sums available to
DT today; and then (iii) provide for a reasonable rate of return from the time DT invested
its funds”).

See, e.g., Flores ER2, paras. 307-308.

See also Phelps, Exh. RLA-197, paras. 1, 31, where the tribunal awarded sunk costs on
the basis of the amount expended for the purchase of the relevant shares (“The stock of
SICAB was divided into two classes, A and B. The class B shares were divided between
Phelps Dodge and NKT and represented 35 percent of the total stock; 25 percent was
issued to Phelps Dodge and 10 percent was issued to NKT. For its shares, Phelps Dodge
contributed U.S. $2.437.860. [...]” “Taking into account all relevant evidence, the Tribunal
concludes that the value of Phelps Dodge's ownership interest in SICAB on 15 November
1980 was equal to its investment, that is, U.S. $2,437,860. The Claimants are entitled to
compensation in that amount”, emphasis added).

sunk costs belongs” “in the real world”.“4° This implies reviewing whether there
are any net assets left in Devas as of today.**” DT’s position is that it is no longer
able to recover any funds from Devas because “today there are negligible funds
left in Devas to return to DT”.448 At the Hearing, the Claimant alleged that Devas’s
net assets were worth USD 19.9 million, as shown in slide 138 of the Claimant's
Opening Presentation, which referred to audited financial statements of Devas.‘49
This figure has not been disputed by the Respondent and is in line with the
testimony of the Respondent's quantum expert, Dr. Flores, that “[tloday, if you go
by the financial statements of 2017, there is not many assets left’.45° DT has,
however, emphasized that, next to the net assets, it is necessary to consider “the
company’s contingent liabilities which need to be crystallised”.45' It has referred,
in particular, to a USD 109 million penalty imposed by the Indian Enforcement
Directorate.*5* Separately, it has also alluded “to the cost of litigation that Devas
has been forced to bear”.*59

the concept of sunk costs belongs, there are no funds left to return to DT”). See also

See also South American Silver, Exh. RLA-217, a case relied on by the Respondent, in

the valuation method, the Date of Valuation, which was an important difference in a
valuation scenario based on the valuation method proposed by the Claimant and the
alternative system proposed in the Respondent's Rejoinder, is immaterial to a cost-based
valuation since the market changes between the dates disputed by the Parties do not
affect the determination of the Project's costs”.

The Tribunal is not satisfied that DT has provided sufficient evidence to support
the foregoing allegations that any funds left in Devas are indeed “negligible”, as
it contends. First, the Tribunal notes that the allegations regarding litigation costs
incurred by Devas have not been substantiated. In addition, the contingent
liabilities referred to by DT are by their nature conditional. They are thus too
uncertain to lead to an automatic assumption that they would wipe out all of
Devas’s remaining net assets. Furthermore, while the Claimant's expert has
clearly stated that, for a sunk costs analysis, “any sums available to DT today”
would need to be deducted from the amount of DT’s investment,** it has provided
no analysis of any such sums available. For the Tribunal, it was for DT to prove
that its own evidence showing net assets of USD 19.9 million did not reflect the
current status of Devas, which it has failed to do. As a consequence, the Tribunal
considers that the USD 19.9 million in net assets must be accounted for in the
valuation. Under the circumstances, and in the absence of any better indication
in the record, the Tribunal deducts from the funds invested by DT an amount
equal to 19.62% (which corresponds to the percentage of DT’s indirect
shareholding in Devas)**> of USD 19.9 million, i.e. USD 3.9 million. The Tribunal
accepts that such a deduction “involve[s] some approximation” (to use the words
of the Gold Reserve tribunal quoted above at para. 129). However, it considers
that it leads to a result that represents a reasonable assessment of the sunk costs
on the basis of the available evidence.

Finally, the Tribunal has taken note of the Respondent's point that, after the
annulment of the Agreement, Devas may have spent its moneys in ways for which
India bears no responsibility. The Tribunal has, however, identified no evidence
in the record according to which after 2011 Devas would have spent funds in
ways which would not be related to the project or otherwise dissipated assets.

See C-PHB1, para. 226 (As Mr Harman explained at the Hearing, in the event the
Tribunal were inclined to calculate DT’s loss on the basis of the amounts it invested, one
way to make the calculation might be: (i) to deduct from the amount of DT’s investment
(US$97.2 million); (ii) any sums available to DT today; [...]”, referring to the hearing
transcript). See also Transcript, Day 4, p. 159, lines 13 - 20 (Harman) (“how would | think
about my general approach to sunk costs in that type of scenario? How much did DT
invest; and as of today, am | able to offset that lost investment by any sums that may be
available in the company, to the extent there are any funds in the company? As an expert,
if that was the valuation exercise that you said, then that's the calculation that | would
perform”).

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that DT is entitled to damages in the amount of
USD 93.3 million (i.e. the difference between USD 97.2 and 3.9 million).

Finally, the Tribunal turns to the Claimant's contention that the Tribunal should
apply a 31% IRR on DT’s investment from the date of the investment. As the
Claimant has noted, an IRR “is a measure of the investment’s expected
profitability”.*°° The Claimant has failed to demonstrate why the Tribunal should
apply an IRR to a sunk costs calculation other than to contend that “it is the logical
application of applying India’s own calculation of Devas’s IRR to DT’s sunk
investment”®’ and to rely on a passage from Mark Kantor’s book.“ Irrespective
of the fact that an IRR of 31% appears very high, the Tribunal sees no basis to
apply an IRR, which is a measure of profitability of an investment, to a sunk costs
valuation. Such an approach would blend two conflicting logics. Indeed, it
appears inapposite to apply a profit-based concept to historical costs, especially
where the Tribunal has been unable to assess profits with any reasonable
certainty.

This does not mean that the amounts invested cannot bear interest at a
commercial rate to compensate for the non-availability of the funds over time, a
matter discussed in the next section.

INTEREST AND TAX
The Claimant’s position

The Claimant submits that the award of interest is an integral component of the
principle of full reparation.8° Against that background, it requests that it be
awarded interest on the principal sum at a rate of LIBOR, or any other comparable

submission that tribunals have considered that “[a] state’s duty to make
reparation arises immediately after its unlawful act causes harm”.‘6"

The Claimant further asserts that DT is entitled to interest at a risk-adjusted rate,
rather than risk-free rate, as a risk-adjusted rate more appropriately reflects the
opportunity cost DT suffered as a consequence of not having available to it the

compensation that India should have paid to it on the Valuation Date.** It is also

more consistent with the use which a multinational corporation such as DT would
have made of those funds.*®

According to DT, the appropriateness of awarding LIBOR plus 4% is supported

by many recent investment treaty decisions, which have confirmed that it is

“reasonable” and a “normal commercial rate that guarantees _ full
compensation”.** This is particularly so given “the present market situation of
ultra-low interest rates”.465

investment arbitration.4®” In this respect, it disputes India’s arguments on simple
interest on the grounds that the cases on which India relies are outdated.46° An
award of compound interest would also prevent India from receiving a windfall.4©°

Finally, as concerns tax, to ensure full reparation, DT requests that the Tribunal:

a. declare that the award “is net of all applicable Indian taxes, charges or
other set-offs and that India may not tax or attempt to tax the award”,4”°
and

b. order that India is “to indemnify DT for any taxes India assesses on the
award and for any double taxation liability resulting from the award arising
in Germany or elsewhere that would not have arisen but for India’s
breach”.4”!

The Respondent’s position

The Respondent submits that, if the Tribunal decides to award interest, interest
should be simple and based on a short-term, risk-free rate, such as the six-month
or one-year US Treasury rate.‘”? This, so says India, is the generally accepted
practice as is demonstrated by a number of authorities.475

The Respondent therefore rejects the Claimant's argument that interest should
be awarded based on the Claimant's opportunity cost, since “it cannot be known
what [the] Claimant would have chosen to do with the compensation it would have
received in a ‘but for’ world”, and such an award would compensate DT for risks
it never bore.4”4 Moreover, several authorities have found it inappropriate to apply
the “opportunity cost” approach to the awarding of interest*”> and the decisions
relied upon by the Claimant do not award an interest rate based on opportunity
cost, but apply a short-term, risk-free interest rate.47°

For the Respondent, in finding that India breached the Treaty, “the Tribunal
effectively relieved [the] Claimant of any ‘risks’ associated with the proposed
Devas business”.*””

0. According to the Respondent, there is similarly no reason to award compound

interest which, contrary to the Claimant's allegations, is not the norm in
international arbitration.*”

Finally, the Respondent has made no submissions in relation to the Claimant's
request for declarations concerning taxes.

Analysis

While they diverge on the applicable rate of interest, the Parties are in agreement
on the principle that interest is payable. It is indeed hardly debatable that the
failure to pay a sum when due requires an award of interest for the creditor to be
made whole. As stated in Article 38 of the ILC Articles:

“1, Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when
necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of
calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.

2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid
until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.”

Tribunals have noted that the purpose of an award of interest is an integral aspect
of making the claimant whole for the losses suffered.4”° This is an approach also
supported by commentators.*®° For instance, as noted by the tribunal in Vivendi
v. Argentina:

“The object of an award of interest is to compensate the damage resulting
from the fact that, during the period of non-payment by the debtor, the creditor
is deprived of the use and disposition of that sum he was supposed to
receive.”#8!

internationally wrongful acts, with commentaries” [2001-II(2)], Yearbook of the
International Law Commission 1, Exh. CLA-126, Art. 38, p. 108. See also Rejoinder,
para. 170.

See, e.g., Vivendi Il, Exh. CLA-020, para. 8.3.20, where the Tribunal concluded that “[iJn
these circumstances, we calculate CAA’s investment damages to be US$105 million
(US$51 million plus US$54 million). As its 94.4% de facto shareholder, Vivendi is entitled
toa 94.4% share of CAA’s damages. However, in order ‘to wipe-out all the consequences
of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed
if the act had not been committed’ (the Chorzow principle), it is necessary for any award
of damages in this case to bear interest”.

See Borzu Sabahi, Compensation and Restitution in Investor-State Arbitration (Oxford
University Press 2011), p. 132 (“[alwarding sunk investment costs allows the claimant to
recover its invested capital, minus what it already has recovered, plus a return on the
capital invested from the date of the injury until the date of recovery, in the form of
interest”); Irmgard Marboe, Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International
in Investment Law (Oxford University Press 2017), para. 5.243 (“tribunals might well find
that full reparation could best be achieved by a repayment of investment and expenses
undertaken plus an appropriate rate of interest”).

This being so, as noted, the Parties do not agree on the appropriate interest rate
to be applied and on whether interest should be simple or compound.

Starting with the applicable interest rate, the Tribunal notes that it enjoys broad
discretion in determining the appropriate interest rate depending on the specific
circumstances of the case. As noted by the tribunal in Santa Elena:

“[T]he determination of interest is a product of the exercise of judgment taking

into account all of the circumstances of the case at hand and especially

considerations of fairness which must form part of the law to be applied by this

Tribunal.”482
While the practice of investment tribunals is not entirely uniform with regard to the
rate of interest awarded,*®° one widely accepted approach is to award interest at
a commercial rate, such as LIBOR (for loans of a given period) plus some
percentage points, frequently 2%.*®4 Such a rate would adequately compensate
DT for the loss of the use of the principal in the relevant time period. Investment
treaty tribunals often use floating interbank offered rates augmented with a
premium as an accurate indication of the market value of money in a specific
currency.*®> In case LIBOR were to be discontinued in the future, interest shall
accrue at a comparable rate, for instance, 6-month EURIBOR plus 2% p.a.*#°

Furthermore, in the Tribunal’s view, interest should be compounded in line with
generally accepted financial practice. If the Claimant had not been deprived of
the funds to which it was entitled, it could have invested them and would have
earned compound interest. Similarly, if as a result of the deprivation, it had to
borrow money, it would also have paid compound interest. Case law confirms this
choice.*®”

8. In respect of the dies a quo, the Tribunal considers that interest shall run from the

date of the breach, i.e. 17 February 2011, to the date of payment.

9. In conclusion, interest on the principal sum awarded shall accrue at a rate of

LIBOR (or any other comparable rate in case LIBOR should be discontinued in
the future), plus 2% p.a., compounded semi-annually, from 17 February 2011
until payment in full.

The Tribunal finally turns to the Claimant’s requests for a declaration and orders

in respect of taxes. It is unpersuaded that the Claimant has made out a sufficient
case for this type of requests. In line with other arbitral tribunals which have
dismissed similar claims, the Tribunal is of the view that such request would be
speculative and uncertain, as it is unclear, and has not been substantiated, what

type of taxes India or any other country may levy on the award.488 With particular

regard to any tax liability arising in countries other than India, the Tribunal is
unconvinced that a tax gross-up would meet the requirement of causation of the

loss. As held by the tribunal in Rusoro v. Venezuela, “[a]ny tax liability arising
under [the home State’s] tax laws (or from any other fiscal regime, other than the
[respondent State]), does not qualify as consequential loss arising from [the
respondent's] breach of the Treaty and does not engage [the respondent's]
liability”.°°

For these reasons, the Tribunal denies the Claimant's request for a declaration
and order in relation to taxes.

THE EFFECT OF THE ICC AWARD

As already recalled in the Interim Award,“°° on 19 June 2011, Devas commenced
an ICC arbitration against Antrix pursuant to Article 20 of the Agreement,
requesting specific performance or, in the alternative, damages of approximately
USD 1.6 billion. The seat of the arbitration was Delhi. The ICC tribunal issued a
final award on 14 September 2015 (referred to in this award as the “ICC Award”),
whereby it awarded USD 562.5 million plus interest to Devas “for damages
caused by Antrix's wrongful repudiation of the Devas Agreement”. Antrix filed an
action for annulment of the ICC Award before the Indian courts,“%' which set aside
proceedings the Tribunal understands are currently pending.

In its Memorial, the Claimant made the following statement:

“DT does not seek double recovery in relation to its investment, and would

take appropriate steps to ensure it is not compensated twice in the event that

any damages were ever to be paid by Antrix to Devas pursuant to the ICC

Award."4%?
At the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties for their positions on “the effects
of the fact that Devas was awarded compensation in the ICC arbitration on the
request for relief in this arbitration”.4°° The Tribunal also sought clarification as to

“what measures, including possibly what undertaking the Claimant would be

prepared to give in this respect”.4* The Tribunal invited the Parties to address
these questions in their closing statements at the end of the Hearing and/or post-
hearing submissions.*9°

In response to the Tribunal’s questions, in its closing statement, the Claimant
gave the following answer:

“[O]ur position remains the same today [as stated in DT’s written
submissions]: DT formally undertakes to ensure that no double recovery will
ensue. I'm sure the Tribunal are familiar with how this has just been dealt with
in the ConocoPhillips v Venezuela case. We would be very happy to have that
formally included in the award, so that at a later stage, before an enforcing
court, that is a formalised undertaking that can be dealt with at that stage, in
terms of figuring out how enforcement would happen. What | would just add
on enforcement is that we really don't think this is much of an issue because
the ICC award is being very much contested. Antrix has limited assets. And in
fact we have recently learnt that the government has incorporated a new
space company in India called NewSpace, which has been incorporated with
the same directors as Antrix, and the press is speculating about the fact that
this has been done to evade the enforcement of the ICC award. So we are not
seeing any kind of enforcement coming out of the ICC award very quickly.”4%°

The Claimant re-stated its position in similar terms in its first PHB.49”

India, for its part, gave the following answer to the Tribunal’s question in its
closing statement at the Hearing:
“(With respect to the ICC award, | do not see the answer right now, to be
honest. | firmly believe that the ICC award is untenable and will eventually be
set aside, for many reasons that we don't need to litigate here. But | frankly
have no idea at this time how to deal with the double recovery issue in the
meantime. Maybe I'll think of something for the post-hearing brief, but right
now I'm at a loss.”49°
The Respondent did not address the matter further in its post-hearing
submissions. It did, however, write to the Tribunal on 9 March 2020 to “provide

an update regarding the confirmation proceedings of the award rendered in the

See C-PHB1, para. 230 (“as regards the Tribunal’s question with respect to double
recovery, as indicated at the Hearing, DT’s position remains that it does not seek double
recovery in relation to its investment, and undertakes to take appropriate steps to ensure
it is not compensated twice in the unlikely event that any damages are ever paid by Antrix
to Devas pursuant to the ICC Award. Such an undertaking may be included in the
Tribunal’s Final Award so that, if necessary, it may be dealt with by an enforcement court
in due course”).

case Devas Multimedia Private Limited v. Antrix Corporation Limited, ICC Case
No. 18051/CYK (the ‘ICC Award’), in France”. The Respondent's update
concerned certain developments in enforcement proceedings relating to the ICC
Award in France, but did not address the Tribunal’s question on the possible risks
of double recovery.

The Tribunal had requested the clarifications regarding double recovery
mentioned above as it understood that such risk could materialize, because both
the ICC arbitration and the present arbitration deal with the same underlying facts
and the same economic harm, even though the parties and the legal bases are
distinct. Having reviewed the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal takes due notice of
DT’s undertaking that it does not seek double recovery in relation to its
investment, and that it will take appropriate steps to ensure that it is not
compensated twice in the event that any damages were to be paid by Antrix to
Devas pursuant to the ICC Award. The Tribunal will reflect such undertaking in
the operative part of this Award (see infra para. 357.e)).

COSTS
The Claimant’s position

The Claimant argues that, consistent with a long line of authorities,*°° costs
should follow the event. This is the default rule under Article 40 of the UNCITRAL
Rules and is in conformity with Article 9(2)(b)(vii) of the Treaty.

DT seeks the recovery of the following costs incurred in the jurisdiction and
liability phases of these proceedings:

“(i) its share of the fees of the Tribunal and the PCA, in the sum of
€300,000.00;

(ii) its reasonable witness costs in the sums of £19,791.29 and €5,082.00;
(iii) its reasonable costs for fees, disbursements and photocopying charges of
its international counsel, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, in the sum of
£4,972,260.40;

(iv) its reasonable costs for the fees and disbursements of Mr Samuel
Wordsworth QC, in the sum of £180,775.01;

(v) its reasonable costs for the fees and disbursements of its Indian counsel
in the sums of €28,895.00 and £77,185.00; and

(vi) the costs of the appointing authority in the sum of $10,000.00."5°°

For the quantum phase of this arbitration, DT seeks the recovery of the following
costs:

“(i) its share of the fees of the Tribunal and the PCA, presently set at
€125,000.00 and £177,858.41, to be finally determined by the Tribunal;

(ii) its reasonable witness costs in the sums of £14,792.91 and €3,276.36;

(iii) its reasonable costs for fees, disbursements and photocopying charges of
its international counsel, Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, in the sum of
£4,598,424.17;

(iv) its reasonable costs for the fees and disbursements of its quantum expert,
FTI Consulting, in the sum of £1,438,401.07;

(v) its reasonable costs for the fees and disbursements of its Indian counsel,
advisor and regulatory consultant, in the total sum of £382,225.26;

(vi) its reasonable costs for the fees and disbursements of its graphics
consultant, Immersion Legal, in the sum of £28,294.22; and

(vii) its reasonable costs for the fees and disbursements of Mr Samuel
Wordsworth QC, in the sum of £5,375.00.”5°'

Accordingly, in addition to the Tribunal and administrative costs, the Claimant
claims a total of GBP 11,717,524.30, EUR 433,358.36, and USD 10,000 in
respect of its legal fees and other expenses.

In addition, DT seeks interest on the costs recovered, from the date when those
costs were incurred, at LIBOR plus 4%.502

In support of its position, DT notes that it fully prevailed on the jurisdiction and
liability phase of this arbitration, which it contends in and of itself justifies awarding
the Claimant its costs.5° DT further invites the Tribunal to have regard to:

a. “India’s obdurate evasion of its responsibilities towards Devas and its
shareholders following the annulment of the Devas Agreement nearly a

3. Analysis

a. The costs of the arbitration pursuant to Article 38 of
the UNCITRAL Rules

338. Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:
“The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award. The term
‘costs’ includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator
and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;

(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral
tribunal;

(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses
are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party
if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the
extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is
reasonable;

344,

345.

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses
of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.”

Thus, Article 38 recognizes broadly three categories of costs and expenses:
(i) “Tribunal Costs” comprising the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and
Secretary; (ii) “Party Costs” comprising the legal and witness related costs
incurred by the Parties; and (iii) “Administrative Costs” comprising here the fees
and expenses of the PCA, including with regard to hearing and other expenses.

b. Cost advances

In the course of the arbitration, each Party made cost advances to the PCA in an
amount of EUR 805,000.00.

c. Tribunal and administrative costs

In the Interim Award, the Tribunal deferred its decision on fixing and apportioning
costs to its final award (see Interim Award, para. 423). Therefore, the present
decision concerns the costs incurred in connection with this arbitration for both
the jurisdiction/liability and quantum phases.

In the arbitration proceeding, the members of the Tribunal spent a total of
1,702.50 hours as follows: Mr. Daniel M. Price, 365.50 hours; Prof. Brigitte Stern,
469 hours; and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, 868 hours. In the Terms of Appointment,
the Parties agreed that the Tribunal’s time would be compensated at an hourly
rate of EUR 600 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.5"'

The Secretary of the Tribunal has spent a total of 702.50 hours. In the Terms of
Appointment, it was agreed that the Secretary would be compensated at an
hourly rate of EUR 300 exclusive of VAT, where applicable.

Therefore, the total fees of the Tribunal and the Secretary (excluding VAT)
amount to EUR 1,232,250.00.

The Tribunal and the Secretary have incurred expenses in the amount of
EUR 55,325.46.

It is noted that the Parties agreed to derogate from part of Article 9(2)(b)(vii) of the BIT,
which reads as follows: “Each party concerned shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator
and its representation in the arbitral proceedings. The cost of the Chairman in
discharging his arbitral function and the remaining costs of the tribunal shall be borne
equally by the parties concerned”.

The PCA fees for the administration of the case and its registry services amount
to EUR 29,740.00.

Other costs, relating in particular to the hearings expenses, catering, court
reporting services, amount to EUR 143,229.18.

Thus, the total costs of the proceedings amount to EUR 1,460,544.64.

Considering that the Parties advanced a total of EUR 1,610,000.00 towards the
advances on costs, the balance to be returned to the Parties in accordance with
Art. 41(5) UNCITRAL Rules amounts to EUR 149,455.36. The PCA will provide
the Parties with the case statement of account in due course.

d. Allocation of the costs of the arbitration

Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules sets out the standard on the basis of which the
Tribunal must determine the allocation of the above categories of costs:

“1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle
be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may
apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that
apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the
case.

2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to

in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the

circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear

such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines

that apportionment is reasonable. [...]”
Thus, the first sentence of Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the
unsuccessful party shall in principle bear all of the costs of the arbitration. The
second sentence of Article 40(1) grants the Tribunal the authority to apportion
costs among the Parties if, in light of the “circumstances of the case”, it decides
that such apportionment is “reasonable”.

The Tribunal starts with the outcome of the arbitration. The Claimant has
prevailed on jurisdiction and liability. On quantum, it has partially prevailed as the
damages awarded were less than what it claimed, and the two primary valuation
methodologies which it had proposed were dismissed by the Tribunal. In
assessing the outcome, however, it bears noting that the Claimant would not be
made whole had it not resorted to arbitration, which could not be done without
incurring costs whatever the amounts claimed and awarded.

122

Case 1:21-cv-01070-RJL Document 1-4 Filed 04/19/21 Page 123 of 125

353. Thus, considering the outcome of the claims and “the circumstances of the case”
(Article 40 UNCITRAL Rules), the Tribunal determines that the cost allocation
that most appropriately reflects the outcome of the proceedings is the following:

a. The Respondent shall bear the entirety of the costs of the proceedings
(Tribunal and PCA fees and expenses);

b. The Respondent shall bear the Claimant's legal fees and other expenses
incurred for the jurisdiction and liability phase;

c. Each Party shall bear the legal fees and other expenses which it incurred
in the quantum phase.

354. Inline with the second sentence of Article 40(1), the Tribunal has further reviewed
whether there were other circumstances, including those enumerated by the
Claimant in its cost submissions, which would warrant any different
apportionment of costs and has come to the conclusion that there were none. In
particular, the Tribunal notes that, while tribunals often take into account a party's
procedural conduct in their decision on the allocation of costs, in this case, both
Parties have conducted these proceedings in a professional and cost-effective
manner.

355. In accordance with Article 38(1)(e) UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal has reviewed
the amounts of the costs claimed by each Party. Both sides have incurred costs
which are certainly considerable. However, these proceedings were highly
complex and involved a multitude of difficult legal, regulatory, and quantum
issues, with the result that the costs incurred appear commensurate with the
complexity of the dispute and the high stakes involved.

356. The Claimant has further sought interest on the costs awarded at a rate of LIBOR
plus 4% from the date those costs were incurred. As noted by the tribunal in
Canfor v. United States, “interest over costs of arbitration is rarely claimed in
international arbitration, although the rationale for that practice is not entirely
clear”.5'2 Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that, consistent with the principle
of full reparation, India should pay interest on the costs awarded. Such interest
should be computed at the same rate as the interest payable on the damages

America, UNCITRAL Arbitration Proceeding, Joint Order on the Costs of Arbitration and for
the Termination of Certain Arbitral Proceedings, 19 July 2007, para. 189.

awarded, should be compounded in the same manner, and should start to run 30
days after the date of this award.

OPERATIVE PART
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

a. The Republic of India shall pay to Deutsche Telekom AG the amount of
USD 93.3 million, together with interest on such amount at a rate of 6-
month USD LIBOR (or any other comparable rate in case LIBOR were to
be discontinued in the future) plus 2% p.a., compounded semi-annually,
from 17 February 2011 until payment in full;

b. The costs of this arbitration are fixed at EUR 1,460,544.64;

c. The Republic of India shall pay to Deutsche Telekom AG the amounts of
EUR 730,272.32 as reimbursement of the costs of the arbitration, as well
as GBP 5,250,011.70 and EUR 33,977.00 and USD 10,000.00 as
reimbursement of part of Deutsche Telekom AG’s legal fees and other
expenses, together with interest on such amounts at a rate of 6-month
USD LIBOR (or any other comparable rate in case LIBOR were to be
discontinued in the future) plus 2% p.a., compounded semi-annually,
starting to run 30 days after the date of this award until payment in full;

d. Except as stated in subparagraph (c) above, each Party shall bear the
legal fees and other expenses which it incurred in connection with this
arbitration;

e. The Tribunal takes note of Deutsche Telekom AG’s undertaking that it
does not seek double recovery in relation to its investment, and will take
appropriate steps to ensure that it is not compensated twice in the event
that any damages were to be paid by Antrix Corporation Limited to Devas
Multimedia Private Limited pursuant to the ICC Award;

f. All other claims and requests are dismissed.
