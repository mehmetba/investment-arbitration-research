INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’”) on the basis of the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty
(the “ECT”), to which the Italian Republic has been a party since 16 April 1998, and the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other

States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimant is Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione (“Eskosol” or the “Claimant”), a company
incorporated under the laws of the Italian Republic, with an 80% shareholding by Blusun S.A.

(“Blusun”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of Belgium.
The Respondent is the Italian Republic (“Italy” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

The dispute relates, in general terms, to certain changes that Italy enacted in 2011 to a program
of incentives that it previously had put in place to encourage the building of additional
photovoltaic (“PV”) solar facilities in the country. The Claimant alleges that the investment
it had made towards constructing a substantial PV project in Italy, in the expectation of
qualifying for the incentive program while that program remained in effect, was rendered
unviable as a result of the changes Italy enacted in 2011. The Claimant contends that Italy
bears international responsibility under the ECT in these circumstances, which Italy rejects
on the merits. Italy also contends that, as a threshold matter, the Claimant may not pursue its
ECT claims because it already was in liquidation proceedings in Italy when it commenced
this suit, and because its majority shareholder already had brought an ECT claim involving
related events, although not on behalf of the Claimant or involving the Claimant’s receiver in
those proceedings. The Tribunal turns to these various jurisdictional and merits issues after

addressing certain preliminary matters below.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 11 December 2015, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 9 December 2015 from
Eskosol against Italy (the “Request for Arbitration”).

On 22 December 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration
in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed
to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s

Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

By letter of 14 March 2016, the Claimant requested that, in the absence of an agreement
between the Parties, the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in

Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

On 15 March 2016, following appointment by the Claimant, ICSID notified the Parties that

Prof. Guido Santiago Tawil had accepted his appointment as arbitrator.

On 6 April 2016, following appointment by the Respondent, ICSID notified the Parties that
Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy had accepted his appointment as arbitrator. Prof. Dupuy
subsequently withdrew his acceptance on 25 June 2016, and was replaced by Prof. Brigitte

Stern, who accepted her appointment on 1 August 2016.

By letter of 1 June 2016, the Claimant requested that the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council appoint the President in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID
Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4(1). By letter of 21 June 2016, ICSID invited the
Parties to consider a list of five candidates in view of finding a mutually acceptable President
by ballot prior to commencing the requested Article 38 appointment. By letter of 25 June
2016, ICSID notified the Parties that, in light of Prof. Dupuy’s resignation, the ballot

procedure was suspended.

By email of 12 August 2016, the Claimant notified ICSID that the Parties had agreed to a new

method for appointment of the President, specifically:

a. The co-arbitrators shall have until September 12 to agree on at least one name for
presiding arbitrator (the “President”) that would be acceptable to both of them.
Each Party may have ex parte communications with the co-arbitrator it appointed

solely for the purpose of discussing the appointment of the President.

b. If the co-arbitrators cannot reach agreement by the above-mentioned deadline,
either Party shall be free to resort to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention for the

purpose of the appointment of the President of the Tribunal.

c. Ifthe co-arbitrators agree on one or more names, the Parties shall have two weeks
as of the date on which such agreement is communicated to them to approve the
proposed name or agree on a President if the co-arbitrators were able to agree on
two or more names. If this two-week time-window expires with no such
confirmation or agreement, as applicable, either Party will be free to resort to

Article 38 of the ICSID Convention to appoint the President.

d. While the above mechanism is underway, the Parties agree that ICSID should not
resume the ballot procedure it suspended as a result of Prof. Dupuy withdrawing

his acceptance to serve as Italy’s co-arbitrator.

By letter of 15 September 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that, pursuant to their agreed-
upon method, it had contacted the candidate for President proposed by the co-arbitrators;

however, the candidate did not have availability to accept his appointment.

By letter of 20 September 2016, the Claimant again requested that the Chairman of the
Administrative Council proceed to appoint the President under Article 38. By letter of 1

October 2016, ICSID transmitted a new ballot to the Parties.

By letter of 12 October 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that the ballot was successful, and
that Ms. Jean Kalicki had been selected as President. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration

Rule 5(2), ICSID proceeded to seek Ms. Kalicki’s acceptance.

On 19 October 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules

of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the Parties that

20.

all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore
deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Francisco Abriani, ICSID Legal Counsel,

was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal is composed of Ms. Jean Kalicki, a national of the United States of America,
President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Prof. Guido Santiago Tawil, a national of
Argentina and Portugal, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stern, a national of

France, appointed by the Respondent.

On 18 November 2016, the Respondent filed an objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule
41(5), asking that the proceedings be dismissed for manifest lack of legal merit (the “Rule
41(5) Objection”).

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on 2 December 2016, by teleconference.
On 23 December 2016, the Claimant filed its response to the Rule 41(5) Objection.

Following the first session, on 4 January 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1
provided, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10
April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceedings
would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the agreed schedule for the
proceedings, including a hearing in Paris on 8 February 2017, for oral arguments on the Rule

41(5) Objection.

On 13 January 2017, the Respondent submitted its reply to the Claimant’s response to the
Rule 41(5) Objection.

On 16 January 2017, the European Commission (the “Commission’”) filed an Application for
Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (the “Commission’s Application”) pursuant to
ICSID Arbitration Rule 37. By letter of 17 January 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to

submit their observations on the Commission’s Application by 3 February 2017.

27.

On 18 January 2017, the Respondent filed a Request for Provisional Measures under ICSID
Arbitration Rule 39(1) (the “Request for Provisional Measures”), seeking, inter alia, an order
on security for costs. By letter of 23 January 2017, the Tribunal asked the Parties to revert by
30 January 2017, with a proposed schedule for briefings on the Respondent’s Request for

Provisional Measures.

On 1 February 2017, the Claimant submitted its rejoinder to the Respondent’s Rule 41(5)
Objection.

On 3 February 2017, as anticipated in the Tribunal’s letter of 17 January 2017, the Parties

filed their respective observations on the Commission’s Application.

A hearing on the Respondent’s Rule 41(5) Objection was held in Paris on 8 February 2017.

On 3 March 2017, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent’s Request for Provisional

Measures.

On 6 March 2017, the European Commission submitted its Amicus Curiae Brief with

accompanying documentation.

On 20 March 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent’s Application Under Rule
41(5), in which it denied Italy’s Rule 41(5) Objection and reserved its decision on costs for a

later stage in the proceedings.

On 12 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, denying the Respondent’s
Request for Provisional Measures and deferring the question of costs to later in the

proceedings.

By emails of 24 April 2017, the Parties informed the Centre that they had agreed to an
extension until 9 May 2017 for the Claimant to file its Memorial on the Merits (the
“Memorial”). By email of the same date, ICSID confirmed that the Tribunal accepted the

extension upon consent.

On 9 May 2017, the Claimant filed its Memorial, along with accompanying exhibits, the
witness statements of Messrs. Antonio Magli (“Magli I’) and Roberto Scognamiglio
(“Scognamiglio I’), and the expert report of Dr. Martin Stickel of Fichtner Management

On | August 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, dismissing the Respondent’s

providing the detailed reasoning for its decision in Procedural Order No. 4.

Also on 15 September 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, in which it provided
the detailed reasoning for its decision in Procedural Order No. 2 on the Commission’s

Application.

On 27 October 2017, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (the “Counter-
Memorial”) and supporting documentation, including the expert reports of Profs. Elena Maria
Fumagalli and Stefano Pedrini (“Fumagalli/Pedrini’”), and of Profs. Maurizio Delfanti and

Mario Motta (“Delfanti/Motta I”).

By email of 13 December 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to the
following amended schedule for the remainder of the proceedings: 2 March 2018, for the
Claimant’s Reply on the Merits; 25 May 2018, for the Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits;
15 June 2018, for the Claimant’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction; and 20 June 2018, for exchanges

of notices regarding witnesses for the Hearing.

Following exchanges between the Parties, by letter of 14 December 2017, the Tribunal issued

its rulings on the Parties’ document requests.

By further letter of 14 December 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was agreeable
to their proposed amendments to the schedule, subject to the pre-hearing conference call being
rescheduled to either 2 or 3 July 2018, rather than the original date of 25 June 2018. By letter
of 19 December 2017, ICSID informed the Parties that the pre-hearing call would take place
on 3 July 2018.

By letter of 10 January 2018, the Tribunal noted that the Hearing originally had been
scheduled for 24-28 September 2018, but asked the Parties whether the final day might be
released, based on the small number of witnesses involved and in light of a possible conflict
for one of the Tribunal members. By email of 11 January 2018, the Respondent confirmed
that it had no objection to the proposed change. By email of 15 January 2018, the Claimant

confirmed its agreement to the change.

The proceeding was closed on 25 August 2020.

Ill. ITALY’S SUSPENSION REQUEST

89.

90.

91.

As noted above, six weeks after the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Termination, which
denied Italy’s jurisdictional objection based on the inapplicability of the ECT to intra-EU
disputes, Italy requested that the Tribunal nonetheless suspend these proceedings, on account
of a matter then pending before the CJEU. Specifically, Italy mentioned two referral orders
issued in May 2018 by the Italian Administrative Court of Lazio, asking the CJEU to consider
whether the effects of the “Spalma Incentivi Decree” (Legislative Decree No. 91/2014) are
contrary to certain provisions of EU law and/or to Article 10 of the ECT. Italy’s contention
was that a suspension of this arbitration would “[g]iv[e] room to the [CJEU]” to address “the

same ECT standards,” and therefore promote consistency and legal certainty.”

In response, Eskosol noted inter alia that neither it, nor any of the special purpose vehicles
(“SPVs”) it owned, were party to the local proceedings that had given rise to the referred
cases, nor did the Spalma Incentivi Decree have any relevance to this case. Eskosol also
observed that this Tribunal “is an international investment tribunal empanelled under a
different legal order and pursuant to its own duties,” as explained in the Decision on
Termination, and therefore that a suspension of these proceedings would be unwarranted even

apart from the lack of any overlap as to parties or measures at issue in the two cases.

The Tribunal saw no basis for a suspension of its work. At the time the request was filed, the

Tribunal had just issued a lengthy and detailed decision explaining its independent duty to

" Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein v. Italian Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/14/3.
2 Respondent’s letter of 18 June 2019.

decide this ECT dispute, regardless of the CJEU’s role as the final arbiter of EU law. It is not
clear why Italy waited until after that decision was rendered to inform the Tribunal that a year
earlier, an Italian court apparently had referred questions about a different Italian measure to
the CJEU, raising in that context certain issues regarding the ECT. Be that as it may, the
pendency of such questions before the CJEU in no way altered the Tribunal’s decision
regarding its responsibility to proceed to resolve the issues entrusted to it. The Tribunal
therefore determined to press ahead in its preparation of this Award, addressing the suspension

request in the context of this Award rather than in yet another interim decision.

PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
The Claimant’s request for relief, as stated in its Post-Hearing Brief, is as follows:

Eskosol respectfully requests that the Tribunal:

(i) Declare that Italy has breached its obligations towards Eskosol’s Investments
and Eskosol itself under the ECT and/or international law;

(ii) Declare that Italy’s actions and omissions, as described in Eskosol’s
submissions, are unfair and inequitable; unreasonable; have failed to protect
Eskosol’s Investments; have failed to observe its obligations with Eskosol or
Eskosol’s Investments under the “umbrella clause” in the ECT; and have
effectively expropriated Eskosol’s Investments without prompt, adequate and
effective compensation;

(iii) Award Eskosol compensation for all damages, including loss of profits, caused
by Italy’s breaches of the ECT and/or international law towards Eskosol or
Eskosol’s Investments, in an amount of at least EUR 196,717,000 for its lost
profits claim; and alternatively award Eskosol its sunk costs in an amount of at
least EUR 37.9 million.

(iv) Award Eskosol pre-award interest in an amount of at least EUR 18,825,558 as
of 30 November 2018 for its lost profits claim, or alternatively award Eskosol
pre-award interest in an amount of at least EUR 3,630,808 as of 30 November
2018 for its sunk cost damages.

(v) Order Italy to pay to Eskosol all the costs of these proceedings, with interest on
any relevant sum applied on the same basis as pre-award interest, including
Eskosol’s counsel fees and disbursements, the fees of the Tribunal and those of
the Centre (such costs and interest calculations to be provided by the Claimant
by way of Schedule of Costs, currently anticipated to be submitted on 11 January
2019);

(vi) Award Eskosol post-award interest to be applied to the total amount ordered by
the Tribunal and any portion thereof remaining unpaid by the Italy in the future,
such interest to be compounded quarterly, and which rate of interest shall be
based on the Italian Consumer Price Index (Nic), as published by The Italian
National Institute of Statistics on the website: http://dati-istat.it/?lang=en#
(Section: Prices / Nic — Monthly.*

93. Italy’s request for relief, as expressed in its Memorial on Jurisdiction and in its Counter-
Memorial on the Merits (which in turn were incorporated by reference in the prayer for relief
included in the Respondent’s Rejoinder),* is as follows:

The Respondent respectfully requests that the Tribunal, after having bifurcated the

proceedings so that to judge exclusively on the objections on jurisdiction and
admissibility:

1. Rejects Eskosol’s request for arbitration for lack of jurisdiction and/or
inadmissibility;

2. order the Claimant to pay all the costs of these proceedings.*

94. In its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, the Respondent requested as follows:

[SJhould the Tribunal uphold its own jurisdiction on the claim and consider it
admissible, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:

(a) declare, on the merits, that all the claims of the Claimant under Article 10(1) and
[A]rticle 13 of the ECT are unfounded, for lack of a causal link between the
challenged Respondent’s conduct and the outcomes of the Project; and that, in
any case, the Respondent’s conduct does not constitute a violation of such rules.

b

In this context, declare the requests for damages not supported by sufficient
evidence of injury.

c

In the unfortunate event that the Tribunal were to uphold one of the claims of the
Claimant and award some form of compensation to the Claimant, declare the
appropriateness of the calculations of the damages and the interest proposed by
the Respondent.

d

In any event, exclude from any amount of compensation the part of contributory
fault attributable to the conduct of the Claimant, whose responsibility in the
negative outcomes of the Project exceeds that in any way attributable to the
Respondent.

e) Ordering the Claimant to pay the expenses incurred by the Italian Republic in
connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and
disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal
and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in accordance with
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.°

In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent requested as follows:

Together with its reiterated plea to declare its behaviors not to violate any of the
claimed provisions of the ECT, Respondent thus requests to be relieved from all costs
and expenses of this procedure.”

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Tribunal summarizes below certain relevant facts that are either agreed or that the
Tribunal has found to be proven by the evidence. These include background facts regarding
the regulatory framework applicable to solar energy projects in Italy, Eskosol’s investment in
Italy, and the measures Italy adopted in 2011 about which Eskosol complains in these
proceedings. The Tribunal emphasizes nonetheless that it does not purport to set out all facts
considered for purposes of this Award, and the absence of reference to particular facts or
assertions, or to the evidence supporting any particular fact or assertion, should not be taken
as an indication that the Tribunal did not consider those matters. The Tribunal has carefully

considered all evidence and arguments submitted to it in the course of these proceedings.

A. THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK PRIOR TO THE CHALLENGED MEASURES

On 27 September 2001, the European Commission issued Directive 2001/77/EC on the
promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in the internal electricity
market (the “2001 Directive”).® The purpose of the 2001 Directive was “to promote an
increase in the contribution of renewable energy sources of electricity production in the
internal market for electricity and to create a basis for a future Community framework

0d

thereof.”’ Among other things, this Directive set national indicative targets for each Member

99.

States’ contribution of electricity produced from renewable energy sources to gross electricity

consumption by 2010. Italy’s indicative target under the Directive was 25%.'°

Under the 2001 Directive, Member States were under an obligation periodically to publish a
report setting national indicative targets for future consumption of electricity produced from
renewable energy sources, taking into account the target set in the Directive, and outlining the
measures taken or planned.!! On the basis of those Member State reports, the Commission in
turn would assess to what extent the Member States had made progress towards achieving
their national targets, and whether the national targets were compatible with a “global
indicative target” of 12% of gross national energy consumption and with a 22.1% indicative
share of electricity produced from renewable energy sources in total Community electricity
consumption by 2010.'? If the Commission’s report concluded that the national indicative
targets were likely to be inconsistent with the global indicative target for reasons that were
“unjustified and/or do not relate to new scientific evidence,” the Commission was to propose

“national targets, including possible mandatory targets, in the appropriate form.”!?

The 2001 Directive also required the Commission to evaluate mechanisms used in Member
States to support producers of renewable energy, including “assess[ing] the success, including
cost-effectiveness, of the support systems ... in promoting the consumption of electricity
produced from renewable energy sources in conformity with the national indicative targets
referred to in Article 3(2).”"4 If necessary, the Commission was to propose a “Community

framework with regard to support schemes” for renewable energy, with any such proposal to:
a. Contribute to the achievement of the national indicative targets;

b. Be compatible with the principles of the internal electricity market;

c. Take into account the characteristics of the different sources of renewable
energy, together with the different technologies, and geographical differences;

100. On 29 December 2003, Italy enacted Legislative Decree No. 387 on the implementation of
the 2001 Directive. '° Article 7 of this legislative decree established that, within six months of

its enactment,

the Minister of Production, in concert with the Minister of the Environment and
Protection of Land and Sea, in agreement with the Unified Conference, will
implement one or more decrees setting forth the criteria aimed at incentivizing the
production of electric energy from solar sources. ... without any cost to the State
budget and observing current European Community Law .

These criteria, in turn:

sh[ould] establish the methodology to determine the amount of incentives. For
energy produced by means of photovoltaic conversion from solar sources, [the
criteria should] provide for a specific incentivising tariff, of a decreasing nature and
having a duration that ensures a fair return on the investment and operating costs.!*

101. On 18 April 2005, Italy enacted Law No. 62, concerning the implementation by Italy of
obligations arising from its EU membership. This law was aimed, inter alia, at completing
the process of liberalization of the energy sector, in order to implement the EU Directive
2003/54/CE concerning common rules for the domestic electricity market. Among the

principles to be followed in the implementation of EU policy was:

[to] develop the use of renewable energy sources and co-generation through market
instruments, providing a reorganization of the current legislative framework and a
differentiation based on types of power plants and introducing incentivising
mechanisms based on tender aimed at incentiviz[ing] the most advanced
technologies which are far from trade competitiveness, remaining understood that all
existing incentives for assimilated energies, at the end of the relevant deadline, will
stop. 9

On 28 July 2005, Italy enacted a Ministerial Decree containing what is known as “Conto
Energia I,” establishing incentives for investment in Italy’s solar PV sector.” Conto Energia
I established a mechanism consisting of pre-determined incentivizing tariffs to be paid to PV
plants having a nominal capacity lower than 100 kW, on the basis of the amount of electricity
injected into the grid, with the understanding that the tariffs recognized by the decree would
apply up to a “[mJaximum aggregate limit,” i.e., “until the total aggregate power of all power
plants that secure the same incentivizing tariffs reaches 100 MW.””! This aggregate limit on
power plants entitled to secure the special tariffs was in turn related to the “aggregate national
target of capacity from photovoltaic plants to be installed [by] 2015,” which was 300 MW.
The level of the tariffs a particular new or renovated power plant would receive depended on
its nominal capacity and on the date of the plant’s application for the tariffs,>> with the
understanding that the application was predicated on the plant’s being “connected to the grid”
and having “entered into operation following 30 September 2005.”*4 For plants with a
nominal capacity higher than 50 kW but lower than 100 kW, a rate of 0.490 euro/kWh was
established for plants whose application was submitted during 2005 or 2006, while those
plants whose applications were submitted after 2006 would have a tariff reduced by 2% for
each year after 2006, “it being understood that such incentivising tariff will be paid for twenty

years.”25

On 6 February 2006, Italy adopted a decree amending Conto Energia I “in light of the gained
experience,” and in particular “the high interest for photovoltaic conversion” which had led
to applications already exceeding the maximum aggregate limit previously set at 100 MW.?°

The amendment raised the national aggregate target of PV power to be installed by 2015 to

1,000 MW, and increased the “aggregate limit of plants that can secure the incentivising

tariffs” under Conto Energia I from 100 MW to 500 MW.””

On 19 February 2007, Italy enacted a Ministerial Decree containing “Conto Energia II.”?*
This decree “[c]onsider[ed] that the first results [of Conto Energia I and its amendment] have
shown a remarkable managerial complexity of the system and an excessive imbalance in
favour of the construction of large plants,” and “consider[ed] it appropriate to approve new
measures aimed at correcting the incentive mechanism by introducing a simplified, stable and
lasting scheme of access to the incentives.””° In order to qualify under Conto Energia II, PV
plants must not already have benefited from the prior regime, “must be connected to the grid,”
“must have entered into operation,” and must submit an application for the relevant incentive
rate within 60 days of entry into operation, following which they would be notified of the

approved tariffs.*°

The electric power produced by PV plants built in compliance with the decree, and which
came into operation between the effective date of Conto Energia II and 31 December 2008,
“has a right to an incentivising tariff ... identified on the basis of [a] table” set forth in the
decree, “valid for a period of twenty years from the date of entry into operation.”*! As with
Conto Energia I, the level of the tariffs again differed depending on when the plants entered
into operation, with plants entering into operation before 31 December 2008 receiving a rate
set out in Article 6(1), and those entering into operation during 2009 and 2010 receiving tariffs

reduced by 2% for each calendar year after 2008.7

As with Conto Energia I, Conto Energia II linked the incentive program to an objective of
installing a “national target for nominal cumulative photovoltaic power,” now stated to be

3,000 MW by 2016.*? Conto Energia II also fixed a ceiling for the “maximum cumulative

electric power of all power plants that, in accordance with this decree, can obtain the
incentivizing tariffs,” with the ceiling now set at 1,200 MW.** The decree also stated as

follows:

In addition to the power plants that contribute to the achievement of cumulative
electric power referred to in paragraph 1, all power plants entering into operation
within fourteen months after the date, to be communicated by the operator on its
website, on which the limit of power of 1,200 MW referred to in paragraph | is
reached, have a right to the incentivizing tariffs mentioned in Article 6 and the bonus
mentioned in Article 7. The above-mentioned period of fourteen months is extended
to twenty-four months only for those plants owned by public entities.**

In order that the public be able to track the progress towards achieving both the national target
and the incentive ceiling of 1,200 MW established under Conto Energia II, regular updates
were to be published showing the accumulated power of plants that had entered into operation
under Conto Energia I and II.*° Within six months of the 1,200 MW incentive ceiling being
reached, a new decree would be adopted setting out further measures for achieving the

national target.>”

In general, Conto Energia II envisioned that further decrees would be issued every two years
from 2009, setting out the tariffs for plants entering into operation for years after 2010, with
those new tariff levels taking into account, inter alia, “the price trends of energy products and
components for photovoltaic plants,” as well as the results of prior incentive programs,
including the amount of PV energy brought online and the volume of incentives thus far
extended.*® However, in the event that new decrees were not put in place, then the tariffs fixed
by Conto Energia II for power plants coming into operation in 2010 “shall continue to apply

for the years beyond 2010.”

On 23 April 2009, the European Parliament and the Council adopted Directive 2009/28/EC

on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (the “Renewables Directive”),

which replaced the 2001 Directive and imposed mandatory targets on EU Member States for
expansion of renewable energy by the year 2000.*° In Italy’s case, the target imposed for

2020 was that 17% of gross final consumption of energy should be from renewable sources.*!

Recognizing that Member States had different renewable energy potentials and operated
different support schemes to encourage the growth of renewable energy, the Renewables
Directive provided that “[f]or the proper functioning of national support schemes it is vital
that Member States can control the effect and costs of their national support schemes
according to their different potentials.”4 Consequently, it established that “[i]n order to
achieve the targets ... each Member State shall promote and encourage energy efficiency and
energy savings.”*? Moreover, the Renewables Directive provided that the national renewable
energy action plans should “tak[e] into account the effects of other policy measures relating

to energy efficiency on final consumption of energy.”

On 21 January 2010, Italy’s Undersecretary for Economic Development, Mr. Stefano Saglia,
reportedly declared that “the Government’s strategy on energy envisages a stable system of
incentives that will lead to an increase in energy production from renewable sources.”*> On
3-4 May 2010, Undersecretary Saglia attended the 2010 Verona PV Summit and reportedly
declared that the Government intended “to enact by the next meeting of the State-Regions
Conference guidelines for the construction of renewable energy plants and the new
photovoltaic energy bill, in order to give certainty to the entire sector. ... The government
wishes to confirm its commitment to the development of PV energy in Italy hoping to create
investment opportunities, employment and development of a national pipeline, although
foreign investments are certainly welcome.”“° Reports on the same 2010 Summit noted that
the new Conto Energia III was going to “aim at a target of installed capacity of 3,000 MW in

the next three years, but with the availability to take advantage of the tariffs for further 14

months after the target is achieved.”*” Mr. Saglia also reportedly declared that the objective

was to “simplify, but also give [ ] certainty of rules.”**

In the Claimant’s view, these and other statements by the Italian Government were intended

to give assurances to investors in order to encourage investments in Italy’s PV sector.*?

In June 2010, Italy’s Ministry of Economic Development issued the “National Renewable
Action Plan,” reporting on Italy’s plan to fulfill its obligations under the Renewables
Directive.*° The National Action Plan described Italy’s use of a “feed-in tariff’ (“FiT”)
incentive scheme for encouraging the growth of PV power plants, and reported that “[tJhe
current incentive schemes have proved capable of supporting constant growth in the sector,
guaranteeing a sufficient degree of predictability in the return on investment, despite frequent
changes to the regulatory framework, and aiding the financial viability of the projects.”>! The
Plan stated that “[nJevertheless, the strong growth predictions, and in particular the specific
targets for the electricity sector, call for a long-term vision and, as well as rationalizing the
current incentives based on trends in the cost of the various technologies, the ability to
promote benefits in a wider production and employment context, using an approach of gradual
reduction in charges ....”*? The Plan reported that there would therefore be “regular reviews”
of various factors, including specifically of the FiT for solar energy, “in order to take into
account the expected reduction in component and plant costs and to expand the production

base whilst limiting and regulating the economic impact on the electricity sector.”*

The National Action Plan further advised that “[rJegarding the current situation, some

corrections are expected to be introduced to the existing framework ... in order to avoid a

parallel increase in production and in incentive costs.”*+ These include a review of the FiT for
solar plants “in order to avoid excessive or insufficient remuneration,” and a “planned and
progressive reduction of incentives (for example through adjustment according to the
production costs of each technology,” with “advance planning of reductions in tariffs” and
“application of new values only to those plants which come into operation at least one year
after the introduction” of the new values.*° More generally, the Plan described Italy’s

incentive scheme as follows:

The feed-in tariff is a support scheme which guarantees constant remuneration at

current currency values for the electricity produced by plants for a set period of time

(20 years for photovoltaic plants, 25 years for solar thermal plants). Moreover, the

scheme is subject to regular adjustments which take into account the trends in the

prices of energy products and components for photovoltaic plants as well as the

results of monitoring and promoting technology used to create the plants, with the

intention of limiting the medium- and long-term costs to the community. In any case,

the incentive tariff paid when the plant becomes operation[al] remains fixed for the

whole entitlement period.*°
The Plan referred to an upcoming new decree currently awaiting signatures (i.e., the future
Conto Energia III), which would set the national target at 8000 MW of PV capacity to be
installed by 2020,°’ and make various other changes, including a “scheduled decrease” of
FiTs during 2011 and a further 6% annual reduction in 2012 and 2013.°* The third FiT decree
“sets a maximum cap of 3000 MW for the capacity which is eligible for the incentive ....
Once these capacity limits have been reached, the tariff will nonetheless be provided for a
further 14 months (24 months for public bodies).”** Access to these tariffs is “allowed on the
condition that the photovoltaic plants comply with the requirements of the third ‘Feed-In
Tariff’,”® with the tariffs then “paid for a period of 20 years starting from the date on which

the plant becomes operational.”°!

On 7 July 2010, the Ministry of Economic Development issued a press release stating as
follows:
The new Conto Energia for electricity produced by photovoltaic plants starting from
2011 operates a reduction of the incentives, which will have an impact on energy
consumers. Thanks to the reduction on system charges, the electricity bills will be
less expensive. The decree recognizes on energy produced a fixed and guaranteed
incentive tariff for 20 years when the system enters into service in which anyone can
secure (individuals, companies, public bodies, condominiums). For plants that will
commence operations in 2012 and 2013 the incentives will be reduced by 6%. For
subsequent years, it will be issued a new decree.
On 6 August 2010, Italy issued a Ministerial Decree containing “Conto Energia III,” which
was intended to apply to PV plants that entered into operation after 31 December 2010, and
which would enter into effect upon its official publication. In the interim, however — on 13
August 2010 — Italy adopted Law No. 129 (the “Salva Alcoa Act”), “providing for urgent

measures on energy matters.”°+ The Salva Alcoa Act provided as follows:
The incentivising tariffs referred to in Article 6 of [Conto Energia II] ... will be
granted to producers that will complete the construction of the relevant power plants
within the 31* of December 2010, and will communicate the completion of works to
the relevant authorities and Gestore dei Servizi Elettrici - GSE S.p.A. within the

above mentioned deadline, and whose plants enter into operation within the 30" of
June 2011.

The basic effect of the Salva Alcoa Act was to enable certain additional PV plants, which
would be fully constructed by the end of 2010 but not yet entered into operation, to still qualify
for the benefits of Conto Energia II — rather than the terms of the new Conto Energia III — so

long as these plants entered into operation during the first six months of 2011.

On 24 August 2010, Conto Energia III entered into effect with its official publication. As
indicated in the recitals, this Decree acknowledged the evolution of photovoltaic technology
and the reduction of costs, and considered that in light of the basic tariff principle of “fair

remuneration of costs,” tariff levels therefore should be progressively decreased:

Having considered the evolution of the photovoltaic technology achieved after the
date of entry into force of ministerial decree 19 February 2007, and in particular the
reduction of the costs of equipment and photovoltaic systems;

Deemed to intervene in order to adjourn the incentivizing tariffs in light of the
positive reduction of the cost of the photovoltaic technology, and in order to respect
the principle of fair remuneration of costs, established by article 7 of the legislative
decree no. 387 of 2003 and to encourage the innovation and further decrease of costs;

Deemed that the above mentioned reduction of the incentivizing tariffs has to be
implemented through a progressive decrease which, on the one hand, will result ina
progressive alignment towards the current costs of technology and that, on the other,
will maintain stability and certainty in the market ...°7

This new scheme in Conto Energia III provided that “the national target of photovoltaic
cumulative rated power to be installed is 8,000 MW by 2020,”°* and “[t]he capacity of
cumulative electric power of photovoltaic power plants that can receive the incentive rates
provided for in Title II [which covers Articles 7 to 10] of this decree is 3,000 MW.” Progress
towards this ceiling would be published and continually updated,” and once the ceiling of
3,000 MW capacity of total incentivized power was reached, power plants that entered into

operation within the next 14 months would still “have the right to the incentivising tariffs.””!

Conto Energia III provided that plants entering into operation during 2011 would have “the
right to” tariffs set forth in a table which reflected a three-step decrease in rates during the
course of that year; plants entering into operation in 2012 and 2013 would have “the right to”
tariffs that were further reduced by 6% per year.’ A new decree would update rates for plants
that entered into operation after 31 December 2013, failing which the gradual reduction
established for plants entering into operation in 2012 and 2013 would continue to apply.’ As

with Conto Energia II, once a plant entered into operation and thus became entitled to tariffs

at a certain level, those tariffs were “granted for a period of 20 years running from the day on

which the power plant enters into operation.””*

Conto Energia III included a number of requirements to qualify for the incentivizing tariffs,
the most critical of which was that the relevant PV plants should enter into operation.’> This
meant that the plants must be connected to the grid in accordance with the requirements set
forth in Article 2(c) of the decree, by the deadlines established in the decree.’° To be granted
the relevant incentivizing tariffs, the owner had to submit an application to the system operator
within 90 days from entry into operation of the plant, with the operator having 120 days to
decide on the application.” If the incentivizing tariff was granted, then an incentivizing tariff

agreement would be signed, specifying the tariff applicable to the relevant plant for 20 years.”

ESKOSOL’S INVESTMENT

On 21 December 2009, Eskosol was established as an Italian “societa a responsabilita
limitata” by Blusun, a Belgian company which then owned 50% of Eskosol’s equity, and four
Italian nationals (Messrs. Roberto Scognamiglio, Vittorio Sisto, Luigi Dante and Gilberto
Braha), each of whom owned 12.5% of equity.’? Blusun, in turn, is owned by Mr. Jean-Pierre

Lecorcier, a French national, and Mr. Michael Stein, a German national.

Between 18 May and 26 July 2010, Eskosol acquired a 100% shareholding in 12 SPVs, which
in turn held land rights for the construction of PV plants in Italy’s Southern Apulia region.*°
Its plan was to bring into operation a portfolio of 120 PV power plants with an aggregate
power of 120 MW, with each of the plants having a nominal capacity of “just below” 1 MW.
The 1 MW capacity cap was important to Eskosol’s business plan, which sought to take

advantage both of simplified permitting procedures and higher tariff levels available for small

PV plants. At the same time, Eskosol’s plan was to unite these 120 separate 1 MW plants into
a single project for purposes of outside financing, with construction on the power plants

beginning after this financing was arranged.

According to Mr. Scognamiglio, the investors “estimated that constructing these 120 power
plants would require an investment in the region of €380 million to €400 million,” and “[t]he
idea was to finance 80% of the costs of [the] project by way of bank loans (as was normal in
the PV industry in Italy).”*! This investment involved the construction of two medium- to
high-voltage substations, which were necessary for the connection of the future plants to the
electricity grid.*? The permit to build the substations had been obtained on 30 November
2009,*° a contract for the construction of the substations had been signed with Societa
Interconnessioni Brindisi (““SIB”) on 24 February 2010, and construction on the substations
began in April 2010,** shortly before the transactions in which Eskosol acquired its interest

in the 12 SPVs.

Mr. Scognamiglio has testified that Eskosol was established as an “operating company in Italy
that would acquire the 12 SPVs ... and complete the power plants and other needed works.”*>
He stated that “the plan was to buy the 12 SPVs at some point in 2010 and connect the power
plants to the public electricity grid during 2011, to obtain the benefits of a new Conto Energia,
that is, Conto Energia III. ... More specifically, around September/October 2009, it was clear
that Italy was going to issue new legislation,” and that “the specific provisions of Conto
Energia III — eventually issued on 6 August 2010 — were generally known during the first

months of 2010 ...”°°

Mr. Scognamiglio testified that during 2010, including in May of that year, he met with Italy’s

Undersecretary for Economic Development, Mr. Stefano Saglia, “to discuss the Eskosol

Project.” He stated that during these meetings, Undersecretary Saglia “made it very clear to
me that Italy was committed to keeping a stable environment for the investment in the solar
PV sector and that it would not follow Spain’s example. He also said to me that Eskosol

should have no concerns in respect of its planned investment in Italy.”*’

126. On 10 July 2010, the law firm Watson, Farley & Williams produced at Eskosol’s request a
“Due Diligence Report for the 121 MW Puglia Project,” which advised on the regulatory
framework applicable to PV plants in Italy under Conto Energia III as well as on the permits

and authorizations thus far obtained by the 12 SPVs.**
127. On 25 November 2010, Eskosol’s counsel wrote a letter to the GSE as follows:

With regard to the Project, we do believe — and we would like to receive your
confirmation — that if the Project have [sic] the features described below and files a
request to be granted the incentives under the so called Conto Energia between
January and September 2011, you will accept the relevant request:

- The relevant permits are completely legitimate and effective, and their effect has
not been challenged or suspended; being understood that the construction in respect
of the DIAs filed during the period August/September 2008 will be completed within
36 months from the relevant filing.

- The relevant permit are [sic] not vitiated or suspended, and will not be suspended
at the time application for incentives, by the Municipality through an action in self-
defence (“autotutela”) or by the competent administrative Court.

- In addition, the power plants meet all the requirements (also technical), further to
the construction permits, as envisaged to have access to by the Conto Energia.”

128. On26 November 2010, Nico Energia signed, on behalf of itself and the other SPVs owned by
Eskosol, two agreements with the operators of the electricity grid, ENEL and Terna-Rete

Elettrica Nazionale S.p.A. (“Terna”), for the provisional connection of the two substations to

the main electricity grid.°? The construction of the substations was completed in mid-

December 2010.”!

On 3 December 2010, in response to a letter addressed by Claimant’s legal counsel, the GSE

stated as follows:

If the [Eskosol] power plants ..., that is the power plants authorized during the period
August/September 2008, meet all the requirements, also technical as set forth by
applicable law, including the resolutions issued by the Italian Regulatory Authority
for Electricity and Gas (“AEEG”), and save for the case in which the competent
Administrative Body should hold a different interpretation of Article 1 quarter of
Law Decree 105/2010 converted, with amendments, into Law 129/10, we believe
that it is possible to secure access to the incentives set forth in the so-called Conto
Energia, pursuant to the applicable provisions of law.”

On 17 December 2010, Eskosol increased its corporate capital from €10,000 to €7,500,000,”
in connection with Blusun increasing its equity share to 80%, with Messrs. Sisto and
Scognamiglio each retaining a 10% interest.°4 On 29 December 2010, Eskosol was converted

into a joint-stock company (an “S.p.A.”).°°

CONSTRUCTION AND FUNDING OF THE ESKOSOL PLANTS

Up until this point, the two substations had been built to enable the eventual connection of the
future PV plants to the electricity grid, but no construction had yet begun on any of the
contemplated 120 PV plants, for which Eskosol first needed to arrange outside financing and

to conclude an appropriate construction contract.

On 9 November 2010, the WestLB, a German bank, sent a letter to Mr. Stein, one of Blusun’s

shareholders, expressing interest in the financing of up to €40 million of the Eskosol project.

The letter, which was based on the assumption that the project would qualify for the
incentivizing tariffs under Conto Energia III, clarified that:
this letter is not intended to be, and shall not constitute, an offer of financing or a
commitment or undertaking by WestLB to provide or negotiate the terms of any
credit facility in connection with the Project. Any commitment or undertaking by
WestLB to arrange or provide a portion of the financing would be subject to, inter
alia, satisfactory documentation, internal credit approval and satisfactory due

diligence, and subject to such terms and conditions as WestLB may specify in its
absolute discretion.”°

On 29 December 2010, Eskosol signed an engineering, construction and procurement contract
with Siemens for the construction and commissioning of the Eskosol plants (the “EPC

Contract”).”

Eskosol was to procure the solar panels.°*

The EPC Contract provided that the Eskosol plants would be completed and become operable
in three different stages: a first cluster of 30 MW entering into operation by 30 April 2011, a
second cluster of 60 MW entering into operation by 31 August 2011, and a third cluster of 30
MW entering into operation by 15 November 2011.°? As noted in the EPC Contract, the
purpose of these deadlines was for those PV plants to become eligible for the corresponding
subsidies for the relevant periods. '°° For that reason, the EPC Contract foresaw a penalty in

the event that Eskosol was unable to secure the subsidies as a result of a delay by Siemens.!°!

According to Mr. Magli, on 20 January 2011, Eskosol issued the first Notice to Proceed under
the EPC Contract to Siemens.'°* However, on the same day, Eskosol and Siemens signed a

side letter to the EPC Contract, agreeing that:

the “Notice to proceed” for the First Group of Plants will be issued on January 25,
2011 and that the date for the down-payment and the Bank guarantee shall be
extended to February 28, 2011.!°

According to a presentation dated January 2011 by EOS, a consultancy company, Eskosol’s
Project required a €400 million investment, 80% of which would be financed with debt and
20% with equity. This presentation assumed that, should the Eskosol plants qualify for the
incentivizing tariffs under Conto Energia III, the project would generate annual revenues in
the amount of €65 million.'°* According to an Italian business magazine, the Eskosol project

would create the biggest PV power plant in Europe. !°°

On 31 January 2011, UniCredit S.p.A. (“UniCredit”) sent Eskosol a draft term sheet for an
18-year loan to finance the construction of the Eskosol PV plants.!°° The term sheet was
subject inter alia to the delivery of project documents, the completion of financial, technical

and legal due diligence, and an assessment of market conditions. !°”

On 8 February 2011, Eskosol, through its lawyers, sent a letter to UniCredit “confirm[ing its]
interest in conferring to UniCredit S.p.A. ... an exclusive mandate ... to act as arranger and
underwriter in connection with the financing of the development and construction of

photovoltaic projects in Italy with an aggregate nominal capacity equal to 120 MW.”!°8

On 25 February 2011, three days before its first payment to Siemens was due under the side
letter to the EPC Contract, Eskosol sent a letter to Siemens “informing [it that] some financial
issues arose, due also to the uncertainty created by the last communications of GSE, about the
subsidies (‘Conto Energia’) and the subsequent Government decree scheme in approval
phase,” and “ask[ing] for a modification of the payments terms and guaranties contractually

defined.”!°

140. On7 March 2011, Siemens sent a letter to Eskosol stating in relevant part as follows:

Following your request please find a proposal that should grant you the required
support on the project, giving also the opportunity to finalize the maximum number
of sites by end of May 2011.

An acceptable financial schedule might be the following:

1. Full payment of the amount already invoiced by Siemens as down payment by
March 31st 2011 (EUR 4.653.000,00 VAT included). As an alternative payment of
20% of the already invoiced amount (see above) and residual amount covered by
bank guarantees to be delivered by March 31st, 2011.

2. Starting of works for the first 30 MW of plants between April Ist — 15th 2011
(latest), with bank guarantees (in a value of 30% of the overall contractual amount)
to be delivered at latest by April 15th 2011 and payment of the residual amount of
down payment (EUR 3.597.000,00 VAT included). The following milestones
invoicing should be paid according contractual terms [sic].

3. After receiving the relevant Notice to Proceed, starting of works for 60 MW of
plants by May 15th 2011, with the attached down payment and bank guarantees (as
contractually defined)[.]

4. After receiving of the relevant Notice to Proceed, starting of works for the missing
30 MW by the July 15th 2011, with the attached down payment and bank guarantee
(as contractually defined)[.]

In accordance with the contractual provisions ... the EPC Contract has to be
considered suspended by the Contractor at the receiving of this letter.

The acceptance from your side of the above mentioned financial schedule and its
fulfillment has to be considered as condition precedent to restart the EPC Contract."!°

141.  Eskosol did not subsequently make any payment to Siemens pursuant to the EPC Contract.

D. THE ROMANI DECREE
142. On 30 November 2010, the Italian Council of Ministers issued the first draft of the decree on
the implementation of European Directive 2009/28/CE (later to be adopted with changes, and
known as the “Romani Decree”). This draft noted among its “[g]eneral principles” an intent
to “reduc[e] the specific support costs charged to consumers,” while “safeguarding the

investments made and the proportionality to the objectives ... with the purpose of taking into

account the market mechanisms and development of ... technologies.”!!! The Claimant has
not suggested, however, that the first draft of the decree contained major modifications to

Conto Energia III.

On 24 January 2011, the GSE published a Guide to Conto Energia III, with the purpose of
“providing all operators interested in realising photovoltaic power plants an easy and
comprehensive reference work on the regulatory framework and on the procedure to have
access to the incentivising tariff and in relation to relevant premiums, from the phase of
application to the phase of payment of the incentives, as provided [by] the new ministerial

decree 6/08/2010.”!”

At a Senate hearing held on 25 January 2011, the GSE noted that “the growth of photovoltaic
power plants has been too rapid.”!! The GSE highlighted as follows:

e The aggregate nominal capacity of plants realized, even if not connected to the grid,
at the end of 2010 may have reached approx. 7,000 MW based on 200,000 plants;

¢ Once into operation, the above mentioned plants will accrue burdens over the A3
fee equal to 3 billion euro, each year for 20 years;

¢ To the end of 2011 it will be reached the target of 8,000 MW, nine years in arrears,
set forth by the National Plan;

« We suggest to consider a reduction on the capacity to be incentivised, by providing
new targets for photovoltaic power plants for 2020 as well as a reduction of the
incentivising tariffs for power plants which will enter into operation in next coming
years, by reducing the incentives set forth by DM 6.8.2010 for the years 2012 and
2013.114
According to the Claimant, “[tJhe assertions made by GSE on 25 January 2011 before the
Italian Senate (‘the 8,000 MW target that the National Action Plan ... set for the year 2020
for photovoltaic plants, might be reached towards the end of 2011”) and other Italian agencies

on the ‘excessive’ growth of the PV sector, were incorrect. In fact, by February 2011, only

approximately 3,730 MW of PV capacity under Conto Energia I, II and III had been connected
to the grid.”!!> Indeed, according to another document from the GSE, the installed capacity

of PV plants that entered into operation under Conto Energia III in 2011 was 1,552 MW.!!°

However, according to the International Energy Agency, while the 2020 target of PV installed
capacity under Conto Energia III was 8 GW (i.e., 8,000 MW), the installed capacity by the
end of 2011 reached about 13 GW. !!7

The Respondent emphasizes that, in addition to the dramatic and rapid increase of PV installed
capacity in 2011 (with a corresponding sharp increase in public spending on incentives), there
was also a significant decrease in the costs associated with PV plants, resulting in
unexpectedly high profitability levels for plant operators compared to those in earlier years. !!8
The Claimant has not disputed that the cost of PV technology significantly declined in this

period.

On 7 February 2011, an Italian newspaper reported that the Italian Government had warned,
in the report on market conditions sent to the Italian Parliament, of the risks of reaching the
national photovoltaic target for 2020 years ahead of schedule in 2013, and the ensuing

excessive costs to be borne by Italian consumers. !!?

On 17 February 2011, the Italian Senate approved a second draft of the decree on the
implementation of European Directive 2009/28/CE.!”° The Claimant has not suggested that

this second draft contained major changes regarding Conto Energia III.

On 28 February 2011, Italy’s Minister for Economic Development, Mr. Paolo Romani,

reportedly stated that the Government needed to stop the incentive-based mechanism for

promoting renewable energies, because such incentives had “cost the Italian people 20 billion

euros between 2000 and 2010.”!7!

151. On the same date, the Italian Government published a third draft of the decree on the
implementation of European Directive 2009/28/CE.'” This draft included the following new

provision:

Article 7 of legislative decree no. 387/03 will be in force until 1 January 2014; if the
specific objective for the solar photovoltaic sector, set at 8,000 MW by 2020 as part
of the National Action Plan referred in article 3, is reached ahead of time, according
to article 3 of decree of economic development 6 August 2010, published on [sic]
the Official Gazette no. 197 of 24 August 2010, the grant of incentives for further
production of energy from solar PV sources shall be suspended until a decree issued
by the Minister for Economic Development (to be made in consultation with the
Minister for Environment and Sea Protection, after consulting the Unified
Conference) sets out the new policy objectives and the relevant modalities, also in
light of the provisions of article 33, paragraph 5-bis. The previous provision shall not
apply to plants referred in Title III and IV of the same Decree 6 August 2010.!73

152. According to the Claimant, this provision “effectively dispensed with the 14-month
guaranteed access period envisaged in Conto Energia III.”!?4 The Respondent disagrees with
this characterization, noting that the 14-month grace period mentioned in Conto Energia III
referred to a time after 3,000 MW of capacity had received the Conto Energia III incentives
(which the Respondent contends had not been triggered), rather than to a time after the total
national PV target of 8,000 MW had been met, which is what the new Romani Decree

provision addresses. !?°

153. In any event, the third draft of the decree gave rise to significant criticism, including by one
of the rapporteurs of EU Directive 28/2009/EC, Mr. Claude Turmes, who noted that this

constituted a “gift made to the nuclear lobby” and that it was “likely to cause the demise of

hundreds of businesses and [the loss of] thousands of jobs, starting with the photovoltaic
sector.”!7° Mr. Turmes suggested that the Government:
must eliminate the suspension of incentives in [Conto Energia III] when 8,000 MW
are reached and guarantee the continuity of the market ... A feasible option consists
of adjusting the tariffs for [solar] photovoltaic [energy], and renewable [energy] in
general, permanently (and not every 2 or 3 years) in light of different parameters

such as Europe-wide costs trends of individual technologies, the price of kWh in
respect of electricity and gas in respect of thermal. '?”

On 3 March 2011, the Italian Government adopted Legislative Decree No. 28 (also known as
the “Romani Decree”), which was the final version of its decree on the implementation of
European Directive 2009/28/CE. '** The stated purpose of the Romani Decree was to “define
[] the tools, mechanisms, incentives and institutional, financial and legal framework,
necessary to achieve the objectives until 2020 in matters of the overall share of energy from
renewable sources.”!?? The Romani Decree noted that the production of renewable energy
was to be encouraged on the basis of certain general criteria, including “ensuring a fair return

on investment and operating costs.”!*°

The Romani Decree provided that the incentivizing tariff established by Conto Energia III
would apply to the production of electricity generated by solar PV power plants that entered
into operation by 31 May 2011.!?! The electricity generated by solar PV plants that enter into
operation after 31 May 2011 would be “governed by a decree from the Minister for Economic
Development to be adopted ... [by] 30 April 2011.”'3? Without anticipating the precise
conditions and levels of the tariffs to be offered under the new decree, the Romani Decree
provided that they would be based upon the following principles:

a) determination of a maximum annual cumulative electric power from
photovoltaic plants that can get the incentive rates;

b) the incentivising tariff is to be determined taking into account the reduction in
the costs of the technology and power plants and those to the incentives applied
by other Members States of the European Union;

c

determination of incentive rates and differentiated quotas according to the nature
of the ground area;

d) application of provisions of Article 7 of Legislative Decree of 29 December 2003
no. 387, if [they] are compatible with this paragraph.'°

Thus, the Romani Decree anticipated the early end of Conto Energia III and the coming into
force instead of a new and different Conto Energia IV. It also eliminated the grace period that
Conto Energia III had extended, for plants entering into operation within 14 months after a

ceiling of 3,000 MW capacity of total incentivized power had been reached.

Separately, the Romani Decree set out new restrictions regarding the availability of
incentivizing tariffs for PV plants built on small parcels of agricultural land, albeit subject to
a transitional mechanism before the new rules would come into effect. Prior to the Romani
Decree, PV plants were eligible for the tariffs so long as they occupied no more than 50% of
the agricultural parcel of land on which they were built. In January of 2011, however, the GSE
acknowledged the importance of “protect[ing] agricultural land” and “preventing the
excessive diffusion of large photovoltaic power stations which take up large areas of land,”
by directing incentives “mostly to the photovoltaic plant built into roofs and structures.” !*4
The ensuing Romani Decree therefore provided that beginning one year from its entry into
force (i.e., by 31 March 2012), tariffs under the forthcoming Conto IV regime would be
available to plants built on agricultural land only if they occupied no more than 10% of the

parcel available to the applicant and had capacity between 200 kW and 1 MW.!*>

The Romani Decree was criticized by some associations and politicians. These included the
Association of Foreign Banks in Italy, which noted that it “place[d] many of the projects
already financed and set to be disbursed at risk of default.”'*° It also included politicians from
southern Italy, who noted that it “endanger[ed] thousands of jobs” and endangered

investments underway.!*7

The Romani Decree was also criticized at the sessions held by the Italian Parliament on 14
and 15 March 2011, with some members of Parliament noting, inter alia, that the Romani
Decree created a legal vacuum with respect to power plants entering into operation after 31
May 2011, that the time needed for plants to connect to the grid ranged between 70 and 150
days, that some banks had announced the suspension of foreseen funding, and that some
companies were at risk of losing their investments. '** Other members of the Italian Parliament
noted, inter alia: (i) the risk that postponing the determination of the new incentivizing tariffs
would lead to the blocking of investments underway; (ii) that the change undermined the
rights of investors that had not factored in unexpected changes to the legal framework; (ii)
that the Romani Decree “change[d], retrospectively, the rules, setting tight deadlines which

are incompatible with the realization of the capacity already authorized”; and (iv) that given

4. As of the date of entry into force of this decree, solar photovoltaic power plants with modules placed on
land in agricultural areas, may access the State incentives provided that, in addition to the requirements set
out in Annex 2:

a) the nominal power of each power plant is not greater than 1 MW and, in respect of parcels of land that
belong to the same owner, the power plants are situated at a distance of no less than two kilometres;

b) no more than 10 per cent of the surface of the agricultural parcel of land that is available to the applicant
is earmarked for the construction of the power plants.

Deputy D. Piffari’s Motion 1-00594, 14 March 2011, C-70, which reads as follows:

[Pursuant to the Romani Decree] the “rewards” of Conto Energia III on photovoltaic [energy generation],
which were meant to last at least from 2011 to 2013, will apply only to power plants connected to the grid
by 31 May 2011. After that, the new incentives will apply. As a result, we are witnessing a sort of a legal
vacuum that concerns all the power plants that connect to the grid after 31 May 2011; today, indeed, the
time needed for a small PV power plant to connect [to the national grid] is around 70 working days, a period
which is around 150 working days for more complex structures. It is completely unclear whether those who
have approved projects, financed or in progress, would be able to be profitable after 31 May 2011. This is
why it has been said that this cut is “retroactive” and unconstitutional; banks have already announced the
suspension of foreseen funding and many companies have suddenly found themselves at risk of losing their
investments, a circumstance that affects thousands of jobs and prevents the creation of new job opportunities
(it has been reported today that, at present, in Italy, one of each three new jobs created relates to the green
economy|.]

the absence of legislation for the period after 31 May 2011, those who had already obtained
permits to realize and commission photovoltaic plants were at risk of not being able to have

access to the credit market or to do so only under onerous terms. !*°

160. On 15 April 2011, the Vice-President of the European Commission in Charge of Energy, Mr.

Giinther Oettinger, wrote a letter to Minister Romani noting the following:

The changes regarding incentives for renewable energy that affect directly or
indirectly the on-going investments concern the investors, whether national or
international. The consequences of such amendments arouse my concern.

With Directive 2009/28/CE, the European Union has undertaken to increase the
percentage of renewable energy, by establishing national mandatory fixed thresholds
to be reached within 2020. Thanks to this strategy we could mitigate the climate
change, improve the energy procurement and promote the industrial development.

Italy is required to reach the quota of 17% of the gross final consumption of
electricity from renewable energy within 2020. As set forth in National Action Plan
for the renewable energy, in order to meet such requirement it is envisaged a
significant increase of the internal production as well as the import from abroad,
pursuant to the cooperation mechanism established by the above mentioned
Directive. Therefore, it appears crucial that the Italian Government establishes a
clear, stable and predictable incentives system, aimed at guaranteeing the
development of renewables, without the risk that the necessary investment being
postponed and become more expensive, preventing the achievement of the above
mentioned target.

In the recent Communication “Renewable Energy: Progressing towards the 2020
target,” the Commission has highlighted the problems arising out from the recent
reforms, recognizing the need to support the development of the technology and to
provide incentives proportionate to the decreasing costs of the renewable
investments. The amendments which modify the financial return of the existing
projects may violate the national and European general principles and, above all,
may jeopardize the stability of the investments in the industry, with potential
repercussions on the economic upturn.

Therefore I would like to kindly invite you to make all efforts in order to implement
Directive 2009/28/CE in a stable and predictable manner and to be prudent when
considering legislative measures that may have repercussions on the investments
already made. My offices will be happy to further discuss the subject matter and
assist you. 4°

E. CONTO ENERGIA IV

161.

162.

163.

On 12 May 2011, the Italian Government enacted Decree of 5 May 2011 (also known as
“Conto Energia IV”). !4!

According to the recitals of the decree, in issuing Conto Energia IV, the Government took

into consideration, inter alia, the following:

... that the promotion of the production of electricity through photovoltaic plants entering
into operation after the 31‘ of May 2011 has to be implemented by means of a gradual
reduction of the tariffs which, on one hand, will tend to align the public aid with the relevant
cost of the technology in line with the politics adopted by the main European states and,
on the other, will ensure stability and certainty of the market;

... that, based on the evolution of technology costs, the grid parity, that is the economic
convenience of the energy generated through photovoltaic compared to other sources, will
be met in [a] few years, which will result in incentives not [being] needed;

... [that incentives should] allow[] investors and the industry to grow through the years,
with a less impact on electricity bills;

... that, on the basis of existing provisions for photovoltaic and data support on the
investments made and in progress, the burden of the system’s costs the electricity sector
[sic] should reach, by 2011, around 3.5 billion annually.” !4?

On this basis, Conto Energia IV established a gradual reduction of the incentivizing tariffs
available for photovoltaic plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011, with plants
entering into operation in June 2011 receiving a higher incentive than those entering into
operation in March 2012.'** The reduction in the tariffs offered under Conto Energia IV has

been represented in the Claimant’s Memorial as follows: '4+

164. Conto Energia IV continued to provide that any particular tariff level, applicable to a given
plant based on the date of its entry into operation, would remain constant for that plant for 20

years. 45

165. Article 6 of Conto Energia IV established the following conditions to access the incentivizing

tariffs:

2. The large plants that will enter into operations by August 31, 2011 will have
directly access incentive rates, subject to the duty to notify GSE the entry into
operation within 15 days after that date.

3. For the years 2011 and 2012, large plants that do not fall in those referred to in
paragraph 2 access to incentive rates if the following additional conditions occur:

a) the plant is listed in the register under Article 8, in such a position as to match the
specific cost limits defined for each reference period referred to in Article 4,
paragraph 2. The cost limit for 2011 includes the costs related to the incentives
granted in favour of the large plants that have come into operation by 31 August
2011. If the whole cost of incentive for large plants that have come into operation by
31 August 2011 and of the cost of the incentives granted in favour of the plants
enrolled in the register referred to in Article 8 for the year 2011 exceeds the limit
estimated for the same period, the excess leads to a reduction by the same amount of
the cost limit for the second half of 2012;

b) the certification of completion of the plant is received by GSE within seven
months after the date of publication of the list referred to in Article 8, paragraph 3;
this period is extended to nine months a new mechanism for plants whose capacity
exceeds 1 MW.

4, In all cases, the applicable incentivizing tariff is the one in force on the date when
the plant entered into operation. '“°

166. One of the main changes under Conto Energia IV was that “large plants” (such as Eskosol’s)

had to enroll in a registry kept by the GSE. The registry established certain “priority criteria,”

favoring plants that had entered into operation on the date of their application for registration,
followed by those for which construction work was finished and those which had simply
received certain authorizations. If the certificate of works completion for the plants listed in
the GSE’s registry was not produced by the applicable deadline, the registration of the relevant

plant lapsed.'47

The Respondent emphasizes that Italy’s domestic courts have systematically rejected
contentions that Conto Energia IV had retroactive effect. Italy cites, by way of example, the
Administrative Court of Lazio, according to which “access to the incentives is not tied to the
mere possession of the administrative authorization to build the plant (which is just an
essential prerequisite),” but rather they are “granted upon the commissioning of the plant ...,
when a plant is actually built and commissioned.”'** In the court’s view, the “distinction
anchored to the date of commissioning of the plant is adequately justified by the

characteristics of the incentive system in question,” which “reflects the difference between

47 Conto Energia IV, CL-100, Art. 8:

1. For the years 2011 and 2012 the person in charge of large plants must apply to [the] GSE for being listed
in the appropriate register, sending the documentation described in Annex 3-A.

2. For 2011, applications must be received by GSE from 20 May to 30 June 2011. For the same year, the
period for being listed in the register is re-opened, in case of additional availability under the cost limit
referred to in Article 4, paragraph 2, from September 15 to September 30, 2011. For the first half of 2012,
the period for registration is from Ist to 30th November 2011 and is subsequently reopened, in case of
further availability within the cost limit referred to in Article 4, paragraph 2, from | to 31 January 2012. For
the second half of 2012 the registration period goes from | to 28 February 2012 and is subsequently
reopened, in case of further availability within the cost limit referred to in Article 4, paragraph 2 from 1 to
31 May 2012, in view of the provisions of article 6, paragraph 3, letter a) third sentence.

3. GSE prepares the list of the systems enrolled in the register and publishes it on its website within fifteen
days after the closing date, according to the following priority criteria, to be applied in a hierarchical order:
a) plants that have entered into operation on the submission date of the application for registration;

b) plants in which the construction works were finished on the submission date of the application for
registration; in this case, subject to the provisions in Article 9;

c) priority based on the date of the relevant authorization;

d) lower nominal capacity;

e) priority based on the date of the application for being listed in the register.

4. If, for a plant enrolled in position to match the cost limits set out in Article 4, paragraph 2, the certificate
of works completion has been not produced before the deadline specified in Article 6, paragraph 1, letter b),
the registration of the same plant elapses. If, anyway, the plant is completed and qualifies, in a subsequent
period, for the incentive rates in the manner and within the limits laid down in this decree, it is entitled to
the rate in force on the date of entry into operation less 20%.

commissioning.”!”

168. On 29 July 2011 and 16 September 2011, the GSE published a list of plants eligible to receive

feed-in tariffs subject to the timely completion of their works. The lists included 113 of the
Claimant’s plants.'*° Pursuant to Conto Energia IV, in order to qualify for the incentivizing
tariffs, the plants had to be completed no later than seven months after the GSE’s publication

of the lists, i.e. by the end of February 2012.'*!

F. THE ESKOSOL PROJECT AFTER THE ROMANI DECREE AND CONTO ENERGIA IV

169. According to the Claimant’s witnesses, the uncertainty created by the Romani Decree and the

reduction in tariffs resulting from Conto Energia IV, which made the Eskosol project

t,!52 and

“economically unviable,” prevented Eskosol from securing funding for the project
thus proceeding with the Siemens EPC Contract under which construction essentially had

been predicated on Eskosol’s first obtaining outside funding.

170. The same witnesses also explained that Eskosol tried to save the project by offering

subcontractors the possibility of building 60 power plants, with a total capacity of 60 MW, to
be paid after the plants were connected to the grid. Eskosol’s efforts were unsuccessful.

According to Mr. Magli:

Eskosol approached local subcontractors to try to reach a deal so they would build
these 60 power plants in exchange for payments after the power plants were

tariffs in Conto Energia IV, especially in respect of the tariffs for the end of 2011, was extremely detrimental to the
viability of the Eskosol Project, particularly given the need to bear the significant costs of the whole infrastructure
required for the Eskosol Project.”); see also Magli I, 4] 40-42 (“In our case, the Romani Decree ultimately killed the

decree significantly reduced the FiT in comparison to the ones applicable under Conto Energia III and, unlike Conto

was possible.'*3

171. On 16 December 2011, Siemens sent a letter to Eskosol communicating its decision to
terminate the EPC Contract. That letter read in relevant part as follows:

Reference is made to our communication dated March 07th 2011 ... under which ...
we were forced to suspend the EPC contract ....

Unfortunately we have to ascertain that, in the following months, it was not possible
from your side to confirm us these financial and contractual conditions or alternatives
that would ensure the sustainable implementation of the EPC contract.

We therefore inform you about our decision to terminate the EPC contract
(suspended since last March) for reasons not attributable to us, as from the fifteenth
day after receipt of this letter.'%4

172. Subsequently, the GSE sent a letter to Mr. Lecorcier communicating that “the Responsible
Party didn’t submit, within the provided deadline, the completion certificate,” and that “this
leads to the revocation of the enrollment to the ‘large Plant’ Register.” According to the same
letter from the GSE, 269 other plants with a capacity up to 1 MW had been connected to the

grid and had qualified for the incentivizing tariffs. !°°

173. On 20 July 2012, Mr. Magli filed a request seeking the bankruptcy of Eskosol in respect of a
debt of €2.082 million, mostly related to the sale of his rights in Nico Energia, J&P and Electra
(3 of the 12 SPVs) to Eskosol.!*°

174. On 18 December 2012, Eskosol’s shareholders agreed to wind up the company, and Mr.

Lecorcier was appointed as Eskosol’s liquidator. '57

175. On 12 November 2013, Eskosol was declared insolvent by a Brindisi court, which appointed
Mr. Teodoro Contardi as receiver.'** According to the Claimant, Blusun and Messrs.

Lecorcier and Stein thereafter failed to cooperate with Eskosol’s bankruptcy proceedings.

planned PV projects in Italy are approximately €39.2 million.!°!

G. ESKOSOL’S BUSINESS PLAN

177.

178.

179.

The Parties’ respective positions differ with respect to the appropriateness of Eskosol’s

business plan.

According to Italy, the failure of the Eskosol project was the result of Eskosol’s own
entrepreneurial choices, and in particular its decision to defer any construction work on PV
plants until late in the project. By contrast, Italy notes that “269 plants comparable to those of
the Claimant [] (i.e., below 1 MW), entered the ranking and were indeed completed within

that period.”

Italy states that “Claimant’s decision to prioritize the work on the grid, rather than proceeding
at the time with the construction of the plants, was easily the single most important reason for
missing out on the incentives available in 2010 and until June 2011.”!® It also explains that
“the statement that without an STMD, no bank would finance the Project finds no
correspondence in the clauses indicated by Unicredit’s Term Sheet, where the bank requires
the STMD or the DIL for the grid connection deposited in July 2010.”'%* Eskosol chose to

postpone the construction of the plants “to the last possible moment, in order to cash in on the

constantly decreasing cost of solar panels.”!® Italy also notes that Eskosol signed the EPC
Contract with Siemens before arranging its outside financing. In Italy’s view, “[tJhe
timeframe and the regulatory environment cannot be blamed for the Claimant’s central failure

to do the only indispensable thing: acquire enough funds to make the Project viable.”!%

180. Italy depicts Eskosol as a “developer” or “promoter,” whose plan was to sell a “paper project”

or, alternatively, to sell the project to final investors or to final takers after completion of the
two substations, but before actually constructing the PV plants.'®’ It argues that “the
Claimant’s hope was that the tariffs would guarantee an extra-reward on capital, such that the
Project could still be appealing to an institutional investor even after deducing the profits for
the promoter/developer’s premium.”!®* Yet no investor agreed to fund the project. The
Respondent notes that Eskosol did not explain why its informal exchange with West LB was
not explored further. Regarding Unicredit, Italy argues that “[a]t a critical juncture, Claimant
simply failed to convince the Unicredit Syndicate, its only possible partner, to inject urgently
a substantial amount of money into a speculative project that, in several respects, was over-
exposed to business risks, and that was just weeks away from entering disastrous financial
troubles.”!® In Italy’s view, “[i]nstitutional investors ... were wary and careful to monitor
profitability differentials existing across countries. As the margin of profit estimated in Italy
was decreasing, it could not be expected that investors would rush to fund a massive project,

like that of the Claimant, which was planned during the adjustment phase, and would become

operational much later in time.”!”°

panels was decreasing due to technological progress, it was rational to wait for as long as possible before building the

to final investors rapidly. In the meantime, Mr. Dante was looking for debt investors to finance the project’s
development in the short- and medium-term. In this context, Mr. Lecorcier and I were the ideal partners for
Oikonomia. We had funds available to invest in advancing the project to a point where it would be attractive to
institutional investors,” R-49, ff] 43-44).

The Claimant rejects Italy’s criticism of its business plan. First, it contends that “[t]o qualify
for incentives, PV plants have to be both built and operational; and the substations and cables
had to be built and connected for Eskosol’s PV plants to operate!”!”! Eskosol also suggests
that ENEL required Eskosol to connect its PV plants to the public grid through two substations
in the first place.'”” Having the electrical infrastructure built and authorized made commercial
sense, since obtaining the permits and building that infrastructure takes much longer, and is
more risky, than building the PV power plants themselves.'”> The Claimant contends that its
business plan was also justified because “Claimant saved money by waiting to construct the
plants until after the connection work was complete. In 2010, the price of solar panels began
to decrease ‘due to technological progress.’”'”* Eskosol further notes that “obtaining the
STMD from ENEL was a ‘condition precedent’ for securing the loan” from Unicredit.!7>
Eskosol’s experts also advance reasons related to savings on operation and maintenance,
module warranty and module degradation, all of which would be achieved by building the PV

plants only once the infrastructure was in place.!7°

In Eskosol’s view, the fact that Mr. Bacchiocchi (Italy’s witness) admitted that Eskosol’s
Project had the same technical features as another project which went forward (the Blasi-
Casignano project) refutes Italy’s position that the project was defective in its technical

design, or that Eskosol exposed itself to too much risk.'7”

Eskosol also explains that the project needed to be large because there was no infrastructure

in the region to connect the plants to the grid, and therefore the substations were required. '7*

Eskosol contends that the project was financially viable under Conto Energia III, citing the

term sheet Eskosol received from Unicredit on 31 January 2011.'” It notes that it hired

sophisticated legal and financial consultants, and retained one of the top contractors for the
final leg of the project.'* It also noted that receiving financing for 80% of the project was
normal for solar PV projects, '*! and that by the time it applied for construction financing “it
had eliminated nearly all regulatory risk because it had obtained nearly all necessary permits
required for the infrastructure, the construction, and the connection of its PV plants.”!*?
Eskosol argues that Professor Delfanti (Italy’s expert) contradicted Italy’s position that the
PV plants should have been built in parallel with the substations, and that both Parties’ experts
actually agree that deferring construction of the PV plants until after completion of the
substations and a significant portion of the medium voltage grid could not possibly have

caused the collapse of the project. !*

Indeed, Eskosol argues that “no bank was likely to finalize the construction financing for the
PV Plants until the underlying infrastructure was purchased, installed, tested and approved by
the government.”!** In Eskosol’s view, “there is ample proof that Eskosol would have
obtained all necessary financing to complete its Project” under an alternative approach.'*>
Moreover, Eskosol says that its shareholders, Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein, had paid €16.9
million in cash to fund the project, and that its total sunk costs were much higher. It also notes
Dr. Stickel’s statement at the Hearing that “bridge financing and equity investors were readily

available in the market place.”'*°

According to Eskosol, it “needed ... time to complete the due diligence process required to
obtain the bank financing, which it clearly had under the timelines established under CE III
... However, instead of having ample time to obtain the needed financing, Eskosol had to

cope with the fact that Minister Romani tore down CE III abruptly.”!*” Eskosol “urge[s] the

VI. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

188. The Tribunal has addressed issues of jurisdiction and admissibility in two prior decisions in

this case: its 20 March 2017 Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, and its 7 May 2019 Decision
on Termination. The latter decision conclusively resolved Italy’s jurisdictional objection
based on inapplicability of the ECT to intra-EU disputes. The former decision did not
conclusively resolve any objections to jurisdiction or admissibility, but expressed certain
preliminary views on several objections, in the course of rejecting Italy’s request that the
Tribunal dismiss Eskosol’s claims for manifest lack of legal merit under ICSID Rule 41(5).
Italy has now chosen to pursue some (but not all) of its original objections, and as to these,
the Tribunal accepts that its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection does not resolve the issues, as
that Decision necessarily was preliminary in nature. The Parties have since presented further
arguments on the relevant objections, as was their procedural right. The Tribunal turns in this
section to their principal contentions regarding the remaining jurisdictional and admissibility

objections in this case.

189. By way of background, Eskosol states that it satisfies the jurisdictional requirements under

both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the ECT. First, it contends that this proceeding
concerns a legal dispute over Italy’s violation in 2011 of its obligations under the ECT and
international law.'°° Second, it says that the dispute arises directly out of qualifying
investments under both the ICSID Convention and Articles 1(5), 1(6) and 1(10) of the ECT,
namely: (i) its land rights; (ii) its rights to the Eskosol grid; (iii) its 100% shareholding in the

SPVs; (iv) the entitlement to use the substations; (v) its rights under the EPC Contract; (vi)
its rights under the agreements for the acquisition of the SPVs; (vii) its officers’ intellectual
creations for the purposes of the Eskosol project; and (viii) its entitlement to permits,
authorizations and licences obtained from different Italian authorities. '°! Third, Eskosol states
that it is a qualifying investor under Article 1(7) of the ECT, as the dispute involves an ICSID
Member State (Italy) and a national of a juridical person “as to which there is an agreement
that it be treated as a national of another ICSID Contracting State.” Indeed, Eskosol notes
that, by signing the ECT, Italy and Belgium (which is the state of incorporation of Blusun, the
holder of 80% of the Eskosol’s shares) agreed in Article 26(7) as follows:

An Investor other than a natural person which has the nationality of a Contracting

Party to the dispute on the date of the consent [to arbitration] and which, before a

dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises, is controlled by Investors of

another Contracting Party, shall for the purposes of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention be treated as a ‘national of another Contracting State’ ...'°?

Pursuant to this provision of the ECT, Eskosol contends that it should be treated as “a national

of another Contracting State” for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICISD Convention. '!*

Finally, Eskosol states that it sent a notice of dispute to the Italian Government in accordance
with Article 26(2) of the ECT and consented to arbitration, pursuant to Article 26(3) and (4)
of the ECT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, through its Request for Arbitration. '**

In the wake of the Tribunal’s Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, Italy pursued two objections
in addition to the intra-EU objection which the Tribunal subsequently denied. First, it
advanced a jurisdictional objection based on Eskosol’s alleged failure to satisfy the nationality
requirements of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(7) of the ECT.
Second, Italy advanced an admissibility objection grounded on res judicata and abuse of

rights allegations, based on the relationship between Eskosol’s claims in this case and those

brought by Blusun and subsequently denied by the tribunal in the Blusun case. Italy’s

objections and Eskosol’s position on these objections are summarized in turn below.

A. JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

Italy argues that “[i]n the context of ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal must be satisfied that its
jurisdiction is granted both under the ICSID Convention and under the specific instrument of
consent invoked by the investor.”!** It contends that Eskosol did not satisfy, at the critical
times, the requirements of foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention
and Article 26(7) of the ECT, which in its view are cumulative and warrant separate

analysis. !°°

1. Nationality Requirement under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention
a. Italy’s position
Italy argues that investors that have the nationality of the host State at the time of registration
of their Request for Arbitration do not fall under the Centre’s jurisdiction ratione materiae.
Exceptionally, Article 25(2)(b) provides for the possibility that domestic companies may
bring a claim against their host State, but stipulates two requirements: that “the investor must
be controlled ‘by foreign investors’ of the home State, and the Parties must have agreed that
such control qualifies the investor for protection as if it had foreign nationality.”!®” Italy notes
that Article 25 does not specify the point in time at which foreign control must exist, but
contends that it should be interpreted to require foreign control at the date of consent to
arbitration, which is considered to be the date of registration by ICSID of the arbitration

request.

Italy accepts that Article 26(7) of the ECT records an agreement between Italy and Belgium
regarding foreign control, but contends as a matter of fact that “there was no foreign control

of the Claimant at the relevant time.” !°*

195. Inits view, “[i]f the parties indicated foreign control as a qualifying element, a different — and
looser — notion, like foreign shareholding, will not suffice. Exceptions cannot be interpreted
extensively.”!%? To this effect, Italy invokes the treaty interpretive principles of Article 31 of
the VCLT, which it says “includes taking into account the default treaty regime from which
the exceptions derogate. The default rule (foreign citizenship is required) cannot be waived
by extending the exception (foreign control) beyond its literal meaning.””°° According to
Italy, “[s]ince Article 26(7) of the ECT requires ‘foreign control,’ anything short of objective
foreign control will not suffice to trigger the circumstances envisaged by the ECT parties.”
Indeed, Italy argues that “even if the agreement between the ECT parties were to require
anything less stringent than actual foreign control, it could not override the specific
requirement in Article 25(2)(b) ICSID. ... The element of foreign control under Article
25(2)(b) must be factually demonstrated.”?°!

196. Italy considers that:

[t]he idea of formal control is a contradiction in terms in the framework of Article
25(2)(b) ICSID because the ‘foreign control’ element operates precisely to pierce the
veil of formal nationality and reach for the reality of effective control. In short, non-
objective control is just not control.?°

197. In support of its proposition on the need for an objective test for foreign control, Italy relies

on the decisions rendered in National Gas,?? TSA,?* and Vacuum Salt.? Italy rejects

Eskosol’s attempt to distinguish the TSA decision on the factual grounds that the claimant in

that case had been controlled by an Argentinian national ail the time. Italy says that its reliance

foreign control is a complex question requiring the examination of several factors such as equity participation, voting
rights and management. In order to obtain a reliable picture, all these aspects must be looked at in connection. There
is no simple mathematical formula based upon shareholding or votes alone.” (Memorial on Jurisdiction, § 49, citing
C. Schreuer, 12 ICSID REV.- FOR. INV'T L. J. 59, 79-80 (1997), 126).

on TSA is to the effect that “foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) ICSID must be real and
material, objectively identifiable and not merely presumed. This point is one on the law, about
the nature of control (actual rather than presumed),” and the point cannot be defeated simply
by distinguishing TSA on the facts, “on an aspect that did not concern the nature of foreign

control.”20°

Italy argues that Eskosol misunderstood its statement that “Article 26(7) ECT ... is open-
ended” and “thus contains no agreement, and can raise no presumption of foreign control,
with respect to Eskosol or any other specific company.”?”” Italy says that the emphasis in this
quote should be on the words “with respect to Eskosol or any other specific company,” given
that “[iJn most ... cases cited in support of the ‘ownership implies control’ theory, the
agreement required under Article 25(2)(b) ICSID was contained in a contract, to which the
individual company that was to be treated as foreign was a party. Of course, in such
circumstances, the presumption that the host State had considered the control structure of the
contracting company is reasonable, and its express willingness to treat that company as

foreign enjoys a presumption of validity.”?°

According to Italy, “[t]he issue in the present case is whether Italy and Belgium, and all the
parties to the ECT, have agreed at all to consider any foreign-owned company to be controlled
by foreign investors by reason of foreign shareholding alone. This is clearly not the case, and
there are no presumptions to rebut. The simple question is whether, in the case at hand, the
local company could demonstrate ... having been controlled by foreign investors at the critical

time. If not, there is no agreement for the purpose of Article 25(2)(b).”?

Italy argues that while shareholding is typically a relevant factor to establish control, it is not
always a reliable benchmark to be taken as conclusive in isolation. In support of this, Italy

relies on Vattenfall, LETCO and AES, three cases where the investors appear to have provided

evidence of actual control in addition to their shareholding in the relevant companies.?!°

Indeed, Italy says that “there can be ownership without control.”?!!

201. Italy also relies on the award in Guardian Fiduciary, where the tribunal held that “the issue

of control is ... ultimately a matter of evidence and cannot be determined solely on the basis

212

of an analysis of the applicable New Zealand law, and where the tribunal found no

evidence that the claimant’s shareholders exercised actual control.7!

202. Italy contends that even if Eskosol could convince the Tribunal that parties in principle could
derogate from the actual foreign control requirement of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention, that would not assist Eskosol in this case, because there is no such agreement. In
fact, according to Italy, the ECT imposed a stricter requirement on foreign control ratione

temporis.?'* Italy notes that, at the time of consent,

[t]he existence of the present proceedings, after all, is the result of the non-foreign
controller (the court-appointed receiver) acting in name of the Claimant (recte: of its
creditors) to launch arbitration. At some earlier point, the Belgian shareholders did
indeed possess and exercise control over the Claimant. Indeed, one of the last
relevant managerial decisions taken by them was precisely to consciously relinquish
control, by triggering bankruptcy proceedings that led to receivership.7!°

203. Italy rejects Eskosol’s argument that Blusun’s shareholding would be devoid of meaning or
content, if Eskosol were to be deemed no longer controlled by Blusun simply by virtue of its
entry into receivership. In Italy’s view, Blusun “is simply devoid of control.”?!° It also rejects

Eskosol’s suggestion that Blusun still could recover control in the future. First, apart from the

likelihood of this scenario, “it cannot be argued that hypothetical acquisition of control
triggers the application of Article 25(2)(b) ICSID.”?!” Second, the notion that Blusun could
regain control if sufficient funds could be secured by winning this proceeding to satisfy
Eskosol’s creditors is “conditional on a finding of jurisdiction, which in turn depends on a
prior determination of foreign control. The fundamental timeline is replaced, in the Claimant’s

briefs, by a circular process.”?!®

Italy also addressed the Tribunal’s statement, in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, to the
effect that foreign control “is an issue of international law, not domestic law,” and that “[i]t
would not be consistent with the underlying purposes of the Convention to render an otherwise
qualified foreign-owned entity suddenly ineligible to access its protections.”?!? Italy agrees
with the Tribunal, but clarifies that it does not argue that the construction of “foreign control”
depends on Italian law; rather, it argues that “‘foreign control,’ in line with the rule of
interpretation of Article 31(1) VCLT, cannot possibly mean foreign ownership deprived of
control.”?”° Italy agrees that “the interpretation of ‘foreign control’ is squarely a matter of
international law,” but states that “Italian law matters as a fact, because it determines whether
Blusun held and exercised any control power at the critical time.”??! In this regard, Italy notes
that “Article 42 of the Italian Bankruptcy Law is crystal clear in this regard: ‘the bankruptcy
order from the time it is issued deprives the bankrupt of the right to administer and dispose
of the assets in his possession at the date of the decree.””*” It its view, “[t]hese proceedings,
launched by the receiver, are the clearest evidence that somebody is still controlling the
company in liquidation.”??>

Italy further addresses the Tribunal’s concern in the Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection that

Eskosol could become “suddenly ineligible” to enforce its rights. In its view, should Eskosol

have wished to bring a claim against Italy, it could have done so since 2011, “and for a long

while thereafter, until the Italian court’s order in November 2013.”?74

Regarding the critical time to assess the existence of foreign control under Article 25(2)(b) of
the ICSID Convention, Italy notes that Article 25 “does not contain an express indication of
when foreign control of legal persons must exist for the Centre to have jurisdiction by virtue
of a special agreement of the parties.”?”° In its view, “[s]ince Article 25(2)(b) ICSID provides
the Contracting States with the power to extend the Centre’s jurisdiction, by replacing the
criterion of nationality with that of control, it stands to reason that the lack of the replaced
criterion (foreign nationality) and the replacement criterion (foreign control) be ascertained at

922

the same critical moment, that is, the time of consent to arbitration.”??° Eskosol “lost foreign

control long before it consented to arbitrate its ECT-related grievances. There is no issue of

losing previously acquired arbitration rights.”??”

Italy also rejects the argument that a potential injustice could arise if there were a requirement
of continuous nationality, for example in an expropriation case, as the investor would be
deprived of its right to ICSID arbitration by the very act which it wishes to challenge in such
a proceeding.””* In its view, no such scenario arises here, for three reasons. First, the Tribunal
only must require continuous ownership and control up through the time of consent, but not
afterwards. Second, this is not an expropriation case. And third, approximately two and a half

years passed after the challenged measures, before Eskosol lost its foreign control.?”?

b. Eskosol’s position

Eskosol rejects Italy’s argument that it no longer was subject to foreign control as required
under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. First, Eskosol notes that Article 25(2)(b) “is

silent on the definition and timing of ‘foreign control’ and does not even suggest, much less

establish, when ‘foreign control’ must exist.”?°° It argues that “nowhere does the ICSID
Convention provide support to the conclusion that ‘foreign control’ over the domestic

corporate claimant must exist at the time of consent.”?*!

Eskosol also notes that none of the cases Italy cites deal with the agreement on foreign control
contained in the ECT. Indeed, none of these cases were faced “with a decision on the issue of
whether the reference to foreign control in Article 25(2)(b) could only mean that such foreign
control must exist at the time of consent to arbitration.”?* It argues, inter alia, that the TSA
decision “is distinguishable because it was accepted that ‘at all possible critical dates (the
request of arbitration, the consent to jurisdiction, the origin of the dispute), [claimant] was
controlled by an Argentinian national.””?** Eskosol also refers to the Tribunal’s statement in
its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection that “there is no temporal element ... simply a reference
to the parties’ agreement.”?* In its view, it is this agreement that should guide the Tribunal,
and when the requirement set forth in Article 26(7) of the ECT is satisfied, “which Eskosol
does, then Article 25(2) [of the ICSID Convention] is also satisfied.”?** Eskosol criticizes
Italy for “mak[ing] the assertion that ‘Article 26(7) ECT ... is open-ended’ and ‘thus contains
no agreement, and can raise no presumption of foreign control, with respect to Eskosol or any

other specific company.””?*°

According to Eskosol, in placing emphasis on the importance of the objective component of

Article 25(2)(b), Italy ignores the Tribunal’s finding that:

The term “foreign control” is not defined in the ICSID Convention, and tribunals
have concluded that the absence of a definition represented a deliberate choice by
the drafters. In reliance on the consensual nature of the Convention, they preferred
giving the parties the greatest latitude to define these terms themselves, provided that

the criteria agreed upon by the parties are reasonable and not totally inconsistent with
the purposes of the Convention.?*”

Eskosol agrees with the Tribunal’s statement in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection that
Italy’s objection ultimately “depends on the proposition that Eskosol’s entry into bankruptcy
proceedings following the challenged State measures divested it of the uncontroverted foreign
control it enjoyed prior to bankruptcy [.]”°* Eskosol says that Italy places undue emphasis on
the Tribunal’s use of the word “sudden” in the context of asserted ineligibility to enforce its
rights, “when the key point is simply that an otherwise qualified foreign-owned entity should
not be divested of access to ICSID due to it being placed in bankruptcy, especially when it is

alleged to be due to illegal measures adopted by the Respondent.”?°°

Eskosol challenges Italy’s position that it “freely chose to take advantage of the process of
receivership, with all its legal implications.” First, Eskosol’s bankruptcy was the result of
claims by its creditors. Second, Eskosol states that “[w]hat is sudden is that merely invoking
bankruptcy proceedings to block Eskosol’s jurisdiction here would allow Italy to effectively
flip a switch turning off access to arbitration for ‘an otherwise qualified foreign-owned
entity.””?#° This result is particularly problematic when the cause of the bankruptcy is alleged
to be the State’s breach of the ECT.™"! In this regard, Eskosol notes that Italy failed to address
the Tribunal’s conclusion, in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, as follows:

[T]his would mean that even in demonstrated cases where State conduct is partially

or wholly responsible for the financial straits that led to the bankruptcy (as Eskosol

alleges in this case), the State could avoid scrutiny of its acts by virtue of their own

consequences, simply by invoking the predictable reality that local bankruptcy
proceedings always will be supervised by local courts.?4

2. The Notion of “Foreign Control” under the ECT
a. Italy’s position
Italy asserts that the ECT imposes two requirements with respect to foreign control: (i) it

requires actual foreign control, as opposed to mere ownership; and (ii) foreign control must

exist at the moment when the dispute arose.

For the proposition that the ECT requires actual foreign control, Italy relies on the ECT’s

Understanding with respect Article 1(6):

For greater clarity as to whether an Investment made in the Area of one Contracting
Party is controlled, directly or indirectly, by an Investor of any other Contracting
Party, control of an Investment means control in fact, determined after an
examination of the actual circumstances in each situation. In any such examination,
all relevant factors should be considered, including the Investor’s

(a) financial interest, including equity interest, in the Investment;

(b) ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and operation of
the Investment; and

(c) ability to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members of the board
of directors or any other managing body.”

According to Italy, this Understanding makes it clear that the ECT requires “control in fact,”
looking at the “actual circumstances” of the case and consideration of “all relevant factors.”?*4
Italy states that Eskosol has failed to prove these elements to establish the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.?*

Italy agrees with Eskosol that the expression “before a dispute arises” has to be read as
meaning “immediately before” or “as of the moment” a dispute arises. The Parties disagree,
however, on the meaning of “dispute.”?#° Italy relies on the ICJ jurisprudence for the

proposition that a dispute is “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views

or interests between parties” and that “[i]t must be shown that the claim of one party is

positively opposed by the other.”?4”

217. Italy asserts that the dispute arose on 20 July 2015, when Eskosol sent a notice of dispute to

the Italian Government, which was 20 months after Eskosol, in its view, stopped being
controlled by Blusun in November 2013.74* In this regard, Italy requests the Tribunal to

distinguish “between the time of the breach and the time of the dispute.”?4°

218. Italy also addresses the Tribunal’s question, in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, as to

whether there is logic to divesting “the entity of its otherwise applicable right to seek redress
for grievances against the State.”?*° Italy argues that Eskosol was not “divested” from its right
to launch arbitration against Italy for an alleged breach of the ECT. ICSID arbitration was
available to Eskosol for more than 30 months from March/May 2011 to November 2013, and
Eskosol “failed to exercise its right to consent to arbitration” before it “voluntarily triggered

receivership and knowingly ceased to be controlled by Belgian investors.”?>!

219. — Italy asserts that Eskosol tries “to replace the time of the challenged measures (in 2011) with

the time in which the dispute arose.” Italy notes that Eskosol “strung together five passages

of its pleadings in which, allegedly, it had signaled the notion that the dispute had arisen since

2011.”?5? In Italy’s view, by stating that “[t]he Italian Government was aware, or should have
known, that these measures were opposed by and would injure solar energy investors, such as
Eskosol,” Eskosol shows “the impossibility to satisfy the legal test for a dispute to exist.”?>
Indeed, Italy notes that “[t]here is no reference to any legal claim in this sentence, whilst the
existence of a legal claim amenable to a specific source of obligations (which must
subsequently meet with positive opposition by the entity whose responsibility is invoked) is

the quintessential element of a dispute.”?**

Italy also criticizes Eskosol’s reliance on De Levi, arguing that, contrary to Eskosol’s
suggestion, paragraph 149 of this award “did not address the critical time of the dispute, but
the critical time of the breach.” Indeed, Italy points out that the footnote to the same paragraph
says that “the moment when an alleged breach of the treaty occurs is not necessarily the same
as the moment in which the dispute arises,” and that at paragraph 167 of the same award
the tribunal held that “a breach or violation does not become a ‘dispute’ until the injured party
identifies the breach or violation and objects to it.”*°° In Italy’s view, “[t]he putative exchange
between Mr. Scognamiglio and Government officials in which the latter allegedly reassured
the former about his planned investments, in 2010, cannot ... amount to evidence of a legal
dispute relating to an ECT-claim about the 2011 measures, met with positive opposition by
the Respondent.”?>7 Italy thus concludes that the dispute crystallized “only at the time of the

trigger letter in 2015.”?°*

b. Eskosol’s position

Eskosol argues that “[it] was under foreign control before this dispute arose; and it remains

under foreign control for purposes of ECT Article 26(7) in any event because, inter alia, it

remains majority-owned by Blusun and its foreign controlled status cannot be stripped away

by the bankruptcy which Italy’s own misconduct proximately caused.””°?

Eskosol says that Italy’s argument that the ECT’s Understanding “rule{s] out all possible
attempts to argue that ‘foreign control’ exists simply by reason of foreign majority
shareholding” ignores the following finding by the Tribunal in its Decision on Rule 41(5)
Objection:
The factors listed in the Understanding are each in a sense structural, deriving either
from the distribution of company shares or from the distribution of powers regarding
management, operation, and selection of board members, which generally are
reflected in a company’s foundational documents. While the company’s economic
fortunes may wax and wane, and certain exigencies may require a resort to
bankruptcy protection, there is no suggestion in the ECT Understanding that the
possibility of financial misfortune was expected to outweigh a more structural

analysis of control, and render an entity ipso facto locally controlled, simply because
of the necessary supervision of a bankruptcy court.”

Italy having acknowledged that “the Belgian shareholders did indeed possess and exercise
control over the Claimant,” Eskosol says that “Italy’s argument continues to be that ‘financial
misfortune’ somehow ‘outweigh[s] a more structural analysis of control.’ Not so. Under the
ECT, Eskosol remains foreign controlled by its majority shareholders, regardless of the local

bankruptcy court’s supervision.”?°!

Eskosol also challenges Italy’s argument that the date the dispute arose is 20 July 2015, when
Eskosol notified it of its allegations regarding a breach of the ECT. Eskosol says that the
dispute arose in 2011, and that its position is consistent with a number of statements in the
Request for Arbitration and Eskosol’s pleadings on Italy’s application under Rule 41(5).7°
Eskosol relies on Maffezini for the proposition that “there is a difference between a dispute
and a claim” and that “[w]hile a dispute may have emerged, it does not necessarily have to

coincide with the presentation of a formal claim.” In its view, it was in 2011 that Eskosol

and Italy became positively opposed: the Government “was aware, or should have known,

that these measures were opposed by and would injure solar energy investors, such as Eskosol,
after their enactment.” Eskosol also refers to public debate at the time of the adoption of
the Romani Decree, including the statements made by financial institutions, Italian politicians
and the European Commission.?°> Eskosol also refers to the concerns raised by Mr.

Scognamiglio with Italian Government officials.?°°

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

There is no dispute that as of the dates of the two State measures that are alleged to have
violated Italy’s ECT obligations (the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, in March and
May 2011 respectively), Eskosol was controlled in all relevant respects by Blusun— a Belgian
company that owned 80% of its shares, and that exercised the powers of control attendant to
such dominant shareholding under its foundational documents. There is equally no dispute
that as of the later date when Eskosol’s ECT claim was registered by ICSID (22 December
2015), Eskosol was in liquidation proceedings in Italy, having been declared insolvent on 12
November 2013. As would be expected, those proceedings were supervised by an Italian court
(in Brindisi), and the receiver the court appointed was an Italian national, Mr. Contardi. The

question is whether the latter circumstances have jurisdictional significance for this case.

As the Tribunal discussed in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, both the ICSID Convention
and the ECT establish that, in appropriate circumstances, a company incorporated in the host
State can be accepted as qualified to bring a claim against the host State, notwithstanding the
normal requirement that a claimant must have the nationality of another Contracting State. As

to what those circumstances are, both texts must be separately examined and satisfied.

Beginning with the ICSID Convention, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention establishes
jurisdiction over “any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a

Contracting State ... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the

view, the critical date is the one on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even when the measure represents
the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have started years earlier. It is not uncommon that
divergences or disagreements develop over a period of time before they finally ‘crystallize’ in an actual measure
affecting the investor’s treaty rights.”) (emphasis in Eskosol’s pleading).

dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre” (emphasis added). This principle of
diversity of nationality is subject to a specific exception reflected in Article 25(2)(b), which
includes within the definition of a foreign national “any juridical person which had the
nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties
consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and which, because of foreign
control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State
for the purposes of this Convention.” The reference to a party agreement in turn requires

?57 sets forth

reference to Article 26(7) of the ECT, which (as the Tribunal previously noted)
two requirements, separated by the conjunctive “and,” for a host State company to be treated
as a qualified foreign national for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. First,
such company must have the host State nationality “on the date of [its] consent in writing” to
ICSID, a requirement that was clearly satisfied by virtue of Eskosol’s Italian corporate
nationality. Second and independently, the company must be “controlled by” investors of

another Contracting Party “before a dispute between it and that Contracting Party arises.”

227. The Parties have debated extensively both the legal issue of when foreign control must be

established to satisfy the ECT and ICSID Convention tests, and the factual issue of whether
those tests were satisfied on the operative date(s).7°° Beginning with the temporal issue, this
involves two distinct questions. First, for purposes of the ECT Article 26(7) foreign control
inquiry, when can the relevant “dispute” between Eskosol and Italy be said to have arisen —
the date of the challenged measures, the date Eskosol first objected to those measures, or the
date when ICSID registered Eskosol’s ECT claim? Second, for purposes of the ICSID

Convention Article 25(2)(b) inquiry, does the reference to party agreement on foreign control

267 Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, { 87.

268 Tt is uncontroversial that the tests of both the ECT and ICSID must be satisfied, because Article 25(3)(b) of the
ICSID Ci ion has both subjective and objective The subj looks to whether there
has been an agreement to treat a local entity as a national of another Contracting State; the objective component
requires a tribunal to satisfy itself that control indeed was exercised by a national of the Contracting State, because
“parties do not have unlimited discretion to define as foreign-controlled an entity that objectively is not, or that
objectively is controlled only by nationals of a non-Contracting State.” Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, 4 90 (citing
authorities). Nonetheless, as the Tribunal previously noted, “[g]iven the importance of the parties’ stated intentions as
reflected in their agreement, ... a tribunal should not conclude that foreign control objectively is lacking unless there
are unusual circumstances that preclude deference to their agreement to ‘treat[]’ an entity as so controlled. These
circumstances would require a finding that the criteria agreed by the parties are simply unreasonable, or that
application of such criteria would result in an outcome that contravenes the underlying purposes of the ICSID
Convention.” /d. (citing authorities).

make the ECT critical date dispositive, or does the ICSID Convention impose an additional
requirement that, whatever the control finding may be as of the date the dispute arose, foreign
control must subsist at least through the date of consent to ICSID arbitration (i.e., registration

of the claim)?

The Tribunal offered certain preliminary observations on these questions in its Decision on
Rule 41(5) Objection, based on the limited (expedited) briefing the Parties then had submitted.
Among other things, the Tribunal agreed with Professor Schreuer that Article 25(2)(b)’s
wording “is not without ambiguity” regarding the operative date for foreign control,”
because the Article references the date of consent to arbitration as critical to the nationality
determination, but does not contain an express temporal element with reference to foreign
control, simply a reference to the parties’ agreement.?”” The Tribunal also noted that “either
interpretation of Article 25(2)(b) could have significant implications for cases involving facts
different from this one,”?7! for example: (i) in cases involving corporate transactions between
the date the dispute arose and the date of consent, where an exclusive focus on control as of
the date of the dispute could “facilitate the buying or selling of ICSID claims ... to new owners
... with no element of foreign control whatsoever” by the date a claim is brought,”” or (ii) in
cases involving State nationalization or forced sales to third parties, where an exclusive focus
on control as of the date of consent could enable States “to shield them[selves] from challenge
for wrongdoing that directly precipitated the loss of control.”?”> Finally, the Tribunal observed
that because “all interpretations of arguably ambiguous treaty language have potential
doctrinal consequences for future cases that should not be lightly ignored,” this “counsels for
caution” in how tribunals proceed with such exercises, “particularly where the issue presented

appears ... to be one of first impression.”?”

The Tribunal reaffirms its previously expressed view about the importance of prudence, in
not reaching out to decide unsettled points of law that are not strictly necessary to the
resolution of the issues before it. In this case, that proves to be the situation regarding the
temporal question, because the Tribunal ultimately concludes that the answer to that question
is not necessary to resolve Italy’s jurisdictional objection. Arguendo, if Eskosol were correct
that the only critical date for foreign control purposes was the date of the challenged State
measures, then it is undisputed that Eskosol was controlled by a Belgian company on the
relevant dates, and therefore that it has jurisdiction to proceed with its claim. Correspondingly,
if (arguendo) Italy were correct that the key date for foreign control purposes was the date
ICSID registered Eskosol’s claim, the Tribunal concludes that Eskosol’s status as being in
liquidation proceedings does not suffice to make either the Italian receiver or the Italian court
the controlling entity, for purposes of determining jurisdiction to bring claims under the ECT
and the ICSID Convention, and Italy has not pointed to any indicia of change in control other

than the pendency of those proceedings.

As the Tribunal noted in its prior decision, the term “foreign control” is not defined in the
ICSID Convention, and tribunals have concluded that the absence of a definition represented
a deliberate choice by the drafters.?” “In reliance on the consensual nature of the Convention,
they preferred giving the parties the greatest latitude to define these terms themselves,
provided that the criteria agreed upon by the parties are reasonable and not totally inconsistent
with the purposes of the Convention.”?’° In this case, the ECT text does not define control for
purposes of determining whether a local company is “controlled” by a foreign investor
pursuant to Article 26(7), but the term “controlled” also was used in the definition of
“Investment” in Article 1(6), which refers to “every kind of asset, owned or controlled directly
or indirectly by an Investor....” The Tribunal considers it appropriate to construe the term
consistently across these two provisions. The Tribunal therefore gives due weight to the

“Understanding” adopted by the ECT parties with respect to Article 1(6).?”’? Moreover, the

Tribunal sees no reason, for purposes of an ICSID Convention “objective” control analysis,
to adopt different criteria than those on which the ECT parties subjectively agreed. The stated
criteria are “reasonable” and in no way threaten to “permit parties to use the Convention for

purposes for which it was clearly not intended.”?”*

According to the joint Understanding adopted by the ECT parties, “control of an Investment
means control in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in each
situation.”?”° The Tribunal accepts that “control in fact” is not to be decided exclusively by
reference to equity shareholding, although “equity interest” is included within the first of three
“relevant factors” identified in the Understanding’s non-exhaustive list of items to consider
in determining control (“financial interest, including equity interest”). With respect to this
factor, there has been no allegation of any intervening transaction that altered Eskosol’s
shareholding structure, after the date of the challenged measures and before ICSID’s
registration of its claim. To the contrary, the Parties agree that Blusun, a Belgian company,
continues to own 80% of the Eskosol shares. Moreover, the Parties have not made any
significant arguments based on the identity of Eskosol’s creditors, to try to establish control-

in-fact based on the allocation of any “financial interest” other than “equity interest.”

The Understanding identifies as the second and third “relevant factors” the “ability to exercise
substantial influence over the management and operation of the Investment,” and the “ability
to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members of the board of directors or
any other managing body.” The Tribunal previously noted that these factors are to a large
degree “structural,” deriving from the distribution of power that generally would be reflected
in a company’s foundational documents.”*° There has been no allegation of any change in
Eskosol’s foundational documents, for example regarding the distribution of voting power,
the appointment of Board members and officers, and the authority of officers to take decisions

on their own versus referring them to the Board.

Rather, as the Tribunal previously observed, “Italy’s sole objection is that the bankruptcy
filing itself displaced whatever mechanisms of control existed previously, so that from that
date on, ‘control in fact’ of Eskosol manifestly resided in the hands only of its receiver and
the supervising bankruptcy court. This is said to follow from Italian law regarding the powers
of a bankruptcy receiver and court.”?*! But the ECT parties no doubt were aware of the
possibility that the “economic fortunes [of a local company] may wax and wane, and certain
exigencies may require a resort to bankruptcy protection.””*? And yet, as the Tribunal
previously observed, “there is no suggestion in the ECT Understanding that the possibility of
financial misfortune was expected to outweigh a more structural analysis of control, and
render an entity ipso facto locally controlled, simply because of the necessary supervision of

a bankruptcy court.”?*>

It is of course true that a bankruptcy receiver exercises significant influence over the
management of a company’s assets, under the supervision of a bankruptcy court, while the
company remains in bankruptcy proceedings. However, the receiver does not exercise such
authority on his own behalf, making him the ultimate party-in-interest to the company’s

fate,?*4

and therefore supporting some conclusion that it is his nationality that properly should
govern for ECT and ICSID Convention purposes. Rather, the receiver acts essentially as a
trustee or agent — not as a principal — on behalf of those with dominant legal and financial
interests in the company (e.g., shareholders and priority creditors). The trustee administers
the company in the shareholders’ interests, not in his own. That agency moreover is a
temporary power, not a permanent one, and it remains in place only so long as the entity
remains in bankruptcy. That status could come to an end for various reasons, including (but
not limited to) the possibility that an insolvent entity prevails in a legal claim and collects

sufficient recovery to settle its outstanding debts.

In this case, Italy concedes that Eskosol’s shareholders “retained certain rights, even after the

opening of the receivership procedure ... such as the right to reach an agreement with the

285

creditors.”?*> In other words, if they had the means and saw a business reason for doing so,
the shareholders could choose to infuse additional capital into the company, to enable it to
emerge from bankruptcy and resume operations. However likely or unlikely that might be on
the facts, the shareholders’ legal right to make such choices, if considered warranted and
feasible from a business perspective, is an important indicia of their residual control, even if
they have been forced by extenuating circumstances to place the company into temporary

administration.

Finally, the determination of control for purposes of the ECT or ICSID must be conducted in
a way that is consistent with, and not in violation of, the object and purpose of those treaties.
Without entering into a broad exploration of the treaties’ object and purpose, it is fair to say
that at least one such purpose includes facilitating the neutral resolution of disputes between
investors and States, regarding those States’ treatment of investments made within their
borders. It is a reality that a substantial number of foreign investments are made through local
companies incorporated in host States, and that reality was reflected inter alia in both Article
25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(7) of the ECT. In the Tribunal’s view, it
would be inconsistent with that understanding, and with the object and purpose of the treaties,
to divest local companies that indisputably were owned by foreign investors from the ability
to pursue potentially well-founded ECT claims, simply because of a subsequent collapse in
the company’s economic fortunes, particularly in circumstances where it is alleged that the
collapse was attributable to the State’s own wrongful conduct. Yet that would be the inevitable
outcome of Italy’s suggestion that any bankruptcy filing by the local company should be
deemed to transfer effective control either to the receiver or to the host State’s courts, since
almost by definition both the receiver and the local judges overseeing his work will be

nationals of the host State.
The Tribunal stated as much in its Decision on the Rule 41(5) Objection, as follows:

While the Convention’s drafters may have been content largely to defer to the parties to
reach their own agreements regarding the facts of control, such agreements must be
consistent with the underlying purpose of the Convention, including the protection in
appropriate cases of foreign investment. It would not be consistent with the underlying
purposes of the Convention to render an otherwise qualified foreign-owned entity suddenly

239.

240.

ineligible to access its protections, simply because the entity’s liabilities eventually
overtake its assets enough to justify (at least temporary) supervision of its activities to
protect the rights of creditors. Among other things, this would mean that even in
demonstrated cases where State conduct is partially or wholly responsible for the financial
straits that led to the bankruptcy (as Eskosol alleges in this case), the State could avoid
scrutiny of its acts by virtue of their own consequences, simply by invoking the predictable
reality that local bankruptcy proceedings always will be supervised by local courts. But
even in less dramatic situations, such as where the bankruptcy is attributable largely to
factors other than State action, there still is no logic to divesting the entity of its otherwise
applicable right to seek redress for grievances against the State — particularly when doing
so might enable it to reverse its financial fortunes enough to emerge from bankruptcy.
There is certainly nothing in the ICSID Convention to suggest that implementation of the
foreign control requirement for jurisdiction was intended to depend on the financial
fortunes or misfortunes of the local entity.?*°

Since that time, the Tribunal has seen nothing in the subsequent briefing to change its view.

Accordingly, Italy’s jurisdictional objection on the basis of lack of foreign control is denied.

ADMISSIBILITY OBJECTION
1. Res Judicata and Duplication of Proceedings Generally
a. Italy’s position

Italy contends that, even if the Tribunal were to find that it has jurisdiction, Eskosol’s claims
are inadmissible “as contrary to res judicata and any other principle barring duplication of

proceedings.”?°”

According to Italy, the dispute in this arbitration is substantially the same as the one in the
Blusun case. In that case: (i) the dispute concerned Blusun’s investments in Italy through
Eskosol; (ii) Blusun challenged various measures, including the Romani Decree and Conto
Energia IV; and (iii) as Eskosol admitted in its application under Rule 41(5) in the Blusun
case, its claims in this arbitration “arise from the same factual matrix and adverse measures

that [we]re at issue in the Blusun arbitration.”?**

241. Italy also argues that the following conclusions of the Blusun tribunal, which “are related to
lack of causation, would have equally applied in the event that the claimants had based their

grievances on other standards under the ECT”:

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants have not discharged the onus of proof of
establishing that the Italian state’s measures were the operative cause of the Puglia
Project’s failure. Of far greater weight was the continued dependence on project
financing, and the failure to obtain it was due both to the size of the Project and to
justified concerns about the scope of DIA authorisation, on which the legality of the
Project depended. That being so, the claim under Article 10(1) for loss of the Project

would fail in any event.?*°
242. In Italy’s view, the Blusun case and this proceeding concern “identical qualified
interests.” Italy notes the Tribunal’s observation, in its Decision on Rule 41(5)
Objection, that “there may be certain circumstances in which a foreign shareholder and
the local company in which it holds shares have such identical interests that it would be
abusive to permit arbitration of a given dispute by one after the other already has
concluded an arbitration over the same dispute.” The Tribunal indicated this could apply
in a situation where “a first case were brought by the 100% shareholders of a local
company and thereafter a second case was attempted by the local company that they

wholly owned.”??°

243. — Italy says that the Tribunal “did not imply that the above principle of identity of interest could
only apply in case of wholly owned companies, since it indicates this situation as only one

example of ‘identical interests’.”??! According to Italy,

if the parent company places itself in the position of being made substantively whole
for the alleged harm, then the harm caused by the contested remedies is remedied.
Blusun claimants requested damages for the failure of the Project, and included in
the losses all harms also claimed by Eskosol.?°?

244. — Italy challenges Eskosol’s arguments that: (i) Blusun failed to coordinate with Eskosol in

pursuing its claims in the Blusun case, which in turn would indicate that it did not intend to

share with Eskosol any proceeds of those claims; and (ii) Blusun did not represent Eskosol’s

significant interests.””>

Regarding the first aspect of Eskosol’s argument, Italy contends as follows: (i) Eskosol waited
more than two years after the decision was taken to liquidate the company to initiate this
proceeding, so it is difficult to argue that it bears no responsibility for Blusun proceeding with
an arbitration first, and there is no evidence that Blusun impeded Eskosol from starting an
arbitration earlier; (ii) the statement that Blusun had no intention of sharing any proceeds of
its arbitration with Eskosol is purely speculative; and (iii) Eskosol’s minority shareholders,
whose interests allegedly were not represented in the B/usun case, in any event were not

qualified investors under the ECT who would be entitled to the benefit of ECT protections.?**

Regarding the second aspect of Eskosol’s argument, Italy says that any harm to Eskosol from
the challenged measures could have been fully repaired in the Blusun case, as Blusun’s
claimed losses in that proceeding included Eskosol’s equity value as well as the capital

injected into the project.?°>

Italy says that in the present circumstances, where Eskosol’s “minority shareholders would
not be entitled by any means to ECT or ICSID protection as nationals of Italy ... there is no
discrimination, nor deprivation of fundamental rights of anyone legitimate to claim them

under the relevant foreign investment protection regime.”°°

Italy further rejects Eskosol’s argument that not allowing it to seek redress would jeopardize
its creditors. Aside from noting that the creditors are also Italian, Italy says that “they did not
directly claim for damages suffered by their own investments and consequently they have no

right to recover under this arbitration.””°’ It adds that the claims of Eskosol’s minority

shareholders and its creditors could be pursued in the Italian courts under Italian law, but not

through an ECT arbitration.

b. Eskosol’s position

Eskosol rejects Italy’s res judicata objection. It explains that res judicata requires identity of

(i) parties, (ii) cause, and (iii) object, none of which has been established here.**

First, Eskosol argues that Blusun and Eskosol “are plainly not identical.”?* It also says that
“the finding of an identity of interest depends on the circumstances at issue” and notes that,
in its Decision on Respondent’s Application under Rule 41(5), “[t]his Tribunal found that in
the present circumstances there was no identity of interests between the Eskosol and Blusun
claimants.”> Eskosol rejects the application of a possible exception based on 100%
ownership by the foreign shareholder, because “Eskosol is not wholly owned by Blusun, and
... [a]t no point was Eskosol’s independent corporate personality abused.”*°! Nor has Eskosol
acted in concert with Blusun. Indeed, it was Blusun that rejected consolidation of its ICSID
case with the case Eskosol later initiated, which is why Eskosol filed an application under
ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) to be heard as a non-disputing party in the Blusun case,
“precisely to ensure that Blusun did not claim the damages that only Eskosol could rightfully

claim.”*” Blusun opposed that application as well.

As to the delay in filing the Request for Arbitration, Eskosol explains that its timing was
“reasonable under the circumstances,” as it sent Italy a trigger letter on 20 July 2015, i.e., less
than a year after it went into receivership, and it needed that time to discuss the claim with the
receiver, retain counsel, obtain third party funding and seek approval from the creditors’

committee and the judge in charge of receivership.*°

Eskosol finally claims that neither of the other two prongs of the triple identity test are met in
this proceeding. First, the two proceedings do not concern the same contested measures. While
Eskosol’s claims concern two contested measures (the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV,
both issued in 2011), the B/usun claim was based on a number of events that spanned a five-
year period (2008-2012), just two of which were the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV."
Also, Eskosol argues, Blusun claimed only for its reflective losses as a shareholder in Eskosol,
while Eskosol is claiming for 100% of the company’s losses arising out of the two contested
measures at issue. Eskosol also notes that Italy offers no support for the assertion that Blusun
requested damages for “all harms also claimed by Eskosol,” and that under Italian law

shareholders “cannot exercise the rights of the company.”*°>

2. Abuse of Rights
a. Italy’s position

Italy argues that the fact “[t]hat the Blusun proceedings resulted in a decision in favour of
Respondent only proves that Italy should not serve as respondent again for a challenge of the
same measures under the ECT, for alleged damages caused to the same business.”>°°

According to Italy, “an investor controlling more than one entity by vertical integration will
commit an abuse if it seeks to challenge the same measures and claim for the same harm at
various levels.”?°’ It argues that since the Orascom tribunal applied this principle in the

presence of multiple treaties leading to parallel protection, a fortiori the principle must apply

when the same treaty is at stake.°*

Italy also states as follows:

[w]hether there is identity between the two claimants, concededly, is a matter of
perspective. Formally, shareholders are distinct from the company. In practice, they
might be inextricably linked. The rationale of RSM was deployed in cases of 100%
ownership, but there is no principled reason why it should not apply in other cases
where ownership is lower. For instance, the Orascom tribunal did not hinge its

finding of inadmissibility on the condition of 100% ownership, but on the specific
circumstances of the case, which evinced the abusive duplication of the claims even
if these were based on different treaties.”

This, in Italy’s view, was confirmed by Eskosol when it recalled that its application in the
Blusun case under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) was made to ensure that Blusun could not
claim the damages that only Eskosol could rightfully claim. According to Italy, “Blusun did,
in fact, claim the share of damages on which Eskosol claimed monopoly. That the case failed

on the merits is irrelevant to this point.”*!°

Italy also asserts that, should the Claimant’s thesis that it has been at all times under the control
of Blusun be accepted, then the investor has “abused of its right by duplicating requests for
redress under the ECT by taking benefit of the possibility in abstracto to access arbitration

separately in its own name and through its local company.”*!!

Italy finally distinguishes this case from the situation in CME,>'? on the grounds that here,
Italy sought (rather than refused) to consolidate proceedings.*!* Moreover, given that Eskosol
waited more than two years after the start of the Blusun case to file its claim, the “[a]lleged
lack of cooperation by Blusun should indeed be at least confronted with Eskosol’s own
responsibility for postponing any serious attempt to intervene in the Blusun arbitration to

claim its rights.”?!*

b. Eskosol’s position

Eskosol claims that the circumstances in Orascom, on which Italy relies for its abuse of
process objection, were unique and are not present here. In Orascom, the tribunal found that:
“(i) ‘the dispute being notified in the three notices is effectively one and the same’; and (ii)
that all three notices of dispute were sent by Mr. Sawiris who owned and controlled each of

the three vertically integrated companies.”*'> Eskosol also notes Algeria’s argument in that

case that “Mr. Sawiris used his group of companies to seek to maximize his chances of success
by introducing several arbitration proceedings against the Respondent at different levels of
the chain of companies.”?!* This case, by contrast, does not involve a single person or entity
seeking to maximize its chances by repeat arbitrations. To the contrary, there has been a

complete lack of cooperation between Blusun and Eskosol.

Eskosol also rejects Italy’s assertion that it “should not be penalized for the lack of
coordination between Eskosol and Blusun.”*!’ As explained, Eskosol’s delay in filing the
application under Rule 37(2) in the Blusun case was due to the difficulties associated with
representing a company in bankruptcy. Moreover, the Rule 37(2) application would not have
allowed Eskosol to assert its rights in the Blusun case, but solely to be heard as a non-party.

Regarding consolidation, Eskosol repeats that it was Blusun who rejected that possibility.*!*

Finally, Eskosol argues that “there can be multiple legitimate investors under an ECT claim,
as Italy itself admits.”?!° Blusun and Eskosol are not acting in privity nor in concert, and they
do not represent the same interests. Eskosol agrees with the Tribunal’s statement in its
Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection that “it would not be appropriate for tribunals to preclude
arbitration by qualified investors [such as Eskosol], simply because other qualified investors

may have proceeded before them without their participation.”*?°

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal is not called upon to decide whether, as a matter of either efficiency or fairness,
it would be preferable for all shareholders of an entity affected by a challenged State measure
to be heard in a single forum at a single time, together with the entity that they collectively
own. The Tribunal previously observed that it is “not unsympathetic to Italy’s circumstances,
having to face claims now that are closely related to those it already successfully vanquished

in a prior proceeding.”*?! But ultimately, these are system design questions that present policy

264.

issues, none of which are before the Tribunal. As the Tribunal also noted in its prior decision,
“States have the power to create [such a system] if they so wish,” but the fact remains that
they have not done so in either instrument relevant to this case. Specifically, “neither the
ICSID system as presently designed, nor the ECT itself, incorporate clear avenues (much less

a requirement)” for such joinder or consolidation.*?”

In these circumstances, the issue is not whether Eskosol’s claims present certain overlapping
issues of law or fact with those previously presented by Blusun. Rather, the question is
whether, in circumstances where Eskosol otherwise would be permitted to bring an ECT claim
on its own behalf pursuant to ECT Article 26(7), it should be precluded from doing so simply
because Blusun previously invoked different articles of the ECT to bring its own claims.*??
The Tribunal considered this question preliminarily in its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection,
and does so again now with the benefit of the Parties’ additional briefing. In the end, however,

its conclusion remains the same.

First, whether viewed through the lens of res judicata, related preclusion doctrines like
collateral estoppel, or abuse of process, the fact remains that Eskosol and Blusun are not the
same party, either formally or in essence. In both RSM and Orascom, tribunals were presented
with situations where a local company was wholly owned by ultimate beneficial owner(s)
who maneuvered to bring duplicative proceedings. In RSM, a corporate claimant sued first,
and after losing the case it sued a second time, this time joined by the three shareholders who
collectively owned 100% of RSM. The tribunal found that because the three shareholders had
entire control over RSM, they effectively had acted in concert with it and had their interests

represented in the first proceeding, and therefore could not proceed with the second one.*™4 In

322 Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, § 170.

523 See Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, {| 166 (noting that “[t]he ECT authorizes a variety of entities to proceed as
qualified ‘Investor[s]’ under its terms,” including both foreign investors who can bring claims under Article 26(1)
relating to investments that they “own[] or control[] directly or indirectly,” and local companies who are permitted to
bring claims in their own name provided they meet the foreign control requirements of Article 26(7); “Italy itself
admits that in principle, both Blusun and Eskosol could be legitimate investors under the ECT.”).

7.1.5-7.1.6. In its Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection, the Tribunal expressed the view that “the same conclusion [as in
RSM] would be equally logical in the reverse situation, if a first case were brought by the 100% shareholders of a local
company and thereafter a second case was attempted by the local company that they wholly owned.” Decision on Rule

Orascom, which involved a vertical chain of companies each ultimately owned 100% by the
same individual, “the Claimant first caused one of its subsidiaries, OTH, to bring claims
against Algeria. Then, it caused a different subsidiary in the chain, Weather Investments, to
threaten to bring a different arbitration in relation to the same dispute. Finally ... it pursued
yet another investment treaty proceeding in its own name for the same investment ... in
relation to the same host state measures and the same harm.” The Tribunal found this to be

“an abuse of the system of investment protection.”*?>

In this case, by contrast, Eskosol is not wholly owned by Blusun, and there are no facts
suggesting the exercise by Blusun of some hidden hand in order to cause a second claim to be
brought on its behalf. As anomalous as the situation may be, it is apparent not only that Blusun
proceeded in its case without joining Eskosol as a formal party to the proceedings, “as
controlling shareholders often have the power to do by following the corporate formalities
necessary to obtain approval to sue on a company’s behalf,”*”° but also that Blusun actively
resisted any input or participation by Eskosol, when the latter sought to join the Blusun
proceedings or to be heard in them as a non-party. It is also apparent that the current
proceedings did not come about as a result of some deliberate maneuvering by Blusun in order
to have a proverbial “second bite at the apple.” Indeed, Eskosol did not present either of
Blusun’s owners (Mr. Lecorcier and Mr. Stein) as fact witnesses on its behalf, nor did they
attend any of the Hearings as its party representatives. There was fact testimony from
Eskosol’s witness Mr. Scognamiglio (one of Eskosol’s two minority shareholders) about a
falling out between the erstwhile partners, such that “Mr. Lecorcier, at the end of 2011,

stopped talking to me.”22”

The fact that the minority shareholders in Eskosol are Italian nationals, who would not have
been qualified to pursue a proceeding in their own names, does not affect the analysis. Where
an international treaty authorizes a claim to be brought by a local company, that company
speaks for itself, and not as a vehicle only for the interests of whichever shareholders might

have sued on their own behalf on the basis of their qualifying nationality. Similarly, the local

company may seek redress for 100% of the losses it allegedly suffered from the challenged
State measures, and not simply for some prorated portion of those losses reflecting the
percentage of its shares that are owned by qualifying foreign nationals. If the company is
successful in proving both liability and damages, the end result may well be some eventual
indirect benefit to its shareholders (including both the qualified foreign shareholders and other
shareholders of non-qualifying nationalities), but that does not follow automatically as a
matter of economic analysis, since — depending on the company’s circumstances — there may
be others (such as creditors) who hold priority claims ahead of any shareholder distribution.
In any event, the ultimate distribution of any recovery by a local company has no impact on
the company’s right under the ECT to bring a claim on its own behalf for the full extent of its
losses, even if some of its shareholders may be nationals of the host State or of third countries

who could not have brought ECT claims on their own behalves.

Finally, the Tribunal acknowledges that if any damages Eskosol recovered were sufficient to
allow for distribution to shareholders after resolving priority debt obligations, Blusun itself
could benefit indirectly from Eskosol’s recovery, despite previously failing in its direct claim
against Italy.** The Tribunal accepts the awkwardness of this outcome, but it is one that arises
mainly because of the odd circumstances of this case, where a majority shareholder and the
company in which it holds shares did not have aligned interests and did not coordinate their
respective litigations, but rather acted in various respects at cross-purposes with one another.
The Tribunal is confident that this situation does not arise regularly. However, the possibility
of an awkward outcome in an anomalous case, that could result in some indirect benefit to a
prior litigant who lost a prior case, is not a reason in principle to strip a current litigant of a

right to arbitration that the ECT expressly grants it, to pursue claims on its own behalf.

Italy’s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility are therefore denied.

28 Since Blusun failed in its direct claim against Italy, this would not present any risk of double-recovery. The Tribunal
agrees with Orascom that tribunals should always remain alert to prevent such an outcome, to ensure that once “the
harm incurred by one entity in the chain is fully repaired in one arbitration,” the other companies in the vertical chain
not be permitted “to recover the same economic loss under any circumstances.” Orascom, RL-57, § 495.

LIABILITY

Eskosol contends that the measures Italy adopted breached its obligations under Articles 10(1)
and 13 of the ECT, in particular with respect to the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”)
standard, the umbrella clause, the obligation to provide full protection to Eskosol’s
investment, the prohibition on unreasonable or discriminatory measures, and the restrictions

on expropriation.”

Italy rejects Eskosol’s claims as unfounded both in fact and in law.**° By way of introduction
applicable to all of Eskosol’s claims, Italy argues that Eskosol never even reached a point at
which it might complain about changes in Italy’s incentives schemes, because any
investments Eskosol made were “preparatory and, necessarily, separate from the investments
to which the incentive schemes apply.”**! Eskosol “had some investments in Italy, but never
was or ever put itself close to concretely be an energy producer, let alone one who could
actually benefit from the benefit schemes.”*** As such, Italy considers that while Eskosol
might qualify as “a promoter” in the photovoltaic industry, it should not be confused with an
ongoing energy-producing concern,** a distinction that Italy considers fatal at the threshold

to each of Eskosol’s claims.

The Parties’ arguments with respect to these issues are addressed in turn below, with particular
emphasis on the FET claim, to which they devoted most of their attention in the submissions.
First, however, the Tribunal summarizes the Parties’ positions on the relevance or lack of
relevance of the Blusun award to the liability issues this Tribunal must decide, a point that the

Parties have each addressed.

A. RELEVANCE OF THE BLUSUN AWARD TO LIABILITY ISSUES

272.

273.

274.

1. Eskosol’s Position

Eskosol contends that the Tribunal should not be influenced by the outcome in the Blusun
case (where all claims against Italy were rejected on the merits), since Blusun and Eskosol

are not identical and do not share the same interest.>*+

Eskosol also observes that the claims in the two arbitrations are not identical. In its view,
Blusun based its case on a number of events in addition to the Romani Decree and Conto
Energia IV, and Blusun’s position was that Italy had never created in the first place a stable
and predictable investment climate for solar energy, which allegedly prevented financing for
the project to be obtained. By contrast, Eskosol’s claim is that it decided to invest in Italy in
part on the basis of the stability and consistency of Italy’s laws,*** and that by adopting the
Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, Italy suddenly and drastically changed the energy laws

on which Eskosol had relied to make its investment.

Eskosol further argues that the two cases do not concern the same losses or even the same
asserted infringements of the ECT. Eskosol’s losses constitute 100% of the losses arising from
the challenged measures, whereas Blusun claimed only for its reflective losses deriving from
its shareholding interest in Eskosol.**° Moreover, while the Blusun tribunal determined that
the economic impact of the reduction in FiTs under Conto Energia IV was 13%, Eskosol
contends that the impact was “at least 31%, if not more.” Eskosol also argues that the Blusun
tribunal failed to give due consideration to the Romani Decree, for example by failing to
appreciate the invalidity of the overcapacity arguments on which that Decree was based, and
by failing to appreciate that the Decree eliminated the grace period included in Conto Energia

III, which increased the overall risk of the Eskosol Project.*>”

2. Italy’s Position

275. Italy states that the Blusun award gives a direct answer to Eskosol’s arguments:

- Eskosol affirms that, but for the contested measures, the Project would have been
realized and would have obtained incentives. The Blusun award clearly states that
“(...) the Project ran a significant risk of incurring legal and administrative
difficulties, even if these could be (and in the event largely were) overcome. Its
success was by no means certain.” (§386)

- In particular, the Claimant states that the suspension of the Siemens EPC was due
to the Romani Decree. The Blusun award responds that “on 28 February 2011,
Eskosol failed to make the 20% down payment for the first tranche of panels and on
7 March 2011, Siemens suspended performance of the EPC contract, which was
never reinstated (...). Eskosol’s failure to pay predated the Romani Decree of 3
March 2011.” (§390)

- Moreover, according to Eskosol the contested measures would have been the cause
for the Project not being financed, and there would be no possible alternative reasons
for the Project to fail aside the adoption of the Romani Decree and the entry into
force of Conto Energia IV. The Blusun award rejects such claim stating that “no
commitments of project financing were, however, obtained at this [the time of the
Romani Decree] or any time” (§100), and that “of far greater weight [to make the
Project fail] was the continued dependence on project financing, and the failure to
obtain it was due both to the size of the Project and to justified concerns about the
scope of DIA authorisation, on which the legality of the Project depended.” (§394).

- On the other side, according to the Claimant, the Conto Energia III would have
generated legitimate expectations. The B/usun tribunal rejects such assertion and
declares that any already marginal expectations that the decree could create would
be “even less powerful because European law had already lowered them: it was clear
that the incentives offered were subject to modification in light, inter alia, of
changing costs and improved technology” (§371).*°*

276. Italy also relies on the following findings in Blusun regarding the legitimacy of the Romani

Decree:

(a) The reduction in FITs was quite substantial, but was not in itself crippling or
disabling. Moreover, it was a response to a genuine fiscal need, given the large take-
up under the earlier Energy Accounts.

(b) The reduction in incentives was proportionately less than the reduction in the cost
of photovoltaic technology during 2010, and left Italian subsidy levels higher than
those in Germany, France and Spain.

(c) The principle of guaranteed tariffs for a 20-year period was maintained.

84

277.

278.

(d) So too was the criterion for qualification for FITs, viz., connection to the grid.

(e) The grace period for grid connection to preserve the preexisting tariff level, viz.,
12 months, was reasonable.

(f) The Fourth Energy Account, applying to photovoltaic plants connected to the grid
between | June 2011 and 31 December 2016, made some allowance for projects that
could not meet the cut-off of 12 months.

(g) Leaving aside questions of administration (dealt with below), the provision for a
register of large plants eligible for feed-in tariffs contributed to legal security.

(h) The limits on the use of agricultural land were motivated by valid rural planning
concerns, although their specific impact on the Puglia Project is a matter to which
the Tribunal will return (see paragraphs 403-408). For these reasons the Tribunal
concludes that the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, taken overall,
were not disproportionate, did not violate specific commitments made to the
promotors of PV plants, and did not breach Article 10(1), first sentence, of the
ECT.*”
Italy sees this analysis as “objective and articulate,” listing “several concurring reasons why
the regulatory change, far from amounting to unfair or inequitable treatment, was a balanced

and carefully designed measure.”**°

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal notes the Parties’ respective arguments about the similarities and differences
between this case and the B/usun case, but sees no threshold issue, in reality, for it to decide.
Italy does not contend that the B/usun findings are binding on this Tribunal; to the contrary,
it expressly disclaims any argument on the merits that “the B/usun award has any binding
force or superior authority.”**! Italy’s argument is simply that the award “offers a compelling

analysis of the legal issue at stake,”*”

an assessment with which Eskosol disagrees. The
Parties thus implicitly concur that the Tribunal should take the Blusun award into
consideration only to the extent it finds the reasoning of that case to be persuasive, a
proposition that is no different than the way in which the Tribunal evaluates any other

jurisprudence to which its attention has been drawn. In any event, and for the avoidance of

doubt, the Tribunal emphasizes that it resolves the pending issues in this claim based on its

own independent analysis, and not on the basis of the decisions of other tribunals.

 

FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT
1. Eskosol’s Position

Invoking a “broad” or “flexible” conception of the fair and equitable treatment standard,
Eskosol contends that the measures Italy adopted breached the standard in six respects. In its
view, Italy (i) violated Eskosol’s legitimate expectations, (ii) failed to provide a stable and
predictable framework for its investments, (iii) did not act transparently, (iv) behaved
inconsistently, (e) acted arbitrarily and unreasonably, and (v) adopted disproportionate

measures.

a. Italy’s violation of Eskosol’s legitimate expectations

Eskosol contends that the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 10(1) of the ECT
includes the obligation not to frustrate investors’ legitimate expectations.*“* Those “legitimate
expectations [can arise] from representations and guarantees provided by the host state,
including in its legislation and regulations.”*+> In Eskosol’s view, these guarantees give rise
to the obligation not to frustrate legitimate expectations especially when the State

“deliberately and actively [seeks] to create those expectations.”*4°
Eskosol relies on scholarly works by Professor Dolzer to the effect that:

The preinvestment legal order forms the framework for the positive reach of the
expectation which will be protected and also the scope of considerations upon which

the host state is entitled to rely when it defends against subsequent claims of the
foreign investor.*””

282. Eskosol also relies on a series of arbitral awards.*#* In Eskosol’s view, it was on the basis of

host State laws and regulations that the LG&E tribunal, for example, held that Argentina
frustrated the investor’s legitimate expectations, as the claimants’ investment was made in
reliance on a law that provided a certain regulatory framework, including a long-term tariff
regime, and Argentina subsequently passed a law that modified the applicable legal

framework and completely altered the economics underpinning LG&E’s investments.*”

Eskosol grounds its proposition also on the decisions rendered in Enron, Suez and Micula.>°
It further contends that it is well established under international law that statements or conduct
of Government officials or state organs, including through legislation, give rise to

obligations.*>!

283. Eskosol argues that it had the legitimate expectation that Italy would respect commitments

previously made through the Conto Energia system, including, inter alia: (i) to grant investors
until May 2012 to secure a right to the stabilized incentivizing tariffs provided under Conto
Energia III; and (ii) to continue offering the Conto Energia III tariff levels until the end of
2013.3 Eskosol notes that Legislative Decree No. 387 of 29 December 2003 envisaged the
adoption of laws and regulations for a tariff program to promote investment in the PV sector,
and that through Conto Energia I, II and III, Italy provided the right to incentivizing tariffs for

20 years, while Conto Energia II and III set out timeframes for access and the specific tariff

to which owners of PV power plants would be entitled.* Eskosol says that this clarity and
advance commitment were necessary for investors to secure project finance, and notes that

Conto Energia II stated a purpose of providing “‘a simplified, stable and durable scheme of

access to the incentives.”>*4

284. In addition, Eskosol argues that a crucial feature of both Conto Energia II and Conto Energia

III was their 14-month grace periods (which Eskosol refers to as “sunset” provisions),*°>

which were triggered after a certain level of incentivized energy had been reached.** This, in
its view, was intended to ensure that investors with ongoing projects would have a reasonable
amount of time to complete their power plants to secure the incentivized tariffs.**’ In practice,
Eskosol contends, this meant that it had a legitimate expectation that it would have until at
least May 2012 to secure a right to the incentivizing tariff. Eskosol argues that this was the
basis for its acquisition of the SPVs in 2010, and that it would have not acquired the SPVs in

the absence of this legitimate expectation.***

285. Eskosol states that its expectation arose not only from Conto Energias II and III but also from

express representations from Government officials in 2010, made both generally to the

public,?°’ and specifically to Eskosol through Mr. Scognamiglio and Eskosol’s lawyers,

Eskosol contends that it was reasonable for it to rely on Italy’s representations, given that the
Government had previously fulfilled its promises in application of Conto Energia I and 11.3“!
In Eskosol’s view, “Italy knew what it was doing — it acted to induce investment by providing
an attractive, stable regulatory regime — and it cannot now seriously contend that the
regulatory environment was uncertain such that Eskosol invested tens of millions of euros in

the hope that the roulette wheel would land on red or on a stray, odd number.”

However, beginning in early 2011, Italy started pulling back on its position in several public
statements.*® Then, on 3 March 2011, Italy adopted the Romani Decree, which according to
Eskosol, prematurely repealed the incentivizing tariffs under Conto Energia III,°* by
eliminating the sunset provision and giving PV plant owners just two months to connect to
the main electricity grid to secure the right to the incentivizing tariffs set out in Conto Energia

IIL.3® This was not enough time for Eskosol to complete its project.

Eskosol argues that the enactment of Conto Energia IV in May 2011 further aggravated its
position, as this did not provide the security ensured by the previous three Conto Energia. In
particular, it did not contain a sunset provision and the incentivizing tariffs were remarkably

reduced from Conto Energia III levels.**° Indeed, Eskosol argues that:

it is misleading for Italy to suggest that [the natural progression between Conto
Energia II and III] can be compared to what occurred with CE III, when it was
suddenly replaced 2.5 years before schedule with CE IV. That was not an expected
natural progression. On the contrary, the Romani Decree and CE IV expressly
violated the terms of CE III.

For example, CE III was designed to last three years 2011, 2012 and 2013, as made
clear by Article 8.2, but the Romani Decree cut CE III short by 2.5 years. Under CE
IIL, Italy promised to grant 3,000 MWs worth of FiTs, but the witness evidenced
confirmed that CE III was cut off when approximately 1,600 MW had been granted.
Thus, for the first time ever a Conto Energia had been terminated before schedule
and without the ceiling on FiTs even being reached. In addition, CE III assured that
if the ceiling was reached investors would have another 14 months to receive FiTs if

their plants entered into operation by then. The sunset provision of CE III provisions

was thrown out by the Romani Decree entirely. This just makes clear that the Romani

Decree cut short CE III in an unprecedented manner in violation of the express

assurances that investors such as Eskosol had been given in CE III itself.*°7
Eskosol notes that the importance of the sunset provision in this arbitration is twofold: (i) first,
it made Eskosol’s reliance on Conto Energia III “not only reasonable, but beyond question.
... With the assurance of a sunset clause of 14 months, Eskosol clearly knew that it had
sufficient time to complete its project”;>** (ii) second, it is also significant for its absence in
Conto Energia IV, which “fundamentally changed the assurances previously relied upon by
Eskosol. Now Eskosol had to face the risk that the new ceilings imposed under CE IV could
be reached quickly; and if they were it faced the risk that it would receive zero FiTs. Of course,
Eskosol could never find a bank to lend its [sic] hundreds of millions of project finance funds,
the repayment of which depend on the stability of FiTs on this basis.”* Eskosol clarifies that
its case rests not just on the elimination of the sunset clause but on the combined impact of

the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV.”

Eskosol also argues that the Romani Decree arbitrarily targeted agricultural projects by
restricting incentive tariff eligibility under the future Conto Energia IV to PV plants which, if
they were placed on agricultural land, occupied no more than 10% of the available agricultural

parcel.>7!

Eskosol rejects Italy’s argument that investors should have known that its regulations would
be subject to change. In its view, the tariff structure of the Conto Energia schemes already
contained a periodic, gradual decrease to reflect the anticipated reduction in costs of PV
technology. By contrast, the Romani Decree was not gradual, the reduction from Conto
Energia III to Conto Energia IV was unexpected and substantial, and the 10% rule on

agricultural land was a surprise that unfairly affected Eskosol.*”*

Eskosol states that the Romani Decree betrayed the very purpose of the Renewables Directive
and was for that reason heavily criticized by the European Union.*” In its view, contrary to
Italy’s position, the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV were not passed to safeguard the
public interest, for the following reasons: (i) the GSE’s comments of 25 January 2011 on the
Draft Romani Decree were based on wrong figures;>” (ii) the Romani Decree levels did not
correspond to any Renewables Directive target;*”> (iii) Italy’s own actions demonstrate that
there was no risk of creating a flooded market or otherwise introducing a problem for
taxpayers;>”° (iv) the European authorities themselves criticized the Romani Decree as it

would make it impossible for Italy to reach its 2020 target;3””

and (v) Italy submitted no
evidence that the change in policy was due to public interest concerns, as it failed to produce
any documents demonstrating that the Romani Decree was accompanied or motivated by any

particular process or concern.>”*

Eskosol contends that the combined effect of these measures was that its project became

economically unviable, leading to the complete loss of Eskosol’s investment in Italy.*””

i. Causal link

Eskosol rejects Italy’s defense that there is no causal link between the measures and the

t,380

demise of Eskosol’s Projec as well as Italy’s reliance on Plama with respect to the non-

responsibility of States for the consequences of normal business risk.**!

namely that the losses are the “normal, foreseeable or proximate consequences of the unlawful

As a result, Eskosol argues, all it has to show is that the measures
caused the harm incurred, not that they were the sole cause.>** Eskosol relies on CME to the
effect that “causation arises if the damage or disadvantage deriving from the deprivation of
the legal safety of the investment is foreseeable and occurs in a normal sequence of events.”>*>
It notes that “Italy foresaw the gravity of the damages that investors in the solar PV sector
would incur especially during the period leading up to the enactment of the Romani Decree,

where there was much debate about the consequences of its enactment.”?*°

Eskosol rejects Italy’s allegation that the project failed because it was “plagued by undue
business risk.”**” According to Eskosol, the fact that it was seeking 80% financing is of no
consequence, as this debt-to-equity ratio is standard for these types of PV projects. Moreover,
Eskosol invested €41.8 million of its own capital to this project and was planning to invest
another €80 million. It also rejects Italy’s allegation that Eskosol suffered from financial
difficulties before the Romani Decree appeared, for which Italy relies only on the fact that the
first payment to Siemens was not made. Eskosol notes that Professor Delfanti withdrew this
point at the Hearing, and agreed that this payment was not missed but rather postponed, by
agreement of Siemens and Eskosol, to 28 February 2011. Eskosol says that “by the time that
payment was due on 28 February 2011, Italy’s Conto Energia system was already starting to
collapse.”*** Moreover, Eskosol notes that Unicredit “had a vested interest in completing
these negotiations as it already had furnished a €6.1 million loan agreement to SIB to construct
the substations, the payment back of which depended on the success of the Eskosol

Project.”°°°

Rather, what caused the project to fail, in Eskosol’s view, was the “unfair and unanticipated
increase in regulatory risk that Italy suddenly created when it altered the criteria for qualifying
for FiTs just as Eskosol was securing financing.”**? In support of this proposition, Eskosol
cites Mr. Stein’s witness statement in the B/usun case, where he referred to a number of letters
received between March and May 2011 from different financial institutions that declined to
finance the project due to regulatory uncertainty.*?! Indeed, Eskosol notes that “until 12 May

99392

2011, when CE IV appeared, the new FiTs were not even known. It also refers to certain

public statements made by Italian members of Parliament and the EU.°

Eskosol says that the project was not viable under Conto Energia IV. It recalls that, in order
to qualify for these incentives, it not only would have had to register the plants by 30 June
2011 (which it did), but also to complete construction of the plants by 28 March 2012, as a
result of the Romani Decree’s 10% rule for plants built on agricultural land.*** At the same
time, Eskosol argues, financing to complete the construction was unavailable for several
reasons. Among these reasons is that under Conto Energia IV, the Eskosol Project faced a
drastic reduction in profitability (of at least 31%) relative to Conto Energia III. According to
Eskosol’s experts, the Equity IRR of the project would have been reduced from 21.1% under
Conto Energia III to 8.9% under Conto Energia IV, even on a ceteris paribus basis, i.e.,

without taking into account the regulatory uncertainty generated by the Romani Decree.*?

Eskosol further argues that Conto Energia IV included a “maximum payment mechanism”
and eliminated the 14-month sunset period that had existed under Conto Energia III, which

undermined the bankability and feasibility of the project.*”°

Eskosol says that Italy “offers no evidence to substantiate its claim [that] other entrepreneurs

were facing similar circumstances as Eskosol” or that Eskosol still should have been able to

succeed under Conto Energia IV.*” It challenges Italy’s reliance on tables showing: (i) how
much capacity was generated in total by plants of all sizes operating under each Conto Energia
scheme, I, II, III, IV and V (R-38); and (ii) identifying only the quantity of energy generated
under Conto Energia II by plants of different sizes located in various regions (R-39).*”
Eskosol also challenges certain data Italy provided on the bases that it was specifically
generated for this arbitration, and that Italy failed to indicate the sources used to compile the
data or produce the underlying material.*”
301. In particular, Eskosol challenges Italy’s reliance on pages 8-11 of R-40, arguing that it does
not show that Eskosol could have been profitable because “the plant clusters discussed therein

are not in any way comparable to Eskosol.”4°? Eskosol argues as follows:

it is not clear whether the plants comprising the Blasi and Casignano clusters were
owned and operated by one entity. By contrast, Eskosol owned and operated 120
plants. The construction of 120 solar plants is not the same as building and financing
a single solar plant, especially considering that none of the 120 plants in the project
could be connected to the national grid without financing the required connection
works, including the substations.

Further, none of the Blasi and Casignano plants was apparently responsible for
building the substations or the connection rings. Instead, an entity called Energia
Uno financed and oversaw the construction of the connection works. This document
does not explain who Energia Uno is, what financial arrangement it had with each of
the 71 individual plants it helped to connect, or how it obtained the financing to
construct the substations and build the grid that connected the individual plants to
one another.“

302. Additionally, Eskosol argues that it could not have met the agricultural requirements imposed
by the Romani Decree. Eskosol’s business plan was for each of the projected 120 power plants
to occupy 50% of the land on which they were based. This could not be altered, and the project

could not be constructed in time to meet the exception provided for by the Romani Decree,

i.e., by the 28 March 2012 deadline, because Italy’s actions made arranging financing for that

. » 2
construction impossible.*”

In that regard, Eskosol takes issue with the requirement under Conto Energia IV to register
all plants entering into operation after 31 August 2011 on a national register administered by
the GSE as a precondition to receive the incentivizing tariffs. Eskosol registered the plants “to
mitigate its damages” but “the approval process was lengthy and riddled with problems.”*°
The list published by the GSE on 15 July 2011 included 115 of Eskosol’s 120 plants, but this
list was not final. There were two other lists, one on 12 August and the final one on 16
September 2011, which included 113 of Eskosol’s plants. In Eskosol’s view, “[n]o investor
would agree to finance the Eskosol project before or during the time that GSE continued to
finalize its list of plants eligible to receive incentives,” and “[s]ix months was not enough

time” after the list was finalized to complete construction.**

Eskosol also mentions that, in October 2011, Messrs. Scognamiglio and Sisto “approached
local subcontractors to build and connect 60 power plants in exchange for payments after the
plants were connected to the grid,” but “no subcontractor would agree to build the 60 plants
given the uncertainty in the solar market created by Italy’s actions.”*°> One month later, they
tried to build 27 plants “with the aim of selling them to satisfy Eskosol’s debts,” but they
received little interest from lenders.**° A final attempt to build two plants also failed because
the Italian authorities “inappropriately interfered with their construction attempt, and a stop
work order was issued. By the time the court order had sorted out this issue, ruling in Blusun’s

favour in early March, it was too late to meet the 28 March 2012 deadline.”*°”

but turned down** — Eskosol replies that “the evidence Italy cites in support of its claim does
not demonstrate that any such offers were concrete, let alone viable.”*” Eskosol points out
that a letter from Engyco on which Italy in part relies did not indicate either how many plants
it wished to purchase or an actual offer amount. Regarding another letter from Elyseum,
Eskosol notes that this “does not contain the amount of the specific offer or any other specific

terms,” and was subject to conditions that made it unacceptable.*!°

ti. Eskosol’s failure to qualify for the FiT incentives

Eskosol relies on a series of legal authorities to further argue that:

the Treaty does not protect only the legitimate expectations of investors whose
investments have been fully realized and/or who are already receiving benefits to
which they claim to be entitled; instead, the legitimate expectations of the investor
are tied to and inextricably linked to the moment that the investor makes an
investment."!

In its view, Eskosol’s legitimate expectations were based on the stability of the regulatory
framework governing the solar PV sector in Italy, on which it relied. It had a legitimate
expectation that it would have access to and be able to benefit from the FiTs under Conto
Energia III for its full term. The fact that Italy terminated Conto Energia III before Eskosol’s
investment was fully realized does not mean that Eskosol lost its Treaty protections and can

no longer assert a claim based on its legitimate expectations.*!*

Moreover, Italy cannot claim
that because Eskosol’s plants never entered into operation there was no existing investment
at the time Conto Energia III was terminated. There is no dispute that Eskosol had a protected

investment under Articles 1(7) and 1(6) of the ECT.*!

Eskosol also cites authorities to the effect that its investment must be viewed holistically,

especially because “many of the investment’s early stages, including obtaining the permits

b. Italy’s failure to provide a stable and predictable legal
framework

309. Relying on the preamble of the ECT as well as on investment arbitration jurisprudence*!> and
scholarly works,*!° Eskosol contends that the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article
10(1) of the ECT also includes the obligation to provide a reasonably stable and predictable
legal and business framework. More specifically, Eskosol argues that host States should
refrain from changing regulation or policy that would adversely and substantially affect

investors’ rights stemming from commitments made by the State through its laws.*!”

310. Eskosol contends that Italy had traditionally provided a stable legal and regulatory framework,
and that Eskosol was positioned through its efforts and investments to secure the right to the
incentivizing tariffs provided in Conto Energia III. It had all permits in place and was on target

to meet the schedule set out in the EPC Contract, and it was also engaged in advance funding

discussions with the Unicredit Syndicate.*!®

2011 and, through the enactment of the Romani Decree, terminated the incentivizing tariffs

set out in Conto Energia III just five months after it went into effect, on 31 May 2011.4!
Eskosol says that the key reason for Minister Romani to suddenly end Conto Energia III was
the unexpected consequence of the Salva Alcoa Act, which created a huge and unexpected
amount of FiTs. These consequences were unexpected and unknown until late January

2011.47

Eskosol argues that the premature termination of Conto Energia II was contrary to the
stability required under international law, and that the renewable energy sector was left in the
dark about what scheme, if any, would replace Conto Energia III, because the Romani Decree
anticipated a reduction in the incentivized tariffs but under unknown conditions.””! This
created great uncertainty among the banks that had funded projects in the solar PV sector in
Italy and put at risk the financing of new projects, as expressed by the Association of Foreign

Banks in Italy and several members of Italy’s Chamber of Deputies at the time.‘?”

Eskosol argues that Conto Energia IV caused further instability by eliminating the sunset
clause and slashing incentivizing tariffs “by as much as 30% in some cases in comparison to

the relevant tariffs under Conto Energia III.’”47

c. Italy’s failure to act transparently

Eskosol also contends that the fair and equitable treatment obligation of Article 10(1) of the
ECT includes the obligation to act transparently,*** as defined by the tribunals in Metalclad

and Tecmed.**

Eskosol contends that Italy’s Government officials told potential investors that the then-
existing Conto Energia scheme was stable and confirmed Italy’s commitment to the
development of PV energy in Italy in its Action Plan in June 2011 and in meetings with Mr.
Scognamiglio.*”° Subsequent changes left Eskosol “without any ability to understand what, if
any, incentives Eskosol would be able to secure under the forthcoming Conto Energia IV.”4?”
Eskosol contends that this amounted to a failure to act transparently and hence a violation of

Italy’s fair and equitable treatment obligations.

d. Italy’s inconsistent conduct

Eskosol also contends, based on certain investment arbitration jurisprudence, that the fair and
equitable treatment obligation of Article 10(1) of the ECT requires States to act

consistently.**

According to Eskosol, it was given both public and individual assurances as to the stability of
the regulatory framework in the solar PV sector.*?° However, one day after the publication of
the Guide to Conto Energia III, the Government released documents arguing for the revision
of the incentivizing tariffs. One month later, with the publication of the Third Draft Romani
Decree, it became apparent that the support scheme would be wiped out. The Romani Decree
then declared that the incentivizing tariffs under Conto Energia III would end on 31 May
2011, effectively abrogating the applicable ceiling and sunset protection mechanism.**? This
inconsistent behavior “destroyed the economic foundations” of the project, rendering project

financing unlikely.**!

[The foreign investor] expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally
transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and
regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative
practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State
actions conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued,
or the resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations.

e. Italy’s arbitrary and unreasonable conduct

318. Eskosol argues that the fair and equitable treatment obligation also includes a protection

against arbitrary and unreasonable conduct, as defined by investment arbitration jurisprudence
and the ICJ, i.e., a “willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks or ... surprises
a sense of judicial propriety.”**? Eskosol also rejects Italy’s reliance on Parkerings, which in
its view imposes a prohibition on the State from acting unfairly, unreasonably or inequitably

in the exercise of its legislative power.***

319. In Eskosol’s view, Italy’s revocation of the incentivizing tariff was arbitrary and unreasonable

for two reasons.

320. First, the revocation “failed to pursue a legitimate objective.” In the Claimant’s view, Italy’s

statements about the alleged “excessive” growth of the PV sector were based on false
assumptions.** Instead, according to Eskosol, the subsequent decrees were motivated by the

pressure of the nuclear energy lobbies.**°

321. Second, in Eskosol’s view, the Romani Decree’s requirement that PV power plants occupying

more than 10% of agricultural land must be connected to the grid within one year, in order to
be eligible even for the (reduced) incentivizing tariffs under the future Conto Energia IV, was
itself arbitrary and unreasonable, as it lacked any reasonable justification.**° Eskosol contends
that this requirement, which was extremely damaging to its project and undermined its ability

to secure funding, constituted a violation of the FET obligation in the ECT.

f. Italy’s disproportionate conduct

Eskosol further argues that the fair and equitable treatment obligation entails an analysis of
the proportionality of the State conduct, and argues that the State conduct must be “reasonably

related and appropriately narrow to address a legitimate State interest.”4>”

In its view, Italy did not act proportionately because it failed to assess the effect of the
legislative change on foreign investments and to balance the interest of the State with the
burden imposed on foreign investment.*** Eskosol asserts that the dismantling of Conto
Energia III was “a facade to justify the Italian Government’s attempt to introduce nuclear
energy in Italy,” and affected legitimate investors like Eskosol which had nothing to do with
any abuse regarding the Salva Alcoa Act.*? Moreover, Italy was well aware of the
consequences the measures would have on the projects in the sector,*#° and of the

inconsistency of the measures with its commitments to the European Union.**!

Eskosol finally contends that Italy’s justification for the adoption of the Romani Decree was
groundless as, a few months after declaring that growth towards the previous national target
of 8,000 MW had been excessive, the Government “changed course and announced a new
objective of 23,000 MW of solar PV energy.”““? The measures were thus in breach of the

FET standard for being disproportionate.

2. Italy’s Position

Italy contends that the reference in the first sentence of the ECT’s Article 10(1) to creating
attractive “conditions for Investors ... to make Investments,” while helpful to the

interpretation of the whole clause, is hardly autonomous from those that follow in the same

provision.‘ In any event, Eskosol’s case rests on an alleged breach of the second sentence
of Article 10(1), by alleging that Italy engaged in specific unfair or inequitable conduct. In
advancing this argument, Italy explains that Eskosol targets the Romani Decree and Conto
Energia IV insofar as they allegedly rolled back benefits that were available under Conto
Energia III, and therefore Eskosol’s claim does not go to the stability of the Italian regulatory
system over the years or allege any systemic unreliability of Italian law at large, but rather
concems one principal event: the lowering of the tariffs that Eskosol hoped to receive for the

planned plants.

Italy notes the lack of definition of FET in the ECT. In its opinion, the Tribunal should
interpret the standard in accordance with the standard of protection of aliens and their property
under customary international law and arbitral practice.*45 More specifically, Italy argues that
the FET standard “‘is a corollary of good faith and fairness, not an insurance policy against
business mishaps.”*“° Thus, the core of the analysis “is not the inconvenience of the measures
perceived by the single investor, but their objective fairness assessed in light of the

circumstances.”44”

a. The notion of legitimate expectations

Italy objects to the notion of legitimate expectations adopted by Eskosol. It states that Eskosol
“takes for granted that the ‘FET standard contains a prohibition against host States conduct
that violates the legitimate expectations that an investor has when it makes an investment.””*“*
In Italy’s view, by contrast, Article 10(1) ECT contains no such prohibition. What might
constitute a breach of the FET obligation are specific instances of State conduct that are unfair
or inequitable. “Among such instances, it is certainly possible that a breach result[s] from acts

that destroy investor’s interests that had been generated through specific State promises or

representations,” but no interpretation of the applicable legal test can dispense with the actual

ascertainment of whether unfairness or inequity occurred.”

Italy argues that “[e]xpectations are representations of facts and rules that investors derive
from the conduct of the authorities of the State. Reliance on these representations can be
critical to the decision to make an investment and how to shape it. These expectations must
be legitimate: not all expectations deserve protection under the ECT, but only those that have

a legal backing, are specific to the investment, and are reasonable.”4°°

According to Italy, in Eskosol’s construction “the standard expands almost indefinitely to
protect the expectation that certain rights will be available for acquisition, and in a particular
format, in the future.”*>! Yet “[nJone of the few cases in which legitimate expectations were
successfully invoked found a State’s obligation to guarantee that an investor could acquire
certain rights that had been available at a previous time also at a later time, and under the same

conditions.”4>?

Indeed, in all the cases Eskosol cited, “the regulatory change deteriorated the
position of investors that already were subject to the State measures and counted on their
continued application in the future,” which is “certainly not the case [of Eskosol] which ...

never [qualified] under Conto Energia III.”*>

Italy further argues that Eskosol makes the determination of unfairness or inequity an
automatic consequence of any disappointment of the expectations. In its view, however,
“whether any breach of expectations is unfair and inequitable cannot be taken for granted, but
is precisely what needs to be looked into to assess the State’s compliance with the FET
standard.”*** In consequence, Eskosol cannot say that every time that an expectation is not
fully respected there is a breach of the treaty. “[W]hat matters is not just the entity of the

disrespect, but also all the other factors that might point to its being fair (the circumstances,

the proportionality with respect to its professed goals, the foreseeability) or not.”**> Indeed,
even when a violation of an investor’s legitimate expectation is found, the breach of the FET

standard depends on some crucial additional findings.**°

On the issue of legitimate expectations, Italy contends that the awards on which Eskosol relies
are not pertinent to the facts of this case.*5” In Saluka, for example, “the tribunal concluded
that, in the framework of the Czech Republic’s open plan to align its regulations to EU
standards, the regulatory change should have been anticipated: the investor was ‘not justified
to expect that the [host State] would not introduce a more rigid system of prudential regulation
and thereby change the framework for Nomura’s investment.’”*** In fact, in Saluka, the only
breach that the tribunal found was discrimination, of which there is no suggestion in the
present case. In Italy’s view, Tecmed does not support Eskosol’s case either, as there the host
State “had first granted and then refused to renew the operating license, making it factually
impossible for the investor to pursue its business, not just less profitable.”4°° Here Italy did
not provide any specific guarantee to Eskosol, and never precluded it from implementing the
project.* Italy also distinguishes this case from the investment cases against Argentina,
which involved ongoing business concerns subject to precise State obligations contained in
concession agreements signed with the investors.*°! Here, the passage from Conto Energia III
to Conto Energia IV constituted “a modulation” of the profits guaranteed under the incentives
regime, “not an evisceration of any operating profitable business.”* As the Blusun tribunal
noted, Italy had “still relatively generous levels of FiTs” after the transition from Conto

Energia III to Conto Energia IV.*%

Italy further challenges Eskosol’s reliance on Micula, as in that case Romania eliminated tax

tariffs available for future applicants.*™ Italy also distinguishes this case from Eiser, where
the investor had built and operated the plants, and its plants were formally registered to receive

benefits under the applicable regime.*®

b. The causal link

Italy contends that there is no causal link between the measures the Government adopted and
the failure of the Eskosol Project. It states that Eskosol’s plan to build between 113 and 120
operative plants in Puglia was “at most very hopeful, but at least far from granted,” and cites
Blusun to the effect that the “success [of the project] was by no means certain.”*” Italy also
says that the “Claimant’s shareholders made a hopeful but fatal double bet: they assumed that
they would find a sponsor, and that the incentives available at the time of their initial

467 However,

investment would be still available, in the same exact amount, some years later.
at no time did they qualify for the incentives, either under Conto Energia III or under any of
those offered by the following measures. Italy adds that “[iJt is not particularly surprising that
banks refused to fund such plan.”*°* Indeed, Italy notes that one should not underestimate that
lenders had a wide choice of less risky projects to fund, in the same years and in the same

region as Eskosol’s Project.*”

Italy explains that “the adverse effect is an essential element of a FET breach, not just a
precondition for the damage that it might have caused.”4”° Therefore, Italy argues, Eskosol
bears the burden of proving the existence of any alleged detrimental effect on its investment
following from Italy’s conduct.*”! However, Italy criticizes Eskosol for having failed to

produce convincing impartial evidence to back its arguments on causation, arguing that

Eskosol relies exclusively on partial accounts such as the views of its own directors and

evidence produced by its experts specifically to support its arbitration claim.*””

Italy further argues that even if (arguendo) Italy had promised Eskosol that the incentives
would not change at all (which Italy denies), and even if the transition from Conto Energia III
to Conto Energia IV arguendo breached that promise, Eskosol still could not have been

affected by that, for two reasons.

First, Eskosol never qualified under any incentive scheme. Eskosol never commissioned the
plants during the time that Conto Energia III had indicated for its sunset application, nor does
the record demonstrate that it was clearly in position to do so, based on arrangements already
put in place as of the time the Romani Decree or Conto Energia entered into effect. In fact,
the only relevant indication was the projected schedule of works of the Siemens EPC
Contract, but Eskosol did not have enough funds lined up even to make the first payment

when it became due.*”?

Second, Eskosol has not proved that the shortened availability of Conto Energia III had any
actual impact on its business plans. Italy agrees with Eskosol that “the applicable standard of
causation requires the identification of the allegedly wrongful act as the ‘operative’ or
‘proximate’ cause of the losses.”4” In Italy’s view, however, “there is no provable causation
at all.” Italy reminds the Tribunal that Eskosol’s president himself explained in 2012 that the
“preponderant” circumstance that led to Eskosol’s failure was the unexpected
unresponsiveness of the banks. In its view, Italy’s acts “could have been secondary or

marginally determinants of Eskosol’s demise, at most.”47>

In Italy’s view, nothing indicates that Eskosol’s funding negotiation with Unicredit (which
Italy sees as Eskosol’s “only remotely plausible funding negotiation”) was actually disrupted

by the regulatory changes. The Romani Decree was adopted after Unicredit already had pulled

out of the talks, and after Eskosol already had failed to make the first down payment to
Siemens.*”° Italy rejects as not credible any suggestion that Unicredit’s commitment to
approve a loan to SIB for €6 million demonstrates the likelihood of its granting a loan at least
57 times larger (€340 million), in collaboration with other banks yet to be found.*”’ Moreover,
Italy notes that, in spite of Mr. Scognamiglio’s statement that Eskosol had talked with 26
banks during the development of the Eskosol Project, no more than a preliminary term sheet
by West LB can be found in the records. Moreover, this document shows that “Eskosol needed
financing by January 15" 2011 and that time was too tight to permit to reasonably respect
such term[s] at the stage of negotiations.”*”* It also notes that, in spite of Dr. Stickel’s
suggestion that other funding forms such as bridge loans were available, no evidence was

submitted to that end.*”

Italy further contends that the ability of many other investors to take advantage of the Conto
Energia IV incentives, as well as the transitional safeguards of the Romani Decree, rule out
any possibility that these regulatory changes themselves determined the collapse of the
Eskosol Project.**° To the contrary, Italy notes, the B/usun tribunal concluded that “the Puglia
Project was already in significant financial difficulty in the first months of 2011, and

independently of the Romani Decree.”**!

Indeed, Italy highlights the following “striking” differences with respect to the causation
arguments advanced by Blusun and Eskosol in the two arbitrations, which Italy suggests is
indicative of the speculative nature of Eskosol’s claims:

Blusun did not make much of the Unicredit negotiation that Claimant now stressed

as being the critical make-it-or-break-it juncture in its story of business failure.

Blusun did not describe Decreto Romani as fatal to their industrial plan.

Blusun confirmed that Conto Energia IV offered a viable business environment that
in many respects improved the existing regulatory regime and could guarantee
satisfactory profits."

In Italy’s telling of the story, it was Eskosol’s own business decision that led to the failure of
its project through a lack of necessary funding. Italy suggests that the problem was Eskosol’s
plan “to pack a mega project on paper, develop its supporting facilities on the ground and
attract third-party investors, rather than build the batches of plants gradually.”4** Italy
contends that Mr. Stein essentially admitted as much, in a report accompanying Eskosol’s
balance sheet for the year 2011:
The motives and circumstances for that outcome [the project’s failure leading to the
company’s insolvency], which is certainly not exciting, are ascribable to a negative
conjuncture. A legislation in constant evolution for more than 18 months (with
occasional retroactive effects) applied to a complex and large project, which lacked

a perfect alignment of all its specific components and participants (whose goals and
purposes were not always harmonious) [.]

Finally, but with devastating and preponderant effect, we must mention the absolute
failure to provide any external financial support by the banks, which are supposed
to facilitate and make projects such as Eskosol’s possible.**

Italy contends that Eskosol “cut corners” to “circumvent[] the prohibition” on using
administrative shortcuts for plants of MW or more; “designed a bigger-than-ever solar field
for an area without pre-existing infrastructures; discounted the regulatory risks that were
obviously looming and sought to sell the project as a ready-to-make investment, before the
plants were even built or the panels sourced.”**> Italy also notes that Eskosol had “virtually
no equity, compared to the total cost of the enterprise (north of €300 million),” it planned to
borrow all the necessary money, and planned to do all that in record time.*** In Italy’s view,
“the destination was secure, but the journey was hazardous: Claimant chose a steep and risky
all-or-nothing path to achieve a very safe place. Claimant’s investment was the project, not

the solar field.”**’ Italy agrees with Eskosol that “turnkey projects are a favourite of investors,

given the low inherent risks. Yet they are [a] challenge for developers — like Claimant.”*** It
contends that Eskosol “attempted to justify the functionality of the industrial plan and its
financial underpinnings but systematically failed to address the elephant in the room: the scale
and design of the project were Claimant’s own business choices.”**? The same holds true for

the financial design of the project.”

Italy also criticizes Eskosol for trying to blame ENEL for its business decisions, by referring
to ENEL’s request that the plants be connected to the grid through two substations, or by
attributing to ENEL the original suggestion of a partnership among separate SPVs. In Italy’s
view, this is an attempt “to divert the Tribunal’s attention from [Eskosol’s] own
entrepreneurial choice and somehow suggest that the design of the project is attributable to
the Respondent.”*?! Italy explains that: ENEL is not Italy; ENEL did not and could not
“require” anything; and even assuming that ENEL had suggested or proposed any course of
action, this would have been in response to Eskosol’s request, with a view to accommodate

Eskosol’s “purely self-created needs.”4°*

Italy further challenges Eskosol’s assertion that the
project needed to be large. In its view, the size of the project was a business choice, and the
fact “[t]hat a project needed to be so huge to break even and produce any profits suggests that
it was financially fragile.”*°? The project was not “robust” because “nobody was ready to

finance it.”4*

Italy contends that the project simply did not attract interest from investors, unlike a “legion
of investors in the same business which appeared to make better choices and achieve
success.”“9> Ultimately, Italy says, whether the plan was marketable “must be assessed

ascertaining the response of the market.”4°°

Italy criticizes, in particular, Eskosol’s lack of coordination between its EPC Contract with
Siemens and its negotiation of potential financing deals. Italy contends that the normal
sequencing of works would have been to finalize the grid and the plants together, even if work
on the grid might have been started earlier than on the plants.*”” Eskosol’s odd sequencing, in
which it focused exclusively on the electrical substations needed to connect to the grid before
beginning any construction whatsoever of the PV plants themselves, was inevitable (in Italy’s
view) only because Eskosol could not finance the construction of the plants. Eskosol “could
sign [the EPC Contract] for free but knew too well it could not pay for [it].”4"* Italy suggests

that Eskosol needed the EPC Contract to attract financing for the project.*”

Italy notes Eskosol’s observation that the new regulatory framework under Conto Energia IV
“would have impacted the equity/debt ratio and the relevant interest rate of the envisaged
financing,” but highlights that Eskosol “could not assert that the benefits in Conto Energia IV
were unavailable or insufficient as such.”*°° Indeed, Italy asserts that Eskosol “drew a blank
on the more reasonable inference: Conto Energia IV would work for most investors, so it
cannot be held to be investment-crippling as such.”*"' Italy thus highlights that “the project’s
own idiosyncratic fragility made it vulnerable to otherwise harmless circumstances,” and
notes that “[Eskosol’s] shareholders’ admissions are more honest and concede the financial
soundness of Conto Energia IV.”°°? Indeed, Italy notes that Eskosol’s shareholders explained
that they intended to “maintain and pursue Eskosol’s business under Conto Energia IV —
which they praised —, and that the plan failed because of certain subsequent acts that lie outside
the scope of the present dispute. [Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein considered] that the project was

viable and could have obtained financing under Conto Energia IV."°

According to Italy, Siemens did not endorse Eskosol’s excuse for not paying the initial

installment on the EPC Contract. In its view, the EPC side letter may have meant that Eskosol

technically was not in “an already certifiable situation of default,” but it still “reflected
[Eskosol’s] lack of funds and impending troubles to find a financial sponsor (which
incidentally was a contractual breach in its own right).”*™* Italy also highlights that, while
Eskosol argues that “[nJot a single lender would touch Eskosol’s project after the ... ‘State

Measures’, [that] is precisely what had happened also before the challenged measures.”

Italy makes several additional comments regarding Eskosol’s financial difficulties. First, with
respect to Eskosol’s remark that the 2009 economic crisis led the banking industry to adopt a
restrictive policy on lending, Italy suggests that the remark may have been “aimed at shifting
blame away from Claimant [but], more importantly, shifts it also away from Respondent.”>°°
Second, Eskosol’s reference to certain lawsuits by creditors which affected its reputation with

lenders “has absolutely nothing to do with Italy’s actions.”°°”

With respect to Eskosol’s complaint about the Romani Decree’s restriction on agricultural
land, Italy makes several points.>*°* It notes first that Eskosol’s Memorial only mentioned this
complaint in passing in a footnote, with the result that Eskosol’s later accusation that “Italy
does not address this issue at all in its Counter-Memorial” verges on the absurd. On the
substance, Italy highlights that “the requirements relating to the use of agricultural land did
not apply until 28 March 2012 (one year after the entry into force of the [Romani] Decree).”>°
It also notes that by that date it was no longer required that plants already be in operation to
qualify for incentives, but only they be tested and connected to the grid. If Eskosol had had a
viable project, “the construction of the plants could have been completed in time to be spared
from the new regime on agricultural land.”>!° Indeed, Italy observes, Eskosol itself contends
that “administrative and permitting work took about 80%/90% of the total time required to

complete a solar PV plant,” so if that is true then the time available before March 2012 should

have been sufficient for Eskosol to carry out the remaining 10% of the work.*!! In fact, Italy
contends, the record shows Eskosol’s “repeated attempts at constructing the plants in 2011,
which failed for lack of financing.”>'? In Italy’s view, the fact that Eskosol “put efforts and
money in the attempts to build the plants and accede the incentives under Conto Energia IV
is enough evidence to reject the assertion ... that it was impossible to do so in time.”>" Italy
also points out that Eskosol “did finally decide to split construction of the plants and was thus
able to find financing for smaller clusters, which it yet refused as not sufficiently
interesting.”*'* Italy also notes that Eskosol “hired Capitale Systéme Investissement to

promote the Project under Conto Energia IV and undertake some road shows.”*!5

Italy rejects on a number of other grounds Eskosol’s argument that the Romani Decree caused
the destruction of the investment. First, Italy says that Eskosol’s references to the views of
Italian MPs and newspaper articles are immaterial: “[a]ny predictions that the Decreto Romani
would cripple the industry proved to be exaggerated, and the hard data of the legions of
investments that kept benefitting from Conto Energia IV and the later schemes must supersede
any contemporaneous expression of discontent.”*!® In this regard, Italy refers again to the

GSE documents showing the results of the different Conto Energia decrees.

Second, Italy defends its argument that the success of other power plants demonstrates that
Eskosol’s Project failed for reasons other than the regulatory changes. On this issue, Italy
dismisses Eskosol’s suggestion that the GSE tables Italy submitted about other plants have
“authenticity issues,” arguing that the GSE customarily collects information from all power
plants and makes it available online so all investors can consult it.*!7 Italy also rejects
Eskosol’s emphasis on differences in size and design of the different projects, making two
points. The first is that Eskosol’s argument actually confirms Italy’s position, which “the

tribunal in B/usun understood with ease,” that the main determinant of Eskosol’s failure was

353.

its atypical size.*'* In Italy’s view, Eskosol’s suspicion that the plants in Blasi and Casignano
had lower connection costs reinforces the point that Eskosol’s plan was “risky, expensive, and
subject to size-determinative atypical fragility, compared to industry’s standards”;*!? the
Blasi-Casignano example is the best evidence that a significant project could have been done,
in the same geographical area and at the very same point in time, despite the adoption of the
Romani Decree.*” Italy’s second point is that any distinctions between Eskosol’s Project and
the others simply highlight Eskosol’s plan to circumvent the law: while Eskosol sought to
take advantage of administrative shortcuts reserved for small plants of less than 1 MW, and
to receive the higher incentives reserved for these small plants, its plan in reality has always
consisted of building one big complex of 120 connected plants, which entailed immense
regulatory risks, as noted both by potential investors and by the B/usun tribunal.*”! Italy notes,
in this regard, the contradictions between Eskosol’s story in this proceeding and that told by

the claimants in the Blusun case.>””

Italy also suggests that Eskosol received concrete offers of funding that were turned down,
suggesting that, therefore, the decision to abandon the project was better understood as a

business choice rather than an act of necessity.*?*

In summary, relying on Plama, Italy argues that Eskosol’s lack of success with investors “falls
squarely under the category of business risk.”*24 The case is thus completely different in its
view from those on which Eskosol relies, such as Inmaris (where the host State banned the
investor from using its investment altogether) and Lemire (where the host State made it illegal
for the investor to operate its business), in both cases the State thereby having directly caused
the subsequent loss of profits.°”° Unlike those cases, Italy suggests, here the Tribunal should

reach the same conclusions as the B/usun tribunal, namely that:

355.

In a context in which Blusun’s failure to construct the plants or to connect them to
the grid was due to its own investment decisions, notably its failure to attract
adequate finance, Italy should not be required to pick up the tab for Blusun’s
failures.*°°

c. Eskosol’s failure to qualify for the FiT incentives

One of Italy’s core arguments is that Eskosol “cannot claim to have made the investment
based on expectations regarding the persistence of a future opportunity to acquire some rights.
The expectation that certain rights be maintained and respected is at the core of the FET

standard. The expectation to acquire specific rights in the future is not.”°?’

As noted above, Italy emphasizes that in this case, Eskosol never acquired rights to the Conto
Energia III benefits, because it never complied with the legal requirements set by the law:
“[ijt had no legitimate expectations upon which it could claim to have made its investment.”>”
That distinction is important under the jurisprudence, which not only provides that “legitimate
expectations must be assessed at the time of the making of the investment,” but also
recognizes that expectations with respect to some benefits arises only when the investor has
complied with the requirements to obtain those benefits.*”° In this case, Italy argues, “at the
time in which Claimant made the investment (or at no other time) Eskosol did not qualify for
the benefits, nor was the receiving of the benefits imminent or even expectable with any
certainty. The change in regulations affected Eskosol’s putative plans but did not deteriorate
its rights, nor did it frustrate any specific expectation backed by Italy’s reassurance.”**°
According to Italy, Eskosol was never in the position to fulfil the stipulated conditions to
access a promised benefit, so this case is not about the unexpected removal or diminution of
such benefits, or about a change in the requirements to access them. Rather, Eskosol “has not

complied with the conditions prevailing at the time of making the investment.”**!

Spain, ICSID ARB/14/1, Award, 16 May 2018, RL-90 (“Masdar”), where the tribunal found a breach of legitimate
expectations related to benefits that the investor already had acquired by complying with the necessary requirements
(see Rejoinder, 44 255-256).

359.

In its Rejoinder, Italy clarified that it does not suggest that because the Eskosol Project did
not come to fruition, Eskosol was not a protected investor. Rather, Italy’s argument is that
“Claimant’s investment consisted of its assets and its development plan for a solar field, minus
its actual construction. It certainly did not consist of a solar field with operating plants.”*?

Italy adds that:

[t]he investment, as a whole, as a process, existed and was protected under the ECT.
It never developed as Claimant intended and never qualified for some available
benefits. These benefits were never discontinued, and even after their window of
availability was shortened, Claimant’s investment still did not qualify for them, or
for any subsequent one. ... To view one investment holistically means to consider
all its existing parts, not also the inexistent ones.**

d. The lack of any promise that regulations would not change

In Italy’s view, “[a] State’s regulatory autonomy is particularly pronounced with respect to
general regulatory measures, as opposed to specific acts and decisions addressing one
investor.”*** It argues that, unlike the facts in certain other investor-state disputes, Italy made
no promise to Eskosol that its laws would not change. In these circumstances, Italy invites the
Tribunal to agree with the finding in B/usun that “a reasonable market expectation as to some
state of affairs, justified or not, is not a basis for shifting risks to the public sector, i.e. the state

9535

budget.

Italy argues that Conto Energia III contained no guarantee against regulatory change. The 14-
month deadline included in Conto Energia III
governed the application of the incentives, not the validity or effectiveness of the
decree. As long as Conto Energia III contained a deadline for obtaining its benefits,
applications for incentives needed to comply with that deadline. The tariff deadline

did not freeze Italy’s regulatory measure; it was not a promise that Conto Energia
III could not change or be repealed until May 2012.°%°

Italy further contends that the “primary function of the sunset clause was ... to prevent

regulatory voids. It was assumed that, as it regularly happened, the regulator would pass a

115

new scheme every time the previous one run [sic] its course. Yet, the sunset clauses allowed
the government to operate with ease, rather than having to rush with no notice to preserve the
continuity of the incentives.”>*” Italy further notes that Conto Energia III previously cut short
the sunset period of Conto Energia II, so Eskosol could have had no legitimate expectation
that the Conto Energia III sunset period could never be affected by future regulation.***
Moreover, the extension of the incentives for some plants under the Salva Alcoa law was until
30 June 2011, still earlier than the original sunset clause.*? In Italy’s view, these prior changes
to the periods over which certain provisions would apply demonstrated that the adoption of
Conto Energia IV, and the disposal of the sunset provision in Conto Energia III, were neither

unprecedented nor impossible to have previously contemplated.**?
360. In its Post-Hearing Brief, Italy further explained that,

[t]hrough [the Salva Alcoa Law] Italy then permitted to apply the tariffs of Conto
Energia II also to plants still concluded by the end of 2010 ... but connected after
that date and before 30" June 2011. Indeed, many investors only needed to be
connected to become operational ... since delays in connections had occurred due to
the extremely high request.

The same logics and legislative technique between Conto Energia II and Conto
Energia III applies to the transition from Conto Energia III to Conto Energia IV:

- It indicated a target of 8.000 MW by 2020 and a cap of 3.000 MW maximum PV
plant’s power being allowed to apply for incentives;

- It set a 14-month period application of the Conto for plant[s] entered into operation
after the reaching of such target.

For the same reasons as for Conto Energia II, the 14-month extension would have
been applicable only in the absence of a new decree adopting new tariffs.

The cumulative power incentivized by the end of 2010 under Conto Energia I and II
was about 3.500 MW. In addition, GSE reached over 55.000 requests to access the

Salva Alcoa regime, corresponding approximately to further 3.500 MW to be
installed by the end of 2010 and ready to be connected before June 2011.*"!

Italy contends that “nothing in Conto Energia III can be construed as Italy’s promise not to
change the regulatory framework governing tariff incentives. Decreto Romani and Conto
Energia IV could, and did, modify some aspects of the ‘regulatory framework,’ never
retroactively.”**? In Italy’s view, Eskosol’s mere reliance on the deadline to apply for Conto
Energia III incentives cannot prevail over the common knowledge that incentives schemes
are subject to constant revision and that laws can change. Italy invokes the Blusun finding that
any expectations would be “even less powerful because European law had already lowered
them: it was clear that the incentives offered were subject to modification in light, inter alia,

of changing costs and improved technology.”*

Italy argues in the alternative that even if this Tribunal considered Conto Energia III as
signaling an intention not to change the law for a period of time, at most this would be a
commitment of a general nature, as opposed to one addressed specifically to Eskosol or its
investment. Italy says, quoting B/usun, that Eskosol’s argument “has the effect of treating the

law as not a general command but an individual commitment.”*“+

The only specific interaction between Italy and Eskosol was a letter dated 3 December 2010,
in which “the agency limited itself to state that it ‘believe[d]’ access to the incentives was
possible, ‘ifthe ... plants ... meet all the requirements, also technical as set forth by applicable
law,’ and ‘pursuant to the applicable provisions of law.””>+> Eskosol’s problem is that it never
met all the requirements provided by the law, which included the commissioning of the plants.
The applicable provisions of law changed, but Eskosol had not met the ones previously
applicable. “At no time did [Eskosol] receive specific assurance that its plants would benefit

from a specific FiT scheme.”*4° Moreover, Italy states that the GSE’s task is to implement

legislative and regulatory measures, but it can never give reassurance on the validity or

duration of any such measures.”

e. The predictability and reasonableness of the Romani Decree
and Conto Energia IV

Italy argues that Eskosol’s shareholders knew that incentive tariffs were (and inevitably would
continue to be) on a downward trend, and the reference in its measures to a specific cap on
incentives conveyed a relatively clear message that if growth were faster than expected, Italy
would have to take urgent steps to address the situation.*“* As noted by Italy,

the regulator’s plan was clear at all stages; the applicable rules would be adjusted

periodically to reduce the costs for the final consumers, by introducing control

mechanisms of incentive spending and by promoting the use of more cost effective
technologies (i.e., with cheaper cost per unit, in particular for solar panels). ...

As specifically for the Romani Decree, substituting Conto Energia III with Conto
Energia IV, this was adopted in the specific context of implementing a new EU
directive and in a conjuncture where thresholds had been exceeded extremely
quickly. This adjustment was made by providing a specific transitional scheme.*””

Italy refers to the Bacchiocchi witness statement, which discusses in some detail the function,
public policy rationale, gradual implementation and reasonableness of the Romani Decree and
Conto Energia IV.>*° Italy also refers to the Delfanti/Motta expert reports to assert that “the
reduction in incentives was proportionately less than the reduction in the cost of the
photovoltaic technology during 2010, and left Italian subsidy levels higher than those in

Germany, France and Spain.”**!

Italy contends that even if Eskosol had “somewhat mistakenly nurtured an expectation that
Conto Energia III could not change until May 2012,” Italy’s conduct cannot be said to have
unfairly or inequitably frustrated that expectation. This is because the adjustment was gradual;

it was accompanied by principled reasoning tying the changes to concerns to safeguard

legitimate public interests; plants that were about to be completed still could benefit from the
Conto Energia III incentives until May 2011; and Conto Energia IV was still available, albeit

with slightly lower tariffs, for those who could not make that deadline.**

Italy argues that the Conto Energia schemes “were intended to strike a specific balance
between the incentive to production and a fair remuneration of the investments. Over-
remuneration was not their goal, and constant adjustment was universally anticipated.”**> As
for the Romani Decree, this was motivated by the unexpectedly quick achievement of the
target set in Conto Energia III. Italy indicates that the peak in the growth of subsidies was
between 2010-2013, with subsidies paid by consumers to producers growing in this period
from €0.9 billion to €6.7 billion.** Italy also states that in the period 2010-2012, the national
aggregate operating power from PV plants rose from 1,906 MW to 10,796 MW (+466.42%),
and by the end of 2012 it grew further to 19,862 (an additional 74.71%), for a total increase
of 889.61% on a two-year basis.*°> According to Italy, the 11.4 TWh production projected for
2020 was already surpassed in 2012.**° In fact, Conto Energia IV was the most successful

Conto Energia of all in terms of plants installed and receiving the benefits.*°”

Italy further states that:

In January 2011, GSE communicated to the Parliament (Senato) that it estimated the
power plant installed at the end of 2010 having already reached the power of 7.000
MW. Those expectations were right since the threshold of 8.000 MW incentivized
was reached between May and June 2011. In fact, we know that at the end of 2011,
the operating power was greater than 13,000 MW.

On the other side, no claim in this regard could be opposed to Italy in relation to the
fact that the legislator did not wait for the achievement of the cap of 3,000 MW set
by Conto Energia III since:

as mentioned, the overall target of 8.000 Mw set by the Conto Energia II had already
been reached;

even assuming that the Conto would remain in force until the cap of 3.000 MW be
reached, the Claimant would not have received any benefits, given that:

i. having regard to the entry into operation of the Salva Alcoa plants to 31st May
2011, the date on which the Conto Energia III ceased to apply, the cumulative power
incentivized and installed in 2011 (Third Conto + Salva Alcoa) was well above the
limit of 3.000 MW provided by the Conto;

ii. In any case, even under the — wrong — assumption of not considering Salva Alcoa
plants, the additional 1.500 MW required to achieve the target of 3.000 MW had
been installed between July and August 2011, under Conto Energia IV.

iii. Under no perspective the Claimant could thus have been able to rely on the
applicability of Conto Energia III tariffs until mid 2012. That such cap would have
been reached by that time was clear to anyone following the publicly available data
on the trend of the market.***

Italy also rejects Eskosol’s suggestion that the later (higher) target of 23,000 MW in Conto
Energia IV demonstrates any inconsistency in Italy’s conduct. In its view, the higher target
goes hand in hand with the lower incentives.**? As for the criticism from the European
Commission to which Eskosol refers, Italy contends that it was completely superseded by
subsequent events, including the fact that the infringement procedure against the Romani

Decree was ultimately dropped.*®

f. Other aspects of Eskosol’s FET claim

With respect to Eskosol’s argument that Italy breached its FET obligation by failing to provide
a stable and predictable legal framework, failing to act transparently or consistently, and
adopting arbitrary, unreasonable and disproportionate measures, Italy challenges Eskosol’s
reliance on Occidental, CME, Metalclad, Tecmed, ELSI and Plama on the basis that these

56

cases involved abusive and targeted measures against specific investors.*°! In its view, they

do not assist Eskosol here, because

the regulatory changes made by [Italy] were gradual and reasonable. These changes
occurred while Italy looked after the updating of the incentive schemes to

developments occurring in the photovoltaic industry, financial and technological
alike. All Italian measures pursued public interests; none of them was discriminatory,
disproportionate or unreasonable.*?

In this context, Italy invokes the following passage from the B/usun award:

In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies
such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are
lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in
a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and
should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may
have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.

Italy says that “it was plausible to anticipate” that the Conto Energia III incentives might be
adjusted in the light of the rapid pace at which Italy was reaching its target of 8,000 MW of
cumulative power from photovoltaic energy, which was expected to be achieved by 2020.
According to Italy, by 2010 that objective was almost half reached, which forced the
Government to anticipate the expiry of Conto Energia III. Moreover, those plants that were

able to qualify within the next three months were left unaffected by the regulatory change.*

With respect to Eskosol’s contentions about a state of legal uncertainty existing between 3
March 2011 (the Romani Decree) and 19 April 2011 (when the “salient aspects” of the
forthcoming Conto Energia IV were announced), Italy rejects the argument that any lack of
clarity violated its treaty obligations. In its view, “Italy cannot be faulted for failing to preview
the content of future laws so long in advance of their application.”°° Moreover, the Romani
Decree foresaw a transitional period of more than a year after its publication to alleviate the
impact on a category of investors (those who already had construction permits) that would
actually be disadvantaged by the change, as they no longer would meet the new requirements

on the use of agricultural land.*°°

As to Conto Energia IV, Italy contends that it actually improved the incentives scheme in

several respects, particularly in their overall transparency, by establishing a register with the

GSE recording the plants that would receive benefits.*°’ Moreover, Italy argues that the
lowered tariffs of Conto Energia IV were “roughly predictable” if one had projected the
decreasing trend of tariff levels across the various Conto Energia decrees, and Conto Energia
IV did not affect the plants that already qualified for earlier incentives, as the new levels were
limited to future applicants.*°*

Moreover, Italy argues that in Eskosol’s case, even if it arguendo had been able to build PV
plants to the schedule in the Siemens EPC Contract — an assumption Italy suggests is
speculative given Eskosol’s financing difficulties — the diminution of the incentives applicable
to it in consequence of Conto Energia IV would have been on average 11.75%.* Admittedly,
a reduction in this range might make a difference for the viability of certain projects, but in
Italy’s view, “it would make no sense to review the objective fairness of the incentive rates,
which [are] designed to guarantee reasonable profits for the competent investors, against the
need of investors in unusually delicate circumstances.”*” Italy argues that it would be
paradoxical if the ECT were used to reward investors whose costs are so high that their
projects depend on the immutability of some “demonstrably over-rewarding scheme.”>”! That
was the situation of the Eskosol Project, Italy argues, citing one of Eskosol’s own witness

statements.*7

Italy also notes that, according to Mr. Lecorcier’s testimony in the Blusun case, “[t]he
decrease in the feed-in tariffs under the Fourth Energy Account was proportional to the
decrease in construction costs, which continually decreased due to the decrease in the price
of solar modules and solar panels.”*”> Moreover, given that by the end of 2011 plants adding

up to 13,000 MW of nominal power already were operating, and many more were in the

377. Italy further notes that almost all of Eskosol’s plants were included in the lists published by
the GSE in accordance with Conto Energia IV, and Mr. Lecorcier himself testified in the

Blusun case that the project would remain profitable under the new regime.*”>

378. Finally, Italy notes that the regulatory climate at the time did not unfairly hamper other PV

plants in the Puglia region where Eskosol had hoped to operate, because 1,400 plants in that
region secured access to the incentives in 2010-2011 alone, and as many as 90% of the
initiatives undertaken were successfully able to qualify for the incentives.*”°

3. Tribunal’s Analysis*””

a. Introductory Points

379. A significant portion of the Parties’ pleadings and arguments has been focused on the issue

of causation, namely whether Eskosol would have been able to obtain the necessary funding
to construct and complete its ambitious project, but for the State measures challenged in this
case (the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV). Italy argued that the project was inherently

risky because of Eskosol’s own business choices, whereas Eskosol argued that the project had

575 Counter-Memorial, § 346 (citing Mr. Lecorcier’s written testimony in the Blusun case, R-51, 37).

576 Counter-Memorial, § 347.

577 The Tribunal would like to note that on the matters of liability examined in the following sections of the Award,
Professor Tawil joins his co-arbitrators in their final decision but not in their analysis. In the opinion of Professor
Tawil it is highly uncertain that Claimant would have met in due time the requirements to benefit from the Conto
Energia III regime (see Conto Energia III, CL-99, Articles 4 (1) and 8(1) and the Tribunal’s analysis at {¥] 440-449)
during the original time frame or in the subsequent 14-month “sunset” grace period, even if no changes would have
been made to it by the Respondent. To such respect he notes that at the time of the contested measures the Project
Finance was not yet in place, the plants were not under construction (notwithstanding the performance by Eskosol of
other relevant works as those related to the two substations and the medium voltage grid) and, prior to the Romani
Decree, Claimant had been unable to make the first payment to Siemens under the EPC contract (corresponding to the
initial deposit). In such circumstances, Claimant has not been able to discharge the onus of proof that Respondent’s
contested measures were the operative cause of the project’s failure (see in similar terms Blusun, RL-56, § 394) and
no further analysis of Respondent's actions is therefore required in the present case.

123

382.

a clear path to success until Italy dramatically changed the regulatory regime on which

Eskosol’s business plan was based.

In the Tribunal’s view, this debate is the proverbial “wrong end of the telescope”: it is not the
place to start in any resolution of this dispute. The issue of causation logically becomes
relevant only if a breach of duty is first shown. If a State has not violated its treaty obligations
with respect to a particular investor and investment, then it does not matter what consequences
the State’s non-wrongful action may have had for a particular business project. The Tribunal
therefore starts with Eskosol’s allegations of an ECT breach, with particular reference here to
its claim that by enacting the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, Italy violated its duty
under ECT Article 10(1) to “encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its
Area,” which “conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of

Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.”

As the Parties’ submissions recognize, the fair and equitable treatment standard has been
interpreted as involving several different elements, which may take on differing degrees of
importance in different disputes, depending on the facts and the nature of the wrongs alleged.
In this case, there has been no allegation that the Government’s measures in question were
targeted at a particular investor or investment, nor that they were intended to abuse or harass,
nor that they were discriminatory. Rather, it appears as common ground that both the Romani
Decree and Conto Energia IV were general enactments intended to apply to an entire industry
sector. That is an important starting point for the analysis, because it eliminates various factors

that can be critical in other cases to an evaluation of FET claims.

Nonetheless, the fact that the challenged measures were general industry-wide measures, not
targeted at any investor and not intended to abuse, harass or discriminate, does not end the
FET analysis. Eskosol contends that the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV nonetheless
violated Italy’s obligations under ECT Article 10(1) because they allegedly violated its
legitimate expectations; were inconsistent with Italy’s obligations to provide a stable and
consistent framework for investments; and were arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and

non-transparent.

124

383.

384.

385.

These various contentions could be analyzed in any sequence. However, in the circumstances
of this case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to start not with the specifics of Eskosol’s
investment (e.g., the question of its legitimate expectations), but rather at the macro-level,
with Eskosol’s arguments about Italy’s alleged arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate and
non-transparent acts. Only after grappling with those questions about the measures in general
does it make sense to proceed to the issues involving regulatory stability, consistency and
legitimate expectations, which examine whether — even if the Romani Decree and Conto
Energia IV in and of themselves were not problematic under the ECT — Eskosol nonetheless
might be entitled to protection against the changes they introduced to the previously
applicable tariff regime. In that context, the Tribunal examines both Eskosol’s general claim
about Italy’s duty to provide a stable and consistent framework for investments, and its claim
that it had legitimate expectations to be able to benefit from the Conto Energia III regime,
either because of assurances that it allegedly received from various Government sources, or

in consequence of the terms of Conto Energia III itself.

b. Alleged Arbitrary and Unreasonable Conduct

Applying this sequence of analysis, the Tribunal begins with Eskosol’s claim that the Romani

Decree and Conto Energy IV were arbitrary and unreasonable.

To give meaning to this standard, Eskosol invokes the ICJ’s definition in ELSI, according to
which “arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed
to the rule of law. ... It is a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at
least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.”°”* Eskosol also notes the Plama definition of
arbitrary or unreasonable measures as “those which are not founded in reason or fact but on
caprice, prejudice or personal preference.”*”? Italy does not quarrel with these definitions,**°
and the Tribunal considers them appropriate as well. It equally notes the helpful definition
offered in AES, which examines first “the existence of a rational policy,” which is one “taken
by a state following a logical (good sense) explanation and with the aim of addressing a public

interest matter,” and second whether the challenged act was itself reasonably related to the

58 Memorial, § 318 (quoting ELSI, CL-120, § 128).

386.

policy, in the sense of “an appropriate correlation between the state’s public policy objective
and the measure adopted to achieve it.”**! As otherwise stated by the E/ Paso tribunal, citing

99582 «4

both ELSI and ordinary dictionary definitions of the word “arbitrary, ‘there are always
several methods for dealing” with challenging circumstances in a country, but the issue of
arbitrariness examines not “whether the measures taken were or were not the best,” but simply
whether they were “based on a reasoned scheme” that was itself reasonably connected to “the

aim pursued.”>*?

In this regard, Eskosol’s first basis for claiming that the Romani Decree and Conto Energia
IV were arbitrary and unreasonable is that they allegedly were adopted on a pretext, as a favor
to the nuclear power industry rather than from a true concern about managing the
unexpectedly rapid growth of the country’s PV energy sector in response to generous
incentive policies.*** Legally, an allegation that a State acted on a pretext is close to alleging
that it acted in bad faith, because the concept is that the State used legal instruments for
purposes other than those for which they ostensibly were created. For obvious reasons, a party
seeking to demonstrate that a State acted for ulterior motives, and thus not on the basis of its
stated public policy rationale, bears the burden to so demonstrate. In this case, however,
Eskosol has presented little if any cognizable evidence to support its claim. Its witness Mr.
Magli alludes to “common knowledge amongst the Italian public that the change of heart in
respect of the solar PV industry was due to ‘political’ reasons and had nothing to do with an
excessive renewable energy capacity,” and its witness Mr. Scognamiglio refers to what “later
became known to the public” regarding “motivat[ion] by the pressure of the nuclear lobby.”**°
These general allusions to “common knowledge” and “public” knowledge hardly qualify as
evidence. The only other evidence Eskosol cites in support of an ostensible ulterior motive is

the statement of EU official Mr. Claude Turmes that the Romani Decree “is a huge and

581 4ES, CL-81/RL-82, {ff 10.3.7-10.3.9; see similarly Saluka, CL-56, § 460 (examining whether State conduct “bears

unacceptable gift made to the nuclear lobby.”**° It is not clear whether Mr. Turmes meant to
imply that this was the State’s motivation for the measure, or simply that the nuclear industry
stood to benefit from it, but in any event, Claimant presents no evidence to support Mr.

Turmes’ opinion or otherwise to prove pretextual conduct.

In any event, by the end of the Hearing, it was not clear that Eskosol even maintained its
allegation about ulterior motives to assist the nuclear energy industry. After making this
pretext allegation in its Memorial, Eskosol barely returned to the assertion in its Reply,
alleging only that Italy’s stated concern about too much incentivized energy entering the
market too soon was “in fact a cover-up for whatever its real motive may have been.”>*’
Eskosol did not reference the nuclear industry allegation at all in its Post-Hearing Brief, which
instead contended that “the key reason” for the early end of Conto Energia III “was to deal
with the unexpected consequence of the Salva Alcoa act, [which] created a huge and

unexpected amount of FiTs.”°**

Eskosol’s second basis for alleging that Italy acted arbitrarily, in the sense that “it failed to
pursue a legitimate objective,”**? is that Italy justified the new limitations on accessing Conto
Energia III incentives by referring to excessive (and excessively rapid) growth in the PV
sector — for example, predicting in January 2011 that the National Action Plan’s 2020 target
of 8,000 MW “might be reached towards the end of 2011” — while in reality, (i) these
predictions “were incorrect” (because as of February 2011, only 3,730 MW had been

590

connected to the grid),°’” and (ii) soon afterwards, Conto Energia IV raised the objective to

58 See Memorial, {| 330 (quoting C-83).

587 Reply, §| 146 (emphasis added). Eskosol did chide Italy in a footnote for not responding to the allegedly “abundant
evidence that favoritism of the nuclear industry influenced the sudden end of Conto Energia III,” but it cited no such
evidence, abundant or otherwise. Id., n. 291.

(stating that “[aJll the contemporary evidence” demonstrates that the new measures were “in response to the problems
associated with the Salva Alcoa Act”).

58° Memorial, 4 321.

5 Eskosol also cites certain April 2011 statistics as evidence that the GSE’s January 2011 predictions for the year
“were not accurate.” Reply, § 139 (citing C-111, which reported that as of 20 April 2011, total nominal capacity in
operation was 4,550 MW, with another 2,400 MW expected to enter in operation by the end of June 2011).

127

389.

390.

23,000 MW by 2016, an increase which “plainly belies the earlier erroneous statements” that

PV sector growth was too rapid and needed to be curbed.>”!

Taking these arguments in turn, the Tribunal notes (as to the former) that a putative error by
regulators or legislators in predicting how quickly additional PV plants might come online
during 2011 (i.e., whether the 8,000 MW target was likely to be reached that year) would not
itself render illegitimate a policy objective of controlling growth, or render irrational actions
taken in support of that policy goal. Just as good faith errors about existing facts do not amount
to arbitrary or irrational conduct, an inaccurate but good faith prediction of future events —
particularly one made in a highly dynamic environment — is hardly evidence of conduct
founded in caprice rather than in reason or honest belief. In this case, there is no basis to
believe that the GSE’s projections in January 2011, about the amount of total installed PV
capacity likely to have come into operation by the end of 2011, were made in anything other
than good faith. Moreover, the evidence suggests that the January 2011 predictions for the
end of 2011 were if anything on the low side, because as it turned out, Italy’s total installed
PV capacity was almost 13,000 MW by the end of 2011.°” The fact that a significant portion
of the rapid growth may have resulted from the Salva Alcoa Act, which provided a window
for plants coming into operation in early 2011 to still qualify for Conto Energia II FiTs (rather
than Conto Energia III), does not affect the arbitrariness analysis. Whatever the reason for the
trends, it was not arbitrary for Italy to acknowledge their existence, nor to consider them

relevant to its assessment of the need for (or timing of) further regulatory adjustments.

Eskosol’s second argument — that it was irrational for Italy to decry the rapid achievement of
the prior 8,000 MW target, and then shortly afterwards declare a substantially increased target
of 23,000 MW -— deserves greater attention. The difficulty here is that Eskosol oversimplifies
the policy objective that underlay all of Italy’s Conto Energy schemes, including the earlier
ones on which Eskosol claims to have relied. The evidence is clear that the policy goal was

not simply unidimensional, to achieve a particular volume of PV capacity by means of

financial incentives. Rather, the incentive program from the outset was more nuanced,
involving the interaction of at least three related policy objectives: (i) increasing PV capacity,
(ii) doing so by means of long-term subsidies over market pricing, which would ensure sector
investors an overall “fair return” (over the projected life of a given PV plant) on the costs
they incurred in building and operating that new PV plant, but with the expectation that such
costs gradually would decrease for new plants coming online, with the promotion of more
cost-effective technologies, and (iii) managing the burden of these tariff subsidies on
electricity consumers, since incentive payments to plant operators ultimately were to be

factored in to electricity prices by way of a surcharge embedded in user accounts.

That these three policy objectives were interrelated from the outset is clear on the face of the
prior enactments on which Eskosol claims it relies in formulating its own investment plan.
For example, starting with Italy’s Legislative Decree No. 387 of 29 December 2003, it was
expressly mandated that the incentivizing tariffs be offered “without any cost to the State

budget,”**

meaning that the costs would be passed on to electricity consumers.** It was
equally clear that tariff levels were to reflect cost expectations, with levels maintained for “a
duration that ensures a fair return on the investment and operating costs” for plants coming
into operation at a given time, but over time, with the tariffs offered to subsequent plants being

of a “decreasing nature,”*”°

presumably to reflect expected declines in solar panel costs and
also the State’s diminishing need to provide subsidies over market pricing to support sector

growth.

The first two Conto Energia schemes likewise confirmed the interaction of these several
policy objectives. First, Conto Energia I provided that the tariffs recognized by the decree
would apply only up to a “[mJaximum aggregate limit” of power (originally 100 MW, later

amended to 500 MW),°°° and made clear that this cap on anticipated subsidy obligations had

593 Legislative Decree No. 387, CL-94, Art. 7(1) (emphasis added).

54 Eskosol’s witnesses clearly understood that the costs of the subsidy program were to be borne by consumers. See
Scognamiglio I, 9 (“The costs of the incentivising tariffs were to be paid by end consumers, as part of their electricity
bill”). The expert witnesses explain that this was implemented by guaranteeing preferential prices exceeding market
prices, with the guests of the premium distributed to end users as an “A3” surcharge on their bills/ Delfanti/Motta I,

been calculated in the context of a particular national target of installed PV capacity by 2015
(originally 300 MW, later amended to 1,000 MW).°”” While any given power plant qualifying
for incentives by entering into operation®** was assured that its particular tariff level would
be fixed for 20 years, new plants entering into operation in later years would have their 20-
year fixed tariffs set at lower levels, based on the particular year in which they entered into
operation.*”” In this way, the scheme anticipated a gradual reduction over time in the burden
passed on to Italian consumers, since the total amount of power entitled to any subsidy was

capped, and the level of that subsidy would decrease over time.

Conto Energia II likewise reflected the same basic interlocking policy objectives. It again (i)
sought to increase PV capacity based on a national target for cumulative installed PV power
(now set at 3,000 MW by 2016),°° (ii) by offering incentive pricing, which was still at
guaranteed fixed levels for 20 years based on the date of each plant’s entry into operation,“
while (iii) making clear that FiT levels would decrease over time for each later year in which
new plants entered into operation,” and (iv) that there was an anticipated limit on the volume
of power that could benefit from the scheme (now set at 1,200 MW).° One departure from
Conto Energia I is that the ceiling on incentivized power was now to be implemented with
some flexibility in the form of a 14-month grace period triggered when the 1,200 MW figure
was reached, presumably so as not to abruptly disqualify plants that were close to entering
into operation at that time, with a tracking mechanism introduced to facilitate awareness of

progress towards achieving both the national target and the incentive ceiling of 1,200 MW.°>

Finally, and again consistent with the interlocking policy objectives on which Italy’s incentive
scheme had been based from the outset, Conto Energia II contained a very clear reminder that

FiT levels in future would be based on the regulator’s understanding both of (i) evolutions in

PV plant cost structure (to implement the goal of a fair but not excessive return), and (ii) the
cumulative burden on electricity consumers from the volume of incentives already granted.
These two elements were reflected in Conto Energia II’s statement that FiT levels applicable
to future periods would be re-evaluated taking into account both “the price trends of energy
products and components for photovoltaic plants” and the results of prior incentive programs,
including the amount of PV energy brought online and the volume of incentives thus far

extended.

The National Renewable Action Plan of June 2010 further confirmed that Italy’s policy
scheme for PV power growth included, as key parts of its intertwined objectives,
“rationalizing the current incentives based on trends in the cost of the various technologies,”
to avoid the scenario of excessive returns (i.e., beyond what was needed to fairly recompense
investment) at the expense of electricity consumers. These two elements were reflected in the
Plan’s report that there would be “regular reviews” of the FiT for solar energy, “in order to
take into account the expected reduction in component and plant costs and to expand the
production base whilst /imiting and regulating the economic impact on the electricity
sector.” The National Renewable Action Plan also referred to the need for “corrections ...
to the existing framework ... in order to avoid a parallel increase in production and in

77608 which would include a review of FiT levels “in order to avoid excessive

incentive costs,
or insufficient remuneration.” It described Italy’s program as a “support scheme” which
guarantees plants “constant remuneration” for the power they produce, but “subject to regular
adjustments which take into account the érends in the prices of energy products and
components for photovoltaic plants ... with the intention of limiting the medium- and long-

term costs to the community.”°"

Finally, the same multi-faceted policy objectives were reflected in Conto Energia III, which

entered into effect in August 2010, soon after the National Renewable Action Plan. The

recitals expressly referenced the reduction in costs of PV technology and the importance of
progressively reducing tariff levels in light of the basic tariff principle of “fair remuneration
of costs.”°'! Just as with prior iterations, Conto Energia III referred to an updated national
target for cumulative installed PV power (now 8,000 MW by 2020);°!? offered incentive
pricing based on the date of each plant’s entry into operation, at decreasing levels for later
plants but with any given plant still guaranteed its particular FiT for 20 years;°'> and
referenced an anticipated limit on the volume of power that could benefit from the scheme
(now set at 3,000 MW),°'* while continuing Conto Energia II’s approach of a 14-month grace
period after the ceiling was met, during which new plants entering into operation still would

be entitled to receive FiTs at Conto Energia III levels.°!°

With Italy’s policy objectives understood in this more nuanced context, it was hardly irrational
for Italy’s officials to worry in early 2011, when it became increasingly clear that past
incentive payment levels had encouraged greater and faster PV plant investment than had
been anticipated, at the same time as the market cost of solar panels had dramatically
decreased. The point was not that Italy necessarily wanted to cap national PV power overall
at 8,000 MW (which arguably would have been inconsistent with its announcing soon
afterwards a new national target of 23,000 MW). Rather, the concern was about the potential
consequences of continuing such rapid growth without first adjusting the regulatory scheme,
to take into account the two other elements (fair but not excessive returns, and minimizing the
burden on consumers) that always had been closely connected to PV capacity in the design of

the policy scheme.

Italy’s policymakers apparently understood that as a matter of logic, a continued explosion of
new capacity qualifying for high FiT levels would have at least two consequences. First,
newer plants that were constructed at substantially lower component costs than originally

anticipated — but which would still receive a 20-year stream of FiTs that had been calculated

on assumptions about higher component costs — would thereby obtain higher rates of return
than the “fair return” which the subsidy scheme had been designed to ensure. It is undisputed
that the cost of PV plant equipment decreased substantially in the relevant time period, due to

©16 and Eskosol’s own witness confirmed that

technological advances and economies of scale,
the cost of such equipment (i.e., solar panels and associated materials) “was one of the most
expensive parts” of such a PV plant project.°!” The effect was that overall project costs
substantially decreased as well. Italy’s experts reported that the price of PV plants in Italy fell
by 40-50% between 2007 and 2010.°!® Set against an incentive scheme that guaranteed tariff
rates at fixed levels over a 20-year period, such dramatically lower costs necessarily would
mean dramatically higher rates of return. It was hardly irrational for Italy to take this into

account in calibrating a program that, from the start, always had been based on a principle of

regulated (not market-based) “fair returns.”

Second, the financial burden of providing these higher-than-anticipated returns to a larger-
than-anticipated volume of PV plant beneficiaries would be borne by Italian consumers,
resulting in a greater burden on consumer electricity prices than originally had been expected.
Indeed, the “A3” surcharge on general system charges, which was added to end user bills to
finance incentives for renewable energy, had become the largest component of the system
charges, with its most rapid growth in 2010-2011 due to the enormous increase in installed
PV power.°!” Projections in late 2010 were that Conto Energia costs for end-users could
increase five or six-fold in 2011 over their 2010 levels, which understandably called into

question the sustainability of the mechanism.”° It was not an irrational decision for Italy’s

616 See Bacchiocchi, §{ 11, 19; see also DBW-8, p. 10 (Minister Romani noting that the cost of equipment had
decreased by almost 50% over one year, and “the incentive is intended to be tied to the cost of the equipment
installed”).

stage of plant construction.

policymakers to take this “overall societal cost” into account, as “a driver for updating” the

tariff schedules earlier than originally had been contemplated.°?!

Putting these two factors together, Italy’s decision to adjust the core elements of its incentive
scheme — to recalibrate provisions regulating how many new plants could qualify, in what
time periods, for subsidized tariffs at what levels — cannot be said to violate the core notion
of rationality as defined in the AES case, namely as lacking a “logical (good sense)

explanation” aimed at “addressing a public interest matter.”

To the contrary, a policy choice
to rebalance the program could be seen as entirely consonant with its original objectives,
which were to encourage industry growth by ensuring builders of new PV plants a fair (but
not excessive) return over costs, while managing the financial burden on electricity consumers
— and trying to control the pace of subsidized growth — by providing limits to the number of

plants that could qualify for preferential tariffs in particular time periods.

Nor were the measures actually taken by Italy logically unrelated to such a public interest
goal, in the AES sense of lacking “an appropriate correlation between the state’s public policy
objective and the measure adopted to achieve it.”°** To the contrary, both the Romani Decree
and Conto Energia IV were expressly aimed at the stated objectives. The Romani Decree
noted that one of the general criteria for encouraging renewable energy production had always

been “ensuring a fair return on investment and operating costs,”®>

and explained that the
forthcoming Conto Energia IV would set new FiT levels “taking into account the reduction
in the costs of the technology and power plants.”°*° Conto Energia IV likewise emphasized
“the evolution of technology costs” as a key reason for implementing a “gradual reduction of
the tariffs” for new PV plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011, and explained that

this reduction would “tend to align the public aid with the relevant cost of the technology.”°”

At the same time, Conto Energia IV continued to provide that any particular tariff level for
which a given plant qualified, based on the date of its entry into operation, would remain
constant for that plant for 20 years.°* And while the new scheme discontinued the grace
period that Conto Energia III had provided, to enable plants in the development pipeline to
benefit from its FiT levels so long as they came into operation within a defined period after
the otherwise applicable incentive ceiling was reached, Conto Energia IV provided its own
form of flexibility (albeit less generous) for qualifying for incentives. Under the new scheme,
plants that were close enough to completion to be commissioned by 31 May 2011 could still
benefit from the Conto Energia III incentives, and those which were able to be commissioned
by 31 August 2011 could qualify for Conto Energia IV incentives through a “direct access”
provision. As for others that were further back in development, they could sign up in advance
for participation under Conto Energia IV, through a new registration process that enabled
operators to enter the pipeline for incentives even before plant construction was completed.
While construction still would have to be completed within a specified period after

630

registration,°°’ the period apparently was long enough to enable a considerable number of

power plants to qualify.°*!

In any event, while the new regulatory arrangement no doubt was more challenging than the
past ones for would-be new PV plant operators, there was nothing in its terms that reflected
irrationality, in the sense of unreasoned conduct that was not correlated to stated public
interest goals. For these reasons, and putting aside for later analysis whether the change in
regulatory regime violated any separate ECT obligations of legal stability owed to Eskosol,
the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Romani Decree or Conto Energia IV violated the
prohibition on arbitrary and unreasonable conduct which is embedded in ECT Article 10(1)’s
provision for fair and equitable treatment. This conclusion applies with respect to two of the
challenged features of the State measures, namely (i) their lowering of FiT levels for new PV

plants sooner than had been anticipated under Conto Energia III, and (ii) their cutback on the

grace period during which future new plants coming online could still access prior (higher)

FiT levels.

This leaves only one further argument by Eskosol about alleged arbitrariness, which relates
to the Romani Decree’s separate regulation of the use of agricultural land for future PV plants
—or more precisely, its limitation on which such uses of agricultural land would be entitled to
qualify for incentive tariffs. Eskosol contends that it was arbitrary and unreasonable for the
Romani Decree to limit access to future incentive tariffs, for new PV plants built on
agricultural land, to those which occupied 10% or less of the relevant land parcels, while
providing only a one-year grace period for plants occupying more of their respective parcels
to still qualify by completing construction and connecting to the electrical grid. In Eskosol’s
view, this feature of the Romani Decree “lacked any reasonable justification” and was “simply
another manifestation of the Italian Government’s undue attempt at thwarting Italy’s solar PV

industry.”°>?

The Tribunal does not agree. Reasonable minds can differ in any country about how to balance
land use for agriculture versus land use for renewable energy production, and also about
whether the appropriate balance is better fostered by favoring (i) a presumably smaller number
of large energy production plants that occupy a sizeable proportion of their land plots, or (ii)
a presumably larger number of small energy production plants that occupy a modest
proportion of their land plots. Where to draw the line necessarily is a land use policy decision.
In this case, there was nothing inherently irrational (in the sense of not founded on reason)

about the particular choice Italy made.

Indeed, Conto Energia II already had expressed concern that “the first results [of Conto
Energia I] have shown ... an excessive imbalance in favour of the construction of large

plants,”633

which Italy’s experts explain included a substantial practice (including in the
Puglia region) of developers disguising large projects as smaller ones by clustering many

small plants together in adjacent plots.°* The preamble to Conto Energia II therefore

64 Delfanti/Motta I, p. 58.

136

expressed a goal to “guide the diffusion process of PV technology towards applications ...
that allow lower usage of the territory.”°* Despite this policy preference, however, expansion
of the sector during 2010 “show[ed] a clear development of the sector toward large scale
plants, contrary to the spirit of Conto Energia II.”°° In this context, the Romani Decree’s
effort to refocus future incentives on smaller PV plants, including those which left more room
on their land plots for agricultural use, was arguably consistent with the earlier stated policy

goals, even though it was implemented in a different way.’

406. In addition, the decision to defer the effective date of the policy change, by granting a grace

period of a full year during which PV plants currently in development based on prior land use

8 was also

parameters (no more than 50% of the land) still could qualify for incentives,
rational. Eskosol’s witness Mr. Magli acknowledged that “[t]he actual construction of a PV
farm is rather straightforward,” and “a year to build the plants would not normally be
problematic.”°*? Indeed, that timetable was generally consistent with the construction
schedule Siemens had anticipated in the EPC Contract.™° In consequence, the grace period
the Romani Decree provided before the new land use restrictions entered into effect would

seem to have been tailored to allow completion of most PV plant projects that already were

in the construction phase, or otherwise were in a position promptly to commence construction.

407. The Tribunal has no doubt that for some entrepreneurial projects that had not yet begun any

plant construction, but were still at an earlier stage of development (like Eskosol’s), the
decision to select a one-year grace period rather than some longer period might prove

fateful.! But the fact remains that in introducing any new policy program, a temporal line

towards applications that minimize the environmental impact and maximize the degree of diffusion (i.e. building
integrated plants rather than large scale ground installations in agricultural areas)”).

4! Mr. Magli admits that the impediment in Eskosol’s case was not that the one-year grace period was insufficient for
construction, but rather that Eskosol was not yet ready to commence construction, because its project financing was
still in development and became more complicated by the new regulatory regime. See Magli II, 4 35.

(or effective date) must be drawn somewhere, and Italy’s decision in this case to draw it at a
one-year juncture — rather than at a hypothetically longer juncture — did not render the measure
inherently arbitrary. Certainly, rationality does not require that a State phase in its new
regulatory programs in such a way that every single entrepreneur, at every single stage of the
development pipeline, still might be entitled to complete its project plans without adverse
impact from the new regime. As the tribunal in E/ Paso remarked, the issue for arbitrariness
is not “whether the measures taken were or were not the best,” but simply whether they were
“based on a reasoned scheme” that was itself reasonably connected to “the aim pursued.”*?

The Tribunal considers that standard to have been met in this case.

ec. Alleged Disproportionate and Non-Transparent Conduct

In addition to charging that the changes introduced by the Romani Decree and Conto Energia
IV were arbitrary and unreasonable, Eskosol argues that they were disproportionate and the
result of non-transparent conduct, in violation of the fair and equitable treatment obligation

in ECT Article 10(1).

With respect to proportionality, Eskosol contends that this requires State measures to be
“reasonably related and appropriately narrow to address a legitimate State interest,” citing
Tecmed also for the proposition that “[t]here must be a reasonable relationship of
proportionality between the charge or weight imposed to the foreign investor and the aim
sought to be realized” by the measure in question. Italy in turn references proportionality

in the context of quoting the B/usun award, which stated as follows:

In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies such
as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully
granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which
is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard
to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial
resources on the basis of the earlier regime.

The Tribunal accepts in principle that part of assessing compliance with the fair and equitable
treatment standard is determining whether State measures were disproportionate, in the sense
of imposing burdens on foreign investment that went far beyond what was reasonably
necessary to achieve good faith public interest goals. In this case, however, the Tribunal does
not agree with Eskosol that Italy violated its ECT obligations “because [it] failed to engage
... ‘in a rational decision-making process’ by considering ‘the effect of a measure on foreign
investments and a balance of the interests of the State with any burden imposed on such
investments.’”*° To the contrary, while Italy did introduce changes to its incentive scheme
through the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, three elements of the regulatory changes
reflect that consideration was given to, and reasonable provision was made for, the interests

of PV plant investors in Italy.

First, the State measures left completely intact the incentive tariff regime applicable to PV
plants that already had qualified for incentives under prior Conto Energia regimes, by entering
into operation while those regimes remained in effect. The measures provided that such
operating plants would continue to enjoy the exact same tariff levels that had been provided
under previous regimes, for the exact same periods of time (20 years from entry into
operation). Consequently, this case does not present the question at issue in certain other
investment treaty cases, where tariff levels were lowered for plants already in operation. Italy

did not make any such changes.

Second, the challenged measures each included transitional mechanisms intended to provide
an opportunity for investors who were reasonably far along in the process of developing
additional PV plants to qualify for incentive tariffs. Putting aside for separate analysis the
issue of Eskosol’s alleged legitimate expectation to be protected against any early phase-out
of Conto Energia III (which will be discussed infra), the relevant changes introduced through
the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV did not completely remove the possibility for PV
plant projects still in development to qualify for participation in the State’s preferential tariff
program. To the contrary, the Romani Decree provided that plants entering into operation

during the next three months (by the end of May 2011) — for which investors presumably

46 Memorial, { 328 (quoting LG&E, CL-109, §| 158).

139

413.

already would have purchased and largely installed the relevant plant equipment — would still
qualify for the tariffs provided under Conto Energia III.“’ Conto Energia IV in turn provided
that plants entering into operation by March 2012 would qualify for incentives, with those
doing so earlier entitled to higher tariff levels than those doing so later.“* Those entering into
operation by the end of August 2011 could qualify directly, without needing to pre-register,”
while those unable to meet this deadline — but still projecting eventual completion by March
2012 — could register for incentives even while construction was ongoing.* Finally, with
respect to the Romani Decree’s institution of tighter limits on the diffusion of PV plants across
agricultural land, the Decree provided that its new rules (limiting incentives to plants
occupying no more than 10% of the parcel available) would not come into effect for a full
year from its entry into force.*! It is undisputed that many entrepreneurs were able to benefit

from these various transitional mechanisms.

The Tribunal accepts, of course, that not all investors developing PV plant projects would be
able to bring their projects to completion in time to qualify for these transitional mechanisms.
Thus, while the new measures protected both (i) those whose plants already had entered into
operation, and (ii) those whose projects were reasonably nearing completion (effectively,
within a year after the Romani Decree), there was (iii) a third group of investors — whose
projects could not be completed within one year — who would be impacted more significantly

by the regulatory changes.°?

Nonetheless, the concept of disproportionality, as applied to
general sector-wide measures taken in the public interest, with no targeting of a particular
investor, does not require States to make provision for all pending projects at any point in the
development pipeline. Stated otherwise, a State does not violate its general treaty obligation
of proportionality simply because, when it provides a grace period before new regulations
apply, not all investors will be able to meet the requirements of that grace period. The

proportionality of a measure of general applicability must be evaluated in light of its overall

features and impacts, and not through the narrow lens of its impact on a particular investor.
In this case, the fact that Italy did provide grace period and transitional mechanisms, rather
than abruptly changing its regulatory regime with no opportunity for appropriately situated
investors to adapt, was itself an indicator that Italy took into account — and sought to alleviate

to a reasonable degree — the potential impact of regulatory change on investors.

Finally, the incentives offered to investors who managed to complete their PV plants within
the applicable time periods were not disproportionately reduced, when considered in the
context of similar reductions that Italy had periodically introduced through prior Conto
Energias, and particularly in the context of the rationale for the additional reductions. In this
context, it bears repeating that the incentive program from the beginning had expressly
predicated tariff levels on the notion of a “fair return” over PV project costs, and made clear
that tariff levels periodically would be adjusted downwards as project costs themselves

decreased.

While the adjustment was introduced in this instance earlier than originally
anticipated, this was partly a consequence of a dramatic drop in PV project costs, and notably,
the reduction in FiT subsidies was proportionately less than the corresponding drop in
technology costs during 2010.°** There has been no suggestion in this case that the tariff

decreases were of a magnitude to violate the notion of a “fair return” over project costs.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to find a breach of ECT Article 10(1) on the

basis of allegedly disproportionate conduct.

With respect to Eskosol’s claims alleging non-transparent conduct, Eskosol relies on the
Metatlclad decision for the proposition that investors should be able to know clearly in advance
“all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully
operating investments made, or intended to be made ... [with] no room for doubt or

uncertainty.” Eskosol relies on Tecmed for a similar proposition, that States should act

Indeed, the preamble to Conto Energia III had itself referenced a decision “to intervene in order to adjourn the

incentivizing tariffs in light of the light of the positive reduction of the costs of the photovoltaic technology, and in
order to respect the principle of fair remuneration of costs” that had been established by Legislative Decree No. 387
of 2003. CL-99, p. 2.

“totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand
any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments ... to be able to plan its
investment and comply with such regulations.” These are sweeping propositions,°*” and
the Tribunal is unable to accept them in such broad terms, which would provide no room for
good faith regulatory flexibility or recalibration even where a State strives to be forthcoming
about its reasons for change, both through public dialogue and through clarity in its laws. The
Tribunal instead sees the issue of transparency along the same lines as the Electrabel tribunal,
which found an obligation under the ECT “to be forthcoming with information about intended
changes in policy and regulations that may significantly affect investments, so that the
investor can adequately plan its investment and, if needed, engage the host State in dialogue

about protecting its legitimate expectations.”°*

With this understanding in mind, the Tribunal turns to Eskosol’s particular complaints about
transparency, which can be perceived as falling into two categories: one about the premature
end of Conto Energia III, and the other about the specific incentive tariffs that would apply

afterwards, under Conto Energia IV.

With respect to the former, Eskosol complains that it “had no way to foresee” that Italy would
end the Conto Energia III regime early, since that ran counter to Italy’s previous statements
regarding the stability of the applicable legal framework. The Tribunal sees this complaint
as closely connected to Eskosol’s legitimate expectations argument, which it addresses in the
next section. In essence, if an investor has a treaty right to be protected against a particular
regulatory change, then the transparency analysis adds little to the analysis, addressing
perhaps only how much advance notice the investor might have been provided about the
changes that would violate its rights. By contrast, if an investor has no treaty right to be
protected against a particular regulatory change, then the transparency analysis cannot be

specific to its circumstances (including how much advance notice of the change might have

been helpful for its business plans). Rather, the issue must be addressed at the more general
level, including whether the State acted secretively to conceal its plans or announced those

plans openly and with reasonable explanation and detail.

In this case, the Tribunal finds that there was no such secrecy, but rather ample public debate
before the Romani Decree was issued about the possible need to change the incentives
scheme. While the Romani Decree was not issued in final form until 3 March 2011, the key
factors that ultimately led to the Decree were all discussed openly by policymakers for several
prior months, including the veritable explosion of new plants coming online, the fact that such
plants were benefitting from an environment of dramatically reduced technology costs, and
the reality that allowing these developments to continue unchecked would pose a severe
burden on electricity consumers to finance incentive rates that would not be needed to ensure
a fair return.° Given this prior public debate, the Tribunal sees no transparency violation
resulting from Italy’s decision to end Conto Energia III early, particularly since that decision
was promptly announced and also (by its terms) provided three months’ advance notice before
the termination of Conto Energia III would come into effect. The announcement in early
March 2011 of a change that would become operative at the end of May 2011 was consistent
with the obligation, recognized in Electrabel, for States to be “forthcoming with information

about intended changes in policy and regulations” that might affect investments.”°!

Eskosol’s second argument is that there was a gap in time between the Romani Decree’s
announcement that Conto Energia III would end early, and the enactment of Conto Energia
IV setting out the details of the next regime, which allegedly “left Eskosol in legal limbo,

without any ability to understand what, if any, incentives Eskosol would be able to secure

60 See, e.g., GSE document entitled “Hearing of 25/1/2011 — Comments of GSE on the Scheme of Law Decree
Implementing Directive 2009/28/CE,” 25 January 2011, C-82 (Senate hearing on 25 January 2011, during which the
GSE noted that “the growth of photovoltaic power plants has been too rapid,” with the likelihood that the National
Action Plan’s 2020 target of 8,000 MW instead would be reached “nine years in arrears,” by the end of 2011; noted
that “[o]nce into operation, the above mentioned plants will accrue burdens [to consumers] over the A3 fee equal to 3
billion euro, each year for 20 years”; and proposed “a reduction on the capacity to be incentivized ... as well as a
reduction to incentivising tariffs for power plants which will come into operation ... [for the] years 2012 and 2013”);

Energia III incentives, to be replaced by a new Conto Energia IV setting out “the relevant modalities”).

under the forthcoming Conto Energia IV.”° This created a “state of uncertainty” which

Eskosol says “amounts to a failure to act transparently,” in violation of the ECT.

As noted above, the Romani Decree was clear that only plants entering into operation by 31
May 2011 would be able to benefit from its incentive rates. It also made clear that the
incentives applicable to plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011 would be governed
by a new decree to be issued soon, but in the meantime gave notice of at least two core
principles that would be reflected in the new decree, namely that there would be a “maximum
annual cumulative electric power from photovoltaic plants that can get the incentive rates,”
and that the particular tariffs would take into account “the reduction in the costs of the
technology and power plants” and the reduction in “the incentives applied by other Members
States of the European Union.” The Romani Decree anticipated that the new decree would
be “adopted ... by 30 April 2011.”° As it transpired, a draft of Conto Energia IV was
circulated on 19 April 2011,°°° the decree itself was issued on 5 May 2011, and it entered into

force on 12 May 2011.°°°

In other words, the gap between the Romani Decree’s announcement that incentive tariffs
would be reduced for new plants entering into operation after 31 May 2011, and Conto

Energia IV’s final identification of precisely what the new rates would be,°”

was essentially
two months, even if one does not account for the earlier release of a draft of the new decree.
The Tribunal has no doubt that during those two months, investors in the process of
developing new plants experienced a state of uncertainty. Nonetheless, the fact that Italy took
two months to roll out the details of the new regulation, after having previously announced
its general principles, is far from sufficient to amount to a violation of any ECT requirements

of transparency.

d. Alleged Violation of Legitimate Expectations Regarding
Stability and Consistency
For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal does not consider that the particular changes Italy
introduced to its incentive tariff scheme in 2011 constituted, in and of themselves, either
arbitrary and unreasonable conduct, disproportionate conduct or non-transparent conduct, in
violation of its fair and equitable treatment obligations in Article 10(1) of the ECT. However,
this leaves still to be examined the separate question of whether, simply by ending Conto
Energia III early and replacing it with a less beneficial scheme, Italy violated Eskosol’s
alleged legitimate expectations regarding stability and consistency of the legal regime.
Specifically, Eskosol argues that it had a legitimate expectation that Conto Energia III would
remain in effect for as long as its terms provide, and accordingly that Eskosol would have
additional time to complete its planned project and try to qualify for the Conto Energia III

tariff regime.

Eskosol alleges several different bases for such legitimate expectations, which the Tribunal
examines in the following sequence: (i) that representations and assurances were made
directly to it, by Undersecretary Saglia and by the GSE; (ii) that public statements by Italian
officials constituted representations and assurances to the investor community more
generally; and (iii) that in any event, the specific terms of Conto Energia III gave rise to
legitimate expectations, by referring expressly to the conditions for its termination (3,000 MW
of incentives) and providing for an additional 14-month grace period thereafter for new plants
to obtain Conto Energia III incentives. Separately, with respect to the issue of use of
agricultural land for PV plant development, Eskosol claims (iv) a general legitimate
expectation that prior land use regulations would not be changed on a timetable that would
render its land development plans (and related investments) inoperative. The Tribunal

addresses these issues below.

i. Statements directly to Eskosol

With respect to the first issue — alleged representations and assurances made directly by State
officials to Eskosol — the issue for determination is not really one of law, but rather one of
fact. It is well established that when a “specific commitment” has been made to a particular

investor regarding the legal framework applicable to its investment, changes in that

145

426.

framework can give rise to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, provided
the investor has relied on that commitment to make investments protected by the treaty. As
the E/ Paso tribunal explained, “the FET standard can be breached if there is a violation of a
specific commitment,” in the sense of a commitment “directly made to the investor,” for
example in a letter of intent or “through a specific promise in a person-to-person business

meeting.”°*

In this case, Eskosol points to several alleged instances during which “the Italian Government
made specific representations to Eskosol about the availability and guaranteed access to the
incentivizing tariff scheme.” First, Eskosol alleges that Undersecretary Saglia gave certain
oral assurances to Mr. Scognamiglio during several meetings in 2010.5? Eskosol’s sole
evidence for this assertion is Mr. Scognamiglio’s witness statement, which states very
generally that during one meeting, Undersecretary Saglia “made it very clear to me that Italy
was committed to keeping a stable environment for the investment in the solar PV sector and
that it would not follow Spain’s example.” No date is provided for this meeting, other than
that one of Mr. Scognamiglio’s meetings with Undersecretary Saglia was during May of
2010.°7! No further information is provided regarding the subject of the meeting, the length
or specificity of the discussion, or the context of this particular (very general) statement about
a “stable environment.” Eskosol presents no contemporaneous written records to document
the assurances allegedly provided. Mr. Scognamiglio then refers to a second meeting with
Undersecretary Saglia in mid-November 2010, shortly after Spain made significant cuts to the
FiTs it offered to PV energy producers, during which “[w]e received a shake of hands from
Undersecretary Saglia, and he said ‘Eskosol’s investment is welcome in Italy.”’°”? Again, no
contemporaneous written evidence is provided to document either of the fact of the meeting,
the fact of the statement by Undersecretary Saglia, or the specific context in which the (very
general) oral statement was provided. In other words, the only evidence presented to the

Tribunal to support Eskosol’s claim that these meetings conveyed “specific representations

73 consists

... about the availability and guaranteed access to the incentivizing tariff scheme’
of uncorroborated assertions by a single witness, of oral discussions with a single Government
official, which on Eskosol’s own case remained at an extremely high level of generality and
which it never troubled at the time to document as particularly important to its decision to

invest.

Eskosol’s only other evidence of supposed specific representations directed to it individually
is a letter from the GSE dated 3 December 2010, in which the GSE stated that “if the power
plants” Eskosol planned to construct “meet all the requirements, also technical as set forth by
applicable law, ... we believe that it is possible to secure access to the incentives set forth in
the so-called Conto Energia, pursuant to the applicable provisions of law.”°”* Eskosol
characterizes this letter as an assurance that Eskosol would be able to secure access to the
Conto Energia III tariffs,°”> but in the Tribunal’s view, the GSE’s letter does not say what
Eskosol reads it as saying. Rather, the letter can be seen as a fairly cautious statement that
made no commitments, but rather simply opined that the GSE expected the laws in force
would be applicable to those who met their requirements.°”® The GSE letter cannot be seen as
a representation (much less a guarantee) that the applicable laws would not change, nor would
it be reasonable for Eskosol to expect a regulatory body like the GSE even to be in a position
to offer such a guarantee, when the applicable regime was based on ministerial decrees and

not on regulatory discretion.

It is equally notable what Eskosol does not claim any Italian official ever said to it. There is
no suggestion that any official ever pledged that Eskosol would receive any particular
incentive tariffs for its plants.°’’ Given that Eskosol had not even begun building any of these
plants — indeed, at the time of these alleged conversations and the GSE letter, it had not even

signed the EPC Contract arranging for construction to start — it is hard to imagine how any

Italy characterizes the GSE letter this way: “The amount of caveats in this short declaration is almost comical:

obviously, for those subjects meeting the legal requirement and observing the law, then GSE believed securing the

benefits was ‘possible.

429.

430.

State official would have been in the position to make any such guarantees. Nor does Eskosol
allege that any State official ever assured it that Italian laws would not change, at any time
before Eskosol managed to complete its financing and construction work and reach a position
of actually being able to enter into operation. Italy for its part denies that its officials ever

“made any unilateral promise to Claimant that its laws would not change.”°”

ii. Public statements by Italian officials

As an alternative or additional source of its alleged legitimate expectations, Eskosol refers to

certain public statements by Italian officials during 2010.

Specifically, Eskosol quotes statements about the forthcoming Conto Energia III that
Undersecretary Saglia made at the Verona PV Summit in early May 2010, to what Eskosol
characterizes as a “targeted audience” of investors.°”? The statements in question were that (i)
“[i]t is the government’s intention to enact ... [a] new [Conto Energia] in order to give
certainty to the entire sector,” (ii) Conto Energia III would include “the ability to take
advantage of the tariffs for further 14 months after the target [of 3,000 MW] is achieved”; and
(iii) Italy’s goal with the forthcoming decree was to “simplify, but also give[] certainty of
rules."°° Eskosol characterizes these statements as providing “express and specific
guarantees” about an unalterable “right to a 14-month minimum guarantee period for

investors to secure the right to the incentivising tariff,”*!

giving rise to a legitimate
expectation that Eskosol “would have at the very least until May 2012 to build and connect”

its future PV plants and secure the Conto Energia III tariffs.°*?

These expectations were
further reinforced, Eskosol says, by the National Action Plan’s reference to the 14-month
grace period expected to feature in Conto Energia III.°*? Eskosol refers to Conto Energia III

as then “[fJulfilling Italy’s promises (at least temporarily).””°**+

By contrast, Italy refers to the Government statements prior to enactment of Conto Energia
III as simply reciting (accurately) what the contents of Conto Energia III were expected to
include. In its view, nothing in these statements constituted a “guarantee that the Conto

Energia III decree would remain unchanged until mid-2012.”6*

As to this debate, the Tribunal begins by accepting, at the level of principle, that it is possible
for State officials to generate legitimate expectations by clear commitments given to a defined
category of recipients, and not just by those directed singly to one investor at a time. This was
recognized by the E/ Paso tribunal, which distinguished between two types of specific
commitments: “those specific as to their addressee and those specific regarding their object

and purpose.”°*° With respect to the latter, the tribunal reasoned as follows:

Second, a commitment can be considered specific if its precise object was to give a
real guarantee of stability to the investor. Usually general texts cannot contain such
commitments, as there is no guarantee that they will not be modified in due course.
However, a reiteration of the same type of commitment in different types of general
statements could, considering the circumstances, amount to a specific behaviour of
the State, the object and purpose of which is to give the investor a guarantee on which
it can justifiably rely.”

At the same time, however, the Tribunal believes it is important to distinguish in the analysis,
as prior tribunals have done, between (i) statements made specifically to guarantee investors
that they would not be subject to “overly drastic changes,” and (ii) those which are primarily
“[pJolitical statements” or “general legislative statements,” which at best engender reduced

expectations, °**

since investors generally must assume that both politics and good faith
legislation in the public interest might have to evolve to meet new challenges and unforeseen
developments. While investors naturally may take into account the latter categories of

statements in assessing the risks and benefits of potential investments, “it is one thing to be

434,

435.

induced by political proposals to make an economic decision, and another thing to be able to

rely on these proposals to claim legal guarantees.”

With this distinction in mind, the Tribunal reverts to the particular statements made at the
Verona Summit. These were largely statements of intention regarding the Government’s plan
for Conto Energia III, including the terms that it was expected to include. (The National
Action Plan’s reference to the expected terms of Conto Energia were of a similar nature.) An
announcement of the particular terms that a future decree is expected to include cannot be
taken as a specific commitment that once enacted, those terms never could be modified, even
to react in rational, proportionate ways to unexpected challenges. For such a commitment to
be found, there would need to be additional statements made about the immutability of the

legal regime, and not just its expected contents.

That said, the Verona Summit statements did include, in addition to the description of the
Conto Energia III’s expected contents, several references to the State’s objective of providing
“certainty” to potential investors. An argument could be made that these references implied,
if not expressly promised, that the Conto Energia III regime would be a source of
predictability for investors, and accordingly would not be altered by the State (or at least not
cavalierly, or based on circumstances that potentially could be foreseen). However, even if
that proposition were to be accepted arguendo, there remains the key question of which
investors were being promised the referenced “certainty,” and at what stage in their
entrepreneurial development any such certainty about applicable rules could be expected to
attach. The Tribunal is unable to accept these general statements as a specific commitment to
the entire universe of potential PV plant investors, that no matter what steps they might or
might not take to implement a specific PV plant project, they would enjoy an equal guarantee
of “certainty” regarding the persistence of the planned Conto Energia III regime. Rather, the
Tribunal sees these statements about certainty at best as addressed to a specific class of
beneficiaries, namely those potential investors who would meet Conto Energia III’s own

stated criteria for entitlement to the benefits it described.

9 £1 Paso, CL-146, § 395.

150

436.

437.

In other words, Undersecretary Saglia’s statements about the Government’s goal to provide
certainty to the PV power sector through the issuance of Conto Energia III cannot be divorced
from what the eventual decree itself actually said, about (i) which PV plant projects would
have “rights” under its terms and (ii) at what point any such rights would attach. General
predictions by Government officials about a legal regime they intend to introduce cannot be
read separately from the more specific terms of what they actually introduced. Yet as the
Tribunal explains further in the next section, Conto Energia III by its terms described “rights”
of various sorts as attaching only to PV plants that actually entered into operation within
certain specified timetables; the decree was crystal clear that until plants qualified for benefits
by entering into operation, no such “rights” would attach. Given these express terms of Conto
Energia III, the Tribunal is unable to find that the general public statements made to potential
investors prior to Conto Energia III established any broader commitments to potential

investors than the terms of Conto Energia III itself provided, when it entered into effect.

iii. The specific terms of Conto Energia IT

Eskosol’s third source of alleged legitimate expectations arises from Conto Energia III itself.
Eskosol contends that the fair and equitable treatment standard “protects legitimate
expectations arising from representations and guarantees provided by the host State ... in its
legislation and regulations.”°” It posits that while “it is generally understood that the FET
standard of itself does not, in general, prevent the State from altering its law,” this proposition
is limited by an obligation not to “significantly and unfairly alter the legal framework against

which an investment was made.”®!

In its view, “[lJegal and business stability and
predictability protect[] investors against regulatory or policy changes that materially affect
investors’ rights arising from commitments of the State made through its laws.”°*? Eskosol
then points to Conto Energia III as the law which allegedly constituted such a commitment,
by providing a clear legal framework upon which Eskosol based its business plans and made

its investments.

438. By contrast, Italy argues that “an averagely diligent entrepreneur cannot presume that the

legislation will not change,” particularly in a heavily regulated market such as renewable
energy.°? In its view, “the safeguard against undesirable regulatory developments is the
recourse to stabilisation clauses or insurance policies, not the hope that the law will retain
their favourite bits (such as a policy granting access to certain advantages) until it is
convenient for them.” To the contrary, quoting Electrabel, Italy says “it is well established
that the host State is entitled to maintain a reasonable degree of regulatory flexibility to
respond to changing circumstances in the public interest.”©* In short, Italy says, “the

existence of a law cannot be mistaken for a promise that the law will not change.””°

439. The Tribunal acknowledges that there is a healthy debate in the jurisprudence regarding this

particular question, namely whether there can be a legitimate expectation of legal stability
based on the content of the laws in place, absent any extrinsic representations or assurances
about the immutability of those laws. Some tribunals have stated that no legitimate
expectation of stability can arise in these circumstances, while others have suggested that they
can. The Masdar tribunal characterized these as “two schools of thought” on the question of

legitimate expectations.’ Members of the Tribunal have taken positions on this question in

other cases. 8

schools of thought individual members of the Tribunal might adhere” with respect to legitimate expectations based on
general laws, in that case there were also specific commitments made directly to the investor; “[i]t would be difficult
to conceive of a more specific commitment than a Resolution ... addressed specifically to each of the Operating
Companies .... Because of these specific commitments, and irrespective of whether the general provisions [of law]
would be sufficient (as the first school of thought would contend was the case), the Tribunal concludes that, in any
event, Claimant had legitimate expectations that the benefits granted ... would remain unaltered.”).

8 Compare, e.g., El Paso, CL-146, 49 352, 368, 372, 394 (“[T]he Tribunal cannot follow the line of cases in which
fair and equitable treatment was viewed as implying the stability of the legal and business framework... FET cannot
be designed to ensure the immutability of the legal order ... and play the role assumed by stabilisation clauses

clause, a foreign investor can expect that the rules will not be changed without justification of an economic, social or
other nature,” but not that the State commits “never to change its legislation whatever the circumstances .... The
Tribunal however cannot consider that any rule or even clear commitment embodied in a general piece of legislation
or regulation ... is in itself a special commitment towards the foreign investors, as such a conclusion would again

In this case, however, there is no need for the Tribunal to render an abstract pronouncement
on the contours of the legitimate expectations doctrine. That is because, by its terms, Conto
Energia III did not purport to promise benefits with respect to any PV power plant unless or
until that plant actually entered into operation. Article 8 of Conto Energia III, which sets forth
the incentive tariffs at issue, begins with the threshold statement, “[t]he incentivising tariffs
referred to in this [article] shall apply to photovoltaic power plants that enter into operation
... after 31 December 2010.”° The following articles contain the same proviso, namely that
“plants ... that enter into operation” before the end of 2011 would have “the right to” the
tariffs set forth in a table, and those “that enter into operation in 2012 and 2013 [have] the
right to” such tariffs further reduced by 6% a year.’ While the language providing for a
“right” may be legally significant, so too is the stated criteria for any such right attaching,

namely entry into operation by a given date.

The same is true with respect to the grace period, or sunset clause, upon which Eskosol sets
great store. As may be recalled, Conto Energia III first referred to the “national target” of PV
power of 8,000 MW, and then to the “cumulative” PV power “that can receive the incentive
rates provided for in ... this decree,” namely 3,000 MW.”°! However, the decree also stated
that “[iJn case of depletion of the availability referred to [i.e., the 3,000 MW], the power
plants, which enter into operation within fourteen months after the dates, to be communicated
by the operator on its website, when the achievement of the [3,000 MW ceiling] are reached,

have the right to the incentivising tariffs.”7°?

incentivising tariffs.””° The very first provision referred to an application to be filed “[w]ithin

ninety days after the date when the plant [has] entered into service.”"*

443. Given these provisions, the Tribunal agrees with Italy that “incentives were linked to actual

energy production.” Italy takes the position that “[I]egitimate expectations to retain those

incentives” did accrue to “actual producers,”7”°

with the implication that if it had tried to
reduce or eliminate the tariffs already flowing to PV plant operators under Conto Energia III,
or to shorten the time period over which such operators would enjoy the tariffs, then that
indeed could have been an abrogation of legitimate expectations. But regardless of such a
hypothetical, this is not what Italy ever did. To the contrary, the Romani Decree maintained
for all such operators the 20-year flow of incentives at the tariff levels previously established

for their plants. ”°”

444. The Romani Decree also provided a roughly three month grace period, under which new

plants that came into operation by 31 May 2011 would be entitled to 20 years of the Conto
Energia III tariff levels.”°* Italy refers to this second category of plant owners, when it states
that in addition to existing operators having a legitimate expectation “to retain” prior incentive
levels, “[l]egitimate expectations to obtain [the Conto Energia III] incentives” could arise for

others “when production was imminent.” Again, however, Italy emphasizes that “Italy has

never failed to respect these expectations,”’” by providing a reasonable grace period for

plants close to completion to conclude their finishing steps.

On the facts of this case, the Tribunal does not need to decide the legitimate expectations
question for a potential third category of plant owners, namely those who succeeded in
bringing new PV plants into operation only afier 31 May 2011, but still within the dates that
Conto Energia III originally had specified for its application. For such plants, a debate
between the two “schools of thought” on legitimate expectations hypothetically could arise,
about whether Conto Energia III gave such plant owners a legitimate expectation to be able
to receive the listed tariff upon their fulfillment of its originally stated requirements,
notwithstanding the decree’s early termination. The issue in such a case would be whether the
benefits that Conto Energia III described as “rights” to be provided to a plant entering into
operation by a specified date could survive the State’s decision to change the applicable rules,
if the plant nonetheless proceeded to operation within those dates. Otherwise framed, the legal
question in this hypothetical case would be whether the ECT requires a State, after declaring
that it will provide certain “rights” to certain intended beneficiaries upon their fulfillment of
certain conditions, to uphold that promise or compensate the qualifying beneficiaries for not
doing so, even if the State acted in good faith and not arbitrarily in altering its regulatory

regime.

Here, however, that particular scenario is not presented either. Unlike the hypothetical
investor in the scenario above, Eskosol did not construct a single one of the 120 PV plants it
originally had hoped to build, and therefore no such plant entered into operation — either
within Conto Energia III’s original projected maximum timeframe (2011-2013), or within the
grace period Conto Energia III had provided in case the ceiling of 3,000 MW of additional
PV capacity was hit early (i.e., 14 months from when the 3,000 MW were achieved). In other
words, the stated preconditions for any “rights” that might have attached to such plants, under
Conto Energia III’s own terms, did not materialize. This is therefore not a situation where an

investor already has “complie[d] with all the established requirements of the current

7 Counter-Memorial, § 221 (emphasis in original).

155

447.

legislation in order to be entitled to an expected and determinable benefit,””!°

only to have
the State renege on promises for which the investor already demonstrably had qualified.
Eskosol never complied with the stated preconditions in Conto Energia III for any rights to

attach under its terms.

The Parties differ on the reasons Eskosol did not build any PV plants in Italy, much less bring
them into operation. Eskosol’s explanation is that the financing it had hoped to arrange, to
permit it to proceed with construction under the EPC Contract, became more elusive after the
Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV. It may be recalled that Eskosol signed the EPC
Contract in order to demonstrate its bona fides to potential funders, but at the same time
depended on obtaining outside financing to meet even its first payment obligation to Siemens
under that Contract. Eskosol claims that the regulatory changes in Italy interfered with its
efforts to lock down financing on terms it previously had explored with potential funders, and
that by the time it might have explored alternate financing deals — either for a project of the
original scope or for a smaller scale project involving fewer PV plants — there was no longer
time to complete plant construction, within the one-year grace period for construction that the
Romani Decree provided for plants occupying more than 10% of agricultural land plots.7!!
Italy counters that Eskosol’s inability to complete any plants was a consequence of the unique
vulnerability of its project and its own risky business decisions, including (i) a complex design
involving using many small plants to take advantage of simplified permitting procedures but
treating them as a single, unprecedently large project for purposes of exploring financing, and
(ii) deciding for tactical reasons to delay starting construction on any of the plants until
completing the electrical connections for all 120, instead of building plants gradually in

batches, in parallel with their required connections. ’!*

7° Charanne, Dissenting Opinion of Prof. Dr. Tawil, RL-63, §f 9-10, 12 (referring to a regime in Spain that required
PV plant investments to “be made, entered into the registry, and put into operation prior to the expiration of a
deadline,” and opining also that “[o]nce [an investor] made the investment, complying with all the existing
requirements of the rules governing the granting of the expected benefit..., it does not appear to ... legally acceptable
[for] the receiving State to modify or eliminate them without some legal consequence”) (emphasis added).

legality of the Project ... depended on ... small plants of less than I MW,” but “its economic viability depended on the
cumulation of those plants into a large aggregated array,” but this required “substantial financing” which “[t]he Project
never obtained”).

451.

This factual debate is interesting, but ultimately there is no need for the Tribunal to opine on
the commercial wisdom of Eskosol’s business plan, nor on whether some alternate plan might
have enabled it to adapt more readily to the 201 1 regulatory changes. The bottom line remains
that nothing in Conto Energia III purported to extend any rights to would-be developers or
operators of future plants, prior to their actual completion and commissioning. There was no
provision extending rights to entrepreneurs who hoped to build PV plants within a particular
time period; or to operators who were in the process of arranging financing based on such
plans; or to those who held DIA permits, authorizing construction to begin whenever
financing was ready; or to those who built electrical substations with the intention one day of
connecting these to future PV plants. The decree by its terms spoke only of the benefits to be
afforded plants that actually entered into operation, and made crystal clear that such entry into

operation was the critical qualifying event for any rights to attach.

In other words, even if (arguendo) Conto Energia III could be seen as creating legitimate
expectations for a defined class of beneficiaries to receive a defined type of treatment, Eskosol
simply did not fall within that defined class of beneficiaries. Under any framing of the
legitimate expectations doctrine, Eskosol therefore cannot claim an entitlement to protection
against a change in the Conto Energia III legal regime, under whose own terms it never

qualified in the first place.

iv. Agricultural land use regulations

Finally, the Tribunal sees nothing in the record that arguably could constitute a commitment,
representation or assurance to Eskosol — or to a defined class of investors to which it belonged
— that the agricultural land use regulations in effect prior to March 2011 would not be changed,
or that the effective date of any such change would be more than a year (which was the grace

period that the Romani Decree itself provided).

Eskosol does not allege that Italy ever made any promises to anyone to maintain, indefinitely
or for any specific period of time, the availability of preferential incentive tariffs for PV plants
built on up to 50% of their land parcels. Rather, its argument with respect to this issue boils
down to the assertion that (i) the prior regime so provided, (ii) Eskosol presumed, without any

State assurances, that the prior land use regime would remain in effect, (iii) it designed its

157

452.

453.

454.

project plans based on this presumption, but (iv) Italy then changed the regime, while
admittedly providing a one-year grace period, and (v) that grace period proved insufficient
for Eskosol to complete either a project of the original planned scope or any other, smaller
project. All of this may well have been true, but this was a risk that Eskosol assumed. No
conduct of Italy has been alleged to induce Eskosol to rely on a purported immutability of the
prior land use regime. Further, nothing in the prior land use regulations even purported to

address the length of time in which such regulations would remain in effect.

In other words, this is not a situation where Eskosol was affirmatively led by Italy to expect
that its prior land use regime would remain in place for a particular period of time, or would
be phased out only with a grace period of a particular length. There is no evidence of a
representation or assurance in either regard. Yet it is axiomatic that legitimate expectations
must be based on some form of State conduct, and not simply on the investor’s own subjective
expectations. Absent any evidence of such conduct, the Tribunal is unable to accept that
Eskosol had an objectively legitimate expectation regarding the longevity of the prior
agricultural land regime, and therefore that by changing its regime with a grace period of one
year, Italy contravened any such legitimate expectation in violation of Article 10(1) of the

ECT.

UMBRELLA CLAUSE

The Tribunal begins its description of Eskosol’s umbrella clause claim with the general
observation that Eskosol devoted relatively limited briefing to it, as was the case for all of its
ECT claims other than the fair and equitable treatment claim (to which it devoted substantial
attention). Italy accordingly also devoted limited space in its memorials to these non-FET

claims. The Tribunal summarizes below the limited arguments that the Parties presented.

1. Eskosol’s Position

Eskosol relies on the following provision in Article 10(1) of the ECT as a provision generally

referred to as an “umbrella clause”:

158

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it has entered into with an
investor of another contracting party.”">

455. Eskosol contends that by virtue of the phrase “any obligations” (emphasis added), this
provision must be read as extending treaty protection to commitments by host States
undertaken in a variety of formats, including through their unilateral acts and through their
domestic legislation and regulations.’'* Eskosol rejects Italy’s suggestion that the ECT’s
umbrella clause is limited to specific commitments made to a particular investor (i.e., by Italy
to Eskosol). In its view, Article 10(1) of the ECT does not contain such a requirement, and
there is general agreement in the jurisprudence (Eskosol says) that legislation alone can

amount to an undertaking under the umbrella clause.’!> In any event, Eskosol contends, the

series of iterations of Conto Energia did contain a specific commitment.7!®

456. According to Eskosol, Conto Energia III contained obligations that are covered by the last
sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT: it “guaranteed” investors incentivizing tariffs for 20
years “so long as they connected their PV plants to the electric grid by a specified time frame,
and with the benefit of a sunset provision, and a savings clause.”’!” Eskosol adds that those

commitments were further reinforced by public and private statements by Government

officials towards PV investors, including Eskosol itself.7'*

According to Eskosol, Italy violated the umbrella clause in the ECT by abrogating the
incentivizing tariffs and the sunset provision contained in Conto Energia III.’!° It rejects the
relevance of Italy’s observation that no Italian law was breached, clarifying that its claim
under the umbrella clause is not based on any asserted breach of Italian law, but rather on the
“dismantling of Italian law (i.e. Conto Energia III) that embodied Italy’s undertakings vis-a-

vis Claimant.”7”°

2. Italy’s Position

Italy denies any breach of the umbrella clause contained in Article 10(1) of the ECT.

First, Italy contends that there was no breach of Italian law susceptible of being elevated to a

Treaty violation.

Second, Italy argues that the umbrella clause in Article 10(1) requires a commitment to have
been made with respect to a specific investment or investor. “General regulatory measures
with open-ended application cannot be considered to produce commitments for specific

investors enforceable through an umbrella clause.”7*!

Third, Italy argues that even if specific investors who had qualified under Conto Energia III
could claim to have derived enforceable rights from it, Eskosol never did.’”* Eskosol never
built any PV plant, let alone an operating plant that could acquire a right to the incentivizing

tariffs.’” In Italy’s view,

the Claimant challenged certain regulatory acts that never applied to it. It is therefore
impossible that the slight modifications of the Italian incentive scheme could harm
the investor, as they concerned legal entitlements that it had never acquired and that,
in fact, [it] was never close to acquiring.”

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

462. The Tribunal is unable to accept, as a general proposition, that laws of general applicability

qualify under Article 10(1) of the ECT as “obligation[s] ... entered into with an investor of
another contracting party” (emphasis added). The very notion of “enter[ing] into” an
obligation “with an investor” implies, as a matter of ordinary meaning, that there has been
some interaction between the State and the investor, from which a particular obligation
results. In most cases, that interaction presumably would be direct, such as through a contract
or an investment authorization. Nonetheless, the Tribunal does not rule out, at least at the level
of theory, that in rare cases a State might be shown to have entered into obligations indirectly
with a given investor, for example by making a binding commitment to a narrow and targeted
class of investors in which that investor is known to fall. Even so, such obligations would be

expected to be documented in some form other than through laws of general applicability.’?°

463. In this case, there is no need to drill down further into the doctrinal debate, because as

demonstrated above, Eskosol never brought itself within the group to whom (even by its own
theory) a State commitment was made. Eskosol claims that Conto Energia III “embodied
Italy’s undertakings vis-a-vis Claimant”’”° because it supposedly “guaranteed” certain
preferential tariffs to any investor “so long as they connected their PV plants to the electric
grid by a specified time frame.”’?’ But Eskosol never connected any PV plants to the grid
within any timetable, so even by Eskosol’s own theory, it did not qualify for the class to whom
any alleged undertakings were provided. This is sufficient, on the facts, to dispose of the

umbrella clause claim under ECT Article 10(1).

D. EXPROPRIATION

464.

465.

1. Eskosol’s Position

As with its umbrella clause claim, Eskosol addresses only very briefly in its submissions the
allegations of expropriation in violation of Article 13(1) of the ECT. It begins with the
uncontroversial observation that the provision “protects investments against indirect measures

pe 9972
of expropriation,”

citing various cases for the proposition that treaty reference to “measures
having effect equivalent” or “tantamount to” nationalization or expropriation address indirect
rather than direct takings.”° To determine whether such a taking has occurred, Eskosol
proposes the Metalclad formulation about acts which have “the effect of depriving the owner,
in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be expected economic benefit of
property.”7°° It then proposes a “sole effects test,” described by the tribunal in Burlington as
examining whether “the investment as a whole has become unviable,” in the sense that it

“cannot generate a commercial return.”73!

Eskosol argues that the Romani Decree resulted in a “freezing of credit as banks were
uncertain as to the future of the incentivising tariff scheme,” and that “without funding,
[Eskosol] had to stop the construction works envisaged in the EPC Contract.””? The
uncertainty was resolved by the issuance of Conto Energia IV, but this “slashed” the tariff
levels to a degree that “no banks were willing to finance” the project, as Eskosol “was no
longer able to obtain a commercial return,” resulting in an outcome where the project “had to
be abandoned.””** In practice, Eskosol argues, Italy “neutralised and halted the Eskosol

Project and its ability to carry out its business,” thereby depriving Eskosol of the use and

enjoyment of its investment.’*4 Eskosol states that “its property rights were detrimentally

affected which amounted to an unlawful expropriation.”7*°

2. Italy’s Position

Italy rejects Eskosol’s claim that the measures amounted to unlawful expropriation.

Italy first argues that Eskosol does not establish a causal link between the Government’s
actions and any deprivation, and that such a link does not in fact exist. Italy refers to the
arguments about causation it presented in its defense to the FET claim, and states that these
are equally relevant for the expropriation analysis.”° Italy also criticizes Eskosol’s
expropriation arguments as “circular,” since Eskosol argued that Italy’s conduct was unlawful
because of the harm Eskosol allegedly suffered, but at the same time it argues that the harm
was suffered because the conduct was unlawful.”*” Italy says there is no “hard proof of a

causal link in either direction,” but at most a “temporal correlation.””*

Italy also contends that Eskosol has not proven “complete impairment” of the investment as
required to prove direct or indirect expropriation under Article 13 of the ECT, and that “[t]he
policing of indirect expropriation ... cannot stretch as far [as] covering all harmful effects that
a State measure might cause to the investment,” short of total deprivation.”° Here, Eskosol’s
property interest in the SPVs remained unaffected, and the SPVs’ interest in the lands and
DIAs they acquired “did not change at any time.””4° The “Eskosol Project” as such was simply
“a business plan,” which Eskosol continued to try to market to potential funders “long after
Conto Energia IV was passed.””4! While funders may have been skeptical of the project’s
viability, “the profitability of an asset is not a substitute for its property, use and enjoyment,”

and “[a] decrease of the former cannot be equated to a deprivation of the latter.”74? At most,

Eskosol is claiming that “its future profits were expropriated,” but (as Italy says the tribunal
in Blusun found), the reason “the benefits ... never came to fruition” was “because Claimant
never met the requirements to receive them (banally, it never built the energy plants).”” Italy
emphasizes that “[t]here is no automaticity in obtaining incentives,” and while an investor
“might expect to receive incentives once it is operational and it has respected all required
conditions under legislation, it has no entitlement until that very moment” — and in this case,
“Eskosol never even got close to that moment.” In Italy’s view, “[i]t is therefore impossible

to talk about expropriation or even deprivation of something that never existed.”7”4>

Finally, Italy argues that “no indirect expropriation can arise from the State’s exercise of its
police powers.” Italy quotes B/usun for the proposition that “the situation was not
analogous, still less tantamount, to expropriation of the Project by Italy,” because it simply
involved the State’s non-discriminatory public-interest changes to a regulatory regime, which
when “combined with operational decisions made by the investors and the lack of prearranged
Project financing, meant that the Project remained radically incomplete, never qualified for
feed-in tariffs, and inevitably went into liquidation.””*” Italy cites Methanex and other cases
for the proposition that “a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is
enacted in accordance with due process,” does not amount to expropriation simply because it
affects a foreign investor or investment.’4* Here, the measures were clearly in the public
interest, Italy says, because, they were “designed, according to a goal of effectiveness and
reasonable balance of costs, to promote renewable energy production in a sustainable way,”
and accordingly it would be “clearly excessive” to allow Eskosol to sue “in order to make up
for an estimate[d] drop in profits.”” Italy quotes Feldman for the proposition that States

“must be free to act in the broader public interest through [inter alia] the granting or

withdrawal of Government subsidies, reductions or increases in tariff levels ... and the

like.”7°

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal begins with a reminder of general principles, namely that the doctrine of
expropriation involves deprivation of protected rights in property. As the tribunal in Emmis
observed, the origin of the term expropriation is the Latin word expropriat, from the verb
expropriare, which contains the root proprium (property) as well as the prefix ex (out or
from). In consequence, a finding of expropriation must be premised on a showing that
“Claimants must have held a property right of which they have been deprived.””*! The
property right or asset in question “must have vested (directly or indirectly) in the claimant

for him to seek redress.”7>

Eskosol seems to acknowledge the required nexus between an established property right and
an expropriation claim, by contending that “its property rights were detrimentally affected
which amounted to an unlawful expropriation.””* The difficulty however is identifying what
specific property rights of Eskosol’s allegedly were taken. There is no dispute that Eskosol
retains ownership of the SPVs, which still own all of the land, assets, and contract rights that
belong to them. Eskosol also retains the ability, should it wish, to build PV power plants on
the land owned by its SPVs and connect them to the electrical grid. What Eskosol claims it
lost, as a result of the Romani Decree and Conto Energia IV, was the prospect of doing so
within a framework that would allow it to sell its power at certain prices, though the
application of a special tariff regime subsidized by consumers which would support pricing

above market levels, and thereby guarantee returns on its investment. In other words, Eskosol

complains that prior to the challenged Government acts, it had the potential to use its assets
in a way that would enhance their value to a particular extent — assuming it first could obtain
financing to build the envisioned PV plants within a projected timeframe — but that the
challenged Government acts shortened that timeframe and lowered tariffs thereafter, to such

an extent that the business plan no longer would work.

The difficulty for an expropriation analysis is that Eskosol cannot show that it had a
recognized property right to obtain this enhanced value of its assets, through participation in
the Conto Energia III tariff regime. As discussed above, Conto Energia III was clear that only
such PV plants who qualified for its benefits, by entering into operation within specified dates,
would be granted stated rights. This case does not concern any plants that so qualified, and
which therefore might try to invoke doctrines of vested rights to complain about deprivation
of any such rights with an effect on their investment that was tantamount to expropriation.”
At best, Eskosol might argue that it was well positioned to eventually secure a legal right, but
nothing in the Italian legislation transformed positioning to secure a future legal right into a
legal right as such.”° And absent any established right that was abrogated by Government
interference, the fact that Government conduct may have impacted a company business plan
does not itself amount to expropriation, even if the end result ultimately is that the company

was unable to survive financially.

For these reasons, the Tribunal comes to the same conclusion as did the B/usun tribunal,
namely that “the situation was not analogous, still less tantamount, to expropriation of the

Project by Italy.”’°° The expropriation claim therefore is denied.

754 See similarly Blusun, RL-56, § 402 (noting that “[t]he difficulty with [Blusun’s expropriation claim] lies in its
assumption that the Claimants were entitled to ... the full benefit of current FITs — without complying with the
conditions consistently imposed on applicants for FITs, i.e. timely completion of the solar panels and their connection

to the grid”).

qualified).

E. CONSTANT PROTECTION AND SECURITY

1. Eskosol’s Position

Eskosol states that, by providing that “investments shall also enjoy the most constant
protection and security,” Article 10(1) of the ECT imposes upon States an obligation of
vigilance and due diligence.’*’ Citing a number of international investment law authorities,
Eskosol argues that “the scope of legal protection to be afforded to an investment under the
full protection and security clause extends to providing legal stability, and certainty in legal
norms.”’°* Contrary to Italy’s position, Eskosol contends that the “legal stability” view of full
protection and security is not defeated by contentions that the FET obligation also protects
legal stability, since FET and full protection and security are two distinct ECT protections

that must be assessed separately.’°°

Under this standard, Eskosol contends that Italy “was required actively to protect Eskosol’s
investments,” which “involved, in particular, and at the very least, the application of the legal
and regulatory framework that it had established specifically to ensure the viability and legal
and economic protection and security of investments such as Eskosol’s.””°° According to
Eskosol, Italy failed to protect Eskosol by passing the Romani Decree and Conto Energia

2. Italy’s Position

Italy rejects Eskosol’s claim that it breached its full protection and security obligation.” It

contends that Eskosol’s interpretation of the standard follows a minoritarian view,” and that
the obligation includes only protection of an investment’s physical integrity. Under Eskosol’s
broader construction of the standard, Italy argues, the contours of full protection and security

would overlap with those of the FET standard.”

Based on Italy’s narrower view of the applicable standard, it rejects Eskosol’s full protection
and security claim “because no act attributable to Italy threatened the integrity of the investors,

the investment, and their assets.””

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

Given the relatively limited attention the Parties paid to this claim,” this is not the occasion
for the Tribunal to enter into a lengthy and detailed explication of its members’ respective
nuanced views on the standard. It suffices to say that whatever framing the ECT’s “constant
security and protection” standard is given, the Tribunal does not believe Italy violated it on

the facts of this case.

First, that conclusion is self-evident if the standard is considered to be limited to its original
customary international law dimensions, of a due diligence obligation to protect the physical
security of Eskosol’s investment from harm by third parties. There is no allegation that any

of Eskosol’s property, assets or personnel were ever threatened by anyone.

Second, if the standard were considered to be somewhat wider, to encompass “/egal security”

in the limited sense of a State’s obligation to provide investors with access to reasonable

avenues of judicial redress,’°’ there equally is no violation, because Eskosol has not alleged

any insufficiency in this regard.

481. Finally, even if (arguendo) the constant protection and security standard were to be given a

broader interpretation as entailing some element of “/egal stability’ (which the Tribunal does
not accept), the fact remains that even under this construction, the standard still would be one
of “due diligence,” embodying notions of reasonable care, and not a “strict liability” standard
or an obligation of result. This conclusion is in line with the International Court of Justice’s
warning that the provision of constant protection and security “cannot be construed as the
giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or
disturbed,””°* and numerous tribunals have agreed on this point.” Accordingly, even
tribunals that might see constant protection and security as including some component of
“legal stability” should accept that the obligation would not require some absolute freezing of
regulatory frameworks in place, but simply that due diligence (or reasonable care) be taken to
protect against unnecessary or disproportionate upheaval and associated harm to investments,
taking into account also the rationale and urgency of a particular regulatory change. In this
case, as discussed supra, Italy did take reasonable care to provide protection to those PV
sector investors who already were fairly far along in their PV plant development plans, both
by providing grace periods for them still to qualify under prior regulatory regimes (e.g., three
months for the Conto Energia III tariffs, one year for the agricultural land rules that would

enable investors to take advantage of Conto Energia IV) and by allowing plant developers to

the duty to put at the claimant’s disposal “the ... tools for obtaining redress”); Parkerings, RL-59, | 360 (finding a
treaty duty to for a State to “keep it judicial system available for the Claimant to bring its contractual claims” and for
such claims to “be properlty examined in accordance with domestic and international law by a impartial and fair
court”); see also A.M.F. Aircrafileasing Meier & Fischer GmbH & Co. KG yv. Czech Republic, PCA Case No. 2017-

but noting in any event that the concept of due diligence “does not mean that the State has to prevent each and every
injury,” but only to “take reasonable actions within its power to avoid injury when it is, or should be, aware that there
isa risk of injury. The precise degree of care, of what is ‘reasonable’ or ‘due,’ depends in part on the circumstances.”)

begin the qualification process for Conto Energia IV at an earlier stage of development (by
registering during construction rather than applying only after commissioning and entry into

operation).

In these circumstances, the same conclusion would be warranted under any doctrinal approach
to constant protection and security that still recognizes the central notion of “due diligence”
embodied in the standard. That is because a due diligence obligation cannot be stretched to
require a State to provide transitional mechanisms that would cover all possible investors, at
any stage of their development plans whatsoever, from any possible impact of regulatory
change, in circumstances (as here) where that change took the form of general sector-wide
enactment that were not discriminatory, were taken in good faith, and were reasonably related

to a rational public policy goal.

For these reasons, Eskosol’s “constant protection and security” claim under Article 10(1) is

denied.

IMPAIRMENT BY UNREASONABLE OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES
1. Eskosol’s Position

Finally, Eskosol notes that Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that “no contracting Party shall
in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures [the investments’]
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.”””° It contends that this is a flexible
and broad standard, which should be interpreted in light of all the circumstances of the case.””!
Relying on the National Grid award, Eskosol also contends that the term “unreasonable”

should have the same meaning as “arbitrary.”7”

Eskosol states that the analysis it presented regarding the FET and full protection and security

standards applies equally to this standard. It argues that Italy breached its obligation of

reasonableness by considerably altering the rights created by the legal framework in which

Eskosol invested, and by doing so “capriciously, and without any justifiable reason.”””°

2. Italy’s Position

Italy argues that Eskosol has failed to explain why this claim should warrant separate
treatment from the FET claim, given that Eskosol simply “rehashes the reasoning on
reasonableness that it employed to advance the FET and FPS allegations.” Italy refers the

Tribunal to its arguments regarding those allegations.”

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

,’7> as well as

The Tribunal again notes the brevity of the Parties’ briefing on this standard.
their mutual cross-reference for its content to other ECT standards that the Tribunal already
has addressed. In particular, Eskosol does not allege discrimination, so this claim boils down
to an allegation of impairment of its investment “by unreasonable ... measures,” and Eskosol
contends that the term “unreasonable” should have the same meaning as “arbitrary” — which
the Tribunal extensively addressed in connection with the FET claim. Italy agrees that the
claim should be addressed under the same rubric of reasonableness considered for the FET

claim.

In these circumstances, there is nothing further for the Tribunal to decide, beyond noting the
relevance of the issues it already has decided.’”° Specifically, the Tribunal has found that the
challenged measures did not violate the ECT on account of alleged arbitrariness. The

equivalently framed claim for unreasonableness fails on the same basis.

75 See Memorial, §f] 363-367 (presenting the claim in four paragraphs); Counter-Memorial, 4] 378-379 (opposing the
claim in two paragraphs, which simply cross reference arguments in other sections). Neither Party provided any
additional briefing in its respective Reply or Rejoinder or Post-Hearing Brief.

716

See generally Greentech, CL-195, §§ 400, 403 (agreeing with the Novoenergia tribunal that “[uJnder the rationale

of procedural economy it is generally accepted that an arbitral tribunal does not need to address claims and issues that
are already implied in those that are essential to its decision,” but that where applicable procedural rules require a
tribunal ruling on each separate request for relief, tribunals should do so while keeping their reasons brief).

171

G. CONCLUSION ON LIABILITY

489.

For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal denies Eskosol’s various liability claims, including
specifically its claims for breach of the obligations under Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT
with respect to (i) the fair and equitable treatment standard, (ii) the umbrella clause, (iii)
expropriation, (iv) constant protection and security, and (v) to unreasonable or discriminatory
measures.’”’ Because Eskosol has not succeeded on any of its liability claims, there is no need
for the Tribunal to summarize or resolve the Parties’ respective positions with respect to any
damages. The Tribunal therefore proceeds below to the only remaining issue, which is the

assessment and allocation of costs in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.

VIII. COSTS

A. ESKOSOL’S COST SUBMISSION

490.

In its submission on costs, Eskosol reiterates its request that the Tribunal issue an award

other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID):7”8

Legal fees: €4,729,083
Winston & Strawn LLP €4,462,083
AVV Giuseppe Spagnolo € 267,000

B. ITALY’s COST SUBMISSION

491. Italy claims that Eskosol should bear all the costs and expenses of these proceedings. It

submits the following claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID):7”

Attendances: € 400,000 ($ 459,132)
Legal Fees: € 500,000 ($ 573,914)
Costs: € 70,000 ($ 80,348)
Attendance at Hearing: € 20,000($ 22,957)
TOTAL: €_990,000 ($1,136,351)

C. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

492. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and
expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities
of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

493. This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including

attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

494. The Tribunal notes that in many ICSID cases, each party bears its own costs, while in other
cases costs follow the event. In this case, however, even the latter principle would require
some nuanced application. While Italy ultimately prevailed on the merits, Eskosol prevailed
in relation to significant non-merits issues, including Italy’s objection under Rule 41(5), its
application for immediate termination, its application for suspension, and its various
jurisdictional objections. Those applications and objections contributed to the overall costs of

these proceedings, and indeed occasioned two prior lengthy decisions by the Tribunal, the

7 Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal dated 18 January 2019.

173

495.

496.

497.

498.

499.

Decision on Rule 41(5) Objection and the Decision on Termination. In the Tribunal’s view,
it would not be appropriate to ignore those facts in considering the ultimate allocation of costs.
Ultimately, considering that both Parties prevailed to some significant extent, the Tribunal
concludes that each Party should bear 50% of the costs of the arbitration, and should continue

to bear its own direct costs incurred in connection with the proceeding.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount (in USD) to $ 765,634.54.7°°
The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties as follows:

Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione: $ 524,928
Italian Republic: $ 407,740.02

As a result of the Tribunal’s ruling that each Party shall bear 50% of the costs of the

arbitration, each Party’s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to $ 382,817.27.”*!
Accordingly, as the Parties each have already borne 50% of the costs of the arbitration, no
order of recovery of costs is due to either Party from the other.

AWARD
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(1) The Respondent’s request for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and/or inadmissibility

is denied.

(2) The Claimant’s request for a declaration that Italy has breached its obligations under

the ECT and/or international law is denied.

(3) Specifically, the Claimant’s request for a declaration that Italy’s actions and

omissions are unfair and inequitable; unreasonable; have failed to protect Eskosol’s

780 A breakdown of these figures will be provided to the Parties by the ICSID Secretariat.

78! The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

174

(4)

Investments; have failed to observe its obligations under the “umbrella clause” in the
ECT; or have effectively expropriated Eskosol’s Investments without prompt,

adequate and effective compensation, are each denied.

Both Parties’ requests for an award of costs are denied.
