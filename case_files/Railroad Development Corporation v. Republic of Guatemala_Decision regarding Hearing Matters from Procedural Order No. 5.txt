Re: Railroad Devel: Corporation v. Republic of G
(ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23)

Dear Mesdames and Sirs,
The President of the Tribunal has asked me to convey to you the following:

“The Tribunal considers that the parties had sufficient opportunity to exchange views on
Procedural Order No. 5. In that respect the Tribunal wishes:

= To confirm that a party may include in its list, witnesses presented by the other party.
However, as indicated by Respondent, if one party requests the presence of a witness that is
not on the other party’s list of witnesses to be examined, the party that did not list the witness
for cross-examination should be limited to cross-examining that witness only on the issues
discussed in the witness’ direct examination at the hearing, not on every issue covered by the
witness’ written statement.

= To confirm that the hearing will be conducted on an equal time basis.

2 December 14, 2009

= To confirm that fact witnesses may not be present in the hearing room except for their
own cross-examination. Mr. Posner may attend the opening statements of counsel and be in
the hearing room after his testimony.

= Given that each party intends to cross-examine all witnesses presented by the other, to
confirm the deadline for the parties to reach agreement on the sequence of witnesses.

= Within its overall allotted time, each party may extend the time allotted to direct
examination of its witnesses.”

Sincerely yours,

DleesD

Natali Sequeira
Secretary of the Tribunal
