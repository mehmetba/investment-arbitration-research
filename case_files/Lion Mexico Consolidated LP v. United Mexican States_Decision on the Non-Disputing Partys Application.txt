Re: Lion Mexico Consolidated L.P. v United Mexican States
(ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/15/2)

Dear Mesdames and Sirs,

I write to you as instructed by the President of the Tribunal. Within the past year Mr. Ivan Mercado

has addressed the following letters to this Tribunal and ICSID, seeking the Tribunal’s leave to
participate as a non-disputing party in this arbitration: letter of May 30, 2016; letter of June 20, 2016;
letter of August 24, 2016; and letter of April 20, 2017. These communications include certain legal
arguments with regard to these proceedings, inform of the existence of a number of ongoing judicial
procedures in Mexico, and attach a few exhibits in support of his contentions.

At the Tribunal’s request, on May 17, 2017, the Parties submitted their positions on whether this
Tribunal should allow Mr. Mercado’s applications, the procedural treatment they should receive, and
any other contention they wished to make in this regard.

The Parties agree that, in this case, the Tribunal should apply to Mr. Mercado’s request the
procedure and requisites described in the Statement of the Free Trade Commission on Non-Disputing
Party Participation, of October 7, 2003 [the “Statement’”]. The Tribunal concurs with the Parties’
common position. The Statement suggests an effective and well-balanced procedure to deal with this
kind of petitions. In fact, most NAFTA tribunals have followed its recommendations in the past, at the
Parties’ request or on its own motion.

Furthermore, the Parties agree, and the Tribunal concurs, that Mr. Mercado’s petitions have not
fulfilled the requisites set out in the Statement. For instance, Mr. Mercado’s communications do not
clarify many particulars regarding his identity and background, as the Statement demands.

For the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal rejects Mr. Mercado’s applications to file a written
submission as a non-disputing party in this arbitration.

Yours sincerely,

[signed]
Anneliese Fleckenstein
Secretary of the Tribunal
