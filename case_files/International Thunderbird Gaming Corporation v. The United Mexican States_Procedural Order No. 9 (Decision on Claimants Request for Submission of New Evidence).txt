Monterey and the Reflejos facilities in Rio Bravo and Reynosa;

Thunderbird’s letter of 13 August 2004, further to its letter of 3 August 2004,
requesting the Tribunal to admit into evidence “what it understands to be a complete
copy of the Office of Internal Control file pertaining to the ongoing investigation”;

Mexico’s letter of 17 August 2004 (received on 27 August 2004), as directed by the
Tribunal by letter of 16 August 2004, objecting to the requests made by Thunderbird
to admit new evidence in its letters of 3, 10, and 13 August 2004;

Paragraph 12.8 of Order No. 1, which provides: “Neither party shall be permitted to
submit additional or responsive documents after the dates for the SoR and SoRej,
save under exceptional circumstances as determined by the Tribunal. If the Tribunal
grants an application for submission of an additional or responsive document after the
afore-mentioned dates, the Tribunal shall ensure that the other party be afforded
sufficient opportunity to make its observations concerning such a document”;

That although the complaint filed by Mr. de Velasco on 30 November 2001 (referred
to in Thunderbird’s letters of 3 and 13 August 2004) was not submitted at an earlier
stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal considers on the other hand that Mr. Chavez’s
response of 20 July 2004 and the re-opening of an investigation into Mr. Velasco’s
complaint constitute prima facie new and exceptional circumstances within the
meaning of paragraph 12.8 of Order No. 1;

That, similarly, the events referred to in Thunderbird’s letter of [0 August 2004
surrounding the operations of the Bella Vista and Reflejos facilities constitute prima
facie exceptional circumstances within the meaning of paragraph 12.8 of Order No. 1;
