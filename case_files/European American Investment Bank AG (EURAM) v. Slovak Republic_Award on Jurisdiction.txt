Republic concerning the Promotion and Protection of Investments, dated 15 October

1990 (the “BIT”).

In its Notice of Arbitration, the Claimant appointed the Hon. Charles N. Brower as the
first arbitrator. By letter dated 8 December 2009, the Respondent challenged the
Claimant’s appointment of Judge Brower. The Claimant accepted the challenge and,
by letter dated 15 December 2009, appointed Dr Dr Alexander Petsche as the first
arbitrator. By letter dated 14 January 2010, the Respondent notified the Claimant of its
appointment of Professor Brigitte Stern as the second arbitrator. The Claimant
submitted a challenge to Professor Stern’s appointment pursuant to Article 13(2) of the
UNCITRAL Rules in a letter dated 28 January 2010. By letter dated 2 February 2010,
Professor Stern submitted her comments and affirmed that she was committed to the

“deontological requirements for an arbitrator.”

In a letter dated 15 February 2010, the Claimant proposed to the Respondent the
designation of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) as
Appointing Authority in this case. The Respondent agreed, by letter of 19 February
2010, that the PCA should act as the Appointing Authority. By letter dated 26 February
2010, the Claimant requested that the Secretary-General of the PCA sustain the
Claimant’s challenge of Professor Stern. By letter to the Parties dated 8 March 2010,
the Secretary-General of the PCA set out a schedule of submissions whereby the
Respondent would provide a response to the Claimant’s request by 15 March 2010 and

Professor Stern would be able to submit comments by 22 March 2010.

By letter dated 15 March 2010, the Respondent submitted its response on the challenge
to its party-appointed arbitrator, requesting that the challenge be denied. By letter dated
21 March 2010, Professor Stern reiterated her views that she is a “dedicated and
scrupulous arbitrator.” By letter dated 29 March 2010, the Claimant submitted its
rebuttal to the Respondent’s response. By letter dated 5 April 2010, the Respondent
submitted its comments to the Claimant’s rebuttal and requested a reasoned decision by
the Appointing Authority. On 12 April 2010, the Secretary-General of the PCA

rejected the challenge to Professor Stern in a reasoned decision.

and a merits phase.

On 2 December 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, which detailed the

deadlines for the jurisdictional phase of the proceeding as follows:

1. The Tribunal notes that, on 5 November 2010, the Respondent filed an objection to the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal, together with a request for bifurcation of the proceedings and
that, on 30 November 2010, the Claimant sent to the Tribunal a letter accepting the

30 November 2010, the Tribunal concludes that the Parties have agreed that the
proceedings should be bifurcated and that issues of jurisdiction should be addressed in the
first phase of the proceedings (hereinafter the “jurisdictional phase”).

determines that the schedule for the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings shall be as

By letter dated 4 April 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Slovak
Republic’s challenge of the Eureko B.V. v. The Slovak Republic award in the Higher

Regional Court of Frankfurt (“Frankfurt Court”).’

By letter dated 21 May 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the decision by the

Eureko B.V. v. The Slovak Republic award (“Frankfurt Court Decision”).*

On 26 May 2012, the Respondent submitted a Supplementary Statement of Defence,

raising further jurisdictional objections.

By letter dated 28 May 2012, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal dismiss the

Respondent’s Supplementary Statement of Defence as untimely.

By letter dated 30 May 2012, pursuant to the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent

submitted its comments on the Frankfurt Court Decision.

defer any consideration of the jurisdictional objections contained in the Respondent’s
Supplementary Statement of Defence until after it had rendered an award on the
original jurisdictional objections. The present award is, therefore, without prejudice to
the admissibility or the merits of the objections referred to in the Respondent’s

Supplementary Statement of Defence.

C. THE PROVISIONS OF THE BIT

The BIT under which the present proceedings have been brought was concluded on 15
October 1990 between the Federal Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak
Federal Republic. It entered into force on 1 October 1991. The Czech and Slovak
Federal Republic was dissolved and Slovakia became an independent State on 1

January 1993. The Parties agree that the BIT became binding on the Slovak Republic

* See 491248 et seq., below.

by succession. The Respondent maintains that the BIT became binding on the Slovak

Republic with effect from 1 January 1995.‘

The BIT is authentic in Czech and German. The Czech and German texts are attached
to the Award as Annexes | and 2, respectively. The English translation published in
the United Nations Treaty Series (“UNTS”) is attached as Annex 3 and the translation
on which the Claimant initially relied (which was attached to its pleadings as
Attachment C1), which is closely based upon the UNTS version, is attached as Annex
4. The Respondent submitted its own translations into English from the Czech and
German texts (Exhibits RL-40A and RL-40B) which are attached as Annexes 5 and 6,
respectively. Finally, after the conclusion of the oral proceedings, the Claimant
submitted a new translation into English which appears at Annex 7. The Tribunal
addresses the differences between the Parties regarding the translations in Chapter III of

this Award.

Article 1 of the BIT defines the terms “investment”, “investor” and “earnings”. The
extent of the definitions is considered in Chapter IV of the Award. Article 2 provides,
inter alia, that each Party shall accord fair and equitable treatment to investments made
in its territory by investors of the other Party and that such investments and the earnings
which they generate shall have the full protection of the BIT. Article 3 is a most-
favoured-nation clause, the scope of which will be considered in Chapter V(C) of the
Award. Article 4, which is entitled “Compensation” provides for compensation to a
qualifying investor in the event of expropriation, nationalization or similar measures.
Its scope, and relationship to other provisions in the BIT, is considered in detail in
Chapter V(A) of the Award. Article 5 requires each Party to guarantee to investors of
the other Party the free transfer, without delay, of payments, including earnings, in
connection with an investment. Article 8 provides for arbitration between a Party to the
BIT and an investor of the other Party, at the investor’s request, of certain disputes
regarding Articles 4 and 5 of the BIT. As such, it is Article 8 which is the source of
any jurisdiction which the Tribunal may possess. Its scope is keenly contested between

the Parties and is discussed in detail in Chapter V(A) of the Award.

D. STATEMENT OF FACTS

The subject matter of the dispute concerns the Claimant’s interest in Chemicka
zdravotna poist’ovia Apollo (hereinafter “Apollo”), a health insurance company
organised under the laws of the Slovak Republic. The following section sets out the
Parties’ submissions regarding the facts insofar as these are relevant to the issues before

the Tribunal in the current phase of the proceedings.

Apollo was founded in 1994 as a public health insurance provider and was converted
from a statutory health insurance company to a private joint stock company in 2005
after the Slovak Republic adopted reforms to the health insurance company regulations
of 2004.°

On 19 December 2006, the Claimant’s Slovak subsidiary, EIC a.s. (“EIC”), purchased
a 51% shareholding in Apollo.

EIC’s proposed acquisition of Apollo required the
approval of the Health Care Supervision Office and the Slovak Anti-Monopoly Office
(“AMO”). According to the Respondent, EIC represented to the AMO that it was
acting independently of the Claimant and that the Claimant did not perform any
activities in the Slovak Republic. The AMO approved the transaction on 16 April
2007, noting that “on the basis of ownership of the shares representing 100% interest in
the registered capital, the entrepreneur E.I.C. is exclusively controlled by the

entrepreneur European American Investment Bank.”

In 2006, there was a general election in the Slovak Republic, as a result of which a new
government came to power. On 24 November 2007, the National Council of the
Slovak Republic adopted Act No. 530/2007 Coll. (‘Amendment I”), which amended

the 2004 law on health insurance companies. A second Amendment, Act No. 594/2007
Coll. (‘Amendment II”), was adopted on 19 December 2007. Amendments I and II
entered into force on | January 2008. These Amendments prohibited Slovak public
health insurance providers from distributing as dividends profits derived from public
health insurance and required them to reinvest all such profits in the provision of public

health care. EIC sold its shareholding in Apollo in May 2008.

The Claimant maintains that the effect of the Amendments was to destroy the value of
its investment, because Apollo was no longer able to remit profits to EIC, and that the
Amendments therefore amounted to expropriation, or a measure similar to
expropriation, within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT, as well as violating the
requirement of fair and equitable treatment in Article 2 of the BIT and the provisions of
Article 5 of the BIT regarding transfers. It estimates that the value of its investment in
Apollo as at 23 November 2007 (i.e. the day before the promulgation of the
Amendments) was EUR 131,400,000.'' The Claimant seeks an award of not less than
EUR 131,400,000, together with interest and costs.'? The Respondent denies that the
Amendments amounted to expropriation or a measure similar to expropriation and that

they were contrary to Articles 2 and 5 of the BIT."*

E. THE RESPONDENT’S JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS

The Respondent raises four objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal:

(1) (the intra-EU BIT objection) that the arbitration provision of the BIT is no
longer applicable, because the Respondent and Austria are both Member
States of the European Union (“EU”). The Respondent puts this argument in
three different ways. First, it maintains that, under international law, the BIT
must be considered to have been terminated when the Slovak Republic joined
the EU in 2003, because the EU treaties (collectively referred to in the Award
as the “ECT”) and the BIT deal with the same subject-matter and their

provisions are incompatible. Secondly, the Respondent contends that, even if
the BIT was not terminated when Slovakia joined the EU, the arbitration
provision in Article 8 of the Treaty is incompatible with the EU treaties and
therefore inapplicable under international law. Thirdly, the Respondent
advances the argument that, as a matter of EU law, which forms part of the /ex

arbitri, Article 8 of the BIT can no longer be applied;

(2) (the indirect investment objection) that, in any event, the claims do not arise
out of a qualifying investment, because it was not the Claimant which owned
shares in Apollo but its subsidiary, EIC, a company incorporated in the Slovak

Republic;

(3) (the Article 8 objection) that the Claimant’s claims under Articles 2 and 4 of
the BIT fall outside the scope of the arbitration provisions in Article 8, since
Article 8 provides for investor-State arbitration only in respect of disputes
regarding Article 5 of the BIT and disputes regarding the amount, or
arrangements for payment, of compensation in respect of Article 4 and do not
confer upon the Tribunal jurisdiction to determine whether or not there has
been an expropriation or similar measure within Article 4 or whether such a

measure was unlawful;

(4) (the procedural objection) in relation to the claims for alleged breach of
Article 2 of the BIT, the Respondent maintains that the Claimant did not
comply with the requirement to provide a pre-arbitration notice sufficiently
specifying the claims or with the requirement to attempt to negotiate a
settlement and that compliance with these conditions is a prerequisite to the

establishment of jurisdiction.
49. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should dismiss all four objections:

(1) with regard to the intra-EU BIT objection, the Claimant denies that either the
BIT as a whole or the arbitration provisions in Article 8 is incompatible with

the EU treaties;

50.

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction
22 October 2012

Page 20 of 160

(2) with regard to the indirect investment objection, the Claimant contends that the
BIT protects the investments of investors of one State Party in the territory of
the other State Party irrespective of whether the investment is made through a

locally incorporated subsidiary;

(3) with regard to the Article 8 objection, the Claimant denies that the provision
restricts the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in the manner suggested by the
Respondent with regard to a claim under Article 4 of the BIT but argues that,
even if it does, the question whether or not the Amendments were unlawful
has already been decided by the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic.
Moreover, the Claimant argues that the provisions of Article 8 have to be read
in the light of Article 3(1) of the BIT (the “MFN clause”) which requires the
Respondent to accord the Claimant treatment no less favourable than that
accorded to investors of third States and contends that the Slovak Republic is
party to a number of bilateral investment treaties which accord investors a
right to bring arbitration proceedings in respect of alleged unfair and
inequitable treatment and in respect of all aspects of alleged expropriation or

similar measures;

(4) with regard to the procedural objection, the Claimant denies that compliance
with the procedural requirements relied on by the Respondent is a condition
for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and maintains that it has, in any event,

complied with those requirements.

It is common ground between the Parties that if the Respondent succeeds on either the
intra-EU BIT objection or the indirect investment objection, the result will be to deprive
the Tribunal of jurisdiction in respect of all the claims. Ifthe Respondent succeeds on
its Article 8 objection, the Tribunal will be deprived of jurisdiction in respect of the
claims under Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT but its jurisdiction to address the claims under
Article 5 of the BIT will be unaffected. The procedural objection applies only to the
claims for alleged breach of Article 2 of the BIT.

II. FIRST OBJECTION: THE INTRA-EU BIT ISSUE

A. INTRODUCTION

55. The Respondent’s intra-EU BIT objection has three separate strands.

56. First, the Respondent considers that the BIT as a whole is not applicable by virtue of
the principle stated in Article 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,
1969 (“VWCLT”), having been terminated by the accession of Slovakia to the European
Union in 2004, since it considers that the ECT, to which Slovakia became party on
accession, is incompatible with the BIT."° Article 59 VCLT provides, in relevant part

as follows:

Article 59
Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty implied by conclusion of a
later treaty

1. A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later
treaty relating to the same subject matter and:

(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties
intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or

(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the
earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.

2. The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it
appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the intention
of the parties.

57. Secondly, even if the BIT as a whole has not been terminated, the Respondent
maintains that Article 8 cannot be applied, by virtue of the principle in Article 30(3) of
the VCLT, as it considers Article 8 to be incompatible with EU law."’ Article 30 of the
VCLT provides as follows:

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction
22 October 2012

Page 24 of 160

Article 30
Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and
obligations of States Parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject
matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as
incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty
prevail.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but
the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the
earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those
of the later treaty.

58. The Respondent summarises these two ways of putting its case in the Memorial on
Jurisdiction:

First, the Treaty ceased to be available as a basis for the arbitration of BIT
claims because under international law it must be considered to have been
terminated by the treaty granting Slovakia membership in the EU, or,
alternatively, because the Treaty’s investor-State arbitration clause became
inoperative due to its incompatibility with EU law.'*

59. Thirdly, independently of the application of the VCLT, the Respondent argues that this
pre-eminence of EU law has to apply in any case, because EU law, as part of Swedish
law, is part of the /ex arbitri of this UNCITRAL arbitration (Section E) and thereby
renders Article 8 of the BIT inapplicable.’

60. The Claimant argues that Article 8 of the BIT, and the BIT as a whole, are unaffected
by Slovakia’s accession to the European Union.” In support of its argument, the
Claimant discusses Articles 30, 59 and 65 of the VCLT. It also refers, in particular, to
the awards of the tribunals in Eureko B.V. v. Slovak Republic’! and Eastern Sugar B.V.

v. Czech Republic,” in which, it maintains, the precise arguments now advanced by the

Respondent have already been rejected.

In its amicus curiae brief, submitted pursuant to the invitation of the Tribunal,” the
European Commission maintains that the BIT deals with “subject matters that fall
squarely within the scope of the [ECT], specifically the rules on foreign investment
activity including post-establishment treatment and operation” and is incompatible
with the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality in EU law. It
maintains that EU law takes precedence over any conflicting provisions of a treaty
between EU Member States and notes that a private party cannot rely on such a treaty
to take advantage of dispute settlement mechanisms that conflict with EU law.*> The
amicus curiae brief submitted by the Czech Republic also contends that the BITs which
it concluded with other EU Member States have been rendered obsolete on the
accession of the Czech Republic to the EU and that, in accordance with Articles 59 and
30(3) of the VCLT, Article 8 of the BIT should be regarded as having been
terminated.” By contrast, the Republic of Austria considers that the BIT is still in force
and endorses the reasoning of the tribunals in Eureko and Eastern Sugar, concluding

that the BIT and the ECT do not deal with the same subject-matter.”

The Tribunal will consider each of the three variations of the intra-EU BIT objection in
turn. Before doing so, however, it is necessary to consider the threshold question of

whether the VCLT is applicable to the relation between the BIT and the ECT.
B. WHETHER THE VCLT Is APPLICABLE

1. The Positions of the Parties

The initial position of the Respondent was that the VCLT, as a treaty to which the
Slovak Republic succeeded in 1993, is applicable to the relationship between the BIT

and the ECT.** For the Respondent, the ECT forms part of international law, so that it

is international law which must determine the relationship of the ECT with all the other
treaties to which the Slovak Republic is party, including the BIT.” Without taking a
clear theoretical position on the applicability of the VCLT in its Memorial on
Jurisdiction, the Respondent in practice analysed the relationship between the BIT and

the ECT by reference to Articles 59 and 30(3) of the VCLT.”

The Claimant responds that the ECT is not an ordinary treaty and that EU law should
not be regarded as part of international law but rather as a body of law which forms part
of the law of each Member State. In the Claimant’s view, “European Union law is not
part of ordinary international law’*', so that the VCLT is not applicable to the
relationship of the ECT with international treaties such as the BIT. In other words,
“this special legal character of EU law — as being domestic, rather than international
law, leads to the conclusion that neither Article 30 nor Article 59 VCLT are applicable

in the present case.”*

The Claimant also advances a separate argument that, if the VCLT is applicable to the
relationship between the BIT and the ECT, and if the two agreements are indeed
incompatible, the BIT should not be regarded as having been terminated, because the
Slovak Republic has not followed the procedure for termination required by Article 65

ofthe VCLT. Article 65 of the VCLT provides as follows:

Article 65
Procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity, termination, withdrawal from
or suspension of the operation of a treaty

1. A party which, under the provisions of the present Convention, invokes either a
defect in its consent to be bound by a treaty or a ground for impeaching the
validity of a treaty, terminating it, withdrawing from it or suspending its operation,
must notify the other parties of its claim. The notification shall indicate the
measure proposed to be taken with respect to the treaty and the reasons therefor.

2. If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of special urgency, shall
not be less than three months after the receipt of the notification, no party has
raised any objection, the party making the notification may carry out in the manner
provided in article 67 the measure which it has proposed.

3. If, however, objection has been raised by any other party, the parties shall seek
a solution through the means indicated in Article 33 of the Charter of the United
Nations.

4. Nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall affect the rights or obligations of the
parties under any provisions in force binding the parties with regard to the
settlement of disputes.

5. Without prejudice to article 45, the fact that a State has not previously made the
notification prescribed in paragraph | shall not prevent it from making such
notification in answer to another party claiming performance of the treaty or
alleging its violation.
In its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent maintains that the VCLT, as such, is not
applicable, because Article 4 of the VCLT provides that the VCLT is applicable only to
treaties concluded by States after the VCLT became applicable to them. The
Respondent contends that the VCLT entered into force for it in 1993, whereas it must
be deemed to have concluded the BIT in 1990 or 1991. Nevertheless, according to the
Respondent, Articles 59 and 30(3) of the VCLT state rules of customary international
law which are applicable even though the VCLT, qua treaty, is not. It argues, however,
that the provisions of Article 65 of the VCLT did not reflect customary international

law and were, therefore, inapplicable with regard to the present case.

As an answer to this new argument on the part of the Respondent, the Claimant
maintains, in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, that the BIT cannot be regarded as having
been concluded by Slovakia until it became binding upon Slovakia in 1995. It was
therefore concluded subsequent to the VCLT and the VCLT is applicable in its

entirety.*

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal will first examine the general issue of the applicability of the VCLT to the
relationship between an intra-EU BIT and the ECT, as well as the law flowing from the
ECT, and will then deal separately with the issue of the applicability or non-
applicability of the VCLT to the particular BIT in this case in light of the State

succession that followed the dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic.

69.

70.

71.

72.

The Tribunal begins by stating that, in its opinion, EU law is part of international law,
even if, at the same time, it is also part of the internal legal order of each EU Member
State. This dual nature of EU law has already been underscored by the AES tribunal,
which stated:

Regarding the Community competition law regime, it has a dual nature: on the one

hand, it is an international law regime, on the other hand, once introduced in the

national legal orders, it is part of these legal orders.**
EU law is international law, first and foremost because it is based upon an international
treaty, the ECT. It was for that reason that the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”)

stated, in the famous and often cited case Van Gend en Loos, that

The Community constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit
of which the states have limited their sovereign rights .

 

It is the Tribunal’s view that EU law is a subsystem of public international law. The
fact that EU law has some special features — like the direct effect of some of its
decisions in the national legal orders of its Member States — and forms part of national
law does not render this corpus of rules completely different from international law,
which is also incorporated — whether automatically in monist countries or through the

requisite constitutional procedure in dualist countries — into national legal orders.

The tribunal in the Eureko case, applying a Slovak BIT similar to the one at issue here,

has also recognised that EU law is part of international law:

In the view of the Tribunal, the proper framework for its analysis of these
arguments is, in the first place, the framework applicable to the legal instrument
from which the Tribunal derives its prima facie jurisdiction. Just as the Court of
Justice of the European Communities has held that its own perspective is dictated
by the treaties that established it, so the perspective of this Tribunal must begin
with the instrument by which and the legal order within which consent originated,

ie., the first stage described above. That framework is the BIT and international

law, including applicable EU law.*®
Since EU law has to be analysed as a system of international law and the ECT as a
treaty governed by international law, its relationship with the BIT is itself a matter
governed by the relevant rules of public international law. The Tribunal must,

therefore, ascertain the content of those rules.

It is clear that the BIT and the ECT are both treaties within the meaning of Article
2(1)(a) of the VCLT, so that their respective interpretation and interaction is potentially
governed by the provisions of the VCLT, and subsidiarily by any other applicable rule

of international law.

The same conclusion regarding the applicability of the VCLT was adopted by the
tribunal in the Eastern Sugar case, applying a BIT similar to the one at issue here:
The Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that in the absence of more specific legal
provisions, the effect of the Czech Republic accession to the European Union, a
regional multilateral treaty, on the BIT must be judged by the law of Nations, and
in particular the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties dated 1969.*”
The Tribunal’s conclusion, therefore, is that the VCLT is in principle applicable to the
relationship between the BIT and the ECT. The Tribunal will accordingly examine
whether the application of the VCLT is barred by the non-retroactivity provision in its

Article 4.

Whether the BIT was concluded before or after Slovakia became party to the VCLT

The starting point of the new argument presented by the Respondent in its Reply is the
principle stated in Article 4 of the VCLT, which provides that the Convention “applies
only to treaties which are concluded by States after the entry into force of the present
Convention with regard to such States.” The Respondent argues that “concluded” in
this provision means “ratified”, rather than “entered into force”; the Respondent then
argues that, because of the rules on State succession, the VCLT does not apply to the

situation dealt with by the Tribunal:

The Treaty was concluded on October 15, 1990 and entered into force in the
relations of Austria and Czechoslovakia on October 1, 1991. The Slovak Republic
emerged as a successor sovereign State on January 1, 1993. The applicability of
the Treaty by way of state succession was confirmed by an exchange of diplomatic
notes on 4 August and 25 November 1994, entering into force on January 1, 1995.

On the other hand, by way of a declaration of succession filed with the Secretary-
General of the United Nations on May 19, 1993, Slovakia is bound by the
provisions of the VCLT as of January 1, 1993. In light of Article 4 VCLT, this
would mean that the provisions of the Vienna Convention apply only to treaties
which are concluded by Slovakia and other States parties to the Convention after
January 1, 19932*

Although the Respondent’s precise argument is not entirely clear, it appears that the

latter must have relied on the date of the initial “conclusion” or initial ratification of the

BIT by Czechoslovakia in 1990 and not its entry into force for Slovakia in 1995.

The Tribunal does not need to address the question of whether a treaty can be said to be
concluded, within the meaning of this term in Article 4 of the VCLT, when it is ratified
or only when it enters into force, as both the exchange of diplomatic notes in the
framework of the process of State succession — which can be considered as equivalent
to a ratification by the successor State — and the entry into force of the BIT for
Slovakia, took place after Slovakia became bound by the VCLT. Indeed, once Slovakia
became an independent successor State, it could not be bound by the BIT,
notwithstanding the fact that its predecessor State had signed and ratified the BIT, until
it had taken the steps necessary to succeed to the BIT. Only once it had taken those
steps could it be regarded as having concluded the BIT. In the present case, Slovakia

did not take those steps until after it had become bound by the VCLT.

This conclusion is confirmed by information given by Austria in its submission, which
explains that, as regards the BIT an Exchange of Diplomatic Notes took place in 1994,
and the BIT entered into force between Austria and the Slovak Republic in 1995, after
the entry into force of the VCLT:

The Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak
Federative Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments was signed
on 15 October 1990 and entered into force on 1 October 1991 (...). Following the
dissolution of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, Austria and the newly
independent Slovakia jointly identified the BIT, among other treaties, to be in

force and applicable between them by means of an Exchange of Diplomatic Notes

(See Federal Law Gazette No. 1046/1994). Moreover, the Exchange of

Diplomatic Notes also amended the BIT, so as to insert the designations “Slovak

Republic” and “Slovak” into the text of the Agreement as appropriate.*”
In other words, the BIT would not have become applicable between Austria and the
Respondent had it not been for the Exchange of Notes. The Tribunal therefore
concludes that the BIT cannot be considered to have been concluded by the Respondent
until, at the earliest, the date of the Exchange of Notes in 1994. Since the VCLT
became applicable to Slovakia on 1 January 1993, it therefore applies to the relations
between the BIT and the ECT, the latter treaty having entered into force for Slovakia on
1 May 2004.

C. THE APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 59 OF THE VCLT

The Tribunal will now turn to the question whether the effect of Article 59(1) of the

VCLT is that the BIT was terminated upon the Slovak Republic’s accession to the EU.

1. The Positions of the Parties and the Amici Curiae

(1) The Respondent

83.

84.

According to the Respondent, there are three conditions for the application of Article
59 of the VCLT: (1) the parties to the earlier and later treaty must coincide; (2) the
treaties must relate to the same subject matter, and (3) either (i) the intention of the
contracting parties must have been to govern the subject matter of the treaties by the
later treaty, or (ii) there must be incompatibility between the provisions of the earlier
and the later treaty, which makes it impossible to apply both treaties simultaneously.””
The Respondent argues that the above requirements for the application of Article 59(1)
of the VCLT have been met in the case of the BIT and the ECT.

The Respondent submits that it is beyond dispute that the 2003 Treaty of Accession, by
which it became a Member State of the EU and a Party to the ECT, was concluded after

the conclusion of the BIT and that both Austria and the Respondent are States Parties to

the Treaty of Accession as well as the BIT.’

85. The Respondent argues that the BIT and the EC Treaty “relate to the same subject
matter.” The Respondent submits, consistent with the International Law Commission
Report on Fragmentation of International Law (hereinafter the “ILC Report”), that the
“criterion of sameness must be considered fulfilled if two different rules or sets of rules
are invoked in regard to the same factual situation.” Contrary to the findings of the
Eastern Sugar tribunal, and as the Eureko tribunal acknowledged, “[nJothing in Article
59 requires that the two treaties should be in all respects co-extensive; but the later
treaty must have more than a minor overlap or incidental overlap with the earlier
treaty.”“* The Respondent submits that “the fundamental purpose of both treaties is to
broaden and strengthen mutual economic relationships, to promote the flow of capital
and the economic development of the Parties, while guaranteeing the protection of

private parties involved in the process.”

The Respondent also advances several
specific ways in which the EC Treaty and the BIT relate to a common subject matter,
namely that the EC Treaty’s protection of an investment made in an EU Member State
extends to the “same circle of entities”, covers the same types of investments, offers the

same concrete protections, and provides comparable systems of remedies as the BIT.“

86. Relying on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (“Charter”) and
the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”), the Respondent
discusses four particular areas of substantive investment protection where it submits
that EU law provides for equivalent protection to that found in the BIT: expropriation,

fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, and free movement of

capital.’ According to the Respondent, this equivalent protection leads to the

conclusion that the ECT and the BIT relate to the same subject matter.

87. The Respondent asserts that the Eureko tribunal erroneously concluded that the
protection against expropriation under Article 5 of the Netherlands-Czech and Slovak
Federal Republic (“CSFR”) BIT was not coextensive with the right to property as
secured by EU law.** The Respondent refers to the case law of the ECJ which stresses

that the “right to property is guaranteed in the EU legal order.”

88. With respect to fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(1) of the BIT, the
Respondent submits that it only incorporates the minimum standard under customary
international law. According to the Respondent, the standard so defined mirrors the
protections provided under EU law which go “far beyond the principle of non-
discrimination.”*” The Respondent points to the ECJ’s determination that freedom of
establishment under EU law mandates that any obstacles, restrictions or hindrances to

the enjoyment of this freedom be removed.”

89. Regarding the overlap between EU law and the BIT concerning full protection and
security, the Respondent distinguishes the BIT in this case from the BIT at issue in the
Eureko award and notes that the present BIT does not impose an additional substantive
obligation of “full protection and security.”*’ The Respondent asserts that, in any event,
EU law provides an equivalent protection to the obligation to accord “full protection

9953

and security”*> which it argues only relates to the physical protection of foreign

investment.™*

90. The Respondent additionally argues that there is complete overlap between the free

transfer of payments guaranteed in Article 5 of the BIT and Article 56 of the EC Treaty,

which prohibits restrictions on the movement of capital and payments between EU

Member States.**

Furthermore, the Respondent stresses that EU law “does contain limitations on the right
of Member States to expropriate property” since Member States are obliged to respect
fundamental human rights when implementing EU law and EU law has a broad scope

of application.**

Finally, the Respondent argues that both the BIT and the EU have comparable systems
of remedies for investments impaired by State action, pointing to the various EU
mechanisms available to investors.*’ The “complete” remedial system established by
the EC Treaty is, according to the Respondent, “at least as favourable to investors” as
the arbitration mechanism established under Article 8 of the BIT, particularly in light of

the narrow scope of the latter.**

As to the last condition for the application of Article 59(1) of the VCLT, the
Respondent argues that, by virtue of the Slovak Republic’s accession to the EU, the
States Parties to the BIT manifested their intention to have the subject matter of the BIT

governed by EU law.*

The Respondent discusses the test for “intention”, pointing to Article 59(1)(a) of the
VCLT, which it argues concerns situations in which a treaty is “implicitly terminated”

even if the parties have not expressly provided for it.”

Relying on the ILC Commentary on the Law of Treaties for the proposition that the
intention of the parties is a “matter of construction of the two treaties”, the Respondent
concludes that, because of its later date, the Treaty of Accession is “key to determining,
in its terms and in the circumstances of its conclusion” the intention of the parties to the

BIT as to the BIT’s termination or continuation.*' The Respondent argues that “intent

may be discerned in the relative importance and scope of the two treaties,” and the fact

that the earlier treaty contains more specific rules is not preclusive of an implicit
termination.” Furthermore, the ILC Report provides that “the principle of /ex specialis
may be overridden by treaties of a more general character by virtue of their ‘relevance’

or ‘importance’.”

According to the Respondent, the Parties’ intent to supplant the BIT is demonstrated by
an overriding commitment to a pervasive internal market and common commercial
policy, with the corresponding removal of obstacles to the free movement of goods,

persons, services and capital.

The Respondent also stresses, as proof that bilateral
investment treaties are obsolete in the relations of the EU Member States inter se, that
“no BIT has been concluded between EU Member States after their accession into the

EU."

The Respondent claims that it has established far more than a minor or incidental

overlap between the BIT and the EC Treaty.

The Respondent argues that the incompatibility between the provisions of the ECT and
those of the BIT is such that the two treaties cannot be applied at the same time and that
therefore, pursuant to Article 59(1) of the VCLT, the BIT must have been terminated
by the Respondent’s accession to the ECT.‘’ The Respondent maintains that
incompatibility between the provisions of the BIT and EU law must be construed
broadly and is established on four grounds: (a) fundamental freedoms may be
incompatible with BIT protections; (b) measures by Member States that restrict
fundamental freedoms in conformity with EU law may breach BIT protections; (c)
competition and regulatory law essential for the functioning of the single European
market may conflict with BIT provisions and; (d) the BIT dispute settlement provision

infringes the exclusive jurisdiction of the ECJ to interpret EU law.

The Respondent discusses the test for “incompatibility”, relying on the ILC Report, to
argue that “incompatibility may arise ... when a treaty frustrates the goals of another
treaty without there being any incompatibility stricto sensu between their respective

provisions.”

The Respondent considers a wide range of EU regulatory provisions which restrict
compliance with the provisions of the BIT.” The Respondent submits two particular
categories of such EU regulatory provisions: (a) EU legal rules which would prevent a
BIT Party from honouring specific guarantees given to the investor,” and (b) EU legal
tules which generally and negatively alter the legal environment in which the investor
operates.” The Respondent therefore argues that the “application and enforcement” of
EU law could constitute a breach of obligations under the BIT, or that meeting

obligations under the BIT could result in a violation of EU law.”

The Respondent advances two arguments in support of its position that the investor-
state dispute settlement mechanism established in Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible
with EU law. First, the Respondent argues that Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible
with the ECT provisions on the exclusive jurisdiction of EU judicial institutions
pursuant to Article 292 EC Treaty, since the Tribunal may fail properly to take EU law
into account.” Secondly, the Respondent submits that the existence and applicability of
Article 8 of the BIT has already breached EC Treaty provisions on non-discrimination
under Article 12 of the EC Treaty since it creates preferential treatment not tolerated
under EU law by allowing Austrian investors to choose from different enforcement

options not available to other EU investors.”

Additionally, the Respondent highlights the proceedings (the EU Pilot case)
commenced by the European Commission (“EC”) against the Slovak Republic,

wherein the EC expressed serious concerns regarding the compatibility of the

Netherlands-Slovakia BIT with EU law, as another indication of the incompatibility of

the Treaty with EU law.”

103. The Respondent takes note of the Eureko tribunal’s findings that the uniformity of EU
law can be preserved in set aside proceedings in national court based on public policy,
pursuant to the ECJ’s Eco Swiss decision which qualified a violation of EU competition
law as a matter of public policy.” However, the Respondent argues that it is unclear
which rules of EU law apart from competition law enjoy the status of public policy, and
that the public policy provisions in the New York Convention and the Swedish
Arbitration Act (1999), respectively, are narrow in scope and would not provide a

safeguard for EU law issues that may arise under Article 8 of the BIT.”

104. Furthermore, the Respondent disputes the argument that the discrimination inherent in
the BIT due to its protections being available solely to Austrian or Slovak nationals can
be cured by extending the benefit of the BIT to all other EU investors. The Respondent
submits that the “extension doctrine” cannot be relied upon to “undo a breach that has
already occurred” and the fact that it only harms potential investors rather than the
Claimant is irrelevant since this discrimination establishes incompatibility with EU law,

which is relevant for the purposes of Article 59 VCLT.”

105. Lastly, the Respondent argues that Article 65 of the VCLT, which requires notification
in the case of termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty, does not apply to
Article 59 of the VCLT.”’ Instead, the Respondent asserts that, pursuant to Article 59,
“there is no explicit requirement under the law of treaties for notification in case of
termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty by the conclusion of a subsequent
treaty.”*! The Respondent argues that the premise underlying Article 59 of the VCLT is

to regulate cases where the conclusion of a later treaty is not clear evidence of the

parties’ consent to abrogate the earlier treaty.° The Respondent notes that State
practice supports the conclusion that termination pursuant to Article 59 of the VCLT is
not subject to the procedural requirements of Article 65 VCLT.*’ The Respondent
therefore criticises the Eureko tribunal’s finding that Article 59 VCLT is subject to

Article 65 VCLT procedural requirements, calling it a fundamental error.’

(2) The Claimant

106.

107.

The Claimant argues that the Tribunal should first look at the wording of the BIT itself,
instead of turning to extrinsic evidence.** The Claimant notes that the language of the
BIT indicates that the Contracting States foresaw and provided for the possibility that
they may enter into international obligations with one another and third parties in the
future, citing as evidence Articles 3(2) and 7 of the BIT.** Article 3(2) of the BIT
creates an exception to Most-Favoured Nation treatment for “present and future
privileges accorded by one Contracting Party to the investors of a third State or their
investments in connection with: (a) [a]Jn economic union, tariff union, common market,
free trade zone or economic community.”*’ The Claimant argues that these exceptions
fit perfectly with Austria’s and Slovakia’s accession to the EU.’ Article 7 of the BIT
stipulates that the BIT will remain in full force and effect unless a more favourable
regime takes precedence.*” Thus, the BIT already explicitly provides conflict rules for
the case where one or both parties to the BIT join a community such as the EU. In the
present case, since accession to the EU did not create a more favourable treatment for
investor-State disputes, the Claimant asserts that the BIT remains unaffected by

Slovakia’s accession to the EU.”

The Claimant argues that the preconditions for termination under Article 59 VCLT
have not been met. The Claimant submits that there was no intent that the “matter” of

the BIT should be governed by EU law since it was not addressed in connection with

Slovakia’s accession to the EU.”' Furthermore, the Claimant alleges that EU law and
the Treaty are not incompatible; the Treaty protects already existing investments
whereas EU law concentrates on the four freedoms which focus on the pre-
establishment phase.” In addition, the Claimant submits that insofar as the Treaty and

EU law regulate similar matters, they are parallel, but not contradictory.”*

Regarding the application of Article 59(1) of the VCLT, the Claimant argues that the
provision envisages two possible avenues for implicit termination: (i) the intention to
abrogate the earlier treaty appears from the terms of the later treaty or is otherwise
established or (ii) the provisions of the later treaty “are so far incompatible that they are

not capable of being applied at the same time.”

Regarding the first option, the Claimant states that “[n]owhere does the Accession
Treaty say that the Treaty is abrogated and nowhere does it say that the Accession
Treaty and EU law ‘govern the matter’ of bilateral investment treaty protection.”*> As
to the second option, the Claimant notes that the incompatibility between the two
treaties must be sufficient to demonstrate the intent to completely abrogate the earlier
treaty."° The Claimant argues that termination pursuant to Article 59 of the VCLT
requires the treaties to strictly relate to the same subject matter, and that EU law and the
BIT do not relate to the same subject matter.’ The Claimant asserts that “[t]o accede a
community is simply not the same as a specific investment protection regime providing

for investor-State arbitration.”

The Claimant further distinguishes the BIT and EU law: (i) EU law does not provide
for any guarantees relating to legal property regimes since the regulation of property is
controlled by Member States, (ii) the ECJ does not provide for the protection of
fundamental rights, (iii) the aim and purpose of the treaties are different, the BIT

dealing only with economic aims and the EU Treaty also addressing political aims, and

(iv) the ECJ is not a court set up to protect investors.” Pointing to the Eco Swiss case,
the Claimant argues that EU law does not prohibit arbitral tribunals from interpreting

EU law; instead, the two “concepts” work “in parallel.”'”

Contrary to any intention to terminate or suspend treaties, the Claimant points to Article
6(12) of the Act Concerning the Conditions of Accession attached to the Treaty of
Accession, which it argues, explicitly contemplates subsequent measures to adjust
rights and obligations under prior international agreements rather than their automatic

termination or suspension."

The Claimant maintains that the ECJ has ruled that EU Member States “may conclude
bilateral treaties between themselves.”"” The Claimant distinguishes the two ECJ
judgments on BITs which found that these infringed EU law, noting that these were
BITs concluded between EU Member States and third countries and are therefore not

relevant to the present case.'”

Finally, the Claimant points to actions of the Slovak
Republic that, according to the Claimant, demonstrate that the Respondent “did not
assume that intra-EU BITs would be ineffective”: (i) neither party denounced the BIT;
(ii) a letter from the Respondent stating that the health insurance laws would be in
accordance with BITs; (iii) assurances made by the Respondent to the Netherlands
regarding the validity of the Netherlands-CSFR BIT; (iv) the Respondent’s amendment
of its BIT with Romania in light of that country’s forthcoming accession to the EU
which did not alter the dispute resolution clause, and; (v) the inclusion of the Treaty on

the Slovak Republic’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs homepage listing all current BITs.'“

Turning to the case law, the Claimant emphasises that the Eureko tribunal found that
the preconditions for termination under Article 59 of the VCLT were not met since “the
EC Treaty does not relate to the same subject matter as the Netherlands-CSFR BIT."

Instead, the tribunal found that the protections available in the BIT were broader than

those available under EU law, although it accepted that there may be a certain
duplication of rights.'°° The Claimant also points to the Eureko tribunal’s findings that
(i) there is no rule in EU law that would prohibit investor-State arbitration, (ii)
transnational arbitration is commonplace within the EU, and (iii) the ECJ does not have

in “interpretative monopoly” on considering and applying EU law.'”

114. The Claimant also discusses Eastern Sugar, another case under the Netherlands-CSFR
BIT where the tribunal found that neither the Europe Agreement with the Czech
Republic'® nor the Treaty of Accession provided that the BIT was terminated, and that
the BIT and EU law “do not cover the same precise subject matter” so that Article 59 of
the VCLT does not apply.” Furthermore, the Eastern Sugar tribunal held that if the
BIT gives greater rights to the Netherlands and Dutch investors over other EU
investors, then “it will be for those other countries and investors to claim their equal

rights. The fact that these rights are unequal does not make them incompatible.”

115. The Claimant also submits that any termination under Article 59 of the VCLT must
follow the procedure laid out in Article 65 VCLT, requiring explicit termination by
notice of the grounds to the other Party and that no notice was provided by either State

Party to the BIT."

The EC does not base its submissions upon Article 59 VCLT, since the application of
that provision is a matter of public international law and the EC confines its arguments
to EU law. Nevertheless, the EC maintains that the Treaty deals with “subject matters
that fall squarely within the scope of the Treaty [on] the Functioning of the European
Union” (“TFEU”), specifically the rules on foreign investment activity including post-

establishment treatment and operation.''

The EC submits that the principle of non-
discrimination on grounds of nationality requires the same treatment of investors from
all EU Member States “as regards both substantive standards of protection and

procedural remedies.”''*

The EC notes that where arbitration claims involve questions of the “application and
interpretation of law covered by the EU treaties, EU law takes precedence. Where
there is a conflict with EU law, the general international law rule of ‘pacta sunt
servanda’ does not apply to treaties concluded between EU Member States.”"'® The EC
stresses that it is the domestic courts of Member States which must ensure the correct
application of EU law and guarantee procedural and substantive protection to private
parties for breaches of EU law, with oversight by the ECJ to determine whether the
Member States have fulfilled their obligation under EU law and to rule on questions of
EU law as requested by EU domestic courts.''’ The EC submits that the “right of
individuals to compensation from Member States for breaches of EU law is firmly
grounded in EU law and is a principle inherent in the system of EU law.”'"* The EC
also notes that in the TFEU, EU Member States agreed not to submit disputes involving
the application or interpretation of EU law to a method of dispute settlement other than

those set out in the EU treaties.'"”

The EC further alleges that an “international agreement cannot affect the allocation of
responsibilities defined in the European treaties, including the autonomy of the
European Union legal system and the exclusive jurisdiction of EU courts”, and notes

that a private party cannot rely on an international agreement to justify a possible

breach of EU law, nor can it rely on dispute settlement mechanisms that conflict with

the EU judicial system.

The EC concludes by drawing attention to Opinion 1/09 delivered by the ECJ on 8
March 2011, which found that a court, set up outside the institutional and judicial
framework of the European Union to resolve patent-related disputes between private
parties, was not compatible with the provisions of European Union treaties.'* The EC
relies on Opinion 1/09 to argue that “the investor-state arbitration mechanism set out in
the bilateral investment treaty on which the arbitral tribunal dealing with PCA Case No.
2010-17 was established is incompatible with the provisions of the European Union
treaties” since the Tribunal is outside the institutional and judicial framework of the
European Union, given that it cannot make references to the ECJ for issues relating to

The Czech Republic submits that the BITs it concluded with other EU Member States
are obsolete by virtue of its accession to the EU.'* The Czech Republic submits that
Articles 59(1) and 30(3) of the VCLT designate the later treaty as the point of reference
to assess incompatibility and the intent to terminate the earlier treaty.'* The Czech
Republic notes that there are Member States which consider that BITs can function in
parallel to the EC Treaties and that there are Member States, like itself, which consider
the overlap between the BIT provisions and EU law to be substantial and do not intend

that BITs between EU Member States should remain in effect.'*

The Czech Republic finds that the procedures of Article 65 of the VCLT do not apply
to Article 59 of the VCLT which is a special case of abrogation through the parties’
consent, as evidenced by its practice with Norway.’* The Czech Republic notes that

when it and Norway confirmed the validity of bilateral treaties concluded between the

123. The Czech Republic submits that the incompatibility of the BIT with EU law is

established to the extent that the Tribunal finds that the BIT and EU law relate to the
same subject matter.'** The Czech Republic also submits that the Tribunal should adopt
a broad view of “sameness” and incompatibility.” The Czech Republic observes that
the Eureko tribunal employed an unduly strict understanding of incompatibility when it
found that the permissibility of an act under EU law and its prohibition under the BIT

did not constitute incompatibility.'*°

124. The Czech Republic alleges that to the “extent that EU law and the [Treaty] indeed

relate to the same subject matter, the dispute settlement mechanism established in
Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with EU law.”"' The Czech Republic notes that
arbitral tribunals established under Article 8 of the BIT cannot request a preliminary
ruling by the ECJ on the interpretation of EU law under Article 234 of the EC Treaty,
and that Article 8 of the BIT may violate the principle of non-discrimination under

Article 12 of the EC Treaty.'”

125. The Republic of Austria submits that the BIT is still in force.'* It mentions that in a

exchange of views and not a formal notification.'*

In its reply on 20 May 2011,
Austria expressed its view that the BIT continues to be in force and indicated that it was
ready to enter into consultations under Article 9 of the BIT if so desired.'* Austria
observes that the issue of the /ex posterior rule of Article 59 of the VCLT has been
dealt with “in extenso by the Eastern Sugar and the Eureko tribunals” and that Austria

concurs with their findings, contending that none of the criteria of Article 59 of the

VCLT is met.'** Austria notes that the EU treaties and the BIT “have different
objectives and a different content” with the former aiming at establishing a monetary
and economic union in the wider context of a political union, while the latter is a

specific treaty aiming solely at the promotion and protection of investments.'*’

126. Austria also submits that the notification procedure in Article 65 of the VCLT is
applicable to any termination under Article 59 of the VCLT and notes that neither party
took any steps to terminate the BIT, contending that, even if the VCLT does not apply,
the principle that “one State cannot impose any rule unilaterally on another State
without the latter’s consent” as found in Article 65 of the VCLT, is a rule of customary

international law.
Article 59 of the VCLT, but points out that when it concluded a bilateral air transport
agreement with another State which overlapped almost article by article with a previous
treaty, it notified its view that the earlier agreement was to be considered terminated
and did not receive any objection, which it contends is a typical example of the

application of Article 59 of the VCLT.'”

127. Austria further observes that applying Article 59 of the VCLT would be inconsistent
with the legal effects of EU law since EU law in general does not abrogate
contradicting national law or treaties between Member States but rather “claims
prevailing application” which in terms of treaty law means referring to Article 30 of the
VCLT rather than to Article 59 of the VCLT.'° Indeed, Austria asserts that “[a]ir
transport agreements or agreements with neighbouring States on facilitated border-
crossings are typical categories of further treaties affected by EU law” and that as far as
Austria is concerned, it does not consider these treaties to have been terminated under
Article 59 of the VCLT."*' Austria notes that it only decided to consider an agreement

terminated in “one exceptional case” which involved an agreement that regulated visa

requirements since it was clearly evident that EU law “covered exactly the same

subject-matter in its totality.”'*

128. Austria submits that since the BIT continues to be in force, the relationship between EU
law and the BIT is to be determined in accordance with Article 30 of the VCLT,
confined to assessing the incompatibility of Article 8 which is the only relevant
provision at the jurisdictional phase.'*? Austria distinguishes Opinion 1/09 of the ECJ
on the creation of a unified patent litigation system since the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
in the present case is not exclusive, but optional and dependent on the consent of the
parties to the dispute.‘ The ECJ has already determined that arbitral tribunals are not

incompatible with the EU legal order.'**

Austria argues that, since it is possible to
integrate the Tribunal’s award into the EU legal system at the enforcement stage,
Article 8 of the BIT is not incompatible with the institutional and jurisdictional

framework of the EU.'*®

129. Austria further contests the argument that allowing for arbitration discriminates against
other EU nationals, arguing by analogy from the bilateral double taxation treaties. The
ECJ held that Member States could conclude bilateral double taxation agreements in
the absence of EU measures involving all Member States, despite the fact that these
reciprocal rights and obligations would only apply to residents of two contracting

Member States since this was an inherent consequence of such conventions.'””

(4) The Parties’ Responses to the Amici Curiae

previous submissions address the shortcomings in the reasoning of those awards.'”

131. The Respondent disputes Austria’s observation that, for the purposes of Article 59 of
the VCLT, the EU Treaties and the BIT “do not ‘relate to the same subject matter’
because the EU Treaties also contain ‘substantial non-economic objectives’.”'*’ The
Respondent alleges that “nothing in Article 59 implies a requirement of co-
extensiveness of purpose” and that the later treaty may serve “other, additional, objects
and purposes” without excluding the operation of Article 59 of the VCLT.'
Furthermore, the Respondent contends that the objective of the EU Treaties is primarily
and most importantly to “establish a Common Market.” In any event, the Respondent
notes that the policy objectives of treaties are not relevant when looking at whether the
two treaties “relate to the same subject matter” for the purposes of Article 59(1)
VCLT.'* Rather, as the Czech Republic also submitted in its observation, “the criterion
of ‘same subject matter’ should be considered fulfilled if two different rules or sets of

tules are invoked in regard to the same factual situation.”'™*

132. The Respondent further takes issue with Austria’s insistence that there is no right to
initiate international arbitration under EU law, since the question to be analysed is
whether EU law offers effective means for the assertion of claims and the enforcement

of rights.'*°

133. The Respondent disputes Austria’s submission that termination under Article 59 VCLT
requires notification in accordance with Article 65 VCLT and that in any event the
requirement of formal notification under Article 65 VCLT has been met by the Slovak

Republic’s diplomatic note of 5 May 2011.'** According to the Respondent, rather than

being an “‘informal’ indication of interest in ‘exploring avenues to terminate the

Agreement’ ... the Slovak Republic expressly notified Austria of its view that ‘upon

accession of the Slovak Republic to the European Union, our BITs entered into with
other EU Member States must be considered as terminated by virtue of Article 59
VCLT, or at the very least inapplicable by virtue of Article 30(3) VCLT’, asking at the
same time Austria to ‘outline its willingness to terminate mutually the BIT’ for the sake

of legal certainty.”'*”

The Respondent concedes the validity of Austria’s observation that “applying Article
59 [VCLT] would be inconsistent with the legal effect of EU law” since EU law does
not abrogate earlier treaties but rather claims prevailing application, yet asserts that the
“implicit termination of conflicting treaty obligations among Member States is not an
unprecedented phenomenon in the EU legal order”, noting Austria’s reference to the
agreement with the Slovak Republic on the abolishment of visa requirements, which

was terminated in accordance with Article 59 VCLT by virtue of EU law.'*

The Respondent takes issue with Austria’s observation that incompatibility requires
that “two provisions cannot be applied at the same time in the sense that applying one

necessarily entails the violation of the other.”

The Respondent asserts that this
position has been refuted by the “work of the ILC and academic authority, which
consider incompatibility to exist also where a treaty provision frustrates the goals of
another treaty provision relating to the same subject matter without there being any

incompatibility stricto sensu between the two provisions.”

The Respondent disputes Austria’s attempt to distinguish the relevance of Opinion 1/09
which dealt with setting up a patent court, submitting that the view that international
arbitration is optional and therefore unlike the exclusive jurisdiction of the patent court,
goes against its “previous statement on the investor’s right to initiate international
arbitration proceedings being ‘an essential characteristic of the BIT, which cannot be

found in EU law’.”"*!

The Respondent further takes issue with Austria’s reliance on the ECJ decisions of

Nordsee and Eco Swiss for the proposition that the Tribunal’s awards can be integrated

into the EU legal system so that Article 8 of the BIT is not incompatible with Article
267 TFEU.'* The Respondent submits that “[t]hese cases concerned arbitration
agreements entered into by private entities” which, contra to Member States, are not

responsible for ensuring that EU law obligations are complied with.'*

The Respondent also disputes Austria’s observation that the discriminatory effects of
Article 8 of the BIT is an “inherent consequence” of the BIT and should be tolerated
under EU law in the same way that reciprocal rights and obligations under bilateral
conventions for the avoidance of double taxation are tolerated under EU law.'* The
discriminatory effects of the BIT “cannot be properly considered an ‘inherent

v165

consequence’ of the Treaty.

Finally, the Respondent takes issue with Austria’s observation that the discriminatory
effects of the nationality requirement in the BIT can easily be remedied since any
national of an EU Member State can organise their investments in a way that would
allow them to satisfy the nationality requirement.’ The Respondent takes this point as
evidence of the “anomaly” of the continued existence of BITs within the EU internal

market.'”

The Claimant focuses its comments on the observations of the EC and those of the

Czech Republic.

The Claimant submits that the EC’s contention that investor-State arbitration is outside

168

the legal and judicial order of the EU is wrong.'* Furthermore, the Claimant argues
“that EU law contains no standards of protection for private investors that would even

only remotely be comparable to those under the Treaty” and that “the recognition of

arbitration in the legal and judicial system of the EU is an expression of the mutual trust

by EU Member States in the administration of justice.”"”

The Claimant notes that, while the EC describes its observations as a summary of the
position it took in Eureko, the position the EC took in Eureko, as well as in Eastern
Sugar, was actually that “intra-EU BITs are not automatically terminated by virtue of
EU accession” and that “to terminate these BITs, EU Member States would have to

strictly follow the relevant procedure provided in the BITs.”"”

The Claimant disputes the EC’s observation that the investor-State arbitration
mechanism is incompatible with the EU legal and judicial order, noting that this is

contrary to the Eco Swiss judgment.'”!

The Claimant takes issue with the relevance of Opinion 1/09 concerning the
establishment of a patents court with exclusive jurisdiction, which was cited both by the
EC and the Czech Republic.'” The Claimant distinguishes the proposed court from
international investment arbitration since that court had the power to “examine the

validity of an act of the European Union.”

The Claimant notes that every EU Member State has its own arbitration laws and is a
member of the New York Convention, which implicitly recognises that disputes “which
may potentially involve rules of EU law may be settled by arbitration to the exclusion
of national courts” and that were the EC’s observation correct, “it could be argued that
each and every EU Member State would be infringing EU law by allowing for

arbitration and obliging itself to enforce foreign arbitral awards.”!™

The Claimant also disputes the reliance, by the EC and the Czech Republic in their
observations, on Article 292 of the EC Treaty in support of the view that Article 8 of
the BIT conflicts with the exclusive jurisdiction of the ECJ. Rather, the Claimant posits
that “Article 292 of the EC Treaty (Article 344 TFEU) deals with disputes concerning

the interpretation or application of the Treaties between Member States” which are
“extremely rare” and which has no application for arbitrations such as the one at hand

which is not between two EU Member States.'”

147. The Claimant questions the EC’s reference to the basic principle of mutual trust by EU
Member States in the application of EU law and in the administration of justice,
submitting that the EC “does not attempt to elaborate what purpose ... is served by

o176

reference to that principle. If the EC’s purpose is to indicate that it considers

submitting disputes to arbitration to be an expression of distrust in the domestic courts

of the EU, then the Claimant points to Council Regulation (EC) No. 44/2001 on

Jurisdiction and the Recognition and Enforcement of Judgements in Civil and

Commercial Matters (“Brussels 1”) which excludes arbitration from its ambit, “thereby

expressly (by exclusion) recognizing and accepting arbitration on the level of EU

law.”'”

148. The Claimant highlights that the relevant question is not whether the dispute settlement
mechanism of Article 8 of the Treaty is outside the EU legal and judicial order (which
the Claimant maintains it is not), but rather “if and to which extent the arbitrators may
or may have to apply relevant EU law, whether that relevant EU law constitutes ‘public
policy’ and to which extent, if any, the Swedish courts may review an award in the light

of EU law when seized with a relevant application.”'”*

149. The Claimant takes issue with the EC’s view that arbitrators are not obliged to respect

EU law, asserting that arbitrators do have to apply the applicable law to the case that

may include elements of EU law, and which cannot simply be disregarded.'”

150. The Claimant submits that the Czech Republic’s observations on the status of intra-EU
BITs by virtue of EU accession are a non sequitur.'*’ The Claimant alleges that the

Czech Republic adduces no evidence of consent as required by Article 54 VCLT and

that the Protocol between the Czech Republic and Norway is not evidence of State

practice.'*!

151. The Claimant further takes issue with the Czech Republic’s observation regarding the
Treaty having been rendered inapplicable under Article 30 VCLT, to the extent that the
Treaty and EU law relate to the same subject-matter and are thus incompatible. The
Claimant highlights that “[t]here is not only no identity, there is also no

s7182

incompatibility. The Claimant asserts that the Czech Republic’s definition of
“sameness of subject matter” is circular since it involves looking at whether the two
different rules are invoked in regard to the “same matter.” The Claimant argues,
agreeing with Austria’s submission, that “despite some overlaps between provisions of
EU law and BITs, the two are parallel systems with their own scope of protection and

offering their own remedies.”"*

152. The Claimant also disputes the Czech Republic’s observation on “incompatibility” of
the Treaty with EU law, noting that the Czech Republic uses a broad understanding of
incompatibility." The Claimant asserts that the guarantees in the Treaty and the
fundamental freedoms of the EU do not point in different directions but rather “exist

side by side and ‘point’ into the same direction.”"**

153. The Claimant further takes issue with the Czech Republic’s observation that Article 8
of the Treaty violates the EU principle of non-discrimination which is another
circumstance of the Treaty’s incompatibility with EU law.'*’ The Claimant argues that
investor-state arbitration cannot be regarded as “outsourcing” as described by the EC
and submits that extending the availability of arbitration to all EU investors “leads to a

situation where there is no potential breach of EU law.”

154. Finally, the Claimant agrees with the Czech Republic in its conclusion that the Treaty

has not been terminated under Article 59(1)(a) VCLT, since the treaties themselves are
silent on the issue and no intent has been manifested to terminate the Treaty.'*” The
Claimant refers to a decision by the Municipal Court of Prague on the challenge of an
award on jurisdiction in Binder v. the Czech Republic which held that the Czech-
German BIT was “valid and effective.”'"” The Claimant further notes that the Czech
Republic still considers that the BIT between it and Austria is in effect as it is listed as
such on the homepage of the Czech Ministry of Finance and that while it has
renegotiated certain BITs, it has left the investor-State mechanism untouched.'*' Thus
the “conduct of the Czech Republic indicates that it did not maintain its view that its
intra-EU BITs were automatically terminated”, noting that in 2009, the Czech Republic
requested that various other EU Member States agree to terminate their bilateral treaties

with the Czech Republic.'”

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

155. The Tribunal considers it worth noting that, for Article 59 of the VCLT to apply, two

189
190

conditions have to be met:

(a) the first treaty (here the BIT) and the second treaty (here the ECT) must relate to the
same subject matter; and

(b) if this condition is fulfilled then, the ratification of the second treaty will terminate the
first treaty if either:

(1) the two States must be taken to have intended that the second treaty should
supersede the first treaty (the subjective condition); or

(2) the provisions of the first treaty must be so far incompatible with the provisions

of the second treaty that the two are not capable of being applied at the same time
(the objective condition).

The Tribunal will analyse whether each of these conditions is satisfied.

(1) Do the ECT and the BIT relate to “the same subject matter”?

(a) What is the test for determining that the two treaties have the “same subject matter”?

156. Professor Vierdag, relied upon by the Respondent, comments that “the requirement that

the instruments must relate to the same subject-matter seems to raise extremely difficult

99193

problems in theory, but may turn out not to be so very difficult in practice.

157. The Tribunal is not convinced that this requirement is easy in practice, but certainly

agrees that it is a difficult theoretical question.

158. The Respondent supports an extensive interpretation of this requirement, invoking the

International Law Commission Report on Fragmentation of International Law.'™

According to the approach of the ILC,

The criterion of “same subject-matter” seems already fulfilled if two different rules
or sets of rules are invoked in regard to the same matter, or if, in other words, as a
result of interpretation, the relevant treaties seem to point to different directions in
their application by a party.’

...the test of whether two treaties deal with the “same subject matter” is resolved
through the assessment of whether the fulfilment of the obligation under one treaty
affects the fulfilment of the obligation of another. This “affecting” might then take
place either as strictly preventing the fulfilment of the other obligation or
undermining its object and purpose in one or another way.’

159. According to the Respondent, this means that the “criterion of sameness must be

considered fulfilled if two different rules or sets of rules are invoked in regard to the

9197

same factual situation. Under this expansive approach, this would mean that two

rules have the same subject matter if they apply to the same facts.

160. The Claimant mainly relied, in its Counter Memorial, on the findings of the Eastern
Sugar and Eureko tribunals stating that the EC Treaty does not relate to the same

subject matter as the relevant BITs, without attempting to elaborate on the theoretical

meaning of the “same subject matter.” A more abstract approach was adopted in the
Rejoinder, in other words giving mainly a negative definition of when it cannot be
considered that two rules have the same subject matter but without attempting to
provide a more positive definition:

An ordinary meaning of what is to be understood to be the “same” should be the

basis for an understanding the phrase (sic) “the same subject matter”. Usually,

“same” does not mean that two things are merely comparable or, when it comes to
different sets of laws, simply deal with issues arising from the same facts.'**

161. In other words, the Claimant refutes the analysis of the Respondent and seems to adopt

a more restrictive interpretation, although it relies “on the ordinary meaning”,
considering that it is not enough that two rules apply to the same facts for those rules to
have the same subject matter. But no further indication is provided on characterising a

situation where two treaties have the same subject matter.

162. Before the Eureko tribunal, the Respondent argued that the BIT and the ECT relate to

the same subject matter, because they cover the same types of investors (i.e. natural
persons and legal entities) and investments, serve the same purposes (i.e. to broaden
and strengthen the economic relations), offer the same standards of protection relating
to the establishment of investments (i.e. equal treatment and non-discrimination, free
movement of capital, protection of proprietary rights) and provide for equivalent

remedies:

Under EU law, investors pursue their claims before national courts with
involvement of the ECJ via a preliminary ruling procedure; and under the BIT
investors can have their dispute heard before an arbitral tribunal. Both
mechanisms aim at the same objective, namely the protection of investments.
Under both mechanisms, investors may seek compensation for damages from
States for unlawful conduct ... '”

163. Here the emphasis is somewhat different, in that it is mainly stated that two rules have

the same subject matter if they have the same goal.

164. Little can be found on this issue in the Eastern Sugar case, where the tribunal was

198
199

content to state, without further conceptual definition, that “the two regulations do not

cover the same precise subject-matter.” The Binder tribunal did not even raise the

issue.

After a review of the different elements of analysis that have been advanced in order to
interpret the expression “same subject matter”, the question remains: how should “same

subject matter” be understood?

It is the Tribunal’s view that the terms of the VCLT are to be interpreted in good faith,
in accordance with their ordinary meaning in their context and in light of the object and
purpose of the VCLT. There is, therefore, no presumption in favour of either a broad or
a narrow interpretation. The necessity of a balanced interpretation in good faith has
already been emphasised in various decisions of arbitral tribunals, such as in the AMCO
decision:

... a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively, nor, as a matter of

fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way which leads to find out and

to respect the common will of the parties ... Moreover, ... any convention,

including conventions to arbitrate, should be construed in good faith, that is to say

by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the parties may be
considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged.””'

The same principle was adopted in the E/ Paso tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction:

This Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed, taking into
account both State sovereignty and the State’s responsibility to create an adapted
and evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities, and the
necessity to protect foreign investment and its continuing flow.””
In performing a good faith interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the expression
“same subject matter”, the Tribunal first adopts a_ negative approach and rejects the
interpretation according to which the “same subject matter” can be equated to being

applicable to “the same facts,” or having “the same goal.”

First, the Tribunal notes that the wording of Article 59 of the VCLT is not that the two

treaties must apply to the same facts or same situations but that they must deal with the

same subject matter. Even if two different rules deal with issues arising from the same
facts, it does not necessarily mean that they have the same subject matter. This can be
seen from a simple example: a treaty on environmental protection and a treaty on trade

may both apply to the same factual situation but the subject matter with which they deal

is quite different.

170. Secondly, the Tribunal notes that the wording of Article 59 of the VCLT does not

support the argument that it is sufficient for two treaties to have the same goal for them
to have the same subject matter. For example, two treaties can each have the goal of
enhancing the well-being of children, one in providing for an international mechanism
of monitoring of child labour, another in deciding that children under fourteen may not
be married against their will. Yet no reasonable person would consider that those two
treaties, although pursuing the same goal, the same overall purpose, have the same

subject matter.

171. The subject matter of a treaty, in the Tribunal’s understanding, therefore differs both

from the concrete situations in which it will be applicable and from its goal.

Accordingly, the Tribunal regards as irrelevant the Respondent’s statement that

It cannot be seriously disputed that investment protection, the subject matter of the
Treaty, is an important means for attaining the objective of a common market
under the EC Treaty “characterised by the abolition, between Member States, of
obstacles to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.”””

172. It is moreover the view of the Tribunal, which adopts next a positive approach, that the

subject matter of a treaty is inherent in the treaty itself and refers to the issues with
which its provisions deal, i.e. its topic or its substance. The Tribunal will therefore
focus on that question when determining whether or not the BIT and the ECT have the

same subject matter.

173. An important remark has to be made here by the Tribunal. In its view, the question at

203

issue has invariably been obscured by frequent confusion or conflation between
sameness and incompatibility. Even the ILC is not free from such error as can be seen

when reading the definition of the criterion of “sameness”:

Respondent’s Reply on Jurisdiction, 4103.

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction
22 October 2012

Page 58 of 160

The criterion of “same subject-matter” seems already fulfilled if two different rules or
sets of rules are invoked in regard to the same matter, or if, in other words, as a result
of interpretation, the relevant treaties seem to point to different directions in their
application by a party.

174. The Respondent seems to be aware, in theory, of the necessity to distinguish the two
aspects, when it opines that “the concept of ‘same subject matter’ should be understood
separately from the other requirements of Article 59 of the Vienna Convention”, one
of which is incompatibility. However in its concrete analysis, the Respondent conflates

the two requirements.

175. The Tribunal considers that Article 59 of the VCLT requires a two-step inquiry. First,
do the two treaties “relate to the same subject matter”? Secondly, do the rules in those
treaties point in the same direction or in different directions, to use the terminology of
the ILC? If the answer to the second question is that the two sets of rules point in the
same direction, the two treaties can easily coexist and be interpreted in harmony; if the
answer is that they point in different directions and the different directions imply a true
incompatibility, the latter treaty prevails. However, that second question arises only if

the first question has been answered in the affirmative.

(b) Application of the test to the facts of the present case

176. The Respondent considers that the two treaties have the same subject matter, since they
both regulate investment and investor rights and encompass comparable substantive
and procedural standards. For example, Slovakia argued during the oral hearing that
“EU law and the BIT regulate their common subject matter in substantially similar

99206

ways, which far exceeds minor or incidental overlap. The EC, in its submission,

also stated that “[t]he bilateral investment treaty...deals with subject matters that fall

99207

squarely within the scope of the Treaty of the Functioning of the European Union.

177. The Claimant, on the contrary, considers that the two treaties do not have the same
subject matter. The Claimant’s position was summarized during the oral hearing in the

following way:

The EU liberalization guarantee (market access) focus on pre-establishment phase

Treaty gives no automatic right of access (only in accordance with “[iJts
[Slovakia’s] laws”; focus on post-establishment phase ***

178. The Tribunal, after thorough analysis, has come to the conclusion that the two treaties
do not have the same overall subject matter. When asking “with what issues do the
tules of the two treaties deal?” it is evident that the treaties do not deal with the same
issues. The ECT deals with the creation of an internal market,” the BIT with the

fostering of international flows of investment by protecting the rights of the investors.

179. The Eastern Sugar tribunal, looking at the “precise” subject matter of the ECT and the
BIT determined that “[t]he European Union guarantees the free movement of
capital”, while “[b]y contrast, the BIT provides for fair and equitable treatment of the
investor during the investor’s investment in the host country.... the BIT also provides

221

for a special procedural protection’””"', adding:

From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the
arbitration clause is in practice the most essential provision of Bilateral Investment
Treaties. ... EU law does not provide such a guarantee.**

180. In other words, the Eastern Sugar tribunal arrived at the conclusion that the two treaties
did not have the same subject matter, relying mainly on two features. First, the two
treaties had a generally different approach, the ECT being more focused on the pre-
establishment period, and the BIT on the post-establishment period. Secondly, a
specific element linked with the remedies open to an investor when it considers that its
rights have been infringed is dealt with differently by the two treaties, since only the

BIT offers the investor access to international arbitration.

181. The Eureko tribunal also acknowledged, that “[nJothing in Article 59 requires that the

two treaties should be in all respects co-extensive; but the later treaty must have more

than a minor overlap or incidental overlap with the earlier treaty.””!*

Although employing different analyses, these two tribunals arrived at the same

conclusion as this Tribunal.

The Tribunal wishes to add that it cannot be denied that the subject matter of the BIT is
foreign investment. It is also well-known that, until the Lisbon Treaty, foreign direct
investment was not one of the competences of the EU. This would almost suffice to
conclude that the two treaties, the Austria-Slovakia BIT and the ECT do not have the
same subject matter. If the European Union had no jurisdiction to deal with direct
investment, it would be difficult to argue that the EU Treaties have the same subject
matter — direct investment — as the BITs, of which direct investment is one of the

subject matters.

The Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the EU Treaties and the EU law rooted in,
and flowing from them do not relate to the same subject matter as BITs or multilateral
treaties for the protection of foreign investment. To accede to an economic community
is simply not the same as to set up a specific investment protection regime providing for

investor-State arbitration.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the two treaties do not have the same subject
matter. It follows that the BIT has not been terminated by virtue of the application of
Article 59 VCLT.

(2) Did the Parties to the BIT manifest an intention to terminate that Treaty or are the BIT
and the ECT incapable of being applied at the same time?

186.

The Tribunal’s conclusion that the BIT and the ECT do not relate to the same subject
matter is determinative of the Article 59 of the VCLT argument. However, even if the
Tribunal had reached a different conclusion on that point, it would nevertheless have
found that the other requirements of Article 59 of the VCLT were not met. It will be
recalled that Article 59 of the VCLT provides that where the parties to a treaty conclude
a later treaty relating to the same subject matter, the earlier treaty is terminated only if
either (a) it appears from the later treaty, or is otherwise established, that the parties
intended to terminate the earlier treaty (the subjective test) or (b) the provisions of the
later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier treaty that the two are not

capable of being applied at the same time (the objective test). The Tribunal considers

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction
22 October 2012

Page 61 of 160

that, in the present case, neither test is met. It will briefly set out its reasons for that

conclusion.

(a) The subjective test

187.

188.

189.

190.

191.

192.

The question here is whether the States Parties to the BIT manifested in one way or

another a clear common intention to terminate the BIT?

The Respondent infers such an intention from the mere existence of the ECT.
According to the Respondent, “the very magnitude, scope and fundamentality of the
obligations undertaken in the second treaty can evidence the States Parties’ necessary

old

intent to supersede and replace an earlier treaty addressing the same subject matter.

The Claimant considers that “the intention of the Slovak Republic and the Republic of
Austria to terminate or suspend the Treaty is not manifested at all. The Accession
Treaty — whether by its nature or words — does clearly not provide for any

vos

manifestations of such intention.

The Claimant also refers to the EU Commission’s submission in the Eureko case, *"* on

which it commented:

In its observations submitted to the Tribunal, the EU Commission itself did not
discern any intention of the parties to abrogate earlier intra-EU BITs in the 2003
Act of Accession and stated that the intra-EU BITs have not been implicitly
terminated or suspended pursuant to Article 59 VCLT following the Slovak
Republic’s accession to the EU.""”

The Tribunal is not convinced by the Respondent’s argument that, by its very nature,
the ECT demonstrated an implied intent to terminate the BITs between Members and

non-Members of the EU that were transformed into intra-EU BITs by the accession of

Slovakia to the EU.

The Tribunal considers that nothing in the EU Treaties gives such an indication of

intent, rather to the contrary. As rightly emphasised by the Claimant, “[n]owhere does

the Accession Treaty say that ... [the] Accession Treaty and EU law ‘govern the
matter’ of bilateral investment treaty protection with its protection standards and
enforcement mechanisms. The Accession Treaty and the European Treaties do also not
say anything about investment protection for investors of one EU Member State in

another Member State.””!*

193. On the contrary, the Europe Agreement which entered into force one month after the
BIT, includes certain articles that would rather indicate that all rights belonging to
economic operators should be preserved until equivalent rights are granted in the
framework of the EU:

ARTICLE 74
INVESTMENT PROMOTION AND PROTECTION

1. Co-operation shall aim to establish a favourable climate for private investment,
both domestic and foreign, which is essential to economic and _ industrial
reconstruction in the Slovak Republic.

2. The particular aims of co-operation shall be:
- to improve the institutional framework for investments in the Slovak Republic;

- the extension by the Member States and the Slovak Republic of agreements for
the promotion and protection of investment;

ARTICLE 118

This Agreement shall not, until equivalent rights for individuals and economic
operators have been achieved under this Agreement, affect rights assured to them
through existing agreements binding one or more Member States, on the one hand,
and the Slovak Republic, on the other.

194. It is difficult for the Tribunal to consider that the express aim of the Europe Agreement
of an “extension by the Member States and the Slovak Republic of agreements for the
promotion and protection of investment” could be considered as an implied intent to
terminate them. Moreover, although the Europe Agreement does not deal expressly
with the termination of the BITs, it appears, in the view of the Tribunal, that it implies
that unless rights equivalent to those from which they benefitted under BITs before

accession to the EU were conferred upon investors by the EU law, such rights should

be maintained. This leans rather in the direction of maintaining the BIT since it is quite
difficult to deny that, under the EU framework, the foreign investors do not have, for
example, the direct right to bring international arbitration proceedings against the State

in which they have invested, a right which is a central feature of the BIT.

Neither can the BIT be interpreted as embodying a common intention that it will be
terminated if more favourable treatment is accorded to investors under a later treaty.

Article 7(1) of the BIT reads

If under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties or under international
obligations now or in the future undertaken between the Contracting Parties in
addition to this Agreement there exists a general or special regime whereby the
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party are accorded more
favourable treatment than under this Agreement, the said regime shall take
precedence over the present Agreement to the extent that it is more favourable.

It is clear that what the two States Parties had in mind was that future treaties between

them would complement the States Parties’ rights and obligations, and not that such

treaties would replace provisions in the BIT.

The Tribunal concludes that it cannot find an implied intention in the treaties adopted in

view of the accession to the EU, or in the ECT, to terminate the BIT.

Nor is the Tribunal persuaded that there is evidence extrinsic to the treaties which
manifests such a shared intention. It is common ground between the Parties that even if
some express manifestation of a wish to terminate the BIT has been performed by
Slovakia, this has not been followed by a common decision of the States Parties to

terminate the BIT.

The BIT includes some rules for its termination, which have not been utilised by the

Parties:

Article 11
Entry into Force and Term

(1) This Agreement is subject to ratification and shall enter into force on the first
day of the third month that follows the month during which the instruments of
ratification have been exchanged.

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction
22 October 2012

Page 64 of 160

(2) The Agreement shall remain in force for ten years; upon the expiry of that
period, it shall be extended for an indefinite period of time and may be denounced
by either Contracting Party subject to twelve months' prior notice in writing
through the diplomatic channel.

(3) In the case of investments that will have been made before the date of
denunciation of this Agreement, articles | to 10 of this Agreement shall apply for a
further ten years from that date.”"”

200. The BIT entered into force on 1 January 1995. There has been no mutual termination

of the BIT, nor an express denunciation by either State Party to the BIT.

201. It has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal that upon accession to the EU, the
Slovak Republic had sent a note requesting its BIT partners that were EU Member
States to accept a mutual termination. This document sent by the Ministry of Finance
of the Slovak Republic to “all Member States concerned”, had as its subject heading:
“Request for statement — possible termination of Bilateral Investment Treaties
concluded between the EU Member States” (emphasis added), and stated: “... we
would like to kindly ask you to outline your Government’s willingness to terminate
mutually the BITs that you have concluded with the Slovak Republic” (emphasis
added).””"

202. However, no mention has been made by either Party that a mutual agreement was
reached between Austria and Slovakia in order to agree to the termination of their BIT.
In fact, the Slovak Republic,” as well as Austria list their common BIT as one of the
international treaties to which they are a Party. The Tribunal recalls here that the

Eastern Sugar tribunal held that implicit termination could not be found in

219 The Respondent's certified translation from the Czech original (RL-40A).

20 Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic, Request for Statement — Possible Termination of Bilateral
Investment Treaties Concluded between the EU Member States, 5 May 2011 (RL-435) (emphasis added).

2! See for example, Claimant’s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, 4108: “The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
the Slovak Republic maintains on its [website’s] home page [C-13], a list of all existing BITs, and the
Austria/Slovakia BIT is among those listed.” At the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the Chairman asked the
Respondent whether it was “the case that, as [counsel for the Claimant] said yesterday, the BIT nevertheless
remains on the Slovakian Government's website as a treaty in force?” to which counsel for the Respondent
replied that it had “no reason to doubt that representation. I have not checked it myself. We do not think that
that is a significant fact, however. We note the Eureko tribunal also discounted these argments” Transcript
(Hearing on Jurisdiction), Day 2, 20 December 2011, p. 22:17-25.

circumstances where both Contracting Parties to the BIT still list the BIT as an

international treaty to which they are party.”

203. In the Tribunal’s understanding, a request for a mutual termination which can be

considered as a manifestation of a unilateral intention or desire to terminate the treaty
plainly indicates that the Party making such request did not consider that a mutual
intention already existed, either as something implicit in the text of the treaty or

something which could be inferred from the behaviour of the Parties.

204. No notice of termination has been given either by the Slovak Republic or by Austria.

This is confirmed in unambiguous terms by the Respondent, when it states that “[t]here
is no suggestion by the Slovak Republic in these proceedings that the BIT would be

99223,

terminated in accordance with Article 11(2) of the Treaty.

205. It can also be noted that Austria has reiterated, during the course of this proceeding, its

position to the effect that it considers the BIT in force. Ina letter dated 18 May 2011 to
Euram Bank’s counsel, the Austrian Federal Ministry for European and International

Affairs, in reply to certain questions, stated the following:

“(a) Does the Republic of Austria consider the Treaty still to be in force?

By means of an Exchange of Diplomatic Notes between the Republic of Austria
and the Slovak Republic on the continued application of certain Austro-
Czechoslovakian Treaties, the Agreement between the Republic of Austria and the
Czech and Slovak Federative Republic on the Promotion and Protection of
Investments of 15 October 1990 was jointly identified as remaining in force and
being applicable between the parties. Moreover, the Exchange of Diplomatic
Notes also amended the Agreement, so as to insert the designations “Slovak
Republic” and “Slovak” into the text of the Agreement as appropriate.°™*

206. The EU Commission itself has admitted that no BIT has been automatically terminated,

222

223
224

since it has asked the States to terminate them, for its own policy reasons:

Eventually, all intra-EU BITS will have to be terminated. Commission services
intend to contact all Member States again, urging them to take concrete steps soon.
Furthermore, while the Commission is in favour of consensual solutions with EU

Member States, as guardian of the EU treaties it cannot exclude eventually having
to resort to infringement proceedings against certain Member States.”°*

207. It might also be apposite to cite here an excerpt of the European Commission’s letter

dated 13 January 2006 which was quoted in the Eastern Sugar partial award:

The Commission therefore takes the view that the intra-EU BITs should be
terminated in so far as the matters under the agreements fall under Community
competence.

However, the effective prevalence of the EU acquis does not entail at the same
time the automatic termination of the concerned BITs or necessarily the non-
application of all their provisions.

Without prejudice to the primacy of Community law, to terminate these
agreements Member States would have to strictly follow the relevant procedure
provided for this in the agreements themselves.””°

208. A request to terminate can logically only mean that the Commission thinks that such
termination has not yet taken place. This conclusion has also been arrived at by the

tribunal in the Binder case:

Moreover, the EU documents to which the Parties have referred in this case do not
show that, in the opinion of the EU institutions, BITs have automatically ceased to
be operative once both Contracting States have become Member States of the EU.
The issue of whether measures should be envisaged to terminate intra-EU BITs as
not being well adapted to internal co-operation within the EU has given rise to
some debate within the EU but has not been finally settled even as a policy matter
to this date.”””

209. The Tribunal thus comes to the same conclusion as the Eureko tribunal concerning the
termination of the BIT, when it noted that “[nJothing in the text of the EU Treaties
produces that result; and the necessary intention is not established by extraneous

evidence.””**

210. The Tribunal thus concludes that, even if the BIT and the ECT were considered as
having the same subject matter, the BIT could not be deemed terminated on the basis of

a common intention of the Parties.

The Tribunal therefore turns to the objective question outlined in paragraph 186, above,
namely whether there is such a measure of incompatibility between the provisions of
the BIT and the ECT that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same

time.

The Tribunal considers that there does not exist such an incompatibility between the
two treaties that the former, the BIT, must be considered as having been automatically
terminated. The same solution has indeed been adopted in Binder, Eastern Sugar and
Eureko. Before elaborating on a comparison between the two treaties, the Tribunal will

however try to clarify the meaning of “incompatibility” in the VCLT.

(i) What is the test for finding that there is “incompatibility”?
The Tribunal will first address the question on a theoretical plane: what does it mean to

say that two treaties are incompatible?

For the Respondent, it is not necessary that one act be permissible under one treaty, but
not permissible under the other treaty for incompatibility to arise. Rather, it is
sufficient that “a treaty frustrates the goals of another treaty without there being any

incompatibility stricto sensu between their respective provisions.”””

The Claimant has offered a definition of what “incompatibility” means during the oral

hearing, when it explained that

Theoretically, substantive incompatibility only if, in EU law, either

(i) mandatory higher protection standard than in BIT
(ii) mandatory lower protection standard than in BIT.

230

In the Tribunal’s view, as always when interpreting a treaty, it is necessary to go back
to the ordinary meaning of the text. According to the Tribunal, “incompatibility” is
explained in the text of Article 59 of the VCLT itself, by the words that are used: “the
two treaties cannot be applied at the same time.” The Tribunal considers that this

phrase limits incompatibility to the case where one treaty requires what the other treaty

s in original).

prohibits; in other words, conflict occurs when compliance with one treaty necessarily
causes a breach of the other treaty. The Tribunal does not consider that incompatibility
extends to a situation where something that is forbidden under the BIT is merely

permitted by EU law, or vice versa.”

217. This means, a fortiori, that the Tribunal does not consider that two treaties are
incompatible when they point in the same direction or when the rules they adopt are

similar.

(ii) Applying that test, are the BIT and the ECT so far incompatible that
they are not capable of being applied at the same time?

218. The Respondent, while claiming that the two treaties are “incompatible”, explains that,
in its view, “it cannot be seriously doubted that, in the scope of their attention, they
address very much the same subject and indeed do so in very similar ways.”’* In the
Tribunal’s view, as already mentioned, this is a conflation of two distinct conditions for
the application of Article 59 of the VCLT, the “sameness” and the “incompatibility.”
The Tribunal finds it difficult to accept the idea that two treaties dealing with the same
topic in a similar way are completely incompatible. It would rather consider that the
two treaties go in the same direction and are therefore complementary rather than

mutually exclusive.

219. In the concrete case at hand, the Claimant argues that no such incompatibility exists and

moreover that the provisions of the two treaties are

even less incompatible in such a way that they were not capable of being applied at
the same time. The core subject of the Treaty is the protection of already existing
investments (the “post-establishment” phase) whereas EU law concentrates on the

I : . , . oe .
This position was however adopted in other fora dealing with international economic relations as mentioned

by the Respondent in its Reply: The World Trade Organization panel in the Bananas III case defined the notion
of “conflict” between obligations under GATT 1994 and the Annex 1A WTO Agreements along similar lines.
The panel stressed that the conflict clause is designed to deal with clashes between obligations contained in
GATT 1994 and obligations contained in agreements listed in Annex 1A, not only where those obligations are
mutually exclusive (in the sense that a Member cannot comply with both obligations at the same time), but also
where “a rule in one agreement prohibits what a rule in another agreement explicitly permits.” Respondent's

relate to their common subject matter in similar ways and, in fact, establish substantially equivalent substantive
and procedural investment protections.”

free movement of goods, persons, services and capital ... thus the ‘pre-
establishment’ phase.”
Even if one looks at the standards of protection during the investment phase, no
incompatibility can be found:
The guarantees provided in the Treaty and the fundamental EU freedoms the EU
Commission considers as infringed by the Slovak Republic exist side by side and
“point” into the same direction.”
The Tribunal has been quite convinced by the powerful demonstration of the
Respondent that, if it is admitted that the two treaties have the same subject matter
(which is not, of course, the conclusion of the Tribunal, but is discussed here for the
sake of completeness and clarification of the issues), they deal with the common
questions in quite a similar way, with one exception which will be dealt with further

below.
The Respondent explains that covered investors and investments are similar:

[t]he EC Treaty ensures protection of an investment made in an EU Member State
to the same circle of entities as that under the BIT.”**

In conclusion, EU law covers investments of the same type as covered under the
BIT.°
Moreover, “with regard to the pre-establishment phase, both the BIT and EU law offer
the same concrete protection to investors by supporting market access and prohibiting
any restrictions thereof.’ The same analysis is pursued as far as the protection of

investment during the investment period is concerned.

Concerning first the protection against expropriation, which was not initially clearly
expressed in EU law, the Respondent argues that this is no longer true, because of the
adoption of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU which formalised the attitude
of the EU towards fundamental human rights and in particular the provisions of the

European Convention on Human Rights (“ECHR”) and the jurisprudence of the

ECtHR. As a consequence, the protection against expropriation is equivalent in EU law

and in the BIT.**
224. The Respondent’s analysis of the other standards of protection is to the same effect:

Treatment standards established in the BIT, such as non-expropriation, “fair and
equitable treatment,” “national treatment,” “most favored nation treatment”,
correspond to core “treatment standards” in EU law, enunciated in the EC Treaty
provisions regarding the fundamental freedoms.””

EU law includes protections that are very much equivalent to the composite
obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment under the BIT.”

It follows that the protection and security of investments guaranteed by EU law
overlaps completely with the scope of protection considered to be afforded under
the most liberal interpretation of the “full protection and security” standard that
sometimes has been asserted by claimants or the decisions of international
investment tribunals.”'

225. Lastly, the Respondent also mentions the overlap of the provisions concerning the free

movement of capital and the free transfer of payments.

226. Without adhering necessarily to all the details or implications of the Respondent’s
comparative presentation of a certain number of provisions, the Tribunal considers that
it presents an accurate general picture of the plain fact that the two treaties are far from

being so incompatible that they cannot be applied at the same time.
227. A similar conclusion was reached by the Binder tribunal:

The Arbitral Tribunal further cannot find that the invoked substantive provisions
of the Czech-German BIT, i.e. Article 2(2), which provides for protection against
impairment of investments by arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, Article 2(3),
which ensures full protection of investments and revenues, Article 4(1), which
provides for full protection and security of investments, and Article 4(2), which
stipulates that expropriation must be for public benefit and must be accompanied
by full compensation, are in any way in conflict with EC law. Consequently, there

 

?38 The Respondent stresses the fact that considering the narrow dispute settlement in the precise BIT at stake,
there is no dispute resolution for expropriation, but only for compensation in case of expropriation, which
renders EU law even more favorable than the BIT.

is no substantive conflict with EC law, and the question of the primacy of EC law

does not arise in respect of these provisions.”

If indeed, the investors are protected in a similar way by two different regimes, why
should only one of these regimes be applicable? In such a factual situation, the Tribunal
considers that far from being necessarily incompatible, the parallel rules under the BIT

and the ECT, can be cumulatively applied.

The same idea was put forward in the SPP case™’, where the issue was whether the use
of ICC arbitration excluded the use of ICSID arbitration:

[i]t matters not how many different paths are pursued in an effort to obtain that
remedy.”

There is in this case no inconsistency in pursuing alternative remedies ... The
Claimants are trying to find a competent forum in which to adjudicate their
claim™*

Thus, the possibility arises that concurrent jurisdiction might be exercised with
respect to the same Parties, the same facts and the same cause of action by two
different arbitral tribunals.

When the jurisdictions of two unrelated and independent tribunals extend to the

same dispute, there is no rule of international law which prevents either tribunal

from exercising its jurisdiction.”
Although the Tribunal is aware that the issues can be distinguished, it considers that the
main idea underlying the SPP decision is apposite in this case, i.e. that the existence of
several fora for obtaining remedies does not render them incompatible.“* On the
contrary, they must be considered as parallel since they enhance the protection of the

investor.

The parallel rules under the BIT and the ECT are not incompatible, but should be

viewed as cumulative. This kind of situation is frequent in international law and has

never meant that only one set of rules can be applied. For example, in the Southern
Bluefin Tuna case (2000), Japan had argued inter alia that the 1993 Convention on the
Conservation of the Southern Bluefin Tuna applied to the case both as /ex specialis and
lex posterior, excluding the application of the 1982 UNCLOS. The arbitration tribunal,
however, held that both the 1982 as well as the 1993 instrument were applicable. The

tribunal recognised that

. it is a commonplace of international law and State practice for more than one
treaty to bear upon a particular dispute. There is no reason why a given act of a
State may not violate its obligations under more than one treaty. There is
frequently a parallelism of treaties, both in their substantive content and in their
provisions for settlement of disputes arising thereunder. The current range of
international legal obligations benefits from a process of accretion and
cumulation.”

232. This parallelism and complementarity of the BIT and the ECT has also frequently been
emphasised in legal writings. For example, Dr Christian Tietje analyses the interaction

of the two treaties in the following way:

There are no convincing legal reasons that would cause intra-EU BITs to be
classified as being per se incompatible with the law of the European Union. Also
in the context of EU law, bilateral investment protection treaties are “added” legal
guarantees for investors. ... The cancellation of bilateral investment protection
treaties between EU member states as demanded by the EU Commission would
thus deprive EU citizens of subjective rights. This would be an unparalleled
occurrence as regards fundamental principles of the European Union ... Intra-EU
BITs help to increase and enhance the overall level of legal protection of economic
subjects in the internal market.’*”

233. Although it deals with the BIT between a Member (Slovakia) and a non Member of the
EU (Switzerland) as well as the Energy Charter Treaty on the one side and EU law on
the other, the Tribunal considers the opinion of the Advocate-General Jéaskinen in Case
C-264/09, European Commission v. Slovak Republic very apposite to the question it is

discussing here:

With respect to the enjoyment and protection of investments, the general level of
the protection of fundamental rights provided by EU law affords protection to

investors, which fulfils the obligations resulting from Article 10(1) and 13(1) of
the ECT"!
234. The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent’s contention that the objective test in
Article 59 VCLT has been met in the present case; the provisions of the BIT and the

ECT are not so incompatible that the two treaties cannot be applied at the same time.

(3) Is termination under Article 59 of the VCLT subject to the notification requirement of
Article 65 of the VCLT?

235. The Tribunal’s conclusions regarding the application of Article 59 VCLT make it
unnecessary to consider the Claimant’s alternative argument based upon Article 65

VCLT.

(4) Conclusion

236. The conclusion of the Tribunal is that the two treaties — the BIT and the EC Treaty — do
not have the same subject matter and can therefore be applied in parallel and be
interpreted so as to be in harmony. Subsidiarily, the Tribunal finds that, even if the two
treaties were to be considered to have the same subject matter, they still can be applied
in parallel, first because no common intent to terminate the BIT can be ascertained
either from the texts of the relevant treaties nor from the behaviour of the States Parties
and secondly because far from being so incompatible as not being capable of being
applied at the same time, they provide in some cases for very similar protections and
even in cases where they differ — like for the procedures to obtain a remedy — they are

complementary.
237. The same three-fold conclusion was reached by the tribunal in the Eastern Sugar case:

First, the Arbitral Tribunal does not accept the Czech Republic's argument that the
EU treaty as the later treaty (as between the Czech Republic and the Netherlands)
covers the same subject matter as the BIT, the earlier treaty.

?5! Advocate General’s Opinion of 15 March 2011, European Commission v. Slovakia, Case C-264/09
(RL-313), 52. Article 10(1) of the ECT sets forth obligations for the promotion, protection and treatment of
investments which include the commitment to accord at all times fair and equitable treatment and constant
protection and security. Article 13(1) provides for guarantees against expropriation.

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Page 74 of 160

Second, the Czech Republic has not established that the common intention of the
Czech Republic and the Netherlands was that the EU Treaty would supersede the
BIT.

Third, the Arbitral tribunal is of the view that the BIT and the EU Treaty are not
incompatible?
238. The overall conclusion of the Tribunal is therefore that the BIT has not been
automatically terminated by application of Article 59 of the VCLT and has therefore to

be considered as a treaty in force.”

D. THE ISSUE OF THE APPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 30(3) OF THE VCLT IMPLYING

THE INAPPLICABILITY OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE BIT
239. The second strand of the first objection raised by the Respondent is that Article 8 of the
BIT has to be considered inapplicable by virtue of Article 30(3) of the VCLT.
According to Article 30(3) of the VCLT, when all the States Parties to an anterior treaty
are also States Parties to a posterior treaty, and the earlier treaty is not terminated or
suspended by operation of Article 59 of the VCLT, the “earlier treaty applies only to
the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.” Article
30(4) of the VCLT adds that, “[w]hen the parties to the later treaty do not include all
the parties to the earlier one, (a) as between States Parties to both treaties the same rule

254

applies.

240. Unlike Article 59 of the VCLT, Article 30(3) of the VCLT requires no proof of the
States Parties’ intention to terminate a particular provision and does not relate to the
incompatibility of the treaties as a whole, but rather to the incompatibility of specific

provisions.

 

252 Eastern Sugar, supra note 22, §]159, 167-168 (emphasis in original).

253 Tt is interesting to note that this position concerning intra-EU BITs has not only been adopted in international
arbitration, but also by national courts. It is noteworthy that the Czech courts have indeed confirmed, in the
course of an unsuccessful challenge of the Binder decision, the existence of the BIT between the Czech and
Slovak Federative Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, and did not find any implied termination,
stating to the contrary that “the BIT is in the Appellate Court’s view valid and effective, as it has so far been a
component of valid legal orders of both states ...” See Czech Republic v. Binder, supra note 190.

°54 Tn fact the pertinent rule in this case, as the parties to the BIT and to the ECT are not all the same, is Article
30(4), which refers to Article 30(3); but as both Parties have only discussed the application of Article 30(3), the
Tribunal has used the same approach.

1. The Positions of the Parties

The Respondent argues that, under Article 30(3) of the VCLT, even if the BIT has not
been terminated by application of Article 59 of the VCLT, at least Article 8 of the BIT
must be deemed inapplicable as it is incompatible with EU law. The basis for such
finding of incompatibility, according to the Respondent, is to be found in Articles 12
and 292 of the EC Treaty. Article 12 prohibits discrimination inside the EU on grounds
of nationality and Article 292 prevents the submission of disputes between Member
States to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein — arbitration

not being referred to in the ECT.

This analysis of the Respondent has been strongly supported by the European
Commission, which seems concerned to protect what could be described as the ECJ’s
monopoly over the interpretation and application of EU law. According to the EC, the
EU is a system of integration, which implies that there must be a unique institution
entrusted with the final word on what EU law means, and the existence inside the EU of
arbitral tribunals dealing with the interpretation of EU law could jeopardise the uniform

application of EU law.

Both the Respondent and the EC rely on Article 292 of the EC Treaty (now Article 344
TFEU) which confers exclusive jurisdiction on the ECJ to deal with disputes among
Member States on the application of EU law in the following terms:
Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of this Treaty to any method of settlement other than those provided
for therein.
The EC points to Opinion 1/09 delivered by the ECJ on 8 March 2011, which
considered that the creation of a new Patent Court, to solve patent-related disputes

between European private parties, was against the basic principles of EU law.’*

Moreover, according to the Respondent and the EC, the fact that the BIT grants a right
to international arbitration on the basis of nationality is contrary to Article 12 of the

ECT. Article 12 provides:

Article 12

Within the scope of application of this Treaty, and without prejudice to any special
provisions contained therein, any discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be
prohibited.

The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251,

may adopt rules designed to prohibit such discrimination.
The Claimant, for its part, considers that Article 344 TFEU is only applicable to
disputes between States, as results from the plain wording of the text. Moreover, it
considers that there is absolutely no rule or principle in EU law that prevents an
arbitration between an EU investor and a Member State of the European Union. The
Claimant also argues that the so-called discrimination between nationals of a EU
Member State that can rely on international arbitration and others that cannot can be
solved by extending this right to all, rather than depriving those who benefit from it

under a BIT of this protection.

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal is not going to deal here with the issue of the general incompatibility of
the two treaties which has already been dealt with above, but only with the possible
incompatibility of Article 8 of the BIT with the ECT. The tribunal in Eureko has also
rightly pointed to the difference of approach of the two articles, Article 59 and Article
30 (3):
Under Article 30 the test is whether the two successive treaty provisions are
“compatible.” Under Article 59 the test is whether the provisions of the later
treaty are “so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are
not capable of being applied at the same time.” Article 30 may be triggered by the
slightest incompatibility between the provisions of the earlier and later treaties.*°
The Tribunal will examine successively whether Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible
with Article 292 of the ECT (now Article 344 TFEU) and/or with Article 12 of the ECT
(now Article 18 TFEU).

(1) Does Article 8 of the BIT violate Article 292 of the ECT (Article 344 TFEU)?

248.

249.

250.

251.

In the Tribunal’s view, Article 292 of the ECT (now Article 344 TFEU) does not
provide for an absolute monopoly of the ECJ over the interpretation and application of
EU law*’ and does not prevent many other judicial or arbitral institutions from
routinely dealing with EU law. The same conclusion was reached in Eureko B.V. v.

The Slovak Republic:

The argument that the ECJ has an “interpretative monopoly” and that the Tribunal
therefore cannot consider and apply EU law, is incorrect. The ECJ has no such
monopoly. Courts and arbitration tribunals throughout the EU interpret and apply
EU law daily. What the ECJ has is a monopoly on the final and authoritative
interpretation of EU law: but that is quite different. Moreover, even final courts
are not obliged to refer questions of the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ in all
cases. The acte clair doctrine is well-established in EU law.”
There are indeed numerous instances where EU law is applied outside the institutional
and judicial framework of the European Union, and experience shows that there is no
such thing as an absolute monopoly of the ECJ over the interpretation and application

of EU law.

It is first not contested that national courts and tribunals are frequently called upon to
interpret and apply EU law and their action in doing so is in no way incompatible with
EU law, even when (as is most commonly the case) they are located in Member States
of the EU which are subject to the requirements of Article 292 of the ECT (now Article
344 TFEU).

As far as the courts and tribunals of non-Member States are concerned, it is evident that
they cannot turn to the ECJ to submit to it a question of interpretation of EU law, but
this cannot mean that they are prevented from applying EU law, when under the choice
of law rules such law is applicable. In other words, to take an example, an Argentinian
tribunal, dealing with a dispute between an Argentinian company and a European
company, might well have to apply a mandatory rule of EU law applicable to the

dealings of the European company with non-EU companies. In such a case, this

?57 A similar conclusion was reached by the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main in its Decision of 10
May 2012, when dealing with a request by the Slovak Republic to set aside the Eureko Award: “[e]lven
independent of the stipulation of Art. 344 TFEU, it cannot be assumed that the ECJ holds a monopoly on
interpreting EU law.” See Frankfurt Court, supra note 3, p. 22.

258 Eureko, supra note 21, 4282.

application cannot be controlled by the ECJ if there is no enforcement in Europe. As
all of this takes place outside Europe, there seems to be no reason to require the
intervention of the ECJ as an EU institution. However, if the award is susceptible of

integration into the institutional and judicial framework of the European Union, i.e. if

 

there is an attempt at enforcement in Europe through the relevant procedure, there may
be the possibility of intervention by the ECJ if the enforcement raises questions of
compatibility with EU law. In this case, the control by the ECJ is not a certainty: it
depends on the willingness of the court of the Member State where enforcement is
sought to submit a question of interpretation to the ECJ — and therefore it remains only

a possibility.

252. As far as the courts and tribunals of the Member States are concerned, a certain
uniformity of interpretation is without doubt rendered possible by their capacity (for
any court or tribunal) and their obligation (for a court or tribunal of last resort under
national law) to submit preliminary questions of interpretation of EU law to the ECJ by
virtue of Article 234 of the EC Treaty (now Article 267 TFEU).*” But even in this
situation, the ECJ does not have an absolute monopoly. The Tribunal stresses the fact
that national courts have a certain degree of discretion in their decision to refer a
question of interpretation to the ECJ, and that the courts of last resort may use the
theory of the “acte clair” to maintain some discretion as well. In other words, there is
no automatic seizure or ex officio seizure of the ECJ as soon as EU law is at stake,
which leaves open, even if not very broadly, the possibility of divergent interpretations

of EU law.

253. Secondly, EU law is also routinely applied in arbitration, in other words, outside the
institutional and judicial framework of the European Union. It is the Claimant’s

submission that, if the Respondent’s analysis were to prevail, this would be the end of

259 Article 267 (ex Article 234 ECT): “The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give
preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union;
Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it
considers that a decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the Court to give a
ruling thereon.
Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or tribunal of a Member State against whose
decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring the matter before the
Court.”

arbitration in the European Union, as underscored, for example, in the Claimant’s
observations on the amicus curiae briefs, where it stated that “the logical culmination
of the EU Commission’s argument would be the end of arbitration within the EU.”
This is indeed inherent in the EC position as expressed in its Submission, where it
argued that “all natural and legal persons, as well as states that are directly or indirectly
involved in the arbitration ... are subject to and bound by the law of the European
Union. All are therefore required to respect the primacy of European Union law as well

as the autonomy of its judicial system.”**!

As far as arbitration is concerned, it appears that Article 344 TFEU (formerly Article
292 ECT) precludes arbitration between Member States regarding their obligations
under EU law. This has indeed been decided by the ECJ in the Mox Plant case*”,
between the UK and Ireland, where the ECJ stated that EU Member States are
prevented from submitting their disputes to “any other method of dispute settlement”
than the ones provided for by EU law, and that the ECJ has exclusive jurisdiction in
resolving a dispute between two EU Member States that is at least partially covered by

EU law.

However, the Tribunal does not consider that this solution can be transposed to a case
like the present one. There is no provision in the ECT, equivalent to Article 344 TFEU,
dealing with arbitration between two or more private parties, nationals of Member
States, or with the so-called mixed disputes settlement mechanisms like investment
arbitration between individuals who are nationals of Member States and Member
States. In other words, the principles set out in Article 292 (now Article 344 TFEU) are

not applicable to these situations.

Concerning arbitration between two private parties, it has been recognised by the ECJ
that arbitrations between private parties, which apply EU law, are perfectly possible
and are not in contradiction with any monopoly of interpretation of EU law by the ECJ,

as illustrated for example in the Eco Swiss case. The main reason the ECJ did not

find such arbitration objectionable was because the arbitration in that case, having been
established in accordance with the rules of the Netherlands Arbitration Institute, was
therefore placed under the control of the Dutch courts, which could seek the
interpretation of the ECJ on the basis of Article 234 of the EC Treaty (now Article 267
TFEU). But in such a case, again, the same remark that was made concerning the

decisions of national courts which are not compelled to refer to the ECJ is apposite.

Concerning arbitration between one Member State and nationals of another Member
State — which is the situation encountered in the present case — it is the view of the
Tribunal that it does not come under Article 292 of the EC Treaty (now Article 344
TFEU) and is therefore perfectly compatible with EU law.

A first remark is that, even, if it were argued that the Member State cannot “submit” a
dispute to arbitration with a private party, it is uncontested that Slovakia, being the
Respondent in this case, has not “submitted” any dispute to this Tribunal. It has merely

defended its positions against the claims of Euram Bank.

Moreover, there is indeed no rule in EU law that forbids such a type of arbitration. In
this case, an arbitration brought under the UNCITRAL Rules and seated in Stockholm,
Swedish law applies as the /ex arbitri, and the award rendered by this Tribunal is
therefore placed under the control of the Swedish courts, which could, as shown
specifically by the case of Eco Swiss, seek the interpretation of the ECJ on the basis of
Article 234 of the EC Treaty (now Article 267 TFEU).

In fact, this position has been reiterated by the ECJ in other cases involving arbitral

awards as has been brought to the attention of the Tribunal by the Claimant:

In at least two other cases that were referred to it by a Spanish and a Slovak court
for a preliminary ruling at the stage of the enforcement of arbitral awards that had
been rendered against consumers in their absence, the ECJ confirmed that national
courts of EU Member States have to interpret EU law at the enforcement stage,
thereby making clear once again that (i) arbitration is admissible even though
arbitrators may have to apply EU rules and (ii) that national courts of EU Member
states are not deprived of the power to refer matters for a preliminary ruling just
because the dispute was decided by an arbitral tribunal rather than a court. Both

 

position was adopted in the field of consumer rights, see for example, Case C-168/05, Elisa Maria Mostaza
Claro v. Centro Mévil Milenium SL, Judgment of 26 October 2006, [2006] ECR I-10421.

cases involved the interpretation of Council Directive 93/13 EEC of 5 April 1993
on unfair terms in consumer contracts. The Spanish case” concerned the issue of
an unfair arbitration clause in a consumer contract. The Slovak case*** dealt with a

potentially unfair penalty applied in an arbitral award rendered against a

consumer.”*°

261. Contrary to the arguments of the Respondent and the EC, the Tribunal considers that
the analysis, according to which arbitration between private parties or a private party
and a Member State is not contrary to EU law, is not contradicted by Opinion 1/09 of
the Court (Full Court) of 8 March 2011°’, an opinion delivered pursuant to
Article 218(11) TFEU.** That case can be distinguished on several accounts from the
present situation. The question was whether the creation of a Patent Court (“PC”) by
an international agreement was contrary to the exclusivity of the EU courts:

1. The request submitted for the Opinion of the Court by the Council of the
European Union is worded as follows:

“Ts the envisaged agreement creating a Unified Patent Litigation System (currently
named European and Community Patents Court) compatible with the provisions of
the Treaty establishing the European Community?”

262. On the issue of whether Article 292 ECT (now Article 344 TFEU) applies to the
mechanisms of the settlement of disputes involving private parties, the answer was
unambiguously negative:

Nor can the creation of the PC be in conflict with Article 344 TFEU, given that
that article merely prohibits Member States from submitting a dispute concerning
the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other
than those provided for in the Treaties. The jurisdiction which the draft agreement
intends to grant to the PC relates only to disputes between individuals in the field
of patents?
263. It is true that, in fine, the ECJ considered the creation of the PC to be in violation of the

monopoly of the ECJ, but this was the monopoly of rendering judgments, or at least

having the last word, not only on the interpretation of the EC Treaty but also on the
validity of decisions of the EU organs and institutions, provided for in Article 230 (now
Article 263 TFEU)*”, stating that “the PC may be called upon to determine a dispute
pending before it in the light of the fundamental rights and general principles of
European Union law, or even to examine the validity of an act of the European Union.”
The difference between the PC and the present Tribunal was, quite rightly in the view
of the Tribunal, argued by the Claimant.’’' It is not alleged that, in the present case, the
Tribunal is entrusted with a determination of the validity of an act of one of the
European Union institutions. Another distinguishing factor between the PC and the
present UNCITRAL arbitration is the impossibility of bringing infringement
proceedings against the decisions of the PC, while it is possible to have infringement
proceedings in the case of awards of arbitral tribunals constituted under the BIT like

this Tribunal, at the stage of enforcement in the European Union.

Indeed, if a Member State were minded to enforce an arbitral award that would violate
EU law, tools remain in the hands of the EU institutions — and particularly the ECJ — to
ensure a proper application of EU law. The Tribunal considers it noteworthy to quote
here Article 226 ECT (now Article 258 TFEU) and Article 228 ECT*” (now Article
260 TFEU):

Article 226

If the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation
under this Treaty, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the
State concerned the opportunity to submit its observations.

If the State concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid
down by the Commission, the latter may bring the matter before the Court of
Justice.

27 Article 263 (ex Article 230 ECT): “The Court of Justice of the European Union shall review the legality of

legislative acts, of acts of the Council, of the Commission ...”
2" Claimant’s Comment, 421.
?? This Article was indeed cited in the Observations of the European Commission, at 427: “If a Member State

does not comply with this obligation, the Commiss

 

 

n can bring the matter directly before the European Court

of Justice in accordance with Article 88 (2) EC. If the judgment of the Court of Justice is not complied with, the
Court may impose pecuniary sanctions in accordance with Article 228 (2) EC.”

Article 228 (1)

If the Court of Justice finds that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation
under this Treaty, the State shall be required to take the necessary measures to
comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice. (emphasis added)

265. In other words, even when cases are brought to arbitration, if they are to be enforced in

the EU, the ECJ maintains the possibility, through different mechanisms, to have the

273

final and authoritative word on the interpretation of EU law.

266. As a last subsidiary remark, the Tribunal wishes to draw attention to the fact that EU
law has indeed already been applied by arbitration tribunals, without raising any
problems. To give just an example, in the Maffezini case, the arbitral tribunal
interpreted and applied EU law in order to analyse the extent of the investor’s rights, as

can be seen from the following extract:

Particularly noteworthy is the legislation on EIA. Strict procedures in this respect
are provided in EEC Directive 85/337 of June 27, 1985 and in Spain’s Royal
Legislative Decree No. 1302/1986 of June 28, 1986.24 Chemical industries are
specifically required under both measures to undertake an EIA. Public
information, consultation with pertinent authorities, licensing and other procedures
are also a part thereof. The EEC Directive, like the one that later came to amend
it, requires “that an EJA is undertaken before consent is given to certain public and
private projects considered to have significant environmental implications.”
Suspension of projects can be ordered under Spanish law, particularly if work
thereon is begun before the EIA is approved.’

267. In sum, the Tribunal considers that, if the BIT and the ECT were considered as having
the same subject matter, the application of Article 30(3) of the VCLT would not result
in the inapplicability of Article 8 of the BIT, because of an incompatibility with Article
292 ECT (now Article 344 TFEU).””

273 A similar conclusion was reached by the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main in its Decision of 10
May 2012, when dealing with a request of the Slovak Republic to set aside the Eureko Award: “It is therefore
the view of the Senate that it is not the case that arbitration proceedings are entirely removed from the
institutional and judiciary framework of the EU.” Frankfurt Court Decision, supra note 3, p. 21.

added).

275 The same conclusion was reached by the Higher Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main in its Decision of 10
May 2012, when dealing with a request of the Slovak Republic to set aside the Eureko Award: “The prevailing
view in the commentaries and literature takes this to mean that Art. 344 TFEU only covers disputes between
Member States. ... In contrast ... there is no source to be found that specifically holds the view that Art. 344
TFEU is also applicable to a dispute between a private individual and an EU Member State. ... The possible risk
of arbitral awards that contradict EU law, however, cannot constitute a direct application of Art. 344 TFEU to

(2) Does Article 8 of the BIT violate Article 12 of the ECT (Article 18 TFEU)?

268. This question might seem at first glance more difficult, as mentioned by the Claimant’s
expert, Professor August Reinisch: “Under the EU legal regime the availability of

remedies for only some EU nationals but not for all others may be problematic.”””°

269. The Tribunal considers that it is not possible to avoid this question by a mere statement
that Article 8 of the BIT does not introduce any aspect of discrimination, as the Binder
tribunal did when it stated:

The fact that, when there is a BIT, such national remedy is replaced or
supplemented by an international arbitration mechanism does not, in the Arbitral

Tribunal's view, involve any discrimination and is not otherwise incompatible with
EC rules and principles.”””

270. The question is indeed somewhat more complex, as recognised by the Claimant’s
expert, Professor Reinisch. However, Professor Reinisch immediately provides
methods of resolving this seemingly problematic question. The first answer is that any
possible discrimination might be taken up by the European institutions to sanction a
Member State for violation of EU law, but that such discrimination has no consequence
on the validity of the treaty under public international law: “this is an internal EU law
problem and not an issue of treaty compatibility.”*”* The Tribunal is convinced by this

analysis.

271. Moreover, Professor Reinisch adds that it is for those suffering from discrimination to
seek enforcement of their rights, by obtaining an extension of the favourable treatment
granted in the Austria-Slovakia BIT to them:

Furthermore, this consequence may be avoided by extending the favourable
treatment accorded to BIT partners to all other EU Member States.””

 

state/investor disputes per se. ... The case law of the ECJ — insofar as apparent and submitted by the parties —
does not provide any indication that Art. 344 TFEU would also apply directly to disputes between a Member
State and an investor of another Member State, or that the general competence of investment tribunals was in
question.” Frankfurt Court Decision, supra note 3, pp. 18-20.

272. The same idea was developed by other tribunals. Thus, the tribunal in Eastern Sugar
stated:

If the BIT gives rights to the Netherlands and to Dutch investors that it does not
give other EU countries and investors, it will be for those other countries and
investors to claim their equal rights.

If the EU Treaty gives more rights than does the BIT, then all EU parties,
including the ... investors, may claim those rights. If the BIT gives rights to the

. investors that it does not give other EU countries and investors, it will be for
those other countries and investors to claim their equal rights.**°

Similarly, the tribunal in Eureko said that

There is moreover no reason, legal or practical, why an EU Member State should
not accord to investors of all other EU Member States rights equivalent to those
which the State has bound itself to accord to investors of its EU bilateral
investment treaty partners ... **!

273. This discrimination can also easily be remedied by the application of the EU principle
of freedom of establishment, as mentioned by Austria in its submission, explaining that
other EU nationals can put themselves in the same situation as Austrian nationals, and
therefore benefit from the substantive and procedural protection of the BIT:

Furthermore, other EU nationals enjoy the freedom of establishment. If they want
to take advantage of the provisions of the Austro-Slovakian BIT for their
investments in one of those States, they are free to organise their investment in a
way that allows them to do so. The only precondition is to qualify as an investor
in terms of the BIT, which can easily be achieved in exercising the freedom of
establishment.”

274. More generally, the Tribunal considers that EU law does not exclude the existence of
bilateral treaties giving some advantages to the nationals of the States Parties, if these
advantages are reciprocal. The Tribunal can take inspiration here from the “D” case.

In this case, under a bilateral tax treaty between the Netherlands and Belgium some tax

 

Eureko Award : “The Senate, in agreement with the arbitral tribunal, does consider it possible that an arbitration
clause which only grants certain investors access to arbitration proceedings might violate the non-discrimination
rule of EU law, yet this does not lead to the conclusion that the present claimant is denied access to an arbitral
tribunal; for ultimately, a possible violation can only lead to an expansion of the rights of other investors as well,
yet not to a restriction of the claimant's rights.” Frankfurt Court Decision, supra note 3, p. 25.

advantages were granted to Belgian citizens which were not granted to German
nationals under the bilateral tax treaty between the Netherlands and Germany. This
appears on its face to be discrimination between German nationals and Belgium
nationals, the same kind of discrimination as that said to exist in this case between the
rights of investors benefiting from a BIT and those who do not benefit from such a BIT.
On a reference from a Dutch court, the ECJ stated in its opinion, “... the national court
inquires whether, in light of the Treaty, the different treatment, in such a case, of a

resident of Belgium and a resident of Germany is lawful.””**
275. The arguments of the parties, as summarised by the ECJ, were the following:

Mr D. submits that the difference, resulting from application of the Belgium-
Netherlands Convention, between his situation and that of a resident of Belgium in
an equivalent situation amounts to discrimination prohibited by the Treaty.”

The governments which have submitted observations and the Commission submit
conversely that the different treatment of a person such as Mr D. and a resident of
Belgium is not discriminatory. They argue that a Member State party to a bilateral
convention is not in any way required, by virtue of the Treaty, to extend to all
Community residents the benefits which it grants to residents of the Contracting
Member State. Those governments and the Commission refer to the danger which
the extension of the benefits provided for by a bilateral convention to all
Community residents would entail for the application of existing bilateral
conventions and of those which the Member States might be prompted to conclude
in the future, and to the legal uncertainty which that extension would cause.”*°

276. As explained by commentators on this decision, the governments which presented their
views to the ECJ — the Netherlands, Belgium, France and Germany — as well as the
European Commission considered that a finding of non-discrimination should be
arrived at based on “the concept that a Member State that is a party to a bilateral
convention is not in any way required, by virtue of the EC Treaty, to extend to all
Community residents the benefits that it grants to residents of the other contracting

Member State.””*°

277. The ECJ considered that in the absence of European measures of harmonisation on the

question dealt with in the relevant bilateral treaties and the absence as well of a

multilateral treaty on the issue, it was left to the Member States to adopt bilateral
treaties with reciprocal rights and obligations,**’ causing the ones subject to one of these
treaties to be considered as not being in the same situation than the ones subject to
another treaty. Therefore, the ECJ did not consider this situation to be a violation of the
principle of non-discrimination, on the basis of the idea that the rights in these treaties

were fundamentally based on reciprocity, and could therefore not be compared:

The fact that those reciprocal rights and obligations apply only to persons resident
in one of the two Contracting Member States is an inherent consequence of
bilateral double taxation conventions. It follows that a taxable person resident in
Belgium is not in the same situation as a taxable person resident outside Belgium
so far as concerns wealth tax on real property situated in the Netherlands.

A rule such as that laid down in Article 25(3) of the Belgium-Netherlands
Convention cannot be regarded as a benefit separable from the remainder of the
Convention, but is an integral part thereof and contributes to its overall balance.”**
It seems to the Tribunal that the exact same reasoning can be followed for the BITs
which are based on reciprocal rights and obligations, with the result that the situation of

the different investors cannot be compared.

(3) Conclusion

279.

280.

In sum, the Tribunal considers that, if the BIT and the ECT were considered as having
the same subject matter, the application of Article 30(3) of the VCLT would not result
in the inapplicability of Article 8 of the BIT, on the grounds of incompatibility with
either Article 292 ECT (now Article 344 TFEU) or Article 12 ECT (now Article 18
TFEU).

As a general conclusion, the Tribunal reiterates that, in its view, the BIT and the ECT
do not have the same subject matter, and as such coexist and are complementary in the
international sphere, where they should be interpreted in harmony with one another. In
addition, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that, if the BIT and the ECT were

considered to have the same subject matter, the BIT would not be terminated under

287 Tbid., $950-51: “...no unifying or harmonising measure for the elimination of double taxation had yet been
adopted at Community level and that the Member States had not yet concluded any multilateral convention to
that effect... In the absence of other Community measures or conventions involving all the Member States,
numerous bilateral conventions have been concluded between the latter.”

Article 59 of the VCLT, for lack of a common intention to terminate and for lack of
incompatibility; neither, in such hypothesis, would the application of Article 30(3) of
the VCLT compel the inapplicability of Article 8 of the BIT, as the Tribunal could trace

no EU tule which would be violated by such application.”

E. THE ISSUE OF THE APPLICATION OF EU LAW AS LEX ARBITRI

281. Lastly, the Tribunal turns to the final variant of the Respondent’s EU objection, that
based upon the relationship between EU law and the law of Sweden, where the

Tribunal has fixed its seat in accordance with Article 16(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

282. The Respondent maintains that the rules of EU law on which it relies form part of
Swedish law and therefore constitute part of the /ex arbitri. According to the
Respondent, it is a well-established principle of EU law that the supremacy of EU law
must be recognized and given effect by the laws of all EU Member States. For
example, the ECJ held in Commission v. Italy that “[i]n matters governed by the EC
Treaty, the treaty takes precedence over agreements concluded between the Member

States before its entry into force.’”””

283. The Respondent argues that the priority of EU law over incompatible pre-accession
agreements concluded between Member States is one such rule. Therefore, the
Respondent maintains that “the conflict between the dispute settlement clause of the

BIT and EU law can only be resolved by rendering Article 8 of the BIT inapplicable.””*!

284. The Respondent contests the Claimant’s characterisation of EU law and the Claimant’s
reliance on AES v. Hungary for the assertion that EU law should only be taken into
account as fact, alleging instead that, in addition to operating as international law, EU
law operates as part of Swedish law which constitutes the Jex arbitri° The
Respondent disputes the Claimant’s reliance on AES v. Hungary for the assertion that

EU law should only be considered as fact. Rather, the Respondent stresses that in AES

289 ‘This last conclusion was equally reached by the Binder tribunal, supra note 227, 465: “The Arbitral Tribunal
does not find either that Article 10(2) of the Czech-German BIT, which provides for a specific procedural
protection in the form of arbitration between the investor and the host State, is in conflict with EC Law.”

v. Hungary, the parties both agreed that EU law should be considered as fact, so the
tribunal did not concern itself with the international nature of EU law, but nevertheless
did highlight the dual nature of EU law.” Furthermore, the Respondent distinguishes
AES v. Hungary since it is an ICSID case which is therefore not governed by the /ex
loci arbitri, unlike the present case which is one involving an ad hoc tribunal subject to

Swedish arbitration law.”

The Tribunal considers that this argument requires only a very brief response. The
argument could only succeed if the exercise of jurisdiction under Article 8 of the BIT
would be contrary to a rule of EU law. The Tribunal has already held, however, that
there is no conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and EU law.

Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that this final strand of the Respondent’s intra-EU
BIT objection must be rejected for the reasons it has already given in relation to the

other strands of this objection.

F. CONCLUSION ON THE INTRA-EU BIT OBJECTION

For all the reasons explained in this Section devoted to the Respondent’s first

jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal rules that the objection is dismissed.

Ill. THE DIFFERENT TRANSLATIONS OF THE TREATY

The remaining jurisdictional objections all involve differences regarding the
interpretation of the BIT. Those differences are complicated by the fact that the BIT is
authentic in Czech and German and the Parties also disagree about the translation of the
BIT into English. Before considering the remaining objections, therefore, the Tribunal

must address the issue of translation.

The Claimant initially relied upon a translation (“Exhibit C1”) which was attached to
its pleadings** and was based upon the translation published in the UNTS.”° The
Respondent objected that this translation was inaccurate and submitted its own certified
translations from Czech (“Exhibit RL-40A”) and German (“Exhibit RL-40B”).”
While the Respondent maintained that there was no substantive difference between its
two translations and referred to RL-40B in its submissions, it contended that, in

298

accordance with the principles set out in Article 33 of the VCLT,** questions of
interpretation had to be resolved by reference to both texts and thus to both translations.
The Claimant accepted, during the hearings, that “C1” was unsatisfactory in certain
respects. The Tribunal therefore invited the Parties to agree upon a translation.*” After

the hearings, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to so agree.

The Claimant then tendered a new translation, attached as Annex 7 to this Award,
which differed from both “C1” and, to a lesser extent, “RL-40B”. The Respondent
objects to the submission of a new translation at such a late stage. The Tribunal agrees
that this late submission is less than optimal. Nevertheless, the Tribunal can derive
jurisdiction only from the terms of the BIT which are authentic only in Czech and
German. It cannot therefore exclude a translation which the Claimant now considers is

a more accurate rendition of the two authentic texts.

Since the differences between the Parties concern the four provisions most directly

relevant to the remaining jurisdictional objections, namely Articles 1, 2, 4 and 8, the

*°S attached as Annex 4 to the Award.

°° Attached as Annex 3 to the Award.

°°7 Attached as Annexes 5 and 6 respectively. The original Czech and German texts are at Annexes 1 and 2
respectively.

Article 4: Compensation

 

Respondent’s translation from German
(“RL-40B”)

Claimant’s post-hearing translation

 

 

(1) Expropriation measures, including
nationalization or other measures having the
same consequences, may be applied in the
territory of the other Contracting Party to
investments of investors of a Contracting
Party only in cases where these
expropriation measures are carried out for
reasons of public interest, on the basis of legal
proceedings and in return for compensation.

(2) The compensation must correspond to the
value of the investment, determined
immediately prior to the time when the actual
or impending expropriation measures were
made public. The compensation must be paid
without delay and, until it is paid, interest
shall be calculated on the amount of the
compensation in accordance with the usual
bank interest rate in the State in whose
territory the investment was made; it must be
freely transferable. Provision shall be made
in an appropriate manner no later than the
date of expropriation for determining and
paying compensation.

(3) If a Contracting Party expropriates the
assets of a company which is to be considered
a company of such Contracting Party under
Article 1 para. 2 of this Agreement and in
which an investor of the other Contracting
Party owns shares, the provisions of para. 1
above shall be applied in such a way as to
ensure adequate compensation of such an
investor.

(4) The investor shall have the right to have
the legitimacy of the expropriation reviewed
by the competent authorities of the Contracting
Party which prompted the expropriation.

(5) The investor shall have the right to have
the amount of the compensation and the
conditions of payment reviewed either by the
competent authorities of the Contracting Party
which prompted the expropriation or by an
arbitral tribunal according to Article 8 of this
Agreement.

 

(1) Investments by Investors of one
Contracting Party may only be
expropriated, nationalized or subject to
other measures having similar effect in the
territory of the other Contracting Party for
reasons of public interest, on the basis of legal
proceedings and in return for compensation.

(2) The compensation must correspond to the
value of the investment immediately prior to
the time when the actual or impending
expropriation measures became publicly
known. The compensation must be paid
without delay and, until payment, shall yield
interest based on the customary bank
interest rate of the State in whose territory the
investment was made; it must be freely
transferable. At the time of expropriation at
the latest, provisions shall have been made
in an appropriate manner for determining and
paying compensation.

(3) If a Contracting Party expropriates the
assets of a company which is to be considered
a company of that Contracting Party under
Article 1 para. 2 of this Agreement and in
which an investor of the other Contracting
Party owns shares, the provisions of para. 1
above shall be applied in such a way as to
ensure adequate compensation of such an
investor.

The Tribunal has scrutinised the differences between these translations with care.

Although some of the differences between the translations advanced by the Claimant

differences are not such as to affect the outcome of the present jurisdictional challenge.

The Tribunal has not, therefore, found it necessary to invite further submissions from

the Parties.

IV. SECOND OBJECTION: WHETHER EURAM’S CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF A
QUALIFYING INVESTMENT WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE TREATY

A. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

1. The Respondent

293. The Respondent’s second objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is that the dispute

at issue does not fall within the scope of Article 8(1) of the BIT, because it does not
arise out of an investment directly owned by the Claimant but rather out of a
shareholding in Apollo which was owned not by the Claimant but by the Claimant’s
subsidiary EIC. Since EIC was incorporated in Slovakia, the Respondent maintains
that the dispute falls outside the scope of Article 8(1). The Respondent argues that the
BIT covers only investments which are directly made by an Austrian investor in
Slovakia:

... EURAM’s claims do not arise out of a qualifying investment — the sine qua non

for protection under the Treaty — but rather out of an investment made by its

Slovak subsidiary. The Treaty’s disputes clause does not cover claims arising out
of indirectly-owned investments or investments made by host-country entities.*”

The Respondent advances five arguments in support of this objection.

294. First, the Respondent argues that the terms of the BIT, given their ordinary meaning,

demonstrate that it was the intention of the States Parties to exclude claims based upon
indirect ownership of investments. Citing Article 8(1) and 8(2) of the BIT, the
Respondent maintains that the only disputes which may be submitted to investor-State
arbitration under the BIT are those which “arise out of an investment, between a
Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party.”*” According to the
Respondent, “investment” is defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT as “all assets which an
investor of one Contracting Party invests in the territory of the other Contracting Party

in accordance with its legislation.”*"? The Respondent argues that investments covered

by the BIT are thus limited so that “the foreign investor must be the source of the
investment in the territory of the State concerned, not a local company in which the
investor has an interest.‘ According to the Respondent, a tribunal would have
jurisdiction “over disputes arising out of an asset of an Austrian company invested in
Slovakia. But it does not have jurisdiction over disputes arising out of assets invested
in Slovakia by that Austrian investor’s Slovak subsidiary.”*** Additionally, the
Respondent argues, the term “assets” referred to in Article 1(1) means assets “owned
by that investor, not assets owned by someone else.” Article 1(2) of the BIT, in
defining “investor,” further confirms that it is the entity with Austrian nationality that

must “make[] an investment in the territory of the [Slovak Republic].”*”

295. The Respondent maintains that its interpretation of the BIT is confirmed by the
approach taken in a number of other arbitration awards, in particular the award in
HICEE BV vy. Slovak Republic, which concerned the Netherlands-CSFR BIT,*” and the
award in Berschader v. Russia, which was made under the BIT between

Belgium/Luxembourg and the USSR.*”
296. The Respondent further refers to Article 4(3) of the Treaty, which provides as follows:

If a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is to be
considered a company of such Contracting Party under Article 1 para. 2 of this
Agreement and in which an investor of the other Contracting Party owns shares,
the provisions of para. 1 above shall be applied in such a way as to ensure
adequate compensation of such an investor.

For the Respondent, this provision demonstrates that the States Parties addressed
indirectly-owned assets where they wished to do so.*”” The Claimant’s interpretation

that all indirectly-owned investments would already be investments under Article 1(1),

the Respondent argues, would render Article 4(3) purposeless, thereby violating the

“fundamental principle of effectiveness” in treaty interpretation.*'

297. Secondly, the Respondent argues that general international law corroborates its

argument that the BIT excludes claims based upon indirect ownership of investments.*?

According to the Respondent, “in the absence of a specific provision forming /ex

specialis in a treaty, the rules of customary international law govern matters such as

3313

shareholder standing and nationality of claims.

298. In support, the Respondent refers to the judgments of the International Court of Justice
in Ahmadou Sadio Diallo Case.*'* According to the Respondent, in those judgments, the
ICJ reaffirmed the principle of distinct corporate personality in international law
originally stated by the Court in the Barcelona Traction and ELSI cases,** and

explained that the rights and assets of a company must be distinguished from the rights

316

and assets of a shareholder in that company.*'* The Respondent maintains that these

judgments state a general principle not confined to diplomatic protection.*”

299. The Respondent points to municipal and international law, citing Professor Sasson for
the theory that the “distinction between shareholders and their companies, which is
regulated at a municipal level, has to be maintained at an international plane, unless the

relevant treaty confers on shareholders the right to pursue their indirect claims and

consequently to pierce the corporate veil.”?"*

The Respondent also distinguishes Claimant’s reliance on Azurix v. Argentina and CMS
v. Argentina, arguing that they are “unhelpful to the Claimant because the US-
Argentina Treaty at issue in both those cases is precisely the kind of investment treaty

that expressly allows investors to assert such indirect investment claims.”*!”

Thirdly, according to the Respondent, the Treaty’s limitation to directly-owned
investments is confirmed by the travaux préparatoires, which it argues are relevant
under Article 32 of the VCLT.*” The Respondent points to a report submitted by the
Czechoslovak Federal Ministry of Finance together with the draft BIT with Austria for
parliamentary approval, which states that the Treaty “specifies the term ‘investment’
and ‘investor’ in connection with their participation in the business in the territory of

one of the Contractual Parties.”*'

Fourthly, the Respondent submits that treaty practice under other investment treaties
concluded by the Slovak Republic, Austria, and other States on indirect shareholder
investment confirm that claims like the Claimant’s are excluded under the Treaty.”
Discussing general treaty practice, the Respondent outlines three distinct approaches
taken by States when electing to move away from the limitations of municipal and
international law regarding the rights of indirect owners.** The treaties either grant
foreign-controlled local companies jus standi, make special provisions to allow
shareholders to claim on behalf of a local corporation where they own or control the
local corporation, or expressly extend access to arbitration for claims arising out of
investments indirectly controlled or owned by the claimant.** The Contracting Parties
to the instant Treaty intentionally, the Respondent concludes, “eschewed all three of

these means.”***

The Respondent also discusses the travaux préparatoires of the Netherlands-CSFR
BIT, which were prepared at the same time as the Austria-CSFR BIT which make clear
that the CSFR “did not consider the indirect investments of a foreign investor through a
local subsidiary to be international investments to be protected under investment

treaties” and was deliberate in its drafting so as to exclude them.”

Finally, the Respondent submits that the exclusion of claims based on indirect
ownership of investments is consistent with the Treaty’s object and purpose. In this
connection, the Respondent refers to three arbitration cases, Saluka v. Czech Republic,
Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic, and Berschader v. Russia, for the argument that
investment protection is but one of the aims of the Treaty, that investment treaties must
be interpreted in a balanced manner, and that limitations on the coverage of indirect
investors or the right to initiate an arbitration “cannot be deemed contrary to the

99327

Treaty’s object and purpose.

2. The Claimant

The Claimant contests the Respondent’s analysis of the issue and maintains that Euram
Bank’s investment is an “investment” within the meaning of the BIT.** The Claimant
maintains that the terms of the BIT, in their ordinary meaning, give a definition of
assets which is “broad in scope and capable of comprising both direct and indirect
investments.”*”” The Claimant argues that “Article 1(1) does not limit the investor in its
discretion to decide what kind of asset he wants to invest”, nor how or by what means:
“[t]he only condition is that the investment needs to be ‘in accordance with [the Host
State’s] /egislation’.”**° The enumeration of examples of what may constitute an
investment under Article 1(1) of the BIT is a non-exhaustive list.**' This “broad, open-

ended approach” to defining investments is typical, the Claimant argues.*”

306. The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s reliance on Article 4(3) of the BIT, arguing
that there “is nothing in Article 4(3) that would indicate that it was intended to modify

the definition of the term ‘investment’ as defined in Article 1.”* According to the
Claimant, the fact that Articles 2, 3, and 5 of the BIT do not specifically refer to
indirectly-owned investments also does not mean that these are not covered.** Similar
arguments were roundly rejected by the arbitration tribunal in Siemens v. Argentina

under the Germany-Argentina BIT.**

307. The Claimant argues that the inclusion of indirect investments is now typical of BITs
and in this connection relies upon the awards in Mobil Corporation, Venezuela
Holdings B.V. and ors v. Venezuela, Cemex Caracas Investments B.V. and Cemex

Caracas II Investments B.V. v. Venezuela, Siemens AG vy. Argentina, and

Kardassopoulos v. Georgia.**°

308. The Respondent’s reliance upon customary international law is said to be misplaced
since the customary law to which the Respondent refers is irrelevant for the purpose of
interpreting the term “investment” in the Treaty.**’ Specifically, the Claimant argues
that there is no reference in Article 31 of the VCLT to customary international law in

general; only Article 31(3)(c) “speaks of ‘relevant rules of international law applicable

999338,

in the relations between the parties’.

309. Contrary to the Respondent’s insistence that the Tribunal conduct an analysis under
customary international law, the Claimant argues that the Treaty is /ex specialis and

thereby displaces customary international law. According to the Claimant, the

Tribunal’s task “‘is an interpretative one, namely to determine whether the scope of the

term ‘investment’ is such as to comprise both direct and indirect investments.”*”

The Claimant criticises the Respondent’s reliance on ADM, Loewen, Barcelona
Traction, Diallo, and ELSI, arguing that the reliance on these cases is misplaced as they
do not address the same issues.*° Regarding Loewen, the Claimant submits that in that
case the tribunal found that “[t]here is no language in [NAFTA] which deals with the
question of whether nationality must continue to the time of resolution of the claim. It
is that silence in [NAFTA] that requires the application of customary international
law.*! This is in contrast to the CSFR-Austria BIT, “which is not silent on
‘investment’ and the mere necessity to interpret the term of a treaty must not be
confused with ‘silence’ that calls for an analysis under customary international law. To

the contrary, it prevents a reference to customary international law.”*?

Regarding the Respondent’s reliance on Barcelona Traction and Diallo, the Claimant
regards those cases as concerning “the issue of (diplomatic) protection by ‘substitution’
and centred on the question whether, in customary international law, there is an
exception to the general rule ‘that the right of diplomatic protection of a company
belongs to its national State’, which allows for protection of the shareholders by their
own national State ‘by substitution’.”* The Claimant asserts that there is no principle
of customary international law which considers “investment” to mean only “direct

investment”.

With regard to the travaux préparatoires, the Claimant argues that the Respondent has
not shown how the negotiating history of the Treaty is relevant, other than by referring

to Article 32 of the VCLT, whose conditions for application the Claimant maintains are

not satisfied.*** Moreover, the evidence offered only refers to the CSFR’s intention and

does not show that this intention was shared by Austria.*“°

The Claimant also takes issue with the Respondent’s reference to treaty practice and the
Treaty’s object and purpose.’ The Claimant states that the Respondent has failed to
explain the relevance of treaty practice as a supplementary means of interpretation.“ In
any event, the Claimant contends that “(t]he fact that treaties vary in their language
does not mean that language used in one treaty excludes something included in another

treaty or vice versa.”*”

The Claimant nonetheless points to treaties contemporaneous to the Austria~-CSFR BIT
to show that “whenever the Slovak Republic wanted to exclude indirect investment, it

did so.”**°

B. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

In considering the Respondent’s second objection, the Tribunal begins by noting that
the principles which it must apply to its task of interpretation of the Treaty are those set

out in Articles 31 to 33 of the VCLT:

Article 31: General Rule

(1) A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its
object and purpose.

(2) The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in
addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties
in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with
the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument
related to the treaty.

Page 104 of 160

(3) There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation
of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes
the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between
the parties.

(4) A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so
intended.

Article 32: Supplementary means of interpretation

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to
confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine
the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.
Article 33: Interpretation of Treaties authenticated in Two or More Languages

(1) When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is
equally authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties
agree that, in case of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.

(2) A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the
text was authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so
provides or the parties so agree.

(3) The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each
authentic text.

(4) Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1,
when a comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning
which the application of Articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning
which best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the
treaty, shall be adopted.

316. Since the Tribunal has already decided (paragraph 81, above) that the VCLT is
applicable to the BIT, these provisions govern the approach which the Tribunal must
take to the interpretation of the BIT. It is, however, well established that these
provisions state principles which are part of customary international law which would

be applicable in any event.

As the Tribunal can derive jurisdiction only from the terms of the BIT, it must begin by
considering the ordinary meaning to be given to those terms in their context and in light

of the object and purpose of the BIT.

According to Article 8(1) and 8(2) of the BIT, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction, it
must be faced with a dispute (1) between a Contracting Party and an investor of the
other Contracting Party, which (2) arises out of (or, in the Claimant’s new translation,

99351

“concerns’”**') an investment. There is no doubt that the first requirement is satisfied.
Euram Bank is an investor of the Republic of Austria, within the meaning of Article
1(2) of the BIT, and it is in dispute with the Slovak Republic. The Respondent
maintains, however, that the second requirement is not satisfied, because, in its view,

the dispute does not arise out of an “investment” as that term is used in the BIT.

“Investment” is defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT and the different translations of that
provision relied upon by the Parties are set out at paragraphs 288 et seg., above. The
definition is in broad terms (the specific assets listed being only examples) and includes
“shares and other forms of participation in enterprises.” However, the Tribunal agrees
with the Respondent that the issue is not what type of asset can constitute an investment

but, rather, what link is required between that asset and the investor.

In the present case, the asset which was allegedly expropriated (or otherwise subjected
to measures inconsistent with the BIT) is the shareholding in Apollo. The investor is
Euram Bank. However, it was not Euram Bank but its subsidiary, EIC, which owned
the shareholding in Apollo. Since EIC is a company incorporated in the Slovak
Republic, it is not an investor which can claim against the Slovak Republic under the
BIT. It follows that, if the BIT required that the asset be owned directly by the

investor, that requirement would not be satisfied in the present case.

The Tribunal is not persuaded, however, that the BIT requires that the investor be the
direct owner of the asset. Article 1(1) makes no reference to ownership. Rather, it
stipulates that “the term ‘investment’ shall mean all assets which an investor of one

Contracting Party invests in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance

55! See Chapter III, above. Nothing turns on the difference between “arise out of” in the Respondent’s translation
and “concerning” in the Claimant’s new translation.

322.

with its legislation.”**

This is broad language which is quite wide enough to
encompass what is today the very common situation of a foreign company making an
investment through a subsidiary incorporated in the host State. In the usage which was
common in relation to investment by the time the BIT was concluded, an investor of
State A which acquired control of a shareholding in a company incorporated in State B
would be described as investing in the territory of State B irrespective of whether it had
purchased the shares in its own name or arranged that they be purchased by a locally
incorporated subsidiary whose decision-making it controlled. In the present case, there
is no doubt that Euram Bank controlled the decisions made by EIC, which was its
100% owned subsidiary.’ Taking the words used in Article 1(1) of the BIT in their
ordinary meaning, therefore, the Tribunal considers that they include the shareholding
in Apollo, notwithstanding that those shares were owned by EIC rather than being

directly owned by Euram Bank.

In the Tribunal’s view, neither the context of those words, nor the object and purpose of
the BIT compel a different conclusion. So far as the context is concerned, both Parties
made extensive reference to Article 4(3) of the BIT (the text of which appears on page
93, above). According to the Respondent, this provision would be unnecessary if assets
held through a subsidiary were included as investments under Article 1(1). On the
Respondent’s interpretation of the BIT, Article 4(3) stands alone as the only provision
concerning indirectly owned assets, a category which Article 4(3) demonstrates is

otherwise outside the scope of the BIT.

The Tribunal does not agree. Article 4(3) has to be seen in the context of Article 4 as a
whole. Article 4(1) provides that a Contracting Party may expropriate (or take similar
measures with regard to) an investment of an investor of the other Contracting Party
only if it pays compensation. Article 4(2) requires that the compensation correspond to
the value of the investment immediately prior to the expropriation. Accordingly, if the
investment in question is a factory, the measure of compensation is the value of that
factory at that time. What Article 4(3) does is to make clear that where the foreign

investor owns not the factory itself but a shareholding (even a very small one) in the

5° Translation RL-40B. The Claimant’s new translation refers to “assets which are invested by an investor of

one Contracting Party.” The Tribunal

s no substantive difference between the two translations.

local company which owns the factory — a company the majority of whose shares may
well be owned by nationals of the expropriating State or other shareholders who could
not qualify as investors under the BIT and who would therefore have no entitlement to
compensation under that Agreement — adequate compensation must nevertheless be
paid to that foreign investor. The term “adequate compensation” in this context would
seem to require that the investor receive a proportion of the value of the asset relative to
the proportion of his shareholding in the local company. The clarification provided by
Article 4(3) in respect of such a case by no means compels the conclusion that assets
held by a local subsidiary of which the investor owns 100% of the shares cannot

constitute an investment under the terms of Article 1(1).

Moreover, the Respondent’s interpretation of Articles 1(1) and 4(3) would produce a
curious result. Only disputes relating to something which qualifies as an investment
under Article 1(1) may be referred to arbitration in accordance with Article 8(1) and
(2). Since the Respondent’s interpretation of Article 4(3) is that it provides for a duty
to compensate notwithstanding that there is no such investment, it would follow that a
dispute regarding the arrangements for payment of compensation under Article 4(3)
would not be subject to arbitration. Yet, as the Tribunal will explain below (at
paragraphs 366-369), Article 4(5) suggests that any dispute regarding the amount of
compensation and the method or conditions of its payment is intended to fall within the

scope of Article 8.

In the Tribunal’s view, the provisions for compensation in Article 4(3) do not suggest a

narrower interpretation of Article 1(1).

With regard to the object and purpose of the BIT, the Tribunal agrees with the
Respondent that the object and purpose of the BIT is not such that it requires provisions
which confer protection upon investors to be given the broadest possible interpretation
in order to further the goal of investment protection. In particular, the Tribunal
considers that it would not be justified in departing from the ordinary meaning of the
terms of a definition provision on the basis that a more expansive definition of
“investment” would further what is only one of the objects of the BIT. In the present
case, however, the Tribunal has already concluded that the ordinary meaning of the

terms used in Article 1(1) encompasses assets invested by an investor of the Republic

of Austria in the territory of the Slovak Republic through a Slovak subsidiary owned by
that investor. There is nothing in the object and purpose of the BIT which would
suggest, let alone require, that the Tribunal accord a narrower interpretation to the

language of Article 1(1).

Turning to the Respondent’s argument concerning customary international law, the
Tribunal considers that this argument is based upon two propositions. The first, which
relies upon the judgments of the International Court of Justice in Barcelona Traction,
ELSI and Diailo,** is that customary international law distinguishes between the assets
of a company and those of its shareholders. The second, which is largely based upon
arbitration awards such as those in Loewen and ADM,** is that rules of customary
international law continue to apply unless a treaty departs from them. The Tribunal
does not consider that the authorities invoked by the Respondent sustain the conclusion
that a dispute about an indirect investment falls outside the scope of the jurisdiction

conferred by Article 8 of the BIT.

The Tribunal accepts that the recent judgments of the International Court of Justice in
Diallo amount to an authoritative reaffirmation of its earlier judgment in Barcelona
Traction. Those judgments were, however, concerned with the extent of the right of
diplomatic protection, where a State brings proceedings to protect one of its nationals.
That was expressly stated by the Court in its 2007 Judgment in Diallo, where it said the

following:

The Court is bound to note that, in contemporary international law, the protection
of the rights of companies and the rights of their shareholders, and the settlement
of the associated disputes, are essentially governed by bilateral or multilateral
agreements for the protection of foreign investments, such as the treaties for the
promotion and protection of foreign investments, and the Washington Convention
of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States, which created an International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID), and also by contracts between States and foreign
investors. In that context, the role of diplomatic protection somewhat faded, as in
practice recourse is only made to it in rare cases where treaty régimes do not exist
or have proved inoperative. It is in this particular and relatively limited context
that the question of protection by substitution might be raised. The theory of
protection by substitution seeks indeed to offer protection to the foreign
shareholders of a company who could not rely on the benefit of an international

treaty and to whom no other remedy is available, the allegedly unlawful acts
having been committed against the company by the State of its nationality.
Protection by “substitution” would therefore appear to constitute the very last
resort for the protection of foreign investments.**°
The 2007 judgment determined that Guinea could not exercise diplomatic protection
with regard to the companies in which Mr Diallo held a controlling interest, because
those companies were incorporated in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In its 2010
judgment in Diallo, the Court went on to hold that, in exercising its right of diplomatic
protection with regard to Mr Diallo, Guinea could not recover in respect of acts which,
though they may have violated obligations owed to the companies, did not amount to

violations of the rights of Mr Diallo as associé.

The Respondent also referred to the judgment of the International Court in ELSI, which
it denied was a case of diplomatic protection. The Tribunal does not believe that this
judgment has any bearing on the issues in the present case. Since it was an action
brought by the United States on behalf of two United States companies,**’ albeit by
reference to a Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaty, it was a diplomatic
protection case. Moreover, it did not turn on questions relating to indirect investment
but was concerned with the application of the local remedies rule and the scope of

protection under the treaty, neither of which issues is relevant to the present case.

The Tribunal is not concerned with the “particular and relatively limited context” of
diplomatic protection. The issue in the present case is not whether Austria may
exercise a right of diplomatic protection with regard to the alleged expropriation of
EIC’s shareholding in Apollo, nor whether, if Austria exercised its right of diplomatic
protection with regard to Euram Bank, it could recover damages in respect of the
alleged expropriation of that shareholding. The issue in the present case is whether that
shareholding falls within the definition of “investment” in the BIT. The BIT constitutes

lex specialis in that regard.

Nor does the Tribunal find the passages in the Loewen and ADM awards on which the

Respondent relied to be relevant to the present case. Those awards (like the judgment

556 Diallo, supra note 314, 488 (emphasis added).

357

ELSI, supra note 315, 51.

in ELSI) show that where a treaty is silent on a subject it cannot be presumed to have
departed from an established rule of customary international law such as the local
remedies rule (ELS) or the doctrine of continuing nationality (Loewen). But that is not
the case here. The BIT creates a right of action for an investor which would not exist
under customary international law. It does so in respect of disputes about
“investments”, a term which the BIT defines in some detail in Article 1(1). There is no
general rule of customary international law which would normally be applicable in this

situation and on which the BIT is silent.

333. The Tribunal will next turn to the question of the travaux préparatoires of the BIT. In
view of the Tribunal’s findings regarding the meaning of Article 1(1), it has doubts
about whether this is a case in which recourse to the travaux préparatoires is
appropriate under Article 32 VCLT.** The Tribunal considers, however, that, even if it
were to have recourse to the travaux préparatoires of the BIT, doing so would not
affect the outcome. The Tribunal finds nothing in the travaux préparatoires which
have been put before it that compels the conclusion that the States Parties intended that
the BIT should define investment so as to exclude indirectly owned investments of the
kind at issue in the present case. The Respondent relied upon a brief statement in a
Report submitted to the Government of the then CSFR by its Ministry of Finance to the
effect that the proposed agreement with Austria “specifies the terms ‘investment’ and
‘investor’ in connection with their participation in the business in the territory of one of

> 359

the Contractual Parties’ This statement reveals nothing about the manner of that

participation nor about whether it had to be direct or could be made through a locally

incorporated subsidiary.

*8 ‘The tribunal in Methanex v. United States considering the 1966 Report of the International Law Commission

to the General Assembly stressed the limited relevance of the negotiating history in the light of Article 31 of the
VCLT:

[...] pursuant to Article 32, recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation only in the
limited circumstances there specified. Other than that, the approach of the Vienna Convention is that the
text of the treaty is deemed to be the authentic expression of the intentions of the parties; and its
elucidation, rather than wide-ranging searches for the supposed intentions of the partie:

334. The Tribunal is aware that the tribunal in HICEE B.V. v. Slovak Republic, a case which

335.

336.

360

was also concerned with the Slovak Republic’s change to the law regarding health
insurers and related to that part of the shares in Apollo which was not held by EIC,
relied on the travaux préparatoires of the Netherlands-CSFR BIT in arriving at the
conclusion that indirectly owned assets did not fall within the definition of investment
in that treaty. Despite the similarity between the underlying facts of that case and the
present proceedings, however, the legal materials are quite different. Not only was the
relevant provision of the Netherlands-CSFR BIT in different terms from those of the
BIT at issue here (a matter to which the Tribunal will return below), the travaux
presented to the HICEE tribunal contained a passage which was far more explicit than

that quoted in the preceding paragraph.

The HICEE tribunal relied upon the following passage in the Explanatory Note
submitted by the Dutch Government to the Parliament of the Netherlands regarding the
proposed BIT between the Netherlands and the CSFR:

The Agreement covers direct investments and investments made through a
company in a third country. Normally, investment protection agreements also
cover investments in the host country made by a Dutch company’s subsidiary
which is already established in the host country (‘“subsidiary’-“sub-subsidiary”
structure). Czechoslovakia wishes to exclude the “sub-subsidiary” from the scope
of this Agreement, because this is in fact a company created by a Czechoslovakian
legal entity, and Czechoslovakia does not want to grant, in particular, transfer
rights to such company. This restriction can be dealt with by incorporating a new
company directly from the Netherlands. As the restriction is therefore not of great
practical importance, the Dutch delegation has consented to it.

There is no statement of similar clarity in the travaux of the Austria-CSFR BIT with

which the present case is concerned.

Nor does the Tribunal find the practice in respect of other treaties relied upon by the
Respondent to be of any assistance. The fact that the Slovak Republic (and its
predecessor States) was concerned to limit the scope of investments covered in other
treaties and inserted restrictive language to that effect (as was done in the Netherlands

BIT) serves, if anything, to highlight the absence of such restrictive language in the

HICEE, supra note 308, 438.

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction

Page 112 of 160

present BIT. The practice of other States seems to the Tribunal to shed no light

whatsoever upon the intention of the States Parties to the present BIT.

337. The Tribunal has considered the way in which the issue of indirect ownership has been
dealt with by other arbitral tribunals. In this context, both Parties invoked awards
which they considered supported their favoured interpretation. The Tribunal believes
that such awards have to be approached with a degree of caution. In several instances,
the BIT under consideration used language which was different from that of the present
BIT and the award is, therefore, of no assistance. For example, the award in HICEE, on
which the Respondent relied, concerned a clause which was very similar to Article 1(1)
of the current BIT in defining “investment”, except that it included a provision that the
asset had to be “invested either directly or through an investor of a third State.” Given
that language, it is not surprising that the tribunal held that a structure similar to the one
employed by Euram Bank and EIC in the present case was excluded, since the asset in
question was invested neither directly nor through an investor of a third State.*’ Article
1(1) of the present BIT, however, contains no statement that the asset in question must
be “invested either directly or through an investor of a third State.” Conversely, a
number of the awards relied upon by the Claimant concerned BITs which expressly
included indirectly owned assets within their definition of investment, whereas no such

provision appears in the present BIT.

338. The Tribunal notes, however, that in a number of cases tribunals confronted with
clauses similar to that in the present case have held that they include indirectly owned
assets. For example, in Siemens v. Argentina, the BIT between Germany and Argentina

defined “investment” as

all kinds of assets in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in the
territory of which the capital investment is made in accordance with this treaty, in
particular, but not exclusively [...] (b) shares of corporate stock, shares in companies and
other kinds of participations in companies.*”

56! Berschader, supra note 309, on which the Respondent relied, also contained an express provision regarding
investment made through a company incorporated in a third State. The tribunal there concluded that an
investment made through a company incorporated in the State of nationality of the claimant, but which was not
a party to the proceedings, was excluded.

Page 113 of 160

The tribunal came to the conclusion that “the quality of a direct dispute is not affected

by Siemens not being the direct shareholder of the local company.”*

In considering the scope of a similar clause, the tribunal in Mobil Corporation v.

Venezuela stated the matter even more clearly:

The Tribunal notes that there is no explicit reference to direct or indirect investments in
the BIT. The definition of investment given in Article | is very broad. It includes “every
kind of assets” and enumerates specific categories of investments as examples. One of
those categories consists of “shares, bonds or other kinds of interests in companies and
joint ventures”. The plain meaning of this provision is that shares or other kind of
interests held by Dutch shareholders in a company or in a joint venture having made
investment on Venezuelan territory are protected under Article 1. The BIT does not
require that there be no interposed companies between the ultimate owner of the company
or of the joint venture and the investment. Therefore, a literal reading of the BIT does not
support the allegation that the definition of investment excludes indirect investments.***

The tribunals in Cemex Caracas v. Venezuela, Ioannis Karadassopoulos v. Georgia,
Tza Yap Shum vy. Peru and Mobil v. Venezuela also dealt with the coverage of indirect
investments by applying a broad investment definition within the respective BITs. The
tribunals all came to similar conclusions, namely that indirect investments were
covered by the respective clauses. The Tribunal considers that these awards serve to

confirm the conclusion it had already reached regarding the interpretation of Article

1(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection.

V. THIRD OBJECTION: THE SCOPE OF ARTICLE 8

The Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection is that the Claimant’s claims under
Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT fall outside the scope of Article 8, from which the Tribunal
derives its jurisdiction. The Respondent’s submissions and the Claimant’s response

thereto raise three issues which the Tribunal will address separately.

First, the Respondent argues that the terms of Article 8 limit jurisdiction to two types of
dispute: (a) those regarding the amount, or conditions of payment, of compensation in
the case of expropriation or similar measures under Article 4, and (b) those concerning
the right to free transfers under Article 5. The Respondent therefore contends that the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in the present case with regard to the claims under Article 4,
since the dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent is not over the amount or
conditions of payment of compensation for expropriation but concerns the more
fundamental question whether there has been an expropriation, or similar measure.
According to the Respondent, Article 8 does not confer jurisdiction over that question.
The Respondent also maintains that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims
under Article 2 for alleged breaches of the obligation to accord fair and equitable
treatment, since disputes over that obligation are not mentioned in Article 8. The
Respondent accepts that this third jurisdictional objection does not apply to the claims
under Article 5 of the BIT. The Claimant disputes the Respondent’s interpretation of
Article 8, so far as it concerns its claims under Article 4 of the BIT (although it accepts
that its claims under Article 2 fall outside the terms of Article 8 if those terms are

considered in isolation). This issue is addressed in Part A, below.

Secondly, the Claimant raises a separate issue by contending that, even if the
Respondent’s interpretation of Article 8 is correct, the Constitutional Court of the
Slovak Republic has already decided, in its judgment of 24 March 2011, that the
shareholding in Apollo was the subject of expropriation or similar measures falling
within Article 4(1). Consequently, it contends that the way is clear for the Tribunal to
exercise jurisdiction under Article 8 to decide the dispute regarding compensation for
what has already been established as an expropriation. The Respondent disputes the

Claimant’s analysis of the meaning and effect of the judgment of the Constitutional

345.

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Award on Jurisdiction

22 October 2012

Page 115 of 160

Court. This argument does not affect the claims under Article 2. The judgment of the

Constitutional Court is considered in Part B, below.

Finally, the Claimant maintains that, even if the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s
interpretation of Article 8 and rejects the Claimant’s argument regarding the judgment
of the Constitutional Court, its jurisdiction is nevertheless established. According to the
Claimant, the effect of the most favoured nation (“MFN”) clause in Article 3 of the
BIT is that the Claimant may take advantage of the broader jurisdictional provisions in
other BITs concluded by the Slovak Republic and its predecessor State. On this basis,
the Claimant maintains that the Tribunal has jurisdiction not only over its Article 4
claims but also over its claims under Article 2 of the BIT. The MEN issue is addressed

in Part C, below.

A. THE INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 8

1. The Positions of the Parties

(1) The Respondent

346.

347.

The Respondent bases its argument that the Claimant’s claims for violation of Articles
2 and 4 of the Treaty do not fall within the scope of Article 8 of the Treaty on the “text,
context, object and purpose, and the circumstances of the conclusion and the

99365

preparatory work of the Treaty. According to the Respondent, Article 8 is “plain on
its face” and demonstrates that Slovakia has not agreed to arbitrate claims under Article
4, except in respect of the amount, or conditions of payment, of compensation, or any

matter under Article 2.°

The Respondent asserts that Article 8 of the BIT confers jurisdiction only with respect
to disputes “concerning the amount or the conditions of payment of a compensation
pursuant to Article 4, or the transfer obligations pursuant to Article 5.°°°’ According to
the Respondent, the use of the word “concerning” shows that expropriation claims are
39368

confined to the issue of the “amount or the conditions of payment of a compensation’

and excludes the questions whether there has been an expropriation or other similar

measure and, if so, whether that measure was contrary to the requirements of Article

4(1) regarding matters other than compensation.*”

According to the Respondent, the
finding of whether an expropriation has occurred and the finding of the amount of

compensation are divisible and can be reviewed separately.*”

According to the Respondent, this interpretation of Article 8 is strengthened when the
provision is viewed in the context of the other provisions of the BIT, in particular, the
title of Article 4 and the text of Article 4(4) and 4(5). The Respondent contends that
Article 4(4) and 4(5) establish a “division of responsibility.”*"! Article 4(4) permits a
claimant to litigate the “legitimacy/legality” of an expropriation in the Slovak courts,
but “does not contemplate access to an arbitral tribunal for a determination of

lawfulness.”*”

Article 4(5) allows an arbitral tribunal to review “the amount of
compensation and conditions of payment”, but nothing in Article 4(5) “suggests that
arbitral review may go beyond ‘the amount of the compensation and conditions of
payment’.”*”? The Respondent also places reliance on the phrase “pursuant to Article
4” in Article 8(1), which, it contends, ties the grant of jurisdiction under Article 8 to the
division of responsibility laid down in Article 4(4) and 4(5). The Respondent notes that
the decision of the Austrian Airlines tribunal “unreservedly, and unanimously endorsed

the above textual analysis.”*”*

Pointing to the VCLT, the Respondent argues that the object and purpose of the Treaty

and the travaux préparatoires further deny the existence of consent to the arbitration of

375

expropriation claims.” The Respondent considers that the Treaty’s preamble is narrow

as compared with other BITs,*”

and in any event notes that “the object and purpose
cannot be used to add words to the text of the Treaty.”*” Additionally, the Respondent

cites a previous draft of Article 8(2) to point out that the Contracting Parties restricted

the scope from “related claims” to “specified claims.”*”* According to the Respondent,
this indicates a “deliberateness in narrowing the jurisdictional clause” and “reflects an

undeniable intention not to extend jurisdiction beyond the limited scope of the text of

Article 8.°”

According to the Respondent, the States Parties’ compliance with Article 4(4), and the

Claimant’s arguments regarding the effectiveness of the Slovak Courts is not relevant

to interpreting Article 8(1).*° The Respondent argues that even if compliance with
Article 4(4) were relevant, the Claimant has not met the burden of demonstrating non-

compliance.**' The Respondent points to several remedies available to the Claimant

under Slovak law that “allow foreign investors to obtain a determination that an

expropriation has occurred within the meaning of the Treaty.”**”

According to the
Respondent, the Slovak Constitution enables foreign investors to bring their claims, and
the courts of general jurisdiction would entertain four different actions under national

statutes.**

The Respondent also refers to the fact that the Claimant has initiated
proceedings before the District Court of Bratislava, thus demonstrating that it considers

there are remedies available to it under the laws of Slovakia.

(2) The Claimant

351.

The Claimant begins by noting that its case under Article 4 is that its investment was
the subject of indirect expropriation. In arguing that the Treaty covers more than just
disputes over the amount of compensation, the Claimant takes issue with the
Respondent’s translation of Article 8(1) of the BIT.*** The Claimant argues that the
correct translation, as set out in the translation which it filed after the hearing, does not
contain the words “pursuant to.” For the Claimant, while “the use of the words ‘the

amount ... of (a) compensation’ seemingly limits the scope of the arbitration, [t]he

words ‘concerning’ or ‘with regard to’, however, are broad. In particular, the

Claimant takes issue with the Respondent’s characterisation of “concerning” as a

narrowing term similar to “about.”***

The Claimant argues that the ordinary meaning of the words in Article 8 and the cross-
references made to Article 4 demonstrate that jurisdiction is not confined to disputes
over the amount of compensation.**’ Instead, the Claimant submits, the Tribunal is
empowered to consider whether an event enumerated in Article 4(1) of the BIT has
occurred and its precise nature. The contrary conclusion would deprive Article 8 of the
BIT of purpose and meaning since then “[a] state could defeat investment arbitration
merely by asserting that no expropriation had taken place and that would be the end of

the matter for any investor and tribunal.’”***

The Claimant also disputes the relevance of Article 4(4) of the BIT for the
interpretation of Article 8 of the Treaty. While Article 4(1) of the BIT covers
“nationalization” and other “measures having similar consequences” as well as
“expropriation”, Article 4(4) only mentions “expropriation”. The Claimant’s claims,
which arise inter alia from “measures having similar consequences”, thus fall within
the ambit of Article 8 of the BIT, which refers generally to all compensable events
under Article 4 but are not encompassed by Article 4(4), which deals only with

“expropriation.”*”

Furthermore, the Claimant argues that Articles 4(4) and (5) of the BIT provide for a
right to domestic court review, but “the fact that the Treaty contains a specific right to
challenge some aspects of expropriation before national authorities does not imply that
this presents a system according to which some disputes should be settled before

national authorities and others before international arbitration.”*””

According to the Claimant, this interpretation is consistent with the cases of EMV,

Renta 4, Sedelmayer v. Russian Federation, Telenor v. Hungary, and Tza Yap Shum v.

Republic of Peru, in which tribunals either found that they had jurisdiction in situations
with narrow BITs, or at least interpreted similar BITs to allow a tribunal to consider not

just compensation claims but also expropriation claims.*”

The Claimant advances that since the “(indirect) expropriation” effected by
Amendment I is “manifestly illegal”, there is nothing in Article 4(4) to be reviewed for
legality.** The Claimant argues that it is generally accepted that the legality of
expropriation is conditioned on four requirements, which must be fulfilled cumulatively

13%

in order for an expropriation to be lega The expropriatory measure must: (i) serve a

public purpose, (ii) not be arbitrary or discriminatory, (iii) follow principles of due

process, and (iv) provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation."

Regarding
compensation, the Claimant notes that the Respondent “does not even attempt to say it
has offered compensation and the fact that no compensation has been offered is

confirmed by the Constitutional Court in its judgment dated 26 January 2011.”

The Claimant argues that due process was not fulfilled since “there was also no
‘reasonable advance notice’ to Euram Bank, no ‘fair hearing’ in front of an ‘unbiased
and impartial adjudicator’ (or at all) and no procedure that was ‘meaningful’ to the
investor.** The Claimant further asserts that if Article 4(4) is to be interpreted as
argued by the Respondent and confers exclusive jurisdiction on the Slovak courts, the
burden then falls on the Respondent “to show that it has put in place suitable effective
legal mechanisms domestically that allow an investor a meaningful pursuit of the right
to have the legality of the expropriation reviewed as provided for in Article 4(4) of the
Treaty.’ The Claimant advances that the Tribunal “need not look further than to the

undeniable fact that no compensation has been offered. This finding alone suffices to

establish the illegality of the indirect expropriation on the level of international and

treaty law.

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that there are remedies available to
the Claimant to pursue its claim other than through international arbitration under the
Treaty.*” Arguing that the burden of proof to demonstrate the availability of other
options is on the Respondent, the Claimant advances that the Slovak courts of general
jurisdiction have no jurisdiction over this matter and that there is no effective protection

available to the investor before Slovak authorities.

The Claimant responds to the Respondent’s suggestion that an investor could seek
protection of its rights before Slovak courts through an action based on Act No.
514/2003 Coll. on Liability for Damages caused by the Exercise of Public Authority.”
The Claimant argues that this can only be relied on when damage is caused “to an
individual or legal entity by an organ or representative of the State within individual
proceedings,” but does not provide for a remedy to an investor when the damage is

caused by an act of Parliament.*"'

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis
In accordance with the principles already set out (in paragraphs 315-317, above), the
Tribunal begins by considering the “ordinary meaning” of the terms used in Article 8 of

the BIT. In doing so, it focuses only on the treatment of disputes regarding Article 4 of

8 Thid., [293.

the BIT, since it is common ground that disputes regarding Article 5 claims are within

the scope of the provision.“

The critical words are those in Article 8(1) which define the type of dispute over which
Article 8(2) gives an arbitration tribunal jurisdiction. According to the Respondent’s
translation,*“ Article 8(1) requires that the dispute must be one “concerning the amount
or the conditions of payment of a compensation pursuant to Article 4.” The Claimant’s
post-hearing translation is that the dispute must be one “with regard to the amount or

the arrangements for payment of compensation in accordance with Article 4.”

The words used in this part of Article 8(1) clearly limit the scope of that provision,
which is thus rendered far more restrictive than the disputes clauses found in many
BITs. The Parties are agreed on that much and the Claimant does not suggest, for
example, that the wording of Article 8(1) could embrace its claim for a violation of
Article 2 of the BIT unless the Tribunal accepts its MFN argument. Unless it is to be
read as modified by the effect of the MFN provision, Article 8(1) plainly confines the
Tribunal to disputes regarding Articles 4 and 5. The question, however, is whether it is
more restrictive than that and denies the Tribunal jurisdiction to determine whether

there has been an expropriation or other act falling within Article 4(1).

The Tribunal does not consider that any significance attaches, for present purposes, to
the differences between the translations proffered by the Parties and set out at page 95,
above. Whether the provision is correctly translated as referring to “conditions of
payment” or “arrangements for payment” has no relevance to the issue before the
Tribunal. Nor does the question whether the indefinite article should appear before the
word “compensation.” The other two differences require a little more attention. The
Respondent places some reliance on the word “concerning”, arguing that it has a
limitative effect. However, the Tribunal considers that it is no more (and no less)
limiting than “with regard to” and that the two expressions are, for practical purposes,
synonymous in the present context. It has come to the same conclusion regarding the

terms “pursuant to” and “in accordance with”.

The Tribunal considers that, even if it treats as definitive the most recent translation
offered by the Claimant, the interpretation advanced by the Respondent more
accurately reflects the ordinary meaning of the words used. According to the
Claimant’s translation, Article 8(1) gives jurisdiction only over a dispute “with regard
to the amount or the arrangements for payment of compensation pursuant to Article 4.”
The language is narrow and specific. It is in marked contrast to the equivalent
provision in the BIT concluded only eighteen months earlier between the Belgian-
Luxembourg Economic Union and the CSFR, which was considered by the tribunal in
the case of EMV v. Czech Republic (the award in which is discussed below). Article 8
of that BIT provided for an arbitral tribunal to have jurisdiction over disputes
“concerning compensation due by virtue of” the provisions equivalent to those of
Article 4 of the present treaty. That provision was held to confer jurisdiction over the
issue whether an expropriation or similar measure had occurred so as to give rise to a
right to compensation. Article 8(1) of the present treaty specifies that the dispute must
be about not simply “compensation” but “the amount or the arrangements for payment
of compensation.” If the intention had been to confer upon an arbitral tribunal
established under Article 8 the jurisdiction to determine whether there was any
entitlement to compensation at all, it is difficult to see why the words “the amount or
the arrangements for payment” were included; the Claimant’s interpretation of Article
8(1) effectively renders those words redundant and, in doing so, runs counter to the
principle of treaty interpretation that all words used should, if possible, be given

meaning.

The Claimant and the Respondent also differ over whether the words “in accordance
with Article 4” qualify the term “compensation” or the whole phrase “the amount or the
arrangements for payment of compensation.” The Claimant argues that the
qualification relates to the word “compensation” and thus directs the reader to the basic
entitlement to compensation in Article 4(1), which, so the Claimant contends, means
that an Article 8 tribunal is given jurisdiction to rule on whether or not the conditions in
Article 4(1) have been met. The Respondent argues that the qualifying words refer to
the whole phrase “the amount or the arrangements for payment of compensation”. The
Tribunal finds the Respondent’s analysis more persuasive. The structure of Article 8(1)

is such that the phrase “in accordance with Article 4” would most naturally be seen as

367.

368.

405

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction

Page 123 of 160

referring to the whole of what precedes it; there is no grammatical or logical reason for
singling out the word “compensation” from the remainder of the phrase in which it

appears.

The Claimant further contends that “in accordance with” should be given the same
meaning as “due by virtue of’. As the arbitral tribunal in Renta 4 v. Russian
Federation (an award on which the Claimant relied) said, the latter phrase necessarily
raises the question “who determines whether compensation is indeed ‘due’.”“’* The
Tribunal is not persuaded that the two phrases carry the same meaning. To say that
compensation is due by virtue of a provision is a clear reference to the existence of an
entitlement to compensation derived from that provision. The term “in accordance
with” does not have the same clear reference to entitlement; it is more commonly used
as synonymous with “pursuant to” or “according to” (the other translations offered in
respect of this part of Article 8(1)) and thus acts in large part as a cross-reference. In
the context of the present BIT, the phrase “in accordance with Article 4” also seems
more naturally to tie the provisions of Article 8(1) in with those of Article 4(5), which
provides (again using the Claimant’s latest translation) as follows:
The investor shall have the right to have the amount of the compensation and the
method of payment reviewed either by the competent authorities of the
Contracting Party which prompted the expropriation or by an arbitral tribunal in
accordance with Article 8 of this Agreement. (Emphasis added)
The Tribunal considers that the italicised words and the use in Article 8(1) of the phrase
“in accordance with Article 4” were intended to create a close relationship between the
two provisions. Under that relationship, the only type of dispute regarding Article 4 in
respect of which Article 8 confers jurisdiction upon an arbitration tribunal is the type of
dispute which Article 4 expressly provides may be referred to such a tribunal, i.e. those

contemplated by Article 4(5).

Article 31(1) of the VCLT requires that the terms of a treaty be interpreted in their
context. In the present case, the most important part of the context of Article 8 is
Article 4, to which Article 8(1) makes express reference. The Tribunal has already

considered several aspects of Article 4, but one more requires attention. Article 4(4)

Renta 4, supra note 391, §27.

370.

4°6 The Respondent’s tran:

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction
22 October 2012

Page 124 of 160

provides that an investor shall have the right to have the “legality’"”°

of an expropriation
reviewed by the national authorities; no reference is made to review of that question by
any other body. By contrast, Article 4(5), as has already been seen, gives the investor
the right to have the amount of compensation and the arrangements for paying it
reviewed by either the national authorities or an Article 8 tribunal. According to the
Respondent, Article 4(4) and 4(5), read together, confirm the comparatively limited
role which the Parties to the BIT intended to give to an arbitral tribunal established

under Article 8.

The Claimant seeks to counter this apparent effect of Article 4(4) and 4(5) in a number
of ways. First, it maintains that Article 4(4) applies only to “expropriation” and not to
the other types of measure referred to in Article 4(1). It sees that fact as possessing
particular significance, because its argument on the merits is that the present case is one
of indirect taking and not of classic “expropriation.” The Tribunal does not agree that
Article 4(4) is limited in the way suggested by the Claimant. It notes that the
Respondent’s translation of Article 4(1) refers to “expropriation measures, including
nationalization or other measures having the same consequences.” Whether that is in
fact a more accurate rendition into English of the authentic texts of Article 4(1), it
undoubtedly reflects the overall approach of Article 4. The terms “expropriation” or
“expropriation measures” are used in paragraphs (2) to (5) of Article 4 in such a way
that they are plainly intended to encompass all of the types of measures referred to in
Article 4(1). Thus, the provisions for the amount and arrangements for payment of
compensation in Article 4(2) are applicable to all “expropriation measures.” If the
Claimant’s analysis were correct, then neither Article 4(2) nor Article 4(3) (a provision
on which the Claimant relies in other parts of its argument) would be applicable to the

type of measure of which it claims to have been the victim.

Secondly, the Claimant maintains that Article 4(4) is intended to apply only to
measures taken with regard to specific property under powers granted by a statute or
similar legislation of general application and not to a measure which is itself legislative

in form (as was the case with Amendment I). The Tribunal can see nothing in the text

 

tion refers to “legitimacy.” The Tribunal does not consider that the difference

 

between these two terms has any significance for the issues currently under consideration.

372.

373.

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Page 125 of 160

of Article 4 to support, let alone compel, such an interpretation. Nor does the Tribunal
agree that considerations of logic compel it to read such a limitation into the provision.
There is no reason in principle why States should not agree that the legality of any type
of expropriation measure (including a legislative one) could be reviewed by the

competent national authorities.

Lastly, the Claimant contends that Article 4(4) lacks the significance which the
Respondent attributes to it, because it provides only for the right to have the legality of
the expropriation reviewed and does not make any provision for the national authorities
to review the question whether or not an expropriation has occurred. In the Claimant’s
view, the question whether there has been an expropriation or comparable measure has
to be determined by an arbitral tribunal, even though the question whether or not that
measure is lawful is reserved to the relevant national authorities. The Tribunal agrees
with the Respondent that this analysis is unrealistic and is unsupported by the text of
Article 4(4) and 4(5). The power to determine whether an expropriation or comparable
measure is lawful is a far more extensive power than is the power to determine the
amount of compensation to be paid (or the arrangement for the payment of that
compensation) in respect of such a measure. It is also one which, in any case in which
legality is contested, must necessarily be exercised first. The idea that an investor
might go to an Article 8 tribunal for the determination of whether there had been an
expropriation, then to the national authorities for review of the legality of that
expropriation and, finally, back to an Article 8 tribunal for the assessment of the

amount of compensation is far too cumbersome to be plausible.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Article 4(4) and 4(5) provide for a
division of responsibility. Article 4(4) reserves disputes about the principle of
expropriation to the national authorities, while the amount of compensation and the
arrangements for payment of compensation can be referred to the national authorities or

to an arbitration tribunal under Article 8.

Both Parties referred to a number of arbitration awards which they invoked in support
of their respective interpretations of Articles 4 and 8 of the BIT. The Tribunal has
examined these awards with care. While it accepts that they offer some assistance, the

Tribunal considers that a degree of caution is called for in relying upon them. It is not

374.

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Page 126 of 160

simply that there is no doctrine of binding precedent in international law; most of the
awards invoked by the Parties concerned the jurisdictional provisions of other BITs
which use different terms from those employed in the present BIT. As such,
expressions of opinion about the meaning of those terms are only indirectly relevant to

the interpretation of the present BIT.

The exception is the award of the tribunal in Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic,

which concerned the same BIT as that in the present case. The tribunal in that case

407

unanimously*” concluded that the ordinary meaning of the words used in Article 8 of

the BIT meant that jurisdiction was “limited to disputes about the amount of the
compensation and does not extend to review of the principles of expropriation.” It
found that such an interpretation was confirmed by the provisions of Article 4(4) and

4(5) which it considered provided that

Claims about the principle of expropriation are for the local authorities under
Article 4(4) and claims about the amount of compensation are for the local
authorities or for an arbitral tribunal under Articles 4(5) and 8. In the second case,
the investor has a choice of means. In the first one, he has no choice of means.
His choice is limited to whether to challenge the principle of expropriation or not.
If he decides to challenge it, he must do so before the local authorities. The
ordinary meaning of Article 4(4) and 4(5) is plain.“”

The tribunal rejected an argument that this conclusion was contrary to the object and

purpose of the BIT:

In assessing the scope of Article 8 of the Treaty in the light of the Treaty’s object
and purpose, the Tribunal cannot ignore the investment protection regime set up by
the Contracting States. Here they have in particular agreed that an investor may
challenge the legality of an expropriation but only before the local authorities. The
observation that they did not provide for arbitration on every aspect of all treaty
breaches cannot be deemed to be contrary to the Treaty’s object and purpose of
protecting investment. It all depends on the protection contracted for. Otherwise
the provisions of an investment protection treaty (without or) with limited access
to arbitration would necessarily have to be viewed as contrary to the object and
purpose of that treaty consisting inter alia in protecting investment.""”

The tribunal in Austrian Airlines thus analysed the relevant provisions of the BIT in

exactly the same way as the present Tribunal has done.

375. EMV v. Czech Republic was relied upon by both Parties. That case concerned the 1989
BIT between the Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union and the Czechoslovak
Socialist Republic. Article 8 of that BIT provided that an arbitration tribunal would
have jurisdiction over “disputes ... concerning compensation due by virtue of Article 3

paragraphs (1) and (3).” Article 3(1) provided that

Investments made by investors of one of the Contracting Parties in the territory of
the other Contracting Party may not be expropriated or subjected to other measures
of direct or indirect dispossession, total or partial, having a similar effect, unless
such measures are

(a) taken in accordance with a lawful procedure and are not discriminatory;

(b) accompanied by provisions for the payment of compensation, which shall be
paid to the investors in convertible currency and without delay. The amount shall
correspond to the real value of the investments on the day before the measures
were taken or made public.""’

The EMV tribunal rejected an argument similar to that advanced by the Respondent in
the present case and held that the jurisdiction conferred by Article 8 of the Belgium-
Luxembourg-CSR BIT included jurisdiction to determine whether an expropriation or

other measure within the meaning of Article 3(1) had taken place. It stated that

In the absence of a clear provision for these issues to be determined in some other
forum these determinations must be made by the tribunal which is determining the
amount of compensation payable or the system of investment protection created by
the Treaty will be rendered wholly ineffective.‘

However, the tribunal expressly compared the provisions in the BIT which it had to

apply with those of the BIT at issue in the present case:

The above conclusion is supported by the fact that the treaty is silent as to where
and how the issues of expropriation and dispossession are to be determined. The
Respondent has suggested that this could be in the local courts or under inter-State
arbitration under Article 7 of the treaty. However, these solutions are neither
practicable nor expressly intended by the Treaty.

French; the quotation is from a translation used by the tribunal which appears to have been agreed between the
arties.

One can presume that a foreign investor will not generally seek redress for the

action of a government expropriating it or dispossessing it of its property in the

local courts unless that is expressly provided in the BIT (as is the case in the BIT

between Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic).'*
The tribunal went on to say that, if it had been the intention and policy of the
Czechoslovak Government at the time of negotiating the BIT to exclude the question
whether there had been an expropriation justifying compensation from an Article 8
tribunal, “it could and should have expressly provided how all issues prior to the
question of compensation were to be determined, i.e. local courts or international
tribunal, and then to provide separately for how compensation was to be resolved if not

agreed.”"!4

Taken as a whole, therefore, the analysis of the EMV tribunal tends to support the
arguments of the Respondent in the present arbitration. Article 4(4) of the present BIT
contains precisely the express provision as to how all issues prior to the question of
compensation were to be resolved. Moreover, the tribunal referred to the present BIT,
by way of comparison with the treaty it had to construe, in such a way as to suggest that

the answer would have been different under the present BIT.

“'S before which

That conclusion is reinforced by the analysis of the English High Court,
the award was challenged under a provision in the United Kingdom’s Arbitration Act
which required the Court to rehear the question of jurisdiction.’ The High Court
concluded that the tribunal had been right in finding that it had jurisdiction. In reaching
that conclusion, however, the judge, Simon J, emphasised two features of the Belgium-
Luxembourg BIT which are absent from the present BIT. First, he held that the phrase
“concerning compensation” could not, as a matter of the ordinary meaning of the words
used, be read to mean only “relating to the amount of compensation”.*"’ In the present
case, however, the phrase used in Article 8(1) is “with regard to the amount or the
arrangements for payment of compensation”. Secondly, Simon J emphasised that the

phrase “due by virtue of” in Article 8 of the BIT at issue in the case before him

“connects entitlement to compensation to events specified in Articles 3(1) and (3).

That phrase is noticeably absent from Article 8 of the present BIT.

The Respondent’s case is also supported by RosInvest v. Russian Federation." That
case arose under the 1989 UK-USSR BIT, the jurisdictional provision of which
provided (in the English text) that
This Article shall apply to any legal disputes between an investor of one
Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party in relation to an investment of
the former either concerning the amount or payment of compensation under
Articles 4 or 5 of this Agreement, or concerning any other matter consequential
upon an act of expropriation in accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement, or
concerning the consequences of the non-implementation, or of the incorrect
implementation, of Article 6 of this Agreement.”
The text was thus similar to that in Article 8(1) of the present BIT in expressly referring
to the “amount” of compensation and in not employing the phrase “due by virtue of”.
On the other hand, there was no equivalent of Article 4(4) and (5). The tribunal
unanimously concluded*! that the clause quoted above did not confer jurisdiction to
determine whether there had been an expropriation. It considered that a grant of
jurisdiction to determine a dispute regarding the “amount of compensation” did not
extend to determining whether there had been an act giving rise to an entitlement to

compensation."

On the other hand, the Claimant’s case derives some support from the award in Renta 4
vy. Russian Federation. The relevant BIT in that case was the 1991 BIT between Spain
and the Russian Federation, Article 10 of which conferred jurisdiction with regard to
“any dispute ... relating to the amount or method of payment of the compensation due
under Article 6 of this Agreement.” Article 6 provided that

consequences taken by the authorities of either Party against investments made

within its territory by investors of the other Party, shall be taken only on the
grounds of public use and in accordance with the legislation in force in the
territory. Such measures should on no account be discriminatory. The Party
adopting such measures shall pay the investor or his beneficiary adequate
compensation, without undue delay and in freely convertible currency.
The tribunal unanimously concluded that it had jurisdiction over whether an
expropriation or similar measure within the meaning of Article 6 had taken place. The
award is closely reasoned and contains an important critique of the award in Ros/nvest.
It also examines in greater detail than any of the other awards cited by the Parties the
practical difficulties to which a jurisdiction limited to determining the amount or
method of payment of compensation could give rise. For a number of reasons,
however, the Tribunal is not persuaded that the award in Renta 4 should lead it to

accept the Claimant’s arguments in the present case.

First, the wording of Article 10 of the Spain-Russian Federation BIT differs in an
important respect from that of Article 8 of the BIT in the present case. It is true that
both provisions expressly refer to the “amount” and the “method of payment” (or in the
present BIT, the “arrangements for payment”), unlike the BIT at issue in the EMV case.
Nevertheless, the Renta 4 tribunal was faced with a clause which conferred jurisdiction
over disputes “relating to the amount or method of payment of the compensation due
under Article 6 of this Agreement.” Article 8 of the present BIT does not use the
phrase “due under” or “due by virtue of” but rather uses the phrase “in accordance
with”. The Tribunal has already referred to the significance it attaches to that phrase (a
significance also mentioned by the High Court in EMV). The Renta 4 tribunal itself

considered the phrase to be significant.”

Secondly, the BIT under consideration in Renta 4 contained no equivalent of Article
4(4) and 4(5) of the present BIT. The significance of that point is thrown into sharp
relief by paragraphs 58 and 59 of the Renta 4 award. Having noted what it saw as the
unsatisfactory consequences of a provision leaving the question whether there had been
an expropriation to be determined by the national courts of the respondent State, the

Renta 4 tribunal went on to say

3 See, e.g., Renta 4, supra note 391, 4931, 35.

383.

384.

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Page 131 of 160

The present Tribunal does not deny that such a provision could be given effect if
such was the clear import of the Treaty. Article 6 might have explained how
entitlement is to be determined. Article 10 might have stipulated that the
proposition that compensation is “due” may be established only by an authority
identified in Article 6. But there is nothing of the kind."

In the present BIT, however, there is “something of the kind”, namely the provisions of

Article 4(4) and Article 4(5).

Lastly, it is noticeable that one of the Renta 4 arbitrators, Judge Brower, was also a
member of the tribunal in Austrian Airlines and concurred in the latter tribunal’s
decision that Article 8(1) of the present BIT does not confer jurisdiction over anything
other than the amount and arrangements for payment of compensation. The award in
Austrian Airlines was given some six months after that in Renta 4 award and expressly
distinguishes the BIT between Austria and the Slovak Republic from those at issue in
Renta 4, commenting that what might have been “a valid argument under the treaties
applicable in EMV v. Czech Republic and Renta 4 v. Russia ... cannot succeed here in
the light of the unmistakable meaning of Articles 8 and 4.°"* Judge Brower concurred
both in this part of the Austrian Airlines award and in the corresponding part of

Renta 4.

The reasoning in these four awards and in the judgment of the High Court in EMV thus
reinforces the conclusion which the present Tribunal had provisionally reached in
relation to the ordinary meaning of the words in Articles 4 and 8 of the present BIT.
The Tribunal did not find the other awards cited by the Parties of much assistance.
Berschader v. Russian Federation, on which the Respondent relied, comes to the same
conclusion as RosInvest, but the relevant part of the award is obiter and contains no
reasoning not set out in the other awards reviewed above. Saipem v. Bangladesh,
Telenor v. Hungary and Sedelmayer v. Russian Federation are invoked by the
Claimant, because they all take the view that the BIT in question conferred jurisdiction
to determine whether there had been an expropriation but in none of the cases was the
issue contested. In addition, the BIT in Saipem contained an arbitration clause in terms

significantly broader than that in the present case. Tza Yap Shum v. Peru contains more

of a discussion, but the relevant treaty provision was significantly different from that in

the present case.

Two other matters need to be considered before the Tribunal can reach a final
conclusion on this point. First, the Claimant argues that a broader construction is
justified by the object and purpose of the BIT. It maintains that the purpose of the BIT
is to ensure investor protection and that this goal justifies a more expansive
construction of Article 8 so as to render the right of recourse to arbitration, which it
sees as a key feature of that protection, more effective. In this argument, it derives
considerable support from the reasoning in Renta 4 and, to some extent, from that of the
High Court in EMV. The Tribunal agrees that the protection of foreign investment is
one (though not the only one) of the purposes of the BIT and is, therefore, an important
factor in interpretation of the provisions of the BIT. That does not, however, entitle the
Tribunal to disregard or ride roughshod over the provisions agreed between the States
Parties to the BIT. Reference to the object and purpose of a treaty does not entitle a
tribunal to rewrite the bargain between the parties to that treaty on the ground that they
could have made a better bargain which would more effectively have secured the object
and purpose of their treaty. In particular, the Tribunal cannot accept what appears to be
the premise of the Claimant’s argument, namely that treaty provisions laying down
standards of substantive treatment for an investor must be deemed ineffective if they
are not enforceable through arbitration. It may well be the case that such provisions are
more effective if they are enforceable in that way, but the States Parties to the present
BIT clearly decided that (subject to the later discussion of the MFN clause) they would
adopt several substantive standards, such as the requirement of fair and equitable
treatment in Article 2, which would not be enforceable through arbitration. There are
numerous other BITs in which the same choice has been made and one State which is
both a major recipient of foreign investment and the State of nationality of some
important investors, namely Australia, has recently announced that its policy will be not
to include any investor-State arbitration provisions in its future BITs. Like the tribunal
in the Austrian Airlines case, the Tribunal considers, therefore, that considerations of
the object and purpose of the BIT cannot prevail over the clear meaning of the words

used in Articles 4 and 8 of the BIT.

Secondly, the Claimant argued that there was in reality no possibility of it being able to
contest the issue whether it had been the victim of an expropriation or equivalent
measure in proceedings in the courts of the Slovak Republic, so that a broader
interpretation of Article 8 was required. The Tribunal does not agree. It is unable to
see how an argument about what remedies might be available in 2012 can be relevant to
the interpretation of an agreement concluded twenty years earlier. Moreover, the
Claimant’s argument sits uneasily alongside the fact that it has commenced proceedings

in the Slovak courts raising, inter alia, precisely this question.

The Tribunal’s analysis of the text of Article 8 in its context and in the light of the
object and purpose of the BIT having led to a clear conclusion, it is not necessary to
examine the travaux préparatoires of the BIT. However, since these will have to be
examined in connection with the MFN argument (considered below), the Tribunal
observes that, although the travaux préparatoires of Article 8 make clear that the
provision was intentionally narrowed from the much wider clause originally proposed
by Austria, they contain no clear indication of precisely how narrow the new clause was

intended to be and thus do not add anything to the preceding analysis.

The Tribunal thus concludes that, subject to what it will say in the following sections of
the award regarding the 2011 judgment of the Constitutional Court and the Claimant’s

MEN argument, the Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection is well-founded.

B. THE JUDGMENT OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL COURT
1. The Positions of the Parties

The Tribunal must next consider the Claimant’s argument regarding the effect of the
2011 judgment of the Constitutional Court on the scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
regarding the Article 4 claims. Each Party submitted expert evidence on the effects of
the judgment: the Respondent annexed to its Reply a witness statement from Professor
JUDr Jan Kluéka, CSc, while the Claimant submitted with its Rejoinder a witness
statement from Professor JUDr Alexander Bréstl, CSc. Both experts are former judges
of the Constitutional Court. Although this issue arises in relation to the Respondent’s

third jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal begins with the arguments put forward by the

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction
22 October 2012

Page 134 of 160

Claimant, since it was the Claimant which advanced the argument that the judgment

provides a response to that jurisdictional objection.

(1) The Claimant

390.

391.

392.

The judgment of the Constitutional Court of the Slovak Republic, adopted on 26
January 2011 and delivered on 24 March 2011,*°° concluded that Amendment I

contravened the Constitution of the Slovak Republic in the following ways:

(1) it amounted to a material restriction of property rights, contrary to Article 20 of
the Constitution and Article 1 of the First Protocol to the ECHR;

(2) it entailed an unjustified interference with the right of the private health insurers to
conduct their business, contrary to Article 35 of the Constitution;

(3) it involved a Constitutionally unacceptable interference with the general principle
of the rule of law.

The case had been brought before the Constitutional Court by a group of deputies of the

National Assembly of the Slovak Republic.

The Claimant maintains that the judgment amounts to a finding that its investment was
the subject of an unlawful expropriation and that “[t]he matter is now finally
determined by the Slovak Republic’s highest court on this issue and is res judicata.’
The Claimant acknowledges that it was not a party to the proceedings before the
Constitutional Court but maintains that the judgment has effect erga omnes, so that “it
does not matter whether the Constitutional Court’s decision specifically addresses an

individual investor.”"*

While the judgment does not speak of “expropriation” but rather of “substantial

restriction of property rights,”

the Claimant argues that the “facts subsumed by the
Constitutional Court under the Slovak constitutional law category of ‘substantial
restriction of property rights’ can be subsumed under the concept of ‘measures having

similar consequences’ in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.” In any event, the Claimant

submits that since the Tribunal has to decide the dispute under the Treaty, and thus

under international law, the precise categorization of the act under Slovak constitutional

law is irrelevant**' since what matters in international arbitration is the factual

determination of the measure under international law, not under the national law of

respondent State.*”

(2) The Respondent

393.

394.

395.

The Respondent replied that the doctrine of res judicata could not be applicable as the
Claimant had not been a party to the proceedings before the Constitutional Court.
According to the Respondent, the doctrine of res judicata applies only in the event that
the parties to the earlier proceedings are the same as those in the subsequent
proceedings. In any event, the Respondent, referring to the language used by the
Constitutional Court, maintained that the judgment did not amount to a finding of

expropriation or other similar measures but was based upon different considerations.

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that this is not a case of res judicata. As the
British-United States Claims Tribunal explained:
It is a well established rule of law that the doctrine of res judicata applies only
where there is identity of the parties and of the question at issue.**
These requirements were reiterated by the Permanent Court of International Justice in
its Opinion on the Polish Postal Service in Danzig, and feature in the literature on res

judicata.“

Neither the Claimant in the proceedings before this Tribunal, nor its
subsidiary EIC, was party to the proceedings before the Constitutional Court, so the

doctrine of res judicata has no application.

Nevertheless, that does not make the judgment of the Constitutional Court irrelevant.

Article 4(4) of the BIT gives the Claimant the right to have the legitimacy of an act of

expropriation or other similar measure determined by the competent authorities of the
Respondent. If, as the Claimant suggests, one effect of the judgment of the
Constitutional Court is that the legality of Amendment I cannot be raised in other
proceedings before the Slovak courts, because the matter was treated as having been
settled by that judgment, it would be unduly formalistic to hold that the judgment of the
Constitutional Court could not qualify as the Article 4(4) ruling for the purpose of
proceedings brought under Articles 8 and 4(5) of the BIT. The Tribunal considers,
therefore, that it must inquire into what was decided by the judgment of the

Constitutional Court.

396. In doing so, it is particularly important to be clear as to precisely what is the issue
before this Tribunal. That issue is whether or not the Constitutional Court found that
Amendment I amounted to an expropriation, or a measure of similar effect, within the
meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT. The Court was not, of course, applying the BIT. It
judged Amendment I against the yardstick of the Constitution and the provisions of
Article 1 of Protocol I to the European Convention on Human Rights. Nevertheless,
that does not render the judgment irrelevant for present purposes. If the Court
considered Amendment I to be an expropriation, or characterised it in such a way as to
make clear that the Court treated Amendment I as an act having effects similar to an
expropriation, that judgment would be of considerable importance for the present

proceedings.**

397. It follows that the only part of the judgment of the Constitutional Court which is
material is its finding that Amendment I constituted a “forced restriction of ownership
rights of health insurance agencies and their shareholders.”*° The Court’s other

findings — that the Amendment was a violation of the Constitutional right to conduct a

85 Tn its Rejoinder, the Claimant argued that Slovakia could not rely upon Slovak law, as applied by the Court,
to avoid its obligations under international law, see Claimant’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, #§]188 et seq. The
Tribunal does not see the relevance of this argument. There is a well established principle in international law
that a State may not rely upon its own domestic law to justify non-compliance with a treaty obligation but that is
not the issue here. There is no suggestion that the Respondent can rely upon the judgment of the Constitutional
Court, or upon that Court’s application of Slovak law, to avoid being found in breach of the BIT; the question is
whether the judgment of the Constitutional Court amounts to a finding that there had been an expropriation or
other similar act, thus enabling the Claimant to avoid the limits on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Article
8 of the BIT which the Tribunal has identified in Chapter V(A) of the award.

“3 Paragraph (a) of the Court’s conclusions (Part VI, p. 63 of the English translation supplied by the Claimant;
(CL-105)).

  

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Page 137 of 160

business and that it infringed the Constitutional protection of the rule of law — address
different matters and have no direct bearing on whether the Amendment was

considered to be an expropriation or similar measure.

398. In concluding that the Amendment was a restriction of ownership rights, the Court

applied Article 20 of the Constitution, the relevant parts of which read as follows:

(1) Everyone shall have the right to own property. Property rights of all owners
shall be uniformly construed and equally protected by law. The right of
inheritance is guaranteed.

(4) Expropriation or restrictions of right in property may be imposed only to the
necessary extent and in public interest, based on the law and for a valuable
consideration.

399. The Court also took account of Article 1 of Protocol I to the ECHR, which reads as

follows:

Protection of Property

Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his
possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public
interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general
principles of international law.

The preceding provisions shall not, however, in any way impair the right of a State
to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in
accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other
contributions or penalties.

400. It is apparent that both of these provisions, while they include the acts of expropriation,
also embrace other measures concerning property which fall short of anything that
could be regarded as expropriation. In the case of Article 20 of the Constitution, the
Respondent’s expert witness, Professor Kluéka, testified that the concept of forced
restriction of ownership rights included expropriation but also encompassed a range of
lesser measures. Professor Bréstl, the Claimant’s expert witness, considered that

forced restriction of ownership rights in Article 20(4) of the Constitution is close
to an equivalent to indirect expropriation (“measures having similar consequences”

as expropriation and nationalization) in the sense of Article 4(1) of the
Austria/Slovakia BIT.

Page 138 of 160

He did not, however, consider the two concepts to be identical.”

401. In the case of Article 1 of the Protocol, the ECtHR has held, in Sporrong and Lénnroth

v. Sweden that

That Article comprises three distinct rules. The first rule, which is of a general
nature, enounces the principle of peaceful enjoyment of property; it is set out in the
first sentence of the first paragraph. The second rule covers deprivation of
possessions and subjects it to certain conditions; it is set out in the second sentence
of the same paragraph. The third rule recognizes that the States are entitled,
amongst other things, to control the use of property in accordance with the general
interest, by enforcing such laws as they deem necessary for the purpose; it is
contained in the second paragraph."**

The ECtHR, however, recognizes a close relationship between these three rules.

402. The Tribunal considers that Article 20 of the Constitution and Article 1 of the Protocol

are broader in scope than Article 4 of the BIT and were treated as such by the
Constitutional Court in its judgment of 24 March 2011. That is scarcely surprising.
Both Article 20 of the Constitution and Article 1 of the Protocol contain a
comprehensive protection of property rights. Article 4 of the BIT, on the other hand, is
only one of a number of provisions protecting the property rights of an investor. In
particular, Article 2(1) of the BIT requires that the investment be accorded fair and
equitable treatment. Some aspects of the protection afforded by Article 1 of the
Protocol and Article 20 of the Constitution, as discussed in the judgment of March 2011
(and the Strasbourg case-law cited therein), appear to correspond to the protection
afforded by the right to fair and equitable treatment, rather than the protection from

expropriation and similar measures.

403. The Constitutional Court did not find that Amendment I amounted to expropriation

437
438

(and the plaintiffs in the proceedings before it seem not to have contended that it did).

At page 49 of its judgment, the Court stated that

When there is expropriation, there is transfer of ownership title to the property. When
there is restriction of ownership, no transfer occurs, there is only interference with the
scope of entitlements arising out of the ownership title warranted by the Constitution (II.
US 8/97). Section 20 subsection 4 of the Constitution suggests that interference with
ownership rights (either through expropriation or forced restriction thereof) may be

Page 139 of 160

acceptable from the point of view of the Constitution only if it is made in the public
interest and to the extent, which is strictly necessary, by virtue of the law and against fair
compensation.*”
Having thus distinguished between expropriation and restriction of ownership rights,
the Court then proceeded to a finding that Amendment I amounted to a restriction of

ownership rights.

404. Nevertheless, as the Claimant points out in its Rejoinder, Article 4(1) deals not only

with expropriation but also with measures having the same (or, in some translations,
similar) consequences. The Tribunal has therefore considered whether the restriction of
ownership rights which the Constitutional Court found had occurred amounted to a
measure having the same, or similar, consequences as expropriation, a concept which
can be described as “de facto expropriation”. That is not an easy task since the Court,
unsurprisingly given that it was not applying the BIT, did not express itself in the
language of Article 4(1). Nevertheless, the Tribunal has concluded that the Court did
not find that Amendment I amounted to a measure having the same (or similar)
consequences as expropriation. As the Court said, the essence of expropriation is a
taking of ownership rights. There is nothing in the Court’s judgment to suggest that it
considered that Amendment I produced consequences which were the same as, or

similar to, such a taking.

405. Examination of the Strasbourg judgments to which the Constitutional Court referred at

pages 44-47 of its judgment, confirms the conclusion that it did not regard Amendment
I as having attained that level. The Court noted that the ECtHR had interpreted the
second rule in Article 1 of Protocol I as including not just formal expropriation but also
de facto expropriation, which included deprivation of the right to dispose of property.
It then cited the judgments of the ECtHR in Mellacher v. Austria“ and Velosa Barreto
v. Portugal,’ both of which concerned the imposition of rent restrictions. In both
cases, the ECtHR held that the acts in question did not amount to expropriation, either
de jure or de facto, because the owner retained the right to dispose of the property but

went on to consider whether the restriction on the use of the property by the owner

Page 140 of 160

amounted to a violation of the more general rule contained in Article 1. It seems to the
Tribunal that the Constitutional Court was, therefore, clearly aware that there was a
category of impermissible restrictions on the use of property by its owner which did not
amount to de facto expropriation and that the dividing line between that category and
de facto expropriation lay in whether or not the owner was deprived of the right to
dispose of his property. The Court did not find that Amendment I went so far as to
deprive the private health insurers and their shareholders of the right to dispose of their
property (indeed, in the case of the Claimant, it was able to dispose of its shareholding
— at a price substantially higher than it had paid for the shares — not long after the
enactment of Amendment I). While the findings of the Constitutional Court, made as
they were without reference to the provisions of the BIT and in general terms — none of
the health insurers being party to the proceedings — are not easy to analyse in terms of
Article 4(1) of the BIT, it is for the Claimant, as the party relying on the judgment on
this point, to establish that the judgment of the Constitutional Court amounts to a
finding that the Slovak Republic had adopted a measure of the kind covered by Article
4(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not succeeded in

establishing that proposition.

Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s argument based upon the
Constitutional Court’s judgment of 24 March 2011, to the effect that it would amount to
a finding that Amendment I was an expropriation, or a measure equivalent to an

expropriation, of the Claimant’s rights within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the BIT.

Cc. THE EFFECT OF THE MEN CLAUSE

The Tribunal thus turns to the argument advanced by the Claimant regarding the effect
of the MEN clause in the BIT. That clause is contained in Article 3, which provides as

follows:

(1) Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party
and to their investments treatment that is no less favourable than that which it
accords to its own investors or to investors of any third States and their
investments.

(2) The provisions of para. 1, however, shall not apply to present or future
privileges granted by one Contracting Party to investors of a third State or their
investments in connection with

PCA Case No. 2010-17
Award on Jurisdiction
22 October 2012

Page 141 of 160

(a) an economic union, customs union, a common market, free trade zone or
economic community;

(b) an international agreement or a bilateral agreement or national laws and
regulations concerning matters of taxation;

(c) a regulation to facilitate border traffic.

The translation is that supplied by the Claimant after the close of the hearings but, in
contrast to the position regarding certain other provisions, it is not contested by the

Respondent.” Again, it is appropriate to begin with the Claimant’s arguments.
1. The Positions of the Parties

(1) The Claimant

408. The Claimant argues that the effect of Article 3 is that, notwithstanding the limitations

in the text of Article 8, the Tribunal has jurisdiction over its expropriation and Article 2

' The Claimant submits that MFN clauses are “a source of international

claims.*
obligations other than those explicitly included in the basic treaty” that allows for
“borrowing treaty provisions from other treaties or possibly state practice regarding
third states.”““* The Claimant argues that the Treaty’s MFN clause in Article 3(1) is a

“neutral clause which is worded openly, without explicitly excluding or including

matters of dispute resolution or the host state’s consent to arbitration.”

409. The Claimant challenges the Austrian Airlines majority’s conclusion that the Treaty’s
MEN clause had to be read in the context of Article 8. Rather, the Claimant cites the
dissenting opinion of Judge Brower who held that “if every time an MFN clause were
invoked it were read together with the provision which the MFN clause is alleged to

circumvent, such a clause might never be given any effect; it would be vitiated by that

27446

which it seeks to avoid, modify or expand. The Claimant also argues that the

Austrian Airlines tribunal erred in considering the travaux préparatoires of the Treaty

*® Respondent's letter to the Tribunal of 27 January 2012, p. 4 contains the statement that “to assist the Tribunal
in narrowing the areas of disagreement between the Parties, Respondent notes that, in the case of the Preamble
and Articles 3, 6, 7 and 9, there are no material differences between Respondent’s Exhibit RL-40B and
Claimant’s newly proposed translation.”

to limit the scope of the MFN clause, pursuant to Article 32 VCLT, because the MFN

clause is not ambiguous.“”’

The Claimant traces the changes in the MFN clause during the negotiating history of
the Treaty, and argues that the “travaux préparatoires show no intention of the parties
to limit the scope and operation of the MFN clause by the working of the arbitration
clause.” The Claimant concludes that “[i]f Article 8 was specifically negotiated (and
narrowed down), Article 3 was equally specifically negotiated (and not narrowed
down)”, noting in particular the fact that the exclusions listed in Article 3(2) do not

include dispute resolution.“

The Claimant discusses two cases, RosInvest and Renta 4, where “the availability of
broader dispute settlement clauses in other BITs of a host state via MFN clauses were
confirmed.” The Claimant relies on the Renta 4 case for arguing that the MFN clause
should apply to dispute resolution clauses, regardless of whether the right to bring
arbitration is characterised as a procedural or substantive right. Indeed, in Renta 4, the
tribunal rejected formal distinctions between procedural and substantive matters. The
Claimant further refers to a number of commentators who agree that a broadly worded
MEN clause that refers to “treatment” without qualification should be interpreted as

° The Claimant also

applying to dispute settlement as well as substantive matters.**
argues, based on the finding of the Ros/nvest tribunal, that “had the States Parties
intended that the MFN clause should not apply to arbitration, it would have been easy

to add corresponding language” noting that this was done in other CSFR BITs.**!

Furthermore, if an investor is unable to enforce its substantive rights under a BIT by
means of arbitration, while other investors are able to enforce their treaty rights in such
a fashion, the Claimant argues that the investor is clearly discriminated against with
regard to the substantive rights themselves, in violation of the object and purpose of the

treaty in general and the MFN clause in particular.

The Claimant submits that the term “treatment” in Article 3 is broad enough to apply to
dispute resolution. In this regard, the Claimant first refers to a number of cases,
including Gas Natural v. Argentina and Maffezini, where tribunals interpreted MFN
clauses referring to “all matters”, and concluded that “unless it appears clearly that the
States Parties to a BIT ... settled on a different method for resolution of disputes that
may arise, most-favoured-nation provisions in BITs should be understood to be

interpret the term “treatment” narrowly and that it is only a small step to interpret a
broad term like “treatment” to cover dispute settlement as well, even where the MFN
clause lacks the language of “all matters”.“* Furthermore, the Claimant submits that
the term “treatment” in Article 3 is only limited by the three circumstances enumerated

in Article 3(2).

The Claimant takes issue with the Respondent’s characterisation of the Claimant’s
argument as using the MFN clause as a tool of incorporation. Rather, the Claimant
argues that the MFN clause can be used to “borrow more favourable clauses in other

treaties.”***

The Claimant distinguishes the cases cited by the Respondent which rejected using the
MEN clause to broaden the dispute resolution clause available, submitting several
differences in those cases from the Treaty in the case at hand. First, the Claimant
argues that the RosInvest tribunal rejected expanding the dispute resolution clause via
Article 3(1) of the UK-Soviet BIT because it afforded protection to “investment” and
not “investors”. The Claimant submits that the Renta 4 tribunal denied the use of the
MEN clause because of the wording of another article in the Spain-Russia BIT which
limited the MFN clause to the realm of the fair and equitable treatment, which the
Claimant contrasts with the language of the MFN in the Treaty.“ The Claimant
disputes the relevance of the Plama decision for the case at hand, arguing that the

relevant BIT in that case did not provide for investor-state arbitration and the investor

was therefore trying to replace a jurisdictional provision which did not allow investor-

state arbitration.

The Claimant maintains that, in application of the MFN clause, it may avail itself of
treaties adopted before the present BIT.’ Furthermore, the Claimant argues, based on
an ordinary meaning interpretation, that Article 3 of the Treaty contains no temporal
limitations, since the treatment is “accorded”, which includes both past and future
tenses.**’ In the alternative, the Claimant also relies on the Croatia-Slovakia BIT and
the Hungary-Slovakia BIT which came into force in 1997 and 1996, respectively, and

which make broad provision for the arbitration of disputes.

Finally, the Claimant argues that “[t]he comparator for the purpose of the MFN clause
is not a ‘particular investor’ that has in fact been accorded more favourable treatment in
the form of access to dispute resolution regarding ‘the measures challenged here’” as
alleged by the Respondent.*** In any event, the Claimant asserts that there are other
investors who have challenged the Amendment and who have benefited from wider
dispute resolution clauses, pointing to Eureko and HICEE who commenced arbitration

under the Netherlands-CSFR BIT.*”

The Claimant contends that neither the ability to bring claims before the Slovak courts,
nor the fact that it has done so in this case, proves in any way that this is an “effective
recourse.” The Claimant stresses that it does not argue that national courts are

“inferior” to international arbitration.“

Even if the courts did have jurisdiction
however, the Claimant argues that Austrian investors would face “an extremely
uncertain legal environment.” In the Claimant’s view, this would come at a high cost
which investors under more favourable BITs do not have to bear and thus forms an

instance of “concrete discrimination” covered by the MFN provision.“

(2) The Respondent

419. The Respondent objects to the Claimant’s invocation of the Article 3 MFN clause as a
basis for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The Respondent maintains that such an argument

has already been conclusively rejected under the present Treaty in Austrian Airlines.

420. The Respondent argues that a “clean reading of the investor-State jurisdictional clause
of Article 8”, namely its circumscribed jurisdictional mandate, shows that the Tribunal
“has no power to exercise any authority with respect to Article 3.“ The Respondent
also submits that, applying basic principles of Treaty interpretation, the Treaty’s MFN
clause provides no basis for incorporation of provisions from another Treaty to ground

jurisdiction.

421. The Respondent argues that the MFN clause of Article 3 must be read in the context of
the other provisions of the Treaty, including Article 8. The Respondent submits that
Article 8 of the Treaty provides a narrow basis of jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes.
According to the Respondent, the question is not whether the “MEN clause applies to
the Treaty’s Article 8 dispute resolution provision, but whether in view of the narrowly-
construed dispute resolution mechanism, the Tribunal may exercise any authority with
respect to the MFN provision of Article 3”. The Respondent then answers in the

463

negative, citing the cases of Nagel v. Czech Republic, EMV, and Telenor.

422. The Respondent counters the Claimant’s reliance on RosInvest, submitting that the
tribunal in that case “did not enter into the much more general question [of] whether
MEN-clauses can be used to transfer arbitration clauses from one treaty to another” and
that the MFN clause at issue had different wording (specifically the terms “use” and
“enjoyment”), and broader scope.“ The Respondent equally objects to the Claimant’s
reliance on the Renta 4 decision, alleging that the award did not extend the MFN clause
to “enlarge the competence of the tribunal” and that its “BIT by BIT analysis” applied

to this case demonstrates that “treatment” does not extend to dispute settlement.“

The Respondent also distinguishes the Maffezini decision, submitting that it was based

on a broad jurisdictional clause.‘

The Respondent further cites the Plama award for
the proposition that “an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not incorporate by
reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in another treaty,
unless the MEN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the Contracting
Parties intended to incorporate them” which it contends is not the case at hand.“
Lastly, the Respondent submits that, where tribunals have applied MFN clauses to
dispute settlement matters, they have done so only in respect of waiting periods and
other procedural hurdles and not in order to broaden the scope of jurisdiction under the

relevant treaty.**

The Respondent counters the Claimant’s argument that Article 3 is a tool of
incorporation, which it argues is “unsupported by the text of the Treaty, as well as

fundamental logic and rules of international law.”

The Respondent submits that
Article 3 sets out a treatment obligation, and does not allow for “borrowing” treaty
provisions from other treaties.‘ In addition, the Respondent argues that customary
international law requires that consent to jurisdiction be established by a preponderance
of evidence, which standard cannot be met here given the clear intention to limit

jurisdiction in Article 8.*”'

The Respondent argues that the “treatment” referred to in Article 3 does not include
dispute resolution and contests the Claimant’s characterisation of Article 3 as a broad
MEN clause.*” Rather, the Respondent submits that Article 3 is narrowly phrased in
contrast to broad MFN clauses that read “[iJn all matters subject to this Agreement”, the
latter drafting being the basis underlying the decisions that have extended MFN

treatment to dispute settlement matters under other treaties.‘

426. The Respondent also argues that the Treaty text itself confirms that “treatment” in
Article 3(1) pertains only to substantive matters, since where reference is made to the
adjudicatory process the Treaty employs the term “right”, while the term “privileges”

and “treatment” are used in Article 3.4%

427. The Respondent relies on the commentary to the ILC Report on MEN provisions and
the ejusdem generis rule of interpretation, arguing that unless there is substantial
identity between the subject-matter of the MFN clause and dispute resolution clause, an
MEN provision may result in imposing obligations on the State which were never

contemplated and this violates general principles of treaty interpretation.‘

428. The Respondent also takes issue with the Claimant’s argument that the Austrian
Airlines tribunal did not properly consider the interpretive principle of expressio unius
est exclusio alterius. The tribunal gave ample consideration to the principle and, in any
event, the rule when applied to Article 8, clearly contradicts the Claimant’s MFN-based

claim to jurisdiction.“

429. Finally, the Respondent contends that, even if the MFN clause is used to incorporate
provisions from other treaties, it would not eliminate Article 4(4) and (5), resulting in a

pathological arbitration clause.”

430. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s assertion that the Austrian Airlines tribunal
improperly considered the Treaty’s negotiating history. The Respondent argues that
Article 32 of the VCLT provides for recourse to the travaux préparatoires for treaty
interpretation without any need for a formal finding that the treaty terms at issue are
ambiguous, and in particular the travaux can be referred to in order to confirm an
interpretation of the treaty. The Respondent submits that the negotiating history of

Article 8 of the Treaty is dynamic and indicates a “deliberate choice to limit the

jurisdiction”. By contrast, the Respondent alleges that the history of the MFN clause is

“static”, which is why it was not considered by the Austrian Airlines tribunal.

The Respondent argues that the “treaty practices of both Slovakia and Austria also
confirm the conclusions that the State-Parties did not have dispute resolution in mind
when they agreed upon the Article 3(1) MFN obligation”, a conclusion it alleges is

supported by the Austrian Airlines tribunal.*”

The Respondent submits that the MFN clause only operates with regard to later treaties,
and it contends that all four specific treaties invoked by the Claimant to supplant the
instant Treaty’s Article 8 entered into force before the BIT, such that they cannot be

relied upon to expand the Tribunal’s jurisdictional mandate.**°

Finally, the Respondent contends that, even accepting arguendo that the different
dispute resolution mechanisms constitute “treatment” under Article 3 of the Treaty, the
Claimant has still failed to prove such treatment, as it has not shown that other investors
have been accorded more favourable treatment.**' In addition, the Respondent asserts
that the Claimant still has an effective recourse available before the Slovak courts and
that the Claimant has offered “no basis to judge the insufficiency of the Slovak

courts.”

2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal will begin its analysis by disposing of certain arguments which it does not

consider to be well-founded.

First, the Tribunal is not persuaded by the Respondent’s argument that the Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction to rule upon the Claimant’s Article 3 argument, because Article 3 is
not one of the provisions specified in Article 8 of the BIT. That argument confuses, or
conflates, two entirely different issues. If the Claimant were seeking to advance before
the Tribunal a claim that the Respondent had committed a violation of Article 3 of the

BIT, as part of the substantive standards of protection prescribed by the BIT, by

 

436.

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Award on Jurisdiction

22 October 2012

Page 149 of 160

denying the Claimant recourse to arbitration, then the objection that such a claim is not
within the scope of the jurisdiction conferred by Article 8 would be a potent one.
However, that is not what the Claimant is seeking to do. The Claimant relies on Article
3 of the BIT, not as the substantive basis for a claim, but rather as indicating that each
State Party to the BIT intended to make an offer to arbitrate that was wider than the
terms of Article 8“ to the extent that such State Party concluded a treaty with a third
State containing an arbitration clause which was wider and more favourable to an
investor. The Tribunal agrees with the Austrian Airlines tribunal that it has jurisdiction
to rule on this argument in the exercise of its compétence de la compétence.™ The
Tribunal considers that the same confusion is evident in the Respondent’s argument
that the Claimant must adduce evidence of a specific investor of a third State who has
received treatment more favourable than that accorded to the Claimant. The award in
the NAFTA case of Loewen v. United States,** on which the Respondent bases this
argument, is not about the application of an MFN clause but concerns a claim for
alleged discrimination. In order to recover damages for discriminatory treatment, a
claimant must normally establish the existence of a comparator and then demonstrate
that such comparator has received better treatment than that which the claimant has
received. But, as explained in the previous paragraph, the Claimant in the present case
is not making a claim for relief for an alleged breach of the MFN clause but is arguing
that the effect of that clause is that it is entitled to the benefit of higher standards of
protection provided for in other treaties. Accordingly, it is not a matter of comparison
with the actual treatment accorded to a specific third State investor, but of comparison
between the standard of treatment guaranteed to a group of investors by one treaty and

the standard of treatment guaranteed to another group of investors by another treaty.

Secondly, the Tribunal considers that it can derive only limited assistance from the
numerous awards of other tribunals to which the Parties referred. While the Tribunal
has paid careful attention to the awards in other cases, it is plain that they reveal no
clear arbitral consensus on this issue. Indeed, so far from constituting a jurisprudence

constante, they manifest a complete lack of consistency, which is the product of a

fundamental difference of views between various arbitrators.“’ Thus, arguments to the

effect that an arbitration clause may be affected by the MFN provision have been
accepted in Maffezini v. Spain, Camuzzi v. Argentina, Gas Natural v. Argentina, Suez
Sociedad General de Aguas and Interaguas v. Argentina, National Grid v. Argentina,
Siemens v. Argentina, RosInvest v. Russian Federation, AWG Group v. Argentina,
Impregilo v. Argentina (with a dissenting opinion by Professor Stern) and Hochtief v.
Argentina (with a dissenting opinion by Mr Thomas).“*’ Such arguments have,
however, been rejected by the tribunals in Técnicas Medioambientales v. Mexico, Salini
v. Jordan, Plama v. Bulgaria, Berschader v. Russian Federation (with a dissenting
opinion by Mr Weiler), Telenor v. Hungary, Wintershall v. Argentina, Renta 4 v.
Russian Federation (with a separate opinion by Judge Brower), Tza Yap Shum v. Peru,
Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic (with a dissenting opinion by Judge Brower), JCS
vy. Argentina, and, most recently, Daimler v. Argentina (with a dissenting opinion by

Judge Brower).**

437. This lack of a jurisprudence constante cannot be explained only by reference to
differences between the terms of the BITs involved (although such differences can be
significant). Of the four tribunals to have ruled on the effect of the MFN clause in the
Argentina-Germany BIT on the requirement in the arbitration clause of that BIT that
disputes could be submitted to arbitration only after a period of eighteen months had

elapsed from their submission to the local courts, those in Wintershall and Daimler

rejected the MFN argument, while those in Siemens and Hochtief accepted it.
Moreover, even where tribunals have come to the same conclusion, they have often
done so for radically different reasons, as a comparison between the awards in Plama
and Renta 4 demonstrates. Accordingly, while the Tribunal has drawn on the reasoning
in the various awards where appropriate, it has not felt compelled to follow any

particular line of awards.

In this context, the Tribunal notes the Respondent’s contention that there is no basis for
the Tribunal to “depart from” the award of the majority in Austrian Airlines. In the
view of the Tribunal, that way of putting the point goes too far. There is no doctrine of
binding precedent in international law and the present Tribunal is not bound by the
award in Austrian Airlines (or any other case). Nor is there a presumption in favour of
following the award in Austrian Airlines in the sense that, unless the Claimant can offer
a compelling reason to do so, the Tribunal is in some way obliged to decide the MFN
point in the present case in the same way in which the Austrian Airlines tribunal
decided that point in the case before it. Of course, the Tribunal has paid close attention
to the award in Austrian Airlines, as will be apparent from the following paragraphs; it
is a well reasoned award addressing precisely the point in issue here under the same
BIT. It was, however, subject to a dissenting opinion on this point and the Tribunal
does not consider that it can simply adopt the reasoning of the majority in Austrian

Airlines without discussion.

Finally, both Parties suggested that the Tribunal should approach the MFN issue from
the standpoint of what they identified as a “principle” or “presumption” regarding a
State’s submission to arbitration. The Claimant urged that a broad, “liberal” approach
was warranted by what it identified as the object and purpose of the BIT. By contrast,
the Respondent argued that treaty provisions by which a State agrees to the jurisdiction
of an international court or tribunal should be restrictively construed. The Tribunal
does not agree with either of these submissions. The Tribunal has already stated (in
paragraph 326, above) that it does not consider that the object and purpose of the BIT
require either a broad or a restrictive approach to the interpretation of its provision for

arbitration. Nor does the Tribunal accept that there is any general principle of

440.

441.

442.

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Award on Jurisdiction

22 October 2012

Page 152 of 160

international law that the acceptance by a State of the jurisdiction of an international

court or tribunal must be restrictively construed.

The Tribunal thus considers that its approach to the question before it is not determined
by the awards of tribunals in earlier cases or by any general principle or presumption

regarding jurisdiction.

The question before the Tribunal is whether or not the claims for alleged violations of
Articles 2 and 4 of the BIT fall within the scope of the agreement to arbitrate. Where
an investor initiates arbitration proceedings in reliance on the terms of a BIT, the
agreement to arbitrate takes a peculiar form, arising from the fact that the claimant in
the arbitration proceedings is relying on the provision for arbitration contained in an
instrument — the BIT — to which it is not a party.” The provision for arbitration in the
BIT thus operates at two levels: as between the States Parties to the BIT, it is one of
several reciprocal undertakings which take effect on the level of treaty commitments
between two States, but it also operates as an offer extended by each State Party to
investors of the other State Party to submit to arbitration the disputes specified in that
provision. By initiating arbitration proceedings, an investor accepts that offer and thus
brings into being the agreement to arbitrate from which the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
is derived. Since it is the terms of the offer which determine the content of the
agreement to arbitrate, the limits of that agreement and, therefore, of the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal, are dictated by the intentions of the States Parties to the BIT as expressed
in the provisions of the BIT, provisions which have to be interpreted in accordance with

the international law rules on treaty interpretation set out in paragraphs 315-316, above.

In concluding that BIT, those two States were free to frame their offer of arbitration in
whatever way they saw fit. It might be broad (e.g. applying to any dispute regarding a
qualifying investment) or narrow (e.g. confining arbitration to disputes relating only to
certain aspects of the treatment of investments required by the other provisions of the
BIT). The more than 2000 BITs currently in force include a wide range of arbitration
clauses of both kinds, as well as examples which fall between the two extremes and

cases in which the BIT contains no provision for arbitration at all.

Page 153 of 160

The States Parties to a BIT are also free to choose the manner in which they express
their consent to arbitration. They may do so in one clause or in more than one. There
is no inherent reason why the limits of the consent to arbitrate cannot be ascertained by
examination of more than one clause. Nor is there any general principle which
precludes an MFN clause from being one of those provisions which determine the
extent of the consent to arbitration; if a BIT contained an MFN clause which expressly
stated that it was applicable to the disputes settlement provision of that BIT (as is the
case with some recent United Kingdom BITs),"” then a tribunal seeking to determine
the extent of the consent to arbitrate under such a BIT would have to apply that MFN
clause, as well as the arbitration clause in the treaty, in order to determine the scope of

the State’s consent to arbitration.

The text of Article 3(1) is neutral in its wording. There is no express provision that the
guarantee of most favoured nation treatment is intended to apply to investor-State
arbitration but nor is there an express provision excluding that possibility. What the
Tribunal is therefore called upon to decide is whether the States Parties to the present
BIT intended that Article 3 should widen the offer of arbitration set out in Article 8 so
as to include (a) issues regarding expropriation which Articles 4 and 8 taken together
assign to the national courts and (b) issues regarding alleged violations of Article 2 of

the BIT which are wholly outside the terms of Article 8.

The Tribunal considers that there is a fundamental difference between Article 8 of the
BIT and the other provisions, including Article 3. The difference lies in the fact that
the investor-State arbitration clause in a BIT is the only one which creates — or rather
makes possible the creation of — a direct relationship between one of the States Parties
to the BIT and an investor. The inter-State arbitration provision in a BIT operates at the
“normal” level of relations between the two States Parties to the treaty. The provisions
on substantive standards of treatment (such as a provision requiring fair and equitable
treatment) confer rights upon investors, but do so entirely through the medium of
agreement between the States Parties. By contrast, a clause which provides for the
investor of one State Party to arbitrate with the other States Party, although it derives its

legal force from the agreement between the two States Parties, operates (as explained in

4° See United Kingdom Model BIT 2005 (with 2006 amendments), Article 3(3).

446.

447.

448.

paragraph 441, above) not only as an undertaking between the States Parties but also as
an offer by each State Party to qualifying investors of the other State Party. If such an
investor opts to accept that offer by commencing arbitration proceedings, the result is
the creation of an entirely new, direct, relationship between that investor and the State
Party concerned. The resulting dual character of the investor-State arbitration provision
was the (very substantial) innovation introduced into international law by the network
of BITs and similar treaties and one which many States had difficulty accepting (as the
records of negotiations concerning the present BIT and numerous other BITs

demonstrate).

The provision for arbitration in a BIT is thus the gateway through which the investor
must pass in order to create an arbitration agreement and confer jurisdiction upon a
tribunal to hear its claims regarding breach of the standards of treatment to which it is
entitled under the BIT. Applying an MFN clause so as to alter the scope of that
arbitration provision is therefore a very different matter from applying an MFN clause
to the other provisions of the BIT’s legal régime which do not have the same dual

character.

The full extent of that difference may be demonstrated by one example. Ifa BIT has no
provision for investor-State arbitration, there is no offer of arbitration and thus no scope
for the creation of an arbitration agreement. Even if that BIT contains a broadly
worded MFN clause, that clause cannot substitute for the arbitration provision and
make it possible for an investor successfully to bring arbitration proceedings against a
State Party to the BIT, no matter what provisions for arbitration that State Party might
have agreed to include in its other BITs. By contrast, if a BIT contains no provision on
fair and equitable treatment, an investor may nonetheless be able to derive from the
MEN clause contained in that BIT a right to be accorded such treatment by one of the
States Parties, provided that there is at least one other BIT concluded by that State

which contains a provision for fair and equitable treatment.

While the present BIT does, of course, contain a provision for investor-State arbitration,
the substantive scope of that provision is strictly limited. It encompasses disputes
regarding Article 5 of the BIT and certain aspects of Article 4 but, as the Tribunal has
found in Chapter V(A) of the Award, it excludes disputes regarding other aspects of

PCA Case No. 2010-17

Award on Jurisdiction

22 October 2012

Page 155 of 160

Article 4 and alleged violations of the other provisions of the BIT. As regards those
categories of disputes, there is no offer of arbitration at all. Acceptance of the

Claimant’s argument would therefore mean that the MFN clause completely

transformed the scope of the arbitration provision.

449. That would be to accord the MFN clause a far more dramatic result than that achieved

in all but one of the awards (listed in paragraph 436, above) in which a tribunal has
upheld an argument that the MFN clause in a BIT affected that treaty’s arbitration

provision."

With that one exception, all of those cases concerned, not limits on the
substantive scope of the provision for arbitration, but requirements to submit a dispute
to national courts for a period of time before that dispute could be brought to an
investor-State arbitration tribunal. In those cases, the dispute was one which fell within
the substantive scope of the offer to arbitrate. Even so, the issue was a highly
controversial one, as demonstrated by the fact that the MFN argument was accepted by
some arbitration tribunals and rejected by others. The Tribunal in the present case does
not need to enter into that controversy and has no intention of doing so. It expresses no
opinion on whether those tribunals which accepted the MFN argument in the time-limit
cases were right to do so. For present purposes, the point is not whether those awards
are correct but simply that, even if they are so regarded, they were not concerned with
the kind of transformation in the scope of the offer to arbitrate which is at issue in the

present proceedings.”

450. The Tribunal therefore considers that the special character of the provision for investor-

45

491
492

State arbitration and the radical nature of the transformation in that provision which
acceptance of the Claimant’s argument would entail, both militate against attributing to
Article 3 of the BIT the effect suggested by the Claimant unless there are clear

indications that such was the intention of the States Parties.

1. The Tribunal does not find such clear indications in either the language of Article 3 or
its place in the context of the BIT, taken as a whole, to warrant the conclusion that the
States Parties intended that it should have the potential to transform the scope of the

offer to arbitrate in the way suggested by the Claimant. Article 3(1) requires the

Respondent to accord to Austrian investors and their investments “treatment” no less
favourable than that which it accords to its own investors or investors of third States.
The Tribunal is well aware that different tribunals have reached different conclusions
regarding the meaning of the term “treatment” and, in particular, whether that term
should be read as confined to “substantive” standards of treatment (such as those
addressed in Articles 2 and 4 of the present BIT) or as including also access to investor-
State arbitration. While the Tribunal agrees that either interpretation is plausible, it
considers that the term “treatment” is more apposite to cover substantive standards of
treatment than to apply to the provision for investor-State arbitration, given what has

already been said above regarding the special character of that provision.

That conclusion is reinforced by consideration of the place which Article 3 occupies in
the context of the BIT. Article 3(1) appears as part of a group of provisions which
prescribe the substantive standards to be accorded by one State Party to investments
and investors of the other State Party. Thus Article 2(1) requires that such investments
shall be accorded fair and equitable treatment; Article 4 accords certain rights in respect
of expropriation and similar measures; Article 5 guarantees rights of transfer. Article
3(1), as has been seen, requires that each State Party accord the other’s investors
“treatment” no less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or investors of
third States. Failure to comply with Article 3(1) would constitute a substantive breach
of the BIT in just the same way as would failure to comply with Article 2(1), Article 4
or Article 5. Bearing in mind what has been said above about the differences between
the substantive provisions of a BIT and the provision for investor-State arbitration, the
fact that Article 3(1) is located in the group of substantive provisions and worded in the
same way as the other substantive provisions suggests that it was not intended to be

capable of transforming the scope and extent of the investor-State arbitration provision.

The Tribunal considers that Article 3(2) is of no assistance in this matter. That
provision excludes from the scope of Article 3(1) privileges granted to investors of a
third State in connection with an economic union or similar agreement, taxation
instruments and regulations on border traffic. The Claimant argues that, on the
principle of expressio unius exclusio alterius, this list must be treated as an exhaustive

list of the matters excluded from the scope of Article 3(1). Article 3(2) is not, however,

dealing with the matters covered by Article 3(1) but rather with the sources to which
Article 3(1) refers. Article 3(2) makes clear that, e.g., an investor cannot use Article
3(1) to gain the benefit of a right to better treatment which has its source in an
economic union or double taxation agreement. It says nothing about what type of right

Article 3(1) was intended to apply to in the first place.

The Tribunal considers that the travaux préparatoires of Articles 3(1) and 8 confirm
that the States Parties did not intend the former provision to have the potential for
transforming the scope of the latter. The travaux of Article 8 show that there was a
deliberate decision to narrow the scope of investor-State arbitration. The initial
proposal from Austria was a clause which would have given jurisdiction in respect of
any dispute regarding investments covered by the BIT. That was replaced, at the
insistence of the CSFR, with a text substantially identical to the one finally agreed. By
contrast, the travaux give no indication that Article 3 was intended to have an effect
upon the carefully negotiated scope of Article 8. The Tribunal agrees with the
reasoning of the majority in the Austrian Airlines case that the travaux tend to confirm
the interpretation of Article 3(1) advanced by the Respondent. What is even more
important — given that the Claimant has to establish that the Parties intended to adopt a
MEN provision capable of expanding the scope of their agreement on investor-State
arbitration — is that the travaux lend no support to the interpretation advanced by the

Claimant.

The Tribunal, therefore, concludes that the MFN provision in Article 3(1) of the BIT
does not affect the scope of its jurisdiction under Article 8 and rejects the Claimant’s

argument to the contrary.

Accordingly, the Tribunal upholds the Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection.

VI. FOURTH OBJECTION: COMPLIANCE WITH NOTICE AND AMICABLE
SETTLEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ARTICLE 2 CLAIMS

457. The Respondent’s final jurisdictional objection is that the Claimant failed, with respect

to its Article 2 claims, to fulfil three pre-conditions for arbitration, namely (i) to give
notice of the specific claim; (ii) to allow six months for amicable settlement from the
date of that notice; and (iii) to make genuine efforts to engage in good faith negotiations
for such a settlement. According to the Respondent, compliance with these conditions
is a prerequisite to establishing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in respect of a claim. It
therefore maintains that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s Article 2

claims.“

458. The Tribunal’s decision in relation to the Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection

493

means, however, that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Article 2 claims in any
event, since Article 8 of the BIT confers jurisdiction only with regard to claims under
Article 5 and claims concerning the amount, or arrangements for payment, of
compensation under Article 4. That decision means that the conditions regarding
notice, negotiations and amicable settlement in Article 8 are not applicable to the
claims under Article 2. The Tribunal considers, therefore, that it is not called upon to
decide whether or not compliance with those conditions would have been a prerequisite

for jurisdiction, since such jurisdiction cannot exist in any event.

VII. COSTS

459. The effect of the Tribunal’s decisions on the different jurisdictional objections is that
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over all of the Claimant’s claims, except for those under
Article 5 of the BIT. As a result, the present award does not amount to a final disposal
of the case. The Tribunal therefore reserves the question of costs to the next phase of

the proceedings.

VIII. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION
460. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal:
(1) Rejects the Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection;
(2) Rejects the Respondent’s second jurisdictional objection;
(3) Upholds the Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection;

(4) Considers it is not required to rule upon the Respondent’s fourth jurisdictional

objection;

(5) Holds that it lacks jurisdiction over all aspects of the Claimant’s claim other
than the claim under Article 5 of the BIT; and

(6) Reserves to itself all matters regarding further proceedings in the case.

Done this 22" day of October 2012.

AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC AND THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA
CONCERNING THE PROMOTION AND PROTECTION OF
INVESTMENTS

THE CZECH AND SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC AND THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA, hereinafter
referred to as "the Contracting Parties",

DESIRING to develop friendly relations in conformity with the principles of the Final Act of
the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, signed on August 1, 1975 in Helsinki, and
desiring to create favorable conditions for greater economic cooperation between the Contracting
Parties,

RECOGNIZING that the promotion and protection of investments may strengthen the
readiness to make such investments and thereby make an important contribution to the
development of economic relations,

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

Article 1
Definitions

For the purpose of this Agreement:

1. The term "investment" shall mean all assets which an investor of one Contracting Party
invests in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its legislation, in
particular:

a) movable and immovable property, as well as any real rights;

b) shares and other forms of participation in enterprises;

c) claims and titles to money transferred to create an economic value, and claims to
performance having an economic value;

d) rights relating to intellectual property, including copyrights, industrial property rights such as
patents and inventions, trademarks, industrial designs, models and samples, technical
processes, know-how, business names and goodwill;

e) concessions under public law for prospecting, mining or extracting of natural resources;

(2) "Investor" shall mean, in the case of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic:

a) any natural person being a citizen of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic under
Czechoslovak law, being authorized to make investments under Czechoslovak law, and
making an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party;

b) any legal entity established in accordance with the Czechoslovak laws, having its seat in the
territory of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, and making an investment in the territory
of the other Contracting Party;

and in the case of the Republic of Austria:

a) any natural person having the citizenship of the Republic of Austria and making an
investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party;
b) any legal entity or partnership under commercial law established in accordance with the

laws of the Republic of Austria, having its seat in the territory of the Republic of Austria, and
making an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party;

"Earnings" shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment and includes, in particular, profits,
interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and license fees.

Article 2
Promotion and protection of investments

Each Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, promote investments made in its territory by
investors from the other Contracting Party, shall permit such investments in accordance with its
laws and shall accord them fair and equitable treatment.

Investments and the earnings yielded by investments shall have the full protection of this
Agreement. The same shall also apply to earnings from reinvestment. Legal extension or
alteration of the investment shall be in accordance with the laws and regulations of the
Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made.

Article 3
Treatment of Investments

Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to their
investments treatment that is no less favorable than that which it accords to its own investors
or to investors of any third states and their investments.

The provisions of para. 1 above, however, shall not apply to present or future privileges granted
by one Contracting Party to investors of a third state or their investments in connection with

a) an economic union, customs union, a common market, free trade zone or economic
community;
b) an international agreement or a bilateral arrangement or national laws and regulations

concerning matters of taxation;
c) aregulation to facilitate border traffic.

Article 4
Compensation

Expropriation measures, including nationalization or other measures having the same
consequences, may be applied in the territory of the other Contracting Party to investments of
investors of a Contracting Party only in cases where these expropriation measures are carried
out for reasons of public interest, on the basis of legal proceedings and in return for
compensation.

The compensation must correspond to the value of the investment, determined immediately
prior to the time when the actual or impending expropriation measures were made public. The
compensation must be paid without delay and, until it is paid, interest shall be calculated on the
amount of the compensation in accordance with the usual bank interest rate in the State in
whose territory the investment was made; it must be freely transferable. Provision shall be
made in an appropriate manner no later than the date of expropriation for determining and
paying compensation.

If a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is to be considered a
company of such Contracting Party under Article 1 para. 2 of this Agreement and in which an
investor of the other Contracting Party owns shares, the provisions of para. 1 above shall be
applied in such a way as to ensure adequate compensation of such an investor.

The investor shall have the right to have the legitimacy of the expropriation reviewed by the
competent authorities of the Contracting Party which prompted the expropriation.

(5) The investor shall have the right to have the amount of the compensation and the conditions of

(1

(2

£

(

(2

)

payment reviewed either by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party which
prompted the expropriation or by an arbitral tribunal according to Article 8 of this Agreement.

Article 5
Remittances

Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party free transfer

without delay in freely convertible currency of payments in connection with an investment, in

particular:

a) Capital and additional payments to maintain or increase an investment, including
management fees;

b) Earnings;

c) The repayment of loans;

d) The proceeds in case of a partial or complete liquidation or sale of the investment;

e) The compensation referred to in Article 4 para. 1 of this Agreement.

Remittances in accordance with this article shall be at the official rates of exchange in effect in
the territory of the Contracting Party on the date of remittance. The bank charges applied shall
be fair and appropriate.

Article 6
Succession in Rights

If a Contracting Party, or an institution authorized for that purpose, makes payments to its own
investor on the basis of a guarantee on an investment in the territory of the other Contracting
Party, that other Contracting Party shall recognize the assignment of all rights or claims of the
investor to the first-mentioned Contracting Party by operation of law or on the basis of a legal
transaction. This provision shall apply without prejudice to the rights of the investor of the first-
mentioned Contracting Party under article 8 and the rights of the first-mentioned Contracting
Party under article 9 of this Agreement.

Furthermore, the other Contracting Party shall recognize the subrogation by the first-
mentioned Contracting Party of all such rights or claims, to which the first-mentioned
Contracting Party shall be entitled to the same extent as its legal predecessor. Articles 4 and 5
of this Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis to the transfer of payments to be made to the
Contracting Party in question on the basis of the assigned claims.

Article 7
Other Obligations

If under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties or under international obligations now or in
the future undertaken between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Agreement there
exists a general or special regime whereby the investments of investors of the other Contracting
Party are accorded more favorable treatment than under this Agreement, the said regime shall
take precedence over the present Agreement to the extent that it is more favorable.

Investors of one Contracting Party may conclude special agreements with the other Contracting
Party, but the provisions thereof may not be in contradiction to this Agreement. The
investments made under such agreements shall be governed both by the provisions thereof and
by the provisions of this Agreement.

Article 8
Settlement of investment disputes

If disputes arise out of an investment, between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, concerning the amount or the conditions of payment of compensation
pursuant to Article 4, or the transfer obligations pursuant to Article 5, of this Agreement, they
shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the parties to the dispute.

If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph 1 above cannot be amicably settled within six
months as from the date of a written notice containing sufficiently specified claims, the dispute
shall, unless otherwise agreed, be decided upon the request of the Contracting Party or the
investor of the other Contracting Party by way of arbitral proceedings in accordance with the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, as effective for both Contracting Parties at the date of the motion
for the arbitration proceeding.

The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding; each Contracting Party shall ensure
the recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award in accordance with its own laws.

A Contracting Party which is a party to a dispute shall not, at any stage of the reconciliation or
arbitration proceedings or enforcement of an arbitral award, raise the objection that the
investor who is the other party to the dispute has received compensation by virtue of a
guarantee in respect of some or all of its losses.

Article 9
Disputes between the Contracting Parties

Disputes between Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this
Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled on an amicable basis.

If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph 1 cannot be settled within six months, it shall be
submitted to an arbitral tribunal at the request of either of the two Contracting Parties.

The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted on an ad hoc basis; each Contracting Party shall
appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators shall agree on a third person to act as chairman.
The arbitrators shall be appointed within three months from the date on which one Contracting
Party has informed the other that it wishes to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, and the
chairman shall be appointed within a further two months.

If the time-limits specified in paragraph 3 are not met, either Contracting Party may, in the
absence of any other agreement, request the President of the International Court of Justice to
make the necessary appointments. If the President of the International Court of Justice is a
national of one of the two Contracting Parties or is unable to act for any other reason, the Vice-

4

President or, if he is unable to act, the most senior member of the International Court of Justice
may under the same conditions be asked to make the appointments.

The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure.

The arbitral tribunal shall base its decision on this Agreement and on generally recognized rules
of international law. It shall decide by majority vote; its decision shall be final and binding.

Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator and of its representation in the
arbitration proceedings. The cost of the chairman and the other costs shall be shared equally by
the two Contracting Parties. The tribunal, however, may make a different ruling on costs in its
decision.

Article 10
Application of the Agreement

This Agreement shall apply to investments made or to be made in the territory of one of the
Contracting Parties in accordance with its legislation by investors of the other Contracting Party after
January 1, 1950.

Article 11
Entry into Force and Term

(1) This Agreement is subject to ratification and shall enter into force on the first day of the third

month that follows the month during which the instruments of ratification have been
exchanged.

The Agreement shall remain in force for ten years; upon the expiry of that period, it shall be
extended for an indefinite period of time and may be denounced by either Contracting Party
subject to twelve months' prior notice in writing through the diplomatic channel.

In the case of investments that will have been made before the date of denunciation of this
Agreement, articles 1 to 10 of this Agreement shall apply for a further ten years from that date.

Article 4
Compensation

Expropriation measures, including nationalization or other measures having the
same consequences, may be applied in the territory of the other Contracting
Party to investments of investors of a Contracting Party only in cases where
these expropriation measures are carried out for reasons of public interest, on the
basis of legal proceedings and in return for compensation.

The compensation must correspond to the value of the investment, determined
immediately prior to the time when the actual or impending expropriation
measures were made public. The compensation must be paid without delay and,
until it is paid, interest shall be calculated on the amount of the compensation in
accordance with the usual bank interest rate in the State in whose territory the
investment was made; it must be freely transferable. Provision shall be made in an
appropriate manner no later than the date of expropriation for determining and
paying compensation.

If a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is to be
considered a company of such Contracting Party under Article 1 para. 2 of this
Agreement and in which an investor of the other Contracting Party owns shares,
the provisions of para. 1 above shall be applied in such a way as to ensure
adequate compensation of such an investor.

The investor shall have the right to have the legitimacy of the expropriation
reviewed by the competent authorities of the Contracting Party which prompted
the expropriation.

conditions of payment reviewed either by the competent authorities of the
Contracting Party which prompted the expropriation or by an arbitral tribunal
according to Article 8 of this Agreement.

Article 5

including management fees;

b) Earnings;
c) | The repayment of loans;
d) The proceeds in case of a partial or complete liquidation or sale of the
investment;
e) The compensation referred to in Article 4 para. 1 of this Agreement.

exchange in effect in the territory of the Contracting Party on the date of

payments to its own investor on the basis of a guarantee on an investment in the
territory of the other Contracting Party, that other Contracting Party shall
recognize the assignment of all rights or claims of the investor to the first-
mentioned Contracting Party by operation of law or on the basis of a legal
transaction. This provision shall apply without prejudice to the rights of the
investor of the first-mentioned Contracting Party under article 8 and the rights
of the first-mentioned Contracting Party under article 9 of this Agreement.

Furthermore, the other Contracting Party shall recognize the subrogation by the
first-mentioned Contracting Party of all such rights or claims, to which the first-
mentioned Contracting Party shall be entitled to the same extent as its legal
predecessor. Articles 4 and 5 of this Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis to
the transfer of payments to be made to the Contracting Party in question on the
basis of the assigned claims.

Article 7
Other Obligations

If under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties or under international
obligations now or in the future undertaken between the Contracting Parties in
addition to this Agreement there exists a general or special regime whereby the
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party are accorded more
favorable treatment than under this Agreement, the said regime shall take
precedence over the present Agreement to the extent that it is more favorable.

Investors of one Contracting Party may conclude special agreements with the
other Contracting Party, but the provisions thereof may not be in contradiction
to this Agreement. The investments made under such agreements shall be
governed both by the provisions thereof and by the provisions of this
Agreement.

Article 8
Settlement of investment disputes

If disputes arise out of an investment, between a Contracting Party and an
investor of the other Contracting Party, concerning the amount or the conditions
of payment of a compensation pursuant to Article 4, or the transfer obligations
pursuant to Article 5, of this Agreement, they shall, as far as possible, be settled
amicably between the parties to the dispute.

If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph 1 above cannot be amicably settled
within six months as from the date of a written notice containing sufficiently
specified claims, the dispute shall, unless otherwise agreed, be decided upon the
request of the Contracting Party or the investor of the other Contracting Party by
way of arbitral proceedings in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules, as effective for both Contracting Parties at the date of the motion for the
arbitration proceeding.

>

The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding; each Contracting
Party shall ensure the recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award in
accordance with its own laws.

A Contracting Party which is a party to a dispute shall not, at any stage of the
reconciliation or arbitration proceedings or enforcement of an arbitral award,
raise the objection that the investor who is the other party to the dispute has
received compensation by virtue of a guarantee in respect of some or all of its
losses.

Article 9
Disputes between the Contracting Parties

Disputes between Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or
application of this Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled on an amicable
basis.

If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph 1 cannot be settled within six
months, it shall be submitted to an arbitral tribunal at the request of either of the
two Contracting Parties.

The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted on an ad hoc basis; each Contracting
Party shall appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators shall agree on a third
person to act as chairman. The arbitrators shall be appointed within three months
from the date on which one Contracting Party has informed the other that it
wishes to submit the dispute to an arbitral tribunal, and the chairman shall be
appointed within a further two months.

If the time-limits specified in paragraph 3 are not met, either Contracting Party
may,in the absence of any other agreement, request the President of the
International Court of Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the
President of the International Court of Justice is a national of one of the two
Contracting Parties or is unable to act for any other reason, the Vice-President
or, ifhe is unable to act, the most senior member of the International Court of
Justice may under the same conditions be asked to make the appointments.

The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure.
The arbitral tribunal shall base its decision on this Agreement and on generally

recognized rules of international law. It shall decide by majority vote; its
decision shall be final and binding.

Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator and of its
representation in the arbitration proceedings. The cost of the chairman and the
other costs shall be shared equally by the two Contracting Parties. The tribunal,
however, may make a different ruling on costs in its decision.

Article 10
Application of the Agreement

of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its legislation by investors of the other
Contracting Party after January 1, 1950.

AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE REPUBLIC OF AUSTRIA AND THE CZECH AND
SLOVAK FEDERAL REPUBLIC CONCERNING THE PROMOTION AND
PROTECTION OF INVESTMENTS

The Republic of Austria and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, hereinafter referred to as
the “Contracting Parties”.

DESIRING to develop friendly relations in accordance with the principles of the Final Act of
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, signed on August 1, 1975 in Helsinki,
and desiring to create favourable conditions for greater economic cooperation between the
Contracting Parties,

RECOGNIZING that the promotion and protection of investments may strengthen the
readiness to make such investments and thereby make an important contribution to the

development of economic relations,

HAVE AGREED AS FOLLOWS:

Article 1
Definitions
For the purposes of this Agreement:
(1) The term “investment” shall mean all assets that are invested by an investor of one

Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its
legislation, in particular:

a) Movable and immovable property, as well as all rights in rem;

b) Shares and other forms of participation in enterprises;

c) Claims or titles to money that was transferred to create an economic value, or claims
to performances having an economic value;

rights such as patents, trademarks, industrial designs, models and samples, technical
processes, know-how, business names and goodwill;

e) Concessions under public law for prospecting, mining or extracting of natural

resources;
(2) “Investor” shall mean, in the case of the Republic of Austria:

a) any natural person, who has the citizenship of the Republic of Austria and who
makes an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party;

b) any legal entity or partnership under commercial law, which was established in
accordance with the laws of the Republic of Austria, has its seat in the territory of
the Republic of Austria, and makes an investment in the territory of the other
Contracting Party;

and in the case of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic:

any legal entity, which was established in accordance with the Czechoslovak laws,
which has its seat in the territory of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, and
makes an investment in the territory of the other Contracting Party;

“Earnings” shall mean the amounts yielded by an investment and includes, in particular,
profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties and license fees.

Article 2
Promotion and protection of investments

Each Contracting Party shall, to the extent possible, promote investments made in its
territory by investors from the other Contracting Party, shall permit such investments in
accordance with its laws and shall accord them just and equitable treatment.

Investments and the earnings yielded by investments shall have the full protection of
this Agreement. In case of reinvestment, the same shall also apply to earnings yielded by
such reinvestment. Legal extension or alteration of the investment shall be in accordance
with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment
is made.

Article 3
Treatment of Investments

Each Contracting Party shall accord to investors of the other Contracting Party and to
their investments treatment that is no less favourable than that which it accords to its
own investors or to investors of any third states and their investments.

The provisions of para. 1, however, shall not apply to present or future privileges
granted by one Contracting Party to investors of a third state or their investments in
connection with

a) an economic union, customs union, a common market, free trade zone or economic
community;

Article 4
Compensation

Investments by Investors of one Contracting Party may only be expropriated,
nationalized or subject to other measures having similar effect in the territory of the
other Contracting Party for reasons of public interest, on the basis of legal proceedings
and in return for compensation.

The compensation must correspond to the value of the investment immediately prior to
the time when the actual or impending expropriation measures became publicly known.
The compensation must be paid without delay and, until payment, shall yield interest
based on the customary bank interest rate of the State in whose territory the investment
was made; it must be freely transferable. At the time of expropriation at the latest,
provisions shall have been made in an appropriate manner for determining and paying
compensation.

If a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is to be considered a
company of that Contracting Party under Article 1 para. 2 of this Agreement and in
which an investor of the other Contracting Party owns shares, the provisions of para. 1
above shall be applied in such a way as to ensure adequate compensation of such an
investor.

The investor shall have the right to have the legality of the expropriation reviewed by
the competent authorities of the Contracting Party which prompted the expropriation.

The investor shall have the right to have the amount of the compensation and the
method of payment reviewed either by the competent authorities of the Contracting

Party which prompted the expropriation or by an arbitral tribunal in accordance with
Article 8 of this Agreement.

Article 5
Remittances
Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to investors of the other Contracting Party free
transfer without delay in freely convertible currency of payments in connection with an

investment, in particular:

a

Capital and additional payments to maintain or increase an investment, including its
management;

b

2

Earnings;

¢

The repayment of loans;
d

The proceeds in case of a complete or partial liquidation or sale of the investment;

Remittances in accordance with this article shall be at the official rates of exchange in
effect in the territory of the Contracting Party on the date of remittance. The bank
charges applied shall be just and adequate.

Article 6
Succession in Rights

If a Contracting Party, or an institution authorized for that purpose, makes payments to
its own investor on the basis of a guarantee on an investment in the territory of the other
Contracting Party, that other Contracting Party shall recognize the assignment of all
rights or claims of the investor to the first mentioned Contracting Party by operation of
law or on the basis of a legal transaction. This provision shall apply without prejudice to
the rights of the investor of the first-mentioned Contracting Party under article 8 and the
rights of the first-mentioned Contracting Party under article 9 of this Agreement.

Furthermore, the other Contracting Party shall recognize the subrogation by the first-
mentioned Contracting Party of all such rights or claims, to which the first mentioned
Contracting Party shall be entitled to the same extent as its legal predecessor. Articles 4
and 5 of this Agreement shall apply mutatis mutandis to the transfer of payments to be
made to the Contracting Party in question on the basis of the assigned claims.

Article 7
Other Obligations

If under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties or under international obligations
now or in the future undertaken between the Contracting Parties in addition to this
Agreement there exists a general or special regime whereby the investments of investors
of the other Contracting Party are accorded more favourable treatment than under this
Agreement, the said regime shall take precedence over the present Agreement to the
extent that it is more favourable.

Investors of one Contracting Party may conclude special agreements with the other
Contracting Party, but the provisions thereof may not be in contradiction to this
Agreement. The investments made under such agreements shall be governed both by the
provisions thereof and by the provisions of this Agreement.

Article 8
Settlement of investment disputes
If disputes arise between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting

Party concerning an investment with regard to the amount or the arrangements for
payment of compensation in accordance with Article 4, or to the transfer obligations in

accordance with Article 5 of this Agreement, they shall, as far as possible be settled
between the parties to the dispute on an amicable basis.

If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph 1 above cannot be settled within six
months as from a written notice of sufficiently specific claims, the dispute shall, unless
otherwise agreed, be decided upon the request of the Contracting Party or the investor of
the other Contracting Party by way of arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules in the version in effect on the date of the request to initiate arbitration.

The award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding; each Contracting Party shall
ensure the recognition and enforcement of the arbitral award in accordance with its own
laws.

A Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not, at any stage of the
arbitration or enforcement of an arbitral award, raise the objection that the investor who
is the other party to the dispute has received compensation by virtue of a guarantee in
respect of some or all of its losses.

Article 9
Disputes between the Contracting Parties

Disputes between Contracting Parties concerning the interpretation or application of this
Agreement shall, as far as possible, be settled on an amicable basis.

If a dispute within the meaning of paragraph | cannot be settled within six months, it
shall be submitted to an arbitral tribunal at the request of either of the two Contracting
Parties.

The arbitral tribunal shall be constituted on an ad hoc basis; each Contracting Party shall
appoint one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators shall agree on a third person to act as
chairman. The arbitrators shall be appointed within three months from the date on which
one Contracting Party has informed the other that it wishes to submit the dispute to an
arbitral tribunal, and the chairman shall be appointed within a further two months.

If the time-limits specified in paragraph 3 are not met, either Contracting Party may, in
the absence of any other agreement, request the President of the International Court of
Justice to make the necessary appointments. If the President of the International Court of
Justice is a national of one of the two Contracting Parties or is unable to act for any
other reason, the Vice-President or, if he is unable to act, the most senior member of the
International Court of Justice may under the same conditions be asked to make the
appointments.

The arbitral tribunal shall determine its own procedure.
The arbitral tribunal shall base its decision on this Agreement and on generally
recognized rules of international law. It shall decide by majority vote; its decision shall

be final and binding.

Each Contracting Party shall bear the cost of its own arbitrator and of its representation
in the arbitration proceedings. The cost of the chairman and the other costs shall be

shared equally by the two Contracting Parties. The tribunal, however, may make a
different ruling on costs in its decision.

Article 10
Application of the Agreement
This Agreement shall be applicable to investments that investors of one Contracting Party

have made or will make in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its
laws after 1 January 1950.

Article 11
Entry into Force and Term

(1) This Agreement is subject to ratification and shall enter into force on the first day of the
third month that follows the month in which the instruments of ratification have been
exchanged.

(2) The Agreement shall remain in force for ten years; upon the expiry of that period, it
shall be extended for an indefinite period of time and may be denounced by either
Contracting Party subject to twelve months’ prior notice in writing through the
diplomatic channel.

(3) In the case of investments that will have been made before the date of denunciation of

this Agreement, articles 1 to 10 of this Agreement shall apply for a further ten years
from that date.
