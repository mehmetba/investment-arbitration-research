SUMMARY OF THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY

This arbitration concerns a legal dispute between Saint-Gobain and Venezuela arising out of
Venezuela’s alleged refusal to compensate Saint-Gobain for the expropriation of Saint-Go-
bain’s investment in its 99.99%! subsidiary Norpro Venezuela C.A. (“Norpro Venezuela”
or “Norpro”) following a televised speech of Venezuela’s President Hugo Chavez on 15
May 2010. Claimant alleges that Respondent breached the Agreement on Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Government of the French Republic and
the Government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the “France-Venezuela-BIT” or
the “Treaty’’), which entered into force on 15 April 2004, by refusing to offer compensation
for the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela’s proppants plant in Puerto Ordaz, Bolivar State,
as well as by sanctioning or failing to intervene in the increase of the price for the supply of
bauxite allegedly in breach of a contract entered into with a State-owned entity, thus failing
to treat Claimant fairly and equitably and to accord its investment full protection and security,
in violation of Articles 5(1) and 3(1) and (2) of the Treaty.

On 25 May 2012, Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration against Respondent (the “Re-
quest’) with the Secretary-General of ICSID in accordance with Article 36 of the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the
“ICSID Convention”) and the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and
Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Institution Rules”).

On 29 May 2012, the Secretariat of ICSID (the “Secretariat”) transmitted the Request to
Respondent.

On 15 June 2012, the Secretary-General registered Claimant’s Request in accordance with
Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and Rules 6 and 7 of the ICSID Institution Rules and
notified the Parties of such registration. The case was assigned the ICSID Case Number
ARB/12/13.

On 28 September 2012, Claimant appointed Judge Charles N. Brower, a national of the
United States of America, as arbitrator.

On 3 October 2012, Respondent appointed Mr. Gabriel Bottini, a national of the Argentine
Republic, as arbitrator.

' One share is held by Mr. Luis Péez, a Venezuelan national and the President of Norpro Venezuela, who subscribed
a single share when Norpro Venezuela was incorporated. The planned transfer of Mr. Péez’s share to Saint-Gobain has
not yet been completed. Request, | 4, note 4.

On 4 October 2012, Judge Brower accepted his appointment as arbitrator by Claimant, having
provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration Rules”).

On 25 October 2012, Mr. Bottini accepted his appointment as arbitrator by Respondent, hav-
ing provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules.

On 12 November 2012, the Secretary-General informed Prof. Dr. Klaus Sachs that the Parties
agreed on his appointment as President of the Tribunal. By letter of 14 November 2012, Prof.
Sachs accepted his appointment, having provided a duly signed declaration to the Secretariat
in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

On 26 November 2012, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Prof. Sachs, Judge
Brower and Mr. Bottini had accepted their appointments as arbitrators and, accordingly, pur-
suant to Rules 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal was deemed to have been
constituted and the proceedings to have begun as of such date; in addition, Ms. Natali Se-
queira was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal (the “Secretary”).

Following the exchange of written submissions and an oral hearing held in Washington, D.C.,
USA from 2 to 6 February 2015, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Liability and the
Principles of Quantum on 30 December 2016 (the “Decision’”), which forms an integral part
of the Award. For the summary of the procedural history leading up to the issuance of the
Decision, reference is made to Section C. of the Decision.

In the operative part of its Decision, the Tribunal held:

1. Respondent has breached Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty
by failing to specify the amount of compensation and to pay prompt com-
pensation for the expropriation of Claimant’s investment in Venezuela.

2. Respondent shall pay to Claimant the amount of compensation to be calcu-
lated on the basis of the Tribunal’s findings summarized at paragraphs 849
through 851 above, plus pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010 until the date
of the Award at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury
bill rate, compounded annually.

3. Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the amount of
compensation under 2 as of the date of the Award until the date of payment

at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, com-
pounded annually. Post-award interest is to be paid only on the principal
amount of compensation, and not on the pre-award interest awarded.

4. The award of damages and interest is made net of applicable Venezuelan
taxes, and Respondent may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of
the award of damages and interest.

5. The decision on costs is reserved for the Award.
6. All other claims and requests are dismissed.
On 11 January 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it ordered:

The Parties are invited to liaise in an attempt to reach agreement on the final
amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the
expropriation of Norpro Venezuela — based on the Tribunal’s findings summa-
rized in paragraphs 849 to 851 of the Tribunal’s Decision on Liability and the
Principles of Quantum.

The Parties shall inform the Tribunal within two months from the notification of
the Decision, i.e., by Wednesday, 1 March 2017, whether and to what extent they
have been able to reach agreement on the matter set out under paragraph 3 above.

In case the Parties have not been able to reach agreement on the final amount of
compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant by 1 March 2017, the Tri-
bunal will invite the Parties to agree on, or failing agreement to submit their re-
spective proposals for, a calendar for submissions of the Parties on the remaining
quantum issues to be decided.

By e-mail of 17 February 2017, the Parties jointly requested an extension of the 1 March
2017 deadline identified in paragraph 4 of Procedural Order No. 4 to 31 March 2017. By e-
mail of 18 February 2017, the Tribunal granted the Parties’ extension request.

By letter of 30 March 2017, Respondent filed its submission on the final amount of compen-
sation to be awarded to Claimant based on the findings made by the Tribunal in its Decision.
In particular, it presented four figures calculated by the Parties’ experts using their respective
DCF models and proposed that the Parties agree on the second highest of these four amounts,
i.e., the amount derived by Respondent’s expert using its own economic model.

By letter of 31 March 2017, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it considered the results of
the application of the DCF method based on the parameters set out by the Tribunal in its
Decision inconsistent with the standard of compensation mandated by the Treaty and cus-
tomary international law and requested that the Tribunal direct the Parties to confer and pro-
pose a calendar for submissions on the quantum issues to be decided.

Following the exchange of further submissions between the Parties as regards the necessity
to file new submissions on quantum and as regards Claimant’s requests for reconsideration
and correction of the Tribunal’s Decision, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Claimant’s
Requests for Reconsideration and Correction on 28 June 2017 (the “Reconsideration Deci-
sion”). For a detailed summary of the submissions exchanged prior to the issuance of the
Reconsideration Decision, reference is made to Section A. of the Reconsideration Decision.

In the cover letter dated 28 June 2017, transmitted to the Parties together with the Reconsid-
eration Decision, the Tribunal made reference to paragraph 89 of the Reconsideration Deci-
sion, where it expressed the view that it was not yet in a position to determine the final amount
of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of
Claimant’s investment without providing Claimant with the opportunity to comment on the
contents of Respondent’s letter of 30 March 2017. The Tribunal therefore invited Claimant
to file its comments, in particular on Respondent’s proposal to adopt the second highest of
four figures calculated by the Parties’ experts on the basis of the Tribunal’s findings in its
Decision as the final amount of compensation, by 12 July 2017.

By letter of 12 July 2017, Claimant commented on Respondent’s letter of 30 March 2017
and, in particular and without prejudice to its previous submissions made in the context of its
requests for reconsideration and correction, agreed with Respondent’s proposal to adopt the
second highest of four amounts. Claimant further requested leave to amend its submission on
costs in light of additional fees and costs incurred subsequent to the last cost update in No-
vember 2015.

In its letter of 14 July 2017, the Tribunal invited both Parties to submit any updates to the
Cost Submissions that they wished to be considered in the Tribunal’s decision on costs to be
included in the Award by 28 July 2017.

On 28 July 2017, Claimant filed an updated cost submission (“Claimant’s Updated Cost
Submission”). On the same date, Respondent filed an additional cost submission (“Respond-
ent’s Additional Cost Submission”).

On 7 August 2017, the Centre informed the Parties and the Tribunal that Mr. Francisco Grob,
ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Ms. Sequeira as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 20 September 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed pursuant to Rule 38(1)
of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A detailed summary of the background facts that are not disputed between the Parties, or
which have otherwise been established by the evidence submitted in these proceedings to the
satisfaction of the Tribunal has been set out in Section D. of the Decision.

PARTIES” POSITIONS

For detailed summaries of the Parties’ positions on liability and quantum as argued in their
written submissions and during the Hearing, reference is made to Sections E. and F. of the
Decision.

Further to the Tribunal’s Decision, which dealt with the question of Respondent’s liability
under the Treaty and the principles of quantum applicable to the determination of the amount
of compensation, the remaining issues to be addressed in this Award are: (i) the exact amount
of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of its
investment based on the findings made by the Tribunal in its Decision; and (ii) the allocation
of the costs of the arbitration and the legal fees and costs incurred by the Parties in connection
with this arbitration.

AGREED AMOUNT OF QUANTUM AND JOINT PROPOSAL

In its letter of 30 March 2017, Respondent presented the results which had been calculated
by the Parties’ experts, who had each run their own and the other Party’s expert’s economic
model based on the Tribunal’s findings in its Decision, and exchanged between the Parties
on 7 March 2017. These results were as follows:

On that basis, Respondent proposed that the Parties agree on the final amount of compensa-
tion derived by its expert using his own economic model, i.e., an amount of USD 34.4 million
(including interest through to 31 March 2017).

Upon invitation from the Tribunal to comment on Respondent’s letter of 30 March 2017 and
in particular the above mentioned proposal after the Tribunal’s Reconsideration Decision had
been rendered on 28 June 2017, Claimant stated in its letter of 12 July 2017 that: (i) Respond-
ent’s letter accurately reflected the four amounts calculated by the Parties’ experts on the
basis of the parameters set out in the Tribunal’s Decision; and (ii) without prejudice to its
previous submissions made in the context of its requests for reconsideration and correction
of the Tribunal’s Decision, it agreed with Respondent’s proposal to adopt the second highest
of these four amounts, i.e., USD 34.4 million including interest through to 31 March 2017.

SUMMARIES OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON COSTS

Both Parties request that the Tribunal order reimbursement by the other Party of the costs
they have incurred, respectively. In the following, the positions of the Parties on costs, as
argued in their written submissions will be summarized.

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13 Page 13 of 25

1. Summary of Claimant’s Position on Costs

35. Claimant submits that in light of the Tribunal’s finding in its Decision that Respondent
breached Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, Respondent should be ordered to
bear the entirety of Claimant’s costs plus compound interest calculated annually from the
date of the Award until the date of payment by Venezuela.”

36. Claimant submits that the Tribunal’s authority to assess and apportion the costs between the
Parties is derived from Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which is generally understood
broadly so as to include: (i) fees, allowances and any other expenses incurred by attorneys
and experts; and (ii) all travel expenses and costs incurred by witnesses, advisors and repre-
sentatives of the Parties.

37. Claimant further submits that a tribunal should exercise its authority to award costs and to
apply the rule of “costs follow the event’ particularly in cases where a respondent State has
breached its treaty obligations. According to Claimant, tribunals “have consistently awarded
the claimant all or a portion of its reasonable costs” in such circumstances. Claimant makes
reference to ADC v. Hungary and Gold Reserve, where the tribunals linked their costs award
to the principle of full reparation established in Chorzéw.‘ Claimant further quotes from an
authority who considers that “there is a case for treating the arbitration costs incurred by a
claimant who is found to have suffered damages at the hands of a State (or vice versa) as
being among the ‘natural, normal and predictable consequences of the damage inflicted.””°

38. Claimant argues that it is not necessary for a claimant to prevail on each of its claims in order
to be eligible for reimbursement of its reasonable costs and refers to the tribunal in Hochtief
v. Argentina, which considered it sufficient that “the core of the claim ha{d] been upheld”
and that the claimant was “entitled to reparation for the losses caused by Respondent’s vio-
lation of Claimant’s rights under the BIT.”® According to Claimant, the logic of full repara-

Al.

tion mandates that “as long as there has been some breach of a claimant’s treaty rights re-
quiring resort to arbitration, a costs award is necessary to put the claimant back in the posi-
tion it would have been in had the breach never occurred.”"

Claimant claims that the tribunals in OJ European v. Venezuela and Flughafen Ziirich v. Ven-
ezuela applied this approach by requiring Venezuela to pay for the costs of the proceeding
and a substantial part of the claimant’s reasonable legal costs, respectively. In addition,
Claimant makes reference to the decision in Tidewater v. Venezuela, where the tribunal held
that the expropriation was lawful but nevertheless awarded costs to the claimants, holding
that “[t]he result is that [claimants] have been put to a great deal of time, trouble and ex-
penses in order to obtain compensation that Venezuela had vouchsafed to provide under the
terms of the Barbados BIT and ought to have so provided in 2009.”

Claimant notes that Respondent does not challenge the Tribunal’s authority to grant a costs
award but rather seeks one itself, relying on Claimant’s non-participation in the procedures
provided under Venezuelan law for the determination of the compensation due to Claimant.
In response to that argument, Claimant emphasizes that it would not have had to participate
in such proceedings if Respondent had complied with its obligations under the Treaty and
Venezuelan law by providing Claimant with adequate compensation at the time of expropri-
ation. As a result of Respondent’s failure to do so, Claimant argues that it had to initiate legal
action, which resulted in delays that cost it significant time and financial resources. '°

In Claimant’s view, the fact that its challenge and application for provisional measures were
not successful cannot serve as grounds to deviate from the principle of full reparation, arguing
that “good-faith procedural conduct resulting in a minor delay” does not justify awarding
costs to the opposing party. Claimant refers to the case of Postovd Banka v. Hellenic Republic
where the tribunal did not make a costs order despite ruling in favor of the respondent on
jurisdiction, holding that the “issue was not clear-cut and involved a complex factual and
legal background. Each side presented valid arguments in support of its respective case and

acted fairly and professionally.”

!? Claimant’s Cost Submi
'3 Claimant’

On the other hand, Claimant claims that an adjustment to the costs award may be warranted
“in light of extreme conduct or abuse of process by parties, including deliberate obstruction
of proceedings,” which it considers to be the case here due to Respondent’s refusal to pay its
share of the advances on costs as required by ICSID Regulation 14(3)(d). Claimant argues
that Respondent thereby “threatened the continuity of the proceedings” and forced it to pay
Respondent’s share to avoid discontinuance of the proceedings. Claimant refers to the deci-
sion in Venoklim v. Venezuela, where the tribunal took note of Venezuela’s similar conduct
and ordered it to reimburse the claimant for its unpaid share of the advance on costs.”

Based on the above and pursuant to Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, Claimant seeks
reimbursement of: (i) the advances of fees and expenses of the members of theTribunal and
ICSID’s administrative fees; (ii) the travel costs and expenses of Claimant’s witnesses and
party representatives; and (iii) the costs of its legal representation, independent experts and
consultants.'* According to Claimant’s Updated Cost Submission filed on 28 July 2017,
Claimant has incurred the following costs: !4

plus compound interest calculated annually at a commercial rate from the date of
the Award until the date of payment by Venezuela:

(i) | USD 1,425,000.00, which corresponds to the advances on the fees and ex-

Saint-Gobain’s counsel Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer US LLP, Hughes

penses of Saint-Gobain’s legal expert, Dr. Brewer-Carias, and USD
15,512.26, which corresponds to the fees and expenses of Saint-Gobain’s
technology consultants, FTI Consulting and Immersion Legal Graphics,

(iv) USD 1,652,172.11, which corresponds to the fees and expenses of Saint-
Gobain’s valuation expert, Compass Lexecon.

3. Summary of Respondent’s Position on Costs

45. Respondent agrees with Claimant that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention grants the Tri-
bunal authority to assess by whom the expenses of the Parties, as well as the fees and ex-
penses of the Tribunal and charges for the use of ICSID facilities, shall be borne.'”

46. Respondent submits that ICSID tribunals often exercise their discretion by awarding costs to
the party that prevailed in the arbitration proceedings and claims that it should be considered

the prevailing party in this case. Respondent makes reference to Claimant’s request to recon-
sider the Tribunal’s Decision, which was unanimously rejected, and to the figures derived by
the Parties’ experts based on the Tribunal’s findings. Respondent notes that all of these fig-
ures, which range from USD 23 million to USD 30 million (excluding pre-award interest)
are “far lower than the grossly exaggerated amounts that Claimant demanded throughout the
case,” i.e., USD 99.5 million as of 15 May 2010 or USD 120.5 million as of 31 May 2014.18

Respondent further invokes Claimant’s refusal to participate in the procedures for determin-
ing compensation under Venezuelan law and its request for provisional measures against
those procedures, which, in Respondent’s view, “frustrated their implementation.” Accord-
ing to Respondent, there would have been no need to incur the expenses of this arbitration if
Claimant had “taken a reasonable position” in this regard.'?

Respondent argues that “[i]n light of Claimant’s strategic decision not to participate in the
procedures provided under Venezuelan law for the determination of just compensation and
instead to engage in tacticts to delay such a determination, and given Claimant’s grossly

excessive compensation demand in this case,” Claimant should be ordered to bear all of the

costs incurred by the Parties as well as the costs of the arbitration.”°

Pursuant to Respondent’s Additional Cost Submission filed on 28 July 2017, Respondent has
incurred the following costs:

4. Respondent’s Relief Sought

Respondent requests that the Tribunal award costs against Claimant and, in this case, imple-
ment that decision by deducting from the final amount of compensation determined by the
Tribunal all of Respondent’s costs indicated in the updated Cost Submission of 23 November
2015 and in the Additional Cost Submission.”!

THE TRIBUNAL’S REASONING

THE PARTIES’ AGREEMENT ON QUANTUM

As noted above, the Parties have reached agreement on the final amount of compensation to
be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela based
on the findings contained in the Tribunal’s Decision. This consent is expressed in Respond-
ent’s letter of 30 March 2017 and Claimant’s letter of 12 July 2017.

Based on the agreement reached between the Parties, the Tribunal therefore determines that
the final amount of compensation to be paid by Respondent to Claimant in respect of the
expropriation of its investment, calculated on the basis of the Tribunal’s findings summarized
at paragraphs 849 through 851 of its Decision, amounts to USD 34.4 million. This amount
includes pre-award interest as of 15 May 2010 through to 31 March 2017 in the amount of
USD 4.8 million.

Respondent shall further pay to Claimant pre-award interest, calculated at a rate equal to 2%
over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually, from 1 April 2017
until the date of this Award.

Finally, Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest as determined by the Tribunal
in its Decision. Such interest shall start to accrue from the 30" day following the date of this
Award.

DECISION ON Costs

There is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal’s authority to render a decision
on the allocation of costs is based on Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the
fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use
of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of
the Award.”

 

There is further common ground that the Tribunal’s discretion to “assess the expenses in-
curred by the parties” extends to all costs incurred by the Parties in connection with the
arbitration proceedings, i.e., including the fees charged for their legal representation and val-
uation experts.

The Tribunal will thus exercise its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention
and decide on the allocation of: (i) the costs of the arbitration, which includes the adminis-
trative fees charged by ICSID as well as the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribu-
nal; and (ii) the fees and expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with this arbitration.

1. The Costs of the Arbitration

First, the Tribunal will address the question of who shall bear the costs of the arbitration. As
to the advances on costs paid in this regard, the Tribunal notes that, in accordance with Reg-
ulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, ICSID requested the
Parties to pay each of the respective advances on costs in equal shares. Respondent, however,
has not paid its 50% share pursuant to any of the advance payment requests issued by ICSID
over the course of this proceeding. Upon request, Claimant has therefore paid its own as well
as Respondent’s share of the advances on costs in the total amount of USD 1,425,000.

Case 1:18-mc-00343-UNA Document 2-1 Filed 12/12/18 Page 22 of 27 PagelD #: 35

ICSID Case No. ARB/12/13 Page 20 of 25

59.

60.

61.

62.

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Respondent’s refusal to pay its share of the advances
on costs constitutes a breach of the ICSID procedural framework, which the Tribunal will
take into account in its decision on the allocation of the arbitration costs.

The Tribunal further recalls its finding in the Decision that Respondent has breached Article
5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty by failing to specify the amount of compensation
and to pay prompt compensation for the expropriation of Claimant’s investment.”? At the
same time, the Tribunal notes that it did not make a finding on whether Respondent has
breached its own domestic laws concerning the expropriation process and whether any such
breach amounted to a lack of due process as alleged by Claimant in this proceeding.”?

In any event and irrespective of whether Respondent’s conduct was in compliance or in
breach of its own expropriation laws, the Tribunal notes that, to its knowledge, Respondent
has to date, i.e., more than seven years after the expropriation date, not paid any amount of
compensation to Claimant and has not deposited any amount of preliminary compensation
with a competent court in Venezuela — despite the fact that it has always recognized the oc-
curence of an expropriation that requires payment of just compensation. In this context, the
Tribunal cannot follow Respondent’s argument that Claimant’s request for provisional
measures frustrated the implementation of Venezuelan procedures for determining compen-
sation,”* given that the Tribunal decided in its Procedural Order No. 3 to deny Claimant’s
request in full and thus refrained from ordering Respondent to discontinue any domestic pro-
ceedings related to the expropriation of Norpro Venezuela.

Against this background and taking into account Respondent’s failure to comply with the
requirements of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and 3 of the Treaty, the Tribunal agrees with
Claimant that it was forced by Respondent’s conduct to initiate this arbitration proceeding in
order to obtain adequate compensation for the expropriation of its investment in Venezuela.>>
Consequently, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent shall bear the costs of

the arbitration, which amount to (in USD):?°

Direct expenses?” 149,488.26
Total 1,303,189.99

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders Respondent to pay Claimant USD 1,303,189.99 for the ex-
pended portion of the advances to ICSID.”*

2. The Costs Incurred by the Parties in Connection with this Arbitration

Second, the Tribunal will assess the question of who shall bear the fees and expenses incurred
by the Parties in connection with this arbitration. At the outset, the Tribunal notes that neither
Party has raised any objection to the reasonableness of the costs incurred by the other Party
and that, in fact, the total costs that each of them incurred are within a similar range of ap-
proximately USD 6.5-7 million.

For the reasons set out above, in particular given that Claimant had to initiate the present
arbitration proceeding to obtain compensation, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Re-
spondent shall bear a certain portion of the costs incurred by Claimant in connection with this
proceeding. In its assessment of the specific portion that should be borne by Respondent, the
Tribunal has particularly taken into account the following considerations.

First, the Tribunal recalls that while it has found a breach of Article 5(1) subparagraphs 2 and
3 of the Treaty and left open whether there was a breach of due process in the expropriation
process, it denied Claimant’s Bauxite Claims, i.e., its claims that Respondent breached Arti-
cle 3(1) and 3(2) of the Treaty by virtue of the increase of the bauxite price that was initially
agreed upon in the Bauxite Contract entered into between Claimant and CVG Bauxilum.”?

27 This amount includes charges relating to the dispatch of the Award (courier, printing and copying).
°8 The remaining balance of the advances will be reimbursed to Claimant.

Second, as for quantum, the Tribunal recalls that while Claimant requested in its final sub-
mission to be awarded compensation in the amount of USD 99.5 million plus pre-award in-
terest as of 15 May 2010,*° Respondent requested that compensation should be awarded in
the amount of USD 9.5 million excluding pre-award interest.*! Respondent argues that in
light of the amount agreed upon by the Parties pursuant to the Tribunal’s findings in its De-
cision, i.e., USD 29.6 million excluding pre-award interest, it should be considered the pre-
vailing party in this arbitration.*? The Tribunal cannot agree with this characterization. Apart
from the Tribunal’s finding on liability that Respondent has breached its obligations under
the Treaty, the Tribunal notes that as a result of its findings on the principles of quantum,
Claimant is entitled to approximately 30% of what it has requested or to more than 300% of
the compensation that Respondent has considered just in the context of this arbitration.

As pointed out by Respondent,* Claimant has further initiated three incidental proceedings,
ie., (i) a request to disqualify arbitrator Bottini; (ii) a request for provisional measures di-
rected at discontinuing all domestic proceedings in Venezuela related to the expropriation of
Norpro Venezuela; and (iii) a request for reconsideration and correction of the Tribunal’s
Decision. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary at this stage to express an opinion as
to whether each of these three requests was “substantial and properly required the Tribunal’s
consideration,” as was the case in Tidewater v. Venezuela on which Claimant relies in this
regard.** In the Tribunal’s view, it suffices to note for the present purposes that all three
requests were unsuccessful.

Taking into account all of the above considerations, the Tribunal does not consider it justified
to order that Respondent shall bear the entirety of the costs incurred by Claimant in connec-
tion with this arbitration. The Tribunal is of the view that it is appropriate for Respondent to
bear two thirds of the costs incurred by Claimant. Consequently, Respondent shall reimburse
Claimant with an amount of USD 4,634,532.05.

3. Interest on Costs Award

As a final matter, Claimant requests that Respondent be ordered to reimburse its costs, plus
compound interest calculated annually at a commercial rate from the date of the Award until
the date of payment by Venezuela.

The Tribunal considers it appropriate to award interest on the amount of costs that Respond-
ent is ordered to reimburse at the same post-award interest rate as on the principal amount of
compensation, i.e., at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate,
compounded annually. Such interest shall start to accrue from the 30" day following the date
of this Award.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

Based on the above, the Tribunal*> renders the following

AWARD

1. Respondent shall pay to Claimant within 30 days of the date of this Award: (i)

USD 29.6 million as principal amount of compensation for the expropriation of
Claimant’s investment in Venezuela; and (ii) USD 4.8 million as pre-award in-
terest as of 15 May 2010 through to 31 March 2017.

Respondent shall further pay to Claimant within 30 days of the date of this
Award pre-award interest on the principal amount of compensation under 1, i.e.,
USD 29.6 million, as of 1 April 2017 until the date of this Award at a rate equal
to 2% over the average 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually.

Subject to the limitation that post-award interest is to be paid only on the prin-
cipal amount of compensation, and not on the pre-award interest awarded, Re-
spondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the principal amount of
compensation under 1, i.e., USD 29.6 million, as from the 30" day following the
date of this Award until the date of payment at a rate equal to 2% over the av-

erage 6-month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually.

+5 Arbitrator Bottini believes that, whenever an ICSID tribunal exercises its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID
Convention and enters an adjusted costs order (i.e., ordering one party to pay the other party’s costs or the tribunal’s
costs, in full or in part), two relevant factors to be considered are the extent to which the claimants’ damages claim has
been granted and who has prevailed in any incidental proceeding decided in the arbitration. Arbitrator Bottini finds
that the Tribunal’s decision on costs reflects neither of these two factors.

The award of damages and interest is made net of applicable Venezuelan taxes,
and Respondent may not deduct taxes in respect of the payment of the award
of damages and interest.

Respondent shall bear the costs of the arbitration, i.e., the fees and expenses of
the members of the Tribunal as well as the charges for the use of the facilities
of ICSID, in full. Consequently, Respondent shall reimburse Claimant with an
amount of USD 1,303,189.99 within 30 days of the date of this Award.

Respondent shall further bear two thirds of the costs incurred by Claimant in
connection with this arbitration proceeding and thus reimburse Claimant with
an amount of USD 4,634,532.05 within 30 days of the date of this Award.

Respondent shall pay to Claimant post-award interest on the amount of costs
to be reimbursed under 5 and 6 as from the 30" day following the date of this
Award until the date of payment at a rate equal to 2% over the average 6-
month US Treasury bill rate, compounded annually.

All other claims and requests are dismissed.
