Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

L INTRODUCTION

A. Request for Arbitration

On 16 February 2010, Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A.,
Twenty Grand Offshore, L.L.C., Point Marine, L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C.,
Jackson Marine, L.L.C. and Zapata Gulf Marine Operators, L.L.C. (together ‘Tidewater’ or
‘Claimants’) filed a Request for Arbitration under the ICSID Arbitration Rules against the

Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (‘Venezuela’ or ‘Respondent’).

The dispute concerns the Claimants’ investment in marine support services to the oil
industry in Venezuela. Venezuela’s national oil company Petrdleos de Venezuela, S.A.
(‘PDVSA’) engaged private companies to provide support to the oil industry in the country.
One of these private companies was Tidewater Marine Service, C.A. (‘SEMARCA’), a
company constituted under the laws of Venezuela. SEMARCA contracted with PDVSA and
two other national or semi-national companies, PDVSA Petrdleo, S.A. (‘PDVSA Petréleo’) and
PetroSucre, S.A. (‘PetroSucre’) to provide support both at Lake Maracaibo and offshore in

the Gulf of Paria.

Prior to February 2009, SEMARCA was owned by Tidewater Caribe, C.A.

 

idewater Caribe’),
a company incorporated in Venezuela, which in turn was owned by Tidewater Marine
International, Inc. (‘Tidewater Marine’), a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.
That company was in turn owned by Tidewater Inc. (a company incorporated in the United
States of America). In addition, a number of other United States — and Cayman Islands —
incorporated subsidiaries of Tidewater Inc. performed contracted services for SEMARCA, and
owned a number of vessels and other assets in Venezuela. Tidewater had owned SEMARCA

and provided marine support services in the country since 1958.

In February 2009, Tidewater Marine incorporated Tidewater Investment SRL (‘Tidewater
Barbados’) in Barbados. On 9 March 2009, Tidewater Marine transferred to Tidewater
Barbados all of the shares in Tidewater Caribe. Accordingly, Tidewater Barbados was

inserted into the chain of ownership and became the owner, through Tidewater Caribe, of

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

SEMARCA. The current corporate ownership structure is depicted in the diagram annexed to

this Decision as Appendix A.*

In 2008-2009, world oil prices fell significantly. PDVSA struggled to meet its payment
obligations to SEMARCA, leading to contractual negotiations between the two companies,
the significance of which for present purposes will have to be considered in more detail later

in this decision.

On 7 May 2009, the Government of Venezuela enacted the Organic Law that Reserves to the
State the Assets and Services Related to Primary Activities of Hydrocarbons (‘Reserve Law’).”
The following day, the Ministry of Popular Power for Energy and Petroleum issued a
resolution that identified the Claimants, along with 38 other service providers, as subject to
the Reserve Law.° Venezuela thereupon seized the Claimants’ operations and assets in Lake
Maracaibo and the Gulf of Paria, together with 15 vessels owned by the Fourth to Eighth

Claimants.

The parties have not reached agreement on compensation for those seizures and on 16
February 2010, the Request for Arbitration was filed seeking reparation and other relief. The

Claimants invoke two grounds for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction:

(a) Article 22 of the Venezuelan Law on the Promotion and Protection of Investments
(‘Investment Law’), which the Claimants submit constitutes a standing consent to

ICSID arbitration;* and

(b) The bilateral investment treaty between Venezuela and Barbados (under the law of

which country Tidewater Barbados is constituted) (‘Barbados BIT’).°

The Claimants submit that they consented to ICSID jurisdiction in a letter to Venezuela on 11

December 2009.°

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

Venezuela disputes the Tribunal’s jurisdiction:

(a) It maintains that Article 22 does not constitute a standing consent to arbitrate all

investment disputes under ICSID; and

(b) It contends that Tidewater Barbados is a ‘corporation of convenience’ incorporated
for the sole purpose of gaining access to ICSID. Accordingly, it submits that

Tidewater’s invocation of the Barbados BIT is an abuse of that Treaty.

B. Procedural Background
1. Constitution of the Tribunal and First Session

On 31 August 2010, the ICSID Secretariat informed the parties that, pursuant to Arbitration
Rule 6, the Tribunal consisting of Professor Campbell McLachlan QC (President), Dr Andrés

Rigo Sureda and Professor Brigitte Stern was deemed to have been constituted on that date.

On 28 September 2010, Tidewater proposed the disqualification of Professor Stern. After
each of the parties and Professor Stern had offered comments on the Proposal, the other
two members of the Tribunal rendered a decision on 23 December 2010 dismissing the
Proposal. Accordingly, the suspension of the proceedings that had been in effect was lifted

pursuant to Arbitration Rule 9(6) on that date.

Following the distribution of a Provisional Agenda and the preparation of a Joint Statement
by the parties, the Tribunal’s First Session was held on 24 January 2011, at the seat of the
Centre in Washington, D.C. In the Minutes of that session, the Tribunal ordered that, in
accordance with Arbitration Rule 41 and pursuant to the parties’ agreement, Venezuela’s
objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction would be addressed by the Tribunal prior to the

pleadings on the merits.

Accordingly, the Tribunal set a calendar for the written and oral phases of the jurisdictional

phase of the arbitration.’
2. Procedural matters

On 24 January 2011, the Claimants and the Respondent respectively filed Requests for
Production of Documents with the Tribunal.® The Claimants sought documents concerning
the drafting and enactment of the Investment Law, and particularly Article 22.° The
Respondent sought documents relating to the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados and the
7 Minutes, Part |, [14.2].

transfer of shares to it,° and documents identifying the services underlying the accounts

receivable for which the Claimants sought compensation.”

On 29 March 2011, the President made Procedural Order No. 1 for and on behalf of the
Tribunal, addressing the outstanding requests and ordering the parties to search for, and if

possible, produce various documents or explain their reason(s) for objecting to production.”

In response, the Respondent confirmed that it had no documents responsive to the
Claimants’ request relating to the preparation of the Reserve Law. The Claimants produced
an itemised schedule of documents responsive to the Respondent’s request specifying in it
their claim to privilege.* The Respondent objected to the adequacy of the Claimants’
disclosure, but by Procedural Order No. 2 on 20 April 2011, the Tribunal declined to make
the further orders sought by the Respondent, finding the claim to privilege to be adequately

made out.™*

Concurrently with the filing of their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, on 29 July 2011, the
Claimants made a Request that the Tribunal invite two individuals alleged to have been
involved with the drafting of the Investment Law, Ambassador Werner Corrales Leal and Mr
Gonzalo Capriles, to appear and testify at the oral phase of the proceedings.’* Following an
exchange of submissions, on 22 September 2011, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 3. It declined the Claimants’ request on the ground that, within the framework of the
ICSID Convention, the preparation and presentation of evidence is the responsibility of the

parties and not that of the Tribunal.”®
3. Written phase
Pursuant to the timetable set at the First Session, the following pleadings were exchanged:

(a) Venezuela filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 6 May 2011, together with Legal

Expert Opinion of Professor Enrique Urdaneta Fontiveros;

(b) The Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on 29 July 2011, together with Legal
Expert Opinion of Professor Carlos Ayala Corao and Direct Testimony of Kevin Carr,

(d) The Claimants filed their Rejoinder on 21 December 2011, together with

Supplemental Opinion of Professor Ayala and Supplemental Testimony of Mr Carr.
4. Oral phase

By agreement between the parties and the Tribunal, an oral hearing for the jurisdiction
phase was scheduled at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. for Wednesday 29
February and Thursday 1 March 2012. Neither party wished to avail itself of the opportunity
to call any witness or expert for oral testimony, nor did the Tribunal. Accordingly, the oral
hearing consisted of the submissions of counsel for both parties according to an agreed

timetable, together with the responses of counsel to questions from the Tribunal.

At the conclusion of the hearing, both parties confirmed that they had no continuing
objection to any aspect of the conduct of these proceedings since the constitution of the

av
I.

Tribunal.” The President then closed the evidentiary record and the oral procedure in the

jurisdictional phase of this arbitration.

The Tribunal has since deliberated in person in Washington on Friday 2 March 2012 and

subsequently by various means of communication.

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

M. THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

 

First ground of jurisdiction: Article 22 of the Investment Law
1. Introduction

21. The Claimants submit that Article 22 constitutes a standing consent to international

arbitration of investment disputes. Venezuela disagrees. The text of Article 22 reads:

Las controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pals de
origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado 0 acuerdo sobre promocién y
proteccién de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de las cuales sean
aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constitutivo del Organismo Multilateral
de Garantia de Inversiones (OMGI — MIGA) 0 del Convenio sobre Arreglo de
Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados
(CIADI), serdn sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los términos del respectivo
tratado 0 acuerdo, si asi éste lo establece, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de hacer
uso, cuando proceda, de las vias contenciosas contempladas en la legislacién

18
venezolana vigente.

22. Venezuela translates Article 22 as follows:

Disputes arising between an international investor whose country of origin has in
effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and protection of
investments, or disputes to which are applicable the provisions of the Convention
Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (OMGI-MIGA) or the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States (ICSID), shall be submitted to international arbitration
according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so provides,
without prejudice to the possibility of making use, when appropriate, of the
dispute resolution means provided for under the Venezuelan legislation in

effect.”
23. The Claimants’ translation is:

Controversies that may arise between an international investor, whose country of
origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and

protection of investments, or controversies in respect of which the provisions of

* ex, EU-01.
* Memorial [37] (emphasis removed).

25.

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between
States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) are applicable, shall be submitted to
international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or
agreement, if it so establishes, without prejudice to the possibility of using, as
appropriate, the contentious means contemplated by the Venezuelan legislation

je 20
in effect.

The parties exchanged extensive submissions on the interpretation of Article 22, which were
further elaborated in oral pleading. The points in dispute between the parties can be

divided into four issues:

(a) The standard to be applied to the interpretation of Article 22, including the

relevance of Venezuelan and international law to its interpretation;
(b) The correct interpretation of Article 22 produced by the application of that standard;

(c) The historical context of the enactment of the Investment Law as a guide to

interpretation; and

(d) The relevance of comparison with other instruments containing consent to
international arbitration, including other countries’ investment laws and BITs signed

by Venezuela.
The parties’ submissions on each of these issues are summarised in turn.
2. Standard of interpretation to be applied to Article 22
(a) Venezuela’s submissions

Venezuela submits that domestic Venezuelan principles of interpretation ‘play a useful

721

role’~ in the interpretation of a Venezuelan statute alleged to constitute a standing consent

123

to arbitration,” as an ‘appropriate starting point’~ in the interpretative process as evidence

of the state’s intention.** It submits that domestic principles require consent to be ‘clear’,

‘unequivocal’ and ‘express’.”* It cites a decision of the Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela which
applied this standard and which ruled that Article 22 was not a standing consent to

arbitration.”°

Nevertheless, the Respondent recognises that, ‘since the issue is whether Article 22 can
serve as a consent for purposes of the ICSID Convention, the principles of international law
also come into play.’”’ In this context, it refers to the principles of interpretation in Articles
31-32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’). But the Respondent places
particular reliance on the International Law Commission’s Guiding Principles applicable to
unilateral declarations of States capable of creating legal obligations 2006 (‘ILC Unilateral
Declaration Principles’),”* Principle 7 of which requires unilateral declarations within the
scope of the Principles to be ‘stated in clear and specific terms’ and ‘interpreted in a
restrictive manner’, concluding that ‘weight shall be given first and foremost to the text of
the declaration, together with the context and the circumstances in which it was

formulated.’”°

Venezuela accordingly endorses authorities that suggest that consent must be ‘clear, express

and unequivocal’,*° should not be presumed,”* should be construed ‘strictly’? and should be

733

‘expressed in a manner that leaves no doubts. It accordingly rejects the formulation

adopted by the SPP v Egypt tribunal to this extent. It contends that the principle of effet
utile cannot cure the absence of language of consent,*® and only requires that the Tribunal
reject a meaningless interpretation in favour of a meaningful interpretation, where the latter

is available.*°

In conclusion nevertheless, the Respondent submits that there is a ‘fairly consistent list of
factors’ that cuts across the various types of instruments of consent, namely, the text, the

context, the purposes and the circumstances of the instrument, which may properly be

applied to construe Article 22.°” Despite objecting to the application of the effet utile

principle, the Respondent accepts that the provision must be interpreted in good faith.*®
(b) Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that, in determining the question of whether Article 22 expresses
Venezuela’s consent to ICSID jurisdiction, one must start with the ICSID Convention, in order
to determine whether the statement is capable of validly stating the party’s consent to ICSID
jurisdiction, and then to general international law in order to ascertain whether the content
of the statement expresses such consent.®? Within international law, one should look
specifically to those principles governing the unilateral declarations of states ‘formulated
within the framework and on the basis of a treaty.”° The Claimants contend that such
declarations are in a different category to those dealt with in the ILC Unilateral Declaration
Principles.’ Relying upon the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice in relation
to the interpretation of states’ unilateral declarations of acceptance of the Court’s
jurisdiction, the Claimants contend that the declaration ‘must be interpreted as it stands
having regard to the words actually used’ and ‘in a natural and reasonable way, having due
regard to the intention of the state concerned.’” ‘That intention can be deduced from the
text, the context, the circumstances of its preparation, and the purposes intended to be

served.’

In consequence, the Claimants fully endorse the formulation adopted in SPP v Egypt, namely

that:

Ulurisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor
expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be
found to exist if — but only if - the force of the arguments militating in favor of it

is preponderant.*

They accordingly reject Venezuela’s contention that a restrictive approach to interpretation
ought to be adopted. They reject the statement to that effect in Brandes® and distinguish

the cases involving Most-Favoured Nation clauses.”®

The Claimants reject Venezuela’s reliance on municipal law principles. They are only relevant
to matters such as the legal existence of the statute,*” and to the extent that Venezuelan law
requires a restrictive interpretation of consent — which the Claimants submit it does not“® —
Venezuelan law must cede to international law.“” The Claimants argue that Decision No
1541 of the Venezuelan Supreme Tribunal of Justice was wrong and politically tainted and

accordingly ought to be given no weight.*>

According to the Claimants, this requires the application of the principle of effet utile, which
they allege the Mobil and Cemex tribunals failed to apply.” The ICJ’s consideration of the
intention of the drafting state in the Fisheries Jurisdiction Case (Spain v Canada) did not
exclude the principle.” Likewise the Court in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Co case recognised the
effet utile principle but decided that the words in question had been included ex abundanti
cautela,* and the principle was also recognised in the Case Concerning Right of Passage

Over Indian Territory.**
3. The correct textual interpretation of Article 22
(a) Venezuela’s submissions

Venezuela submits that Article 22 is a ‘compound provision which covers three types of

disputes: those arising under bilateral investment treaties, those arising under the MIGA

155

Convention and those arising under the ICSID Convention. It submits that the

requirement of consent ‘in writing’ in Article 25(1) of the Convention is not met. Irrespective
of the use of the imperative ‘shall’ in Article 22, this is subject to the condition ‘if it so

provides’. Thus, Article 22 ‘only recognizes international arbitration where the treaty or

agreement itself contains an obligatory submission to arbitration’ (as some BITs and the
MIGA Convention do).*° In other words, the proviso is only satisfied if all the requirements of
the treaty in question are satisfied, ‘including, in the case of the ICSID Convention, a

separate written consent.’*”

Because the condition is not met, there is no basis to go beyond the text of the statute in
determining Venezuela’s intention in enacting Article 22,°° and the Claimants seek to
construct consent to arbitration by reference to another document (the ICSID Convention)
which provides nothing more than a set of rules to be applied where consent otherwise
exists. Venezuela rejects the Claimants’ argument that the word ‘so’ in ‘if it so provides’
refers to an ‘infrastructure or framework of international arbitration’ and rejects the ‘logical
leap’ between interpreting ‘so’ to refer to submission to international arbitration and
concluding that ‘submission to international arbitration means to provide for the settlement

of disputes through international arbitration.’”©

To the extent that the principle of effet utile requires the Tribunal to adopt an interpretation
that gives meaning to the clause, Venezuela submits that the purpose of Article 22 is to
acknowledge existing international commitments and thus avoid any misrepresentation™, a
purpose which other articles in the same statute serve,” as well as to make it clear that
investors retain the right to resort to domestic Venezuelan jurisdiction (by the last
sentence). In this respect, Venezuela accepts that the first two limbs (referring to BITs and
the MIGA Convention) and the third limb (referring to the ICSID Convention) have different
purposes: the first two acknowledge existing standing consents, while the third
acknowledges Venezuela’s commitment to arbitration under the ICSID Convention only
where an independent instrument of consent (such as a concession contract) exists.
Venezuela nevertheless submits that Article 22 treats the three limbs alike, in the sense that

in each case the Article acknowledges the obligations contained in the treaty in question.

Finally, Venezuela submits that its interpretation is consistent with the surrounding Articles

18, 21 and 23.°°
(b) Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants focus on the ‘ICSID clause’ part of Article 22.°” It is accepted that the first part
of the clause (‘Controversies in respect of which the provisions of the [ICSID Convention] are
applicable’) refers to jurisdiction ratione personae and materiae which are met. The term
‘shall’ denotes a mandate (notwithstanding Venezuela’s ‘fallacious’ comparison with Article
23).° The word ‘it’/‘este’ refers to the noun ‘treaty or agreement’ — in this context the
Convention — so ‘asi...lo’ refers to ‘the action of the preceding verb’, i.e. submission to

arbitration.” Accordingly, the qualifier ‘if it so establishes’ means ‘if [the respective treaty

71

or agreement] establishes [submission to international arbitration]. The crux of the

Claimants’ interpretation is their argument that to ‘establish’ submission means to provide
for the settlement of disputes through international arbitration.” Venezuela’s
interpretation, according to the Claimants, requires reading the clause to mean ‘if the ICSID
Convention establishes consent’.”* That is untenable because (a) the term ‘consent’ appears
nowhere in the preceding clause” and (b) if ‘submission to international arbitration’ (the

phrase to which ‘if it so provides’ refers back) encompassed the notion of consent then none
of the listed treaties would qualify:”° the ICSID Convention cannot contain a state’s consent”
and neither the ICSID Convention nor any of the other treaties can contain both the state’s

and the investor’s consent, both of which are necessary.”

Venezuela’s interpretation deprives the Article of useful effect in violation of the principle of

effet utile.”® The ICSID Convention does not contain an obligation to arbitrate without a
separate instrument of consent, so there is no obligation in the ICISD Convention to recall.”?

In any case, to merely recall and confirm existing obligations is not a useful effect because

the principle of effet utile requires a legal effect. Finally, Venezuela’s approach amounts to
the imposition of a burden of proof inconsistent with a neutral approach to the
interpretation of such clauses.** The Claimants suggest that ‘rational legislators’ are
presumed not to have intended a self-defeating result,®’ and that the presumption of good
faith ‘precludes an interpretation that makes the legal provision useless while giving to the
addressees of the provision the illusion that it confers a right or benefit to them.’

The final sentence providing for Venezuelan jurisdiction ‘confirms that Article 22 was

intended to have useful effects.’**

It cannot have been intended to disclaim instruments
other than Article 22 because that would be illogical and ineffective (in the case of

international treaties which cannot be disclaimed by a domestic statute).
4. The historical context of the enactment of the Investment Law
(a) Venezuela’s submissions

Venezuela submits that the Claimants’ interpretation is ‘irreconcilable with the historical
background of the statute and prevailing attitudes in Venezuela towards international

’8° It cites the fact that

arbitration in general and arbitration by the State in particular.’
President Chavez, who also promulgated the Investment Law, proposed that there be no
provision in the Constitution for arbitration in the case of public interest contracts,®” and
cites an Instruction and a Decree issued by President Chavez limiting arbitration of disputes
involving public interest contracts." It rejects the Claimants’ argument that, because
Venezuela took ‘pro-arbitration’ steps around the time the Investment Law was
promulgated, Article 22 must express consent.” It also rejects the Claimants’ reliance on
Article 258 of the Constitution which, it says, merely promotes a range of dispute resolution
mechanisms and does not mandate arbitration, let alone international arbitration.”

Venezuela maintains that Article 151 of the Constitution, despite the fact that President

Chavez’s initiative was not taken up, along with other factors, demonstrates a continuing

hostile attitude to international arbitration.”

Venezuela refers to the mandate to negotiate further BITs in Article 5 of the Investment Law,
says that an interpretation of Article 22 as a standing consent is inconsistent with
Venezuela’s policy of negotiating reciprocal investment protection,” and suggests that if
Article 22 was intended to have that effect it would have been promoted as such to
international investors at the time, as was the case in SPP v Egypt.”? Accordingly, there is no
basis on which to suggest that Venezuela set out to ‘deceive’ investors into thinking the

state had unilaterally consented to arbitration.”

Venezuela submits that Mr Corrales’ statements on the drafting and meaning of the
Investment Law provided no basis on which to conclude that Article 22 was a standing
consent to arbitration.” It argues that Mr Corrales’ stated ‘opinions’ have been constructed
ex post facto to serve the benefit of investors such as the Claimants,”* and that those views
cannot be equated with the intention of the legislators” and were not necessarily adopted

by the legislators.°® It also points to the contrary views of other commentators.”
(b) Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants point to a number of developments around the time of the Investment Law
that demonstrate a shift in Venezuela’s attitudes towards the encouragement of foreign

investment and the protection of investors, including through access to arbitration.“ They

1.

also rely on the support for arbitration given in Article 258 of the Constitution.” They

submit that the interpretation of Article 22 advanced by Venezuela suggests that Venezuela

encouraged the ‘illusion’ that it consented to ICSID jurisdiction, ‘an exercise in deception

[which] is the antithesis of good faith.”

The Claimants rely on statements of Mr Corrales that the drafters (he and Mr Capriles)
envisaged Article 22 as a standing consent to arbitration,“ and that this intention was
‘discussed and endorsed’ at two meetings of the Economic Cabinet and one of the Cabinet in
full. The Claimants say that Mr Corrales’ statements are relevant because Venezuela has
presented no other contemporaneous evidence or travaux préparatoires*® and that those
opinions are therefore the ‘sole available evidence.’ The Claimants suggest that Mobil and

Cemex rejected this evidence only because his statements took place after those

proceedings had begun and because the Claimants apparently did not ask him to testify.”

5. The relevance of other instruments as sources of comparison

(a) Venezuela’s submissions

108

Venezuela contrasts Article 22 with a number of model arbitration clauses,” other domestic

9 110

investment laws,’ and Venezuelan BITs”° that all contain consent to arbitration to

demonstrate that Article 22 does not contain such consent. Venezuela submits that while
there is no ‘magical language for expressing consent’,"* these comparators do show that, if
Venezuela had intended Article 22 to have that effect, it would have chosen one of the

common formulations with which Venezuela was already familiar,” not the ‘confusing and

13
2.

ambiguous wording of Article 2 Moreover, if Article 22 was intended to constitute

consent, then the drafters would have defined the scope of that consent.’*

(b) Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants reject Venezuela’s reliance on the 1968 Model Clauses because the relevant
words have been deleted from the latest version and because a model clause provides no
guide to the interpretation of Article 22.° They also reject Venezuela’s other comparisons

because the ‘comparators have completely different structures from that of Article 22’ and

do not tell us anything about the meaning of Article 22.%° The argument that Venezuela
knew how to draft a consent clause by 1999 is misplaced because it ignores the fact that
consent may be drafted in any number of ways, and presupposes correspondence between

domestic statutes and BITs.'””

B. — Second ground of jurisdiction: the Barbados BIT
1. Introduction

The second ground of jurisdiction invoked by the Claimants is based on the Barbados BIT. If
the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction pursuant to Article 22 of the Investment Law,
then it will have jurisdiction over the entire dispute submitted by the Claimants in their
Request for Arbitration irrespective of the effect of the Barbados BIT. However, if the
Tribunal concludes that jurisdiction is only available under the Barbados BIT, that would
exclude from the Tribunal’s remit the losses suffered by the Tidewater subsidiaries, Point
Marine, L.L.C, Twenty Grand Marine Service L.L.C., Jackson Marine L.L.C. and Zapata Gulf
Marine Operators, L.L.C., including the vessels and assets seized from those companies
(except to the extent that these losses caused damage properly the subject of a claim by the
Treaty Claimants).’"* Nevertheless, the identification of the losses in respect of which the
Tribunal has jurisdiction is a matter that will fall to be considered at the merits phase of this
proceeding. The Tribunal does not express a view on this question at this stage but simply

notes it in order to put Venezuela’s jurisdictional objections in context.

Venezuela accepts that Article 25 is prima facie satisfied by the Claimants’ invocation of the
Barbados BIT, but alleges that in doing so the Claimants are committing ‘treaty abuse’ and
should thus not be permitted to invoke the BIT. Venezuela says that the Tidewater group
was restructured to insert Tidewater Barbados into the chain of ownership for the sole
purpose of establishing ICSID jurisdiction in respect of a dispute that already existed at the
time of the restructuring, or in preparation for anticipated litigation. The parties’

submissions are now summarised.

2. The concept of treaty abuse

(a) Venezuela’s submissions

"It relies on six

Venezuela relies on the concept of ‘abuse of right’ in international law.
ICSID awards to extract a number of factors that may be taken into account to determine
whether jurisdiction will be denied on this ground. Venezuela summarises the relevance of

these decisions as follows:

(i) Banro American Resources v Democratic Republic of the Congo: Canada is not a
party to the Convention but the United States is. After the Congo repealed decrees
approving the concession held by a subsidiary of Banro (a Canadian company), Banro
transferred its shares in the subsidiary to a United States affiliate. The tribunal
refused jurisdiction despite the fact that the requirements of Article 25 were

technically met.’”°

(ii) Autopista v Venezuela: The tribunal relied on the following key factors in upholding
jurisdiction: (i) the transferee entity had been incorporated 8 years earlier; (ii) the
transferee was not just a shell corporation but had actual business operations; (iii)
the claimant had requested and obtained the state’s approval; and (iv) the claimant

had a reasonable business justification for the transfer.”

(iii) Tokios Tokelés v Ukraine: |CSID jurisdiction can be denied in circumstances where an
investor creates a shell company for the sole purpose of gaining access to arbitration

under a BIT.”

(iv) Aguas del Tunari v Bolivia: Although acknowledging that the corporate form could
be abused, the majority found that such was not the case because (i) the entity was
not simply a corporate shell set up to obtain jurisdiction; (ii) the joint venture was
structured so that neither party had exclusive control; (iii) the entity had a portfolio
of 8 contracts and real operations; and (iv) the restructuring was planned and

executed before the events giving rise to the dispute.*

(v) Phoenix Action v Czech Republic: The restructuring in question was a ‘mere

redistribution of assets’ within the same family for the purpose of gaining access to

jurisdiction to which the original investor was not entitled.’** The Tribunal drew a
distinction between structuring an investment at the outset for the purpose of
benefiting from the protection of a treaty, and restructuring after the fact in order to
gain protection.”° Venezuela cites along the same lines Zachary Douglas’ argument
that if ‘the objective purpose of the restructuring was to facilitate access to an
investment treaty tribunal with respect to a claim that was within the reasonable

contemplation of the investor’ then the claim would be inadmissible.*”°

(vi) Mobil v Venezuela: Whether a restructuring constituted ‘legitimate corporate
planning’ or an ‘abuse of right’ depended on the circumstances, ”” and restructuring
for the purpose of gaining jurisdiction in respect of ‘pre-existing disputes’ is

abusive.’

As to the moment when the dispute arose — which is an important point in time for deciding
whether or not there is an abuse of right — Venezuela adopts the test propounded by the

International Court of Justice in Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions that a dispute is ‘a

1129

disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests’ and there

must arise ‘a situation in which the two sides hold clearly opposite views concerning the
question of the performance or the non-performance of certain treaty obligations.’“° The
Headquarters Agreement Case shows that the existence of a dispute ‘in no way requires that

any contested decision must already have been carried into effect’ where ‘opposing

131

attitudes’ are present. According to Case Concerning Right of Passage over Indian

Territory, the tribunal must look to the ‘source of the dispute’ — the facts which are its ‘real
cause’.’* In reliance on Lucchetti, Vieira and ATA, Venezuela submits that where ‘two’
disputes share the same subject-matter and the same origin or cause they are the same

dispute.***

Venezuela therefore submits that treaty abuse is committed when an investment is

transferred to a shell company in order to obtain jurisdiction in respect of an existing

dispute, or in anticipation of a dispute that is foreseeable, especially where an ‘intra-
corporate rearrangement’ was for the purpose of gaining access to ICSID rather than a

‘good-faith investment.’***

Venezuela extracts the following factors from the cases cited which, in its submission, show
that the dispute over which the Tribunal is asked to take jurisdiction was foreseeable at the
time of Tidewater’s restructuring, that the restructuring was done in anticipation of that
dispute, and the Claimants thus seek to abuse the BIT: (i) the timing of the restructuring; (ii)
the fact that Tidewater Investment is a shell company with little or no economic operations;
(iii) the lack of a reasonable business explanation for the restructuring, which means that it
did not create a ‘good faith investment’; and (iv) the fact that the host state’s consent was

not obtained."
(b) Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that there is nothing objectionable in an investor considering the

136

protection provided by investment treaties in structuring its investments,” and there is no

basis on which to impose additional nationality requirements ‘extraneous to the Treaty.’*”
The Claimants do not accept the principle on which Venezuela relies that restructuring to

obtain protection in respect of an anticipated dispute constitutes treaty abuse.***

They take issue with Venezuela’s reliance on the cases cited and the series of factors
Venezuela extracts from them, noting: in Banro, the dispute arose before the

restructuring; **” in Autopista, the tribunal was concerned with ‘fictional control’;*° in Tokios
Tokelés, the tribunal rejected the imposition of additional nationality requirements; in
Aguas del Tunari, the tribunal rejected Bolivia’s argument that the restructuring was a
fraudulent device and accepted that it was legitimate for an investor to take into account

the existence of a BIT in choosing a jurisdiction in which to establish; in Phoenix Action,

the tribunal only held that restructuring cannot be done ‘after damages have occurred’; *“?

and in Mobil, the tribunal accepted that restructuring to obtain protection for future

disputes is legitimate. *“*

The Claimants accept that the Tribunal must examine whether the international law
principle of good faith has been violated, and identify three factors that in Phoenix Action
were held to demonstrate that the principle had been violated: the timing of the investment,

the substance of the transaction and the intended economic activity.“

On the question of whether the dispute between the parties predated the restructuring, the

Claimants adopt the Mavrommatis definition of ‘dispute’ also presented by Venezuela, “°

but stress that ‘a dispute cannot arise until all its constituent elements have come into

1147

existence’ and that ‘[i]Jt must be shown that the claim of one party is positively opposed

by the other.’ They say that the Lucchetti, ATA and Vieira cases are distinguishable on the

facts and thus irrelevant to the Tribunal’s analysis.”
3. Application to the facts of this case
(a) Venezuela’s submissions

Venezuela submits that an application of the factors it has identified leads to the conclusion
that the Claimants’ conduct is an abuse of the Barbados BIT. Venezuela defines the ‘dispute’

in question as ‘a dispute over the need to ensure the continuity of service provided by

7150

SEMARCA despite the ... accounts receivable. A subsidiary aspect of the dispute

concerned the position of employees of SEMARCA, whom SEMARCA stopped paying in late

2008 and whom PDVSA began to pay directly."*

Venezuela relies on the following facts to establish that a dispute was already in existence or

at least reasonably anticipated when the restructuring occurred:

(i) The continuity of SEMARCA’s operations was required by the 2001 Hydrocarbons

Law:

(ii) In late 2008 and early 2009 PDVSA had fallen behind on its accounts payable;**?

at ‘breaking point’;***

(vii) According to the Minister of Energy and Petroleum the suppliers were threatening to
abandon Venezuela with their equipment;**? and the Reserve Law was enacted to

guarantee continuity of service.‘

Venezuela identifies a ‘conflict of interest’ existing prior to 9 March 2009 (when the
restructuring was completed) between the Claimants’ interest in receiving payment, even

where this resulted in interrupted service, and Venezuela’s interest in ensuring continuity of

2

service.“®* It thus submits that, when the restructuring was effected, a dispute already

existed because the Reserve Law was a continuation of the dispute that had arisen earlier

about the payment of invoices and the continuation of services*” and the position of

SEMARCA’s workers.*® In reliance on Lucchetti and ATA, Venezuela submits that the ‘two’
disputes share the same subject-matter and the same origin or cause and are thus the same

dispute.**

Even if that were not so, Venezuela argues that the restructuring was completed in

preparation for anticipated arbitration proceedings,*®

and that it was the prospect of
government action that prompted the Claimants to restructure their investment to gain

treaty protection that they had been content to live without for the previous 50 years.**°

Venezuela relies on the chain of privileged communications relating to the restructuring
which the Claimants have refused to disclose on grounds of privilege, and infers from the

167
b,

fact that the chain was begun by Mr Jaco! and that advice was (first) sought from

Venezuelan lawyers with experience in arbitration and compensation for expropriation

rather than tax lawyers,"

that the restructuring must have been done to prepare for a
dispute with Venezuela.*® It also relies on the fact that no document was produced that

demonstrated a business reason for the restructuring.*”°

Venezuela thus submits that no legitimate business reason for the restructuring other than
to obtain protection against a foreseeable risk of nationalisation or ‘government action’ was
identified.’”* Venezuela submits that the tax reason for the creation of Tidewater Barbados
is not credible because the timing was coincidental (coming five years after the enactment of
the United States statute that is said to have prompted the desire for a tax restructuring)
and decades after the original corporate structure was established; and because the
alleged tax advantage only required one foreign company to be interposed between
Tidewater Inc. and SEMARCA — and Tidewater Marine (a Cayman Islands company) already

served that purpose.’”?

Venezuela accordingly disputes the Claimants’ argument that their continued investment in
Venezuela was inconsistent with the expectation of expropriation and litigation, and
suggests that the cash advances relied on by the Claimants were nothing more than

‘transfers that were strictly necessary to maintain minimal operations’ and not true

174 and that the other alleged investments were either plans*”® or concerned

176

investments,

unrelated projects.

Venezuela argues that Tidewater Barbados is a corporation of convenience with minimal
alleged investments and operations and ‘does not perform any real economic activity in
Barbados [...].’"””_ It thus does not fulfil the object and purpose of the BIT, which is to

promote the economic development of the contracting parties. ”*

Although Venezuela accepts that (unlike in Aguas de/ Tunari and Autopista) the state’s
consent was not required for the restructuring in this case, it was relevant that the Claimants

did not request authorisation and hid the restructuring from the state.’”°

Venezuela thus submits that Tidewater’s restructuring was not done in good faith, pointing
to the fact that Tidewater Barbados was incorporated shortly before the claim was initiated,
that the restructuring was done for reasons clearly related to an eventual arbitration
proceeding, and that the Claimants created a legal fiction to gain access to international

arbitration to which they had no right of access.**°
(b) Claimants’ submissions

The Claimants submit that no dispute arose before Venezuela adopted the Reserve Law
because the Claimants were not on notice that expropriation would follow if the Claimants
refused to enter into a new contract with PDVSA™ and because a dispute cannot arise ‘until

all of its constituent elements have come into existence.’ Accordingly, they submit that

the ‘alleged “dispute”’ with PDVSA concerning new contracts (referred to in the 30 April

2009 communication from Mr Jacob) was not the same dispute as that which arose out of

the enactment of the Reserve Law.”**
The Claimants rely on the following facts in particular:

the 2001 Hydrocarbons Law.“ Accordingly, SEMARCA was not required by law to

(ii) | Between December 2008 and June 2009, PDVSA and PetroSucre paid over US$11m to

(iii) The Claimants’ restructuring was commenced in 2008, before the events which

Venezuela suggests made nationalisation foreseeable.*®”

(iv) The correspondence between SEMARCA and PDVSA in February 2009 showed that
SEMARCA sought payment for services rendered, and was reluctant to enter into a
new contract and keep sending money to Venezuela until payments were received,

and PDVSA promised that payments would be forthcoming.

(v) | SEMARCA did not threaten to suspend its services in February 2009 but in April 2009

certain issues.“

(vi) PDVSA paid a portion of the salaries of SEMARCA workers of its own accord and not

because it had to.’°°

(vii) PDVSA never requested that SEMARCA adjust its tariffs and SEMARCA had not

substantially increased them since 2006.***

(viii) The Claimants were never warned that the Government would expropriate any

supplier that suspended its services and none of the articles cited by Venezuela

substantiate this assertion,’ and in any case SEMARCA never interrupted its

operations until the day it was seized.***

PDVSA, which cannot be equated with the state. **

the Reserve Law itself to continuity of services, which undermines Venezuela’s
argument that it was enacted as part of a single ongoing dispute about continuity of

service."

The Claimants say that this is supported by the investments they made in Venezuela during
this time,*®” which show that they saw a long-term future for Tidewater in Venezuela, and
while they were reluctant to renew contracts while payments were in arrears, they saw the
problems their investment was facing as ‘short-term challenges’, given PDVSA’s ‘repeated
assurances it would pay the arrears.’*®° This is supported by the statement by Mr Dean
Taylor, CEO and Chairman of the Board of Tidewater, on 14 May 2009, that Tidewater did

not want to abandon the Venezuelan market unless absolutely necessary.”

The Claimants reject Venezuela’s attempt to infer from the non-disclosure of the privileged
communications, or the sequence of correspondents, that the purpose of the restructuring

was to obtain access to jurisdiction for this dispute.”

The Claimants submit that the restructuring undertaken by Tidewater was not done in
anticipation of litigation but (i) to achieve better protection for Tidewater’s investments in

202

Venezuela generally;”” (ii) to achieve a better tax structure; and (iii) because Tidewater

was already familiar with doing business in Barbados and it was economical to set up

2° and it was

business there.“ The restructuring was part of a ‘unified corporate strategy’
not effected immediately after the 2004 United States statute that made tax benefits
available because it was only in 2008 to 2009 that Tidewater Caribe’s dividends increased
sufficiently to justify the restructuring.”

The Claimants deny that Tidewater Barbados is a ‘paper company.’*””

tM. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

A. Introduction

The Tribunal will now analyse in turn each of the objections to jurisdiction advanced by the

Respondent in the order in which they were argued by the parties:

(a) Whether Article 22 of Venezuela’s Investment Law is effective to confer jurisdiction

in relation to the claims of all of the Claimants; and,

(b) Whether the Barbados BIT is effective to confer jurisdiction in relation to the claims
of the Second Claimant, Tidewater Barbados, and the Third Claimant, Tidewater

Caribe (together ‘the Treaty Claimants’).”“°

The Tribunal is empowered to determine these questions by virtue of Article 41(1) of the
ICSID Convention, which provides that ‘[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own

competence.”

B. _ First ground of jurisdiction: Article 22 of the Investment Law
1. Consent in writing under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention

The starting-point for any analysis of the question whether a tribunal constituted under the
ICSID Convention has jurisdiction to determine a dispute is the master provision in the

Convention itself, namely Article 25(1), which provides, in relevant part:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out
of an investment, between a Contracting State ... and a national of another
Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to

the Centre.”™*

Thus, as the framers of the Convention emphasised, ‘[c]onsent of the parties is the

cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.’**

The proper construction of Article 22 of the Investment Law has given rise to arguments of
considerable legal sophistication. It was indeed presciently observed in the leading
Commentary on the ICSID Convention that this Article ‘is drafted in ambiguous terms and is

likely to give rise to difficulties of interpretation, notably as to whether it contains an

1° Request for Arbitration, [30]; T1/188/12-14.

expression of Venezuela’s consent to ICSID arbitration or not.’*”? Nevertheless, at its heart,
the question before this Tribunal is simply whether Article 22, on its proper construction,
constitutes consent in writing on the part of Venezuela to submit this dispute to ICSID
arbitration. In other words, does this provision of a municipal statute operate so as to
produce the effect on the international plane prescribed by Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention?

From the outset of the Convention, it was envisaged that one method by which a state might
give its consent in writing is in municipal investment promotion legislation:**

Thus, a host State might in its investment promotion legislation offer to submit

disputes arising out of certain classes of investments to the jurisdiction of the

Centre, and the investor might give his consent by accepting the offer in writing.
The first example of a finding that municipal investment promotion legislation did constitute
consent in writing to ICSID arbitration is found in the Decision on Jurisdiction in the
‘Pyramids’ arbitration™® in which the tribunal interpreted Article 8 of the Egyptian
Investment Law. But it is axiomatic that each document alleged to constitute consent in
writing for the purpose of the Convention must be interpreted on its own terms in order to

determine whether it does in fact give rise to such consent.

The Tribunal notes that the question of whether Article 22 of the Venezuelan Investment
Law does constitute consent has been argued before three other ICSID arbitral tribunals,
whose decisions on the point have been cited to it in these proceedings.”“* Nevertheless, the
present Tribunal will determine the question afresh, in the light of the submissions, and the

expert evidence, placed before it. It proposes to do so by examining:

(a) The approach to be applied to the interpretation of Article 22 as an

instrument of consent; and then,

(b) The correct interpretation of Article 22 produced by that approach.

2. Legal principles applicable to the interpretation of Article 22
(a) Fundamental elements

Although the parties disagreed on several aspects of the approach which they respectively

contended ought to be adopted by the Tribunal to the interpretation of Article 22,

nevertheless, the Tribunal finds that there was a broad measure of agreement as to the

following fundamental elements:

(a) Both parties accepted that both international law and Venezuelan law have a role to
play (though they differed as to the nature of these respective roles);””

(b) Both parties accepted that the provision had to be interpreted in good faith;”"*

(c) Both parties accepted that, in arriving at the meaning of the provision, the
interpreter was entitled to have regard to a list of factors that were fairly consistent
across the various approaches, namely the natural and ordinary meaning of the text,
the context, the object and purpose of the provision and the surrounding

circumstances.”

The Tribunal agrees with each of these propositions. It will, however, elaborate on the
applicable principles, which require that two questions be answered: the first one is whether
national law has a priority role to play as argued by Venezuela, or whether essentially
international law applies to the interpretation of a national law like the Investment Law, as
argued by the Claimants; the second question is, if international principles of interpretation
are applicable, should one use the rules for the interpretation of treaties or rules for the

interpretation of unilateral acts?
(b) National law or international law?

Should the Tribunal apply national rules of interpretation or the international rules of
interpretation? It is the Tribunal’s view that the Investment Law being a municipal legal
instrument susceptible to having effects on the international plane, both national rules of

interpretation and international rules of interpretation have their role to play.

In addressing this question of consent under Article 25, a tribunal is not bound to apply only
host state law, even in a case where one of the parties’ consent derives from host state law.

This question has already been addressed by other ICSID tribunals.

Thus, in SPP v Egypt,?”°

the source of the state’s consent was a provision in its investment
law. Egypt submitted that the jurisdictional issues were governed by Egyptian law, and that,
pursuant to the Egyptian Civil Code, no effective arbitration agreement had been concluded.
This submission was rejected by a tribunal presided over by Jiménez de Aréchaga. It applied
instead general principles of interpretation and international law to the question of consent,

stating that:

Thus in deciding whether in the circumstances of the present case Law No. 43
constitutes consent to the Centre’s jurisdiction, the Tribunal will apply general
principles of statutory interpretation taking into consideration, where
appropriate, relevant rules of treaty interpretation and principles of international

. , 221
law applicable to unilateral declarations.

In CSOB v Slovakia, the tribunal’s jurisdiction was derived from a contract. The tribunal held

nevertheless that:

The question of whether the parties have effectively expressed their consent to
ICSID jurisdiction is not to be answered by reference to national law. It is
governed by international law as set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID

22
Convention.

However, in Zhinvali v Georgia, a case where the instrument of consent was a municipal

investment protection statute, the tribunal opined that:

.. if the national law of Georgia addresses this question of ‘consent’, which the
Tribunal finds that it does, then the Tribunal must follow that national law

guidance but always subject to ultimate governance by international law.””*

The Tribunal does not consider that national law has to be completely disregarded, but
considers that logic implies that an act, which is both rooted in the national legal order and
extends its effects in the international legal order, has to be interpreted by reference to both
legal orders. Thus, an ICSID tribunal determining its jurisdiction is not required to interpret
the instrument of consent according primarily to national law, but rather has to take into
account the principles of international law. The next question naturally is to determine

which principles of international law are applicable.

(c) Which principles of international law?

The Respondent presented arguments for a restrictive approach, by reference to the ILC
Unilateral Declaration Principles. Indeed, the Respondent seeks to argue, on various
grounds, that the Tribunal ought to take a more restrictive approach to interpretation of
Article 22 than might be the case with other instruments. In the first place, the Respondent
alleges that Article 22 ought to be treated as the unilateral declaration of a state to be
construed in accordance with the ILC Unilateral Declaration Principles, Principle 7 of which
requires declarations to be ‘interpreted in a restrictive manner.’ For the reasons set out

below, the Tribunal does not accept that it must do so.

To the extent that Article 22, as a provision in a municipal law statute, is alleged to produce
the prescribed effect of state consent under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, it may be
analysed as a unilateral declaration of a state. That is to say, it is a statement made
unilaterally by an organ of the state, namely the legislature, which may, according to its
proper construction, produce legal effects on the international plane vis-a-vis other states,
namely the Contracting States to the ICSID Convention and their nationals. The Working
Group of the International Law Commission, when engaged initially in defining the scope of
its work on unilateral declarations, accepted that internal acts (‘laws, decrees, regulations’)
need not be treated as unilateral acts, but ‘internal acts that may have effects on the
international plane ... should be included to the extent that such unilateral acts create legal

situations which are opposable in conformity with international law.”?*

In the Tribunal’s view, the critical distinction is not whether the source of the unilateral act is
found in municipal legislation, but rather whether the act is undertaken within, or outside,
the framework of a treaty, and in particular a treaty that provides for the possibility of
submission to the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal. Where the question is
one of the legal effects in international law to be attributed to the unilateral statements of a
state offered outside any treaty framework, one might well accept that a restrictive
approach should be adopted, so as to separate from the numerous statements made by
heads of state, heads of government and foreign ministers, that much smaller category of
such statements that were really intended to produce legally binding effects on the
international plane. The same point may equally be made in relation to municipal legislation.

The great majority of legislation enacted by states produces its effects solely on the

224

[1997] Ybk ILC Vol II(2), [205], Ex. CL-112.

31

90.

91.

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

municipal plane, and one must carefully distinguish the much smaller category of cases in

which the state intended its legislation to produce opposable effects in international law.

But these considerations do not apply where the action of the state, whether expressed in
legislation or in some other form of statement, is undertaken expressly by reference to an
international treaty to which the state is (or wishes to become) a party. In that situation, the
treaty itself provides the legal framework within which the effect of the statement is to be
determined, and so it is both unnecessary and inappropriate to add an additional standard
to that provided under the relevant treaty to the interpretation of the state’s act. It was for
this reason that the Working Group of the ILC left this category of acts that have a treaty

connection out of the scope of its work on unilateral declarations.””°

In other words, a national law which is intended to have some effects on the international
plane might be subject to the restrictive interpretation provided for in the ILC Unilateral
Declaration Principles, but this does not apply to a national law which is adopted in the
framework of an international treaty, even if such law is an exercise of the freedom of the
state to act on the international plane, as has been outlined by the ILC Working Group on

unilateral acts:

203. The Working Group bore in mind that, in the process of treaty formation,
amendment, execution, termination, and so on, States carry out acts which,
prima facie, are unilateral in character when viewed in isolation (for example,
accession, denunciation, reservation, withdrawal). The Working Group
nonetheless considered that the characteristics and effects of such acts are
governed by the law of treaties and do not need to be dealt with further in the

context of the new study proposed.

204, Similar arguments were presented in discussing the possible inclusion of
unilateral acts carried out by States in the context of international justice.
Mention was made in particular of the characterization of acceptance of the
optional clause in article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute of ICJ as a unilateral act.
The Working Group was inclined to leave this category of acts out of the study

taking the view that such acts have a treaty basis.

205. The same position was taken with regard to internal acts (laws, decrees,
regulations) that do not have any effect at the international plane. However,
internal acts that may have effects on the international plane, such as fixing the

extent of the various kinds of maritime jurisdiction (territorial sea, contiguous

zone, economic zone, baselines), should be included to the extent that such

unilateral acts create legal situations which are opposable in conformity with

. i 26
international law.

In the Tribunal’s view, different kinds of unilateral acts have to be distinguished, i.e. purely
unilateral acts, called in the work of the ILC unilateral acts stricto sensu, to which the Guiding
Principles apply; unilateral acts which are a cause or a consequence of a treaty — like acts
implicated in the formation or the execution of the treaty — to which apply the rules of
interpretation of the VCLT; and finally unilateral acts which are adopted freely but in the
framework of a treaty which recognizes this freedom of action, to which apply some specific

rules, whose content the Tribunal will now explain.

Clearly, the Investment Law is one of those unilateral acts, freely entered into by a state, but
taken in the framework of a treaty that leaves all its freedom to the state. In this sense, it
can be considered as being analogous to a unilateral declaration of a state accepting the
compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ, in the framework of Article 36 (2) of the Statute of the

Court.

The Tribunal is therefore minded to take inspiration from the analysis adopted by the ICJ for
the interpretation of a unilateral declaration of compulsory jurisdiction to the ICJ, which is
very similar to a unilateral offer to arbitrate, the difference being that in the first case the
offer to accept the jurisdiction of an international court is made to the other states and in
the second case the offer to accept the jurisdiction of an international arbitral tribunal is
made to the nationals of the other states, both being offers that will deploy their effect on

the international plane.

A first remark is that when a state decides to extend an offer to arbitrate to foreign investors
in a municipal law, it is free to do so and it can be considered as a unilateral act taken in the
exercise of the state’s sovereign powers. The ICJ analyzed in the same manner a unilateral
declaration of compulsory jurisdiction: ‘A declaration of acceptance of the compulsory
jurisdiction of the Court ... is a unilateral act of State sovereignty. At the same time, it

establishes ... the potential for a jurisdictional link with the other States ....’”"”

These unilateral acts are neither to be interpreted according to the rules of the VCLT, nor

according to the rules stated in the ILC Unilateral Declaration Principles; they have their own

rules of interpretation. In the Fisheries case, the ICJ clarified this point in the following

manner:

The régime relating to the interpretation of declarations made under Article 36 of
the Statute is not identical with that established for the interpretation of treaties
by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties .... The Court observes that the
provisions of that Convention may only apply analogously to the extent
compatible with the sui generis character of the unilateral acceptance of the

Court's jurisdiction.””*

These sui generis rules applicable to unilateral offers of jurisdiction imply that the
interpretation is performed:
in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State
concerned at the time when it accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.
The intention of a ... State may be deduced not only from the text of the relevant
clause, but also from the context in which the clause is to be read, and an
examination of evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the

purposes intended to be served.”””

One of the specificities of the sui generis rules applying to the interpretation of the kind of
unilateral act at stake here is that the unilateral act ‘should be interpreted in a manner

compatible with the effect sought by the ... State.’”2°

Another specificity is that it has not to be interpreted restrictively, since it takes place in the
conventional context of a treaty. Thus, declarations of a state that fall for assessment in
terms of whether they produce effects within the context of a treaty framework — and in
particular the effect of submission to the jurisdiction of an international tribunal — are not
subject to the restrictive approach to be taken for other kinds of unilateral declarations.
Such an approach does not limit a state’s freedom to act, since the state retains full power
to decide whether to enter into the treaty in question and whether to take advantage or not
of the possibilities offered by the treaty.

Thus, an ICSID tribunal determining its jurisdiction is required to consider directly whether

there is the requisite evidence of consent required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention,

having regard to the common will of the parties on which arbitration is grounded and the

general principle (widely applied in municipal law as well as in international law) of good

faith.
(d) The Tribunal’s conclusion on the approach to interpretation

The Tribunal therefore approaches the question of the interpretation of Article 22 without
adopting an a priori position which is either restrictive or expansive. As it was rightly put in

the Pyramids Decision 23

[Jurisdictional instruments are to be interpreted neither restrictively nor
expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be
found to exist if - but only if - the force of the arguments militating in favor of it
is preponderant.
Putting the point in the present Tribunal’s own words, it will proceed to find that it has
jurisdiction if, but only if, the existence of the consent in writing of both parties to its

jurisdiction is clear.

The Tribunal finds itself largely in agreement with the general step-by-step approach to
interpretation of instruments of consent proposed by the Claimants”” which it restates to

some extent in its own words as follows:

(1) The first step is to look at Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention itself in order to
determine whether the statement is capable of constituting a party’s consent to

ICSID jurisdiction.

(2) In order then to determine whether the content of the statement expresses such
consent one must look to general international law applicable to this type of
unilateral act, since the issue is to determine the effects of the statement for the

purposes of the ICSID Convention as a matter of international law.

(3) Such a statement has the character of a unilateral declaration. But it is a unilateral
declaration formulated within the context of a treaty. Accordingly, for the reasons

that the Tribunal has already explained, the ILC Principles are not applicable.

(4) Rather, a unilateral declaration alleged to constitute consent to the jurisdiction of an
international tribunal is to be interpreted in accordance with the approach set out
by the International Court of Justice when interpreting declarations of acceptance of
the Court’s jurisdiction.

(5) This means that the declaration must be interpreted in good faith ‘as it stands,
having regard to the words actually used’**?; ‘in a natural and reasonable way,
having due regard to the intention of the State concerned.’*™ That intention can be
deduced from the text, but also from the context, the circumstances of its

preparation and the purposes intended to be served.

(6) Municipal law is relevant to determine the existence and validity of the instrument
at issue and may help to ascertain the intention of the state. But the question
whether the statement constitutes consent for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention is, for the purpose of this Tribunal determining its own

competence under Article 41 of the Convention, a question of international law.
3. Concrete application to the interpretation of Article 22
(a) The limited application of Venezuelan legal interpretation

As just mentioned, domestic law has a role to play first in order to ascertain the existence
and validity of the national law, but also in order to help understanding the intention of the

state in adopting such law.

Venezuela argues that, as a matter of Venezuelan law, Article 22 does not constitute a
standing consent to ICSID arbitration and that this Tribunal ought to apply and give effect to
restrictive rules of Venezuelan law in this regard. The Tribunal has carefully considered the
submissions of the parties on the interpretation of Article 22 under Venezuelan law; the
Expert Opinions of Professor Urdaneta Fontiveros, filed on behalf of the Respondent and of
Professor Ayala Corea filed on behalf of Claimants; and in particular the Judgment of the
Supreme Tribunal of Venezuela on the interpretation of Article 22.” The parties’ experts
disagree on the proper interpretation of Article 22. Further Professor Ayala Corea takes issue
with the Judgment of the Supreme Tribunal on a number of grounds. Neither party nor the

Tribunal wished to cross-examine either of these experts.

This Tribunal does not find it necessary to its decision to decide the issues of interpretation
under Venezuelan law, nor, for that purpose to determine any conflict of evidence between
the experts. That is because the experts agree that the Venezuelan law principles of
statutory interpretation require determination of the meaning ‘that is evident from the
proper meaning of the words, according to their connection among themselves and the

intention of the Legislator,’”°

which is in full coherence with the international principles
applicable to the case. Where they disagree is as to the proper application of those

principles to the interpretation of Article 22 as a Venezuelan legislative instrument.

But the question with which this Tribunal is concerned is the interpretation of Article 22 in
order to determine whether it produces the effect specified under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention on the plane of international law. This question the Tribunal must answer for
itself, adopting the general principles of construction which have been outlined by the

Tribunal.

It also follows that this Tribunal is not bound by the decision of the Supreme Tribunal of
Venezuela. While this decision is entitled to respectful consideration, the present Tribunal is

bound by Article 41 of the ICSID Convention to be the judge of its own competence.
(b) Text

With these considerations in mind, the Tribunal returns to the text of Article 22 itself, which

it will be convenient to restate here:

Las controversias que surjan entre un inversionista internacional, cuyo pals de
origen tenga vigente con Venezuela un tratado 0 acuerdo sobre promocién y
proteccién de inversiones, o las controversias respecto de las cuales sean
aplicables las disposiciones del Convenio Constituvo del Organismo Multilateral
de Garantia de Inversiones (OMGI — MIGA) 0 del Convenio sobre Arreglo de
Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de Otros Estados
(CIADI), serdn sometidas al arbitraje internacional en los términos del respectivo
tratado 0 acuerdo, si asi éste lo establece, sin perjuicio de la posibilidad de hacer
uso, cuando proceda, de las vias contenciosas contempladas en la legislacién

venezolana vigente.

The parties each prepared English translations of Article 22. These differ slightly in the
nomenclature used. But the Tribunal is satisfied that its decision on the effect of Article 22
does not turn upon any difference in the English translations, nor was it contended by the
parties that the differences were material.”” In any event, the Tribunal has considered the

interpretation of Article 22 directly in the original and authoritative Spanish text as well as by

23 wrt 4 Venezuelan Civil Code Ex. EU-4 ; Ayala Opinion [15] ; Urdaneta Supp. Opinion [4].

?37 Claimants translate ‘si asf éste lo establece’ as ‘if it so establishes’ and Respondent prefers ‘if it so
provides.’ However, Respondent pleads that ‘[t]he word “establishes” could also be correct, but only
in the sense of if the treaty or agreement establishes that the type of dispute should be submitted to
arbitration, not in the sense of if the treaty or agreement establishes the fundamental rules and
framework of arbitration’ Reply [34] n 60. The Tribunal therefore approaches this point of dispute
between the parties as one of substantial meaning rather than semantic translation.

reference to the parties’ English translations.”*® For ease of reference, it now reproduces
below a consolidated translation derived from those prepared by each of the parties. Where

239

there is a difference in the translation, the Claimants’ text appears first” and then the

Respondent's alternative formulation.””° The Tribunal gives each translation equal weight:

Controversies [disputes] that may arise [arising] between an international investor, whose
country of origin has in effect with Venezuela a treaty or agreement on the promotion and
protection of investments, or controversies [disputes] in respect of which [to which are
applicable] the provisions of the Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency ([OMGI-] MIGA) or the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (ICSID) are applicable, shall be
submitted to international arbitration according to the terms of the respective treaty or
agreement, if it so establishes [provides], without prejudice to the possibility of using
[making use], as [when] appropriate, [of] the contentious [dispute resolution] means

contemplated by [provided for under] the Venezuelan legislation in effect.

The text contemplates three different types of treaty that may be applicable to the dispute.

Each of these cases is stated disjunctively and concerns respectively:

(1) First case: A treaty on the promotion and protection of investments in effect

between an international investor’s country of origin and Venezuela;

(2) Second case: The Convention establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee

Agency (MIGA);”"* or,
(3) Third case: The ICSID Convention.

One such category, the Second case (disputes under the MIGA Convention), is not concerned

with disputes with an investor at all, but rather with disputes concerning investment

242

guarantees entered into with the Agency itself.” The other two categories are concerned

with disputes involving international investors:

. In the First case, the express words of the Article refer to disputes that may arise

with ‘an international investor ...’;

38 The procedural languages of the arbitration are both English and Spanish: First Session, [7.1]. If

there had been a material difference between the Spanish original and the English translations of the
Investment Law, the Tribunal would have treated the Spanish text as authoritative in favour of either
of the English translations. The Tribunal is satisfied that there are no material differences.

In the Third case, the very name of the ICSID Convention (recited in the Article)

refers to ‘disputes between States and nationals of other States.’

112. To each of these three cases, Article 22 adds a condition and a proviso:

113.

114.

115.

(a)

(b)

The dispute may only be submitted to arbitration ‘according to the terms of the

respective treaty or agreement, if it so establishes/provides’; and,

Such submission is without prejudice to the possibility of using dispute settlement

mechanisms provided for under Venezuelan law ‘as/when appropriate.’

(c) Textual context

Article 22 appears as the second of three operative provisions within Chapter IV of the

Investment Law, which deals generally with ‘Dispute Resolution.’ The first of these

provisions, Article 21, deals with inter-state disputes in cases where there is no treaty in

force. It provides:

Any controversy that may arise between the State of Venezuela and an
international investor’s country of origin with which there is no treaty or
agreement on investments, concerning the interpretation and application of the
provisions herein, shall be solved by diplomatic means. Should an agreement not
be made within twelve (12) months following the date in which the controversy
began, the State of Venezuela shall propose the submission of the controversy to
an Arbitration Tribunal whose composition, appointment mechanism,
proceedings and regulations of fees shall be agreed upon with the other country.

The decisions of this Arbitration Tribunal shall be final and mandatory.

The two ensuing articles then deal with other investment disputes. Article 22 deals with

cases in which there is an applicable treaty. It is then followed by Article 23, which provides

for other disputes of investors generally under the Investment Law. As already noted, it

provides:

Any controversy that arises in relation with the application of this Decree-Law,
once the administrative remedies have been exhausted by the investor, may be
submitted to the Domestic Courts or to the Venezuelan Arbitration Tribunals, at

the investor’s discretion.

Pausing at this point in the analysis, it may be observed that the general structure and intent

of Article 22 may be discerned from its text, when viewed in the context of Chapter IV of the

Investment Law as a whole:

39

116.

117.

118.

119.

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

° Inter-state disputes are provided for by way of ad hoc arbitration to be settled by

compromis agreed with the other state under Public International Law (Article 21);

° Disputes under treaties are to be resolved by international arbitration if the treaty so

establishes or provides (Article 22);

. In the case of all other disputes under the Investment Law, investors have the choice

of Venezuelan courts or Venezuelan arbitral tribunals (Article 23).

The Investment Law carefully defines an ‘international investor’ — being the category of
investors referred to in Article 22 — by Article 3(4) as ‘[t]he owner of an international
investment or whoever effectively controls it.’ An international investment is, according to
Article 3(2) ‘[t]he investment that is the property of, or is effectively controlled by foreign

natural or legal persons.’

By contrast, Article 23 refers simply to ‘the investor.’ It is not by its terms limited to
international investors, but can apply to both international and Venezuelan investors. Article
1 states that the Law applies generally to investors ‘both domestic and foreign.’ Thus, the
avenues of dispute resolution afforded by Article 23, being court proceedings or arbitration
in Venezuela, apply equally to international and Venezuelan investors. Article 23 therefore
operates as a catch-all provision in respect of any disputes by any investor in relation to the
application of the Investment Law that are not otherwise provided for in Article 22. These
may, at the investor’s election, be submitted to adjudication or arbitration in Venezuela. This
is reinforced by the without prejudice proviso at the end of Article 22, which directs
attention, even in the case of international investors, to the possibility of applying

Venezuelan dispute resolution mechanisms as/when appropriate.
(d) Historical context

The Respondent advances arguments based upon the historical context against the
background of which it contends Article 22 was promulgated and which, according to it,
demonstrates that Article 22 could not have been intended to serve as standing consent. It
refers to Venezuela’s historical antipathy to international arbitration in general, and in

particular in cases where the state itself is a party.

The Tribunal accepts that the general historical and legal context, both under municipal law
and under international law, within which a legislative instrument alleged to constitute
consent was promulgated may well provide helpful evidence as to its interpretation. But in

the present case, it does not find the material advanced by the Respondent to be helpful.

40

121.

122.

The Tribunal does not have in the arbitration file any documents pertaining directly to the
legislative history of the Investment Law. Indeed, when requested to produce such material

8 When ordered

by the Claimants, the Respondent replied that it had no such documents.
by the Tribunal to undertake a fresh search, the Respondent confirmed on enquiry that it

had no such documents.”

The documents adduced by the Claimants prepared by Ambassador Corrales, Venezuela’s
Permanent Representative at the World Trade Organisation in Geneva, do not, in the
Tribunal’s view, advance matters materially. Although the Respondent accepts that Mr

5 the views of Mr

Corrales participated in discussions regarding the Investment Law,
Corrales cannot be imputed to the legislature. In any event, only one such document
predates the passing of the Investment Law. In it, Mr Corrales observes: ‘in our view, a
regime applicable to foreign investments must leave open the possibility to resort to
international arbitration, which today is accepted almost everywhere, by means of the
mechanism provided for in the [ICSID] Convention ....’™“° It can readily be accepted that
Article 22 does indeed leave open such a possibility. But this statement is ambiguous on the
issue that the Tribunal must decide, namely whether Article 22 constitutes an open offer by

the Venezuelan State to international investors to resort to ICSID arbitration.

The Respondent’s submissions on historical context do not relate directly to the framing of
the Investment Law. Rather, they concern earlier periods in the history of Venezuela or
other acts of the President of Venezuela taken in relation to other legislation. Both parties
accept, however, that the Investment Law was lawfully promulgated by President Chavez,
and indeed remains in force. The title of the law is ‘Decree with status and force of law for

the promotion and protection of investments.’ Article 1 provides:

This Decree-Law is intended to provide investments and investors, both domestic
and foreign, with a stable and foreseeable legal framework in which they may
operate in an environment of security, through the regulation of the State’s
action toward such investments and investors, with a view toward achieving the
increase, diversification and harmonious integration of investments in favor of

the domestic development objectives.”

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

To the extent that it is alleged that Venezuela maintained a policy against arbitration of
investment disputes at the relevant time, the Tribunal notes that, in addition to Article 22
itself, the Investment Law provides in Article 23 for a right on the part of any investor to
resort to Venezuelan arbitral tribunals for the resolution of disputes relating to the

application of the Investment Law.

Moreover, Venezuela had signed the ICSID Convention on 18 August 1993. The Venezuelan
Parliament had passed the necessary enabling legislation on 10 August 1994.*“* Venezuela
deposited its instrument of ratification on 2 May 1995. The Convention had entered into
force for Venezuela on 1 June 1995.™° As at 1999, Venezuela had entered into at least 15
bilateral investment treaties providing for international arbitration of investor-state
disputes,*®° including the Barbados BIT which was signed on 15 July 1994 and entered into
force on 31 October 1995. In the light of these international acts, the Tribunal is unable to
conclude that, as at 1999, Venezuela maintained a fixed policy hostile to the international
arbitration of investment disputes with the Republic which might shed relevant light on the

interpretation of Article 22.
(e) Submission if the respective treaty so establishes/provides

For present purposes, however, the critical question before the Tribunal is to establish the
meaning in the context of Article 22 of the condition applicable to all three of the treaty
cases contemplated therein that such dispute ‘shall be submitted to international arbitration

according to the terms of the respective treaty or agreement, if it so establishes/provides.’

In the Tribunal’s view, part of the apparent difficulty with this condition is the linguistic
tension between the use of the mandatory direction ‘shall be submitted to international
arbitration’ which is then immediately qualified by the phrase ‘if it so establishes/provides.’
Yet, in the context of the role that Article 22 plays within Chapter IV as a whole, this

structure of direction and qualification makes sense.

Compendiously, Article 22 is designed to ensure that provision is made for the option of
dispute resolution by way of international arbitration in cases in which Venezuela has
assumed a treaty obligation under international law so to provide. It follows, therefore, that

the provision for international arbitration contemplated by Article 22 must be one that

8 Ex, C-123.

* Venezuela denounced the Convention on 24 January 2012. The denunciation took effect on 25 July
2012. In accordance with Art 72 of the Convention, such notice does not affect the obligations of a
Contracting State arising out of consent to the jurisdiction of the Centre given by it before such notice
was received by the depositary.

accords with the terms of the relevant treaty, since Article 22 makes no provision for
international arbitration save to the extent that the relevant treaty makes such provision. In
other words, Article 22 refers to and respects the terms of Venezuela’s international

obligations to submit disputes to international arbitration, but does not do more.

In the First case, this qualification is necessary because the category of treaties
contemplated by the First case is heterogeneous and not uniform. Each investment treaty
contains its own unique terms, including as to investor-state dispute settlement. Indeed, the
examples adduced by the Claimants of Venezuelan bilateral investment treaties show
numerous different forms of dispute settlement provisions.” Nor is it necessary that an
investment treaty, which protects investments made by investors of one state in the other
state, makes provision for the resolution of disputes between investors and states by way of
international arbitration at all. Such a treaty may validly engage the responsibility of the
state to afford protection to foreign investors, but provide only for inter-state dispute
resolution; or it may provide only for resolution by municipal courts. Alternatively, it may
provide for investor-state arbitration, but only for a class of claims that is more limited
ratione materiae than the total corpus of substantive rights vouchsafed under the treaty. All

of these are solutions that may be found in contemporary investment treaty practice.

By adding the qualification presently under discussion, the Venezuelan legislator made it
plain in its framework legislation on investment protection that all of these options
remained open to the Venezuelan state. Thus, in the First case, the international investor
would only have the right to resort to international arbitration if and to the extent that the

relevant treaty provided for it and not otherwise.

In the Second case, the legislator denoted no more and no less than the standing mandatory
consent to arbitration of disputes between the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
and the member states expressly contained in the MIGA Convention itself, to which

Venezuela is a party.”

What, then, of the Third case, namely the reference to the ICSID Convention, on which the
Claimants rely in the present proceedings? In the Third case, the legislator is concerned with

one treaty only, namely the ICSID Convention, to which a majority of the world’s states are

party.’*? But the terms of the ICSID Convention provide that the submission of a dispute
under it to international arbitration is subject to the requirements of Article 25. As earlier
stated, a fundamental tenet of the ICSID Convention is that ‘no Contracting State shall by the
mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its
consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to

conciliation or arbitration.’***

Thus, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the subject-matter of the phrase ‘if it so
establishes/provides’ is ‘submitted to international arbitration’ with the consequence that
‘the condition means, quote: If the ICSID Convention establishes submission to international
arbitration.’**° But the Tribunal does not accept the gloss added to this by Claimants that the
reference to international arbitration denotes international arbitration as a means of dispute
settlement.”*° Rather, in the Tribunal’s view, all of Article 22 is concerned with cases where,
by operation of the relevant treaty, there is, for the purpose of the dispute itself, a consent
to submission to international arbitration. In the case of the ICSID Convention, that can only
be achieved if and to the extent that the requirements of Article 25, including consent of
both parties, are met. Otherwise, that fundamental requirement of the Convention would be
subverted, which would not accord with the express terms of Article 22 of the Investment

Law, which requires that the submission be ‘according to the terms of the respective treaty.’

In the Tribunal’s view, the argument that Article 22 itself supplies consent is circular, since
the condition stated in Article 22 expressly refers to the respective treaty — here the ICSID
Convention — for determination of whether it establishes or provides for a submission to
international arbitration. Article 22 itself adds nothing further as to this question, which

must be resolved according to the international treaty obligations assumed by Venezuela.
(f) Application of the principle of effectiveness

Now, Claimants argue that such an interpretation is contrary to the principle of effet utile
because it would serve to empty this Third case contemplated by Article 22 of any useful
effect. The Tribunal agrees that, in interpreting an instrument of consent for the purpose of

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, applying the principle of good faith, it should strive to

53 as at 1999, 130 states (including Venezuela) had deposited instruments of ratification. As at July

avoid an interpretation that either (i) leads to an impossibility or absurdity or (ii) empties the

provision of the legal effect intended by the state.

But the Tribunal does not regard an interpretation of the Third case in Article 22 which
requires the terms of the ICSID Convention itself to be met before a dispute may be
submitted to arbitration under the Convention to have either of these consequences. Of
course, as the Directors of the World Bank envisaged, a host state might in its investment
promotion legislation offer to submit investment disputes to the jurisdiction of the Centre.
But that is not the only means by which a state may give its consent in writing. As the
Convention’s framers pointed out: ‘[c]onsent may be given, for example, in a clause included
in an investment agreement, providing for the submission to the Centre of future disputes
arising out of that agreement, or in a compromis regarding a dispute which has already
arisen.’**” At the time that the Convention was developed, one of its most important
objectives was to ensure that ‘arbitration agreements voluntarily entered into would be
implemented.’ In such a case, the parties’ written consent is embodied in a contract, but
its effect on the plane of international law is to engage the operation of the ICSID
Convention as the procedural regime under which their dispute is to be resolved by binding
international arbitration. Consent in writing established in this way provides a sphere of
operation for a submission to arbitration under the Third case in Article 22 that is
independent of either of the other cases. Such a submission is established/provided for

under the ICSID Convention. It operates according to the terms of that Convention.

In addition to the instrument of consent, the Convention imposes other jurisdictional
constraints on the operation of the parties’ consent, such as the requirement that the
dispute arise ‘directly out of an investment’ together with the nationality requirements of
Article 25. Moreover, the manner in which the parties’ consent operates to submit the
dispute to international arbitration is prescribed in detail under the provisions of Chapter IV
of the Convention, which, as is well-known, provides terms that are very different from

those that apply to other forms of international arbitration.

If the Claimants’ construction of Article 22 were adopted, it would have the consequence
that all investment disputes with Venezuela involving nationals of any of the (currently) 147
states parties to the ICSID Convention would be, without more, subject to the jurisdiction of
the Centre. In the Tribunal’s view, such a construction would require clearer words in the

Investment Law indicating the intention of Venezuela to give such general standing consent.

Such words are not to be found in the text of Article 22. On the contrary, a good faith
interpretation of Article 22 in the light of the context of other elements of the Investment
Law applicable to the resolution of disputes involving international investors negates such an

intention.

If such a construction were adopted, it would create a significant overlap with the First case
in Article 22, greatly reducing the purpose of that clause. Most of the bilateral investment
treaties entered into by Venezuela with foreign states prior to 1999 themselves made
provision for investor-state arbitration of disputes under those treaties within the
framework of the ICSID Convention. If all disputes with investors of states parties to the
ICSID Convention were to be treated as submitted to ICSID jurisdiction under the Third case,
there would be much less purpose to be served by the First case, whose operation would be
confined to choices of non-ICSID international arbitration, where permitted under the
relevant bilateral treaty or, in rare cases, required because the other state is not a party to

the ICSID Convention.

The approach submitted by the Claimants would also have wide-ranging implications for the
jurisdiction ratione materiae of an ICSID arbitral tribunal and the applicable law. Article 22 is
not stated to be concerned solely with disputes under the Investment Law, but rather refers
generally to disputes arising under treaties. In the First case — a bilateral investment treaty —
the scope of claims and the applicable law will be determined by the terms of the treaty
itself. The same is true of the Second case — the MIGA Convention. In both of these cases,
‘the terms of the respective treaty’ will dictate the scope of the claims that may be

submitted to international arbitration. Those will be claims arising under international law.

In the Third case — the ICSID Convention — the treaty itself supplies no substantive causes of
action. Its choice of law clause, Article 42(1), refers to the ‘rules of law as may be agreed
between the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of
the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and
such rules of international law as may be applicable.’ The ICSID Convention, including Article
42(1), would operate naturally in the event that the Third case is construed so as to require
consent of the state by separate instrument. In the case of consent by arbitration
agreement, the contract itself would supply the scope of the cause of action, to be
determined according to its applicable law. In the case of consent to ICSID jurisdiction by
bilateral investment treaty, the treaty will supply the scope of the cause of action under
international law. In both of those situations, the ICSID tribunal would be acting, as

contemplated by Article 22, ‘according to the terms’ of the ICSID Convention. But if the Third

46

141.

142.

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

case were to be interpreted as supplying consent for all disputes with international investors
from states parties to the ICSID Convention, the scope of the causes of action submitted to

international arbitration would not be clearly defined.”*°
(g) The Tribunal’s conclusion on the first ground of jurisdiction

For all of the above reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Article 22 (Third case) does not
operate so as to give the consent in writing of Venezuela to submit all investment disputes
with nationals of other ICSID Contracting States to the jurisdiction of the Centre. Accordingly,
the Respondent’s first jurisdictional objection must succeed. The claims of all Claimants,
other than the Treaty Claimants, being based solely upon this first ground of jurisdiction, are
not within the competence of the Centre and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and must

therefore be dismissed.

C Second ground of jurisdiction: Barbados BIT
1. Legal character of this jurisdictional issue

The second basis upon which Claimants invoke the jurisdiction of the Centre, and thus of this
Tribunal, is by virtue of the provisions of Article 8 of the Barbados BIT. This provides, in

relevant part:

(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the
other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this
Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the
national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on March 18,

1965.

(3) The arbitral award shall be limited to determining whether there is a breach
by the Contracting Party concerned of its obligations under this Agreement,
whether such breach of obligations has caused damages to the national

concerned, and if such is the case, the amount of compensation.

5° art 22 may be contrasted with Art 23, which permits submission of disputes to Venezuelan courts

or arbitral tribunals and does contain a limitation ratione materiae to the resolution of ‘[alny
controversy that arises in relation with the application of this Decree-Law’.

47

143.

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the

submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph | of this Article to international

arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.
Claimants accept that their claim under the Barbados BIT is limited to the Treaty Claimants
(Tidewater Barbados and Tidewater Caribe). They further accept that the jurisdiction of the
Centre under this head is limited to Venezuela’s alleged violation of its obligations under the
Treaty. Since Article 8(1) requires that there be a dispute ‘between one Contracting Party
and a national or company of the other Contracting Party’, Claimants accept that they ‘could
not have expected to obtain protection for pre-existing disputes; they expected to obtain
prospective protection only against any actions in breach of the treaty the Respondent might

take after the restructuring.”

There is no jurisdictional dispute between the parties as to the validity or terms of the BIT.
Rather, the Respondent objects to this second basis for jurisdiction on the sole ground that,
according to it, Tidewater restructured its business by incorporating Tidewater Barbados and
placing Tidewater Caribe under its ownership in order to gain access to ICSID in respect of a
dispute that was already in existence or, alternatively, anticipated and foreseeable. This,
submits the Respondent, is an abuse of the Treaty, which may not validly supply the basis for

jurisdiction of the Centre, in such circumstances.

At the heart, therefore, of this issue is a question of fact as to the nature of the dispute
between the parties, and a question of timing as to when the dispute that is the subject of
the present proceedings arose or could reasonably have been foreseen. Venezuela alleges
that there was just one dispute between the parties that was already in existence well
before Tidewater Barbados was incorporated, and accordingly the present claim falls outside
the ambit of the protection of the Treaty. By contrast, the Claimants submit that the dispute
which pre-dates the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados was between SEMARCA and
PDVSA and solely concerned SEMARCA’s arrears and whether SEMARCA would renew its
contracts in light of those arrears. The Claimants say that the dispute arising out of the
enactment of the Reserve Law is a different dispute with a different party and was

unforeseen.

If the Claimants’ contentions are found to be correct as a matter of fact, then, in the view of
the Tribunal, no question of abuse of treaty can arise. On the other hand, if the
Respondent’s submissions on the course of events are correct, then there may be a real
78 14 /193/14-19.

48

149.

Tidewater Inc v Venezuela ICSID Case No ARB/10/5 Decision on Jurisdiction

question of abuse of treaty. The distinction was well summarised by the tribunal in Mobil v

Venezuela when it commented:

As stated by the Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their investments in
Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to protect those investments against
breaches of their rights by the Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID
arbitration through the BIT. The Tribunal considers that this was a perfectly
legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.

With respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different and the Tribunal
considers that to restructure investments only in order to gain jurisdiction under
a BIT for such disputes would constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix
Tribunal, “an abusive manipulation of the system of international investment

protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs.[”]?*"

Since ‘[u]nder general international law as well as under ICSID case law, abuse of right is to
be determined in each case, taking into account all the circumstances of the case’,*™ it is
necessary for the Tribunal to carefully analyse the events of 2008 and 2009 in order to
determine the nature of any disputes, the parties to them and when they arose or were

reasonably in contemplation.

The Tribunal does this in order to evaluate each of the possibilities addressed by the parties

in their submissions:

(1) Existing dispute: That the parties were already in a dispute concerning the same
subject-matter prior to the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados and the transfer to
it of the Venezuelan business on 9 March 2009, such that the dispute which is the
subject of the present proceedings had already arisen; or alternatively, even if that
were not the case,

(2) Foreseeable dispute: That the existence of the present dispute was within the
reasonable contemplation of Tidewater at that time.

For the purpose of considering the first possibility, the Tribunal proposes to adopt the test

set forth by the tribunal in Lucchetti v Peru that:

[T]he critical element in determining the existence of one or two separate disputes is

whether or not they concern the same subject matter. The Tribunal considers that, whether

the focus is on the ‘real causes’ of the dispute or on its ‘subject-matter’, it will in each

instance have to determine whether or not the facts or considerations that gave rise to the

earlier dispute continued to be central to the later dispute.”°?

In evaluating the second possibility, the Tribunal will consider whether ‘the objective
purpose of the restructuring was to facilitate access to an investment treaty tribunal with

respect to a claim that was within the reasonable contemplation of the investor’.”*

The parties cooperated to produce a core bundle of factual exhibits for the oral phase of the
proceedings and supplemented this with careful submissions, which have greatly assisted

the Tribunal. The following section describes the facts as the Tribunal finds them.
2. The Tribunal’s findings of fact
(a) Tidewater’s marine support business in Venezuela

Tidewater first established its operations on Lake Maracaibo in 1957, and as early as 1961
identified Venezuela’s ‘complex’ political environment as particularly challenging. It did,

however, operate in Venezuela from that date until 2009.”°°

As noted at the beginning of this Decision, the Claimants’ operations in Venezuela were
conducted through SEMARCA, a company incorporated in Venezuela. SEMARCA contracted
with PDVSA, PDVSA Petrdéleo and PetroSucre to provide marine support services in the Gulf
of Paria and Lake Maracaibo. SEMARCA had no general concession contract with PDVSA or
the other companies to which it provided services in Venezuela. Despite having been
established and done business there for half a century, such business was conducted on a
running account basis, with individual contracts entered into for each provision of services.
Thus, for example, in July 2008, SEMARCA entered into a six-month contract with PDVSA for

supply of marine services on Lake Maracaibo.”
(b) Contractual dispute between SEMARCA and PDVSA

Accounts receivable owed to SEMARCA began to accrue in USD in June 2008 and in Bolivars
in October 2008.7 Nevertheless, SEMARCA continued to execute new or renewed

contracts in respect of its operations in Venezuela through 2008. Its contract for services on

Lake Maracaibo was extended on 26 November 2008. *

On 17 December 2008, SEMARCA requested that Tidewater transfer to it funds which were
necessary to maintain its ongoing operations. Similar requests were made again on 5

February, 11 March, 20 March, 27 March, 3 April and 17 April 2009.7°°

On 16 January 2009, E/ Universal reported that PDVSA was struggling to pay its service
suppliers but quoted its Director of Finance, Eudomario Carruyo, as saying that the arrears

were ‘an important amount, but manageable.’”””

PDVSA Petréleo and PetroSucre continued to make payments to SEMARCA from late 2008
until mid-2009,?” but these did not eliminate the arrears owing during that period. In
summary, PDVSA paid approximately US$3 million in December 2008 and a further US$1
million on 6 March 2009. PetroSucre paid US$671,000 in December 2008, US$775,000 in
February 2009, US$1,262,000 in April 2009 and a further approximately US$3 million in June
2009.

On 27 January 2009, Ensco International shut down the Ensco 69 rig in the Gulf of Paria in
response to a lack of payment of arrears, which were said to have been under negotiation
since December 2008. PetroSucre’s employees then assumed operational control of the rig
under Ensco supervision, with PDVSA describing Ensco’s decision to shut down the rig as an
attempt to exert pressure and a breach of Ensco’s contract, which required that 30 days’
notice be given before a party could validly cancel for breach.”” PetroSucre’s actions were
described by Forbes on 30 January 2009 as the ‘natural progression’ of asset nationalisation

in Venezuela.” Subsequently, in May 2009, Ensco gave formal notice of PetroSucre’s breach

274 275

of contract,“"" and on 6 June 2009 terminated the contract.

On 28 January 2009, SEMARCA entered into a contract with Chevron for offshore maritime
services in support of drilling in the Cardon block in Venezuela.” On 23 March 2009, a

charter agreement was entered into with Chevron,”” and on 24 March 2009, the Claimants

278

sent two vessels into Venezuelan waters in fulfilment of this contract,“ which remained

there until June 2009.”” Similarly, on 12 February and 15 March 2009, SEMARCA submitted

a proposal for services to Repsol.”

On 31 January 2009, PDVSA began paying salaries and other benefits directly to SEMARCA’s
employees who had not been paid since 15 December 2008, and sought a credit note from

SEMARCA for the payments. “**

On 3 February 2009, PDVSA issued a press release assuring service suppliers that arrears
would be paid, but only if suppliers wrote off 40% of the outstanding balance. PDVSA also
urged service providers to ‘not engage in layoffs, or delay the payment of wages’™” as a
result of PDVSA’s delay in payments to suppliers.

On 9 February 2009, PDVSA rated SEMARCA’s performance in its 6-monthly performance

review as ‘excellent.’

In a series of emails in February 2009, SEMARCA made it clear that it would not agree to

renew its contracts unless the arrears were paid:

(a) On 17 February 2009, Mr Gerard Kehoe (Senior Vice President, Tidewater Inc.) had
written to Eulogio del Pino of PDVSA explaining that SEMARCA had been seeking

payment of its arrears since at least June 2008. Mr Kehoe said:

Unfortunately, Semarca is at its limit for the financial conditions
[necessary] to maintain continuous operations and the Tidewater Board of
Directors does not want to send additional money from abroad to support

. , : 28
operations while not receiving any payment for our invoices.

(b) On 18 February 2009, Ms Rosalyn Sierra (Administrator of Aquatic Operations
Contracts) forwarded a formal request from Mr Omar Vargas of PDVSA for an

extension of 92 days on Contract 4627.7
(c) The same day, Mr Jacob replied that SEMARCA was:

.. pleased that PDVSA wishes to extend the contract for the Boats.

Semarca exists to serve needs of PDVSA’s vessels, however we cannot
commit to any extension of the contract without arriving at an agreement

regarding the payments.

We are not asking for an increase in the fees, only that we receive
payment for the services that have been provided and that we continue to

provide.

After this month, we do not have enough capital to keep maintaining our

vessels in good conditions and in safe conditions for our crew.

We find ourselves in a point where, without additional funds, we will have
to place the vessels in the dock, one by one. We cannot in good
conscience assume a new contractual obligation that we cannot perform

with the quality we are used to providing to PDVSA.°

On 19 February 2009, Mr Jacob again emailed Ms Sierra. He said that he was ‘very

worried concerning situation with the boats’ contract’ and that with only four days

before the expiration of the contract it was still unclear whether PDVSA would

extend it.7°” On 19 February 2009, Mr Jacob elaborated on Mr Kehoe’s email. He

said:

Ex. R-47.
Ex. R-47.
Ex. C-25.

PDVSA owes Semarca an excessive amount of money, by our standards,
and nevertheless [we] continue providing services to PDVSA and have not

halted operations due to lack of payment.

We are reaching the point where we do not have enough capital to
continue maintaining our vessels in good and secure condition for our
crew. We cannot in conscience have a contractual obligation that we

cannot fulfill with the high quality that we have come to give PDVSA. ...

Unfortunately, in order to continue, we must receive payments.

All that we ask is that payment be made for services already provided, and
that continue to be provided, to PDVSA.

In the end, this situation of lack of payment is not sustainable and we are

close to our breaking point.”**

(e) On 24 February 2009, Mr del Pino replied to Mr Jacob’s 19 February email that ‘[t]his

week [PDVSA] will begin to regularize payments.’

(f) On 28 February 2009, Mr Jacob formally refused Mr Vargas’ request for an extension
of the contract. He explained that PDVSA had ‘changed the basis’ of the contract
when it had opted to pay crews directly, noted that the arrears remained unpaid,

and continued:

It is a fact that, without an immediate payment by PDVSA, we will not be
able to maintain our vessels fit for the work, however, in reality, out [of] a
sense of responsibility to the crew and to PDVSA, and with optimism that
the payment situation will be soon normalized, we will not turn off the
operations \yet [sic].

In view of the situation, instead of a direct 3 month extension, we propose
a 15 day extension, starting March 1%, to March 15", 2009.

At the end of this period, of course, we expect the situation regarding the
payments to be, at least, solved, and that this new form of administrating
the payrolls and benefits of the crew has ended.

. aan «290
It is only in this manner that we can accept a long term extension.

On 2 March 2009, Mr Kehoe and Mr Jacob communicated plans to send expatriate

Tidewater employees to Venezuela.”**
(c) Transfer of Venezuelan business to Tidewater Barbados

The Claimants began evaluating the structure of their investments in Venezuela in late
2008.”°? On 13 December 2008, Mr Mikael Jacob, SEMARCA’s Area Manager, sought legal
advice for the first time from Mr Ramon Azpurua (Venezuelan external counsel) regarding

the Claimants’ investments in Venezuela.”

The formal steps for the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados and its acquisition of the
shares of Tidewater Caribe were taken in Barbados and Venezuela from 25 February to 9

March 2009:

(a) On 25 February 2009, Tidewater Barbados filed with the Registrar of Companies in

Barbados its Articles of Organisation, as a company formed for the purpose of

(b) On 2 March 2009, it executed its General By-law No 1,”% as well as appointing Mr

Lundstrom as Company Secretary;*?

(c) On 4 March 2009, Tidewater Marine acquired all 300 shares in Tidewater Caribe
from Tidewater, Inc.*°° The same day, Tidewater Barbados in turn acquired those

300 shares from Tidewater Marine.*™*

(d) On 9 March 2009, that share acquisition was recorded in the share register of
Tidewater Caribe in Venezuela,*” which transfer was certified in the Venezuelan

Commercial Registry on 23 November 2009.77

Tidewater Barbados thus became the sole owner of Tidewater Caribe and the ultimate

owner of SEMARCA on 9 March 2009.
(d) Events of March-April 2009

On 6 March 2009 (and reported on 7 March 2009) the Minister of Energy and Petroleum and
President of PDVSA Rafael Ramirez stated that ‘the Executive will not permit the oil industry
to be paralyzed’ or ‘any one service supplier [to] paralyze industry activities.’ He went on to
say that PDVSA was in the process of ‘revising all [of its] cost and expense structures’ and
that although 94% of service suppliers would be paid in full, there were 56 large contractors
who would not be paid in full. Mr Ramirez noted that the amount of debt that PDVSA would

pay those contractors ‘depends on negotiations.’**

As noted above, in March and April 2009, Tidewater continued to send money to Venezuela
and pursue contracts with Repsol and Chevron. On 3 April 2009, SEMARCA finalised its

budget for investments (including dry-docking and major repairs) in Venezuela for the 2010

fiscal year at US $2,366,000.** On 16 April 2009, Ensco sent another rig, Ensco 68, into
Venezuelan waters under contract with Chevron. At the time, Ensco 69 was still under the

control of PetroSucre.*”°

On 6 April 2009, Mr Jacob wrote to PDVSA to say that SEMARCA would not continue to
provide services to PDVSA after the expiration of the two contracts due to expire on 31 May

2009 unless the arrears were reduced.**”

On 30 April 2009, Mr Jacob again wrote to PDVSA and said:

. We also have not received any payment of the invoices that remain
outstanding, which would have helped to mitigate the enormous difficulties that

our company has been facing to continue providing services to PDVSA.

Therefore, we sadly need to inform you that our situation has worsened, and it
has already reached its turning point. This is so because our parent company has
informed us that it may not continue funding local operations from abroad.
Therefore, we hereby inform you that our company will not extend the contracts
in_reference beyond May 31, 2009, date on which the last mutually agreed
extension expires. This decision may only be changed by the senior management
of our group of companies if we receive payments for the invoices that remain
outstanding and if all other legal formalities for a contract extension are executed

and fulfilled.

As we have stated on several occasions, our company wishes to continue

providing services to PDVSA, but, to do so, it must receive payments for the

services already provided, as per the contractually agreed terms.°™*

(e) Enactment of Reserve Law and expropriation: May 2009

On 4 May 2009, Venezuela commenced the legislative process for the enactment of the

309

Reserve Law. It was approved by the President and Cabinet” and transmitted to

Article 2. It shall be reserved to the State the assets and services related to the
performance of the primary activities contemplated in the Organic Law on
Hydrocarbons that were previously performed directly by Petrdleos de
Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and its subsidiaries, and that were outsourced to third
parties, being essential for the development of its activities. The assets and

services to which this article refers to are:

personnel, divers and maintenance; supply vessels with cranes for the transport
of materials, diesel, industrial water and other materials; tugs; deck barges; buoy
barges, sludge cranes, laying cranes for the placement or replacement of sub-
aquatic pipelines and cables; of maintenance of vessels in workshops, piers or

docks of any nature.

Article 4. As from the date of publication of the present Law, Petrdleos de
Venezuela, S.A. ([PDVSA) or the subsidiary that it designates shall take possession

of the assets and control of the operations referred to the reserved activities.

The following day, SEMARCA’s operations in Lake Maracaibo were expropriated,” and

employees subsequently passed from the payroll of SEMARCA to PDVSA.*"*

On 9 May 2009, E/ Universal reported Minister Ramirez as saying that the expropriations

were driven by the concern that the service companies might remove their vessels from

Venezuela. President Chavez, meanwhile, confirmed that the expropriations would save

$700 million per year and stated that ‘[w]e will bury capitalism in Venezuela.

On 14 May 2009, Mr Dean Taylor, CEO of Tidewater Inc., stated to the Seventh Louisiana

absolutely have to, unless we feel like we can’t work there in a safe fashion for our

On 4 June 2009, PetroSucre requested a three-month extension of a contract with SEMARCA

for services in the Gulf of Paria.*””

On 8 June 2009, an interview with Minister Ramirez was published. He stated that the
Reserve Law was enacted in response to contractors refusing to lower their rates by at least
40% to continue operating in the country. He explained that it was unacceptable to have ‘a
fundamental part of the process for oil production ... in the hands of a third party that said:
If you don’t pay me the amount | demand, | will leave with my motor boats and barges and
you figure out how you produce oil.’ Minister Ramirez denied that ‘PDVSA took over those
companies because of the debts’ owed. He said that ‘we are in a process of revision. Many
of those debts need revision both in terms of the rates as well as the contracts.’** The
following day, Minister Ramirez encouraged service suppliers to ‘stay in talks ... under the

certainty that we will always pay our debts.’*"°

On 30 June 2009, PDVSA wrote to SEMARCA requesting information in order to ‘prepare a
payment schedule’ for the outstanding debt.*” On the same day, SEMARCA offered to

extend its contract with PetroSucre on identical terms as before.”

On 3 July 2009, PetroSucre agreed to extend the contract for three months ‘under the same
terms and conditions as originally subscribed’ and promised to pay the outstanding invoices

‘depending on the available cash flow in PetrosSucre.’**

On 6 July 2009, SEMARCA made an offer to settle PDVSA’s debt. *”3

On 12 July 2009, the Claimants’ remaining assets and operations in Venezuela were
expropriated.**
3. Legal consequences of factual findings

The Tribunal now considers the consequences of these factual findings under three

(b) Respondent’s submission alleging a pre-existing dispute over the continuity of

service provided by SEMARCA to PDVSA;**° and,

(c) Respondent’s alternative submission that the present dispute was reasonably in

contemplation before the reorganisation in March 2009.
(a) Relevance of tax rationale

The Claimants developed the argument in their submissions, by reference to the witness
evidence of Mr Carr, which was subsequently supported by the expert report of Professor
Steines, that the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados and the transfer to it of Tidewater’s
Venezuelan business was driven by advantages under US tax law. The Tribunal finds it
unnecessary to make a finding as to whether the alleged tax advantages for Tidewater in fact
motivated or explained the incorporation of Tidewater Barbados or the reorganisation of its
Venezuelan business under the intermediate ownership of Tidewater Barbados. That is
because, as Mr Carr very fairly accepts in his statement, the restructuring was motivated
both by tax considerations and also by ‘risk-mitigation perspectives.’*° Mr Carr points out
that ‘Tidewater was aware of nationalizations by the Venezuelan government in 2007 and
2008. We wanted to ensure that we had a structure that would mitigate any such risk,
especially because Tidewater was planning to increase its exposure to Venezuela through
capital expenditures on its Venezuelan fleet.’*”’ This being so, it suffices for the Tribunal to
accept for present purposes that one of the two reasons for the reorganisation was a desire
to protect Tidewater from the risk of expropriation by incorporation of an investment

vehicle in a state having investment treaty arrangements with Venezuela.

As already observed, it is a perfectly legitimate goal, and no abuse of an investment
protection treaty regime, for an investor to seek to protect itself from the general risk of
future disputes with a host state in this way. But the same is not the case in relation to pre-
existing disputes between the specific investor and the state. Thus, the critical issue remains
one of fact: was there such a pre-existing dispute? In the present case, it is plain from the
chronology that there was a dispute between SEMARCA and PDVSA that pre-dates the
incorporation of Tidewater Barbados in March 2009 and the transfer to it of Tidewater’s
Venezuelan business. Thus, the real question for this Tribunal is a narrower one, namely: is
that dispute to be treated as part of the same dispute as the Claimants currently assert

against the Respondent in these proceedings? Alternatively, was the present dispute

reasonably to be anticipated by March 2009 when Tidewater Barbados acquired the

Venezuelan investment?
(b) Pre-existing dispute as to continuity of service

The Respondent alleges that there was a single ongoing dispute as to SEMARCA’s obligations
to provide continuity of service to PDVSA and that this dispute is inextricably linked to the
subsequent decision of the Respondent to assume control over SEMARCA’s operations in
Venezuela.

In order to advance this argument, the Respondent begins by alleging that SEMARCA was

subject to the obligations set out in the Decree Law of Hydrocarbons of 20017

including the
obligation in Article 19 to perform its activities in a continuous way. Claimants submit that
this Law had no application to their support services, since the essential obligation of the
2001 Law was to reserve certain primary oil activities to the state, but this was not done in
relation to services related to such activities, such as the provision of transport vessels of the

kind operated by SEMARCA until the Decree of 7 May 2009.

The Tribunal agrees. It finds that the Claimants were under no obligation as a matter of
Venezuelan law to afford continuity of service. It does so not simply as a matter of a formal
reading of the two pieces of legislation. The record of the parties’ dealings in 2008-9 set out
above demonstrates that both parties knew and accepted that they were doing business
simply on the basis of short-term contracts, each of which was negotiated between them on
an ordinary commercial basis. Thus, at the relevant time in relation to Lake Maracaibo, the
Claimants’ obligations to provide services and the Respondent’s corresponding obligation to
pay for them were set out in their contract dated 31 July 2008.*” This was subsequently the
subject of negotiations for an extension, at the request of the Lakes District Procurement
Division of PDVSA, in a meeting with SEMARCA on 26 November 2008, which records
detailed discussions as to the nature of the services to be provided and the accounts

between the two contracting parties.**°

Moreover, the Claimants at no time in fact withheld provision of their services. To be sure,
they did write to PDVSA on several occasions in early 2009 indicating that they would have
to do so, if SEMARCA did not receive payment on its outstanding invoices. The Tribunal
regards this as no more than ordinary commercial pressure by the party performing services
under a contract in order to encourage the counter-party to make the contractually-agreed

payments for those services under the contract. When on 30 April 2009, Mr Jacob of

SEMARCA wrote to PDVSA, he stated:

[O]ur company will not extend the contracts in reference beyond May 31, 2009,
date on which the last mutually agreed extension expires. This decision may only
be changed by the senior management of our group of companies if we receive
payments for the invoices that remain outstanding and if all other legal

formalities for a contract extension are executed and fulfilled.

As we have stated on several occasions, our company wishes to continue
providing services to PDVSA, but, to do so, it must receive payments for the

services already provided, as per the contractually agreed terms.°**

The Tribunal interprets this as a confirmation on the part of SEMARCA that the parties were

acting according to mutually agreed defined-term contractual obligations.

The Tribunal finds the Respondent’s conduct over the same period also to be consistent
with the limited contractual nature of the parties’ mutual obligations. Thus, both PDVSA and
PetroSucre continued to make partial payments to SEMARCA for its services from late 2008
until mid-2009. When on 31 January 2009, PDVSA made direct payment of wages to
SEMARCA workers on Lake Maracaibo, it sought a credit note from SEMARCA under the
contract for the sums paid.** PDVSA was certainly seeking to negotiate with SEMARCA a
reduction in the amounts outstanding. But at the same time, PDVSA was seeking extensions
to their contracts with SEMARCA,*”* and promising to regularise payments.*** As late as 4
June 2009, PetroSucre requested a three-month extension of a contract with SEMARCA for

services in the Gulf of Paria.*°

This being so, the Tribunal is unable to regard the dispute between SEMARCA and PDVSA as
anything other than an ordinary commercial dispute between a supplier of services and its
counterpart for recovery of sums due and owing for the services rendered. Both parties
recognised that SEMARCA had no obligation to continue to supply services beyond the end
of any contractually-agreed period, and SEMARCA’s position was that it would not renew its

contracts unless the arrears were settled.

Moreover, the stated position of the Respondent at the time was that the disputes with
suppliers over payments were not the reason for the enactment of the Reserve Law on 7
May 2009. Minister Ramirez is reported on 8 June 2009 as denying that ‘PDVSA took over
those companies because of the debts’ owed. He said that ‘we are in a process of revision.
Many of those debts need revision both in terms of the rates as well as the contracts.’*°°
The following day, Minister Ramirez encouraged service suppliers to ‘stay in talks ... under

the certainty that we will always pay our debts.’**” Under the Reserve Law, the assets of

some 39 service providers were seized.*** The measure was not simply limited to SEMARCA.

Therefore, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s submission that it should treat the
payment dispute between SEMARCA and PDVSA as part of the same dispute as the Treaty

Claimants’ claims against the Republic of Venezuela in the present arbitration.
(c) Foreseeability of expropriation dispute?

However, that still leaves open the alternative possibility that a dispute between the
Claimants and the Republic in relation to the expropriation of the Claimants’ assets in
Venezuela was reasonably foreseeable in March 2009 when Tidewater Barbados was

incorporated and the Claimants’ Venezuelan business transferred to it.

Claimants commenced their restructuring in December 2008. At least one of the reasons for
this is accepted to be a desire to protect themselves against the risk of nationalisation. But
was there a reasonable prospect, either then or in March 2009 when the restructuring was
consummated, that such a nationalisation was imminent? On the evidence before it, the
Tribunal does not so find. Tidewater had been in the business of supplying transportation
vessels to the oil industry in Venezuela for 50 years by early 2009 and had continued to
trade throughout many changes of government and government policies. Its actions in late
2008 and 2009 were consistent with such an approach. It continued to invest funds in its
Venezuelan business. It submitted bids for new business with other oil companies operating
in Venezuela, as well as negotiating for extensions to its contracts with PDVSA and

PetroSucre — the latter even after the expropriation of its Lake Maracaibo business.

At the same time, the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent’s actions gave rise to a
reasonably foreseeable expropriation of the Claimants’ business. Although an oil rig
belonging to an unrelated company was seized in January 2009, this post-dated the
Claimants’ decision to restructure their holdings. In any event, PDVSA’s actions vis-a-vis

SEMARCA at the same time were consistent with a continuing will to trade. Although
Minister Ramirez had stated in March 2009 that ‘the Executive will not permit the oil
industry to be paralyzed’ or ‘any one service supplier [to] paralyze industry activities’, he
went on to say that PDVSA was in the process of ‘revising all [of its] cost and expense
structures’ and that although 94% of service suppliers would be paid in full, there were 56
large contractors who would not be paid in full. Mr Ramirez noted that the amount of debt
that PDVSA would pay those contractors ‘depends on negotiations.’*” This is language

consistent with a negotiated contractual solution and not with expropriation.

The Reserve Law itself was introduced without warning and passed into law over just three
days from 4-7 May 2009, with the seizure of the Claimants’ assets taking effect the following

day.
(d) The Tribunal’s conclusion on the second ground of jurisdiction

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the acts of expropriation that give rise to the
present dispute were not reasonably foreseeable by the Claimants either in December 2008

when they began restructuring, or in March 2009 when the restructuring took effect.

In the result, therefore, the claims of Tidewater Barbados insofar as they relate to causes of
action that arose after its acquisition of the shares of Tidewater Caribe are subject to ICSID
jurisdiction, Venezuela having given its consent by virtue of Article 8 of the Barbados BIT,
and there having been no abuse of that Treaty by the Claimants of a kind that could render

inadmissible their invocation of such jurisdiction.
