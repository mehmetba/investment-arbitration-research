INTRODUCTION

A Request for Arbitration

On 16 February 2010, Tidewater Inc., Tidewater Investment SRL, Tidewater Caribe, C.A., Twenty
Grand Offshore, L.L.C., Point Marine, L.L.C., Twenty Grand Marine Service, L.L.C., Jackson Marine,
L.L.C. and Zapata Gulf Marine Operators, L.L.C. filed a Request for Arbitration under the ICSID

Convention against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (Venezuela or Respondent).

On 8 February 2013, the Tribunal delivered its Decision on Jurisdiction in which it held that it has
jurisdiction only in respect of the claims made by Tidewater Investment SRL (First Claimant) and
Tidewater Caribe, C.A. (Second Claimant) (together Tidewater or Claimants) pursuant to Article
8 of the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic
of Venezuela for the Promotion and Protection of Investments 1994 (Barbados BIT). In light of

that Decision, Claimants filed an Amended Request for Arbitration (Request) on 1 March 2013.

The dispute concerns the Claimants’ investment in marine support services to the oil industry in

Venezuela. The factual background to the dispute is summarised in Part | C below.

B Procedural history

The procedural history of this arbitration until the Decision on Jurisdiction is reviewed in that
Decision.
On 7 June 2003, the Tribunal adopted, with the Parties’ consent, a procedural schedule for the
remaining steps in the arbitration.
The Parties then exchanged the following pleadings on the merits:
a) On 29 July 2013, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits,
together with a witness statement of Mr. Gerald P. Kehoe (Vice President and
then Senior Vice President of Tidewater, Inc. during the relevant period) and

an expert report by Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek (of Navigant Consulting, Inc).

b

On 25 October 2013, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the
Merits, together with a witness Statement of Mr. Rubén Figuera (former
General Manager of Offshore Mixed Companies at Corporacién Venezolana

del Petrdleo, S.A. (CVP), a subsidiary of PDVSA), an expert report of Professor

Prof. Wells and the second expert report by Mr. Brailovsky and Dr. Flores.

On 8 November 2014, the Claimants advised the Tribunal of the Parties’ agreement not to make

requests for the production of documents to the Tribunal.

On 20 May 2014, following a request from the Tribunal, the Parties communicated the extent of
their agreement as to the organisation of the hearing on the merits, including the hearing

timetable and the order of witnesses.

On 21 May 2014, the Claimants sought leave to introduce into the record further exhibits C-250
to C-261. On 23 May 2014, the Respondent confirmed that it no longer objected to the admission

of those documents.

On the same day, the Tribunal resolved the outstanding issues for the organisation of the hearing

and communicated its decision on these issues to the Parties.
The hearing on the merits was held from 9 to 12 June 2014 at the seat of the Centre in

On 13 June 2014, the Tribunal conducted a preliminary deliberation in Washington, D.C. It has

subsequently deliberated by various means.

c Factual background

The Tidewater group was founded in 1956 to supply marine transportation services in the Gulf
of Mexico. It first established operations in Venezuela in 1958, by the acquisition of the
company now called Tidewater Marine Service, C.A. (SEMARCA), a company constituted under
the laws of Venezuela.” When the events that are the subject of this arbitration took place,

Tidewater had been operating continuously in Venezuela since 1958.

Prior to May 2009, the Second Claimant, Tidewater Caribe, C.A. (Tidewater Caribe), a company
incorporated in Venezuela, owned SEMARCA. Following a corporate reorganisation on 9 March
2009, Tidewater Caribe was in turn owned by the First Claimant, Tidewater Investment SRL, a
company incorporated in Barbados. Each of the claimant companies are part of the Tidewater

group of companies, ultimately owned by Tidewater, Inc, a United States company.

SEMARCA had its headquarters in the village of La Cafiada, on the western shores of Lake

Maracaibo. Tidewater Caribe owned the parcel of land used by SEMARCA for this purpose.?

The oil industry in Venezuela was nationalised in 1975. From that date onwards, Venezuela’s

national oil company Petrdleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) and its partially- or wholly-owned

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

subsidiaries engaged private companies to provide support to the oil industry in the country.
Those subsidiaries included three relevant to this case: Corporacién Venezolana del Petrdleo SA

(CVP), PDVSA Petroleo, S.A. (PDVSA Petrdleo) and PetroSucre, S.A. (PetroSucre).

SEMARCA provided its maritime support services under contract to both PDVSA Petrdleo and

PetroSucre.
SEMARCA’s operations were originally confined to Lake Maracaibo itself.

From the late 1990s, SEMARCA expanded its operations to offshore locations, including in the

Gulf of Paria off the northwest coast of Venezuela.

Despite having operated in Venezuela for many years, SEMARCA did not have a general
concession contract with PDVSA or its subsidiaries. Instead, it operated on a running account
basis by means of short-term charter agreements: frequent contracts with a duration of several
months that were periodically extended.‘ It is common ground that at the time of the seizure of
the Claimants’ assets, SEMARCA was providing services in both Lake Maracaibo and the Gulf of

Paria, under four short-term contracts:°

a) Lake Maracaibo: SEMARCA was providing maritime support services to PDVSA
Petrdleo under two time-charter agreements: (i) the so-called Tugs Contract

(Contract No. 8027); and (ii) the Supply Vessels Contract (Contract No. 4627).°

b

Offshore: (i) SEMARCA had chartered four vessels to PetroSucre to support
operations in the Corocoro Project in the western area of the Gulf of Paria (the
Corocoro Contract);’ and (ii) SEMARCA had a short-term agreement with
Chevron Cardon III, S.A. for two vessels to support its operations in the Cardon
Ill block of the Rafael Urdaneta Project north of Lake Maracaibo (the Cardén

Contract).®

The Parties dispute the duration and status of those contracts at the date of the Reserve Law, a

matter that the Tribunal addresses below.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

In 2008-2009, world oil prices fell significantly. PDVSA struggled to meet its payment obligations
to SEMARCA.°

As the Tribunal observed in the Decision on Jurisdiction, accounts receivable owed to SEMARCA
began to accrue in June 2008.1? By 31 May 2009, Tidewater’s Annual Report recorded that
SEMARCA had accounts receivable of approximately USD $40 million.*?

On 7 May 2009, the Government of Venezuela enacted the Organic Law that Reserves to the
State the Assets and Services Related to Primary Activities of Hydrocarbons (Reserve Law).’? The
following day, 8 May 2009, the Ministry of Popular Power for Energy and Petroleum issued a
resolution (Resolution No. 51) that identified the Claimants, along with 38 other service

providers, as subject to the Reserve Law.?

The same day SEMARCA’s assets on Lake Maracaibo were seized, including its headquarters at
La Cafiada and 11 vessels.’* SEMARCA continued to provide services to PetroSucre in the Gulf of
Paria following that seizure, but on 12 July 2009 the Claimants’ four vessels serving the Corocoro
Project in the Gulf of Paria were also seized.’° The Parties disagree on the scope of application
of the Reserve Law, the extent of the seizures, and the extent of the Claimants’ remaining assets

and operations in Venezuela. The Tribunal returns to those issues in Part Ill of this Award.

° Counter-Memorial, [11].

2 See Decision on Jurisdiction, [154]-[181]. As noted below, the factual findings that were made by the
Tribunal for the purpose of determining whether the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction were made
out are not binding on the Tribunal when it comes to the determination of the Claimants’ claims on the
merits. Nevertheless, and subject to what follows in this Award, that summary describes the events leading
up to the seizures that have given rise to the present arbitration.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS

In this section of the Award, the Tribunal summarises the Parties’ respective submissions on the
two issues which it is the Tribunal’s task to resolve: first, the scope of Respondent's liability; and
second, the proper quantum of compensation due to Claimants in the light of the Tribunal’s

findings as to liability.

The Tribunal observes at the outset that Respondent accepts that the Reserve Law and the
Government’s associated administrative acts had the effect of expropriating property of value
belonging to Claimants.*® Respondent also accepts that the Respondent is obliged to pay to
Claimants compensation for those expropriations.’” As a consequence, the focus of the Parties’
submissions was on the scope of Respondent’s expropriation of Claimants’ property, the

lawfulness of the expropriation, and the proper quantum of compensation due as a consequence.

A Liability
1. Preliminary

Claimants base their claim in this arbitration on the Barbados BIT. They observe that the law
applicable to the substance of the claim is determined by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention,
and submit that the “rules of law ... agreed by the Parties’ pursuant to that provision are
recorded in the Barbados BIT itself, supplemented by general principles of international law.” ®
They submit that Venezuelan law is relevant to the extent that it bears on the scope of Claimants’
rights and Respondent’s obligations; while Article 11 of the Barbados BIT incorporates by
reference any principles of international law or Venezuelan law that are more favourable than
those imposed by the Treaty, equally Venezuelan law cannot be applied to the extent that it is

inconsistent with Respondent's international legal obligations.*®

Respondent does not take issue with these propositions.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

2. The scope of the expropriation

Claimants say that the effect of the Reserve Law and the associated administrative acts was to
directly expropriate valuable tangible assets belonging to Claimants, as well as to indirectly
expropriate their shares in SEMARCA itself, thus depriving Claimants of a business with a 50-year
history in Venezuela and a proven history of profitability. Respondent, by contrast, says that the
expropriations deprived Claimants of nothing more than a piece of land at La Cafiada (together
with buildings and inventory), 15 vessels (which, as a consequence of the Decision on Jurisdiction,
are beyond the competence of the Tribunal, being owned by Tidewater companies outside the
scope of the Barbados BIT) and the short period remaining in the terms of two contracts with

PDVSA Petrdleo.
(a) Claimants’ submissions

Claimants begin by noting that Article 5(1) of the Barbados BIT prohibits both direct and indirect
expropriation. It defines the latter as State measures which ‘interfere with property rights to
such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been
expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have expropriated them and the legal

title to the property formally remains with the original owner.’?°

Thus, Claimants submit that following the enactment of the Reserve Law on 7 May 2009, and the
Ministerial designation of Claimants on 8 May 2009, Respondent’s expropriation consisted of
three elements:7*
a) On 8 May 2009, direct expropriation of SEMARCA’s headquarters, operations
and assets on Lake Maracaibo, as well as certain real estate owned by the Second
Claimant at La Cafiada.
b) On 12 July 2009, direct expropriation of Claimants’ offshore assets and
operations in the Gulf of Paria.
c) As a consequence of all Respondent’s acts, indirect expropriation of Claimants’

rights and interests in SEMARCA, including their shareholding.

Claimants note that Respondent concedes the first stage of expropriation.”* However, Claimants
explain that the expropriation itself had wider effects on SEMARCA’s other operations in the
country, because its operations in the Gulf of Paria were deprived of access to dispatchers,

mechanics or spare parts located in La Cafiada.”?

As to the second stage, Claimants reject Respondent’s argument that because the Reserve Law
only applied by its terms to Lake Maracaibo, Claimants were (and remain) free to operate
offshore. They note that, on 12 July 2009, Respondent seized four vessels operating offshore in
support of the Corocoro Project, that this had the effect of terminating the Corocoro contract
which was still on foot,”4 and that this seizure was undertaken pursuant to the Reserve Law. They
also rely on the Tribunal’s finding in the Decision on Jurisdiction that on 12 July 2009 ‘the
Claimants’ remaining assets and operations in Venezuela were expropriated.’ The inference

that Claimants would have the Tribunal draw is that they did not remain free to operate offshore.

As to the third stage, Claimants say that Respondent’s implementation of the Reserve Law
deprived the Second Claimant of control over SEMARCA, as demonstrated by: (i) multiple
Venezuelan court decisions which recognise that SEMARCA has become part of, or is represented
by, PDVSA; (ii) the fact that the Second Claimant was barred from registering documents for
SEMARCA in the Commercial Registry; (iii) letters from SEMARCA’s officers to the Respondent
explaining that they had been effectively removed from office; and (iv) integration of SEMARCA

into the PDVSA business.”°

Claimants further submit that Respondent’s acts have rendered the shares in SEMARCA
worthless (and that they do not enjoy the benefit of the accounts receivable because they have

lost control over the company).””

Claimants say that Respondent’s argument that they could not have suffered indirect
expropriation because Claimants lacked proprietary rights capable of expropriation is a red

herring: their shares in SEMARCA were undoubtedly a proprietary right and they have been

deprived of the benefit of that right. It is not necessary that Claimants identify any long-term

contractual rights beyond that investment to make out a case of indirect expropriation.”°
(b) Respondent’s submissions

Respondent says that Claimants have confused expropriation by a State with reservation of an
area of activity within its borders.? It says that all that was expropriated were the vessels, the
tangible assets at La Cafiada, and the short periods remaining on the two Lake Maracaibo

contracts.*>

As to the contracts, Respondent says that the Reserve Law only expropriated a short period
remaining on two contracts (the Towing Contract and Supply Vessels Contract), each of which
had only 24 days left to run and no right of renewal. Respondent says that because the Reserve
Law only applied to Lake Maracaibo, the offshore contracts were not expropriated and expired
according to their terms: the Corocoro Contract expired on 30 June 2009 (52 days after the
enactment of the Reserve Law) because renewal terms were not agreed;** and the Cardén
Contract expired on 23 May 2009 but continued until 12 June 2009, 35 days after the enactment
of the Law (after which Chevron chose not to extend it because the project was not

commercial).32

Respondent also says that the limited scope of the Reserve Law left the company free to operate
elsewhere in Venezuela, and that this is demonstrated by the fact that the Claimants continued
to negotiate with Repsol in respect of the Rafael Urdaneta Cardon IV Project after the enactment
of the Reserve Law.*? It says that in consequence there can be ‘no issue of compensation with
respect to any business outside of the reserved area.’*“ The seizure of the four vessels serving

the Corocoro Project does not demonstrate that the Reserve Law applied outside Lake

Maracaibo, because all four vessels were registered there and three had been used for maritime

support services on the Lake.?°

As to the allegation of indirect expropriation, Respondent says that nothing in the Reserve Law
affects the ownership or control of SEMARCA. It submits that SEMARCA continued to receive
payments in its own name after the enactment of the Reserve Law, continued to operate and
negotiate offshore contracts, and that the Claimants remain in control of its accounts
receivable.*° Respondent says it did not take possession and control of SEMARCA or remove its
officers.?” Respondent says the SEMARCA officers’ letters on which Claimants rely were self-
serving and written after the expropriation in order to ‘create a record of “indirect

expropriation’’.**

Respondent says that, in the absence of a property right owned by SEMARCA being taken, there
can be no indirect expropriation.*° In other words, Claimants cannot make an expropriation
claim for rights or interests that Claimants never had.“° In circumstances where Claimants remain
the legal owners of the shares in SEMARCA, Claimants have not identified any substantial assets
or rights held by SEMARCA the taking of which deprived the company of its value.*? Respondent
says that Claimants seek compensation for the loss of a ‘vested right to continue to do business

with PDVSA’ that they never possessed.*?

3. Whether the expropriation was lawful or unlawful
(a) Claimants’ submissions

Claimants say that Respondent’s expropriation is unlawful because it fails to respect two of the
conditions imposed by Article 5(1) of the Treaty: that the expropriation be taken ‘against prompt,

adequate and effective compensation’; and that it be carried out on a non-discriminatory basis.

Compensation: Claimants note that the Barbados BIT requires that any expropriation be
accompanied by payment of compensation which amounts to the market value of the
investment expropriated, calculated before the expropriation (or when the impending
expropriation became public knowledge).“? Claimants thus begin by submitting that the mere
failure of Respondent to pay compensation in accordance with the BIT renders the expropriation
unlawful.“* They note that Respondent's representative rejected the proposal to pay immediate
but partial compensation consisting of all the accounts receivable, and indicated that assets
would be valued on a book-value basis.*° Claimants say that Respondent was required, at the
least, to make a ‘good-faith determination of the fair market value of the investment ... and to
tender that amount promptly’ without prejudice to subsequent proceedings by Claimants to
challenge its quantum. “° They cite authority for the proposition that a failure to offer
compensation,” or Treaty-compliant compensation,*® renders the expropriation unlawful. They
distinguish the authorities on which Respondent relies on the basis that they either concerned
expropriation without compensation under customary international law standard, or they

involved distinguishable Treaty provisions.*°

In any case, they submit that because the Reserve Law requires Respondent to pay

compensation only on a book-value basis, and prohibits the compensation of ‘lost profits or

indirect damages’, the Reserve Law forbids Respondent from paying the compensation required

by the BIT, and this renders the expropriation unlawful.°°

Discrimination: Claimants submit that, under the Treaty, an expropriation will be unlawful unless
it is carried out ‘on a non-discriminatory basis’. They say that the expropriation of SEMARCA was
unlawful because not all similarly situated providers of maritime support services to the oil and
natural gas industry in Venezuela received equal treatment. In particular, they say that three

other operators were treated more favourably than SEMARCA:*+

i. Gulmar Offshore Middle East L.L.C. (Gulmar Offshore), a United Arab Emirates
company, was one of the operators on Lake Maracaibo specifically designated
in Resolution No. 51. After Respondent seized three vessels owned by Gulmar
Offshore in accordance with that Resolution, it subsequently returned them
and the company continued to operate in Venezuela (including taking on
services formerly provided by SEMARCA). Claimants reject Respondent’s
explanation that PDVSA did not have the expertise to operate the vessels as
the reason for returning them, because this exception was not provided for in

the Reserve Law.

ii. Guanta Consult, C.A. & Servicios Picardi, C.A. (Servipica), a Venezuelan
competitor of SEMARCA who was not listed in Resolution No. 51 and whose
assets were not expropriated. Servipica ultimately went on to contract its
vessels to Repsol on the Cardon IV project, an operation that Claimants had

been in negotiations to service.
iii. Astilleros de Venezuela, C.A. (Astivenca), a Venezuelan company, also
operated offshore and was not subject to expropriation.
(a) Respondent’s submissions
Compensation: On the facts, Respondent says that it engaged in compensation discussions with
Claimants, but those could not proceed because Claimants insisted on an overly-broad

confidentiality agreement. It says that agreement on compensation has also been hampered by

Claimants’ insistence on seeking compensation for rights SEMARCA never had.*?

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

On the law, Respondent submits that an expropriation is not rendered unlawful by the mere fact
that compensation has not been paid, provided that the government ‘recognises the obligation
to compensate.’*? Respondent points out that in the Chorzéw Factory case (as followed in
LIAMCO), the expropriation was unlawful because the Government of Poland did not have the
right to expropriate the property in question under the applicable Treaty, and that, if Poland had
been entitled to expropriate, then the appropriate standard of compensation would have been
‘the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession’ even if Poland had failed to pay
any compensation.* Respondent submits that the concept of ‘provisional payment’ invoked by

Claimants has no support in the authorities.°>

Respondent distinguishes the five cases which Claimants cite for the proposition that the mere
failure to pay compensation renders an expropriation unlawful, arguing that in those exceptional
cases the State had never made an offer of compensation, or had offered compensation so low
as to be non-existent.°* In Respondent’s submission, Article 6 of the Reserve Law does not
prohibit compliance with the Treaty’s terms as to compensation and there is no basis for

assuming that the State intended to breach its international obligations in enacting the Law.°”
Discrimination: Respondent says that it did not act in a discriminatory fashion:

i. The vessels belonging to Gulmar Offshore were returned because PDVSA did
not have the expertise to operate them. Respondent also suggests that the
treatment of Gulmar Offshore’s vessels was consistent with the treatment of
the Claimants’ vessels President Tide and High Quest (which were released by
the Respondent), because in both cases they were foreign-flagged and had all-

international crews. Respondent also says that Gulmar Offshore is in dispute

Servipica, by contrast, was not operating in Lake Maracaibo at the time of the

Reserve Law and therefore was not included in Resolution No. 51.

Astivenca was included in Resolution No. 51 and its assets in Lake Maracaibo

were expropriated.

4. Other breaches of the Barbados BIT

(a) Claimants’ submissions

Claimants also allege that the Respondent’s conduct constitutes a breach of three other

protections afforded by the Barbados BIT:

Fair and equitable treatment: Article 2(2) of the BIT guarantees investors ‘fair
and equitable treatment in accordance with the rules and principles of
International law’. A ‘central pillar’ of the BIT’s guarantee is the protection of
legitimate expectations, and Claimants say that Respondent violated their
legitimate expectation (rooted in the BIT and Venezuela’s Constitution) that
their investment would not be expropriated without compensation. Claimants
submit, in particular, that the Venezuelan Constitution requires compensation
to be paid before any seizure. Claimants say that the Treaty protection is not
qualified by the (lower) customary international law minimum standard of
treatment of aliens, but even that standard prohibits expropriation without

compensation.

Arbitrary or discriminatory measures: Article 2(2) also prohibits the

impairment of investments by arbitrary or discriminatory measures. Claimants

say that Respondent’s measures were arbitrary because they violated the BIT

and the Constitution, and discriminatory for the reasons described above.™

National treatment and most-favoured nation treatment: Claimants also say

 

that the discriminatory nature of Respondent’s conduct constitutes a

freestanding violation of Article 3 of the BIT.©

(b) Respondent’s submissions

Respondent says that Claimants’ other causes of action under the BIT add nothing to their claim

of expropriation:

Fair and equitable treatment: Respondent says that the guarantee in Article
2(2) of the BIT is the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment. Claimants do not claim they had a right to operate in Venezuela in
perpetuity and Respondent has a sovereign right to reserve certain activities
to itself. This claim therefore boils down to an allegation that compensation
has not been paid and adds nothing to the primary claim. That argument
cannot succeed because Respondent has always recognised its obligation to

compensate.

Arbitrary or discriminatory measures, national treatment and most-favoured

 

nation treatment: These claims simply recycle Claimants’ allegation of

discriminatory expropriation.”

B Compensation

At the close of the written phase, the calculations proffered by the respective experts were some

distance apart. Claimants’ experts quantified the total claim at between US $217m and US

$234m on an ex post basis, and between US $103m and US $141m on an ex ante basis. ®

Respondent’s experts, by contrast, concluded that the proper quantum of compensation was US

$1.68m.°

It became apparent during the hearing that much of the difference between the valuations was
attributable to the different assumptions that the experts had adopted, in some cases on
instruction from counsel.’° During the hearing, both Parties’ experts were given an opportunity
to make a brief direct presentation of their evidence to the Tribunal, before being cross-
examined and questioned by the Tribunal. Subsequently, and at the request of the Tribunal, each
Party’s experts produced revised valuations on the basis of alternative assumptions. In this
section, the Tribunal first outlines the different approach the Parties took to the valuation

exercise, before explaining the valuation figures presented by the experts during the hearing.

1. Standard of compensation and date for assessment of compensation
(a) Claimants’ submissions

Claimants say that they are entitled to restitutio in integrum: that is, compensation to place them
in the position they would have been absent the Respondent’s wrongful acts.” At a minimum,
they are entitled to the fair market value of the SEMARCA Enterprise (which they define to
include the value of their equity in SEMARCA plus the value of the part of the terminal at La
Cafiada occupied by the company”) as a going concern before the expropriation measures
became public (the ex ante approach). On this approach, the business is valued on the basis of
reasonable expectations at that date.”? But Claimants submit that, because the expropriation
was unlawful, they are entitled to be compensated for the net cash flows that they would have
enjoyed between the date of the expropriation and the date of this Award, plus the value of the

SEMARCA Enterprise at the later date (the ex post approach).”*

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

Claimants say that the prescribed standard of compensation in Article 5(1) of the BIT represents
the condition for a lawful expropriation, but that Article 5(1) does not prescribe the standard of
compensation that is payable for an expropriation which the Tribunal has found to be unlawful
or wrongful.”> Consequently, the applicable standard is supplied by customary international law
as reflected in the Chorzéw Factory case, requiring reparation to ‘wipe out all the consequences
of the illegal act’.”° This equates to the Claimants’ ex post approach.” The same standard applies
to any breach of the BIT (such as a violation of the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment).”
Claimants say that although ‘in most adjudicated expropriation disputes’ compensation has been
assessed at the date of expropriation, in those cases either additional compensation was not

sought or there was insufficient evidence to determine the increase in value.”°

Claimants say that if compensation is to be assessed at the date of dispossession, it must exclude
the adverse impact of pre-expropriation measures that were taken to reduce the value of the

Claimants’ interests.®°
(b) Respondent’s submissions

Respondent begins by submitting that there is no difference between an ex ante and ex post
valuation in this case, because, for the reasons described above, the Respondent did not

expropriate the SEMARCA Enterprise itself.**

To the extent that the valuation date might make a difference, Respondent says that Article 5(1)
of the BIT stipulates the standard of compensation. It is not limited by its terms to ‘lawful’
expropriations, and authority supports the proposition that the standard of compensation set by
the applicable Treaty should apply regardless of whether the expropriation is lawful (but

particularly where the only ‘wrongful’ conduct is the non-payment of compensation). *”

2. Method of valuation
(a) Claimants’ submissions

On Claimants’ preferred ex post approach, their experts calculated compensation in two
tranches: (i) the lost net cash flows of the SEMARCA Enterprise from 7 May 2009 until the date
of the Award; and (ii) the fair market value of the SEMARCA Enterprise at the date of the Award.

As to the value of the business itself, Claimants adopt the ‘willing buyer/willing seller’ approach
endorsed by, inter alia, the World Bank Guidelines,** and say that on the ex post approach the
investor is entitled to the higher of the business’s value at the time of dispossession or the value
it would have had at the date of the Award taking into account the profits that would have been
earned in the interim in valuing the business.®° Claimants’ experts utilise a combination of
valuation methodologies: primarily (i) a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis, assisted by (ii) the
comparable publicly traded companies approach and (iii) the comparable transactions
approach.*° To implement the DCF approach, Claimants’ experts project future cash flows
through to 31 March 2019 (using the same general methodology as for the period 2009-2013)
and determine the remaining value of the business beyond 2019 with a terminal (or residual)

value calculation.®”
(b) Respondent’s submissions

Respondent’s primary position is that it is not appropriate to value the SEMARCA Enterprise at
all, because it was not expropriated. To the extent that it is necessary to value the business, the
Respondent’s experts say that a DCF valuation alone is appropriate, and reject Claimants experts’

comparable companies and transactions approaches for the reasons given below.

3. Elements of the valuation
(a) Scope of the business

The Parties dispute the scope and long-term prospects of SEMARCA’s business at the date of the

expropriation.

Claimants: As to the long-term prospects of the business, Claimants dispute the Respondent’s
contention that SEMARCA was vulnerable to ‘stiff competition’ and the risk of PDVSA bringing
services ‘in-house’ .** They say that SEMARCA had a proven track record of success and numerous
competitive advantages, and was one of the few companies well placed to service the increased
demand after 2009.*° As a result, the fact that SEMARCA had no guaranteed right to future
contracts on the Lake is not a good reason to ignore its future earning capacity.°° They say that
PDVSA had no viable internalisation plan, submit that the market would not have regarded
PDVSA’s isolated ‘musings’ as a realistic threat to SEMARCA’s prospects, and say that, in any case,

the limited plans were largely focused on services that SEMARCA did not provide.**

On the assumption that the Tribunal takes into account business that Claimants would have
undertaken in the period between expropriation and the date of this Award, Claimants point to
several offshore projects that they say would have resulted in an expansion of their business. In
particular, they identify: the Rafael Urdaneta Project, a large natural gas drilling operation north
of Lake Maracaibo (of which the Cardén III Project, to which SEMARCA briefly contributed two
vessels — High Quest and President Tide — was a part); the Mariscal Sucre Project, in which
PDVSA has committed to invest;°? and the Plataforma Deltana Project off the east coast of
Venezuela, in respect of which SEMARCA was in discussions at the time of the expropriation.**
They do not say that the projects on-going at the date of expropriation would necessarily have

continued, but that Claimants would have captured a sufficient share of the offshore business to

employ the existing vessels plus six more.°° As noted above, Claimants dispute the suggestion

that they are still free to exploit offshore opportunities.%°

Respondent: Respondent stresses that after 1975 Claimants had a single customer in Lake
Maracaibo: PDVSA and its subsidiaries. °” Whatever its trading history, SEMARCA had no
guarantee of continuing operation and was subject to the risk that the State would choose to
reserve activities in Lake Maracaibo to itself, as it did.°* PDVSA had firm internalisation plans,

and all the Reserve Law did was to expedite them.

Respondent submits that the Reserve Law does not prevent the Claimants participating in
offshore operations. 1 It nevertheless says that the record belies Claimants’ hypothetical
expansion plans in Rafael Urdaneta, Mariscal Sucre and Plataforma Deltana,?™ in circumstances
where SEMARCA’s actual business there was ‘virtually non-existent’.1°? Respondent thus says
that Claimants have failed to establish what the 17 vessels that Claimants assume would have
operated in Venezuela would have been doing,** noting in particular that the President Tide and

High Quest left Venezuela after the Chevron Contract concluded. !*

Respondent says that Claimants’ damages claim is speculative, impermissibly assumes that
SEMARCA would continue providing services into perpetuity, and is contrary to authority that
damages should not be awarded on the assumption that contracts would be renewed when
there was no right of renewal.*° It says that no hypothetical buyer would value SEMARCA on

that basis.1°°

(b) Accounts receivable and working capital

The Parties agree that the accounts receivable owed to SEMARCA totalled US $44,888,040 as at
8 May 2009. However they dispute how the accounts receivable should be treated in the

calculation of damages.

Claimants say that because they have been deprived of control or operation of SEMARCA, they
are not able to collect the accounts receivable.*”” They submit that if the expropriatory acts had
not been committed, it is reasonable to think that PDVSA would have been able to satisfy the
obligations, and thus include the accounts receivable in their assessment of damages. 1°
Nevertheless, they assume that some of the amount outstanding at January 2009 would have
remained outstanding, and some would have gone to pay off supplier liabilities, so only include
US $16.48m in their calculations.*°? They thus say that Respondent’s experts have wrongly

excluded most of SEMARCA’s working capital from their calculation.1?°

Respondent relies on Claimants’ assertion in the document production phase that they ‘are not
seeking payment of those accounts receivable in this proceeding’! and their experts were
accordingly instructed to exclude accounts receivable from their calculations. 4? When
instructed to include the accounts receivable in their calculations, Respondent’s experts

subtracted US $27,464,640 in current liabilities, leaving a recoverable total of $17,423,400.13

(c) Cash flow

The Parties dispute whether, for the purpose of calculating cash flows in the DCF analysis, it is
appropriate to adopt a three-year spread of historical cash flows (i.e. FY2006 to FY2008) or a
four-year spread (FY2006 to 2009). Claimants’ expert includes FY2009 in his calculations. 11
Respondent’s experts opine that this has a distorting effect on the figures, since FY2009 was a
year of historically high oil revenues, which had a consequent effect on day rates that could be

commanded by SEMARCA.*2>

(d) Discount rate

Claimants: Having calculated cash flows, Claimants’ experts discount them to the valuation date
by calculating SEMARCA’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). This takes into account
both the cost of equity and the cost of debt. To calculate the cost of equity, Claimants’ expert
uses the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which takes into account three principal factors: (i)
the rate of return for risk-free investments; (ii) the equity risk premium; (iii) a measure of system
risk associated with a given security relative to the market as a whole (known as the beta value);
and add (iv) a country risk premium."° As a preliminary point, Claimants say that Respondent’s
experts use the wrong industry code when extracting data from the Ibbotson/Morningstar Cost
of Capital Yearbook, which itself produces a 3.74 per cent reduction in WACC.™"” As to the
individual components of the discount rate:

a) For the risk-free rate, Claimants’ expert uses the ten-year historical average yield

on United States Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities. ""*

b) For the equity risk premium, Claimants’ expert used 5.0 per cent, said to be an

approximate average of the range of estimates recommended in empirical

studies."° Claimants say that Respondent’s premium is based on a single source

and, at 6.5 per cent, is at the top end of the usual range of 3.5 to 7 per cent.?”°

For the asset beta, the expert used a sample of comparable companies to derive
an unlevered beta of 0.618, adjusting the figures for an assumed debt/equity ratio
of 10:90 for SEMARCA. He justifies the low ratio on the basis that SEMARCA leased
its vessels, meaning it had modest financing needs. 74 He says that if the
Respondent’s experts were to use the right Ibbotson/Morningstar industry code,

the applicable beta is 0.69.17

For the country risk premium (which accounts for two-thirds of the difference in
overall discount rate between the respective experts), Claimants’ expert excludes
the impact of ‘certain Venezuelan government policies, such as its nationalisation
agenda, which heightened the level of legal, regulatory and political risk’.17? He
says that expropriation risk must be excluded because the BIT protects against
it, and criticises Respondent’s experts’ reliance on the Ibbotson-Morningstar
report because it is based on empirical data that inevitably incorporates such
risks.125 That leaves currency risk (assessed as low because most profits were in
US Dollars); macroeconomic risk (also assessed as low because of the vital role of
the maritime support service sector in the Venezuelan economy); and social risk
such as the risk of labour unrest (assessed as moderate). Moreover, Claimants say
that recent data suggests that investors in real world transactions are not applying

significant ‘country risk’ discounts. 1° They distinguish the cases on which

per cent.

Finally, the expert calculates the cost of debt based on average rates at which

comparable companies could borrow in US Dollars for the three years prior to

expropriation, settling on 6.68 per cent.?78

business risk:

buyer might in principle discount a company’s value to account for high
customer concentration, Claimants say the risk to SEMARCA was reduced
because PDVSA already had a diversified customer base and a long history of

continuous operation.°

Claimants say that geographic concentration was not a significant risk because
no prospective buyer would have been concerned that the market for

SEMARCA’s services would suddenly dry up.3+

Finally, Claimants dispute the addition of Respondent’s alpha premium of 2.27
per cent and small-company size premium of 1.08%, because they do not

reflect how a willing buyer would have valued SEMARCA in real life.1°?

In combination, and assuming a debt/equity ratio of 10:90, Claimants’ expert proposes a WACC

of 6.96 per cent.*?? For the purpose of valuing the SEMARCA Enterprise, the Claimants’ expert

between the WACC and the long-term growth rate of the economy.‘ Using a valuation date of

31 December 2013 (i.e. the ex post approach), Claimants’ expert produced a valuation for the

SEMARCA Enterprise of US $153,781,338.1*° On the ex ante approach, they produce a valuation
of US $81,677,467 at 8 May 2009, plus interest.19°

to value the SEMARCA Enterprise itself), Respondent’s experts adopt the following approach:

d

In calculating a discount rate, the experts take into account three elements:
the cost of equity for an on-going concern operating in SEMARCA’s field in a
mature economy; the cost of equity due to country risk and the cost of debt

to SEMARCA.3”

Respondent’s experts use the CAPM and International Capital Asset Pricing
Model (ICAPM) methods, and in particular the Ibbotson/Morningstar
implementation of the ICAPM method, confirmed by reference to the

‘bludgeon method’ of Professor Damodaran.*

As to equity risk, Respondent’s experts adopt 6.5%.*°° They explain that this
figure represents the most accurate long-term cost of equity capital and it is
supported by both the Ibbotson-Morningstar report, which collates data from
1926 to the valuation date, and other published data sources.*“° Respondent’s
experts maintain that Claimants’ figure is not reliable, as it is based on data

that post-dates the valuation date.

As to country risk, Respondent says that the discount rate adopted by
Claimants’ expert would not even be appropriate for a project in the United

States. In reliance on Himpurna, AMT, Lemire and Mobil Cerro Negro,

Respondent says that much higher country risk must be assigned.*“" It says
that Claimants’ exclusion of factors such as expropriation risk is based on a
mistaken premise. The rule that the value of an asset must be assessed at a
date before the announcement of the specific expropriation does not mean
that one must ignore the general risk of government intervention that has
always accompanied the investment activities in Venezuela, including the risk
that the government would reserve a certain sector of activity to the State. 1?
It is no answer to say that such risks are controlled by the State."#? Nor does
the BIT permit that risk to be excluded from the analysis.1“* The Respondent’s
experts propose a country risk rate on equity of 14.76%, and on debt of

11.89%, "45

Respondent also says, in reliance on the expert report of Professor Wells, that
a significant discount must be applied to take account of business risk, driven
by the fact that SEMARCA operated on the basis of short-term contracts with
no long term commitments, and because of SEMARCA’s dependence on a
single customer.’*° Respondent says that Claimants confuse ‘single customer’
risk with ‘single supplier’ risk, “4” and have no answer to the risk of
internalisation.*“°

Taking into account an appropriate debt/equity ratio, Respondent’s experts

calculated an overall discount rate of 24.57%.“

(e) Comparable companies and transactions

78. Claimants: Claimants’ experts supplement their DCF calculation by examining both comparable

companies and comparable transactions:

a) The experts identify three publicly traded companies most directly
comparable to SEMARCA, assign each a comparability rating and then weight
their EV/EBIT multiple accordingly. Multiplying SEMARCA’s projected EBIT for
2013 by the weighted EBIT multiple produces an enterprise value. +? The
experts dispute Respondent’s claim that the selected companies are
associated with very different country risk profiles, because much of the
difference is attributed to uncompensated expropriation risk and related risks,
and because there is no correlation between the ‘in country’ cost of equity

and the EV/EBIT valuation multiples of the selected companies.1**

The experts adopt a similar approach for comparable transactions, identifying

six in the period 2010 to 2013 that are potentially comparable to SEMARCA.*55

each of the firms selected by Claimants operates its own vessels; the firms do not work
exclusively in one geographic area or for a single customer; all the firms are much larger than

SEMARCA; and Claimants do not account for different country risks.15°

4. Interest
(a) Claimants’ submissions

Claimants seek both pre-award and post-award interest, in each case calculated on a compound
basis. 1°” Claimants propose that the rate should be calculated by reference to Venezuela’s
sovereign debt rate, because otherwise Claimants would have been forced to serve as
compulsory creditors to Respondent. Alternatively, they propose a ‘normal commercial rate’ as
required by the BIT. Their experts propose the US Prime Rate + 2 per cent, or LIBOR + 4 per cent
as alternatives to Venezuela’s sovereign bond rate.’** They say that Respondent's proposed rate

cannot be considered a normal commercial rate.**°
(b) Respondent’s submissions

Respondent says that pre-award interest should be based on a short-term and risk-free rate,
such as the 3-month US Treasury bond plus 1.33 per cent. Otherwise, Claimants would be
compensated for risks they did not bear.’ It maintains that simple interest is appropriate as a

matter of Venezuelan and international law.*®

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

A Liability
In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided that ‘[i]t has jurisdiction over the claims of
Tidewater Barbados and Tidewater Caribe pursuant to Article 8 of the Barbados BIT to the extent
that such claims concern alleged breaches of the obligations of the Respondent under that Treaty
arising after 9 March 2009’.** It found that all of the other claims advanced by all other
Claimants fell outside its jurisdiction and could not proceed within the framework of the present

arbitration. This included, materially, the claims for alleged expropriation of their vessels brought

by affiliates of Tidewater Barbados within the Tidewater group that owned each of the vessels

used by SEMARCA in the operation of its business in Venezuela.

In arriving at its Decision, the Tribunal had to consider the present Claimants’ allegations of fact
as to the acts of Respondent that gave rise to its claims. The Tribunal had to make an evaluation
of these facts. The gravamen of Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction under the BIT (ultimately
rejected by the Tribunal) was that Claimants’ invocation of Respondent’s consent to arbitration
under the BIT was an abuse of process, since the dispute which is the subject of the present
proceedings was already in existence, or could reasonably have been foreseen at the time
Tidewater Barbados was incorporated and the ownership of Tidewater Caribe transferred to it.

This turned on questions of fact.1%

However, it is axiomatic that no findings of fact made by an international tribunal in the context
of a jurisdictional challenge can bind it in its subsequent determination of the merits of the
dispute. On the contrary, an arbitral tribunal must, for the purpose of its jurisdictional
determination, presume the facts that found the claim on the merits as alleged by the claimant
to be true (unless they are plainly without any foundation). In that sense, its determination may
be said to be prima facie. In the application of those presumed facts to the legal question of
jurisdiction before it, the tribunal must objectively characterise those facts in order to determine
finally whether they fall within or outside the scope of the Parties’ consent. In making this
determination, the tribunal may not simply adopt the claimant’s characterisation without
examination. In this way, a tribunal whose jurisdiction is contested strikes the balance between
avoiding pre-judging the merits, on the one hand, and objectively determining the question of
jurisdiction on the other. This is the consistent jurisprudence of the International Court of

Justice, and of ICSID tribunals.

It follows therefore that the Tribunal approaches the determination of Respondent’s substantive
liability to Claimants, if any, entirely afresh and on the basis of the evidentiary record presented

to it in the written and oral phase on the merits.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

1. Expropriation
(a) Cause of action

The first and principal cause of action pleaded by Claimants is that Respondent expropriated
Claimants’ investments in Venezuela without payment of prompt, adequate and effective

compensation in breach of Article 5 of the BIT.1©
The Tribunal analyses this claim in the following four steps:

(a) First, it considers the constituent elements of the cause of action provided by the Contracting

States in Article 5 of the BIT itself;

(b) Second, it identifies and analyses the relevant State measures alleged to constitute the

expropriatory acts;

(c) Third, it assesses whether, and if so to what extent, those measures did in fact have an

expropriatory effect; and,
(d) Fourth, it considers whether, if so, such expropriation was lawful or unlawful.
Article 5 provides:

(1) Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised,
expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as "expropriation") in the territory of the other Contracting
Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party on a non-
discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such
compensation shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately
before the expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge,
whichever is the earlier, shall include interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of
payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realizable and be freely transferable. The
national or company affected shall have a right, under the law of the Contracting Party making
the expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party,
of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set

out in this paragraph.

(2) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated or
constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which nationals or

companies of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate
and effective compensation in respect of their investment to such nationals or companies of the

other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.

The term ‘investment’ is defined in Article 1 to mean ‘every kind of asset invested by nationals
or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party’. Such

assets include, inter alia, shares in a company,’®” goodwill and know-how.*®

Article 5 is in a form commonly found in many investment treaties. It does not prohibit the
expropriation of investments. Rather, each Contracting Party undertakes only to expropriate if

certain specified conditions are met. The expropriation must be:

(a) ‘for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party’;
(b) ‘on a non-discriminatory basis’; and

(c) ‘against prompt, adequate and effective compensation’.

The Contracting States extend these protections to ‘measures having effect equivalent to
nationalisation or expropriation.’ They also undertake to provide prompt judicial or
independent review of an investor’s case or the valuation of its investment in accordance with

the principles set out in Article 5.

(b)Relevant measures

Four measures were relied upon as constituting acts by which Respondent expropriated

Claimants’ investments in Venezuela:
(i) Reserve Law of 7 May 2009;7°°
(ii) Ministerial Resolution No 51 of 8 May 2009;7”°

(iii) Physical seizure of SEMARCA’s business operations at La Cafiada, Lake Maracaibo
on 9 May 2009; and,

(iv) Physical seizure of SEMARCA’s business operation at Corocoro on 12 July 2009.

It is necessary to take each of these measures in turn.

(i) Reserve Law

The Reserve Law itself, adopted by the National Assembly of Venezuela on 7 May 2009, is
entitled: Organic Law that Reserves to the State Assets and Services related to Primary Activities

of Hydrocarbons.

Its object is set forth in Article 1 as being ‘the reservation for the State, because of their strategic
character, of assets and services related to the performance of the primary activities
contemplated in the Organic Law on Hydrocarbons.’ These activities are henceforth to be carried
out by PDVSA, or its designated subsidiary, or through mixed enterprises controlled by them.

They are declared to be a public service and of public and social interest.17*

The assets and services thus reserved include ‘[t]hose related to the activities in Lake Maracaibo:
vessels for [diverse purposes]; maintenance of vessels in workshops, piers or docks of any
nature.’!”? The Ministry of the Popular Power for Energy and Petroleum with competence on oil
matters (the Ministry) is empowered to determine by resolution the specific assets and services
of enterprises that fall within the Law.’ All subsisting agreements in connection with the
reserved activities are to terminate by operation of law.’” As of the date of publication of the
Law, PDVSA or its designated subsidiary ‘shall take possession of the assets and control of the

operations referred to [as] the reserved activities’ .1”°

The National Executive is empowered to decree the total or partial expropriation of the shares
or assets of companies performing the reserved activities. ?”° The just price for any such
expropriation shall be limited to the book value of the assets. ‘[I]n no event there shall be taken

into account lost profits or indirect damages.’!””

As summarised above, the Reserve Law had two functions: (a) the reservation to the State in the
public interest of the oil industry support functions there specified; coupled with (b) the
nationalisation of the assets and operations of the private companies then carrying out such

activities and services.

These two functions were interlinked. Mr Figuera, a witness called by Respondent, who at that
time was General Manager of the Offshore Mixed Companies for Corporacién Venezolana del

Petrdleo SA (CVP), a wholly-owned subsidiary of PDVSA, testified before the Tribunal:

[O]ur operations in Lake Maracaibo are huge. We have more than 7,000 Wells. All independent,
isolated. 7,000 Wells, we have more than 17,000 kilometers of pipeline laying out in the bottom
of the lake. We have ... about 200 flow stations that we have to supervise and maintain and
operate. A huge amount of facilities, not to refer to the rigs, drilling rigs and all the barges that
are used to lay out the pipeline and do production and construction activities in Lake Maracaibo.
So, yes, although we have, as | mentioned, more than 400 vessels of our own, and we have always
had a large significant capacity to operate in the lake, yes, that’s not sufficient. And we depended
up to a point, a significant point, [we] depended upon contractors.
There are vessels that also we don’t have. We have only a few supply vessels, that’s not
something that we ever care for to develop.1”8
The conclusion that the Tribunal draws from the text of the Reserve Law and this evidence is that
Venezuela’s objective in reserving to the State the relevant oil service activities integrally
required the nationalisation of the assets and facilities of the private operators then operating
on Lake Maracaibo. Without such nationalisation, the object of the Reserve Law could not then

have been achieved.
(ii) Ministerial Resolution No 51 of 8 May 2009

The Ministerial Resolution contemplated by the Reserve Law was promulgated the following day,
Friday 8 May 2009.1” It recites: the ‘activities that were the object of outsourcing schemes ...
place the Venezuelan State in a situation of vulnerability’, such that it is necessary to ‘correct
and recover the dismemberment of essential aspects of the oil activity since such
dismemberment threatens the national sovereignty’. *®° It resolves that ‘[t]he services of

enterprises or sectors and assets ... and the enterprises that provide said activities that are

affected by the measure of seizure’ are a number of listed enterprises including SEMARCA.*®+
PDVSA or its designated subsidiary ‘is hereby instructed to take control of the operations and
immediate possession of the facilities, documentation, assets and equipment related to the

activities to which this Resolution refers’.*®?
(iii) Physical seizure of SEMARCA’s assets at La Cafiada on 8 May 2009

On the same day, Friday 8 May 2009, PDVSA assumed, as recorded in a contemporaneous judicial
minute ‘the possession of the assets and control of the operations related to the reserved
activities and corresponding to the operating headquarters of ... SEMARCA’.1®3 Mr. Kehoe, then
Manager of SEMARCA, describes this event in the following terms in his witness Statement:
At approximately 1:30 AM on 8 May 2009, the Venezuelan National Guard arrived at the
SEMARCA headquarters at La Cafiada, entered the facility, and took control. We did not receive
any notice that the Venezuelan National Guard was coming. At approximately 5:00 AM, three
buses arrived, loaded with many PDVSA employees dressed all in red. These PDVSA employees
also participated in the takeover of the facility. After the arrival of the National Guard, SEMARCA
managers were no longer allowed on the premises except for specific appointments that had to
be requested through the local PDVSA management. SEMARCA’s non-managerial employees
were expected to report for work after the takeover."

(iv) Physical seizure of SEMARCA’s assets at Corocoro on 12 July 2009

Subsequently, on 12 July 2009, PetroSucre, an affiliate of PDVSA, seized the remainder of
SEMARCA’s operations at Corocoro in the Gulf of Paria, including the four vessels operating there.
It instructed the crews of those vessels that they would henceforth be working for PetroSucre. 1°
Respondent does not dispute this taking.1®° It submits that the Reserve Law was limited to
services and activities in Lake Maracaibo.*®” When questioned by the Tribunal on why these

vessels were taken, Mr. Figuera answered:

481 article 1; item 31, whose activities are described as ‘[S]upply vessels with cranes for the transport of
materials, diesel, industrial water and other materials; tugs.’

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

The law, the Reserve Law, requested all vessels related to, underlined "related" to Lake
Maracaibo operations be taken, and these vessels were registered in Lake Maracaibo, that
belonged to the Lake Maracaibo fleet. These vessels worked in Lake Maracaibo eventually, and
in several times we noticed in the reports that these vessels moved from Corocoro to Lake
Maracaibo operations and performed services to our fleet-as part of the fleet in Lake

Maracaibo."

102. However that may be, the uncontradicted evidence is that these vessels were working, and

continued to work after the seizure at least for some time, for PetroSucre at Corocoro. Their

seizure brought to an end SEMARCA’s operations in Venezuela.

(c) Expropriatory effect

The next issue is whether these seizures had the effect of nationalisation or expropriation or
were ‘measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation’ of Claimants’

investment in Venezuela.

As the terms of Article 5 of the BIT confirm, it is well accepted in international law that
expropriation need not involve a taking of legal title to property. It is sufficient if the State’s
measures have an equivalent effect. As one tribunal put it:
When measures are taken by a State the effect of which is to deprive the investor of the use and
benefit of his investment even though he may retain nominal ownership of the respective rights
being the investment, the measures are often referred to as a "creeping" or "indirect"
expropriation, or, as in the BIT, as measures "the effect of which is tantamount to

expropriation". 28

In reaching an assessment of whether the measures had an effect equivalent to expropriation,
the Tribunal finds it useful to consider the factors relied upon by the tribunal in Pope & Talbot as

relevant in the determination of whether a State measure has such an effect, namely whether:
(a) The investment has been nationalised or the measure is confiscatory;

(b) The investor remains in control of the investment and directs its day-to-day operations, or

whether the State has taken over such management and control;

(c) The State now supervises the work of employees of the Investment; and,

(d) The State takes the proceeds of the company’s sales.1°°

Respondent accepts that the vessels were taken, but points out (correctly) that, as a result of the
Decision on Jurisdiction, the taking of the property in these vessels—whether on Lake Maracaibo
or at Corocoro-which were not owned by Claimants but by affiliates, is outside the jurisdiction
of the present Tribunal. It also accepts that it expropriated SEMARCA’s physical assets at La
Cafiada, but claims that these had a minimal value.'®! Nevertheless, it asserts that Claimants’
shares in SEMARCA were not, and have not been expropriated. Thus, it alleges, other assets of
SEMARCA, including its accounts receivable, remain in the hands of the Claimants, who remain
free to engage in other oil supply business in Venezuela outside the scope of the activities on

Lake Maracaibo reserved to the State under the Reserve Law.

Respondent points out that, after the first seizure on 8 May 2009, SEMARCA continued to assert
its ownership of the assets of the company; to claim payment of the accounts receivable (which
Claimants continued to carry in their books); and to seek redress for the seizure. It also continued
to perform its contracts with PetroSucre at Corocoro, and with Chevron, invoicing and seeking
payment for arrears on those contracts, and to negotiate contracts with Repsol in relation to
Venezuelan business. This conduct, Respondent claims, is consistent with Claimants’ continued

ownership of SEMARCA.*°2
Mr. Kehoe, when challenged on this under cross-examination, deposed:

[T]he expropriation for me was a transition period from the beginning, let’s say May 8th, up until
July 12th. In the beginning, we almost felt that this wasn’t really going to happen to us, but, as
the milestones went along, we found out that this was really the reality right up until the final
taking of the PetroSucre vessels on July 12th.??
The Tribunal has carefully considered this evidence. It accepts Mr. Kehoe’s account. The first
seizure took place without warning on the very day of the promulgation of the Ministerial
Resolution, the day after the passing of the Reserve Law itself. It removed Claimants from control

of the seat of their operations at La Cafiada. Claimants had operated an oil supply business in

Venezuela for fifty years at that stage. Whilst the seizure would have come as a surprise, the
Tribunal does not find it surprising that Claimants would not immediately accept its effect.
Moreover, the scope of that effect upon Claimants’ investment did not finally become clear until
the seizure of the remainder of the vessels at Corocoro some two months later. In these
circumstances, documents from Claimants asserting the continuation of their business in the
intervening period are consistent with a dawning realisation that their business had been
nationalised. They do not lend support for the proposition that, after 12 July 2009, Claimants

remained in effective control of SEMARCA, their investment in Venezuela.

On the contrary, contemporaneous evidence from the Venezuelan Courts supports the
conclusion that the business as a whole had been effectively nationalised. When employees of
SEMARCA brought labour suits against the company in June 2009 and December 2009, the
Courts directed that the suits be served on the Attorney General of the Republic. The record
showed that only when such service had been effected could the proceedings continue. The
Court explained, in the first case, this was ‘[b]ecause the Court notes the Respondent in this
proceedings, the corporate entity Tidewater Marine Service Compafiia Anonima, also known as
SEMARCA, has become a part of the State of Venezuela, this being a matter of public knowledge
within the country’. In the second case, the Court observed: ‘TIDEWATER MARINE SERVICE,
C.A. (SEMARCA) is an enterprise that was subject to expropriation pursuant to Resolution
Number 51... because it was deemed that said company is of a necessary and strategic character

to Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. and its subsidiaries’.1%°

This contemporaneous evidence is also corroborated by the testimony of witnesses called for
both by Claimants and Respondent at the hearing. Mr. Kehoe for Claimants deposed that, as a
result of the seizure, PDVSA obtained ‘the entire infrastructure as it were, actually, of our
business of SEMARCA in Venezuela at the time’.1°° Mr. Figuera for Respondent confirmed that
‘PDVSA Operaciones Acuaticas is now operating the vessels that belonged before to SEMARCA’.

As such ‘it has a director [with] personnel appointed to it’.19” He confirmed that, although it was

not yet separately incorporated, this was planned so that it would become its own cost and profit

centre.*%

The seizure applied to all of SEMARCA’s non-managerial employees, who were expected to work

for PDVSA after 8 May 2009 — both the ship crews and the shore-based staff.1°°

The Parties dispute whether the assets of SEMARCA that were the subject of the seizure included
its accounts receivable. Claimants allege that both Parties acknowledged this at the time.?”
Respondent alleges that Claimants are still entitled to sue to recover the accounts receivable,
either in the Venezuelan Courts or otherwise in accordance with the contractual dispute
resolution terms.”°! It points out that Chevron paid Claimants the dollar portion of the amounts

outstanding under its Venezuelan support contract after the seizure.

The Tribunal finds, in the light of the Venezuelan Court decisions referred to above, that
Claimants would not have been recognised as exercising effective control over SEMARCA such
that they could have pursued legal process in Venezuela for recovery of debts due to SEMARCA
in Venezuela. On the contrary, the Venezuelan Courts treated the State as the effective owner

of SEMARCA.

Before leaving this section, however, it is necessary to address one further submission advanced
on behalf of Respondent as to the scope of the expropriation. Respondent avers that the
property that is the subject of an expropriation can only be determined by reference to property
rights held under the host State law. 7°? Respondent alleges that, apart from the fixed assets, the
only property rights Claimants held at the date of the seizure were under two short-term
contracts with PDVSA. Thus, it claims, at best only the rights under these contracts may form the

subject matter of Claimants’ claim.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

Expropriation under international law undoubtedly contemplates property rights existing under
national law that have been taken by the State.7°? As the Iran-US Claims Tribunal put it in

Amoco:*™*

Expropriation, which can be defined as a compulsory transfer of property rights, may extend to
any right which can be the object of a commercial transaction, i.e., freely sold and bought, and
thus has a monetary value.

In Emmis v Hungary, the reason there could be no claim for expropriation was because the only

property right that the claimants in that case had acquired upon making their investment in

Hungary was a fixed-term broadcasting licence that had expired prior to the State measure

alleged to constitute the expropriation. For that reason, the claimants in that case, in their

contemporaneous regulatory filings, attached no value to their investment after the expiry of

the licence.?°

By contrast, in the present case, Claimants’ investment in Venezuela was begun many years
before on its acquisition of SEMARCA. It consisted in the operation of a business that was open-
ended as to time. The terms of the BIT confirm? that an investment is capable of including
goodwill and know-how as well as other tangible and intangible assets, including contractual
rights. Venezuelan law provides the same. Article 3(1) of the Investment Law 7°’ defines
‘Investment’ as including:
Every asset destined to the production of income, under any of the entrepreneurial or contractual
forms permitted by Venezuelan legislation, including personal and real property, tangible or
intangible, over which property rights and other rights in rem are exercised; negotiable
instruments; rights to any performance having an economic value; intellectual property rights,

including know how, prestige and good will...

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

It is uncontested that each of SEMARCA and Tidewater Caribe were companies in good standing
duly incorporated under Venezuelan law and that Venezuelan law recognises such assets as

property.

True it is that the short-term nature of the contracts through which SEMARCA conducted its
business in Venezuela, along with other factors, are elements that may be relevant in the
determination of the monetary value to be placed upon the business, were it to have been the
object of a commercial transaction (to utilise the language of Amoco). But this is a subsequent
issue to the establishment of a property right capable of expropriation. The Tribunal finds that

Claimants’ investment in SEMARCA was such a property right.

In sum, the effect of Respondent’s measures was the expropriation in fact of the whole of
Claimants’ investment in its subsidiary in Venezuela, SEMARCA. The value to be ascribed to that
investment for the purpose of determining any compensation to be awarded to Claimants for

their loss is a separate question, which will be addressed in Part B of the Tribunal’s analysis.

(d) Was the expropriation lawful or unlawful?

The Tribunal has found that Respondent did expropriate Claimants’ investment in SEMARCA in
Venezuela. The next question is to determine whether such expropriation is lawful or unlawful.
Article 5 of the BIT does not, after all, prohibit the State taking property by way of nationalisation
or expropriation. Rather it permits such a taking, but only under the conditions there specified.

That is to say, the expropriation must be:

(a) ‘for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party’;
(b) ‘on a non-discriminatory basis’; and

(c) ‘against prompt, adequate and effective compensation’.

If these conditions are met, the expropriation accords with the terms of the Treaty and is not
therefore a breach of international law. If the conditions are not met, the expropriation must be

treated as a breach of international law.

In the present case, neither Party disputes the first condition, namely that the expropriation was
for a public purpose related to the internal needs of Venezuela. The Parties do dispute the
lawfulness of the expropriation in relation to the second and third conditions: non-discrimination
and compensation. Claimants submit that the taking was discriminatory. They also point out that
the only compensation provided for under the Reserve Law was book value of the assets. The

Law expressly excluded lost profits. This, by definition, did not meet the Treaty standard of

41

125.

126.

127.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

‘adequate and effective compensation’ since Article 5 itself specifies that such compensation
‘shall amount to the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the
expropriation’ [emphasis added]. Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the taking was
not discriminatory. The whole of the oil support business on Lake Maracaibo was nationalised,
affecting numerous other companies. They submit that the Reserve Law did provide for
compensation. From the earliest stage after 8 May 2009, Respondent claims the Government
had made clear to Claimants that it was prepared to compensate Claimants, but only on the basis
of a global settlement. It was Claimants that had not accepted that offer and elected to proceed

instead to arbitration.

Claimants submit that, if the expropriation is unlawful, they are entitled, as a matter of the
international law of State responsibility, to additional compensation, in the event that the
property that is the subject of the illicit taking has increased in value since the date of the State
measure.”°° Respondent, on the other hand, while insisting that the expropriation was lawful,
also submits that the date for valuation prescribed in the Treaty is applicable in any event,

whether the expropriation was lawful or unlawful.?°°

The Tribunal will consider first (i) the question of whether the taking in the present case was non-
discriminatory; and then (ii) the relevance and application of the compensation standard in the

determination of the lawfulness of the expropriation.

(i) Non-discrimination

In order to be lawful, a State taking of property must be non-discriminatory. The Tribunal has
carefully considered the evidence relied upon by Claimants in support of their allegation that, in
the present case, Respondent did discriminate against Claimants in the application of the
Reserve Law.”"° It finds that none of the instances of alleged different treatment of other

contractors in fact constitutes discrimination against Claimants:

(a) In the case of services provided by Gulmar Offshore, the unchallenged evidence of Mr. Figuera
was that its vessels were originally seized, but then released once it was established that they

were foreign-flagged and foreign-crewed — a like treatment to that accorded to the foreign-

flagged vessels of Tidewater affiliates; and that Gulmar in any event no longer provides services

on Lake Maracaibo and is pursuing a claim in arbitration against PDVSA.?"*

(b) In the case of Servipica, its services were provided off shore and were not covered by the

Reserve Law.

(c) In the case of Astivenca, its services on Lake Maracaibo were indeed expropriated under

Ministerial Resolution No 51.7%

The Tribunal therefore finds that the expropriation was not discriminatory against Claimants. It
is therefore necessary to assess the relevance of the non-payment of compensation to the

lawfulness or otherwise of Respondent’s taking.

(ii) Compensation

Both Parties rely upon the foundational decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice
(PCIJ or Permanent Court) in Chorzéw Factory.” In that decision, the Permanent Court first
explained the difference between an expropriation that has to be considered lawful on the
condition that a fair compensation is granted or will be granted — possibly by a tribunal — and an
expropriation that is illegal per se. Once such distinction has been clarified, the PCIJ presented
‘the guiding principles according to which the amount of compensation due may be
determined’ ?"* and explained that the compensation was not to be the same under both

situations.

The Court begins by elucidating a distinction between a lawful expropriation and an unlawful

one:

The action of Poland which the Court has judged to be contrary to the Geneva Convention is not
an expropriation — to render which lawful only the payment of fair compensation would have
been wanting; it is a seizure of property, rights and interests which could not be expropriated

even against compensation....245

24 Ibid, 46.

215 Idem.

43

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

Here the Court is stating expressly that illegality must stem from a circumstance beyond the

mere absence of compensation.

131. After h

expropr

aving posited the distinction between a lawful expropriation and an unlawful

iation, the Court explains that the two situations do not entail the same level of

compensation:

It follows that the compensation due to the German government is not necessarily limited to the
value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to the date of payment.
This limitation would only be admissible if the Polish Government had had the right to expropriate,
and if the wrongful act consisted merely in not having paid to the two Companies the just price

of what was expropriated; in the present case, such a limitation .... would be tantamount to

 

rendering lawful liquidation and unlawful dispossession indistinguishable in so far as their

financial results are concerned.”4°

132. Having thus stated that lawful and unlawful expropriation must not bear the same financial

consequences, the Permanent Court lays down the standard of compensation for unlawful

expropriations:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act ... is that reparation must,
as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation
which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in
kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution
in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be
covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles which should

serve to determine the amount of compensation for an act contrary to international law.2”

133. The Iran—-US Claims Tribunal in the Amoco case confirmed that the level of compensation

depended on the legal qualification of the expropriation:

[T]he Tribunal holds that the question of the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the expropriation has

a direct bearing on the issue of compensation...

26 Ibid, 47.

217 Idem.

134.

135.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

Undoubtedly, the first principle established by the Court is that a clear distinction must be made
between lawful and unlawful expropriation, since the rules applicable to the compensation to

be paid by the expropriating State differ according to the legal characterization of the taking.2#®

The Iran-US Claims Tribunal found that ‘the compensation to be paid in case of a lawful
expropriation (or of a taking which lacks only the payment of a fair compensation to be lawful)
is limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession’.”1° It elucidated the
distinction in the standard of compensation between a lawful and an unlawful expropriation in

the following way:

193. According to the Court in Chorzéw Factory, an obligation of reparation of all the damages
sustained by the owner of expropriated property arises from an unlawful expropriation. The rules
of international law relating to international responsibility of States apply in such a case. They
provide for restitutio in integrum: restitution in kind or, if impossible, its monetary equivalent. If
need be, "damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution" should also be
awarded. See Chorzdw Factory, supra, at 47. On the other hand, a lawful expropriation must give
rise to "the payment of fair compensation," id. at 46, or of "the just price of what was
expropriated." /d. at 47. Such an obligation is imposed by a specific rule of the international law

of expropriation.
More recent investment arbitral practice also supports the same approach. In Santa Elena, the
Tribunal determined compensation at the date of the taking on the basis that the expropriation
was lawful, even though no compensation had been paid for many years.””° In Goetz v Burundi,
the Tribunal held that, all other conditions for a lawful taking having been met, the failure to pay
prompt and adequate compensation did not suffice ‘to taint this measure as illegal under
international law’.221 In Mondev v USA, the Tribunal considered that, in order to render the
expropriation lawful under the treaty (NAFTA) all that was required was that ‘the obligation to

compensate must be recognised by the taking State at the time of the taking, or a procedure

%8 Amoco (CL-148), [86], [192], citations omitted. The same approach is adopted by the ECtHR:
Papamichalopoulos v Greece, [36]: ‘The act of the Greek Government ... contrary to the Convention was
not an expropriation that would have been legitimate but for the failure to pay fair compensation ... The
unlawfulness of such a dispossession inevitably affects the criteria to be used for determining the
reparation owed by the respondent State, since the pecuniary consequences of a lawful expropriation
cannot be assimilated to those of an unlawful dispossession.’

must exist at that time which the claimant may effectively and promptly invoke in order to

ensure compensation’ .22

Scholars also have insisted on the necessity to distinguish expropriation illegal per se and
expropriation only wanting compensation to be considered legal. If an expropriation were to be
considered illegal as soon as no compensation is granted, then the consequence, according to

Salacuse would be that

... in cases in which an expropriation meets all the conditions for a legal expropriation except for
a determination of the tribunal that the host State had not paid market value for the property
expropriated such an expropriation would have to be considered ‘illegal’ and compensation
would therefore be awarded not on the basis of the valuation standard in the Treaty but on the
basis of the Chorzéw Factory principle and customary international law. It is suggested that such
a result would not accord with the intention of the contracting Parties as evidenced by the Treaty

text.223

Walde and Sabahi point out that the inclusion in bilateral investment treaties of specific language
regarding the standard of compensation for expropriation has the consequence that ‘nearly
every expropriation dispute will be adjudicated not under customary international law, but
under specific binding treaty language’ .?” Ripinsky and Williams state that ‘a good faith offering
of, or provision for, compensation (even if not in a sufficient amount, as long as not manifestly

unreasonable) should render the expropriation lawful.’?2°Marboe concludes:

While earlier the mere ‘promise’ of a State to pay any sum at any time was not enough for the
lawfulness of an expropriation, today there seems to be consensus that it is sufficient, if a State,
at the time of the expropriation, offers compensation or provides for the determination of

compensation... One may, therefore, conclude that according to arbitral practice and scholarly

22 MMondev v USA (CL-046), [71]. Cf. the position where the State makes no offer of compensation at all
(as in Wena v Egypt (CL-141), [100]; Vivendi v Argentina (Resubmission) (CL-138) or offers an amount that
is so negligible as not to be in made in good faith (as in Rumeli v Kazakhstan (CL-95)).

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

writing, the mere existence of a dispute about the amount of compensation does not render the

expropriation unlawful.226
Most expropriation claims turn on the question whether a measure is expropriatory at all. In
such cases, where the tribunal finds expropriation, compensation is almost always due. Cases
where expropriation is acknowledged and the dispute revolves around the proper amount of
compensation are rare; cases where no compensation has been paid because the label of
expropriation itself is contested are the norm. That means that almost every decision finding
expropriation would also find unlawful expropriation — and almost every tribunal would then set
aside the ‘fair market value at the time of expropriation’ standard for compensation for
expropriation. Such an approach thus would make a detailed and elaborate element of the
expropriation provision in modern BITs, including the provisions of Article 5 of the Venezuela-

Barbados BIT, effectively nugatory.

The Tribunal’s approach is also consistent with the World Bank Guidelines.””” The Guidelines
‘may be applied by members of the World Bank Group institutions to private foreign investment
in their respective territories, as a complement to applicable bilateral and multilateral treaties’
(to the extent that there is no conflict between them).?”° Part IV deals with expropriation. It
prohibits expropriation or measures having similar effects ‘except where this is done in
accordance with applicable legal procedures, in pursuance in good faith of a public purpose,
without discrimination on the basis of nationality and against the payment of appropriate
compensation’. 7° Compensation is deemed appropriate ‘if it is adequate, effective and
prompt’.?°° Compensation is deemed adequate ‘if it is based on the fair market value of the taken
asset as such value is determined immediately before the time at which the taking occurred or

the decision to take the asset became publicly known’.”** Determination of such fair market

value is acceptable if conducted on a basis agreed between the State and the foreign investor

‘or by a tribunal or another body designated by the Parties’.?>?

The Guidelines thus reinforce the conclusion of the Tribunal that an expropriation wanting only
a determination of compensation by an international tribunal is not to be treated as an illegal
expropriation. They prescribe a standard for compensation that is identical to that required
under Article 5 of the BIT in the present case and then provide that the amount of such
compensation will be acceptable if determined ‘by a tribunal ... designated by the Parties.’ It
follows that such a tribunal must have an opportunity to make its determination as to
compensation. Where such a tribunal has done so (and assuming that the other conditions are

met) the expropriation will not be illegal.

The Tribunal concludes that a distinction has to be made between a lawful expropriation and an
unlawful expropriation. An expropriation only wanting fair compensation has to be considered
as a provisionally lawful expropriation, precisely because the tribunal dealing with the case will

determine and award such compensation.

The essential difference between the two is that compensation for a lawful expropriation is fair
compensation represented by the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession and
reparation in case of unlawful expropriation is restitution in kind or its monetary equivalent. The
precise manner in which, in the modern context, the standard of fair value at the date of
dispossession is to be applied will have to be considered in greater depth in Part B of the

Tribunal’s analysis.

In the present case, the State did not seek to expropriate the assets without compensation. But
Claimants submit that the taking is to be treated as illegal, since the Reserve Law mandates a
level of compensation that is limited to the book value of the assets and it prohibits the taking
into account of lost profits or indirect damages.” This, Claimants argue, is inconsistent with the

standard of compensation required by Article 5 of the BIT and thus illegal.734

The Tribunal observes that Article 5 defines the compensation payable for expropriation simply
as ‘the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation’. It

does not prescribe how that market value is to be determined. That valuation is a matter that

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

both Venezuela and Barbados, as contracting Parties to the BIT, entrusted to this Tribunal by
virtue of the consent to arbitration in Article 8 of the Treaty. Article 8(3) confirms that the arbitral
award may determine, in case of a dispute relating to an expropriation, ‘the amount of the
compensation.’ Thus, to use the language of the World Bank Guidelines, the present Tribunal is

a ‘tribunal ... designated by the Parties’ to determine the acceptable level of compensation.

As will be seen in Part B of the Tribunal’s analysis, the Treaty standard of ‘market value’ does not
denote a particular method of valuation. The appropriate method of valuation will depend upon
the context. In some cases, the appropriate valuation may indeed be the book value of the
assets.”*° By virtue of the terms of the BIT and the consent to the determination of valuation by
this Tribunal accorded by Venezuela thereunder, this Tribunal is not limited by the limits on
valuation imposed by the Reserve Law. But this Tribunal is not disposed to find that the valuation
limits in Article 6 of the Reserve Law are of such a character as to render the expropriation as a
whole illegal. This is not a case where the State took assets without any offer of compensation.
The record does not demonstrate a refusal on the part of the State to pay compensation. Rather,
it discloses that the Parties were unable to agree on the basis or the process by which such
compensation would be calculated and paid.”*° This is therefore a task that they have submitted

to this Tribunal.

For present purposes, it suffices to conclude that the present expropriation was lawful, since it
wants only compensation, a matter vouchsafed by the Parties to this Tribunal to determine

according to the standards prescribed in the BIT.3”

2. Other Causes of Action

In essence both Parties argued this case as a claim of compensation for expropriation. In the
Tribunal’s view, this is the correct approach. The gravamen of Claimants’ complaint is that
Respondent took their property, being their investment in SEMARCA by means of the State

measures that the Tribunal has just analysed in the preceding section. The real questions for the

237 The present case is therefore to be distinguished from the position in ADC v Hungary, CL-107, where
the tribunal found that the expropriation violated the four criteria mentioned in the BIT: it was not made
in furtherance of a public interest, it was not made according to due process of law, it was discriminatory
and no just compensation was provided.

Tribunal are as to the legality of such taking and the amount of compensation due in respect of

it.

In their Request for Arbitration, Claimants added claims for breach of the Treaty standards of fair
and equitable treatment, for the taking of arbitrary or discriminatory measures and the failure
to accord Claimants’ investments the same treatment as that accorded to nationals of Venezuela

or third States.

The Tribunal has already considered and rejected the allegation that Venezuela’s measures were
discriminatory in the context of its discussion of the legality of the taking. The additional causes
of action for the taking of discriminatory measures or of a failure in national or most favoured

nation treatment do not add anything in the light of that finding.

The claim of failure of fair and equitable treatment is, in the Tribunal’s view, simply inapposite
in the present case in which the real focus of the claim is not on the procedural fairness of
Respondent's treatment of Claimants, but on its taking of their property. Considering the case
through the prism of a claim of fair and equitable treatment does not add anything to the
Tribunal’s consideration of the questions of liability or the quantum of damage. Claimants rely
on the same measures for this claim??* and do not assert that a different measure of damage is
applicable. Accordingly, the Tribunal leaves aside the other alleged causes of action and proceeds

to analyse the level of compensation to be awarded for the principal claim of expropriation.

B Compensation

1. Standard of compensation
Once the distinction between lawful and unlawful expropriation is accepted, such distinction has
to be translated into a workable standard, applicable to the case before the Tribunal, which is
one of lawful expropriation. Here, the starting point is the standard enunciated in Article 5 of the
Treaty itself, namely ‘the market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the

expropriation’.

In the Tribunal’s view, the World Bank Guidelines provide reasonable guidance as to the content
of the standard chosen by the States Parties to the BIT as the standard of compensation to be

applied in cases of lawful compensation, where the investment constituted a going concern at

238 Memorial, [90].

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

the time of the taking. The Guidelines prescribe ‘the fair market value of the taken asset as such
value is determined immediately before the time at which the taking occurred’.*9 Such standard
is also consistent with the standard of fair compensation required by customary international

law in the case of a lawful expropriation.”°

The International Law Commission has noted that this approach has been widely adopted by

international tribunals, in the case of the nationalisation of a going concern:

Decisions of various ad hoc tribunals since 1945 have been dominated by claims in respect of
nationalized business entities. The preferred approach in these cases has been to examine the
assets of the business, making allowance for goodwill and profitability as appropriate. This
method has the advantage of grounding compensation as much as possible in some objective
assessment of value linked to the tangible asset backing of the business. The value of goodwill
and other indicators of profitability may be uncertain, unless derived from information provided
by a recent sale or acceptable arms-length offer. Yet, for profitable business entities where the
whole is greater than the sum of the parts, compensation would be incomplete without paying

due regard to such factors.?#2

Absent agreement of the Parties, the Guidelines define the fair market value as to be determined
‘according to reasonable criteria related to the market value of the investment, i.e., in an amount
that a willing buyer would normally pay to a willing seller after taking into account the nature of
the investment, the circumstances in which it would operate in the future and its specific
characteristics, including the period in which it has been in existence, the proportion of tangible
assets in the total investment and other relevant factors pertinent to the specific circumstances

of each case’.

Whilst making plain that there is no exclusive validity of a single standard, the Guidelines provide
for a distinction to be drawn between ‘a going concern with a proven record of profitability’ and

other enterprises and assets not having this characteristic. Where the enterprise meets this

criterion, the Guidelines indicate that compensation will be reasonable if determined ‘on the

basis of the discounted cash flow value’.

In the field of investment treaty law, tribunals have frequently found the discounted cash flow
(DCF) method to provide the most useful method for arriving at a valuation of a business that
had been operating as a going concern prior to the taking. In CMS v Argentina, the tribunal
endorsed the application of the DCF method in that case, which involved a going concern. It
found this to be an ‘appropriate method for valuing business assets ... [where] there is adequate
data to make a rational DCF valuation’.2“ In Enron, the tribunal held that ‘there is convincing
evidence that DCF is a sound tool used internationally to value companies, albeit that it is to be

used with caution as it can give rise to speculation’.7°
A going concern is defined in the World Bank Guidelines as meaning:

[Aln enterprise consisting of income-producing assets which has been in operation for a sufficient
period of time to generate the data required for the calculation of future income and which could
have been expected with reasonable certainty, if the taking had not occurred, to continue
producing legitimate income over the course of its economic life in the general circumstances

following the taking by the State.#°

Discounted cash flow is defined as meaning:
[T]he cash receipts realistically expected from the enterprise in each future year of its economic
life as reasonably projected minus that year’s expected cash expenditure, after discounting this
net cash flow for each year by a factor which reflects the time value of money, expected inflation,
and the risk associated with such cash flow under realistic circumstances. Such discount rate may
be measured by examining the rate of return available in the same market on alternative

investments of comparable risk on the basis of their present value.”"”

2. Date of valuation

As the Tribunal has already found that it is to apply the Treaty standard of compensation for
expropriation, the question of the appropriate date to be taken for valuation may be dealt with
rather more shortly. Article 5 itself prescribes that what is to be determined is ‘the market value
of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation’. In other words, the
question is what a willing buyer would have paid a willing seller for the expropriated investment

at that time.

This type of valuation has been commonly referred to in shorthand as an ex ante valuation,
because it seeks to determine the value of the investment before the expropriatory measure.
But it is important to be clear that this does not mean that the valuation is unconcerned with

future prospects:

(a) In the first place, as the World Bank Guidelines themselves confirm, the factors that a willing
buyer would itself take into account on the purchase of such an investment necessarily include

‘the circumstances in which it would operate in the future’.

(b) In the second place, the Tribunal is not required to shut its eyes to events subsequent to the
date of injury, if these shed light in more concrete terms on the value applicable at the date of

injury or validate the reasonableness of a valuation made at that date.”

This second qualification, however, does not change the actual date of valuation. The purpose
of referring to subsequent events is not to present a hypothetical business that never in fact
occurred and would not reasonably have been taken into account by a willing buyer prior to
expropriation. Rather, it is permitted in cases where such events shed more light in concrete
terms on the value of the investment prior to expropriation. In assessing the value of the
business at that date, the Tribunal disregards business prospects that it considers to be too

remote or speculative to justify inclusion.

In the present case, both experts agree that ‘the ex post approach should only be used if
hindsight allows for a reliable measurement of lost cash flows between the date of breach and a

present date’.”“° There may in particular cases be a real benefit in hindsight. For the reasons

already developed, the present case is not one of an illegal expropriation and so the Tribunal is
not required to determine the content of the requisite standard of compensation required by
international law by way of restitution in such a case. The Tribunal is mindful, as the International
Law Commission has said, of the need to guard against ‘the risk of double-counting which arises
from the relationship between the capital value of an enterprise and its contractually based

profits’.25°

In the present case, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to delve in detail into the case advanced
by Claimants as to SEMARCA’s alleged future prospects in support of deep-water oil exploration
in Venezuela. Substantial time was spent on this aspect of the claim in the expert reports on
quantum and in cross-examination at the hearing. The Tribunal considers that this projected
future business is too remote from SEMARCA’s established support business in Lake Maracaibo
and the Gulf of Paria and too speculative to be reasonably capable of inclusion in an assessment
of loss in any event. This is borne out by the fact that, when an opportunity did arise to support
Chevron’s drilling programme in the Cardén III block (a program that Chevron abandoned in June
2009 when the well that it had drilled was dry), Tidewater supported this by supplying US-flagged

and crewed vessels direct from the United States.

3. Appropriate method for assessment of fair market value

Although it is for the Claimants to prove that they have suffered some damage in order to be
awarded compensation, it is for the Tribunal itself to determine the amount of compensation.?5+
This is necessarily a matter of the Tribunal’s informed estimation in the light of all the evidence

available to it.?5*

The Tribunal considers that in the present case, it is appropriate to determine the fair market

value of Claimants’ investment in SEMARCA by reference to a discounted cash flow analysis for

250 International Law Commission ‘Responsibilities of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts: Text of the
Draft Articles with Commentaries thereto’ [2001] 2(2) YB ILC, Article 36(26).

251 Sapphire International, 187-8; SPP v Egypt (RL-113), 215. Thus, in Chorzéw Factory, the Permanent
Court found that the two German companies had suffered some damage as a result of the illegal act of
the Polish Government in dispossessing them of the Factory at Chorzéw (Chorzéw Factory, 46). It then
took up itself the task of determining the quantum of that damage, by appointing its own experts to
conduct an enquiry: Ibid, 51 and Order (Expert Enquiry): (1928) PCU Ser. A No 17, 99-103.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

the following reasons: (a) SEMARCA was, immediately prior to the date of the taking, a going
concern with a proven track record of profitability; (b) it had been operating successfully in
Venezuela for some fifty years, and (c) in the five years prior to the taking, it had recorded
substantial operating income as recorded in its income statements.” Thus, in the Tribunal’s
view, it is not appropriate to determine the fair market value by reference to either the
liquidation value of the assets of the SEMARCA Enterprise, or the book value of those assets, as
Respondent contends.”°* Such methods would likely only be appropriate, as the World Bank

Guidelines point out, where the enterprise was not a proven going concern.?°°

However, the valuation of Claimants’ investment in SEMARCA as a going concern does present
particular difficulties in view of the character of SEMARCA’s business. SEMARCA was not a
publicly listed company and its business was limited to one country and one customer. The
Tribunal is not persuaded that the other transactions and companies referenced by Claimants’
experts in their reports”® are sufficiently comparable to SEMARCA’s business, and to the market
in which it operated, so as to assist it in arriving at a fair market value of SEMARCA. It accepts
the views of Respondent’s experts that the differences between the business contexts in which

such other companies were operating are simply too great for them to be comparable.?5”

The consequence is that the Tribunal must approach the valuation of SEMARCA based upon the
factors that are specific to its business. However, even when examined on this basis alone, the
ex ante valuations prepared by the Parties’ experts differed greatly. In his written reports,
Claimants’ expert arrived at an ex ante valuation of US$81.68 million (excluding interest).7°* By

contrast, Respondent's experts, in their second report, arrived at a valuation of US$2.9 million.75°

The reasons for the these great differences in valuation are to be found in a number of specific
variables adopted by the experts on the basis of assumptions that they respectively made, either
on the basis of their instructions from counsel or in their own opinion. It is therefore necessary

for the Tribunal to make its own findings as to each of the material elements in the DCF analysis

on the basis of the evidence before it. Once this has been done, it will be possible to apply the
assumptions that the Tribunal has determined to be applicable to the DCF analysis in order to
assist in arriving at an appropriate figure. At the Tribunal’s request during the course of the
hearing, the experts for both Parties prepared illustrative tables showing the effect of different
assumptions upon their calculations, which have greatly assisted the Tribunal in this part of its

work.

4. Elements in DCF valuation analysis

There are six variables adopted in the experts’ reports that have a material effect on the

valuation of Claimants’ investment in SEMARCA:

a

Scope of business: Whether SEMARCA’s business is assumed to be limited to its operations
on Lake Maracaibo, or whether one adds operations existing in 2009 outside Lake Maracaibo
(and, if so, whether one includes services provided to international oil companies or only to

PDVSA and its subsidiaries);

b

Accounts receivable: Whether the outstanding accounts receivable from PDVSA are to be

included in the value of the company at the valuation date or excluded from it;

¢)

Historical cash-flow: Whether to include the whole period from 2006 to March 2009 or to
exclude 2009 (on the basis that the cash flow is disproportionately high in comparison to

earlier years);

d

Equity risk: Whether to apply an equity risk premium at 5% or 6.5%;

e

Country risk: Whether to apply a country risk of 1.5% (Claimants’ expert) or 14.75%

(Respondent’s experts);

f) Business risk: Whether to make an adjustment for single customer concentration at an

assumed rate of 25% per annum or no such adjustment.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

(a) Scope of business

SEMARCA’s business was primarily concerned with supplying support to PDVSA’s oil operations
on Lake Maracaibo. As at the valuation date of 7 May 2009, this business was conducted using
11 vessels. The business was a mature one. It had been conducted successfully and profitably
over many years. Equally, Claimants and their expert did not seek to suggest that the business
on Lake Maracaibo presented real opportunities for expansion. The oil field on Lake Maracaibo,
though containing extensive reserves, is a mature oil field. There were numerous other private

operators providing support services to PDVSA.

However, in addition, SEMARCA was then under contract to support two further oil projects,
both of which were carried out off shore. In the first place, SEMARCA was supporting PetroSucre,
a PDVSA affiliate, in its operations at Corocoro in the Gulf of Paria with four vessels. The Tribunal
has already found on the evidence that these were treated by PDVSA as being covered by the
Reserve Law and were seized on 12 July 2009. They had historically formed part of SEMARCA’s
fleet based at La Cafiada on Lake Maracaibo. The value of the business represented by the
operations of these vessels must therefore be added to the 11 vessels actually stationed on Lake

Maracaibo.

The position is different, however, in respect of the business represented by the two vessels, the
President Tide and the High Quest, that were contracted to support Chevron in its exploratory
drilling project in the Cardén III block. These vessels were not part of SEMARCA’s ordinary fleet.
They were registered under a United States flag”*! and were crewed by United States citizens.?°
The contract with Chevron came to an end in June 2009, when Chevron’s drilling operations
produced a dry well and Chevron abandoned the Cardon III block. The Tribunal considers that
this contract cannot be treated as an ordinary part of SEMARCA’s operations for the purpose of
valuing its business as a going concern. It was out of the ordinary course of SEMARCA’s business.
and did not continue. It was not organized or staffed on the same basis as the rest of SEMARCA’s

operations.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides to exclude the business represented by these two vessels from
the cash flow of the business for the purpose of calculating its value. The result is that the
business is to be treated as having an assumed scope, based upon its historical operations,

represented by the cash flow generated by 15 vessels.

(b) Accounts receivable

The second element that led to differences in the respective experts’ valuations was the
treatment of accounts receivable. It is common ground that there was, as at 7 May 2009, a large
amount (some US$44,888,040) of accounts receivable from PDVSA/PetroSucre recorded in the
accounts of SEMARCA.?°? Claimants’ expert included these sums in valuing the company, making
adjustments to ensure that they did not distort the cash flow of the business on an ongoing
basis. Respondent's experts, on the other hand, had been instructed by counsel not to include
accounts receivable in any of their valuations.”° The experts justified this exclusion on the basis
that the accounts receivable had not been expropriated, because SEMARCA still exists as a
company and is therefore entitled to collect its receivables.”© Its effect on Respondent's experts’
DCF valuation was considerable. Respondent’s experts excluded all accounts receivable and
other working capital from their DCF analysis. This produced a negative free cash flow to equity
and a negative discounted cash flow of US$2.433 million in FY2010, 7°” with consequential effects

on subsequent years.

The Tribunal has already found, on the basis of the contemporaneous record, including the
decisions of the Venezuelan Courts themselves, that Respondent expropriated the SEMARCA
Enterprise as a whole, by assuming control in fact of its business and all of its assets. Thus, the

investment that was lost must include outstanding unpaid accounts receivable.

For the purpose of valuation of the business as a going concern on the date immediately prior to
the expropriation, the accounts receivable must be included. They constitute a valuable asset of

the business. The Tribunal is satisfied that a willing buyer would so regard them. In the light of

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

the long history of successful dealings between SEMARCA and PDVSA, these sums, which
represent an accrued debt on contracts already performed, would be treated as fully recoverable.
There was some evidence presented at the jurisdiction stage that PDVSA wished to negotiate
discounts on its outstanding debts with its major suppliers in early 2009,7 but SEMARCA’s
position had been that it needed to be paid in full. In the merits phase, Respondent’s position is
that ‘the principal asset of the company, its accounts receivable, was not taken, and Claimants

remain free to pursue collection of any outstanding accounts under the relevant contracts’ .?°

For these reasons, the Tribunal decides to include SEMARCA’s outstanding accounts receivable

as at 7 May 2009 in determining the value to be ascribed to the business.

(c) Cash flow

The third element that contributed to the differences in the valuations of the Parties’ respective
experts is the question whether the cash flow of SEMARCA for the year ended 31 March 2009
should be included in the determination of the historical cash flows of the company. Both experts
start their calculation of historical cash flows in FY2006. Claimants’ expert includes the results
for FY2009. Respondent’s experts exclude them on the basis that FY2009 was an exceptional
year in terms of profitability.?”° They therefore work on an average of historical cash flows for

the three years ended FY2008.

The Tribunal considers it proper to include the results of all four years for which historical cash
flow data is presented. A willing buyer of SEMARCA in May 2009 would have taken into account
all of the available current financial data on the cash flows of the company. Although the rates
commanded in FY2009 were higher than in the previous years, the oil industry is notoriously
price volatile. The higher prices in 2009 also in part reflected higher labour costs.?” Taking an
average of all four years of historical cash flow seems to the Tribunal to reflect most fairly the

available information.

(d) Equity risk premium

A fourth material element in the discounted cash flow analysis that led to material differences
between the experts is the percentage premium to be applied to the risk involved in investing in
equities rather than risk-free US Treasury bonds. Claimants’ expert maintains that 5% is a
reasonable estimate. Respondent’s experts apply a rate of 6.5%. They opine that this represents
the most reliable long term arithmetical mean of equity risk premia in the relevant industry and
that Claimants’ expert had applied a percentage that was not supported by the most reliable

primary data.

The Tribunal has carefully examined the primary data available to it in the form in which it was
exhibited to the experts’ reports. It finds particularly salient three primary sources of long-term
equity risk premia: the Ibbotson-Morningstar Report (which covers the period 1926-2009),?””
the Damodaran Report (which covers the period 1928-2009), 77? and the Dimson-Marsh-
Staunton Report (which covers the period 1900-2009).?” These report a long-term market risk
premium, as at 2009 of between 6.0% and 6.7%.?”° Thus the Tribunal concludes that it is

reasonable to include an equity risk premium of 6.5% in the calculation of the cost of capital.

(e) Country risk premium

An element of greatest difference between the approaches of the experts is the premium to be
applied to the risk of investing in a particular country, here Venezuela. Claimants’ expert adopted

acountry risk premium of 1.5%, while Respondent’s experts adopted 14.75%.

Claimants’ expert, Mr. Kaczmarek, accepted in answer to a question from a member of the
Tribunal that Venezuela ‘quite possibly is one of the highest risk countries’ in the world in which
to invest.?”° The reason why his country risk premium is so low is that he considers that political

risk ought to be excluded from the country risk premium. This opinion is in turn based upon a

272 BF-23.
273 BF-113.
274 BF-114,

275 The Tribunal has also reviewed the additional papers on equity risk premia exhibited by Claimants’
expert to his Second Report (NAV-388 — NAV-392 & NAV-474 — NAV-475). It finds that these either post-
date the valuation date; do not present a long-term set of data or represent analysts’ various evaluations
rather than primary data.

view about the legal implications of the existence of the investment protections contained in the
Venezuela-Barbados BIT. This, he considers, entitled him to exclude the ‘real risks of the
Government acting in a very negative way towards any private investment’ .?”’ He considers that,
in the light of such protections, to include such risks would confer an illegitimate benefit on the

State:

If the State can create these risks that it controls, threaten businesses, [...] lower the value of the
business, and then they expropriate, if we’re going to take all that risk into account, then they get
to purchase the company at a very steep discount because of their own risks that they have

created hostile towards those companies.?”°

In the Tribunal’s view, Claimants’ expert conflates two separate elements in a legal claim of this
kind. The first element is a question of liability: are the protections of Article 5 of the BIT engaged
by the specific actions of the host State, such that the investor is entitled to be awarded
compensation for the loss of his property? As the Tribunal has already observed, the BIT does
not prohibit all State taking of private property. Rather it requires a taking for a public interest
to be compensated and provides a mechanism by which the appropriate level of compensation
can be awarded by an international tribunal. Doubtless, the Treaty seeks to encourage
investment between the Contracting States. But it is not an insurance policy or guarantee against

all political or other risks associated with such investment.

If the Tribunal finds liability, then, at the second quantum stage, the Tribunal must determine
the ‘market value’ of the investment. This second element in the claim is in essence an economic
question. It depends upon the value that the market would attribute to the investment in
question. Returning to the World Bank Guidelines, this is an amount that a willing buyer would
pay to a willing seller of the investment immediately prior to the taking in question. Where this
is determined by use of a discounted cash flow analysis, the Guidelines specifically invite a

consideration of ‘the risk associated with such cash flow under realistic circumstances’ .””°

This is not a matter of permitting a respondent State to profit from its own wrong. On the
contrary, the damages that the Tribunal is empowered by virtue of the Treaty to award are
designed to ensure that the private investor is compensated for the loss of its investment. But,

in determining the amount of that compensation by reference to a discounted cash flow analysis,

the Tribunal should consider the value that a willing buyer would have placed on the investment.
In determining this value, one element that a buyer would consider is the risk associated with
investing in a particular country. Such a factor is not specific to the particular State measure that
gives rise to the claim. That measure must be left out of account in arriving at a valuation, since,
according to Article 5, the market valuation must be arrived at ‘immediately before the
expropriation or before the impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the
earlier’. Rather the country risk premium quantifies the general risks, including political risks, of
doing business in the particular country, as they applied on that date and as they might then
reasonably have been expected to affect the prospects, and thus the value to be ascribed to the

likely cash flow of the business going forward.

The inclusion of a country risk premium is a very common feature of tribunals’ calculations of
compensation, since, as one tribunal observed ‘the fundamental issue of country risk [is] obvious
to the least sophisticated businessman’.”®° For example, in one recent decision concerning

Venezuela, the tribunal adopted a country risk rate of 18%.?8+

For these reasons, the Tribunal rejects Mr. Kaczmarek’s view as to the appropriate basis on which

to approach country risk.

Respondent'’s experts for their part advanced a country risk premium of 14.75%. This was derived
from the Ibbotson-Morningstar International Cost of Capital Report for 20097* and validated by

comparison with the method adopted by Professor Damodaran.?®?

In the Tribunal’s view, a country risk premium for Venezuela in 2009 of 14.75% represents a
reasonable, indeed conservative, premium. In the light of its rejection of Claimants experts’

reasoning, it adopts this premium for the purpose of its valuation of the investment.

(f) Business risk

The final element that led to material differences in the Parties’ discounted cash flow analyses is
the question of whether any discount should be applied to take account of the risk to the

reduction in SEMARCA’s business over time.

Respondent, supported by the expert evidence of Professor Wells, Emeritus Professor of
International Management at Harvard Business School, argues that SEMARCA’s business was
subject to a significant risk arising from its concentration on a single customer: PDVSA and its
subsidiaries. This risk, it maintains, requires an adjustment to the valuation of the investment at

an assumed rate of reduction of 25% per annum.?**

The Tribunal has considered this risk against the factual evidence that it heard during the hearing.
Mr. Figuera, who in 2009 was General Manager of CVP, the subsidiary of PDVSA responsible for
relations with private contractors, testified vividly as to the size and scale of the oil industry
support services that PDVSA had to call upon on Lake Maracaibo. He concluded that: ‘we
depended up to a point, a significant point, we depended upon contractors’.”*° The Tribunal has
already found that the Respondent enacted the Reserve Law not simply so as to reserve to itself
the oil services support industry on Lake Maracaibo, but also, to that end, to expropriate the

vessels and the business of the private operators in the Lake.

Mr. Figuera was questioned closely by counsel as to the state of PDVSA’s planning before May
2009 to internalise the type of support services then provided by SEMARCA and a number of
other private companies by buying or manufacturing its own vessels and training its own
crews.”°° The Tribunal has carefully considered this evidence. It concludes on the facts that,
although there were some plans for the further development of PDVSA’s own capacity in the
provision of support services,”®” these were not such as to represent a major risk of loss to
SEMARCA’s business. PDVSA was at the time itself operating some support services on the Lake.

As Mr. Figuera testified ‘we have always had a large significant capacity to operate in the lake

[but] that’s not sufficient’.7°° As at 7 May 2009, PDVSA retained a significant dependence on
private operators such as SEMARCA and would have done so, were it not for the Reserve Law

that enabled it to obtain the SEMARCA Enterprise overnight.

Thus, the Tribunal rejects on the facts the analogy repeatedly presented in Professor Wells’
evidence of the loss of his consulting business with the Harvard Institute for International
Development (HIID), closed as a result of a decision of his University in 2000.7*° In 2009, PDVSA
was operating a very large on-going oil extraction business on Lake Maracaibo. The support
services for that business were largely, though not exclusively, provided by private companies.
That was a matter of conscious choice for PDVSA and for Venezuela, which had elected to
nationalise the oil industry itself in 1975, but not the oil services industry that supported it. True
it is that this business was conducted between the private contractors and a single customer
through short-term contracts. But the underlying industry function required a large developed
infrastructure that could not simply be abandoned, if production on Lake Maracaibo were to
continue (in contrast to Harvard University’s decision to call a halt to the activities of HIID once
it was judged not to be appropriate to the University’s work). Nor could such a function be

replaced by internal service provision without a protracted period of internal investment.

Thus, the Tribunal does not consider that a willing buyer, considering the acquisition of this
business prior to the enactment of the Reserve Law on 8 May 2009, would have applied a

discount for the risk of loss of the business to its customer.
(g) Conclusion on DCF calculation

The Tribunal therefore applies the elements that it has found to be appropriate, using the DCF
analysis:
a) A business consisting of the services performed by the 15 vessels that SEMARCA

operated in or from Lake Maracaibo;

b

Including the outstanding accounts receivable, both as an element supporting the
working capital of the ongoing business and as being recoverable in itself;

¢)

Taking the average of the historic cash flows of the business for the four years 2006 —
2009;
d

Applying an equity risk of 6.5%;

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

e) Applying a country risk of 14.75%;

f) But with no additional discount for single customer concentration.

As mentioned above, during the hearing the Tribunal requested the experts to prepare
additional calculations using their existing models including, inter alia, these variables. The
experts prepared additional tables of calculations that they presented to the Tribunal in the
course of the Parties’ closing submissions. These tables have proved of very considerable
assistance to the Tribunal in its deliberations. They produced a significantly greater convergence
in figures than had been the case in the experts’ reports that were filed in the written phase.
Nevertheless, there continue to be material differences in the approach adopted by the experts,

which in turn affect the figures presented.

Accounts receivable: Claimants’ expert extracts the outstanding large amount of accounts
receivable from his calculations. He presents this as an additional sum that would have to be
valued and included as a separate line item. After adjustments, he calculates the total non-
recurring working capital to be added in this way to be US$16,484,677 (from the total due from
PDVSA and PetroSucre as at 8 May 2009 of US$44,888,040).”°° Respondent’s experts present

only the effect of including the accounts receivable as working capital within their calculations.

Scope of business: Claimants’ expert assumes that the total size of SEMARCA’s business in May
2009 includes the two vessels chartered to Chevron, thus presenting figures for either 11 vessels
only (those actually operating on Lake Maracaibo) or 17 vessels. Respondent’s experts limit their
calculations of additional business to 15 vessels. As the Tribunal has already found that it should
exclude the two vessels chartered to Chevron from its analysis, this has the consequence that

the two sets of figures cannot be directly compared.
With these qualifications, the spread of figures presented by the two experts are as follows:

(a) Claimants: US$31.959 million (11 vessels only) (an earnings multiple of 3.79) +
USS16.484 million non-recurring accounts receivable = US$48.443 million;
(b) Respondent: US$27.407 million (15 vessels with 100% recoverability of accounts

receivable).

The Tribunal has already observed that the determination of an appropriate level of
compensation based upon a discounted cash flow analysis of this kind is not and cannot be an

exact science, but is rather a matter of informed estimation. The Tribunal considers that a willing

299 Navigant Answers to Questions, Slide 10.

205.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

buyer would have valued the business at approximately US$30 million, but that it would also
have been prepared to pay an additional amount of US$16.4 million for the non-recurring
accounts receivable, which it would have been entitled to recover in full from PDVSA upon
acquisition of the business. The Tribunal therefore arrives at a valuation (excluding pre-award

interest) for the purposes of compensation of US$46.4 million.

c Interest

The Parties do not dispute the payment of interest in principle. Rather, they differ as to (i) the
rate at which interest should be calculated; and (ii) whether it should be simple or compound

interest.

Article 5 of the BIT, which the Tribunal has found to be applicable to its determination of
compensation generally, mandates the payment of interest ‘at a normal commercial rate until
the date of payment.’ The Parties accept that this is the applicable starting point,?°! but do not

agree on how such a rate is to be determined.

Claimants’ first proposed rate was the yield on Venezuela’s sovereign bonds in US dollars, which
averaged 13.4% over the period.”°? This they proposed on the basis of an argument that
Claimants had, as a result of the expropriation, effectively become unwilling creditors of the
Respondent and should be compensated at the same rate that the Respondent must pay to
willing lenders. In the Tribunal’s view, this approach mistakes the reason why pre-award interest
is commonly included in a calculation of compensation in a case such as the present. Interest in
such a case simply aims to compensate the claimant from being kept out of its money between
the date on which it ought to have been compensated and the date of payment of an enforceable
award. Such compensation is not punitive of the Respondent. Rather, as the Treaty’s reference
to ‘normal commercial rate’ underlines, it represents the cost of borrowing the sum that the
claimant ought to have received over the same period of time. Thus, the appropriate reference
point is the cost of borrowing available to Claimants, not the amount that Respondent would

have had to pay.

ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5 Tidewater v. Venezuela

Respondent proposes the yield on three-month Treasury bonds plus 1.33%, equivalent to an
annual rate of 1.43%.7°? But, as Claimants point out, this rate does not qualify as a commercial
rate since it is the equivalent of an inter-bank rate, rather than a commercial rate available to a

trading company from is bankers.

Claimants propose in the alternative either US prime + 2% or LIBOR + 4%. In each case, over the
period 8 May 2009 to 31 March 2013, these both averaged 5.2%."* Their expert also points out
that Tidewater itself, the parent company, was able to borrow at rates between 4.35% and 4.47%

over the pre-award interest rate period.°° The Tribunal considers that an interest rate of 4.5%

 

most closely meets the standard agreed between Venezuela and Barbados in Article 5 of the BIT.

The second issue on which the Parties are in dispute is whether interest ought to be awarded on
a simple or compound basis. Claimants submit that ‘the prevailing practice of international
tribunals’?% is to award compound interest. Respondent argues that simple interest is called for

on the basis of both Venezuelan and international law authorities.”*”

In the Tribunal’s view, the basis on which interest is to be calculated in the present case flows
from the specific language of Article 5 of the BIT, which requires a ‘normal commercial rate.’ This
is the rate at which the Claimants could themselves have borrowed the same sum. Since a
commercial bank will typically compound interest due and unpaid on a quarterly basis, the

Tribunal considers that its award of interest ought to be so compounded.?°*

D Costs

Finally, the Tribunal turns to the award of costs in the arbitration. In accordance with Article 61
of the ICSID Convention it is obliged to determine how and by whom the costs of and associated

with these proceedings are to be borne, as to which it retains a wide discretion.

On 11 July 2014, pursuant to a direction given by the President at the conclusion of the hearing

and agreed by counsel for each of the Parties, each Party filed with the Tribunal a Statement of

Costs. Each Party has paid its portion of the advance on the administrative fees and expenses

requested by the Centre, amounting in each case to US$450,000. In addition:

(a) Claimants seek reimbursement of the fees of counsel and experts amounting to
USS7,534,361.33 plus expenses of US$177,739.31;
(b) Respondent seeks reimbursement of the fees of counsel and experts amounting to

USS8,479,879 plus expenses of US$520,538.00.

The Tribunal recalls that it reserved the costs occasioned by its Decision on Jurisdiction.°° At
that stage, each Party prevailed on one of the two grounds of jurisdiction that had originally been
asserted. Each of those bases of challenge to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction was substantial and
properly required the Tribunal’s consideration and determination. The Tribunal’s Decision
resulted in the claims of a number of the original claimants falling outside its jurisdiction. But the
claims of the present Claimants under the Barbados BIT were held to be within its jurisdiction.
Therefore, as regards the costs of and occasioned by the hearing of Respondent’s objection to
jurisdiction, the Tribunal holds that each Party must bear equally its share of the administrative

fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and of the Centre and bear its own costs.

The position is different so far as concerns the merits phase of the proceeding. The Tribunal is
mindful of the fact that the Claimants have overall succeeded in their claim. The result is that
they have been put to a great deal of time, trouble and expense in order to obtain compensation
that Venezuela had vouchsafed to provide under the terms of the Barbados BIT and ought to

have so provided in 2009.

Although the costs that the Parties each claim to have incurred are very large for the scale of the
case, the Tribunal does not consider that either Party caused the other to incur substantial

wasted costs as a result of the manner in which it conducted the proceedings.

On the other hand, the Tribunal notes that the sums that it has in the result awarded to Claimants
are very much less than the US$234 million (including interest) that Claimants sought in the
written phase.*°° In part, this was because Claimants pursued a claim to what it called ‘ex post
damages’, which the Tribunal has rejected on the law. This claim did result in significant wasted

costs in the evidentiary phase, since it required Respondent (and the Tribunal) to consider the

289 Decision on Jurisdiction, [199(7)].

plausibility of various alleged prospects for the expansion of SEMARCA’s deep water support

business in Venezuela in the period after the expropriation.

216. The Tribunal considers therefore that it is prepared to award Claimants a portion of their costs
of the merits phase, but not a full indemnity. In all the circumstances, it considers that a

reasonable portion that Respondent ought to bear is US$2.5 million.

AWARD

For the above reasons, the Tribunal hereby decides that:

(1) Respondent has expropriated Claimants’ investment in SEMARCA without payment of

prompt, adequate and effective compensation;

(2) Claimant is therefore entitled to compensation in accordance with Article 5 of the BIT;

(3) The Tribunal assesses the principal amount of the compensation to be paid as US$46.4

million;

(4) In addition, Claimant is entitled to interest from 8 May 2009 to the date of payment of this

Award at the rate of 4.5% per annum compounded quarterly;

(5) Each Party shall bear its equal share of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal members and
of the Centre, and shall bear its own costs of and occasioned by Respondent's challenge to

the jurisdiction of the Tribunal;

(6) Respondent shall pay to Claimants the sum of US$2.5 million in partial reimbursement of

Claimants’ costs of and occasioned by the merits phase of these proceedings.
