2) The Background of the Dispute

A dispute has arisen between Claimant and Respondent, in respect of which Claimant
commenced arbitration pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of
Poland and the Republic of India for the Promotion and Protection of Investments dated
7 October 1996 (“Treaty” or “India-Poland Treaty”) and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules
1976 (“UNCITRAL Rules”).

The subject matter of this dispute concerns Claimant’s interest, by way of its indirect
shareholding in BH Travel Retail Poland Sp. z 0.0. (“BH Travel”), in certain lease agreements
for retail stores in Warsaw Chopin Airport (“Chopin Airport”). Plans to shut down Terminal 1
of Chopin Airport for a modernisation project led first to negotiations between BH Travel and
the Polish Airports State Enterprise (“PPL”), the State-owned entity managing Chopin Airport,
and then led to the eventual termination of BH Travel’s lease agreements by PPL.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 24 February 2012, Claimant wrote to Respondent providing formal notification of the dispute
and requesting amicable dispute resolution.

' Letter from Counsel for Flemingo DutyFree to the Minister of Transport (S. Nowak) dated 24 February 2012,

if both parties agree, be submitted:

(a) for resolution, in accordance with the law of the Contracting Party which has
admitted the investment to that Contracting Party’s competent judicial or
administrative bodies; or

to international conciliation under the Conciliation Rules of the United Nations
Commission for International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

(b

»

Should the Parties fail to agree on a dispute settlement procedure provided under
paragraph 2 of this article or where a dispute is referred to conciliation but conciliation
proceedings are terminated other than by signing or a settlement agreement, the dispute
may be referred to Arbitration. The Arbitration procedure shall be as follows:

(a) If the Contracting Party of the investor and the other Contracting Party are both
Parties to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of other States, 1965 and the investor consents in writing to submit

such a dispute shalll be referred to the Centre; or

(b

if both parties to the dispute so agree, under the Additional Facility for the
Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings; or

c

to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal by either party to the dispute in accordance with the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade law,

(ii) The Parties shall appoint their respective arbitrators within two months,

(iii) The arbitral award shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement.

(iv) The arbitral tribunal shall state the basis of its decision and give reasons upon
the request of either Party.

10. On5 March 2014, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Article 9(3)(c)(ii) of the
Treaty, Claimant notified Respondent of its appointment of Mr. John M. Townsend, of Hughes
Hubbard & Reed LLP, 1775 I Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20006-2401, U.S.A., as the first
arbitrator.

11. On7 March 2014, pursuant to Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Article 9(3)(c)(ii) of the

? Including Exhibits C-1 to C-

 

Treaty, Respondent appointed Dr. Wolfgang Kiihn, of Heuking Kiihn Liter Wojtek,
Georg-Glock-StraBe 4, 40474 Diisseldorf, Germany, as the second arbitrator.

12. On 3 April 2014, in accordance with Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the co-arbitrators
appointed Professor Hans van Houtte, of Van Houtte Partners BVBA, A. Smetsplein 3D, 3000
Leuven, Belgium, as the presiding arbitrator.

13. On 7 May 2014, following a case management conference held on the same day and having
considered the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, in which it
recorded that the Parties had confirmed the valid constitution of the Tribunal, fixed The Hague
as the place of arbitration, and set out procedural rules as well as a schedule for the proceedings.

14. On8 August 2014, Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim and accompanying documents.’

15. On 7 November 2014, Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence and accompanying
documents.*

16. On 17 November 2014, the Parties each submitted requests for the production of documents by
the other side.

17. On 22 December 2014, the Parties submitted their outstanding document production requests in
the form of completed Redfern Schedules, containing their respective requests and the objections
and replies thereto, to the Tribunal for determination.’ On 16 January 2015, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 2, in which it ordered the production of certain documents to the other
side, subject to the following safeguards for privilege and confidentiality: (i) the Parties shall
produce documents which they claim are confidential only to the other side’s counsel (marked
“for counsel’s eyes only”); and (ii) the Parties shall submit privilege logs regarding the documents
that they have withheld or redacted on the basis of privilege by 13 February 2015. The Tribunal
also granted Claimant the opportunity to reformulate certain of its document production requests
by 23 January 2015.

18. On 23 January 2015, in accordance with Procedural Order No.2, Claimant submitted a
supplemental Redfern Schedule including its reformulated document production requests and an
application that the Tribunal reconsider its decision on another of Claimant’s requests. By letter
dated 28 January 2015, Respondent commented on Claimant’s supplemental Redfern Schedule.
On 29 January 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, in which it decided on
Claimant’s reformulated requests and its application for reconsideration.

19. On 13 February 2015, Respondent submitted a privilege log prepared by PPL dated 12 February
2015. By letter dated 24 February 2014, Respondent asserted that it was unable to produce the
requested documents covered by the privilege log because they were either in PPL’s sole
possession and control or their production depended on PPL’s consent, and because PPL was not
willing to produce or consent to the production of the requested documents. Claimant submitted,

3 Exhibits C-6 to C-127, legal authorities, Exhibits CL-1 to CL-61, witness statements, Exhibits CWS-1 to
CWS-3, and an expert report of Mr. Abdul Sirshar Qureshi of PricewaterhouseCoopers dated 8 Aug. 2014
(“First PWC Report”, Exhibit CER-1).

* Exhibits R-1 to R-116, legal authorities Exhibits RL-1 to RL-25, witness statements, Exhibits RWS-1 to
RWS-2, and an expert report of Deloitte dated 30 October 2014 (“Deloitte Report”, Exhibit RER-1).

5 Claimant submitted Exhibit C-128 and legal authorities, Exhibits CL-62 to CL-66 together with its Reply to
Objections to the Request for Production of Documents dated 22 December 2014.

by letter dated 27 February 2015, that Respondent’s non-production of documents was in
violation of Procedural Order No. 2 and that Respondent should be ordered to produce the
relevant documents immediately, failing which adverse inferences should be drawn against
Respondent in respect of the content of the documents not disclosed.

  

20. Having considered Respondent’s submission of 24 February 2015, and Claimant’s submission of
27 February 2015, the Tribunal decided on 5 March 2015 that: (i) the Tribunal reserves the right
to infer from R dent’s non-production of doct s that such d would be adverse
to Respondent’s interests; (ii) the Claimant may suggest and justify the inferences that it suggests
the Tribunal should draw in its Reply; and (iii) the documents not produced by Respondent for
the reasons stated in its letter dated 24 February 2015 may not be produced at a later stage of the
proceedings. As an alternative, the Tribunal suggested the involvement of an independent expert,
who would be tasked with reviewing the documents and assessing the claims of privilege and
confidentiality.

 

21. On 5 March 2015, Claimant requested the Tribunal to order Respondent to produce a certain
document that Claimant believed was being withheld by Respondent in violation of Procedural
Order No. 2, and requested the Tribunal to confirm that any documents produced “for counsel’s
eyes only” could be shared with the Parties’ experts. On 12 March 2015, Respondent commented
on Claimant’s request.

22. On 12 March 2015, the Parties commented on the Tribunal’s suggestion to involve an
independent expert to resolve the outstanding document production requests. Claimant objected
to the Tribunal’s suggestion, stating that the proposed independent expert procedure would delay
the proceedings and prejudice the preparation of Claimant’s Reply. Respondent submitted that
PPL had not been cooperating in the past and that it could not ensure that PPL would allow the
review of the relevant documents by an independent expert. Having considered the Parties’
positions, the Tribunal decided on 14 March 2015 that no independent expert procedure would
be commenced.

23. By e-mail dated 17 March 2015, the Tribunal dismissed Claimant’s document production request
of 5 March 2015, on the grounds that Respondent had stated that the requested document did not
exist, and the document which Claimant intended to share with its expert did not fall within the
ambit of the expert’s report.

24. On 5 May 2015, Claimant submitted its Reply (Claimant’s Reply) and accompanying
documents.®

25. On 30 July 2015, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder (Respondent’s Rejoinder) and
accompanying documents.’

26. On 20 August 2015, the Parties submitted their respective witness notifications.

 

6 Exhibits C-129 to C-297, legal authorities, Exhibits CL-67 to CL-113, and a second expert report of Mr. Abdul
Sirshar Qureshi of PricewaterhouseCoopers dated 4 May 2015 (“Second PWC Report”; Exhibit CER-3), as
well as an expert report of Mr. Abbas Mirza of ICF Limited dated 30 April 2015 (“Mirza Report”;
Exhibit CER-2).

7 Exhibits R-117 to R-148, legal authorities, Exhibits RL-26 to RL-49, witness statements, Exhibits RWS-3 to
RWS-5, and an expert report of Andrew Flower and Anthony Charlton of Deloitte dated 20 July 2015

By e-mail dated 4 September 2015, Claimant sought the Tribunal’s guidance on the question of
whether or not the Claimant could call Mr. Abbas Mirza, the Claimant’s industry expert, as a
witness at the hearing, even though Respondent had chosen not to call Mr. Mirza for
cross-examination in its witness notification of 20 August 2015. Taking into account the context
of Claimant’s request, the Tribunal decided on 7 September 2015 that Claimant was allowed to
call Mr. Mirza as a witness at the hearing for a short direct examination in order to be able to
rebut evidence submitted with Respondent’s Rejoinder, followed by cross and re-direct
examination if necessary.

On 14 September 2015, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties in order
to determine certain issues in preparation of the hearing scheduled for 12-17 October 2015. The
Parties had jointly submitted an annotated agenda for the pre-hearing teleconference on
11 September 2015, including their respective positions on disputed issues and their agreement
on others. By letter dated 18 September 2015, having considered the Parties’ positions, the
Tribunal determined the outstanding procedural issues upon which the Parties had not been able
to agree and fixed a preliminary hearing schedule.

 

By letter dated 14 September 2015, Claimant requested leave to submit six additional documents
into the record of the arbitration pursuant to Section 15.2 of Procedural Order No. 1. On
16 September 2015, Respondent stated its opposition to Claimant’s request. By letter dated
19 September 2015, the Tribunal granted Claimant leave to introduce four of the documents into
the record, on the basis that these documents were dated after Claimant’s last subm: mn and
updated figures already in the record; the Tribunal denied the request as to the remaining two

 

documents.

Between 12 and 16 October 2015, a hearing was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague. The
Parties submitted their views on all pending issues of this arbitration. The Tribunal heard factual
witnesses and the Parties’ appointed experts on the issue of quantum. At the end of the hearing,
the Tribunal invited the Parties’ experts to submit their data and calculation of damages under
different assumptions (described as Scenarios A, B, and C) on an Excel sheet that is capable of
being manipulated (“Scenario Calculations”).

On 23 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which it denied
Claimant’s request that Respondent be directed to resubmit its Experts’ Scenario Calculations,
granted Claimant’s request striking Exhibits 7-12 submitted with Respondent’s Experts’ Scenario
Calculations from the record, and denied the request that Respondent be directed to provide
English translations of the Polish legal authorities in the preliminary stage of exchange between
counsel. Procedural Order No. 4 thus ordered Respondent to resubmit its Experts’ Scenario
Calculations and Commentary without Exhibits 7-12, having removed all references to, and use
of, those Exhibits in the Calculations and Commentary.

the Flemingo Group (“Flemingo Group”), to establish a duty-free presence in India.”

To that end, on 5 March 2004, Flemingo DutyFree was incorporated in Mumbai, India to establish
and operate duty-free shops in the country.”

In 2010, the Flemingo Group entered the European duty-free market through its acquisition of a
majority stake in Przedsigbiorstwo Handlu Zagranicznego Baltona S.A. (“Baltona”), the largest
airport retail operator in Poland. The Flemingo Group made the acquisition through Flemingo
International Ltd. (“Flemingo International”), a company in
corporated in the British Virgin Islands, and Ashdod Holdings Limited (“Ashdod”), Flemingo
International’s wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Cyprus. Baltona had duty-free
operations at Chopin Airport through its Polish subsidiary, BH Travel.”!

 

On 31 March 2011, Flemingo DutyFree became the sole owner of Flemingo International. At the
time of Claimant’s filing of its Statement of Claim, Flemingo DutyFree held 84.8% of the shares
in Flemingo International (because of a further restructuring within the Flemingo Group that
occurred on 29 October 2012).

Entities related to Respondent

PPL was established on 23 October 1987 pursuant to the Polish Airports State Enterprise Act
1987 (“PPL Act”) in order to develop and operate airports in Poland.”’ PPL is a legal entity, the
shares of which wholly belong to the Polish State Treasury.** As previously mentioned, PPL
manages Chopin Airport.

According to Claimant, PPL is managed by its General Director but operates under the
supervision and control of the Minister responsible for transport and infrastructure, who appoints
and dismisses the General Director.** The Ministry responsible for transport and infrastructure
(hereinafter referred to as the “Ministry of Transport”) has at various times been the Ministry
of Transport (from May 2006), the Ministry of Infrastructure (from November 2007), the
Ministry of Transport, Construction and Maritime Economy (from November 2011), and the
Ministry of Infrastructure and Development (from November 2013).”°

Claimant asserts that the supervision of PPL’s activities by the Ministry of Transport:

includes monitoring the decisions of PPL’s management and their compliance with State
policy; evaluating the financial and economic situation of the company; controlling the

proper implementation of State-funded investment projects; identifying and handling any
issues or complaints relating to failures or irregularities in PPL’s performance; and
submitting periodic reports regarding the Ministry’s supervision of PPL’s activities?”

53. Claimant states that the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Transport, Mr. Zbigniew
Rynasiewicz, has expressly acknowledged the level of control by Respondent over PPL by saying
in the Polish Parliament that:”*

[PPL] is an enterprise which is functioning within the structure of the Ministry of
[Transport];?

and
[w]hen it comes to questions on investments [...] the supervision over PPL's action is
exercised by the minister responsible for transport and in a way we are also responsible for

all issues connected with the functioning of the enterprise [PPL] — at the Chopin Airport in
Warsaw.

 

54. Respondent, however, submits that PPL conducts its business activities “independently of the
Polish authorities and on the same principles as any other business entity”. Respondent further
submits that, pursuant to Article 9 of the PPL Act, PPL trades on its own account, is liable for its
liabilities, and is not responsible for the liabilities of the State Treasury or other legal persons.*!
Respondent also refers to Article 6 of the PPL Act,” which provides in relevant part:

1. PPL shall conduct its business operations independently, based on its own plans in line
with the objectives of the national socio-economic development plan.

2. PPL’s plans shall be determined by the General Director after consulting PPL's Employee
Council.

3. PPL’s economic activity shall be based on the principles of rational management and
economic calculation.

4. PPL shall manage its finances under the terms stipulated in separate regulations.*>

55. In this context, Respondent submits that PPL’s full name “Polish Airports State Enterprise” is “a
relic” of Poland’s past as a centrally planned economy and derives from formalities pursuant to
the Act of 25 September 1981 on State-owned enterprises (“Act on State-Owned Enterprises”).
Respondent submits that the Act on State-Owned Enterprises provides that a “State-owned
enterprise is an i self-governing and _ self- with legal

intangible assets which exceed EUR 50,000 in value and any legal action carried out without
such consent is deemed invalid.**

57. Claimant asserts that the State Treasury has actually shown the described level of control in PPL’s
dealings with Baltona and BH Travel by requiring approvals of the lease agreements that form
the subject matter of the present dispute (see below, para. 69), of certain amendments thereto,
and of a temporary rent reduction regarding one of the stores operated by BH Travel.*”

58. The Customs Chamber of Warsaw (“Customs Chamber”), organised under the Act on Customs
Service and operating under the supervision of the Ministry of Finance, controls the sale of
duty-free goods at Chopin Airport.**

59. The Governor of Mazovia is appointed by the Prime Minister of Poland as the regional
representative of the Polish government in the province of Mazovia, where Chopin Airport is
located. The Governor acts as the regional head of governmental institutions, manages central
government property within his province, and generally oversees local government.”

Negotiation and execution of the Lease Agreements

60. In May 2004, PPL began the construction of a new Terminal 2 for Chopin Airport
(“Terminal 2”).”°

61. On 29 July 2005, PPL invited Baltona to participate in a tender process for a concession to lease
and operate a number of premises in Chopin Airport’s Terminal | (“Terminal 1”) and Chopin
Airport’s Terminal 2, which was then still under construction.”! In early August 2005, PPL issued
the complete documentation for the first of two stages for the tender process.”

62. PPL first invited bidders to submit initial offers, which it would then evaluate based on several
criteria, including the proposed store concept, brand equity, and the minimum guaranteed
monthly rent per square metre. PPL would then select tenderers to submit their final offers.*?

% Act of 8 August 1996 on principles of implementing powers conferred on the State Treasury (extract), Article
Sa, Exhibit C-10: “State legal persons are obliged to obtain the consent of the minister competent for the State
Treasury to carry out a legal action in the scope of disposal of fixed assets components within the meaning of
the accounting regulations, qualified as intangible and legal values, tangible fixed assets or long-term
investments, including commissioning these assets for use by other entities on the basis of civil law contracts
or contributing them to a company or a cooperative, if the market value of the subject of disposal exceeds the
PLN equivalent of EUR 50,000, calculated on the basis of the average exchange rate announced by the
National Bank of Poland as of the date of filing a motion for granting the consent”.

63. A draft “framework” lease agreement (“Tenancy Pattern Agreement”) was included in the
initial tender documentation. The tender documentation also indicated that PPL expected
tenderers to propose the duration of the leases but expected the duration to be typically for a
period of ten years, with a possible extension of an additional five years."

64. On 30 September 2005, jointly with a German retailer and distributor of duty-free goods,
Gebruder Heinemann, and Baltona-Heinemann Sp. z 0.0. (collectively with Baltona,
“Baltona-Heinemann”), Baltona submitted an offer for the lease of commercial space at Chopin
Airport.*

65. At that time, Baltona’s shareholders included Alfa-Center Sp. z 0.0. (“Alfa-Center”) (a
privately-held Polish company), the State Treasury, and PPL.“

66. Upon PPL’s invitation, Baltona-Heinemann submitted its final offer on 27 January 2006. On
25 May 2006, Baltona-Heinemann established BH Travel as a 50/50 joint venture for the sole
purpose of operating retail stores at Chopin Airport should their bid be successful.”

67. By January 2007, BH Travel and PPL had held a number of meetings and exchanged
correspondence regarding the terms of the lease agreements."*

68. Between 23 April 2007 and 30 July 2008, PPL notified BH Travel that as a result of the tender
process it had been awarded a number of premises in Terminal | and Terminal 2 to use for stores
on the terms and conditions previously negotiated.”

69. Claimant submits that the ultimate conclusion of the intended lease agreements between PPL and
BH Travel depended on the approval of the State Treasury, and that this was repeatedly
confirmed by PPL to Baltona and BH Travel. *°

70. However, Respondent describes “the essence” of the process toward the eventual conclusion of
lease agreements between PPL and BH Travel as a “civil-law relationship”.*! Respondent
maintains that PPL “handles its own affairs related to everyday commercial business” and that
despite formal control, Respondent “does not interfere in these matters”: “[e]ven if the State
Treasury needs to approve PPL exercising a certain right, this approval is issued automatically”.

71. PPL sought the approval of the State Treasury for each of the intended lease agreements.** The

State Treasury approved each of PPL’s applications.**

After the State Treasury provided its approval, PPL and BH Travel entered into 11 lease
agreements (“Lease Agreements”) for the following premises in Terminals 1 and 2 of Chopin
Airport: (i) “Baltona Arrival”; (ii) “Baltona Jewelry”; (iii) “Baltona Perfumery”; (iv) “Baltona
Classic”; (v) “Baltona Esprit”; (vi) “Warehouse”; (vii) “Baltona Airport Shop”; (viii) “Baltona

Kid’s World”; (ix) “Baltona Accessories”; (x) “Social Rooms”; and (xi) “Baltona Bestseller”.**

 

The Lease Agreements, except those for the “Social Rooms” of BH Travel’s employees and the
“Warehouse”, provided for “guaranteed periods of lease” of four to seven years. The Lease
Agreements for Baltona Classic and Baltona Perfumery, which Claimant avers were BH Travel’s
most profitable stores, envisaged an extension of their seven-year lease terms to ten years.*°

Respondent submits that PPL and BH Travel intended “the Lease Agreements to give rise to the
operation of one, organized and coherently managed retail operation at Chopin Airport”. That is
why bidders had to propose their “own coherent functional concept” for the use of the retail
premises at Chopin Airport and had to “ensure the profitability of the whole project.”

According to the documentation of the first stage of the tender process, any offer needed to
encompass “at least 60% of the total space intended for commercial purposes in the terminal
complex combined from the existing Terminal 1 and the newly built Terminal 2”.**

76. Respondent maintains that at the time of the tender process and the negotiations, Baltona’s and
BH Travel’s representatives were aware of PPL’s expectation to have one coherent store concept
implemented by one contractor for both terminals of Chopin Airport. Respondent states that BH
Travel’s proposed fit-out for the whole of the retail spaces was therefore incorporated into the
Lease Agreements.”

77. Claimant submits that while the Lease Agreements were awarded to BH Travel as “part one of a

single commercial package”, they contained “individually negotiated terms” and constituted

Lf ined without any reference to other Lease or any s-defaul
provisions.”

78. The Lease Agreements were governed by the General Lease Conditions (“General Lease
Conditions”)."' Article 13 of the General Lease Conditions provides that:

The Lessor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect in the case of:

a) delay with payment of leasing fee for at least two periods by the Lessee,

b) delay with payment of maintenance fee for at least two periods,

c) failure to submit (non-payment), complete, or renew the bank guarantee (deposit)
under the terms specified in the Agreement,

d) failure to submit certified true copies of insurance policies, as well as failure to

renew the said insurance policies,

e) gross violation of the provisions of the Agreement by the Lessee and failure to
remove, within 14 days, of the condition contrary to the Agreement, despite of a
written reminder by the Lessor.

79. The following BH Travel stores were located in Chopin Airport’s duty-free zone (“DFZ”):
(i) Baltona Perfumery; (ii) Baltona Classic; (iii) Baltona Esprit; (iv) Baltona Accessories; (v)
Baltona Kid’s World; and (vi) Baltona Bestseller. PPL. managed the DFZ, which was governed
by the Rules of Operation of the Duty Free Zone at the Warsaw Chopin Airport (“DFZ Rules”)
issued by PPL and appended to the relevant Lease Agreements.

80. Article 7 of the DFZ Rules required BH Travel “to obtain permits from PPL” which
automatically expired if there was loss of title to use premises in the DFZ.® Additionally,

provision states: “The permit referred to in § 7, clause 1 expires in the case of: a. the failure to sign the
agreement referred to in § 7, clause 2 within 30 days of the date of its issue, b. the loss of the title to use the

permits:

The Lessor approves and allows the Lessee to conduct its business activities referred to in
§ | section 2 in the premises located within the duty-free zone. Permission referred to in the
preceding sentence constitutes Appendix 8 to the Agreement and shall expire or may be
revoked in accordance with the provisions of “Regulations for the Operation of Duty Free
Zone at the Warsaw Chopin Airport”, a copy of which constitutes Appendix 9 to the
Agreement, resulting in the termination of the Agreement with immediate effect and the
return of the premises by the Lessee in accordance with § 8 of the Agreement.

81. The applicable Polish customs legislation also required BH Travel to obtain the Customs
Chamber’s approval for the planned type of activity within the DFZ.”

82. BH Travel obtained all the required permits and approvals for selling goods within the DFZ, with
the permits appended to the relevant Lease Agreements. The Director of the Customs Chamber
approved BH Travel’s operations in the DFZ on 24 August 2008; the approval was amended on
1 September 2011.

The acquisition of BH Travel

83. Through an announcement on its website on 28 January 2010, the State Treasury sought tenders
for the acquisition of its minority stake in Baltona.”°

84. According to Claimant, in early February that year, Mr. Atul Ahuja learned about that call for
tenders “and saw the bid for the State Treasury’s stake in Baltona — Poland’s largest airport
retailer — as a golden opportunity to enter the European duty-free market ‘given the size of
Baltona’s business and its brand equity””.”!

85. Mr. Atul Ahuja sought the advice of Messrs. Maciej Dworniak and Tomasz Jaron of the Polish
financial advisory firm Bastion Capital Sp. z 0.0. (“Bastion”) to prepare tender documentation
and to undertake pre-acquisition due diligence.”

86. After Bastion informed Mr. Atul Ahuja that Alfa-Center was also seeking to divest its majority
stake in Baltona, Mr. Atul Ahuja also engaged Bastion to advise and assist in acquiring that

 

  

premises within the DEZ, c. a motion from the customs authority on the breach of the regulations arising from
the Customs Law and the Community Customs Code”.

stake.”*

87. The Flemingo Group and Bastion’s formal due diligence on Baltona in February and March 2010
indicated that approximately 40% of Baltona’s business in Poland pertained to BH Travel’s shops
in Chopin Airport.

88. Claimant submits that Mr. Atul Ahuja specifically inquired about the duration of the Lease
Agreements and “was satisfied that ‘[t]he terms of the leases [...] guaranteed Baltona’s long-term
presence at Chopin Airport,’ which was a ‘key aspect of [the Flemingo Group’s] business plan
to improve Baltona’s profitability in the following years’”. Mr. Jaron of Bastion considered the
guaranteed periods to be “one of the major value drivers in the transaction”. He viewed Baltona
to be “well-positioned [as the incumbent] to extend its presence at Chopin Airport past the expiry
of the guaranteed periods of lease”.”*

89. Swamy & Chhabra, which performed the financial due diligence, concluded that Baltona was in
arrears on its rental payments to airport authorities and that “[n]on payment of dues to airport
authorities immediately can trigger serious actions including possible termination which could
severely affect the [company’s] business viability”.”°

90. Swamy & Chhabra further observed that acquiring Baltona “present[ed] exciting opportunities
for growth” although it “ha[d] been bleeding for some time”.”” That observation was consistent
with the State Treasury’s statement in the tender materials in January 2010 where it indicated
that despite Baltona’s worsening condition, “the increase in air passenger traffic, the expansion
of existing airports and the availability of EU financing programs represented ‘opportunities’ for
growth and financial recovery”.”

91. Mr. Atul Ahuja resolved to proceed with acquiring Alfa-Center’s and the State Treasury’s shares
in Baltona.”

92. In February 2010, Mr. Atul Ahuja agreed with the owners of Alfa-Center, in principle, on the
acquisition of Alfa-Center’s majority stake in Baltona. Mr. Atul Ahuja likewise met with
representatives of the Ministry of the Treasury to request an extension of the deadline for
submissions of bids for the Ministry’s shares in Baltona. That deadline was extended until
15 March 2010.

93. On 13 March 2010, Bastion acquired Culex Sp. z 0.0. (“Culex”), a “shelf company” incorporated
in Poland, for the sole purpose of participating in the tender; Culex was later transferred to
Mr. Atul Ahuja.*!

94. Two days later, on 15 March 2010, Flemingo International submitted its bid for the State
Treasury’s stake in Baltona through Culex.

95. Respondent submits that during the tender proceedings for the State Treasury’s stock in Baltona,
the planned modernisation of Terminal 1 was also disclosed to potential investors."

96. On30 March 2010, Culex signed a share purchase agreement with Alfa-Center for the acquisition
of a 59.94% stake in Baltona. Flemingo International and Baltona concluded a loan agreement
on the same day in the amount of US$ 1.35 million for the repayment of Baltona’s debts to
various third parties, including suppliers and airport authorities.“

97. After winning the State Treasury’s tender process, Culex signed a share purchase agreement with
the State Treasury on 22 June 2010 to acquire its 26.83% shareholding in Baltona. Culex then
transferred that stake to Ashdod pursuant to three consecutive share purchase agreements.**

98. Acting through Mr. Jaron of Bastion, Ashdod offered to buy PPL’s 12.5% stake in Baltona in
late 2010. Ashdod and PPL concluded a conditional share purchase agreement on 16 December
2010 for that stake, subject to the State Treasury’s approval. That approval was granted and the
acquisition of PPL’s shares was perfected on 27 January 2011. Ashdod thereafter transferred a
portion of those shares to Globexxon Investment Limited (“Globexxon”) and Fivedex
Investments Limited (“Fivedex’), both Cypriot companies owned and controlled by Messrs.
Jaron and Dworniak of Bastion.

99. The shares of Alfa-Center, the State Treasury and PPL in Baltona had a total purchase price in
excess of PLN 30 million or EUR 7 million.*’

100. On 31 March 2011, Claimant acquired all of the shares in Flemingo International.

101. The Parties hold differing views as to Claimant’s participation in the acquisition of Baltona.
Respondent submits that Claimant “did not participate financially in any way in the process of
acquiring Baltona’s stock”. Respondent says that Baltona’s stock was instead acquired by Culex,
which later transferred its ownership interest to Ashdod. Respondent submits that Claimant’s
only contribution to the acquisition of Baltona was issuing a bond guarantee in respect of the
purchase of Alfa-Center’s shares in Baltona by Culex.”

 

102. Claimant contends that it was “heavily involved in the acquisition and management of Baltona
and BH Travel” by leading the negotiations and due diligence in the acquisition process,
providing financial support for the transaction (mainly two corporate guarantees provided to
Alfa-Center and a comfort letter to the State Bank of India regarding a loan to Flemingo
International), and being responsible (in the person of Mr. Atul Ahuja) for the final decision on
the acquisition, as well as by employing its managerial expertise to the operations of BH Travel
after the transaction.”

103. Respondent denies that the appointment of directors of Claimant as members of Baltona’s or
BH Travel’s supervisory or management boards evidences that Claimant played an active role in
the acquisition and operation of the two companies. Respondent submits that the concerned
individuals served multiple functions in the corporate structure of the Flemingo Group, such that
their appointment to another office did not indicate their actual involvement.”

104. Respondent maintains that Flemingo International, and not Claimant, acted as “the proper
investor and owner” of Baltona upon the acquisition of its stock.’ Respondent submits that
Claimant “has not proved in any way that any financial flows took place with the change in the
structure of the Flemingo Group” when Claimant acquired all of the shares in Flemingo
International.”?

105. Claimant responds that, while it had held no direct or indirect shareholding in Baltona or
BH Travel before March 2011, since the acquisition of Flemingo International (for a total
consideration of USD 26,505,000) on 31 March 2011, it has consistently been an indirect
controlling shareholder of BH Travel and Baltona. Claimant explains that from this time onward
it owned all of the shares in Flemingo International; Flemingo International held all of the shares
in Ashdod; Ashdod at all times owned over 80% of Baltona’s shares; and Baltona (after April
2011) owned all of the shares in BH Travel.™*

106. It is not disputed that Claimant is not the “ultimate beneficiary” of the Flemingo Group. Claimant
explains that after its acquisition of Flemingo International its shares were held by Flemingo
International (BVI) Limited (“Flemingo BVI”) (45.04%), Mr. Viren Ahuja (24.59%), Mr. Atul
Ahuja (24.59%), and two other companies (Symbolic Infra Projects Private Limited (1.93%) and
Sites Infra Projects Private Limited (3.85%)). The shares in Flemingo BVI were held by
Sapphaire International Limited (“Sapphaire”) (78.8%), Commodities Services International
(“CSI”) (5.73%), and four individuals (Messrs. Rasiklal Thakker (4.45%), Suresh Tulsidas
Bhatia (4.45%), Hemchand Chaturbhujdas Gandhi (4.45%), and Mahandra Thakar (2.12%)).
Finally, Mr. Atul Ahuja owned 60% of the shares in Sapphaire, while his sons, Arjun and Karan,
each owned 20%.°* 77.28% of the shares of Flemingo International were thus owned directly or
indirectly by members of the Ahuja family.

107. By 13 April 2011, BH Travel became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Baltona after Mr. Tomasz
Jaron negotiated Baltona’s acquisition of Gebruder Heinemann’s remaining shares in BH
Travel.°°

108. Baltona became a publicly-listed company on NewConnect, the alternative market of the Warsaw
Stock Exchange on 30 June 2011. Because of that public offering and the aforementioned transfer
of shares to Globexxon and Fivedex, Ashdod’s stake in Baltona was reduced to 80.68%.°”

The development of Baltona’s business after its acquisition by the Flemingo Group

109. According to Claimant, at the time of its acquisition by the Flemingo Group, Baltona did not
generate profits, had serious cash-flow issues resulting from high overheads and low sales, and
was on the brink of bankruptcy.”*

110. Respondent submits that after the acquisition of Baltona by the Flemingo Group, BH Travel
continued to be “poorly managed” and had not achieved the desired financial profits, as
evidenced by a remaining high level of debt, no improvement on margins in the core business
areas, and limited effects of cost restructuring attempts.”

111. However, Claimant maintains that through a change in management, an influx of capital, and the
Flemingo Group’s “longstanding experience in the duty-free industry”, it achieved an economic
turnaround of Baltona and BH Travel between early 2010 and late 2011.'°

112. Claimant explains that the management team of Baltona was almost completely replaced by
experienced and accomplished new staff,'°' and that the Flemingo Group injected significant
amounts of cash into Baltona through several channels in order to settle its debt and increase its

financial operability. Claimant adds that the Flemingo Group restructured BH Travel’s supply
chain away from buying through intermediaries such as Gebruder Heinemann to establishing
direct contracts with suppliers, that it negotiated rent reductions, and that it also renovated
BH Travel's stores.'?

113. Based on these changes, Claimant submits that it achieved significant sales growth, as evidenced
by an increase in sales in the third quarter of 2011 by over 15% and in the fourth quarter of 2011
by over 30% (as compared to the same respective periods in 2010). Claimant further submits that,
while revenues and earnings suffered a significant decrease due to the termination of the Lease
Agreements, the positive business trend prevailed in the time following, when revenues increased
by 39.6% in the first quarter of 2015 (as compared to the first quarter of 2014), triggered by
significant increases in airport passenger traffic and spending per passenger.'”

The planned modernisation of Chopin Airport

114. PPL’s 2007 Annual Report indicated plans for the completion of Terminal 2 of Chopin Airport
as well as the modernisation of Terminal | and its integration with Terminal 2.'"

115. On 24 September 2008, PPL and the Centre for EU Transport Projects (*CEUTP”) signed an
agreement (“CEUTP Agreement”) for the implementation of the project on the “Integration of
Terminal 1 with Terminal 2 and modernization of Terminal 1”.'°*

116. The Polish Ministry of Transport had established CEUTP as the implementing body for funds
from the European Union under the Operational Programme Infrastructure and Environment
(2007-2013) (“OPI&E”) prepared by the Polish Ministry of Regional Development and
approved by the European Commission in December 2007.' Under the CEUTP Agreement,
CEUTP was tasked with providing “institutional supervision [...] to prepare the project for the
implementation correctly and on time”.'””

117. PPL’s 2009 Annual Report stated that “work was undertaken to prepare an application for [EU]
funding of the ‘Warsaw Airport — modernization of infrastructure’ project”, although Claimant
notes that the report did not indicate the anticipated schedule of the planned modernisation or its
impact on Terminal 1’s operations.'°*

118. In August 2010, the deadline for the modernisation project was extended to 2014. The availability
of PLN 114.0 million in EU funding was subject to the completion of the project by the agreed

119. In view of PPL’s planned modernisation of Terminal 1, on 12 February 2009, Poland enacted the
Act on Specific Rules Governing the Preparation and Implementation of Investments Concerning
Public Airports (“Airport Act”). The Airport Act is the legislative framework for the
“construction, reconstruction, or expansion of a public airport”.!"°

120. The Airport Act required PPL to obtain approval from the Governor of Mazovia for the planned
modernisation of Terminal 1.''' Article 3 of the Airport Act provided that:

The competent governor shall issue a decision approving the investment concerning [the]
public airport no later than 3 months from the date of submission of an application by the
entity establishing the airport, the entity managing the airport, or the Polish Air Navigation
Services Agency.!!2

121.

Article 27(2) of the Airport Act also provided that:

If the property intended for the airport owned by the State Treasury or local government
units has been leased, let for usufruct, rented or lent, the decision regarding the permit to
implement investments concerning public airport shall provide the ground for termination
of the lease, usufruct, rental or lending with immediate effect.'"5

122. Further, Article 27(3) of the Airport Act stated:

Loss suffered as a result of termination of agreements referred to in Sec. 2 shall be subject
to compensation. !'*

The Flemingo Group’s knowledge about the planned modernisation of Terminal 1

123. Respondent submits that on 5 May 2009 representatives from Baltona and BH Travel met with
PPL and the architects from the design office Estudio Lamela to discuss the modernisation of
Terminal | of Chopin Airport under the then existing preliminary plans. Respondent states that,
at this meeting, the attendees confirmed their willingness to conclude appropriate agreements in
the future to modify principles for leasing premises in relation to the planned modernisation.''*

124. Claimant contends that Mr. Jaron (of Bastion), who Respondent claims was present at the
meeting, is “not aware of any meeting with Estudio Lamela in May 2009 and could not locate
any record of such meeting at BH Travel or Baltona”. According to Mr. Jarof, even if any
amendment of the Lease Agreements had been discussed, it would have been his understanding
that “in the event of any modernization, the lease agreements would be extended for a period
equivalent to the duration of the modernization, in order to allow PPL to proceed with the works
while protecting BH Travel’s rights under its long-term lease agreements”.'!°

125. The Parties disagree on the level of sophistication of the plans for modernisation of Terminal 1
around the time of the purported meeting in 2009. While Claimant asserts that the planning was
still rather undeveloped at the time,'!? Respondent maintains that the “concept of the
modernization of Terminal | actually emerged in 2009” and that it could be foreseen that the
terminal would be “out of service for a long period”.''®

126. Respondent submits that during a meeting on 2 March 2010, PPL’s Management Board informed
Bastion and the Flemingo Group (Mr. Jaron and Mr. Ahuja) about the planned modernisation of
Terminal 1, including its closure during the modernisation.”

127. However, Claimant contends that Bastion and the Flemingo Group were not thus informed by
PPL at the meeting of 2 March 2010. Claimant submits that it is “commercially nonsensical” to
assume that they had been informed as Respondent suggests, since the Flemingo Group would
not have pursued the acquisition of Baltona had it known that the business at the stores in
Terminal 1 would be “suspended or even liquidated”. Claimant states that, instead, after the
meeting, the Flemingo Group had the impression that the modernisation could increase passenger
flows and enhance revenue without a significant interruption of the ongoing business.'”°

128. Claimant submits that the Flemingo Group learned about the planned modernisation of
Terminal | of Chopin Airport during the course of its due diligence prior to the purchase of shares
in Baltona in February and March 2010. However, Claimant contends that Respondent did not
inform BH Travel, Baltona, or any other member of the Flemingo Group about the schedule of
the modernisation or its impact on BH Travel’s operations in Terminal 1 until a meeting between
PPL and Baltona’s management on 8 December 2011.'?!

2 July 2010 to all entities that had office premises in Terminal 1, but not to those who only had
retail and service activities in the terminal.”

132. PPL’s 2 July 2010 letter to BH Travel also: (i) solicited BH Travel’s views on the proposed
relocation of rented premises; (ii) asked BH Travel to take into account “PPL’s limited
capabilities in terms of ensuring replacement premises within the area of the Terminal for all its
users”; and (iii) urged BH Travel to “treat this matter as urgent” and to respond in writing within
three business days, which was 7 July 2010."

133. Mr. Jaron of Bastion explains that the letter was the “first correspondence from PPL about its
plans for the modernization of Terminal 1”. Given that BH Travel occupied a “vast majority” of
the commercial space in Terminal | and had a stake in the planned modernisation, Mr. Jaron
asserts that “[he] expected that PPL would at the very least offer to meet with [BH Travel] to
discuss the impact of the planned modernization rather than send what appeared to be a
perfunctory letter”.'?7

134. The Baltona and BH Travel Management Boards agreed to inquire regarding the schedule of the
modernisation and its full impact on Terminal 1’s operations before expressing any views on
PPL’s proposal.'**

135. On 6 July 2010, BH Travel informed PPL of its inability to provide a “full and substantial
position” on the proposed relocation of its stores in Terminal | absent any information on “which
premises it should concern” as well as the “estimated period of the exclusion”. BH Travel

requested “detailed explanations” from PPL.'”?

136. On 13 August 2010, PPL informed BH Travel that it was “unable to define the exact date of

Baltona and BH Travel did not receive further information from PPL on the planned
modernisation of Terminal | until the end of the summer of 2011. In September 2011, Baltona’s
new Director of Business Development and a member of its Management Board, Mr. Piotr
Kazimierski, contacted PPL @ Mr. [PN], Chopin Airport’s Director of the Commercial
Department), to arrange a meeting to discuss BH Travel’s business operations in Chopin
Airport.'!

On 9 September 2011, a meeting between Baltona and PPL was attended by — for Baltona:
Ms. Magda Grzybowska, former President of Baltona’s Management Board, Ms. Anna Sobieska,
Project Manager at Baltona, and Mr. Kazimierski; and for PPL: ; | Mr. [PN], ; | Mr. [RB], and
other representatives from PPL. Mr. Kazimierski describes the meeting as, to his knowledge, “the
first official meeting between Baltona/BH Travel and PPL in approximately two years”.'*

An e-mail from Baltona dated 9 September 2011 indicates that during the meeting, the attendees
discussed the planned modernisation of Terminal 1, among other issues." According to
Baltona’s e-mail, ; | Mr. [PN] also stated on behalf of PPL that: (i) PPL had not yet finalised
preparatory works for the modernisation plan; (ii) PPL could not confirm the schedule or impact
of the plan on BH Travel’s operations in Terminal 1; (iii) the Polish parliamentary elections in
October 2011 would probably delay or disrupt the planned modernisation; and (iv) he would
revert with additional information regarding the architectural design of the new terminal and the
schedule for the planned works by the end of 201 1.'* Despite that, PPL did not correspond further
with BH Travel regarding the planned modernisation.

Communications and developments in the run-up to the termination of the Lease
Agreements

On 8 December 2011, Mr. Andrzej Uryga, Mr. Witold Kruszewski and Mr. Kazimierski, all
members of Baltona’s Management Board, met with Messrs. J [PN] and JJ [RB] of PPL."S
The meeting was to discuss the status of PPL’s planned modernisation of Terminal 1.'°°

 

Respondent adds that during that meeting, PPL stated that the planned modernisation of
Terminal 1 would begin in August 2012 and would require PPL to shut down Terminal 1 by
3 July 2012. PPL further explained: (i) that it was at that point “looking to terminate” lease
agreements for premises within Terminal 1; (ii) that it was entitled to unilaterally terminate the

European Union co-financed the modernisation project and that the availability of that funding
was subject to the completion of the project by the end of 2014.'*”

 

142. Responding to PPL’s proposal, Baltona expressed its willingness to negotiate the closure of
BH Travel’s stores in Terminal 1. According to Claimant, Baltona refrained from commenting
on the terms and conditions of any such closures."** Respondent insists that Baltona’s and
BH Travel’s representatives “twice agreed” at the meeting to the mutual termination of the Lease
Agreements, but Claimant denies having made such an agreement.'*?

143. According to Respondent, during the meeting, the following matters were also discussed: (i)
“BH Travel’s problems with payments”; (ii) “BH Travel’s requests to forgive some of the interest
due to PPL”; (iii) “BH Travel’s requests to adjust the rent from the commissions payable in
connection with the incorrect recording of sales revenues of individual product groups during the
period October 2008 — May 2011”; and (iv) BH Travel’s “missing bank guarantees”.'"°

144. In his witness statement, Mr. Kazimierski of Baltona explains that he “expected that this meeting
would be the basis for further negotiations and that both parties would have the opportunity to

submit their respective proposals”.'*!

 

145. : | Mr. [PN] testified before the Tribunal that the Airport Act (referred to by him as the “Special
Act on the Construction of the Terminal” or “Special Act”) was not discussed nor mentioned

during the 8 December 2011 meeting.'*

146. On 9 December 2011, PPL sent a summary of the 8 December meeting to Baltona and
BH Travel.'* In this summary, PPL (i) confirmed that the “hand-over of the commercial space
to PPL by the lessees [was] scheduled for 4 July to 31 July 2012 in order to enable the
modernization contractor to take-over the construction site on 1 August 2012”; (ii) reiterated its
proposal that the parties mutually agree to terminate BH Travel’s relevant Lease Agreements in
Terminal 1; and (iii) asserted that “BH [had] confirmed its willingness to terminate the lease by
mutual agreement on 3 July 2012 and to hand-over the commercial space to PPL by 31 July
2012”."4 J Mr. [PN] further testified that he took notes during the meeting on 8 December

Exhibit C-63. See also Statement of Defence, paras. 124, 127. Il Mr. [MM] explains that PPL’s partners in
Warsaw showed that they accepted the solution they offered. PPL did not see any conflicts. He states that PPL
“could not offer them any guarantees that if they terminate amicably, they will have certain guarantees of

2011, and that he believed everybody took notes for their own personal use. However, he testified
that he no longer had his notes and had not shared them with other PPL employees.'*° The Parties
did not sign any written agreement during the meeting on 8 December 2011.

147. According to or. [PN]’s testimony, some of BH Travel’s stores performed poorly financially
at that time. He said that the termination of the Lease Agreements would have afforded BH Travel
an “opportunity” to win the new tender, to redesign their stores, change their product range and
improve their performance. : | Mr. [PN] believed that it was good for BH Travel’s business to
abandon all of its leases in Terminal 1.'“°

148. Mr. Kazimierski disagreed with PPL’s summary of the meeting and expressed to his Baltona
colleagues his concern that PPL seemed to have “a different understanding of [the] discussion
and statements as to the renovation of Terminal 1”. In his e-mail on 9 December 2011 to Messrs.
Uryga, Kruszewski, and Dworniak, Mr. Kazimierski explained:

We did not confirm that we agree to terminate the lease by mutual agreement on 3 July 2011.
We have certainly not confirmed our will [sic] to hand over premises until 31 July 2012. It
was [...] PPL that informed us on such plan in relation to the closing of [the] terminal on 3
July. We said that we are interested to reach consensus with regard to the termination of the
activity consisting in running shops due to the renovation of the terminal but not to terminate
the lease agreement.”

149. In his testimony, | Mr. [PN] denied that there was simply a misunderstanding between the
BH Travel and PPL representatives during the 8 December 2011 meeting, stating that “there were
so many people in the meeting” but that “everyone understood the same thing”.'**

150. In his witness statement, Mr. Kazimierski describes PPL’s account of the 8 December 2011
meeting as “highly misleading” and explains that “it would have made no commercial sense for
[Baltona] to abandon the leases without receiving adequate compensation for PPL’s early
termination and PPL was well aware of that”, a view which is repeated by Mr. Atul Ahuja in his
witness statement.'?

151. Hi Mr. [MM], General Director of PPL and Director of Chopin Airport, testified that, as far as
he could recall, PPL did not pay compensation to any other tenant for giving up its lease.'*” Hi
Mr. [PN] confirmed that he never spoke with the relevant governor about compensation. '*! | |

Mr. [PN] affirmed that to his knowledge there was no budget for compensation.’ He also stated

that the other tenants vacated the premises voluntarily and no compensation was paid.'*>

Claimant submits that, in light of the conflicting summaries of the 8 December 2011 meeting,
Mr. Ahuja instructed Baltona’s Management Board to undertake every effort to conclude a
mutually-agreeable settlement with PPL.'**

On 13 December 2011, PPL wrote to BH Travel, stating:

[W]e would like to put forward our proposal made at the meeting on 8 December this year
regarding the termination of the lease agreements with BH Travel Retail Poland Sp. z 0.0.
[...] by mutual agreement, effective as of 3 July 2012. In submitting this proposal — given
your acceptance expressed at the meeting on 8 December regarding the termination of lease
agreements by mutual consent with effect from 3 July 2012 — we kindly request that you
confirm this decision in writing, in order to enable the preparation of a respective declaration
to confirm the accepted arrangements between the Parties as regards terminating the
agreements on 3 July 2012 and returning the retail spaces to PPL by 31 July 2012.'55

In his witness statement, Mr. Kazimierski notes with respect to PPL’s 13 December 2011 letter
that “PPL seemed to be assuming that the issue of termination of the leases had already been
resolved, and that all that was left for BH Travel to do was to sign off on the proposed termination
and vacate the premises before 31 July”.'*°

  

By letter dated 4 January 2012,'*’ BH Travel through its counsel Beiten Burkhardt: (i) rejected
PPL’s proposal regarding the termination of the relevant Lease Agreements and its assertion that
the parties had already reached agreement in that regard; (ii) noted that the proposed termination
of the relevant Lease Agreements “would generate losses running into Hi of zlotys for BH
Travel on the account of capital expenditures incurred by BH Travel on conversion of the retail
spaces as well as damage to the assets of BH Travel on the account of lost profits during the
guaranteed term of the Lease Agreements”; and (iii) contended that PPL could not unilaterally
terminate the Lease Agreements before the expiration of the guaranteed periods of lease.'**

BH Travel also proposed to meet to renegotiate the terms of the Lease Agreements which it
suggested should be pursuant to the following terms, with PPL’s 2 July 2010 letter and the
provision of alternative retail spaces as starting points, stating:

[T]he manner in which the problem will be resolved must take into account the economic
interests of BH Travel, in particular the fact that BH Travel will be denied the opportunity
to achieve the planned revenues during the period of modernisation works in Terminal 1. In
addition, a solution acceptable to BH Travel must also take into account the fact that some

of the Retail Spaces will be unavailable to BH Travel due to the modernisation works for as
long as half the guaranteed period of [the] lease.'?

157. PPL responded by letter dated 13 January 2012, in which it expressed its “astonishment” at
BH Travel’s 4 January 2012 letter and requested clarification.’ PPL reasserted that, during their
8 December 2011 meeting, PPL and BH Travel had mutually agreed to terminate the relevant
Lease Agreements and that BH Travel had signalled its willingness to participate in the tender
procedure for the lease of new retail spaces in Terminal 1.'°'

158. On 1 February 2012, PPL sent four separate letters to BH Travel regarding various obligations
under the Lease Agreements, including on the maintenance of BH Travel’s website’ and access
to BH Travel’s IT registration systems,'® among other obligations.'“ Claimant avers that PPL
had not previously raised those issues with BH Travel.'®

159. On 3 February 2012, BH Travel applied to the Regional Court for injunctive relief delaying the
modernisation works on Chopin Airport’s Terminal 1 until the resolution of the dispute with PPL
concerning BH Travel’s stores.’ Respondent submits that BH Travel also filed two actions to
block the modernisation of Terminal 1 on 6 February 2012. Respondent further notes that PPL
“found out about one of these motions being filed as late as on 17 February 2012” after the motion
had been dismissed and the Lease Agreements had been terminated.'”

 

  

160. Mr. Kazimierski of Baltona asserts that, in light of PPL’s letter dated 1 February 2012, BH Travel
became “concerned that PPL appeared to be fishing for any possible violation that it could rely
upon as a pretense to invoke the termination provision in the leases and unilaterally cancel
BH Travel’s rights”.'** BH Travel responded by letters of 7 February 2012 and 16 February 2012
expressing its surprise at PPL’s demands and the “intensity of communication” over issues of

“slight” or smaller importance. BH Travel also urged PPL to “immediately resume the

discussions on the key subject for the relationship between PPL and BH Travel”.

161. Ina letter dated 8 February 2012 to ; | Mr. [MM], BH Travel again proposed renegotiating the
terms of the relevant Lease Agreements, asked PPL to submit a proposal to settle the matter, and
invited PPL to meet to discuss any settlement.'” BH Travel also indicated that it “was compelled
under the circumstances” to initiate legal action to protect its rights.'” Finally, BH Travel
asserted that “PPL’s unlawful conduct engaged the responsibility of the Polish State”.!”? Jj Mr.
[MM] did not respond to BH Travel’s letter.'”

 

162. By letter dated 10 February 2012, PPL notified BH Travel’s Management Board regarding its
approval of a revised set of DFZ Rules, effective as of 20 February 2012. PPL requested
BH Travel to return signed appendices to the Lease Agreements incorporating the revised set of
DFZ Rules.'*

163. Under Article 8(2) of the revised DFZ Rules sent to BH Travel, the following was added as a
ground for withdrawing the required permit for conducting business activity within the DFZ:
commencement by the Operator of “adaptation/modernization works in DFZ affecting the
functioning of the DFZ or resulting in an alteration of its borders”.!”* Claimant submits that PPL
had thus attempted to introduce “through the back door” a new ground for the unilateral

termination of the Lease Agreements on the basis of the modernisation.'”

 

164. Respondent submits that it perceived BH Travel’s ication for interim measures of 3 February
2012 as an “obvious threat[]” to block the modernisation of Terminal 1. In response, PPL said
that it could no longer tolerate BH Travel’s breaches of contract and “was forced to enforce the
performance of the Lease Agreements on BH Travel”.'””

165. ; | Mr. [MM] testified that, from his point of view, it had become difficult to negotiate with
BH Travel, because of the nearly 90 lawsuits filed against PPL.'*

Termination of the Lease Agreements

166. On 16 February 2012, PPL sent BH Travel 11 separate notices of termination for the Lease
Agreements with immediate effect and requested that the leased premises be returned within
30 days.!” Each of the notices stated as follows:

Acting on the basis of the provisions item 13 subitem 1 letter c) and d) of the General
Conditions of Lease, the ‘Polish Airports” State Enterprise terminates with immediate effect
the lease agreement [...]. Pursuant to §8 of the abovementioned agreement, BH Travel Retail
Poland Sp. z 0.0. is obliged to return the property leased within 30 days from the day
following the termination of the agreement.

167. ; | Mr. [PN] testified before the Tribunal that it was he who made the decision to terminate the
Lease Agreements with BH Travel. He recommended termination to ; | Mr. [MM], who
accepted it.'*°

168. PPL based the termination of the Lease Agreements on two grounds: (i) failure to submit,
complete or renew bank guarantees under Article 13(1)(c) of the General Lease Conditions; and
(ii) failure to renew and submit certified copies of insurance policies under Article 13(1)(d) of
the General Lease Conditions.'*' Articles 13(1)(c) and (d) provide:

The Lessor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect in
the case of:

c) failure to submit (non-payment), complete, or renew the bank guarantee (deposit)
under the terms specified in the Agreement,

d) failure to submit certified true copies of insurance policies, as well failure to renew
the said insurance policies,

BH Travel would “continue doing business until June without paying rent [...]”. He also believed he “would
soon be without any guarantees, without any insurance, stuck with a partner that was not performing on its
obligations”. See Hearing Transcript (13 October 2015), 182:17-19.

terminate the Lease Agreements, [if Mr. [PN] stated the following: “[...] because the law firm was introduced
as our partner for dialogue, we ceased having a partner in the person of BH Travel. So when the conflict
became acute, and when we were facing huge damages, and when we saw that there was a process kicking in,
an attempt to make a fraud, or that this was [the] kind of game, so we made a decision to terminate our
cooperation with BH Travel”. Hearing Transcript (14 October 2015), 10:19 to 11:1.

and was not given an opportunity to cure any breaches.'**

The first ground for terminating the Lease Agreements, failure to complete or renew bank
guarantees, was based on the following: under Article 4(1) of the General Lease Conditions,
BH Travel had to submit bank guarantees covering the minimum lease fees for a one-year period.
Those guarantees had to be renewed by a certain date before the expiry of the existing bank
guarantees. Article 6(1)(d) of the General Lease Conditions provided that the guarantees were to
be adjusted to a revaluation of the yearly minimum lease fees, as notified by 1 February every
year,'**

At the time of the termination of the Lease Agreements by PPL on 16 February 2012, BH Travel
had delivered bank guarantees covering the (unadjusted) minimum rent amount to PPL that were
valid until 31 March 2012.'°

By notice of 1 February 2012, the minimum lease fees had been increased in accordance with the
revaluation procedure by [l%, effective from 2 March 2012.'*° Under the General Lease
Conditions, BH Travel was obligated to submit bank guarantees adjusted to this increase
by 15 February 2012.'*’ Article 4.1 of the Lease Agreements provided:

The Lessee undertakes to adjust the amount of bank guarantee accordingly in the event of
change in the minimum leasing fee in accordance with § 3 section 2, or in the case of change
in the area in accordance with the “Control Quantity Survey Protocol”, within 14 days from
the date of change.'**

BH Travel had not submitted adjusted bank guarantees by the time PPL sent its notice of
termination on 16 February 2012.'°

The second ground for terminating the Lease Agreements, failure to renew and submit certified
copies of insurance policies, had the following basis: Article 11(4) of the General Lease
Conditions required BH Travel to present new insurance policies for the upcoming year at least
14 days before the expiration of the existing insurance policies:

Insurance policies shall be valid for a period of at least 12 consecutive months from the date
of issue. In each case, at least 14 days before the end of another 12-month period, the Lessee
shall submit to the Lessor the certified true copy of the subsequent insurance contract, valid
for a further 12 consecutive months period.!”

Respondent argues that because the existing insurance policies expired on 29 February 2012,
BH Travel had to submit certified copies of the new insurance policies by 15 February 2012.'"!
Claimant argues, however that the existing insurance policies were valid until 29 February 2012,

and thus expired on 1 March 2012.'” In Claimant's view the 14-day deadline therefore includes
29 February 2012, meaning that it was required to submit the renewed insurance policies by
16 February 2016. !3

176. BH Travel had renewed the insurance policies on 14 February 2012 and submitted them to PPL
on 16 February 2012.'* Respondent submits that PPL had sent the notice of termination on
16 February 2012 before it received the renewed insurance policies from BH Travel.'*

177. Claimant submits that the Warsaw Court of Appeal (“Court of Appeal”), in the context of
injunction proceedings and on a prima facie basis, observed that PPL’s termination of the Lease
Agreements was invalid.'°°

178. Claimant submits that the Court of Appeal stated that Article 13(1)(c) of the General Lease
Conditions did not provide a legal basis for a termination of the Lease Agreements due to a failure
to adjust bank guarantees to an increase of the lease fee:'*”

[Article 13(1)(c) of the General Lease Conditions] refers to various forms of violating the
lessee’s obligations in connection with the provision of security in the form of a bank
guarantee, but it does not mention the failure to adjust the bank guarantee to the changed
amount of the minimum lease rent.'°*

179. Claimant points out that the Court of Appeal also stated :

The circumstances of the case show that the claimant extremely instrumentally used the right
arising from Article 13(1)(d) of the [General Lease Conditions] in the apparent conflict
between the Lessor and the Lessee. The parties mutually obey the rules of contractual
loyalty, and in this situation there are no reasons that would prove that [a] one-day delay in
presenting the copies of insurance policies by the claimant was so essential a threat for the
obliged party that it justified the use by the obliged party of its right to immediately terminate
the agreements in a situation where the provisions of these agreements proved that the
parties’ will was guaranteeing the validity of the agreements for longer period of time (so
called guaranteed periods).!”

 

    
 
  

180. Claimant admits that the Court of Appeal later lifted the injunctive relief ordered in favour of
BH Travel by the first instance court because BH Travel, having lost possession of its stores, no
longer had standing to request injunctive relief.”

the Lease Agreements, there was no longer a good relationship between PPL and BH Travel. See Hearing

both injunction proceedings were conducted ex parte before the first instance court that granted
the injunctive relief, on appeal the Court of Appeal made its decisions after hearing both

facie basis, confirmed the invalidity of PPL’s termination of the Lease Agreements.

182. Furthermore, Claimant asserts that the Regional Court more recently stated that there was ample
evidence “in support of the terminations of the rental agreements being considered defective and
unlawful”

183. However, Respondent argues that the only judgment in a lawsuit between BH Travel and PPL
rendered to date was handed down by the Regional Court on 3 December 2014 and held that the
termination of the Lease Agreements was valid.”* The judgment of the Regional Court dated
25 February 2015, which Claimant refers to, was rendered in a case between PPL and Mr. Maciej
Dworniak over the protection of “PPL’s personal rights”. Respondent submits that the
25 February 2015 judgment has no binding effect between PPL and BH Travel in respect of the
validity of the termination of the Lease Agreements.”

184. Respondent adds that, although PPL based the termination of the Lease Agreements on
16 February 2012 solely on the two grounds stated above,””” Respondent submits that BH Travel
had breached the Lease Agreements on multiple occasions in the past and “from the very
beginning” of its business relationship with PPL, rendering BH Travel’s failure to perform the
Lease Agreements a “permanent condition”. Respondent contends that, due to BH Travel’s
continuing breaches, PPL’s right of early termination of the Lease Agreements was “repeated”
several times throughout the life of these Agreements.”

185. Respondent clarifies that BH Travel had already significantly delayed the submission of renewed
bank guarantees in 2010 and 2011.7° Respondent further contends that BH Travel had missed a
deadline in December 2009 to submit new insurance policies and had once, in 2011, submitted
electronic copies of the insurance policies only and submitted true copies only after the applicable
deadline.”"!

186. Respondent also contends that, in the two years preceding the termination of the Lease
Agreements on 16 February 2012, BH Travel’s debt was “as much as between Hi and ; |

length of time when BH Travel was in arrears varied from several days to several hundred days.”

187. Respondent further submits that BH Travel had previously not complied with the requirements
of revenue reporting under Paragraph 3(1)(b) of the Lease Agreements and Article 5(12)(a) of
the General Lease Conditions.’'* Respondent adds that BH Travel failed to perform certain
marketing obligations (such as establishing a website with certain features),”'* failed to supply
its shops adequately with merchandise,”"* and failed to perform the necessary adaption works at
the leased premises.”"”

188. Claimant asserts that any purported breaches apart from the grounds for the termination of the
Lease Agreements as mentioned in Respondent’s notice of termination dated 16 February 2012
are “entirely irrelevant’. Claimant submits that BH Travel’s payment arrears never exceeded the
permissible two-month grace period for payment delays and thus did not reach the threshold to
justify a termination of the Lease Agreements under Article 13 of the General Lease
Conditions.”"*

189. Claimant also submits that BH Travel’s past failures to timely provide bank guarantees in 2010
were due to problems with cash-flow that had later been resolved. Claimant highlights that
BH Travel had furnished the required bank guarantees for all of its premises until 31 March 2012.
Moreover, regarding the submission of insurance policies, Claimant emphasises that the
insurance policies it had previously provided were valid and in effect at and beyond the date of
the termination of the Lease Agreements in February 2012. Claimant states that Respondent’s
complaint about having at first received the policies by way of e-mail only was a mere
technicality — one that Respondent had never complained of before.”

 

190. In brief, Claimant submits that Respondent’s allegation of accounting failures and other breaches
in the course of BH Travel’s business operations do not go beyond minor issues typical of normal
business dealings.””°

and the withdrawal of BH Travel’s duty-free permits."

192. By letter dated 22 February 2012, BH Travel (through Mr. Kazimierski as a newly appointed
member of its Management Board) informed PPL that BH Travel considered the notices of
termination to be “ineffective” and to be lacking any “legal or factual basis,” as well as that PPL’s
actions were “unlawful” in light of the continuing validity of the Lease Agreements.”

193. BH Travel called on PPL “to enter into negotiations by 24 February 2012 in order to make the
necessary changes to the Lease Agreements, so as to allow PPL to proceed with the venture in
accordance with the law”. BH Travel further affirmed its willingness to enter into a settlement
and to “terminate the court proceedings initiated to enforce the rights of BH Travel”.

194. PPL responded by letter on 23 February 2012, averring that the Lease Agreements were lawfully
and effectively terminated with immediate effect. PPL further demanded that BH Travel
“forthwith close and discontinue” its business activity in Chopin Airport and vacate the premises
by the deadlines indicated in the Lease Agreements. In case of delay, PPL maintained “the right
to demand from BH Travel [...] the payment of contractual penalties”.’”*

195. On 24 February 2012, the District Court of Warsaw (“District Court”) granted BH Travel’s
request for an injunction ordering PPL to provide BH Travel’s employees access to the stores in
the DFZ. The same day, counsel for BH Travel asked PPL to reopen BH Travel’s stores in Chopin
Airport and to comply with the District Court’s order by giving access to their employees so that
BH Travel could resume operations in Chopin Airport.??>

 

 

196. On 15 March 2012, the District Court expanded the scope of its injunction and ordered PPL to
permit BH Travel to sell goods in its stores at Chopin Airport and to use its information
technology systems during its normal course of business.””°

 

197. On the next day, BH Travel renewed its request that PPL open all of BH Travel’s stores and
permit it to sell goods in those stores. BH Travel also reiterated that PPL’s failure to do otherwise
would violate the District Court’s injunction.”

198. Respondent highlights that the Regional Court overruled the District Court’s 24 February 2012
order on 13 September 2012. Respondent also notes that the District Court’s 24 February 2012
order had “refused to secure BH Travel’s claims to prevent PPL from starting the modernization
of Terminal 1”,°* Claimant maintains that the District Court’s order was only set aside because
the injunctive relief intended to protect BH Travel’s possession of the stores had become moot
after BH Travel’s eviction.*”

 

199. On 16 March 2012, BH Travel requested from the Director of the Customs Chamber that the
official seals affixed by the customs officers on BH Travel’s stores be removed.” The customs
authorities then reopened all of BH Travel’s stores on the same day.”!

200. PPL threatened to draw on BH Travel’s bank guarantees if the leased premises were not returned
by 17 March 2012.7”

201. Thus, on 17 and 18 March 2012, BH Travel relinquished five of the leased premises (Baltona
Perfumery, Baltona Bestseller, Baltona Kid’s World, Baltona Esprit, and Baltona Arrival). The
handover protocols, signed by Mr. Kazimierski, explain that BH Travel was “forced to release
the premises”.** Nonetheless, BH Travel decided to remain in possession of Baltona Airport
Shop, Baltona Accessories, and Baltona Classic, as well as of its Warehouse and Social Rooms,
in order to preserve some leverage in future negotiations with PPL.

 

202. On 19 and 21 March 2012, BH Travel attempted to deliver goods to its stores Baltona Accessories
and Baltona Classic.?*> According to Claimant, the goods passed customs controls, but when BH
Travel presented the goods for “routine security checks”, the officers of the Airport Protection
Guard refused to inspect the goods because of “direct instructions” from PPL.*°

203. Respondent contends that refusal to admit the goods concerned only a “single delivery of the
same goods” on 19 and 21 March 2012 and that the refusal was caused by BH Travel’s failure to
comply with the formalities for delivery (i.e., one day’s advance notification of the delivery).?*”
However, Claimant submits that PPL had previously accepted same-day notifications and that its

goods were not allowed to pass security even after timely notification on 21 March 2012 and on
at least one further occasion.”

204. A notary public, summoned at the request of BH Travel, witnessed and recorded the incident. He
observed that ; | Mr. [PN] and his assistant, : | Ms. [IM], were called to the security control
area to resolve the dispute. According to Claimant, ; | Mr. [PN] declared that the goods only
could be delivered if a court officer intervened.” In his testi before the
Tribunal, ; | Mr. [PN] disputed the veracity of the notary public’s report, and considered that,
“written one-sidedly by BH Travel persons and the notary public, the report present[ed] their

viewpoints on the events”. For Claimant, the refusal to admit BH Travel’s goods clearly
2a

  

 

violated court-ordered injunctions.

205. On 21 March 2012, PPL requested the handover of the premises remaining in BH Travel’s
possession under an accelerated enforcement, without examination of the merits.“? On 23 March
2012, BH Travel, unable to operate the store, returned the premises of the Baltona Classic store
to PPL “under protest” to mitigate damages.”"? However, on 6 April 2012, the District Court
dismissed PPL’s motions for accelerated enforcement because the statutory requirements had not
been complied with.“

206. Thereafter, on 4 May 2012, PPL inspected the “security” at BH Travel’s premises upon notice of
one business day. It claimed that the inspections revealed defects in BH Travel’s electricity
installations and requested that those defects be remedied within three days.* Respondent
submits that the security inspections were regular and of a “routine nature” and fell within PPL’s
responsibility under the relevant regulations.“

207. PPL disconnected electric supply to BH Travel’s stores even after the District Court ordered that
PPL restore power.”’ Respondent submits that PPL, as an energy company under the Polish
energy law, was entitled to cut off electricity since BH Travel was in payment arrears and had
been given a two-week deadline to pay for the electricity."**

Administrative proceedings regarding the termination of the Lease Agreements

208. On 14 May 2012, PPL requested the Governor of Mazovia to approve the implementation of the
modernisation of Terminal 1 pursuant to the Airport Act. PPL moreover requested the Governor
to “declare the immediate enforceability of his decision” pursuant to Article 26 of the Airport
Act.” This request was submitted without BH Travel’s knowledge, but Respondent submits that
BH Travel was not made a party to these proceedings due to a lack of standing: the Lease
Agreements conferred only contractual rights, but no property or other perpetual rights upon
BH Travel.**°

209. PPL requested the Governor of Mazovia on 11 June 2012 to approve the modernisation of
Terminal 1 “as soon as possible but in any event no later than by the end of June 2012”. PPL
requested accelerated proceedings because of “currently held tender proceedings for the selection
of the contractor and the terms of the realization of the investment which assume that the
preparatory works shall commence on | August 2012 and that the investment itself shall be
implemented as of | September 2012”.**!

210. On 10 July 2012, the Governor of Mazovia granted PPL permission to execute the proposed
modernisation and declared his decision immediately enforceable.** However, Claimant notes
that the decision did not specify the affected premises or order their immediate surrender, on the
basis that PPL had failed to apply for the seizure of those premises.”

211. PPL requested the Governor of Mazovia on 19 July 2012 to confirm the immediate enforceability
of his 10 July 2012 decision and the legal consequences of that decision, including the obligation
to vacate the affected premises. In a decision on 24 July 2012, the Governor of Mazovia ordered
the immediate handover of the affected premises, but Claimant notes that, again, the Governor
did not specify the affected premises.*™

212. On 26 July 2012, the Governor of Mazovia notified BH Travel of the 24 July 2012 decision and
ordered BH Travel to return the premises for Baltona Accessories and Baltona Airport Shop to
PPL within seven business days. The notice further indicated that “enforcement proceedings”

Exhibit C-57. Article 3 of the Airport Act required the Governor of Mazovia to issue a decision within 3
months of the request, while Article 26(1) empowered the Governor to declare “immediate enforceability” of
his decision if there was an “underlying social or economic interest”. Article 26(2) provided that immediate
enforceability would entitle the applicant to commence construction, to compel immediate release of affected
premises, and to take possession of those premises regardless of any pending appeal. (Statement of Claim,

would be initiated if the premises were not vacated by the deadline.”**

213. By a decision of 7 August 2012, the Governor of Mazovia ordered BH Travel to vacate its
remaining premises in Terminal | prior to 13 August 2012 or “enforcement measures will be
applied in [the] form of forcible taking over of the premises on 14" August 2012 at 09:00 AM”.
On 13 August 2012, Claimant and BH Travel filed several objections to the scheduled evictions,
which were summarily dismissed by the enforcement officers.?*°

214. On 14 August 2012, BH Travel was evicted from the remaining premises in the presence of
Messrs. Uryga and Kruszewski, as well as lawyers for BH Travel, PPL, and the Governor of
Mazovia.”*’ Respondent notes that the Governor also initiated enforcement proceedings against
other entities that had premises in Terminal 1, although those entities voluntarily vacated the
premises.”**

215. An appeal from BH Travel against the Governor of Mazovia’s decision with the Minister of
Transport was dismissed on 13 November 2012 on the ground that BH Travel, having no vested
property rights “to the real property covered by the planned investment”, was not a qualified
party to the proceedings.”*°

216. BH Travel appealed the Minister of Transport’s decision to the Administrative Court in Warsaw
(“Administrative Court”), but the court rejected that appeal on 25 April 2013 and affirmed the
Minister of Transport’s findings.”

217. BH Travel further appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court of Poland (“Supreme
Administrative Court”), which denied BH Travel’s appeal on 28 November 2013 and affirmed
the findings of the first instance court that BH Travel did not have status as a party to the
proceedings before the Governor of Mazovia.”*!

Negotiations after the termination of the Lease Agreements

218. After PPL terminated the Lease Agreements and before BH Travel’s eviction from Chopin
Airport on 14 August 2012, Claimant and its subsidiaries attempted to negotiate with PPL and
other relevant government officials to reach an amicable settlement.”

219. On 21 February 2012, Baltona (Messrs. Maciej Dworniak and Wojciech Kruk) met with PPL

(Messrs. : | [MM] and ; | [PN]) to discuss PPL’s termination of the Lease Agreements. After
the meeting, Baltona wrote to PPL to: (i) confirm its “good will” in assisting PPL’s expansion
and development of Chopin Airport; (ii) commit to “abstain from any action which would hinder

 

the performance of the modernization of Terminal 1”; and (iii) emphasise the urgent need for
263

negotiations.”

220. PPL confirmed however on 23 February 2012 that the termination of the Lease Agreements was
effective and “categorically refused to engage in any ‘amicable resolution of the existing
dispute””. It moreover cancelled the follow-up meeting scheduled for 24 February 2012 to “avoid
insinuation [...] that PPL deemed the claims by BH Travel as justified”?

221. On 24 February 2012, Mr. Dworniak of Baltona and Mr. Tadeusz Jarmuziewicz, the Polish
Deputy Minister for Transport, met Mr. Jarmuziewicz and “promised to assist in the resolution
of the dispute and to direct PPL to enter into negotiations with Baltona and BH Travel”.?°
Claimant submits that Mr. Jarmuziewicz did not follow up on that promise.”°°

222. However, on 24 February 2012, Claimant also sent a letter to Stawomir Nowak, the Polish
Minister of Transport, thereby initiating the dispute settlement procedure under Article 9 of the
Treaty.267

223. On 27 February 2012, the Baltona Supervisory Board unsuccessfully appealed to various high-
ranking Polish officials, including the Minister of Transport, for assistance in resolving the
dispute.” In letters dated 21 March 2012 and 26 July 2012, BH Travel reiterated its request that
the Minister of Transport supervise the PPL General Director, ; | Mr. [MM]’s actions pursuant
to Articles 51 and 53 of the PPL Act.” The Minister of Transport did not respond to that
request.?”

224. Hi Mr. [MM] agreed to meet with Mr. Ahuja on 19 July 2012. For Mr. Ahuja, “[t]he purpose of
that meeting was to gauge PPL’s approach to the ongoing dispute and to find common grounds

which could form the basis for a constructive settlement”.””' According to Mr. Ahuja, the parties
agreed to discuss the terms of a settlement in further working group meetings because [i Mr.
[MM] seemed “open to a negotiated settlement”.?”

225. The working group first met on 27 July 2012. For BH Travel, a settlement should include an
extension of the Lease Agreements for a period equivalent to the duration of Terminal 1’s
operational shutdown, as well as the reinstatement of its leases in Terminal 2, which were
unaffected by the modernisation. BH Travel also requested that the guaranteed periods be
extended as compensation for the closure of the stores. PPL’s position was that the termination
of the Lease Agreements was effective and that BH Travel should immediately hand over the
remaining premises in Terminal 1. PPL further agreed that the parties should conclude new lease
agreements for the same stores.?”>

226. Counsel for BH Travel sent PPL a draft settlement agreement on | August 2012 reflecting the
terms discussed during the 27 July 2012 meeting. PPL circulated its comments on that draft on
10 August 2012 whereby PPL insisted that the conclusion of new lease agreements could not be
part of the settlement. Such agreements could only be concluded after the execution of any
settlement, and were further subject to the Minister of the State Treasury’s approval.’

227. After another meeting on 21 August 2012, PPL sent a further draft on 28 August 2012 on which
BH Travel commented the same day. PPL did not reply to those comments.?”>

Vv. JURISDICTION
1) Whether Claimant is an ‘Investor’ under the Treaty
228. Article 1(2) of the Treaty provides that:

The term “Investors” refers with regard to either Contracting Party to:

(a) natural persons having the nationality of the Contracting Party under the law in force of
that Contracting Party;

(b) legal entities, including companies, corporations, firms and business associations
incorporated or constituted or established under the law of a Contracting Party.

Respondent's Position

229. Respondent submits that Claimant cannot be an ‘investor’ as it has not made an ‘investment’
within the meaning of the Treaty (see paras. 258-263 below).?” Respondent explains that, under
bilateral investment treaties, an entity can only be considered an ‘investor’ if it satisfies the
nationality requirement and “at the same time” makes an investment in good faith in the host

country in the meaning of the treaty. While Respondent does not dispute that Claimant is a
company founded under Indian law, Respondent does contest that Claimant’s compliance with
the condition of ‘nationality’ is concurrent with its compliance with the condition of making an
investment in Poland.”””

230. Respondent further submits that Claimant cannot be considered to be an ‘investor’ within the
meaning of the Treaty in light of its “intermediate position in the structure of the Flemingo Group,
in the case of the activities specified by the Claimant as its investment”.°* In this regard,
Respondent states that Claimant has presented an “incomplete and selective structure of its
group”, meaning that there “are serious and reasonable doubts as to how the holding structure of
the Flemingo Group actually looks”. In any event, Respondent submits, “it is certain” that
Claimant is neither the “ultimate beneficiary of the Flemingo Group [...] nor the direct owner of
Baltona’s stock”, and allowing such an entity to pursue claims under the Treaty would amount
to an abuse of the mechanism.””

231.

Respondent submits that the “ultimate determining factor as to whether someone is an investor
is the literal wording of the specific bilateral investment treaty”; however, “in the absence of the
detailed premises required to settle the emerging doubts, the tribunal needs to resort to the theory

and definition constructed by case law and jurisprudence”.?*°

232. In respect of case law and theory, Respondent states that these “are either based on the theory
that assumes that only the ultimate owner may be the investor or on the theory that the investor
is only the direct owner of the stocks or shares”.”*!

233. Respondent refers to the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), which contains a
denial-of-benefits clause, Ludi NAFTA’s substantive protections “if investors of a
non-Party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial business activities
[...]”. Accordingly, Respondent states, NAFTA only grants protection to the ultimate
beneficiary.”

 

234. Respondent claims that arbitral awards have adopted a similar position based on the assumption
that the actual investor is the entity which is the ultimate beneficiary of the investment, referring
to SOABI v. Senegal (where, Respondent states, “the tribunal decided to perform the test of the
final beneficiary (beneficial ownership/ultimate beneficiary) and on this bi decided on its
jurisdiction”), and to Sedelmayer v. Russian Federation and Société Générale v. The
Dominican Republic (where, Respondent explains, the tribunals pointed to the final beneficiary,

rather than the intermediate entity, when assessing who exactly the investor was).?*4 Respondent

further submits that there have been many occasions where arbitral tribunals have indicated that
there is a “cut-off” point where an entity in the holding group is too far removed to be said to

have made the investment.”

235. Respondent avers that there is also a line of judgments (based on the ICSID Convention)

specifying that, when determining ‘nationality’, “attention should be paid only to the direct owner
of the investment”, referring to Tokios Tokelés v. Ukraine and Amco v. Indonesia in support.*°

236. Respondent asserts that the investment in the present case was “an indirect investment made by
Flemingo International (registered in the Virgin Islands, with its headquarters in Dubai)” and not
by Claimant, noting that “strictly speaking, it was Culex, which is a subsidiary of Ashdod, which
in turn, is owned by Flemingo International, that made investment in Poland”.”*” Respondent
describes the course of the transaction of the acquisition of Baltona’s stock as follows:

In the first instance, Culex (a company not directly from the Flemingo Group structure),
acquired 26.83% of Baltona’s stock from the State Treasury (of Poland). Next, Culex
acquired 59.94% of Baltona’s stock from Alfa Center. Culex transferred Baltona’s stock
which it acquired to Ashdod, a Cypriot law company belonging to the Flemingo Group,
under three agreements. Finally, in the middle of 2010, Ashdod acquired 12.5% of Baltona’s
stocks from PPL, becoming its almost 100% owner.

The Claimant's only role in the transaction described above of the acquisition of Baltona’s
stock was to issue a corporate guarantee for Culex in the transaction on the acquisition of
the stock from Alfa Center. The settlements regarding the acquisition of Baltona’s stock by
Culex from Alfa Center are the subject of litigation to this day [...].28*

  

237. Respondent points out that, for Claimant, “because Ashdod is within the structure of the
Flemingo Group, its investment is also an investment of the Claimant, which is also a part of this

group”.”* Although Respondent acknowledges that this position “in certain cases [...] can prove
to be correct”, in the circumstances of the present case, the investment made cannot be construed
as being Claimant’s investment.”

238. Respondent explains that the acquisition of Baltona shares cannot be Claimant’s investment as it
did not participate financially in the process of the acquisition”! Although Claimant was within
the Flemingo Group structure at the time, “it was neither directly related to Flemingo
International, nor was it a parent company of Flemingo International or its owners”. Respondent
submits that Claimant has never conducted and does not conduct any business in Poland, and
adds that it was not until March 2011 that Claimant acquired the shares in Flemingo
International.” Respondent asserts that, during the acquisition of Baltona’s stock, another entity

from the Flemingo Group, Flemingo International, was operating and presenting itself as the new

entity controlling Baltona,”*? for instance by lending funds to Culex to acquire the Baltona stock
belonging to Poland.” Furthermore, Respondent argues that it was Flemingo International which
performed the ownership functions with respect to Baltona.?°

 

239. Respondent notes the various grounds on which Claimant bases its contention that it was involved
in the acquisition and management of Baltona and BH Travel, namely that: (i) it had seconded
its managers to the authorities of BH Travel and Baltona; (ii) it had given Alfa Center a corporate
guarantee in connection with the acquisition of Baltona’s shares by Culex; and (iii) it had issued
a ‘letter of comfort’ and a guarantee on the loan from the State Bank of India branch in Dubai to
Flemingo International in Dubai.”

240. In respect of the first ground, Respondent states that the managers in question (Messrs. Atul
Ahuja, Mahandra Thakar, and Rasiklal Thakker) are involved as shareholders or directors of
several dozen entities, and therefore “it is difficult to justify the argument that they constituted
significant personnel resources of precisely Flemingo DutyFree”.””’ Respondent adds that, of the
persons who allegedly played an active part on behalf of Claimant in improving BH Travel’s

Baltona’s business, only Mr. Mahandra Thakar had been presented to PPL.”

241. With respect to the second ground, Respondent points out that that Claimant in all events failed
to honor the alleged guarantee to Alpha Center for Culex’s acquisition of its Baltona’s shares,
and denies any liability under the guarantee. Moreover, Respondent argues, even if it were
accepted that Claimant effectively guaranteed Culex’s obligations to Alfa Center, this does not
make Claimant an ‘investor’ in Poland as the possibility of any spending under the guarantee
remains “purely hypothetical”.

242. With regard to the third ground, Respondent states that the ‘letter of comfort’ is no evidence that
Claimant is an ‘investor’. Respondent submits that this letter had to support the loan granted by
the State Bank of India to Flemingo International to finance the purchase of the Polish company;
it was Flemingo International who was the investor and borrower. Claimant’s guarantee had only
a “secondary and supporting role in the investment made by Flemingo International”. Besides,
Respondent notes that Claimant was only one of numerous guarantors of the loan, and that part
of the loan was assigned for the purchase of Baltona.*” Respondent adds that the internal
financial flows within the Flemingo Group cannot make Claimant an investor “because there is
a lack of an element of a so-called investment risk which is necessary to be able to consider such
an activity an investment”!

243. With regard to Claimant’s assertions that it allegedly granted loans to Flemingo International in
July 2012, Respondent considers this “irrelevant to the present case” because: (i) there is no
evidence of the financial flows; and (ii) the alleged loans were granted two and a half years after
the Baltona shares were acquired and even after the dispute arose”

244. In the structure of the Flemingo Group, Respondent argues, “a number of other entities are
positioned above the Claimant, inter alia Flemingo International (BVI), Commodities Services
International, and Sapphaire International Limited”. It concludes that “[o]nly Flemingo
International (and its parent entities or its direct subsidiaries) can be recognized as [...] an

investor” For Respondent, within the Flemingo Group, Claimant was only chosen to initiate

the present proceedings as it has been registered in the Republic of India, which has signed a
bilateral investment treaty with Poland (see paras. 272-278 below). Respondent notes that another
entity in the Flemingo Group (Ashdod), with registered offices in Cyprus (another country with
which Poland has signed a bilateral investment treaty) had also submitted a notice of arbitration
against Poland.**

For Respondent, “the subsequent change in the [Flemingo Group’s] structure” should not
constitute grounds for admitting Claimant as an ‘investor’ as “Claimant has not proved in any
way that any financial flows took place with the change in the structure of the Flemingo
Group”.*

Respondent concludes that the purpose and intention of the signatories is instrumental to the
accurate interpretation of the BIT and what constitutes an investor.*”° According to Respondent:
(i) the clear wording of the preamble of the Poland-India BIT (“[...] Desiring to create conditions
favourable for fostering investment by investors of one State in the territory of another State”);
(ii) the fact the India is currently working on a Draft Model BIT that will limit protection to
investors who have a substantial business presence in the territory; and (iii) the legal and
economic environment of Poland at the signing of the treaty; all evidence that the signatory States
did not anticipate that the BIT would be “abused” by “multi-layer tax optimisation structures”.*”

Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that under the “broad” definition of ‘investor’ in Article 1(2)(b) of the Treaty,
which covers any legal entities and includes companies established or incorporated under the
laws of either Contracting Party to the Treaty, Flemingo DutyFree (Claimant) “falls squarely”
within the definition of ‘investor’.*” In this regard, Claimant observes that Respondent does not
dispute that Claimant (Flemingo DutyFree) is a company incorporated under Indian law, or that
it complied with all of the procedural requirements under Article 9 of the Treaty.*”

Claimant denies Respondent’s contention that the position of Flemingo DutyFree within the

Alfa-Center and Culex dated 30 March 2010; Exhibit C-133 (evidencing that Claimant provided two
guarantees to Culex, and did not perform its obligations); Loan Agreement between Flemingo International

Flemingo Group structure is relevant to the definition of an ‘investor’ under the Treaty.*!”

249. Claimant argues that it is widely accepted that BIT contracting parties have a great latitude and
flexibility to determine the criteria for corporate nationality and notes that Respondent concedes
that the “plain wording” of the Treaty is the “ultimate determining factor as to whether someone
is an investor”.*!' Accordingly, Claimant asserts, Respondent’s argument fails because the
“broad” definition in Article 1(2) of the Treaty does not contain the limitations that Respondent
seeks to read into it, 7.e., that the investor must be the “first foreign entity in the hierarchy” or the
“beneficial owner/ultimate beneficiary”.* "Tn addition, Claimant submits that the Treaty contains
none of the limitations on the categories of ‘investors’ that could have been included by the
Treaty’s Contracting Parties.*'> Rather, the Treaty, like many other investment treaties, defines
corporate investors simply by reference to the State of incorporation.** Accordingly, the Tribunal
cannot be asked to read into the Treaty limitations to which the Contracting Parties did not

agree.?!

250. Claimant argues that Respondent’s “restricted interpretation” cannot be justified in light of the
Treaty’s object and purpose to “create conditions favourable for fostering greater investment by
investors of one State in the territory of the other” and to ensure “the encouragement and
reciprocal protection under international agreement of such investment”.*'® Claimant notes that

prior tribunals, including Tokios Tokelés and Société Générale v. Philippines, have “interpreted
virtually identical language in treaty preambles as indicating the parties’ intention to provide
broad protection to investors and their investments, and found on this basis that a restrictive
reading of jurisdictional requirements could not be justified”"’ Claimant also submits that prior
tribunals, including Tokios Tokelés and Rompetrol v. Romania, have confirmed that it is
inappropriate to impose limitations on the scope of an investment treaty beyond those set out in
the text of the treaty itself.*!*

251. Claimant denies Respondent’s assertion that case law is “either based on the theory that assumes
that only the ultimate owner may be the investor or on the theory that the investor is the only
direct owner of the stocks or shares”.*!? In response, Claimant asserts that “[n]umerous tribunals
in investment treaty arbitration have readily accepted that intermediate entities in a holding
structure can qualify as investors”, referring to ConocoPhilips v. Venezuela and CEMEX v.
Venezuela as support.” Claimant further dismisses Respondent's reliance on the “denial of
benefits” clause in NAFTA as being “wholly misplaced”, because the India-Poland Treaty
contains no such clause or comparable limitation”!

252. In addition, Claimant submits that none of the cases cited by Respondent support its position that
only the “ultimate beneficiary” or the “direct owner” of the shares in a locally-incorporated
company can bring treaty claims against the host State.>” In this regard, Claimant argues that
neither Sedelmayer nor Société Générale v. The Dominican Republic turned on the question of
whether the claimants in those cases were the final or ultimate beneficiary as Respondent alleges.
Rather, Claimant argues, the claimants in those cases were found to be investors under the
relevant treaties by virtue of having the required nationalities”?

253. Further, Claimant submits that SOAB/ and Amco are “inapposite authorities” for Respondent
because they concerned the interpretation of the requirement of “foreign control” under the
ICSID Convention, which does not apply to this proceeding.* Furthermore, Claimant states that

neither Amco nor Tokios Tokelés supports Respondent’s arguments. This is because the tribunal
in Amco did accept jurisdiction over claims by an intermediate entity,’?* and the tribunal in Tokios
Tokelés did not even consider the question of whether an intermediate entity could be an
‘investor’. The Tokios Tokelés tribunal also held that the treaty’s object and purpose of providing
broad protection to investors and investments made it inappropriate to limit the scope of
‘investor’ to the ultimate controlling party.

254. Claimant also disagrees with Respondent’s approach to the two ‘investor’ and ‘investment’
requirements under the Treaty, stating that Respondent “wrongly conflates” these two distinct
requirements — “with the result that [...] its analysis fails”.*?” In any event, Claimant submits, it
has made an ‘investment’ protected by the Treaty (see paras. 264-271 below).

 

255. Finally, Claimant dismisses Respondent’s allegation that Flemingo DutyFree has presented an
“incomplete and selective structure of its group” and that there are “doubts as to how the holding
structure [...] actually looks”, stating that the assertion is wrong and legally irrelevant.°*
Claimant responds that it has “laid bare the structure of its shareholding in BH Travel, as well as
that of its own shareholders” and that the only “legally relevant” aspect of its corporate structure
is the evidence of its indirect shareholding in BH Travel (for the purposes of determining whether
it has made an ‘investment’ protected under the Treaty).°?°

256. Claimant further addresses Respondent’s argument that two entities within the same group
(Ashdod and Flemingo DutyFree) could not be in a position to bring treaty claims. Claimant
states that this view is contradicted by case law as well as the terms of the Treaty, as confirmed,
inter alia, by ConocoPhilips and Cemex. In the latter case, Claimant submits, the tribunal
accepted jurisdiction over claims by multiple Dutch companies from the same group.**” In any
event, Claimant states that Ashdod has not launched any arbitration claim against Respondent.*

(c) rights to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value;

(d) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes and know-how in accordance
with the relevant laws of the respective Contracting Party;

(c) business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search
for and extract oil and other minerals.

Respondent's Position

Respondent denies that Claimant has an ‘investment’ under the Treaty. Respondent argues that
the examples of ‘investments’ specified by Claimant do not meet the generally accepted
additional requirements for an investment to be protected, namely: (i) a substantial commitment;
(ii) significance for the host State’s development; (iii) regularity of profit and return; and (iv) an
element of risk on both sides.**

 

Respondent first denies that Claimant has an ‘investment’ through its acquisition of stock in
Baltona (which in turn owned 100% of the shares in BH Travel), on the basis that Claimant is
not the ultimate beneficiary in the Flemingo Group and “did not participate in the process of
acquiring Baltona’s stock (see paras. 229-246 above).*** Respondent also submits that, even if
the purchase of the shares in Baltona was a real investment, “the Flemingo Group still owns

shares in Baltona and therefore there was no expropriation”. >*

 

Respondent also denies that Claimant held an ‘investment’ in the form of a “cone
operating at Chopin Airport.** Specifically, Respondent argues that Baltona never received any
concession which could be considered a business concession in the meaning of the Treaty, stating
that it was erroneous to view the permit for conducting business in the DFZ of Chopin Airport as
a concession.**° In this regard Respondent submits that a “typical” element of a business
concession referred to in the Treaty is that it is granted by the State, and applies to activities in
areas that are key to the State’s security.*” Respondent denies that any concession was granted
by the State, and stresses that the issuance of a permit to operate within the DFZ from the customs
office was “secondary and depended on BH Travel winning the tender” awarded by PPL.***

 

 

Respondent notes that although Claimant does not refer to Article 1(1)(d) of the Treaty, Claimant
has used the term “valuable concessions”, which “creates the false impression that the Lease
Agreements were something more than normal civil-law agreements of a purely contractual
nature”.*? Respondent further submits that “Claimant is equating [...] lease agreements as

concessions for public construction works”.™” In this regard, Respondent argues that the term
“concession” in the Treaty should be interpreted in accordance with the Polish Business Freedom
Act, which was already in force at the time that the Treaty was enacted.*4! The procedure for
awarding a concession, Respondent submits, is usually formalised and conducted in an
administrative procedure which ends with an administrative decision. In the current

 

circumstances, Respondent argues, the Lease Agreements were agreed pursuant to a private
tender,“ which cannot be construed as an administrative procedure or decision.*? Respondent
emphasises that the use of the term “concession” by the Parties in prior documentation and
discussion “is of no significance”.

Respondent denies further that the Lease Agreements themselves could constitute an
‘investment’ for Claimant, as they were concluded by BH Travel before the acquisition of
Baltona by the Flemingo Group, and therefore were “at most, an integral part of BH Travel’s
business”.** Respondent adds that lease agreements are “not contained within the category of
investments specified in Article 1(1)” of the Treaty, and further do not satisfy the additional
requirements set forth at paragraph 258 above.*°

Respondent explains its position stating that the Lease Agreements “could not have constituted
either a significant or lasting element of Baltona’s property”, since they were “only part of many
lease agreements which Baltona concluded directly or through its subsidiaries”.*4” Respondent
also observes that, from the time of acquisition of Baltona’s shares to December 2014, Baltona’s
operations increased by over two times notwithstanding the termination of the Lease
Agreements.“

Claimant’s Position

Claimant states that its “investment for the purposes of this arbitration consists of its indirect
controlling shareholding in BH Travel and all rights associated therewith”. Claimant submits
that Article 1(1) of the Treaty provides an “expansive” definition of the term ‘investment’ as well
as a non-exhaustive list of examples.** It is "widely accepted” in investment treaty jurisprudence,
Claimant avers, that indirect investments such as shares held through intermediary companies are
a protected form of investment if there are no limitations in the applicable definition of an
‘investment’ .**! Claimant notes that there is no such limitation in the Treaty in the present case,

and accordingly submits that its indirect shareholding in BH Travel (which in turn held rights to
a concession for commercial space in Terminals 1 and 2) qualifies as a protected investment
under the Treaty.>°?

265. Claimant argues that Respondent’s objection that the investment has to satisfy additional
premi: is “entirely inappropriate in view of the clear and unambiguous language” of the
Treaty.**3 Moreover, Claimant submits that this objection “is based on a flawed application of
outdated criteria relating to the interpretation of a different treaty [i.e., the ICSID treaty]”.**

  
  

266. Even if those additional requirements needed to be met (which Claimant denies), Claimant
contends that its investment does satisfy these criteria as it made a “substantial investment of
capital (and took on a substantial element of risk)” by: (i) investing USD 26,505,000 to acquire
its controlling stake in Baltona and BH Travel, which in turn held rights to a concession for
duty-free stores in Terminals 1 and 2 of the Chopin Airport; (ii) undertaking to grant two
guarantees to support Culex’s acquisition of Alfa-~Center’s stake in Baltona; (iii) providing letters
of comfort, guarantees and loans to enable Flemingo International to raise financing to purchase
the shares in Baltona; and (iv) committing know-how through directors to ensure BH travel
become a “healthy and profitable business” leading to regular profit and return***

267. Claimant submits that its “indirect shareholding in BH Travel constitutes an ‘investment’ within
the meaning of Article 1(1)(b)” of the Treaty, as it falls within the definition of “shares in and
stock and debentures of a company and any other similar forms of participation in a company”.>*
Claimant asserts that investment treaty tribunals have “long recognized that indirect investments
such as shares through intermediary companies are protected forms of investment, even absent
explicit language in a treaty’s definition of ‘investment’,” citing Siemens v. Argentina, Mobil v.
Venezuela, Enron v. Argentina, Azurix v. Argentina, and Société Générale v. The Dominican
Republic as support.**” Furthermore, Claimant maintains that many tribunals have held that
investments acquired by a third party outside the territory of the host State also constitute
protected investments.***

268. In response to Respondent’s criticism that it was Flemingo International (and not Claimant) that
was the initial bidder for the State Treasury’s stock in Baltona, Claimant observes that the Treaty
specifically includes “acquired” assets, and so transfers among members of the same group do

treaty protection to investors who acquire shares in an existing company after the initial
investment has been made, including the tribunals in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, Teco v.
Guatemala, and Guaracachi v. Bolivia.*® Claimant similarly dismisses Respondent's criticism
that it does not conduct business in Poland, stating that “[t]ribunals have regularly exercised
jurisdiction over claims even where claimants have been passive members of a corporate
structure, citing Phoenix Action v. Czech Republic and Quasar de Valores v. Russia in support."
269. Claimant further submits that, in any event, it “heavily supported the initial purchases of shares
in Baltona” by: (i) providing a team to evaluate the investment; (ii) appointing its directors to
Baltona’s Supervisory Board; (iii) establishing the direct contacts with suppliers and distributors;
(iv) providing letters of comfort and guarantees for Flemingo International to obtain the necessary
funding; and (v) providing loans to Flemingo International.*

270. With respect to the Lease Agreements, Claimant maintains that these constitute protected
investments under Article 1(1) of the Treaty, because Claimant “is a controlling shareholder of
BH Travel [and accordingly] the protection under the BIT extends to the legal and contractual
rights of BH Travel including its lease agreements”.** This position, Claimant asserts, is
supported by investment treaty tribunal decisions such as Azurix v. Argentina, Vivendi I, and Pan
American v. Argentina> This protection is not affected, Claimant argues, by Respondent’s
objection that the Lease Agreements “were, at most, an integral part of BH Travel’s business” or
Respondent’s objection that the Lease Agreements were concluded before the acquisition of
Baltona by the Flemingo Group.

3) Whether Claimant has engaged in forum shopping

272.

273.

275.

276.

Respondent's Position

Respondent argues that Claimant does not deserve protection of the Treaty, as it has engaged in
forum shopping in the present case to find “a better plane for asserting its claims and avoiding
the local legal route”.*"’ Respondent summarises its position as follows:

The circumstance of these arbitration proceedings and, in particular, the submission of
notices of arbitration by both Ashdod and the Claimant, the secondary acquisition of the
shares in Flemingo International by the Claimant and the changes made in the Flemingo
Group’s capital structure after the acquisition of Baltona, unequivocally testify to the fact
that the Claimant took advantage of the so-called treaty shopping to artificially improve its
procedural position with respect to Respondent.

Respondent submits that the negative aspects of forum shopping, whereby entities try to benefit
from investment arbitration when they do not in fact have the right to initiate such proceedings,
is “widely recognised”, citing Saluka v. Czech Republic as support

Respondent states that its allegation of forum shopping is proved by the fact that a notice of
arbitration was submitted by two entities from the Flemingo Group (Ashdod and Claimant) both
registered in countries (Cyprus and India respectively) that have signed bilateral investment
treaties with Poland. The mostly likely explanation for this, Respondent argues, is that the
Flemingo Group was using these entities to “transfer the dispute to the international level” and
was making the decision as to which will be the ultimate claimant “contingent on the chances of
success of each”.*”

Respondent asserts that “only one forum is available in this case, which is the Polish judiciary”.
Respondent also indicates that parallel cases have been launched before the competent courts in
Poland, brought by PPL against BH Travel, and that they are “of a competitive nature with respect
to this arbitration” >”

Respondent submits that when negotiating the Treaty with Poland, India wanted to protect
investments made by entrepreneurs from India in Poland, and therefore protects entrepreneurs
who: (i) conduct real activity in India and pay taxes there; and (ii) make actual investments in
Poland. However the main financial flows within the Flemingo Group, Respondent argues, are
transferred through “tax havens” (Dubai or the British Virgin Islands) with Claimant in India
being only an “intermediary company” set up by Flemingo International BVI in 2003/2004 to
operate on the Indian market.>”!

3 Statement of Defence, paras. 271-272. Respondent states that damages claims against PPL were initiated in
June 2013 before Polish national Courts and explains that they relate to “the two profitable agreements” and
not to “all nine unprofitable agreements”. See Hearing Transcript (12 October 2015), 121:20 to 122:4.

37! Respondent’s Rejoinder, paras. 80 and 82.

277. Respondent argues that Baltona’s shares were acquired via “mailbox companies” with funds from
the tax havens, whereby Claimant’s commitment was limited to being one of many guarantors
for the funding loan and having some of its people (who worked also at Flemingo International)
involved in the transaction. Respondent argues further that Claimant has not provided proof that
it bore the cost of acquiring the shares in Flemingo International.>”

278. Respondent submits that both the EU and India have adopted the same position on the use of
“mailbox companies” or “shell companies”, namely that they should not benefit from the
protection provided for in investor-State dispute settlements (referring, inter alia, to recent EU
trade agreement negotiations and the new Draft Indian Model BIT).5”

Claimant’s Position

279. Claimant submits that “Respondent has failed to establish any legal basis for invoking ‘forum
shopping’ to object to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction”. Claimant dismisses Respondent’s reliance on
Saluka, because this decision “provides no support for the Respondent’s jurisdiction objection”.
In fact, in that case the Tribunal accepted jurisdiction over a Dutch company against the Czech
Republic as the company fell within the express terms of ‘investor’ as defined in the Netherlands-
Czech Republic bilateral investment treaty.” For Claimant, Saluka thus “only reaffirms the rule
that the definition of ‘investor’ should be interpreted in line with the BIT’s plain language”.>”>

280. Claimant observes that Respondent’s remark that the parallel proceedings conducted before the
Polish courts “are of a competitive nature” is baseless because the Treaty has no provision
requiring the exhaustion of local remedies. Claimant submits that parallel domestic proceedings
before domestic courts do not affect the jurisdiction of an investment treaty tribunal (unless the
treaty contains a fork-in-the-road provision), and observes that “much of the parallel litigation”
was initiated by PPL itself.”

281. Finally, Claimant denies Respondent’s assertion that it played no role in the acquisition of
Baltona, arguing that it had “played a central role in supporting the purchase of shares in Baltona
from the start of the due diligence process in February 2010, as confirmed by Mr. Ahuja’s

374 Claimant’s Reply, para. 185, referring to Saluka v. The Czech Republic Partial Award, p. 49, para. 241,
Exhibit CL-19, noting that the tribunal held: “the predominant factor which must guide the Tribunal’s
exercise of il the terms in which the parties to the Treaty now in question have agreed to establish
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. In the present context, that means the terms in which they have agreed upon who
an investor who may become a claimant is entitled to invoke the Treaty’s arbitration procedures. The parties
had complete freedom of choice in this matter, and they chose to limit entitled ‘investors’ to those satisfying
the definition set out in Article 1 of the Treaty. The Tribunal cannot in effect impose upon the parties a
definition of “investor” other than that which they themselves agreed. That agreed definition required only
that the claimant-investor should be constituted under the laws of [...] The Netherlands, and it is not open to
the Tribunal to add other requirements which the parties could themselves have added but which they omitted
to add” (emphasis added by Claimant).

testimony at the hearing.*”’ The restructuring by which Clamant acquired its indirect shareholding
in Baltona, Claimant submits, was conceived in the summer of 2009, was under way as early as
October 2010, and was completed by March 2011, before Respondent “began breaching the BIT
in February 2012 and thus well before any claim could have been perceived”.*”* The purpose of
the restructuring, Claimant maintains, was to consolidate the Flemingo Group’s corporate

structure.*”

4) Whether there is any basis to deny the protection of the Treaty to Claimant
Respondent's Position

282. Respondent submits that the “activities of the Flemingo Group were conducted in breach of the
fundamental principles of the law — in bad faith” and consequently “Claimant’s actions do not
deserve BIT Protection”.*°

283. Respondent alleges that after acquiring Baltona’s stock, being aware of its poor financial
condition, knowing BH Travel’s problems at Chopin Airport, and knowing that the Lease
Agreements may be terminated for noncompliance, “the Flemingo Group decided to take
advantage of the forthcoming modernization of Terminal | to achieve its specific business
objectives”. Respondent argues in this regard that the Flemingo Group used the business strategy
of initiating disputes to bring the modernisation of Terminal 1 to a stop, thereby forcing PPL to
enter into a compromise which would be advantageous for Claimant (for example by means of a
settlement) or fight for compensation allegedly owed to it.**!

 

284. Respondent emphasises that, under the Treaty, protection only applies to investments “[...]
established or acquired, in accordance with the national laws of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the investment is made” and “made [...] in accordance with its laws and regulations”.**
Respondent notes in this respect that under Article 5 of the Polish Civil Code “one may not use

his right in a manner which would be contrary to its social and economic purpose or to the
principles of community coexistence. Any such act or refraining from acting by the entitled
person shall not be treated as the exercise of the right and shall not be protected”.**?

285. Respondent submits that under the “prevailing mainstream case law” investors must meet two
requirements in respect of legality of investments: (i) to invest in compliance with domestic laws;
and (ii) to comply with general fundamental principles of the law, such as fraud, good faith, or
lack of corruption. Respondent further submits that arbitral tribunals, such as Gustav F Hamester
v. Republic of Ghana, and Phoenix Action (citing Inceyasa Vallisoletana v. Republic of El
Salvador), have confirmed that an investment made in breach of fundamental principles, as
Respondent maintains occurred in the present circumstances, does not fall under bilateral
investment treaty protection.**

286. Respondent further argues that there is a real risk of double compensation should Claimant be
allowed to institute a claim under the Treaty noting that Ashdod can pursue a claim before an
international arbitral tribunal and ongoing civil proceedings before Polish courts.***

Claimant’s Position

287. Claimant does not dispute that an investment procured in serious violation of Polish law is not
entitled to the protections of the Treaty8° However, Claimant states that prior tribunals,
including Hamester (which is cited by Respondent) have confirmed that the alleged illegality
must relate to the acquisition of the investment,**’ and that the jurisdictional significance of the
‘legality requirement’ is exhausted once the investment has been made.***

288. In this regard, Claimant argues that Respondent has not met its burden of proof,*” in that it has
failed to proffer any evidence that Claimant acquired its investments in BH Travel for the purpose
of initiating and benefitting from this dispute, in violation of its duty of good faith or any other
requirements of Polish law.*”? Claimant also points out that the actions of Claimant that
Respondent complains of “are irrelevant” to jurisdiction in this case “as none of these actions

relate to the acquisition of the Claimant’s investment in BH Travel”?!

289. Claimant disputes Respondents assertion that Claimant was seeking to incite and escalate a
dispute with PPL, calling it a “far-fetched conspiracy theory” and a “smokescreen to distract from
the unlawful expropriation of Claimant’s investment at Chopin Airport” noting that Respondent
repeatedly rebuffed BH Travel’s calls for amicable settlement.’ Claimant stresses that it viewed
its investment in the Polish duty-free market as a “doorway to the European market” and that “a
long-term presence at Chopin Airport in Warsaw was and remains far more valuable to the
Flemingo Group than any immediate monetary compensation”.*? Claimant submits further that
it did not learn about the timing, scope and impact of the planned modernisation until the meeting
with PPL on 8 December 2011 — “long after it had acquired an indirect controlling shareholding
in BH Travel”, and further that “it had no interest in opposing any planned modernization until
after PPL sought to compel the termination of BH Travel’s Lease Agreements on the basis of the
forthcoming modernization”

290. Claimant submits that the cases relied upon by Respondent “are plainly distinguishable from the
present case”.**° In Phoenix Action, the claimant had acquired two companies that were already
embroiled in a dispute with the host State (whereas, Claimant asserts, it acquired its indirect
shareholding in Baltona in March 2011, before any dispute had arisen concerning the planned
modernisation).*°° The issue in Inceyasa related to a claimant making fraudulent
misrepresentations to obtain a contract (Claimant states, there are no such circumstances in the
present case).*”” In addition, Claimant observes that the tribunal in Hamester upheld jurisdiction,
illustrating the high standard of proof required to establish a successful illegality defence.

291. Claimant submits that Respondent’s concerns about double compensation are unavailing, citing
Professor Schreuer’s assertion that this cannot be construed in a manner that denies the investor
standing.*” Claimant asserts that it is undisputed that Ashdod never pursued arbitration
proceedings against Respondent, and therefore Ashdod’s notice of dispute is irrelevant to the
present arbitration.4”°

5) Tribunal’s Analysis
The Tribunal has considered the positions of both Parties with regard to its jurisdiction.

It will first examine whether the dispute concerns an ‘investment’ as required by Article 1(1) of
the Treaty. It will then discuss whether Claimant is an ‘investor’ as required by Article 1(2) of
the Treaty. Furthermore, it will consider whether Claimant was engaged in forum shopping, and
thus could not benefit from the protection under the Treaty. Finally, it will consider whether the
activities of the Flemingo Group were conducted in bad faith, so that Claimant would not deserve
Treaty protection.

Whether the Dispute concerns an ‘Investment’

The Tribunal will first examine whether the dispute — ratione materiae — concerns an
‘investment’ within the scope of the Treaty. Claimant submits that its indirect shareholding in
BH Travel and all rights associated therewith constitute its protected investment.“”'

In order to address this issue, the Tribunal begins its analysis from the definition of ‘investment’
within the Treaty. Indeed, as also was decided in Saluka: “the Tribunal must always bear in mind
the terms of the Treaty under which it operates”.“

Article 1(1) of the Treaty contains a very broad definition of the term ‘investment’, namely: “the
term investment means every kind of asset established or acquired, in accordance with the
national laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made [...]”.

Article 9 of the Treaty, on “Settlement of Disputes between the Investor and the Contracting
Party”, which forms the basis of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, allows the Parties to submit to
arbitration “any dispute between the investor of one Contracting party and the other Contracting
Party in relation to an investment of the former under this Agreement”.

Article 9 of the Treaty, and not Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, is the jurisdictional basis of
the present arbitration. Consequently, jurisdictional restrictions deriving from the notion of
‘investment’ in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, as emphasised by various ICSID tribunals
such as the Sa/ini panel, do not apply to the present arbitration. Moreover, the present Tribunal
is convened under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which merely refer to any “dispute”,
without any further qualification.

a. The Lease Agreements and Permits as an ‘Investment’

The Tribunal finds — contrary to Respondent’s submissions — that the Lease Agreements and the
related permits for conducting business in the DFZ of Chopin Airport have to be considered
‘investments’ under the Treaty.

Article 1(1) of the Treaty provides that “in particular, though not exclusively”, investments
include: “c) rights to any performance under contract having a financial value”. Consequently,
the Lease Agreements obtained by BH Travel, and the expenses to install and promote the shops,
are investments made in Poland falling within the scope of the Treaty.

“2 Saluka v. The Czech Republic Partial Award, para. 241, Exhibit CL-19.

302.

303.

304.

305.

306.

In addition, the Tribunal notes that, although this ground of jurisdiction was not pursued by
Claimant,*® Article 1(1) of the Treaty provides that, investments include: “(e) business
concessions conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for and extract
oil and other minerals”.

In this regard the Tribunal is of the view that a business concession does not necessarily need to
be a concession for public works or for activities in areas that are key to the State’s security, nor
does it need to be granted by the State itself — as Respondent incorrectly alleges. The fact that the
Lease Agreements must be obtained through a tender to be considered to be a ‘concession’ under
Polish law does not exclude them from being considered ‘investments’ falling within the scope
of the Treaty. The Lease Agreements and permits may therefore also fall within the scope of the
Treaty as ‘business concessions’, as understood in Article 1(1)(e) of the Treaty.“

b. The Baltona Shares as an ‘Investment’

BH Travel is a Polish company and therefore its investments in Poland are not protected under
the Treaty. However, BH Travel is 100% owned by Baltona, another Polish company. Since June
2011, 80.68% of Baltona’s shares are owned by Ashdod, which in turn is 100% owned by
Flemingo International. On 31 March 2011, Flemingo DutyFree (Claimant) became the sole
owner of Flemingo International.“®* At the time of Claimant’s filing of its Statement of Claim,
Flemingo DutyFree held 84.8% percent of the shares in Flemingo International because of a
further restructuring within the Flemingo Group on 29 October 2012.4% The Parties have
different views on whether such acquisition of shares falls within the scope of the term
‘investment’ under the Treaty.

The Tribunal notes that Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty provides that ‘investment’ also means:
“(b) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other similar forms of participation
in a company”.

Article 1(1) of the Treaty has a very broad definition of ‘investment’. As other investment
arbitration tribunals have decided with regard to similarly broad definitions of the term
‘investment’,“” such definitions do not exclude indirect investments through controlling
shareholding via intermediate companies. Consequently, the indirect shareholding in BH Travel,
the holder of the Lease Agreements and concessions for the duty-free shops, equally qualifies as
a protected investment under the Treaty.

The Tribunal observes that Article 1(1) of the Treaty not only covers investments that were

“°3 Claimant’s Reply, para. 211.

4 The Tribunal notes that the examples given in Article 1(1) are mere illustrations of different types of
investments covered by the Treaty (*...though not exclusively, includes...”). Therefore, even if the Lease
Agreements were mere civil law agreements of a purely contractual nature, they could be considered to be
‘investments’.

“established” but also investments that were “acquired”. This is markedly different, for instance,
from the investment treaty between Canada and Venezuela, as applied in Gold Reserve Inc. and
frequently referred to in this case.*°* As such, the definition of ‘investment’ under the Treaty
encompasses the acquisition of shares.

307. Claimant argues that, while it had held no direct or indirect shareholding in Baltona or BH Travel
before March 2011, since its acquisition of Flemingo International (for a total consideration of
USD 26,505,000) on 31 March 2011 it has consistently been an indirect controlling shareholder
of BH Travel and Baltona.‘”

308. Respondent has challenged the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis that Claimant’s acquisition of
Flemingo International did not directly concern any Polish entity. Respondent argues that, at
most, this acquisition is a transaction within the Flemingo Group and not an investment in Poland.
Accordingly, Respondent asserts that Claimant “has never conducted and does not conduct any
business in Poland”.“"° Thus, Respondent has argued that the acquisition is not an ‘investment’
under the Treaty since it was not made in Poland as allegedly required by the Treaty. The majority
of the Tribunal disagrees. The Tribunal notes that an investment, as defined in Articles 1(1) and

 

9 of the Treaty, need not be made in the territory of the host State. In this regard, the Tribunal
notes that many other tribunals have held that investments, acquired by a third party outside the
territory of the host State may also constitute investments.*!! Consequently, the indirect
acquisition of Baltona’s shares by Claimant, an Indian company established outside of Poland, is
an ‘investment’ under the Treaty.

309. Respondent has also argued that the actual ‘investment’ was the acquisition of the Lease
Agreements and concessions as well as the installation of the airport shops by BH Travel, and
not the acquisition of shares of Baltona, the holding company of BH Travel. In addition,

Respondent has disputed that the acquisition of Baltona shares can be considered as Claimant’s
412

 

investment as it did not participate financially in the process of the acquisition.

310. In fact under investment treaties, investments can just as well consist of a shareholding in a local
company, as of the investments made by a local company, controlled by successive intermediate
companies. The investor “steps into the shoes” of the local company and claims for damages
suffered by the local company as if it had been inflicted, on a pro rata basis, on itself. Those two
different aspects of “upstream protection” of investors have clearly been identified by the
International Court of Justice.“'? Each type of investment gives rise to specific legal questions:
in the case of shares, whether the value of the shareholding is affected; in case of indirect
investments, whether the rights of the local company have been violated. Of course both
approaches may be combined. The actual investment may be made by a local company, but may

Whether Claimant is an ‘Investor’

The Tribunal next addresses the issue of whether Claimant is an ‘investor’ that is protected by
the Treaty.

Both Parties agree that Claimant is a company established under the laws of India. Consequently,
since Claimant is “incorporated or established under the laws of a Contracting Party”, it fulfils
the requirement under Article 1(2) of the Treaty:

The term ‘Investors’ refers with regard to either Contracting Party to:

@) Lb
(b) legal entities, including companies, corporations, firms and business associations
incorporated or constituted or established under the law of a Contracting Party.

The Tribunal has already established that an indirect investment through shareholdings in
BH Travel, the company that obtained the Lease Agreements and the duty-free concessions,
constitutes an investment under Article 1(1) of the Treaty, and that the shares need not be
purchased by a company from within the host state.

As the tribunal in Gold Reserve pointed out:

[T]he Parties have debated at length whether the process leading to the indirect share
ownership by Claimant of a local subsidiary and, through the latter, to the holding of title to
mining rights and concessions satisfies the condition of “making” an investment in the
territory of Venezuela. The dispute is whether the Canadian company can be said to have
“made” the investment, given that the mining rights had already been granted to the
Venezuelan subsidiary before the restructure through which Gold Reserve Inc., the Canadian
company, acquired Gold Reserve Corp., the US company. Venezuela argued that, as the
investment already existed before the Canadian company was even incorporated, the
Canadian company cannot be said to have made that investment.

According to the ordinary meaning of the words, “making an investment in the territory of
Venezuela” does not require that there must be a movement of capital or other values across
Venezuelan borders.” *!

316. Likewise, the acquisition of the Baltona shares by Flemingo International after Baltona’s 100%

subsidiary, BH Travel, had obtained the Lease Agreements and the concessions, is an
‘investment’ under Article 1(1) of the Treaty. Flemingo International has to be considered as the
(indirect) investor in Baltona and, through Baltona, in BH Travel, as Respondent has admitted.4!°

317. Respondent, however, has argued that Claimant’s compliance with the condition of ‘nationality’

414 See e.g., H. Wehland, The Coordination of Multiple Proceedings in Investment Treaty Arbitration, Oxford

University Press (2013) (“Wheland”), paras. 2.33- 2.53.

318.

320.

322.

323.

must be concurrent with its compliance with the condition of making an investment in Poland.""”
In Respondent’s view, Claimant cannot be considered an ‘investor’ because it has not made an
‘investment’ within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the Treaty. In making this argument,
Respondent has assumed that such investment had to be made in Poland, whereas Claimant
acquired the investment indirectly through its acquisition of all the shares of Flemingo
International, which, as noted at paragraph 303 above, holds 100% of the shares in Ashdod, which
in turn holds 80.68% of Baltona’s shares.

The Tribunal will now determine whether Claimant became an ‘investor’ when it became the
sole owner of Flemingo International in March 2011.

In line with the decisions of other tribunals, the Tribunal interprets the Treaty according to the
rules set forth in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna Convention”).
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention provides that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in
accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and
in light of its object and purpose”.

According to the ordinary meaning of the definition in Article 1(2) of the Treaty, Claimant is an
investor if it is “incorporated or constituted or established under the law of” India, which is the
case. The definition contains no additional requirements for an entity to qualify as an ‘investor’.
The acquisition by Claimant of the shares of Flemingo International, therefore, made Claimant
an ‘investor’ entitled to the protection of the Treaty.

The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that the Treaty only protects entities that actually
have invested in Poland. Respondent unsuccessfully relies upon the Treaty Preamble, which
states that the Treaty is aimed at “fostering investments by investors of one State in the territory
of another State”, and argues that this statement implies that only entities which actually invest
in Poland should be considered ‘investors’ under the Treaty. However, the Preamble cannot
contradict the provisions of the Treaty itself. In fact, in Tokios Tokelés and Société Générale v.
Philippines, the tribunals interpreted virtually identical language in treaty preambles to provide
broad protection to investors and their investments.*!*

Article 1(1) of the Treaty does not only cover investors that “established” investments in the
territory of the other Contracting State, but also those who “acquired” such an investment.

In Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania, a United Kingdom entity brought a claim based on the
equity ownership of its Hong Kong subsidiary, to which a loan, initially granted by a Malaysian
joint venture, had been assigned. In that case the United Kingdom bank was denied protection
under the bilateral investment treaty signed by the United Kingdom and Tanzania (“United
Kingdom-Tanzania BIT”) because it had not been “doing something as part of the investing
process, either directly or through an agent or entity under the investor’s direction”.*!° In that
case, the dispute settlement clause in Article 8(1) of the United Kingdom-Tanzania BIT expressly
referred to “investment of a national or company of the other Contracting Party in the territory of
the former [Contracting Party]” and ‘investment’ was defined in Article 1 of that BIT as “every

kind of asset admitted in accordance with the legislation and regulations in force [in the host
State]”. For that tribunal, this meant that the investor had not merely to “hold” the investment,
but had to “make” it. Both provisions indicate that the investor was indeed supposed to be directly
involved in the host State.

In the India-Poland Treaty, however, Article 9 merely refers to disputes with the investor (as
defined in Article 1(2)) “in relation to an Investment of the former under this Agreement”.
Article 9 does not restrict the dispute resolution clause to disputes about investments “in the
territory”. While it is true that Article 2 delimits the scope of the Treaty as applying to “all
investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting

 

Party, accepted as such in accordance with its laws and regulations [...]”,° Article 1(1) of the
Treaty includes as ‘investments’ assets that are “acquired” (as well as “established”) in
accordance with the laws of the host state. For the majority of this Tribunal, the definition of
‘investment’ is definitive, as on the plain meaning of these provisions read together, the inclusion
of “acquired” assets within the definition allows for investments that have already been made in
Poland to fall within the scope of the Treaty as soon as they are acquired by an Indian investor.
Consequently, although Standard Chartered Bank may be relevant for bilateral investment
treaties which require investments to be made within the territory of the host State, it can be
distinguished from cases in which the bilateral investment treaties, such as the India-Poland
Treaty, not only concern investments “established” but also those later “acquired”.

 

 

The Tribunal moreover finds itself unable to agree with Respondent that Claimant cannot be
considered as an ‘investor’ for the purposes of the Treaty on the basis that it allegedly only
occupies an intermediate position in the structure of the Flemingo Group, and is neither the direct
owner of the Baltona shares, nor the ultimate beneficiary of the investment.

Respondent’s reliance on NAFTA, which requires that the investor take part in “substantial
business activities”, and thus, according to Respondent, does not cover intermediary shareholders
such as Claimant, is not convincing. The NAFTA definition and jurisprudential interpretation of
the notion ‘investor’ within the NAFTA system has no bearing upon the interpretation of
‘investor’ as applicable in the India-Poland Treaty.

By virtue of corporate restructuring, Claimant became the indirect owner of the share capital of
BH Travel, which held the Lease Agreements and the concessions to the duty-free shops at
Chopin Airport in Poland. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Article 1(2) does not require
that the investor be the “first foreign entity in the hierarchy” or “the ultimate beneficiary of the
investment”.

The Tribunal first addresses the argument that the investor needs to be the “first foreign entity in
the hierarchy”. In support of its issi Respondent refers to p that are irrelevant
for the point it intends to make. SOABI v. Senegal, one of the first ICSID awards, does not concern
the scope of bilateral investment treaty protection. Instead it is concerned with the issue of
whether an ICSID tribunal should exercise jurisdiction under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention when a local investor and the host State had chosen ICSID arbitration in their
investment contract, and the shares of the local investor were held by a foreign company. The
tribunal in that case held that the local company could only be brought under bilateral investment

“29 India-Poland Treaty, Article 2, Exhibit CL-1 (emphasis added).

treaty protection of the State to which its controlling shareholder belonged."”! In Amco v.
Indonesia, the tribunal similarly required, again for the jurisdictional purposes of Article 25(2)(b)
of the ICSID Ci ion, that the nati ity of the i holder be one that could
bring an entity, established within the host State, within the ambit of ICSID jurisdiction.”

 

 

329. In Sedelmayer the tribunal held that the controlling shareholder of a company that actually made
the investment is entitled to bilateral investment treaty protection. The Tribunal here notes that,
in the bilateral investment treaty signed by Germany and Russia (“Germany-Russia BIT”)
applicable in that case, the definition of ‘investments’ was restricted to “every kind of asset
invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Party”. Because the
India-Poland Treaty has a provision similar to the Germany-Russia BIT, the decision in
Sedelmayer confirms that the direct shareholder of Baltona’s shares can, in all events, be
considered an ‘investor’ under the Treaty. However, as the Germany-Russia BIT does not extend
investments to shares “acquired”, Sedelmayer excluded from the scope of the Germany-Russia
BIT companies which, at a later stage, acquired the investments that were made.

330. The award in Tokios Tokelés, to which Respondent refers, is equally irrelevant in sustaining
Respondents point. Tokios Tokelés states only that some bilateral investment treaties require the
activity within the country of incorporation in order to be
protected under the bilateral investment treaty. However, the tribunal in Tokios Tokelés decided
that such requirements only apply when the investment treaty expressly provided as such, stating:
“[i]n our view, it is not for tribunals to impose limits on the scope of [bilateral investment treaties]
not found in the text [...]’. The Tokios Tokelés tribunal therefore decided that such a
q if it were not i in the bilateral i treaty, cannot be subsequently
added to restrict the notion of ‘investors’ in that case. This award thus confirms this Tribunal’s
reasoning that, because the India-Poland Treaty does not impose restrictions other than a
nationality requirement, it does not exclude investors that are not the first shareholding company
in line.”

  

investor to have some busine:

 

331. With regard to Respondent’s alternative submission that only “the ultimate beneficiary of the
investment” would be entitled to the Treaty’s protection, the Tribunal observes that, as between
Claimant and the ultimate beneficiary of the investment, there are indeed three layers of
companies (see para. 106 above). However, the Tribunal notes again that the Treaty did not
expressly provide for the limitation of treaty protection to the ultimate beneficiary of the
investment and, therefore, such a restriction cannot be read into it. The decisions of Sedelmayer
and Société Générale v. The Dominic Republic,’* on which Respondent relies extensively to
prove this general principle, in fact do not support Respondent’s view. Those tribunals limited
their analyses to the issue of whether the claimants had the proper nationality to be granted treaty

85 The facts in Société Générale v. The Dominican Republic, to which Respondent refers, are interesting. Société
Générale only had a 25% interest in the investment. Nevertheless, it was considered an investor under the BIT.
Paragraphs 44-45 of the award in that case confirm also that ‘complex corporate structures are a normal feature
of international business and if lawful and legitimate, do not exclude treaty protection’. Société Générale v.

protection in those cases.

In fact, in the present case, there is no obstacle to applying the Treaty provisions as they are and,
to the extent that the issue relates to Treaty protection of Claimant as an Indian company that
acquired an ‘investment’ within the scope of the Treaty through its shareholding in Flemingo
International, various tribunals have already accepted that intermediate entities in a holding

structure can qualify as ‘investors’?

 

Respondent has that, for ies in a string of i harehold the
possibility of being considered to be an ‘investor’ should be subject to a “cut-off” for indirect
shareholders that are too remote, and argues that Claimant is beyond that cut-off point. However,
for this Tribunal, the Enron v. Argentina and Standard Chartered Bank awards, to which
Respondent refers as precedents in support of its contention, do not prove this point.

In Enron, the claimant was a minority shareholder holding only 35% of the initial investor’s
shares. Argentina suggested a cut-off in order to avoid “an endless chain of claims” in which
several minority shareholders would simultaneously present their individual claims. In the
present case, however, Claimant has, by a large percentage, majority control over Baltona, so
that the risk of simultaneous actions from different shareholders would be minimal.

In Standard Chartered Bank, the tribunal had held that the United Kingdom-Tanzania BIT
required that the investor would have funded the initial investment, or would control or manage
such investment once made. This requirement did not concern the cut-off within a chain of
intermediate shareholders, but instead, turned on the notions of ‘investment’ and ‘investor’ itself.
The tribunal in Standard Chartered Bank only decided whether the claimant in that case actually
made and/or managed the initial investment. In the present case, however, the India-Poland
Treaty has a broader scope and also includes as an ‘investment’ mere shareholding and the
acquisition of investments already made.

In fact, to the Tribunal’s knowledge, a cut-off because of remoteness has not yet led any tribunal
to deny bilateral investment treaty protection to an indirect controlling shareholder. Moreover, a
ible cut-off has only been envisaged for entities that were so remote from the original
investment that they could not have been foreseen by the host State. In the present case, Poland
could have been aware that Claimant would be affected.’””

 

Whether Claimant is denied protection because of “forum shopping”

The Tribunal does not consider that Claimant has engaged in forum shopping by instigating the
present claim.

Claimant, a controlling indirect shareholder of Baltona, whose subsidiary, BH Travel, operated
the duty-free shops, is in its own right an investor, entitled to protection under the Treaty.

The circumstance that Ashdod, the wholly-owned subsidiary of Claimant’s subsidiary, Flemingo
International, also submitted a notice of arbitration, this time under the bilateral investment treaty

e.g. ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela, Decision on Jurisdiction and the Merits, Ex. CL-75, pp. 3-4, para. 7,

signed by Cyprus and Poland (“Cyprus-Poland BIT”), does not exclude Claimant from its own
protection. International investment law does not exclude several entities, situated at different
levels of an investment structure, from claiming investment protection.*?* Besides, Ashdod has
not pursued the arbitration proceedings it initially commenced, so that, in the present
circumstances, no parallel investment treaty awards will be rendered.

340. In Saluka, to which Respondent refers to exclude Claimant from Treaty protection, the tribunal

341.

in fact confirmed that it is not necessary for the claimant to actively operate the investment and
that a subsequent acquisition of shares does not preclude the claimant from having recourse to
arbitration under the applicable treaty — as long as the acquisition was not made after the breach
of the investment treaty has occurred.’ In this case, Claimant’s acquisition of its indirect
shareholding in Baltona took place on 31 March 2011 (when Claimant became the sole owner of
Flemingo International), which is well before the dispute between BH Travel and PPL arose.

Likewise, the fact that the termination of the Lease Agreements was — and is — the subject-matter
of many proceedings before the Polish domestic courts is also not an obstacle for the Tribunal to
exercise its jurisdiction, as defined by the India-Poland Treaty, which does not restrict tribunals’
jurisdiction in cases where proceedings are underway before domestic courts. Besides, it appears
from the record of evidence in this case that much of the litigation before Polish courts has been
initiated by PPL.

342. It is also not an impediment for the Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction if Claimant, an Indian

company, allegedly does not deploy commercial activities in India and is not involved in the
Polish operations of the Flemingo Group. The Treaty does not impose any of these
requirements upon Claimant and it is not for the Tribunal to add such restrictions to the definition
and scope of the Treaty.

Whether there is any basis to deny Claimant Treaty Protection

 

343. The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent that the Flemingo Group conducted its activities

in bad faith and in breach of the fundamental principles of law. As will be explained hereafter
(see paras.545-548 below), in the Tribunal’s opinion, termination of the Lease Agreements
without compensation because of BH Travel’s non-compliance with their contract terms was not
imminent. The respective entities of the Flemingo Group did not initiate proceedings to avoid a
termination without compensation and to get an advantageous settlement.

344. The Tribunal similarly does not follow Respondent where it suggests that protection of indirect

#8 See e.g. Antoine Goetz et consort

investments would constitute an abuse of the protection that the India-Poland Treaty grants. As
has been demonstrated above, indirect investors are protected by the Treaty and no bad faith from
Claimant’s side has been proven. No irregularities or violations of Polish law in the acquisition
of the investment, which would take away Treaty protection, have been shown.

VI.

A.

349,

Claimant has submitted that BH Travel had invested in the Lease Agreements, and the shares of
Baltona had been acquired by Flemingo International in good faith to grant the Flemingo Group
entry into the Polish duty-free market “as a doorway to the European market”,"*! well before the
termination of the Lease Agreements was ‘in the air’. Respondent has not, in the Tribunal’s view,
been able to prove otherwise. Similarly, the restructuring of Flemingo Group, pursuant to which
Flemingo International became a subsidiary of Claimant, equally appears to have been conceived
for business purposes and in good faith — well before the termination of the Lease Agreements
became a matter of concern.

The Tribunal thus concludes that the present proceedings do not constitute an abuse of Claimant’s
right to treaty protection.

As stated above, the possibility of parallel claims, emanating from two different indirect investors
at different levels of the investment structure, follows from the investment law itself and has been
confirmed by several awards. International investment law contains several mechanisms to avoid
parallel proceedings. One of them could be a taking away of treaty protection because of abuse
of process — although not yet applied by tribunals.*”? However, it cannot by itself constitute an
abuse of p ings when both a shareholder and a i of the
former give notice of separate claims under respective bilateral investment treaties against the
same host State for the same subject-matter, when one of them does not pursue its claim — as has
occurred in this case. Indeed, at present no two awards are being rendered on the same
subject-matter and there is no risk of conflicting or overlapping awards. Besides, even if in the
given scenario an abuse of procedure were possible, it could only be committed by Ashdod if it
resumed its proceedings — which is not presently the case.

For the reasons set out above, the majority of the Tribunal has determined that it has jurisdiction
over this dispute pursuant to Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty.

MERITS
Attribution

Claimant submits that the measures complained of in these proceedings implicate several Polish
State authorities, including: (i) PPL; (ii) the Customs Chamber in Warsaw; and (iii) the Governor
of Mazovia, as well as several Ministries, including the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry
of Treasury. Claimant contends that the conduct of these entities is attributable to Respondent
83 pursuant to Article 4 and Article 5 of the International Law
Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC
Articles”).4** The ILC Articles, Claimant argues, are widely accepted and applied by investment
treaty tribunals as “a codification of customary international law with regard to the issue of
attribution of conduct” of a State.***

350. Respondent disputes that the ILC Articles are relevant to this case, although it acknowledges that
they are guidelines used by the international community. Respondent also denies that PPL’s
activities are attributable to Respondent pursuant to the ILC Articles.**°

1) Whether PPL is a State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles
Claimant’s Position

351. Claimant submits that PPL is an organ of the Polish State and thus its conduct is attributable to
Respondent under Article 4(1) of the ILC Articles — which provides that “[t]he conduct of any
State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ
exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other function, whatever position it holds in the
organization of the State”.*”

352. Specifically, Claimant submits that the acts of PPL are attributable to Respondent because:
(i) PPL is a de facto State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles; and (ii) PPL
has been operating under the control and supervision of the Ministry of Transport, including
during the implementation of the modernisation of Chopin Airport.

353. Claimant argues that the term “State organ” contained in Article 4(1) has a “very broad

meaning”.*** Claimant submits that other investment treaty tribunals have adopted a very broad

interpretation of this term and have understood that the term “State organ” in Article 4 of the ILC

Articles “can be any ‘part of the centralized or decentralized structure of the State’”.”

354. Moreover, Claimant submits that an entity’s status as a “State organ” under Article 4 of the ILC
Articles is not determined by its status under national law.” Claimant cites the Commentary to
Article 4, which provides that “a State cannot avoid responsibility for the conduct of a body
which does in truth act as one of its organs merely by denying it that status under its own law”.“!
In Claimant’s view, this means that the legal status of PPL under domestic Polish law is not
determinative.

355. Claimant notes that PPL is the legal successor of a government agency — Poland’s Air Traffic
and Airport Management Board (“ATAMB”). Pursuant to the PPL Act, which established PPL
as a State-owned company, PPL took over all ATAMB’s property, rights, and liabilities.“

Claimant submits that the PPL Act provides the regulatory framework through which the
Ministry of Transport exercises supervision and control of PPL, together with the detailed
supervision method note issued in August 2008 (“Supervision Note”).

356. According to Claimant, this regulatory framework “places PPL within the structure of the
Ministry of Transport as required to qualify as a de facto State organ under ILC Article 4 on the
following bases”: (i) the PPL Act grants the Ministry of Transport the power to appoint, suspend,
and dismiss the management of PPL, and to audit and assess the General Director’s performance;
(ii) the PPL Act grants the Ministry of Transport the power to direct PPL to perform certain tasks,
such as the ones necessary to comply with international obligations, and to limit its performance;
(iii) the regulatory framework delegates to the Ministry of Transport the duty to audit and assess
PPL’s operations and establish a structure to exercise control over PPL’s activities, including
over PPL’s finances and staff salaries; (iv) pursuant to the PPL Act, PPL’s General Director has
to provide a regular report to the Minister of Transport concerning its activities; and (v) both the
PPL Act and the Supervision Note confirm PPL’s role in effecting various Polish State policies
and conducting State policies in the Polish interest, particularly in civil aviation and defence.“
Claimant concludes that the PPL Act thus “placed [PPL] firmly within the structure of the
Ministry of Transport” and under its supervision.“

357. As support for its conclusion, Claimant points out that the tribunal in Kardassopoulos v. Georgia
considered two State-owned oil companies to be State organs within the meaning of Article 4 of
the ILC Articles, since they were operating “under the auspices” of a ministry and “within the
structure” of the State.“° Similarly, in Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka, the tribunal found that a
State-owned petroleum company was a de facto State organ,’ having noted in particular that the
relevant minister exercised significant control over the company’s personnel, finances and
decision making. Claimant submits that PPL also operates under the auspices of a State ministry
and thus qualifies as a de facto State organ.“*

358. Claimant disputes Respondent’s assertion that PPL had independent operations and liabilities.“”
Claimant also disputes Respondent’s claims that the powers granted to the Ministry of Transport
are only “theoretical™*° and that PPL’s actions do not depend on the approval of Polish
authorities.**' Claimant states that although PPL may have “some limited day-to-day operational

independence” it remains subject to a “comprehensive State control structure” which is sufficient
for it to be deemed an organ of the State under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.” Furthermore,

Claimant argues that the Minister continues to exercise his or her powers under the PPL Act.**

359. Claimant submits that the project for the modernisation of Chopin Airport was also under the
close control and supervision of the Ministry of Transport.‘ In this regard, Claimant points to
the Performance Agreement concluded between PPL and the Minister of Transport in 2010 to
modernise the Chopin Airport (“Performance Agreement”), which, in Claimant’s view,
subjected the modernisation to “close control” by the Ministry of Transport. One of the examples
of this “control” cited by Claimant was the requirement that PPL keep the Ministry informed
about the modernisation. Claimant notes that PPL did report to the Ministry about the dispute
with BH Travel, providing the Ministry with an “urgent presentation on PPL’s position regarding
the dispute” and exchanged further communications about the matter.**°

360. Claimant adds that Mr. Zbigniew Rynasiewicz, the Ministry’s Secretary of State specifically
charged with the supervision of PPL, made contemporaneous statements that confirmed that the
Ministry of Transport exercised close supervision over PPL. In a first speech to the Polish
Parliament on 18 November 2011, he stated that “[PPL] is an enterprise which is functioning
within the structure of the Ministry of Infrastructure”. In a second speech, in 2013, Mr. Zbigniew
Rynasiewicz stated “we are also responsible for all issues connected with the functioning of
[PPL] — at the Chopin Airport in Warsaw”.**°

361. Finally, Claimant notes that Respondent does not dispute that the actions of the Warsaw Chamber
of Commerce and the Governor of Mazovia can be considered acts of Poland.**’

Respondent's Position

362. Respondent disputes Claimant’s arguments that PPL is an “emanation of Poland” and that PPL’s
activities are attributable to Respondent pursuant to the ILC Articles.

363. Respondent explains that the relationship between PPL and the Polish State Treasury is
determined by the PPL Act, according to which PPL is a legal entity. The shares of PPL wholly
belong to the State Treasury.*** Respondent points out that, pursuant to the PPL Act, the State
Treasury only exercises ownership control over PPL and its supervision of PPL only applies to

outsourced tasks.“ Respondent states that PPL is not privately owned because it “performs
strategic functions for the existence of the State”.

364. Respondent emphasises that under the PPL Act, PPL is a State enterprise, and not a State organ.**!

Respondent further explains that the formation of PPL as a State-owned enterprise, a relic of the
centrally planned economy, does not mean that it is an emanation of the State. In this regard,
Respondent notes that the Act on State-Owned Enterprises provides that “[a] State-owned
self-governing and _ self- i with legal

 

enterprise is an i
personality”.“?

365. In any event, Respondent contends that PPL’s status as an independent company follows from
the PPL Act (specifically Articles 6 and 9). Pursuant to those provisions, Respondent submits,
PPL’s decisions are not subject to control by Poland.* Respondent submits that PPL handles its
own business and Poland does not interfere in these matters — the competent minister only
supervises PPL and does not influence its commercial policies or relationship with its business

partners.“

366. Respondent further states that “PPL’s actions do not depend on the approval of the Polish
authorities”.“° Respondent notes that State Treasury’s approval may sometimes be needed, but

367. Respondent argues that Claimant is aware of the separation between PPL and Respondent
because when Claimant applied to Polish courts with regard to the termination of the Lease
Agreements," it filed proceedings against PPL only and not against Poland.*”

368. Respondent disagrees with Claimant’s interpretation of the ILC Articles and its reliance on the
decision in Kardassopoulos. According to Respondent, “the arguments [...] cited [by Claimant]
do not justify and do not prejudge the fact that PPL should be treated as an authority (emanation)
of the State”.47"

determined by the entity’s status under national law. Respondent argues that this interpretation is
“completely contrary to the letter of the second paragraph of Article 4 of the ILC [Draft] Articles
which “clearly provides” that, in order to assess whether or not an entity is a State organ, account
must be taken of its national rights. In this regard, Respondent reiterates that PPL is an
independent entity under national laws and that it makes independent decisions. Therefore,
Respondent concludes that PPL is not a State organ within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC
Articles.”

370. Second, Respondent does not agree with Claimant’s assumption that an entity may be deemed to
be a State organ just because it belongs to the State structure. For Respondent, the awards cited
by Claimant concern “other facts and entities, the functioning of which has been governed
differently to that of PPL”.4”

371. Respondent concedes that an analysis of PPL’s ownership structure may lead to the conclusion
that PPL is a State body. However, Respondent submits that the “analysis of the PPL Act proves
that this is not actually the case”."" The PPL Act, Respondent reiterates, “clearly and without
any further space for interpretation” provides that PPL is a State enterprise, and not a State
organ."

372. Respondent submits that if the Tribunal wishes to determine whether PPL is a State organ, it
should conduct “a very diligent and broad test proving that in fact PPL is a State organ”. As
support for this contention, Respondent refers to La Générale des Carriéres et des Mines v. F.G.
Hemisphere Associates LLC (Jersey) in which the Privy Council stated that it would take “quite
extreme circumstances” to displace the presumption that separate corporate status should be
respected when an entity has been set up by a State for commercial or industrial purposes.‘”°

373. Respondent also refers to the tribunal’s ruling in Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain, which, according
to Respondent, focused on the functions a private entity performs, and not on its ownership
structure, to determine whether it is an emanation of the State.4”” In Respondent’s view, this is
also determined by whether the functions delegated to the entity are reserved for the State (the
sphere of dominium).‘” Applying this analysis, Respondent submits, “leads to the conclusion
that PPL cannot be considered to be an emanation of the State” and the lease of retail space cannot
be included among the tasks charged to and performed by PPL for and on behalf of the State
Treasury.‘

374. Respondent dismisses Claimant’s suggestion that the statements from the Ministry’s Secretary
of State show that PPL might be within the structure of the Ministry of Transport, noting that

they are public statements made in a political context, and are not a source of law in Poland.“

375. Respondent thus concludes that PPL is not an emanation of Poland,**! that the termination of the
Lease Agreements by PPL cannot be attributed to Poland, and that Respondent cannot be held
liable for these actions.”

376. With regard to the acts of the Governor of Mazovia and the Customs Chamber, Respondent
concedes that they “can be considered as actions of Poland”. However, Respondent asserts that
the actions mentioned by Claimant concerning these entities do not constitute breaches of the
Treaty.**

2) Whether PPL exercised delegated governmental authority within the meaning of
Article 5 of the ILC Articles

Claimant’s Position

377. Claimant submits that, in case the Tribunal finds that Article 4 of the ILC Articles is not
applicable," the acts of PPL are attributable to Respondent because the company acted with
delegated governmental authority under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, which provides that the
conduct of an entity may be attributed to a State if that entity “is empowered by the law of that
State to exercise elements of the governmental authority [...] provided the person or entity is
acting in that capacity in the particular instance”.“** Claimant submits that Respondent does not
dispute this test.**°

378. Claimant contends that the term “entity” encompasses a “wide variety of bodies”, such as,
according to the commentary to the ILC Articles, “public corporations, semi-public entities,
public agencies or private companies”.“*’ In order to determine whether the acts of an entity are
attributable to a State under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, prior investment treaty tribunals have
applied the test set out in Article 5, by inquiring whether an entity is exercising elements of
governmental authority in performing the acts in question.**

379. Claimant considers that PPL exercised governmental authority in: (i) terminating BH Travel’s
leases over State property; (ii) terminating BH Travel’s leases to pursue the modernisation of
Chopin Airport; and (iii) procuring the imposition of customs closures on BH Travel’s stores.

380. First, Claimant contends that PPL exercised governmental authority by managing State-owned
property, i.e., the land where the Chopin Airport is located.**? According to Claimant, the
decision in Bosh v. Ukraine provides precedent that the management of State-owned property
constitutes an exercise of governmental authority.”

381. Claimant notes that under the State Treasury Act, PPL was frequently required to seek, and did
seek, the consent of the State Treasury in relation to the Lease Agreements. Claimant asserts that
PPL needed the State Treasury’s consent before entering into any lease agreements over State
land with BH Travel and “repeatedly informed Baltona of this [consent] requirement”.”’ PPL
also needed consent from the State Treasury before agreeing to any substantive change to lease
agreements over State land.” In Claimant’s view, since termination constituted a “significant
change” to the Lease Agreements, it follows that termination was an act of delegated
governmental authority.*°

382. Claimant disputes Respondent’s assertion that PPL sought approval from the State Treasury
because of Poland’s ownership interest in PPL (and not because of Polish legislation
requirements).’* In Claimant’s view, the pattern of authorisation on record indicates that “the
obligation to obtain State Treasury approvals arose because PPL acted under delegated
governmental authority in managing leases of State land”.*°°

 

383. Claimant also dismisses Respondent’s observation that PPL was under no obligation to use a
public tender process to grant the Lease Agreements, and submits that this does not affect the
nature of the delegated governmental authority which PPL was exercising.”

384. Second, Claimant contends that PPL also exercised governmental authority in connection with
the modernisation of Chopin Airport. According to Claimant, such authority was delegated to
PPL both through various agreements in 2008 and 2010, and through the enactment of the Airport
Act in 2009.”

Ministry of Transport to effect the allocation funds received from the EU) and PPL in 2008 —
granted PPL the authority to prepare the modernisation project “in full scope”. The CEUTP
Agreement also set out a framework for CEUTP to supervise the modernisation at Chopin
Airport; in addition to the institutional control and supervision from the Ministry of Transport."**
According to Claimant, the Ministry thus “indirectly delegated” authority to PPL through the
CEUTP Agreement.”

386. Similarly, Claimant submits that the Performance Agreement — signed by PPL and the Ministry
of Transport in 2010 — delegated governmental authority to PPL and granted it “broad powers to
plan the modernization of Chopin Airport and to use [the EU funds] for this purpose (under close
supervision of the Ministry of Transport)”.

387. Claimant also submits that the Airport Act delegated governmental authority to PPL since it
effectively empowered PPL to select properties to be expropriated, which is “a quintessential
government prerogative”.*""

388. According to Claimant, Respondent does not dispute any of the evidence cited by Claimant that
PPL exercised delegated governmental authority from the Ministry of Transport and argues only
that the Ministry of Transport did not interfere with PPL’s actions.* Claimant also maintains
that the exercise of delegated governmental authority in question is confirmed by the statements
made by the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Transport.

389. In view of the above, Claimant submits that: (i) PPL was exercising governmental authority in
managing State-owned leases at Chopin Airport and terminating the Lease Agreements with BH.
Travel; and (ii) the Airport Act granted PPL the power to select properties for expropriation,
which is a “quintessential government prerogative”, to bring about the modernisation.“ It was
these delegated powers that were used by PPL to terminate the Lease Agreements with BH Travel
and evict it from Chopin Airport on a pretextual basis to effect the modernisation.“ Thus,
Claimant concludes, the internationally wrongful acts related to the termination of the Lease
Agreements are attributable to Respondent pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Articles.”

390. Third, Claimant contends that PPL also exercised delegated governmental authority in procuring
customs closures on all of BH Travel’s stores in the DFZ. Claimant submits that this has been

recognised as an act of governmental authority by the Civil Division of the Regional Court.***
Claimant therefore submits that PPL’s procuring of customs closures was also attributable to
Respondent under Article 5 of the ILC Articles.*”

Respondent's Position

In addition to the arguments that PPL is not an emanation of the Polish State and that it operates
as an independent entity,*!° Respondent submits that PPL’s activities in managing the retail
premises at Chopin Airport do not raise “any question of enforcement of dominion commissioned

  

by the State Treasury”. Therefore Respondent challenges Claimant’s conclusion with regard to
the functional test provided in Article 5 of the ILC Articles.*""

Respondent challenges Claimant’s reliance on Bosh, arguing that Claimant ignores “important
elements of the facts” in the case, which “applied to the management of real property belonging
to Ukraine, through the Taras Shevchenko University”.*’? In Respondent's view, this differs
significantly from this case. In this regard, Respondent contends that by taking care of the
buildings at Chopin Airport, PPL is not managing State Treasury property but its own property.
Respondent concludes that “there cannot be any question of enforcement of dominion
commissioned by the State Treasury” and that PPL’s activities cannot be considered to be
activities of the State Treasury.°

Respondent reiterates its position that pursuant to Articles 6 and 9 of the PPL Act, PPL is a State
enterprise independently running its business. Respondent contends that Claimant “has not
presented any evidence proving that PPL’s termination of the Lease Agreements was carried out
under the direction of the Polish Government’s authority”.

Referring to the testimony of Messrs. ; | [MM], Kazimierski, and Hi [PN], Respondent
explains that the termination of the Lease Agreements was PPL’s independent decision.

Respondent also disputes that entering into or terminating commercial civil law contracts, like
the Lease Agreements, can be regarded as the execution of governmental authority.*!*
Respondent notes in this regard that PPL was not obliged to organise a public tender in order to

conclude the Lease Agreements.*!*

Respondent relies on the test used in Ceskoslovenskd Obchodni Banka, a. s. v. The Slovak
Republic, as well as in Maffezini, to establish whether acts were essentially commercial or
governmental in nature, and argues that applying that test shows that the termination of the Lease

 

Agreements “was purely a commercial act with no State imperium or sovereignty involvement

3) Whether the Tribunal should draw adverse inferences from Respondent’s failure to
produce documents

Claimant’s Position

397. With reference to the Parties’ exchanges and the relevant orders from the Tribunal related to
document production (see paras. 16-23 above),°!’ Claimant submits that Respondent has been
“obstructive at every step of the disclosure process” and points particularly to Respondent’s
refusal to produce documents responsive to Claimant’s Requests no. 1, 2,4, and 9
(“Requests”).°!* These documents, Claimant alleges, “would demonstrate the extent of the
control and supervision [Respondent] exercised over PPL”.*'?

398. To illustrate its allegation that Respondent was “obstructive” Claimant observes that Respondent
had initially refused to produce documents responsive to these Requests (and other document
production requests) on the basis that the documents were not in Respondent’s possession,
custody, and control. However, Claimant points out, Respondent was able to exhibit “over 90
documents from PPL among the 116 fact exhibits to its Statement of Defence” including a

iderable quantity of spond that had no ives of any Polish Ministry or
other State organs in copy.” Claimant concludes from these circumstances that “Respondent
[was] picking and choosing when to produce documents from PPL”*?! and that Respondent had
“misrepresented” that it did not have certain documents, which it did in fact have.

399. In any event, Claimant states, PPL is a wholly State-owned enterprise within the control of
Respondent and as such PPL’s documents would be considered to be within Respondent’s
“possession, custody and control” under the International Bar Association Rules of 29 May 2010

on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (“IBA Rules”).°”

400. Claimant also denies that Respondent met the “high burden” under Article 9(2)(e) of the IBA
Rules to resist production on the grounds that these documents contained “PPL’s trade and
company secrets”. Claimant criticises Respondent for not providing enough detail of the
alleged grounds of confidentiality, and for not explaining why the confidentiality obligations set
forth by the Tribunal would not provide sufficient protection.*”* In this regard, Claimant alleges
again that Respondent had itself exhibited a significant number of documents designated as
constituting “PPL’s enterprise confidential information” without requesting additional
confidentiality measures.*° Claimant notes that the Tribunal had dismissed Respondent’s
aforementioned objections,*”’ and made clear that the Tribunal reserved the option to draw
adverse ii from Respondent’s i ion of the p order.
Notwithstanding this warning, Respondent continued to defy the Tribunal’s order for
disclosure.°*

401. Claimant contends that the Tribunal must draw adverse inferences from Respondent’s repeated
failure to comply with the Tribunal’s orders and directions for document production.*”° The
documents requested, Claimant adds, “are [...] clearly relevant to the question [...] under ILC
Articles 4 and 5”.°°° Consequently, Claimant requests the Tribunal to draw the adverse inferences
that:

[T]he documents which the Respondent has withheld from production would prevent it from
maintaining [its defence that the actions of PPL should not be attributable to Respondent],
and demonstrate that PPL is an organ of the State within the meaning of ILC Article 4, or
that it acted with delegated governmental authority within the meaning of ILC Article 5 in
performing the internationally wrongful acts [that form the] subject of this arbitration.**!

402. Claimant submits that there is “plentiful precedent and clear guidance of eminent commentators”
in support of this position.” Article 9(5) of the IBA Rules, Claimant avers, is generally accepted
as representing common international practice, and provides that if a Party “fails to produce any
Document ordered to be produced by the Arbitral Tribunal, the Arbitral Tribunal may infer that

such document would be adverse to the interests of that Party”. Claimant refers to commentator
Gary Born, and the awards rendered in Europe Cement v. Turkey, Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan, and
INA Corporation v. Iran, in support of its contention that violation of a disclosure order without
proper reasons, which Claimant maintains has occurred in the present case, warrants the drawing

of “determinative adverse inferences”.

Claimant highlights that Respondent’s refusal to produce documents took place in spite of the
“repeated opportunities to preserve the alleged confidentiality of the documents at issue”.**
Respondent would not have defied the Tribunal’s orders, Claimant contends, “unless it had
serious and well-founded concerns that they would render entirely untenable its defence that the
actions of PPL should not be attributable to the Respondent”.**°

Claimant challenges Respondent’s argument that adverse inferences are not justified because the
documents requested were under the control of PPL.**’ According to Claimant, PPL is a 100%
State-owned entity which had been assisting and providing to Respondent two-thirds of the
exhibits submitted in this case.* In addition, Claimant states that Respondent argued that
production would affect third-party rights without providing justification for that argument.**”

Finally, Claimant notes that Respondent failed to address the issue of drawing adverse inferences
at the hearing.*”°

Respondent's Position

Respondent states that the Tribunal should not draw adverse inferences from its failure to produce
documents requested by Claimant because: (i) PPL, an independent entity and not a party to the
current proceedings, is the holder of the documents; (ii) PPL has refused to produce the evidence
requested because it affects third parties’ rights, including PPL’s business partners and
Flemingo’s competitors; (iii) under Polish law, there is no equivalent to discovery proceedings
and a party may avoid producing documents if the evidence may breach third parties’ rights; (iv)
Respondent does not have legal means to force PPL to produce and submit the evidence
requested; (v) the information contained in the evidence requested by Claimant is not relevant or
necessary to these proceedings; and (vi) legal literature does not support Claimant’s request
because Claimant cannot prove or specify any adverse consequence. These submissions are
described in turn below.

407. Respondent concedes that it has not submitted certain documents requested by Claimant,*"' but
contends that it has not produced the evidence because of the constraints described in the
preceding paragraph.”

408. Respondent argues that it was unable to produce the evidence because the holder and party to the
documents requested is PPL, and not Respondent.** As already mentioned, Respondent takes
the position that PPL is an independent business entity over which Respondent has limited
influence, and only has influence in the realm of dominium,™ but not in the realm of imperium."
According to Respondent, the Flemingo Group was informed of PPL’s commercial independence
ina letter dated 15 April 2014 from Mr. Zbigniew Rynasiewicz.*“° As such, Respondent does not
have legal means, pursuant to the pe Act, to require or to “force” the submission of any
document related to PPL’s activities.”

409. Respondent states that the PPL documents submitted with its Statement of Defence were obtained
with the company’s consent.*“* Respondent states that these documents did not provide a risk of
a breach of third parties’ rights. Respondent explains that after the Tribunal’s decision in
Procedural Order No. 2, it asked the Managing Director of PPL to provide the documents
responsive to Claimant’s Requests. However, PPL made an independent decision and refused to
submit the evidence. Respondent notes in this regard that under Polish law, a party to proceedings
may avoid the production of evidence that represents a risk of breaching third parties’ rights.>°

410. In addition, Respondent argues that attention should be paid to the nature and scope of the
documents requested and to the consequences that could arise if they were provided to the
Flemingo Group.**' According to Respondent, the d ined information

“Flemingo’s largest direct competitors on the Polish duty-free market”.**? In Respondent’s view,
the information contained in the documents requested could give Claimant “competitive
advantage” in the Polish duty-free market.**

411. Respondent also notes that the same documents were requested by Claimant in the pending
proceedings before Polish courts.*** As such, Respondent does not rule out the possibility that
Claimant’s Requests in this arbitration might be aimed at securing the documents for use in Polish
domestic proceedings.**

412. Furthermore, Respondent disputes that Claimant’s request to the Tribunal to draw adverse
inferences is justified by the legal literature and case law. Relying on legal commentary,
Respondent argues that a tribunal may only draw adverse inferences in situations where a party
“intentionally conceals evidence if, after being obligated, it refuses to produce it, but only in the
situation where it does not support its position with a reasonable justification” **°

413. Respondent cites the same commentator to claim that arbitral tribunals have refused to draw
adverse inferences unless the following premises are met:

(i) the party seeking the adverse inference must produce all available evidence
corroborating the inference sought
(ii) the requested evidence must be accessible to the inference opponent

(iii) the inference sought must be reasonable, consistent with facts in the record
and logically related to the likely nature of the evidence withheld

(iv) the party seeking the adverse inference must produce prima facie evidence
and

(v) the inference opponent must know or have reason to know, of its obligation
to produce evidence rebutting the adverse inference sought.°°7

414. Respondent asserts that its refusal to produce the evidence requested was “exhaustively
explained”*** and based on “actual and rational premises of both factual and legal nature”.*? In
addition, Respondent asserts that arbitral tribunals may refuse to draw adverse inferences in cases
where the documents are in the hands of adverse or uncooperative third parties.

415. Respondent also contends that Claimant failed to establish “a logical connection between the
likely nature of evidence withheld and the inference sought”.*' According to Respondent, the

legal literature provides that the requesting party must draw such a logical nexus and Claimant

omitted to do so. Respondent further points out that Claimant breached “significant formal

requirements set out in Procedural Order No. 2” because it refused to indicate which parts of the
requested documents it requires. **

416. Respondent also points out that Claimant failed: (i) “to specify both the specific circumstance
which it intended to demonstrate through the documents”; and (ii) “to indicate how the absence
of these documents affects its ability to prove its thesis.”*™ As a consequence, Respondent argues
that Claimant failed to respond to the Tribunal’s guidelines expressed in the e-mail on 5 March
2015.56

417. Finally, Respondent submits that Claimant cannot specify or prove any adverse consequences as
aresult of Respondent’s failure to produce the documents requested.*°

4) Tribunal’s Analysis

418. The Tribunal has to answer the question whether the acts and omissions complained of by
Claimant are imputable to Poland. This issue is important for the purpose of determining the
jurisdiction and competence of the Tribunal, because under Article 9 of the Treaty the Tribunal
only has jurisdiction to settle disputes between “an investor of one Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party”. Hence, the Tribunal has to verify whether the dispute involves Poland.
Moreover, it also bears on the merits of the dispute as Respondent may only be held responsible
for acts and omissions which are attributable to it. Both jurisdiction and merits aspects of
attribution can be analysed together.*°

 

419. In its endeavour to decide whether the acts of PPL, the Governor of Mazovia, the customs
authorities, as well as the several Ministries are attributable to Respondent, the Tribunal will be
guided by the ILC Articles.

420. Although these Articles expressly cover the obligations a responsible State may owe to another
State, to several States, or to the international community as a whole, it “is without prejudice to
any right arising from the international responsibility of a State, which may accrue directly to
any person or entity other than a State” (Article 33 of the ILC Articles). The ILC Articles have
thus been systematically applied, inter alia, to decide whether acts of corporations or entities,
committed towards a foreign investor or its investment, could be attributed to the host State and
give rise to that State’s responsibility. Investment treaty tribunals have had no difficulty in relying
on State responsibility principles to decide issues of attribution.**

421. Within the ILC Articles, Articles 4 and 5 cover the attribution of conduct of an entity to a State

for the purpose of State responsibility.
422. Article 4 provides:

Article 4
Conduct of organs of a State

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under
international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial
or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the
State, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of
a territorial unit of the State.

 

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance
with the internal law of the State.

423. Article 5 provides:

Article 5
Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under
article but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of
the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under
international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the
particular instance.

424, There cannot be any dispute that the Governor of Mazovia, the Polish courts, and the Polish
customs authorities are State organs, as Respondent also recognises. Their conduct can trigger

Poland’s international responsibility under Article 4 of the ILC Articles.

425. Whether PPL is a State organ under the principle, formulated by Article 4 of the ILC Articles,

requires a more detailed analysis of PPL’s

  

status, structure, and operations.

426. The Tribunal is guided by the decision in Maffezini, much relied upon by Respondent, where the

tribunal stated:

The fact that an entity is owned by the State gives rise to a rebuttable presumption that it is
a State entity. The same result will obtain if an entity is controlled by the State, directly or
indirectly. A similar presumption arises if an entity’s purpose or objectives is the carrying
out of functions which are governmental in nature or which are otherwise normally reserved
to the State, or which by their nature are not usually carried out by private business or

individuals.

The relevance of these standards is clearer when there is a direct State operation and control,
such as by a section or division of a Ministry, but less so when the State chooses to act
through a private sector mechanism, such as a corporation [...] or some other corporate

structure.

 

Because of the many forms that State enterprises may take and thus shape the manners of
State action, the structural test by itself may not always be a conclusive determination
whether an entity is an organ of the State or whether its acts may be attributed to the State.
‘An additional test has been developed, a functional test, which looks to the functions of or

role to be performed by the entity

Le]

It is difficult to determine, a priori, whether these various tests and standards need
necessarily be cumulative. It is likely that there are circumstances when they need not be. Of
course, when all or most of the tests result in a finding of State action, the result, while still
merely a presumption, comes closer to being conclusive.

 

The Tribunal is also of the view that a domestic determination, be it legal, judicial or
administrative, as to the juridical structure of an entity undertaking functions which may be
classified as governmental, while it is to be given considerable weight, is not necessarily
binding on an international arbitral tribunal. Whether an entity is to be regarded as an organ
of the State and whether this might ultimately engage its responsibility, is a question of fact
and law to be determined under the applicable principles of international law.5””

The Tribunal starts from the fact that PPL is owned and controlled by Poland. Indeed, as
Respondent itself admits, all shares of PPL are wholly owned by the Polish State Treasury.*”' As
outlined above, Claimant asserts that the State Treasury has actually shown a level of control in
PPL’s dealings with Baltona and BH Travel by requiring PPL to obtain: (i) approval of the Lease
Agreements; (ii) approval of certain amendments thereto; and (iii) approval of a temporary rent
reduction regarding one of the stores operated by BH Travel (see above, para. 57).°”

 

M , the ion and of an ii i airport is an activity which is not
usually carried out by private business, although a State may delegate, through well-defined
concessions, part of this management and operation to private business. In the case at hand,
however, the management and operation was not delegated to private business but to a
State-owned entity, PPL.

Furthermore, as Respondent also confirmed, PPL “performs strategic functions for the existence
of the State”.*” In explaining why Poland is the overall owner of PPL, Respondent stated that
“the transfer of such an important area of functioning of the State to private hands would be too
big a threat to internal security and the overall functioning of the State”. The PPL Act also
recognises that it carries out “tasks under the general defense obligation of the People’s Republic
of Poland” (Article 5 of the PPL Act).

Finally, PPL operates under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport (and its successor the
Ministry of and Di ) and is undoubted! by that Ministry— as
is evidenced by the PPL Act and the 2008 Supervision Note.*” Under this framework, PPL
reports intensively to the Ministry of Transport. The Minister appoints, suspends, and dismisses
the management of PPL and audits and assesses the General Director’s performance and PPL’s
operations (Articles 24 and 53 of the PPL Act). The Minister may direct PPL to perform certain
tasks and evaluates PPL’s finances and staff salaries (Article 52 of the PPL Act and the
Supervision Note). When PPL was modernising the Chopin Airport and terminated the Lease
Agreements in that context, it was under the close control of the Ministry of Transport pursuant

to the Performance Agreement concluded between PPL and the Minister of Transport in 2010 to
modernise the Chopin Airport. Furthermore, under the PPL Act the national authorities “may
take decisions in respect of the activities of PPL” and PPL is required to carry out tasks
commissioned by the Minister”. (Articles 3, and 4(2), and 52 of the PPL Act). It is protected from
bankruptcy (Article 7 of the PPL Act). Its property is “part of national property”, which it has to
protect (Article 8 of the PPL Act). Contrary to Respondent’s allegations that State control is in
fact not exercised in practice, the Ministry’s supervision and control is structural and remains
very substantial.

 

On the other hand, the PPL Act, as well as_the Polish Act on State-Owned Enterprises, states
that PPL is “an independent, self-governing and self-financing organizational unit of the national
economy, operating in the scope and on the terms specified in this Act” and that it has “legal
personality” (Article 2 of the PPL Act). It conducts “its business operations independently, based
on its own plans” — although “in line with the objectives of the national socio-economic
development plan” (Article 6 of the PPL Act).

 

However, compared to the many restrictions and forms of government control and interference,
the above expressions of quasi-independence and quasi-autonomy do not tip the scales.

Respondent erroneously alleges that “account must be taken of [a State’s] national rights to
determine whether or not an entity is a State organ”.°” Article 4(2) of the ILC Articles, however,
only provides that entities, which in accordance with the internal law of a State are qualified as
State-organs, are State organs for purpose of State responsibility; it does not per se exclude
entities which are not qualified as State organs under domestic law. In other words, although
under Article 4(2), an entity is a State organ when it has such status attributed to it under domestic
law, the circumstance that an entity is not considered a State organ under domestic law does not
prevent that entity from being considered as such under international law for State responsibility
purposes. Besides, under Article 3 of the ILC Articles, “[t]he characterization of an act of a State
as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected
by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.”

For its assessment of whether PPL may be considered to be a de facto State organ whose acts and
omissions are attributable to Poland, the Tribunal has attached much importance to the
declaration from Mr. Zbigniew Rynasiewicz, the Secretary of State in the Ministry of Transport,
who stated before the Polish Parliament in 2011 that “[PPL] is an enterprise which is functioning
within the structure of the Ministry of [Transport]”."”’ He moreover confirmed in 2013 that the
Ministry of Transport was participating in the modernisation of the Chopin Airport by saying:
“[w]hen it comes to questions on investments [...] the supervision over PPL’s action is exercised
by the minister responsible for transport and in a way we are also responsible for all issues
connected with the functioning of the enterprise [PPL] — at the Chopin Airport in Warsaw”.>”*
That the Secretary of State is not a legislator does not alter the fact that the highest Polish
authorities confirmed before the Polish Parliament that PPL functioned within the structure of
the Ministry of Transport, which itself — through PPL — was participating in the modernisation of

the Chopin Airport.

Considering all these elements, the Tribunal concludes that PPL is indeed a de facto State organ
whose acts and omissions are attributable to Respondent.

Ex abundantia, the Tribunal notes that even if PPL were not considered to be a State organ under
Article 4 of the ILC Articles, it was in any event exercising governmental authority. Indeed, as
Respondent confirmed, PPL was performing “strategic functions for the existence of the State”
and had “general defense obligations”. *”” Moreover, the operation and modernisation of Chopin
Airport was carried out by PPL in the exercise of governmental authority. In fact, the PPL Act
entrusted PPL expressly with the modernisation of airport terminals (Article 4 of the PPL Act).
Consequently, the acts PPL committed in the framework of the modernisation of Terminal 1 of
Chopin Airport, including the decision to terminate the Lease Agreements, were carried out in
the exercise of the governmental task, delegated by the PPL Act. Besides, the Secretary of State
of the Ministry of Transport had confirmed that the modernisation of Terminal 1 was a
governmental matter in which his Ministry was involved through PPL, as already noted at
paragraphs 360 and 434 above.**”

Consequently, if PPL would not have been a State organ, alternatively for the purpose of Article
5 of the ILC Articles, the Tribunal accepts that PPL is an entity empowered by the law of Poland
to exercise elements of governmental authority.

Indeed, the ILC Commentary to Article 5 states that the provision extends to “such autonomous
institutions as exercise public functions of a legislative or administrative character” and adds
that:

[Of particular importance will be not just the content of the powers, but the way they are
conferred on an entity, the purpose for which they are to be exercised, and the extent to
which the entity is accountable to government for its exercise.**!

The Ministry of Transport, by statutory provisions, delegated to PPL the task of modernising and
operating Polish airports, controlled PPL, and held it accountable for the exercise of its powers.
It is thus an entity exercising governmental authority, as envisaged by Article 5 of the ILC
Articles.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal draws support from the ILC Commentary which state
that “entities” may be State organs under Article 5:

The generic term ‘entity’ reflects the wide variety of bodies which, though not organs, may
be empowered by the law of a State to exercise elements of governmental authority. They
may include public corporations, semi-public entities, public agencies of various kinds and
even, in special cases, private companies, provided that in each case the entity is empowered
by the law if the State to exercise functions of a public character normally exercised by State
organs, and the conduct of the entity relates to the exercise of the governmental authority
concerned.

441. The Tribunal refers also to Bosh, in which the tribunal still considered the University of Kiev for
the purpose of Article 5 of the ILC Articles as an entity which exercises governmental authority,
even though it exercised substantially less of a public function than PPL and — unlike PPL — as
an academic institution, had less governmental control and a much more autonomy .**?

442. Taking into account the public functions, inter alia, within the domain of public defence, and
other powers which have been conferred upon PPL by legislative act, the scope of governmental
control, and the crucial role for international communications and connections of the airport from
the Polish capital, the Tribunal concludes that PPL exercised governmental authority
implementing the necessary modernisation of Terminal 1, and deciding on the fate of its Lease
Agreements in connection therewith.

443. The next issue the Tribunal has to address is whether PPL’s conduct with regard to the
modernisation of Terminal 1 and its related conduct with regard to the Lease Agreements relates
to the exercise of governmental authority.

444. The Tribunal is aware that in Bosh, the tribunal considered that the university did not exercise
governmental authority when handling a contract for the renovation and development of the
university campus and terminating it. The reason for this was that the university was empowered
to act fully independently in this matter and that the handling of this contract was a mere private
or commercial activity.**

445. The Tribunal, however, notes that the PPL Act included the construction, extension and
maintenance of airport terminals in PPL’s scope of activities, and that the Performance
Agreement concluded between PPL and the Minister of Transport in 2010 to modernise Chopin
Airport subjected the modernisation of Terminal | to control by the Ministry.*** In addition, the
Secretary of State of the Ministry of Transport specifically acknowledged in Parliament
responsibility for the modernisation of Terminal | of the Chopin Airport.**°

446. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that prior to concluding the Lease Agreements with BH Travel,
PPL needed the approval of the State Treasury due to provisions set forth in the State Treasury
Act applicable to State-owned entities. **’ The need for the State Treasury’s consent was
acknowledged by PPL to BH Travel on a number of occasions. *** As already mentioned, the
State Treasury required PPL to obtain approval for: (i) the Lease Agreements, (ii) certain

amendments to the Lease Agreements, and (iii) a temporary rent reduction regarding one of the
stores operated by BH Travel (see above, para. 57).*’ Consequently, unlike the University of
Kiev, PPL acted under governmental authority in respect of the Lease Agreements.

447. Under Article 5 of the ILC Articles, PPL’s conduct with regard to the modernisation of

Terminal 1, including the connected termination of the Lease Agreements, should thus be
considered an act of State under international law, which may trigger Poland’s international
responsibility.

448. The Tribunal has decided that PPL’s acts and omissions with regard to the modernisation of

Terminal | and the termination of the Lease Agreements are attributable to Respondent on the
basis of the documents submitted to the Tribunal. The Tribunal therefore does not need to draw
negative inferences to conclude attribution, as Claimant has requested, although Respondent’s
persistent refusal to comply with the Tribunal’s document production orders would have justified
doing so.

B. Fair and Equitable Treatment

449. Article 3(2) of the Treaty provides that:

Investments and return of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded
fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.>”°

1) The Standard of ‘Fair and Equitable Treatment’

Claimant’s Position

450. Claimant argues that Respondent violated the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard in

Article 3(2) of the Treaty by: (i) abusively implementing pretextual measures in violation of its

dispute in good faith; (iii) implementing arbitrary and coercive measures in violation of
court-ordered injunctions; and (iv) denying BH Travel due process with respect to the Governor
of Mazovia’s decision.°'

 

Claimant submits that the FET standard requires that States treat investors in a just, even-handed,
unbiased, and legitimate manner, a standard which is well-established in investment treaty
jurisprudence.*” Further, Claimant explains that the FET standard has evolved to encompass a
number of widely-recognised “concrete principles” which oblige States to: (i) act in good faith;
(ii) not act in a manner that is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or
lacking in due process; (iii) respect procedural propriety and due process; and (iv) respect the
investor’s reasonable and legitimate expectations.*°

452. Claimant submits that Flemingo Group acquired BH Travel with the expectation that BH Travel
would continue to operate in Terminals | and 2 both during and after the modernisation period.**
Claimant admits that the Flemingo Group was “generally aware” of the modernisation plans of
Terminal 1.°°° Nevertheless Claimant asserts that the Flemingo Group’s expectations were
reasonable and legitimate in view of the guaranteed periods of lease in the terms of the Lease
Agreements and the Flemingo Group’s experience in the duty-free industry.*°°

453. Claimant contends further that a breach of the FET standard can result from “a series of
circumstances” and “need not necessarily arise out of individual isolated acts”.*"’ Claimant adds
that there can be “creeping violations” of the FET standard, which the E/ Paso v. Argentina
tribunal described as “a process extending over time and comprising a succession or an
accumulation of measures which, taken separately, would not breach that standard but, when
taken together, do lead to such a result”.*

454. Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s position that the definition of the FET standard is entirely
left to the discretion of individual tribunals. Claimant indicates several “concrete principles”
which tribunals have referred to when applying the standard,’ demonstrating that the FET
standard goes further than the obligation to treat investors “in a manner that is predictable”.° In
Saluka, the tribunal specified that “[iJn their ordinary meaning, the terms ‘fair’ and ‘equitable’
mean ‘just’, ‘even-handed’, ‘unbiased’, ‘legitimate’” and that a breach of this obligation implies
“treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is
unacceptable from the international perspective”.“' Claimant also refers to the definition of the
FET standard provided by the tribunal in Tecmed v. Mexico:

The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity
and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know
beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the
goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its
investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such
criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the
resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations. The
foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e., without arbitrarily
revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by
the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and
business activities. The investor also expects the State to use the legal instruments that
govern the actions of the investor or the investment in conformity with the function usually

assigned to such instruments, and not to deprive the investor of its investment without the
required compensation.

455. Claimant further points to the role that tribunals have attached to the duty of good faith in their
application of the FET standard, treating it as “a basic obligation of the State” which precludes
an abuse of rights.“ Referring to Frontier Petroleum v. Czech Republic, Claimant asserts that
“[b]ad faith action by the host state includes the use of legal instruments for purposes other than
those for which they were created”. Various tribunals have also held that measures involving
arbitrariness or discrimination constitute distinct breaches of the FET standard,“ specifying that
measures are arbitrary when they are implemented “without engaging in a rational
decision-making process”.’ The FET standard further requires the State to refrain from
“exercising coercion” and to provide due process.”

456. Claimant contends that Article 3(2) of the Treaty sets out an “autonomous” FET standard which
does not depend on the treatment given to the nationals of the host State, as Respondent contends.
Claimant therefore criticises Respondent for “confound[ing] the [FET] standard under
Article 3(2) of the BIT with the national treatment standard under Article 4(1) of the BIT”.°"°

Respondent's Position

457. Respondent submits that the FET standard “has never had a uniform definition” and that tribunals
have adopted their own definitions for their particular proceedings.°''! Respondent argues that
host States are not required under the principle of FET to accord a specific standard of treatment
to foreign entities. Instead, FET requires a host State to treat foreign entities in a predictable
manner, and in principle, equal to the treatment that national entities receive.°””

458. Respondent also states that the Flemingo Group was “fully aware” of the planned modernisation

of Terminal | and its possible consequences even before acquiring the shares in Baltona.°*
Respondent states that PPL implemented actions against other businesses at Chopin Airport
similar to those taken against BH Travel. For instance, Claimant states that the Governor of
Mazovia initiated enforcement activities against HDS and Keraniss, both direct competitors of
BH Travel. However, unlike BH Travel, HDS and Keraniss vacated the premises they occupied.
Both companies also regained the leases for those premises through a tender after the

 

modernisation of Terminal 1.°

459. In addition, Respondent contends that business entities operating in Poland are only guaranteed
those means of protection granted to them by law — and not more. Those protections include the
ability to bring claims before independent Polish courts, which, Respondent submits, Claimant
had successfully exercised.°'* Respondent adds further that BH Travel not only sent letters to
Polish ministries, it also received a number of freezing orders from Polish courts. Respondent
also notes that BH Travel filed an action against PPL for compensation with respect to some of
the terminated Lease Agreements. As such, Respondent argues that this is a dispute between two
private entities, and thus should be decided by the Polish courts.°!”

2) Whether Respondent abusively implemented pretextual measures to justify termination
of the Lease Agreements in violation of its duties of good faith, transparency, and
candour

Claimant’s Position

460. Claimant points out that all duty-free shop leases in Terminal 1 had to be discontinued to allow
PPL to proceed with the planned modernisation of Terminal | based on the schedule approved
by the European Union as a condition for co-financing the project."

461. This discontinuation affected BH Travel’s Lease Agreements. In accordance with international
and Polish law, Article 27 of the Airport Act provided for the termination of the lease agreements
affected by the closure of Terminal | for modernisation and for compensation of “any loss
resulting from the termination of agreements”.

462. According to Claimant, PPL tried to avoid payment of this compensation, by repeatedly

attempting to persuade BH Travel to agree to terminate the leases without compensation"? and

guarantees.” For instance, Claimant points out that “PPL maintained in bad faith that BH Travel
had irrevocably ‘agreed’ at the 8 December 2011 meeting to renounce its rights under the relevant
leases without any compensation and to vacate the premises by 31 July 2012”.! Claimant
maintains that PPL refused to engage with BH Travel about the terms of any possible settlement,
and furthermore disputes Respondent’s claim that BH Travel frustrated any opportunity for
amicable settlement.” Claimant adds that PPL’s attempt to revise the DFZ Rules to include the
modernisation as a ground for revoking a duty-free permit “further confirms that PPL was
desperate to evict BH Travel by any means possible”.

463. Terminal | had to be shut down in July 2012 to have the modernisation completed by the end of
2014 in order to retain the funds allocated by the CEUTP. Claimant submits that when it became
clear that BH Travel would not accept termination without compensation, PPL started a campaign
to uncover a possible violation of the Lease Agreements that it could rely upon to terminate the

leases unilaterally without compensation.°*

 

464. On 16 February 2012, Respondent issued 11 separate Notices of Termination to terminate the
Lease Agreements with immediate effect on the basis of two alleged breaches of contract by
BH Travel: failure to adjust the value of bank guarantees, and failure to deliver insurance policies
within the 14-day deadline.

465. Claimant argues that these two bases that PPL relied on when it terminated the Lease Agreements
were pretextual and were relied on in bad faith to force BH Travel from Chopin Airport without
compensation. In addition, the Minister of Transport admitted that BH Travel’s Lease
Agreements were terminated due to the anticipated modernisation of Terminal 1.°°°

466. Moreover, Claimant submits that PPL did not have a basis to terminate the Lease Agreements

0 Claimant cites to I Mr. [MMs testimony in order to claim that PPL did not offer BH Travel “any
guarantees” that if the Lease Agreements were terminated amicably, BH Travel would receive space in the
new terminal. See Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 131, referring to Hearing Transcript (13 October
2015), 90:2-5. Claimant submits that [ll Mr. [PN]’s testimony also confirmed that PPL could not provide
guarantees that BH Travel would win the tender for premises in the new terminal. See Claimant’s Post-Hearing

under the Treaty, the Lease Agreements,’ or their governing law (Polish law).* Specifically
with respect to the Lease Agreements, Claimant contends that they did not provide a basis for
termination based on the planned modernisation of Terminal 1. The Lease Agreements did not
contain any “demolition clause” that would have entitled Respondent to terminate the agreements
due to modernisation.°”

467. As already noted (see paras. 166-190 above), Claimant also denies that the grounds for
termination of the Lease Agreements listed in the Notices of Termination were valid.

468. First, PPL had invoked Article 13(1)(c) of the General Lease Conditions. Article 13(1)(c)
provides: “[t]he Lessor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect in
the case of: [...] c) failure to submit (non-payment), complete, or renew the bank guarantee
(deposit) under the terms specified in the Agreement.”

469. Article 4(1) of the Lease Agreements provides:

The Lessee undertakes to adjust the amount of bank guarantee accordingly in the event of
change in the minimum leasing fee in accordance with § 3 section 2, or in the case of change
in the area in accordance with the “Control Quantity Survey Protocol”, within 14 days from
the date of change.®!

470. On 1 February 2012, the minimum leasing fees were escalated by mi. in accordance with
Article 3(2) of the Lease Agreements. As such, BH Travel was required to adjust the value of the
bank guarantees by 15 February 2012. On 16 February 2012, the termination notices were issued
by PPL. Invoking Polish law principles of contract interpretation, Claimant argues that “failure
to ‘adjust’ the bank guarantees to the rent escalation [...] does not constitute a ground for

termination under Article 13(1)(c)” which refers only to failures to “submit”, “complete”, and
“renew”.°” Claimant further argues that it would be unreasonable and contrary to the interests of

both parties to interpret Article 13(1)(c) in this way.°*

471. Second, PPL had invoked Article 13(1)(d) of the General Lease Conditions which provides that
“[t]he Lessor shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect in the case
of: [...] d) failure to submit certified true copies of insurance policies, as well failure to renew the

©7 Statement of Claim, para. 169.

8 Claimant submits that “[i]t is [...] not necessary for the Tribunal to find that the pretextual termination of BH
Travel’s Lease Agreements was unlawful under Polish law in order to conclude that the Respondent failed to
accord the Claimant’s investment fair and equitable treatment under the BIT”. See Claimant’s Post-Hearing
Brief, para. 164, referring to El Paso v. Argentina, para. 135, Exhibit CL-14. Furthermore, Claimant states
that prior tribunals have confirmed that municipal law “is relevant in assessing the alleged arbitrariness of the
State measures at issue”. See Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 165, referring to Siemens A.G. v. The
Argentine Republic, Award dated 6 February 2007, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8 (“Siemens v. Argentina

said insurance policies”.°*

Article 6 of the Lease Agreements provides that “[t]he Lessee shall be obliged to provide the
Lessor within 14 days from the date of signing the first ‘Delivery/Acceptance Protocol’ with a
certified true copy of the civil liability insurance policy regarding liability for activities carried
out in the subject matter of the lease [...]”.

Article 11(4) of the General Lease Conditions required BH Travel to present new insurance
policies for the upcoming year at least 14 days before the expiration of the existing insurance
policies:

Insurance policies shall be valid for a period of at least 12 consecutive months from the date
of issue. In each case, at least 14 days before the end of another 12-month period, the Lessee
shall submit to the Lessor the certified true copy of the subsequent insurance contract, valid
for a further 12 consecutive months period.

Claimant argues that Article 13(1)(d) stipulates two separate and independent events of default
with respect to BH Travel’s obligations concerning liability and insurance: (i) the failure to
submit certified copies of insurance policies; and (ii) the failure to renew insurance policies. In
Claimant’s view, the plain terms of Article 13(1)(d) confirm that the Parties did not intend to
qualify the failure to submit copies of renewed policies as a ground for termination with
immediate effect. Claimant notes that BH Travel had obtained and submitted an insurance policy
for all its premises at Chopin Airport valid up to and including 29 February 2012. On 14 February
2012, more than two weeks before the end of the termination of the prior insurance policy, BH
Travel had duly renewed its insurance policy for the following 12 month period. As such, it is
Claimant’s view that there is no breach that could have triggered Article 13(1)(d) of the General
Lease Conditions. Claimant submits that this interpretation is consistent with the leniency shown
by PPL in its prior commercial dealings with BH Travel.

In addition, Claimant submits that using an alleged one-day delay in the submission of certified
copies of the insurance to justify termination is absurd, especially given that the stores were
insured. In any event, Claimant states that there was no one-day delay. Claimant explains that
because the prior policy was valid until 29 February 2012, expiring on 1 March 2012, the copies
submitted by BH Travel on 16 February 2012 were within the 14-day advance deadline
(including 29 February in its 14-day count backwards to 16 February).

Claimant further submits that under Polish law the termination constitutes a violation of PPL’s
duty of good faith under Articles 5 and 58(2) of the Polish Civil Code and is therefore null and
void.

Article 5 of the Polish Civil Code provides:
One cannot exercise a right in a manner which would contradict its socioeconomic purpose

or the principles of community life. Such an act or omission on the part of the person shall
not be considered the exercise of that right and shall not be protected.

Article 58(2) of the Polish Civil Code Provides that “[a]n act in law [juridical act] which is
inconsistent with the principles of community life shall be null and void”. °*

477. Claimant submits that under Polish law, the breach invoked to terminate the agreement must be
sufficiently serious to justify the termination.*” In Claimant’s view, the termination of the Lease
Agreements based on BH Travel’s failure to adjust the value of the bank guarantees to the mm.
rent escalation by 15 February 2012 is “entirely disproportionate considering the value of the
adjustment in comparison with the aggregate value of the bank guarantees, the length of the delay
and the contracting parties’ common intention to conclude long-term agreements”. As such,
Claimant submits that PPL’s Notices of Termination did not effectively terminate BH Travel’s
Lease Agreements.”

478. Claimant submits that the Polish Courts have confirmed that the termination of BH Travel’s
Lease Agreements was wrongful under Polish law.“! Claimant notes that the Court of Appeal
observed in two separate injunction proceedings that the terms of the General Lease Conditions
did not give PPL the right to terminate the Lease Agreements unilaterally based on a mere failure
to adjust the value of the bank guarantees,” or on an alleged failure to submit certified copies of
its insurance policies by the established deadline.“ Claimant reiterates its view that PPL could

exercise its right to terminate the Lease Agreements during the guaranteed periods of lease only

on the basis of a material breach.**

479. According to Claimant, “[t]he decisions of the Court of Appeal in the injunctive proceedings [...]

confirm that PPL’s Notices of Termination were on their face baseless and contrived”.“*
Claimant acknowledges that the Tribunal is not bound by the decisions of local courts, but
submits that the decisions of Polish courts “may inform the Tribunal’s understanding of the scope
and content of PPL and BH Travel’s contractual obligations, and give the Tribunal comfort in
finding that the termination of the Lease Agreements on 16 February 2012 was both ill-grounded

and abusive”.

is inherent in the FET standard.“ This duty, Claimant explains, prevents a host State from
“exercising a right or using a legal instrument for reasons other than those for which the right or
the legal instrument were created”.“* In addition, Claimant contends that the duty of good faith
forbids a host State from “implementing measures for reasons other than those communicated to

the investor”.“° Claimant further points out that a number of tribunals have held that the duty of
650

good faith also manifests itself in the “general prohibition of abuse of rights”.

481. Claimant argues that the duty of good faith inherent in the FET standard “precludes the State
from exercising a right or using a legal instrument for reasons other than those for which the right
or the legal instrument were created”.°'! The absence of a legitimate contractual basis for
termination, and the evidence that the Lease Agreements were terminated for reasons other than
the ones listed in the Notices of Termination compels the conclusion that the termination was
malicious and abusive, amounting to breach of the FET standard, Claimant argues.°?

482. Referring to the events and correspondence that took place between 2 July 2010 and 16 February
2012, as well as to the quent judicial and administrative decisions,°? Claimant
that Respondent exercised its right to terminate the Lease Agreements “for reasons other than
those for which those rights were created, and for reasons other than those communicated to the
Claimant”.° Central to the assessment of whether Respondent complied with the FET standard
— Claimant concludes — is “[t]he legitimacy and reasonableness of PPL’s stated basis for
termination [of the Lease Agreements]”.°* It is Claimant’s view that the grounds invoked by
Respondent “were on their face baseless and contrived”.*°°

treatment should take into account the alleged prior breaches of the Lease Agreements by
BH Travel. According to Claimant, these alleged breaches “are entirely irrelevant to the

alleged breaches were not invoked as grounds for termination in February 2012”.°7
Respondent's Position

Respondent denies that the reason for PPL’s termination of the Lease Agreements was the
planned modernisation of Terminal 1.* For Respondent, PPL had every right to terminate the
Lease Agreements in light of BH Travel’s breaches.® BH Travel was improperly performing its
obligations under the Lease Agreements even before it was acquired by the Flemingo Group,
after which the situation purportedly did not improve despite assurances from the Flemingo
Group that it would.°°

Respondent contends that PPL utilised its right to terminate the Lease Agreements according to
their intended purpose and in compliance with the law. For Respondent, “[t]he BIT does not force
the host State to maintain legal relations contrary to its economic interests and incurring a loss”.
Respondent refers to Frontier Petroleum, a case also cited by Claimant, to assert that use of legal
instruments in accordance with their intended purpose does not constitute a breach of a bilateral
investment treaty.°*!

Respondent adds that even if the modernisation of Terminal | was the reason for the termination,
“the Flemingo Group should have expected the future termination of the Lease Agreements”.“
Respondent emphasises in this regard that the Flemingo Group was aware of the planned
modernisation when it acquired BH Travel, noting that the due diligence report prepared before
the purchase of Baltona’s shares mentioned the possibility that the Lease Agreements could be
terminated because of that modernisation project.°*

Respondent further emphasises that the Lease Agreements did not provide guaranteed lease terms
or ensure that Claimant could conduct business in Terminal | until 2018.% Indeed, the
contractual provisions that Claimant relies on do not provide for guaranteed lease terms but
instead “primarily provided for the usual procedure for terminating agreements concluded for an
indefinite term — with a notice period of three months”.

Respondent admits that the Lease Agreements also stated that PPL could only make use of this
general right to terminate the agreements after 84 months (7 years) from the date of signature,“
but stresses that the General Lease Conditions (which is an appendix to the Lease Agreements)
listed five specific instances that allowed PPL to terminate the Lease Agreements immediately.°%
Among others, the General Lease Conditions provided that PPL could immediately terminate the

Lease Agreements if BH Travel fails to submit a bank guarantee on the conditions stipulated in
the agreements and/or if it fails to submit certified copies of the renewed insurances policies.”

489. According to Respondent, these two grounds for termination have occurred and the termination
of the Lease Agreements was thus effective as of 16 May 2012 at the latest. In this regard
Respondent submits that the provisions of the Lease Agreements on termination did not conflict
with those included in the General Lease Conditions because “[t]hey purely regulated the rights
of the parties in the event of the emergence of various situations”. Respondent further explains
that “[t]he Lease Agreements regulated matters of ordinary termination, while the provisions of
the [General Lease Conditions] provided for solutions in the event of an extraordinary situation,
such as the improper performance of the Lease Agreements by the lessee”.°

490. As already noted (see paras. 166-190 above), Respondent submits that it was entitled to terminate
the Lease Agreements under Article 13(1)(c) of the General lease Conditions since BH Travel
failed to present bank guarantees taking into account the new minimum rent for the Lease
Agreements by 15 February 2016 as required by Article 4(2) of the Lease Agreements.
Respondent explains that under Polish banking law, the bank guarantee could only have been
effectively adjusted to the revalued rent through the delivery of a new guarantee to PPL.
Respondent maintains that “having a bank guarantee for 3 times the current rent throughout the
term of the Lease Agreements was the essence of BH Travel’s obligations regarding the securing
of the [L]ease Agreements”.°” Respondent dismisses Claimant’s argument that the word “adjust”
does not appear in Article 13(1)(c), arguing that “adjusting” falls under “submitting” or
“completing” the bank guarantees.°”'

 

491. Respondent also submits that it was entitled to terminate the Lease Agreements under
Article 13(d) of the General Lease Conditions, as BH travel had failed to present copies of new
insurance policies at least 14 days before the end of the period of validity of the old policy (as
required by Article 11(4) of the General Lease Conditions). Respondent argues in this regard that
the deadline for filing copies of new insurance policies expired on 15 February 2012, explaining
that under Polish law, in order to calculate a deadline before an event one starts counting from
the day preceding the event.°”

492. Accordingly, in Respondent’s view, the termination of the Lease Agreements was not pretextual
but fully justified by the actions of BH Travel (i.e., failure to provide bank guarantees, insurance
policies, report revenues properly, make timely payments, and perform marketing obligations)
and the conditions stipulated in the Lease Agreements allowing for termination. Respondent

658 Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 115. Respondent explains its reference to 16 May 2012 as the latest
date on which the Lease Agreements would have been valid, by stating that even if there us been no grounds
for termination the Lease Agreements, Articles 365 and 673 of the Polish Civil Code would have allowed PPL
to cancel on 3 months’ notice. As such, the termination of the Lease Agreements would have been effective
as of 16 May 2012 at the latest as a result of the notices of Termination served 3 months before. Respondent,
admits, however, that termination on such grounds would have given rise to liability for damages. See

maintains that the termination was not an abuse of rights as BH Travel’s breach of the Lease
Agreements was ongoing. Respondent emphasises that PPL had contractual grounds for
termination of the Lease Agreements without compensation and without need for recourse to the
provisions of the Airport Act.°%
a breach is irrelevant to termination rights.

Respondent adds that under Polish law, the extent or severity of

493. Respondent argues that the Court of Appeal decisions cited by Claimant, which stated that the
termination had been abusive, have no bearing in the present proceedings. According to
Respondent, they were merely simplified injunction proceedings. In injunction proceedings,
Respondent explains, a party only needs to show that there is a risk of loss and the court will
decide within a couple of days. Respondent contends that it is impossible for the court to analyse
the material correctly as in these cases, no witn $ or experts were heard. Furthermore,
Respondent points out that the proceedings Claimant referred to concerned possessory issues and
not the termination of the Lease Agreements. Accordingly, they did not look into the legality of
termination of the Lease Agreements.”

 

494. Respondent notes that Claimant bases its claim for abusive termination of the Lease Agreements
on Article 5 of the Polish Civil Code, but argues that this provision cannot constitute the basis of
a claim. According to Respondent, the correct provision would be Article 58(2) of the Polish
Civil Code, which provides inter alia that a “juridical act that is contrary to the principles of
community existence, shall be invalid”.°”°

495. Respondent submits that Articles 5 and 58(2) of the Polish Civil Code are both properly treated
as clausula generalis, have to be interpreted narrowly in Polish law, and can only be applied in
exceptional circumstances,°”

namely where the disputed actions are unacceptable due to

496. In this context, Respondent observes that when assessing the termination of the Lease
Agreements, one should also take into account the previous non-performance of contract
obligations by BH Travel. Respondent asserts that under Polish law, an entity “which acts against
the rules of social conduct cannot effectively claim that the other party to the agreement breached
those rules while exercising its rights”. Consequently, BH Travel cannot accuse PPL of breaching
the rules of social conduct when, for the duration of the Lease Agreements, BH Travel breached
this rule and caused harm to PPL’s business. Respondent concludes that Claimant’s claim under
Articles 5 and 58(2) of the Polish Civil Code cannot erase the consequences of BH Travel’s “own.
neglect and non-performance of the Lease Agreements”.°”

497. Respondent finally observes that — even in the event the Termination Notice would be considered
unjustified under the contract provisions or under Article 58 of the Polish Civil Code — under

Polish law the termination notices would still ultimately be effective either: (i) on 16 May 2012
through the operation of Articles 365 and 673 of the Polish Civil Code (which allow for
termination on 3 months’ notice); or (ii) in July 2012 when the modernisation was approved by
the Governor of Mazovia. Respondent notes that in the former instance the lease periods in the
Lease Agreements would have been breached, giving rise to liability for damages, while in the
latter instance compensation would have been payable under the Airport Act.*°

3) Whether Respondent refused to negotiate a fair resolution of the dispute over the Lease
Agreements in good faith

Claimant’s Position

498. Claimant argues that Respondent violated the FET standard by consistently refusing to undertake
good faith negotiations with Claimant and its subsidiaries to resolve the dispute.°*! Claimant
submits that a number of investment treaty tribunals have held that a host State’s refusal to
undertake good faith negotiations to resolve a dispute is a breach of the FET standard.

499. Claimant submits that PPL falsely insisted that BH Travel had already accepted PPL’s proposal
of termination without compensation during the 8 December 2011 meeting. According to
Claimant, PPL knew at the time that the terms of its proposal could not have been, and were not,
accepted by BH Travel or Baltona.*

500. Claimant explains that BH Travel was willing to renegotiate the terms of the Lease Agreements
to accommodate PPL’s modernisation plans for Terminal 1, but according to Claimant, PPL
summarily rebuffed BH Travel’s suggestion. In Claimant’s view, PPL’s subsequent refusal to
consider BH Travel’s counter-proposal indicated that PPL’s offer to terminate the Lease
Agreements by mutual agreement was on a “take it or leave it” basis. Claimant thus contends that
PPL did not intend to engage with BH Travel in good faith negotiations."

501. Moreover, Claimant avers that the negotiations in July and August 2012 between PPL and
Claimant as well as its subsidiaries were conducted in bad faith.°*° PPL had first agreed, in
principle, to a settlement agreement under which new leases for premises in Terminals | and 2
would be concluded.**” Despite that, PPL reneged on that agreement when it asked the Governor

of Mazovia to order BH Travel to vacate Terminal 1 by 13 August 2012.°

502. Furthermore, Respondent did not reply to numerous letters that Claimant and its subsidiaries sent
to various ministries, including the Ministry of Transport.’ Claimant notes that Article 51 of the
PPL Act imposes a general obligation on the Minister of Transport to control the decisions of
PPL’s General Director and that Article 54 obligates the Minister to suspend the execution of a
decision by the General Director that is “contrary to law” and to “commit the General Director
to change [...] or repeal [his decision]”. Claimant avers that the Minister of Transport did not
take or even consider remedial action or conduct good faith negotiations.®'

503. Claimant claims that, at the hearing, Hi Mr. [MM] conceded that PPL had not engaged in good
faith negotiations in explaining that “it was very difficult to negotiate in good faith with a
company which treated us before courts of law in such a way”. According to Claimant,
BH Travel’s exercise of its right to seek protective relief before Polish courts in no way justifies

Respondent's failure to entertain good faith negotiations.

504. Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s allegation that “if it had agreed to negotiate with the
Claimant, then the Claimant would have ‘receive[d] a privileged position in comparison with
other investors”, submitting that the FET standard does not depend on the host State’s treatment
of other investors. Claimant also submits that it is not relevant for FET purposes that “Respondent

does not involve itself in private disputes”.°*

Respondent's Position

505. Respondent notes that BH Travel’s breaches of the Lease Agreements were the subject of
extensive correspondence and many meetings between BH Travel and PPL.®*

506. Respondent denies that it refused to hold negotiations in good faith to settle the dispute.
Respondent clarifies that it was PPL (which Respondent argues is not an emanation of Poland)
that negotiated with entities of the Flemingo Group. Respondent notes that it did not, for instance,
participate in the meeting between Baltona and PPL on 8 December 2011. Because PPL is a
private entity, Respondent submits that “Poland does not have any influence on PPL’s behaviour”
and that therefore it would have served no purpose to participate in the negotiations.°
Respondent further submits that because no illegal steps were taken by PPL, Respondent was not

obliged to take any action under the Airport Act.

507. Respondent further submits that, if it had negotiated with Claimant, that “would have be[en] a
kind of breach of [FET] treatment”. Respondent explains that such negotiations with Claimant
would have accorded it a “privileged position” compared to other investors “because Poland does
not enter into disputes (except for the provision of institutional capabilities for settling them)

between private entities which are independent of it”.

  
 

508. In Respondent’s view, it was willing to settle the dispute and engage in dialogue.* However, it
believes that Claimant in fact did not intend to amicably end the dispute as BH Travel
simultaneously initiated legal proceedings.” Respondent submits that Claimant launched these
proceedings to block the investment in Chopin Airport and used legal proceedings to exert
pressure on PPL to force it into a settlement. According to Respondent, these proceedings were
inconsistent with fundamental principles of law “in terms of acting in the defence of one’s
rights”.”"° Respondent submits that a number of tribunals have held that an “investment made in
breach of fundamental principles does not fall under BIT protection.”

4) Whether Respondent implemented arbitrary and coercive measures in violation of
court-ordered injunctions

Claimant’s Position

509. Claimant argues that a number of tribunals have held that the FET standard also prohibits
arbitrary and coercive measures.” Claimant submits that Respondent breached the FET standard
when it embarked on a “campaign of arbitrariness, coercion and harassment [...] to prevent BH
Travel from operating its stores at Chopin Airport in violation of court-ordered injunctions”.

510. Claimant notes, for example, that on 17 February 2012, which was the day after the Lease
Agreements were terminated, the Customs Chamber sealed all of BH Travel’s stores without
official notification or any indication of the legal basis for the closure.” Further, on 16 March
2012, customs authorities reopened BH Travel’s stores, again without any official notification or
indication of the legal basis for the reopening.” Claimant takes issue with Respondent’s

submission that BH Travel’s deliveries were blocked due to “Claimant’s failure to fulfil the
respective formalities”. According to Claimant PPL had ordered the Airport Security Guard
“not to let in any goods designated for BH Travel shops”.”” Claimant adds that the timing of
PPL’s “security inspections” was part of “the campaign of intimidation and harassment that the

Respondent waged to force BH Travel out of Chopin Airport”.”*

 

 

511. Claimant argues that despite the issuance of a court injunction ordering PPL to permit BH Travel
to stock and sell goods in its stores, PPL still stymied BH Travel’s efforts to resume normal
operation of its stores.””

512. Claimant avers that PPL’s purported failure to comply with the injunctions issued by Polish
courts is itself a denial of justice which constitutes a breach of the FET standard.”!° Indeed,
Claimant notes that investment treaty tribunals have held that a host State violates the FET
standard when it fails to comply with decisions rendered by its own courts.”!!

513. Claimant submits that Respondent’s argument that Claimant “ha[s] not brought any proceedings
[...] to find that the termination of the Lease Agreements [was] ineffective” is irrelevant for the
determination of whether Respondent has breached the FET standard.”””

Respondent's Position

514. For its part, Respondent submits that the measures PPL undertook against Claimant were not
coercive or arbitrary since the Lease Agreements were terminated in accordance with the law.
According to Respondent, PPL merely protected its rights as the owner of the premises.
Respondent notes that no judgment has established that PPL “broke the law” by terminating those
agreements.”!>

515. Respondent explains that the reason for preventing deliveries to BH Travel’s stores on 19 and
21 March 2012 was that BH Travel had failed to comply with the “simple” formal requirements
which apply to all businesses at Chopin Airport.’'* BH Travel, so Respondent submits, had not
given airport authorities the appropriate notification, which is why airport authorities “had every
right and duty to stop the deliver[ies]”.”'5

516. With respect to access for BH Travel’s employees, Respondent denies that PPL withdrew passes
that authorised BH Travel’s employees from gaining access to restricted sections of Chopin
Airport.” Respondent notes that, after the termination of the Lease Agreements, PPL notified
BH Travel that passes would be maintained only for BH Travel employees who were involved
in returning BH Travel’s leased premises to PPL. Respondent contends that “[a]ccess of BH
Travel’s employees to an extent exceeding the process of returning premises would be
inconsistent with the generally applicable laws”, including the Aviation Law of 3 July 2002 and
the Regulation of the Council of Ministers of 19 June 2007 on the National Civil Security
Programme.”!”

517. Similarly, Respondent submits that the security inspections were of a “routine nature” taken by
PPL as manager of Chopin Airport." Respondent also submits that the discontinuation of
electricity supply was due to non-payment by BH Travel.”

518. Respondent argues that BH Travel could make use of legal protections equal to those found in
other democratic States, and had the free choice to use them.”” In that regard, Respondent notes
that BH Travel sought to enforce its rights by initiating approximately 90 different legal
proceedings against PPL.”

519. Respondent notes further that these legal proceedings were aimed primarily at maintaining
possession of the premises at Chopin Airport and putting “economic pressure on PPL to forc[e]
PPL to make concessions for BH Travel” by threatening the planned modernisation of
Terminal 1. They did not seek a finding that the termination of the Lease Agreements was
ineffective.”

A L..-] [and] its ined ign of and coercive measures””> —
procured the assistance of the Governor of Mazovia in evicting BH Travel, without affording BH
Travel due process or paying it compensation.”°

   

521. Claimant recalls that on 14 May 2012, PPL submitted an ex parte motion to the Governor of
Mazovia requesting that permission be granted for the execution of Terminal 1’s modernisation
pursuant to the Airport Act.”’ The Governor of Mazovia granted that request on 10 July 2012,
and on 26 July 2012 issued another decision confirming the “immediate enforceability” of his
prior decision.”* On 7 August 2012, the Governor of Mazovia ordered BH Travel to vacate its
premises in Chopin Airport,” and on 14 August 2012, BH Travel was evicted from the Chopin
Airport.”°

 

522. Claimant contends that BH Travel was denied the opportunity to contest the Governor of
Mazovia’s administrative decision.”! BH Travel was not given any notice of PPL’s request to
the Governor of Mazovia and was not afforded an opportunity to comment on that request before
the decision of 10 July 2012.” Furthermore, Claimant avers that it was not given the right to
challenge the decision within the appeal procedure provided for under the Airport Act.”

Claimant notes that the Minister of Transport, the Administrative Court, and the Supreme

Administrative Court all held that BH Travel had no standing to challenge the Governor of

Mazovia’s decision, thus depriving BH Travel of any remedy.”*

523. It is Claimant’s view that the eviction on 14 August 2012 breached BH Travel’s “right to remain
in possession of its stores [...] and to continue to operate [them]” — rights which were protected
at the time since on their basis Polish courts had granted BH Travel injunctive relief against
PPL.”

Respondent's Position

524. Respondent argues that the Governor of Mazovia did not deprive BH Travel of any rights by
issuing the decision of 10 July 2012, which only the Governor was authorised and obliged to
issue. On the contrary, Respondent submits, BH Travel’s refusal to return the premises to PPL
was a breach of PPL’s rights.”°

525. Respondent adds that under Polish administrative law BH Travel was not a party to the
administrative proceedings before the Governor of Mazovia because the Lease Agreements were
no longer in force. As such, BH Travel could not challenge the 10 July 2012 decision.” Because
BH Travel did not have the right to participate, the Governor of Mazovia, the Minister of
Transport, the Voivodship Administrative Court, and the Supreme Administrative Court did not
breach Claimant's rights.”*

526. Respondent considers that, upon PPL’s termination of the Lease Agreements, BH Travel’s
continued possession of the premises was groundless because it no longer had title to the formerly
leased premises. Under Polish law, a lease is merely a condition of dependent possession and a
right of contractual, not factual, nature. PPL was thus entitled to demand return of the premises.””

527. In any event, Respondent avers that Claimant and BH Travel in fact were able to challenge the
Governor’s decision and to protect their rights, if any. Fair and lawful proceedings were held
through a two-instance j jal-admini. ive p The ip courts luded.

however, that Claimant was not a party and therefore was not entitled to a remedy.”

 

528. Respondent observes, moreover, that Claimant did not initiate any proceedings challenging the
legality of the judicial-administrative proceedings leading to the Governor’s decision.
Respondent suggests that Claimant did not consider that those proceedings violated its rights
until the time came for Claimant to invoke alleged breaches under the Treaty.”#!

6) Tribunal’s Analysis

529. The Tribunal has to assess the facts of the case in light of Article 3(2) of the Treaty, which
provides:

Investments and return of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded
fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.

530. As stated in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the terms ‘fair’ and ‘equitable treatment’
provided in the Treaty require interpretation in accordance with their “ordinary meaning”.
Respondent’s statement that these terms have never had a uniform definition is correct in the
sense that these terms in their ordinary meaning do not refer to an established body of legal rules
which have to be respected. Respondent is equally correct when it remarks that tribunals have
applied the standard of “fair and equitable treatment” to the specific facts of each case.

531. However, Respondent is not correct when it argues that ‘fair and equitable treatment’ boils down
to treating foreign investors the same way as domestic and other foreign investors which also
operated businesses at Chopin Airport. Equal treatment with domestic and other foreign entities
is another specific standard, which is laid down in Article 4(1) of the Treaty: “[e]ach Contracting
Party shall accord to investments of Investors of the other Contracting Party, treatment which
shall not be less favourable than that accorded either to investments of its own investors or to
investments of investors of any third state”. It is not because the host State would treat all

539.

investors — domestic as well as foreign — in the same way that such treatment could not be unfair
or inequitable.

Besides, Respondent failed to submit any evidence about the actions undertaken against the other
shop-operators at Terminal 1, or about the conditions in which they allegedly resumed operations.
Consequently, Respondent did not sustain its argument that Claimant’s competitors had been
treated the same way as Claimant was.

Respondent puts much weight on the argument that it treated BH Travel in a predictable manner.
Respondent did not substantiate that BH Travel’s treatment (characterised by Claimant as unfair
and inequitable) was predictable when BH Travel entered into the Lease Agreements. More
important, however, is the fact that predictability is only one of the elements which contribute to
fair and equitable treatment.

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that many values other than predictability have been
recognised by investment treaty tribunals to be covered by the terms ‘fair and equitable
treatment’. Denial of justice, deficient review of administrative actions and the frustration of
legitimate expectations are, for instance, other elements which — as so many tribunals have
recognised — also constitute breaches of the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ obligation.”

 

 

As was stated in Saluka, ‘fair and equitable’ means “just”, “even-handed”, “unbiased”,
“legitimate”. Its assessment requires “a weighing of the [investor’s] legitimate and reasonable
expectations on the one hand and the [host State’s] legitimate regulatory interests on the other”.
When unjust or arbitrary treatment rises to a level that is unacceptable from the international
perspective the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ obligation is breached.”

The Tribunal observes that Article 3(2) of the Treaty requires fair and equal treatment “at all
times”. Claimant, referring to E/ Paso, is thus correct that a succession of acts — whether or not
individually significant — can build up to unfair and inequitable treatment until Article 3(2) is
breached.

Starting with the general context of the dispute, it was a fact that the duty-free shops in Terminal 1
in all events could not continue operations after July 2012 because the modernisation of Terminal
1 had to be finished at the end of 2014.

Moreover, the Polish Parliament had enacted a specific Airport Act of 12 February 2009 to
address the problems arising from such modernisation. Article 27 of the Airport Act provides
that the government permit to modernise provides grounds to terminate with immediate effect
the leases of duty-free shops affected by such works. But the Airport Act also provides that “loss
suffered as a result of termination of agreements [...] shall be subject to compensation”.

In the spring of 2009, plans for the modernisation of Terminal 1 were launched. By the summer
of 2010, PPL started to discuss solutions for the duty-free shops which would be affected by the
works. No specific proposals, however, could be made, because the exact timing of the works

was not yet known.

By the fall of 2011, it became obvious that modernisation of Terminal 1 would soon start. PPL
suggested to BH Travel at a meeting on 8 December 2011 that BH Travel should agree to
terminate the Lease Agreements for the Terminal 1 shops without compensation.

Although Respondent alleges the contrary, it provided no sustaining evidence to contradict
Claimant’s witnesses, who testified that BH Travel did not agree with this proposal. In fact, an
agreement to give up the shops without any compensation would have been inconsistent with the
substantial investments BH Travel had made for the installation and operation of the shops. The
facts confirm this lack of agreement.

A proposal of 4 January 2012 from BH Travel’s legal counsel to discuss the matter was rejected
by PPL on 13 January 2012.

Thereafter, the relations between PPL and BH Travel deteriorated. PPL inquired about
BH Travel’s maintenance of its website and about access to its IT system — enquiries PPL had
never made before. BH Travel started court actions to delay the start of the works until the dispute
about BH Travel’s stores was settled. Nevertheless, BH Travel continued to invite PPL to resume
discussions by letters dated 7 and 16 February 2012, but to no avail.

In the meantime, on 10 February 2012, PPL unsuccessfully tried once more to terminate the Lease
Agreements by asking BH Travel to sign a revised set of DFZ Rules, which would have allowed
termination because of modernisation works. BH Travel refused to sign.

On 16 February 2012, PPL terminated all BH Travel’s Lease Agreements with immediate effect
and demanded that the leased premises be returned within 30 days. The two grounds given for
all these terminations, based upon Articles 13(1)(c) and (d) of the General Lease Conditions,
were: (i) a failure to adjust the amounts of the bank guarantees to the increased rent for the Lease
Agreements; and (ii) failure to submit a certified copy of the relevant insurance policies in due
time. The Tribunal observes that PPL had previously been somewhat flexible with these
requirements, but that, as Hi Mr. [MM] stated at the hearing, PPL applied these requirements
strictly once there was no longer a good relationship between PPL and BH Travel.”

The Tribunal further notes that these two alleged failures, although listed as grounds for
termination in the General Lease Conditions, were not at all crucial for the operation of the shops
and were not essential elements of the long term Lease Agreements between BH Travel and PPL.

As already mentioned above (see paras. 170-173 above), the adjustment in its bank guarantee
that BH Travel failed to make only concerned an increase of x during a period of days.
Furthermore, these miniscule adjustments were due to be made on 15 February 2012. PPL did
not wait one full day before terminating the Agreements for BH Travel not having made these
adjustments motu proprio; nor did it warn and invite BH Travel to immediately adjust the
amounts. Claimant also raises the question of whether the right to terminate under Article
13(1)(c) should even apply to a failure to “adjust” a bank guarantee, as the wording of Article
13(1)(c) refers to a right to terminate for “failure to submit (non-payment), complete, or renew

the bank guarantee [...]” but does not use the word “adjust”.”"°

With respect to the second ground of termination (see paras. 174-176 above), BH Travel
submitted the certified copy of the insurance policies on 16 February 2012, which had been
renewed on 14 February 2012 — according to Respondent, they ought to have been submitted on
15 February 2012.” The Tribunal doubts whether the copies had indeed to be submitted on 15
February. Article 11(4) of the General Lease Conditions stated that “[i]insurance policies shall
be valid for a period of at least 12 consecutive months from the date of issue” and that “[i]n each
case, at least 14 days before the end of another 12-month period, the Lessee shall submit to the
Lessor the certified true copy of the subsequent insurance contract, valid for a further 12
consecutive months period”. The existing policies expired on 1 March 2012. As the year 2012
was a leap year with an extra 29 February, the copies had to be submitted on 16 February, as they
were.

The Tribunal has now to decide whether PPL’s actions constitute an abuse of PPL’s right to
terminate, and — as PPL’s actions and omissions are attributable to Respondent — a breach of the
FET obligation under Article 3(2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal has to carry out this assessment
under international law, as the FET obligation is a treaty obligation.

Assuming that PPL would have had the contractual right to terminate the Lease Agreements with
immediate effect (which already may be excluded for the alleged failure to submit certified copies
of the insurance policies), under international law the exercise of their right should not go
“beyond tolerable norms”.”**

As stated in Saluka, the investor’s legitimate and reasonable expectations should be weighed
against the host State’s legitimate regulatory interests.”

On the one hand, the Tribunal is aware that BH Travel and PPL were already in the fourth year
of an intense business relationship, which was intended to last seven to ten years and which
required important financial and operational commitments from BH Travel. Considering this
business relationship, the Tribunal would have considered it more than appropriate that PPL
would have informed BH Travel about easily remedied failures and invited it to do whatever was
required, especially as the alleged failures were of minor importance and would have had no
effect for two weeks.

On the other hand, even if PPL had the right to terminate, the Tribunal fails to see how in a normal
contractual relationship the failure to carry out on a specific day a minor adjustment of guaranteed
amounts to take effect two weeks later would lead to termination without advance warning or
possibility to remedy. The same goes for the non-submission of certified copies of insurance
policies which would enter into operation only two weeks later — if indeed not submitted in time
— quod non.

 

PPL used the contractual right to terminate for other reasons than those for which this right was

created. Indeed, it is obvious, and confirmed by PPL’s previous attempts, that PPL intended to
terminate the Lease Agreements without compensation because of the impending start of the
modernisation works — as was also admitted by the Minister of Transport. To that end, it invoked
in bad faith alleged contractual grounds to terminate the Lease Agreements with immediate effect
and without compensation. The Airport Act also provided for immediate termination, but with
compensation. PPL abused alleged contractual grounds to terminate the Lease Agreements
without compensation in order to avoid paying the compensation for which the Airport Act had
provided.

The Tribunal applies standards of international law to conclude that PPL abused its rights.
However, it is comforted by the fact that courts in Warsaw, including the Court of Appeal, have
decided in two separate injunction proceedings that PPL’s terminations were prima facie an abuse
of right under Polish law. The Tribunal is aware that injunction proceedings under Polish law are
only prima facie decisions and do not involve a final determination of the merits. Nevertheless,
the Polish decisions indicate that, also under Polish law, the terminations were — prima facie —
an abuse of right.

Respondent has objected that BH Travel did not obtain a court judgment specifically declaring
that the terminations were illegal and thus ineffective. The Tribunal, however, does not consider
such a declaration from a Polish court decisive — or even relevant — for its assessment whether
Claimant, through PPL, had abused rights and thus breached the FET obligation as a matter of
international law.

PPL could have remedied the effects of its illegal terminations by entering into negotiations and
reaching a settlement with BH Travel. However, it refused to do so, because, as a precautionary
measure, BH Travel had commenced court proceedings to try to safeguard under Polish law and
in the Polish courts what PPL had denied. The Tribunal notes again that PPL refused to engage
in good faith settlement discussions.

PPL further aggravated the terminations without compensation by refusing to comply with the
injunction orders given by the Court of Appeal to reinstall BH Travel in its Lease Agreements.
On the contrary, it blocked deliveries to the shops on a formalistic pretext, which some
communication with BH Travel would easily have addressed. Likewise, PPL blocked BH Travel
employees from access to its shops and further implemented a policy to expel BH Travel from
Chopin Airport.

For the Tribunal, the action of the Customs Chamber to seal all of the BH Travel stores, the
intervention of the Governor of Mazovia to order BH Travel to vacate the premises, and the later
unsuccessful appeal to the Polish courts against the Governor’s orders, are all consequences of
PPL’s abusive termination of the Lease Agreements. Indeed, once PPL claimed that BH Travel‘s
Lease Agreements were effectively terminated with immediate effect, the Customs Chamber and
the Governor merely implemented that result. Similarly, for the courts, BH Travel, having had
its leases terminated, was no longer a party entitled to act against the eviction.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that PPL’s actions in terminating the Lease
Agreements — which are attributable to Respondent — constitute a breach of the FET obligation
under Article 3(2) of the Treaty.

Expropriation
Article 5 of the Treaty provides as follows:

(1) Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalized,
expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) in the territory of the other
Contracting Party except for a public purpose in accordance with law on a non-
discriminatory basis and against fair and equitable compensation. Such compensation
[...] shall be made without unreasonable delay, be effectively realizable and freely
transferable.

(2) The Investor affected shall have a right under the law of the Contracting Party making
the expropriation, to review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party,
of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the
principles set out in this paragraph. The Contracting Party making the expropriation
shall make every endeavor to ensure that such review is carried out promptly.

(

a

Where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is incorporated
or constituted under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which
investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure the provisions of
paragraph 1 of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to ensure fair and equitable
compensation in respect of their investment to such investors of the other Contracting
Party who are owners of those shares.’*°

1) The subject of Claimant’s expropriation claim

Claimant’s Position

Claimant submits that PPL’s unlawful actions substantially deprived Claimant of the economic
value, use, and enjoyment of its investment in BH Travel in violation of Article 5 of the Treaty.
Claimant bases its expropriation claim on the unlawful termination of the Lease Agreements,
which it considers to be “valuable concessions”.”*! For Claimant, they were indeed “more than a
simple landlord/tenant relationship”. They are “similar to other concessions for the development
and operation of public purpose infrastructure projects” and were acquired pursuant to single
tender procedure”.””

In response to Respondent’s comments that Claimant still owns its shares in Baltona, Claimant
clarifies that its expropriation claim relates to Claimant’s indirect shareholding in BH Travel, and
not to its shareholding in Baltona.”*

Respondent's Position

Respondent first reiterates its view that “no investment in Poland can be attributed to the
Claimant” for the purposes of the Treaty.”** Respondent also submits that Claimant’s claims of
expropriation cannot be based on purported expropriation of its stock in Baltona, which is still
the property of the Flemingo Group.”

565. Respondent also argues that Article 1(1)(e) of the Treaty, which includes business concessions
conferred by law or under contract as protected investments, is inapplicable here because no
entity from the Flemingo Group ever had concessions of the type covered by the Treaty.”

566. Respondent explains that typically business concessions that “are granted by the State, apply to
activities in an area which is key to its security, and constitute a manifestation of administrative
authority”.”"’ Respondent adds that concessions apply to activities which are “extremely
important to the State” and the entity that is granted a concession conducts business “as a
substitute for the State”.”* Such concessions, Respondent adds, are usually issued through
administrative decisions.”

567. Respondent states that BH Travel did not perform any activities which are of strategic importance
to Poland.”® Respondent also notes that the “procedure for awarding concession is usually
formalised and conducted in an administrative procedure which ends with i

administrative decision by a competent authority body”.”"

568. In this context, Respondent argues that Poland did not issue any concessions to BH Travel and
that the document issued by PPL to BH Travel cannot be a concession under the Treaty because
it was only a permit to operate in the DFZ issued under PPL’s internal rules.” Respondent also
clarifies that decisions issued by the customs office (such as the permit to operate within the DFZ
issued to Claimant) cannot be considered to be concessions either. Those customs permits
“w[ere] secondary and depended on BH Travel winning the tender and agreeing [to] the
conditions of lease and negotiating the wording of the Lease Agreements with PPL”.

 

569. In Respondent’s view the term ‘concession’ in the Treaty should have the same meaning as under
the Polish Business Activity Freedom Act because “the terms used in the BIT should in fact be
supported by the legislation of its parties, and should be construed in accordance with that
legislation”. The Treaty was concluded at a time when only the Business Activity Freedom Act
was in force. Under the Business Activity Freedom Act of 2 July 2004, a concession is “an
individual administrative act (decision) repealing a prohibition to freely take up and pursue
business activity of a given kind and thus allowing the recipient of that act (concessionaire) to
legally perform such business, as a form of rationing of business activity.” Respondent further

765 Rejoinder, para. 15, referring to M. Grabiec, Commentary on Article 1 of the Act on Concessions for Works or
Services, Lexis Nexis 2014, Exhibit RL-27. Respondent submits that under the Act on Concessions for
Construction Works or Services, a concession is “a kind of agreement concluded by and between the grantor
of the concession and the concessionaire”. Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 22, referring to Directive
2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of
procedures for public procurement of construction works contracts, supply contracts and service contracts,
Exhibit RL-29 and Directive 2014/23/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014
on the award of concession. Respondent contends that the use of the term “concession” in the Act on
Concessions for Construction Works or Services is “a transposition from EU law into Polish law”.

      

113

submits that a ‘concession’ for services and a lease are under the Polish Civil Code “completely
separate and different legal institutions”.”

570. Respondent concludes that the Lease Agreements are thus not ‘concessions’ but mere leases.
Respondent concedes that, according to international jurisprudence, a lease agreement can be
subject to expropriation. However, Respondent argues that the Tribunal must establish: (i) “that
the contract was breached”; and (ii) “that the breach is attributable to the State”.””

2) Whether Respondent indirectly expropriated Claimant’s investment
Claimant’s Position

571. Claimant contends that Respondent violated Article 5 of the Treaty through a series of measures
that were incrementally implemented beginning with the termination of the Lease Agreements in
February 2012 and culminating with BH Travel’s eviction from Chopin Airport in August
2012.7 In Claimant’s view, the intended effect of those measures was to shut down BH Travel’s
operations in Chopin Airport and to substantially deprive Claimant of the use and economic value
of its investment in BH Travel.””

572. Claimant observes that, under international law, expropriation may occur directly or indirectly.”
Article 5 of the Treaty covers both direct and indirect expropriation by providing investor
protection against nationalisation and expropriation (direct expropriation) as well as against

measures having effects equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (indirect expropriation).’”

573. Claimant explains that indirect expropriation need not occur through one single event and instead
may arise through a series of measures over time — so-called “creeping expropriation”.””
Moreover, the intent to expropriate is not a necessary element; instead the effect of the measure

on the investor is what matters — as many tribunals have confirmed.”*

574. Claimant further submits that a State indirectly expropriates an investment when it “substantially
deprives” an investor of the benefit of its investment or rights thereto.’ According to Claimant,
in determining whether substantial deprivation has occurred, tribunals have focused on the loss
and enjoyment of the investment,” while other tribunals have analysed the loss of an
investment’s economic value.’

575. Claimant submits that the following me: i byR dent “i drove
BH Travel out of Chopin Airport and ultimately destroyed the Claimant’ 's use and the economic
value of its investments” in BH Travel:””

 

1. On 16 February 2012, PPL arbitrarily and unlawfully terminated the Lease Agreements,
which termination deprived BH Travel and Claimant of the “valuable” concession for
the duty-free shops.

2. On 17 February 2012, the Customs Chamber arbitrarily imposed customs closures on
all of BH Travel’s duty-free shops, which prevented BH Travel from operating the
stores.

3. PPL coerced and harassed BH Travel to leave its remaining two stores at Chopin Airport
by, inter alia, preventing the delivery of goods to the stores, scheduling arbitrary safety
inspections, and cutting off electricity supply.

4, PPL requested the Governor of Mazovia to order BH Travel to vacate its premises in
Chopin Airport within the framework of the Airport Act, on the basis of the planned
modernization of Terminal 1.

5. On 14 August 2012, the Governor of Mazovia evicted BH Travel from its remaining
premises at Chopin Airport without compensation and without affording BH Travel an
effective remedy against the administrative decision.”

Chopin Airport, which were its only operations at that time, to a complete standstill.” In doing

so, PPL indirectly expropriated Claimant’s investment in BH Travel by depriving Claimant “of
the use and economic value of its investment in BH Travel”.”*°

Further, Claimant submits that PPL’s expropriatory acts were intentional and had the express
purpose of enabling PPL to proceed with the planned modernisation project in accordance with
the schedule approved by the EU.”! Claimant submits that many arbitral tribunals have found
that an expropriation occurs where a State’s allegations of contractual breach are “a pretext
designed to conceal a purely expropriatory measure”. Referring to Gemplus v. Mexico as
support, Claimant argues that “Respondent decided to pull the plug on BH Travel’s operations at
Chopin Airport regardless of whether or not the termination was legally justified”.”*?

Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s argument that no expropriation took place because “the
Lease Agreements were concluded by BH Travel long before the acquisition by the Flemingo
Group”,” pointing out that arbitral tribunals have held that it is not necessary for an investor to
lay down “the cornerstone for an investment” to be protected by a bilateral investment treaty.”*

Claimant further takes issue with Respondent’s argument that Claimant was aware of the planned
modernisation of Terminal 1 and should have known that its activities would be suspended

accordingly,’*° submitting that modernisation is often carried out in stages so that a terminal did
187

 

not have to be shut down completely.

Claimant also states that BH Travel and Baltona were not invited to participate in the tender for
the new premises in Terminal 1.’** Consequently, Claimant submits that Respondent’s argument
that “nothing stood in the way for BH Travel to return to the newly established premises [...]

following the modernization of Terminal 1°"? is “unavailing”.’"

Respondent's Position

Respondent avers that no direct or indirect expropriation occurred. According to Respondent, the
termination of the Lease Agreements did not reduce the economic value of Claimant’s purported
investment in Baltona’s stock, nor did it reduce the economic value of BH Travel.”! Moreover,
BH Travel concluded the Lease Agreements long before its acquisition by the Flemingo Group.
The Flemingo Group, Respondent adds, was also aware of the planned modernisation, and

accordingly knew that activities in Chopin Airport would have to be suspended.”

582. Respondent further observes that — to the extent that Claimant considers the shareholding of the
Flemingo Group in Baltona to be the investment — “these shares have not been expropriated at
any time, because the Flemingo Group has not lost ownership or control of these shares to this
day”.” If, however, the Lease Agreements are considered to be the investment, “even the
unlawful termination of agreements will not constitute expropriation in the meaning of the BIT
if this was performed by an entity not acting in the sphere of imperium of the State”.
Respondent submits that the termination of the Lease Agreements was lawful and that, in any
event, the termination of the Lease Agreements cannot be attributed to Respondent. Respondent
explains that the termination was purely a business decision, and there was no interference from
the State. In other words, it did not result from orders, directives, recommendations, or
instructions of the Government of Poland, and therefore the termination cannot result in a breach
of the Treaty.”°

3) Whether Respondent’s alleged indirect expropriation of Claimant’s investment was
unlawful

Claimant’s Position

583. Claimant argues that Respondent’s indirect expropriation of Claimant’s investment was unlawful
because it breached Article 5(1) of the Treaty. Article 5(1), which incorporates customary
international law requirements, provides that an expropriation is legitimate only when it is made:
(i) for a “public purpose”; (ii) “in accordance with the law” (i.e., in accordance with due process);
(iii) on a “non-discriminatory basis”; and (iv) against “fair and equitable compensation” which
“shall be made without unreasonable delay”. Claimant argues that Respondent must satisfy all
four elements for its expropriation to be considered lawful.” According to Claimant, Respondent
accepts these standards for lawful expropriation under the Treaty.”””

584. Claimant contends that Respondent failed to pay fair, equitable, and prompt compensation — on
the contrary, Respondent did not pay any compensation at all. Claimant submits that it is
accordingly unnecessary for the Tribunal to even consider the other requirements of
Article 5(1).”*

585. In any event, Claimant adds that Respondent’s expropriation was not done in “accordance with
law”, which, Claimant submits, means “an obligation to accord due process in accordance with
international law, as opposed to a requirement that Poland comply with its own domestic law”.””

Claimant observes that, if the Contracting Parties to the Treaty intended the term “in accordance

with law” to mean observance of the law of the host State, then they would have drafted the
800

provision to reflect this.
Further, Claimant contends that due process requires compliance with (in addition to the law of
the host State) an international minimum standard of due process. The due process requirement
can be breached in a number of ways, including: (i) failure to provide notice or a fair hearing; (ii)
non-compliance with local law; and (iii) failure to provide a “means for legal redress”.*!
Moreover, Claimant notes that Article 5(2) of the Treaty specifies the contours of the due process
requirement for lawful expropriations and explicitly requires Respondent to accord the investor
the right to “challenge an expropriatory measure before a ‘judicial or other independent
authority’”.°°? Article 5(2) states:

The Investor affected shall have a right under the law of the Contracting Party making the
expropriation, to review, by a judicial or other independent authority of that Party, of his or
its case and of the valuation of his or its investment in accordance with the principles set out
in this paragraph. The Contracting Party making the expropriation shall make every
endeavour to ensure that such review is carried out promptly.*

Claimant also argues that Respondent breached minimum standards of due process when it
denied Claimant an opportunity to be heard before the Governor of Mazovia and then denied
Claimant any recourse against the Governor’s decision approving BH Travel’s eviction from
Chopin Airport.6

Respondent's Position

Respondent maintains that the termination of the Lease Agreements was lawful, stating that “each
action taken by PPL considered separately, as well as all actions considered collectively did not
constitute unlawful and unjust action, which could have led to the expropriation of the investment
and constitute a breach of the BIT”.*®

4) Tribunal’s Analysis

590.

591.

The Tribunal has concluded that the Lease Agreements were investments, under Article 1(1)(c)
of the Treaty, because they granted BH Travel — and thus also indirectly Claimant under the
Treaty — “[r]ights to any performance under contract having a financial value”.

Alternatively, although not argued by Claimant, the Lease Agreements could also be considered
to be investments as “business concessions conferred under contract”, explicitly mentioned in
Article 1(1)(e) of the Treaty. Indeed, the Lease Agreements for operating shops at Chopin
Airport, with the accompanying duty-free status, granted BH Travel exclusive rights which only
public authorities could grant. For the international law qualification of ‘concession’ for Treaty
purposes, it is irrelevant whether or not the Lease Agreements would be qualified as

‘concessions’ under Polish domestic law.

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that Article 5(1) of the Treaty protects the investor not only
against direct but also against indirect expropriations through a series of measures leading to a
deprivation from the benefits of the investment.

The Tribunal disagrees with Respondent’s argument that Claimant’s relevant investment is the
shareholding in Baltona and that the Flemingo Group continues to have full possession of these
Baltona shares. As stated before, the relevant investments, protected by the Treaty in the case at
stake, are the Lease Agreements entered into by BH Travel. The respective and successive
shareholdings are legal investment vehicles which led to the duty-free shop Lease Agreements
as the investment.

In the present case, the Lease Agreements have been annihilated by the acts of PPL, which for
purposes of the Treaty are attributable to Respondent. The acts engaged by PPL include: (i) the
termination of the Lease Agreements, which in the eyes of the Tribunal was a breach of contract;
(ii) the request to the Customs Chamber to seal the premises and the blocking by the authorities
of deliveries and BH Travel staff members; and (iii) the order under Polish public law issued by
the Governor of Mazovia, upon the request of PPL, to evict BH Travel from Chopin Airport.
These consecutive acts, which were upheld by the Governor of Mazovia’s intervention, in
addition to the shutdown of the BH Travel shops, deprived Claimant of the benefit of its (indirect)
investment in the BH Travel duty-free shops at Chopin Airport.

The Tribunal is aware that Respondent argues that the Lease Agreements were acquired before
the Flemingo Group obtained the shares of Baltona, and thus its indirect shareholding in
BH Travel. However, under Article 1(1) of the Treaty, not only investments established, but also
investments acquired are protected. Consequently, the Treaty protects the expropriation of the
Lease Agreements, even though Claimant indirectly acquired the investment after the
commencement of the Lease Agreements, because the acquisition preceded any breach of the
Treaty.

The Tribunal observes that, for the purpose of Article 5(1) of the Treaty, Respondent, through
the actions of PPL, which are attributable to it, has expropriated Claimant’s investment and
deprived Claimant of its benefits without payment of compensation, as Article 5(1) requires.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that Respondent has not only breached its FET obligation under
Article 3(2) of the Treaty but also breached Article 5(1) of the Treaty.

COMPENSATION

The Parties disagree on the question of Claimant’s entitlement to compensation, and further
disagree as to the method of calculation of damages.

Claimant relies on the damage calculations provided in the Expert Report prepared by Mr. Abdul
Sirshar Qureshi of PricewaterhouseCoopers (“First PwC Report”),®” which was later updated
at the time Claimant’s Reply was filed (“Second PwC Report”).*”’ Claimant also relies on the
report of an industry expert, Mr. Abbas Mirza of ICF Limited (“Mirza Report”), which was
submitted with the Second PwC Report.*°

Claimant explains that BH Travel shops at Chopin Airport generated two main categories of
revenue: marketing revenue and sales revenue. Sales revenue is primarily driven by the following
factors: (i) passenger traffic (“PAX”); (ii) spend per passenger (“SPP”); and (iii) inflation. A
third source of revenue would eventually be derived from the sale of its remaining stock and
inventory when the shops close down (“Working Capital”). As to costs, BH Travel shops at
Chopin Airport generated three types of costs: (i) employee costs (“HR costs”); (i) costs of goods
sold (“COGS”); and (iii) rental costs. The percentage of total sales revenue that BH Travel
retained after incurring the direct costs associated with the acquisition of goods sold is known as
the Gross Margin (“Gross Margin”).

Respondent denies that Claimant is entitled to compensation and challenges the assertions that
any damage arose for Claimant. In addition, Respondent challenges Claimant’s method of
calculating its damages and submits that if any compensation should be awarded to Claimant,
only Respondent’s calculation of damage should be taken into account by the Tribunal.
Respondent relies in this regard on the expert report prepared by Deloitte (“Deloitte Report” or
“First Deloitte Report”),“° which was updated and supplemented with calculations at the time
Respondent’s Rejoinder was filed (“Deloitte Report No. 2”)*!°

It is noted that the Parties disagree on the various assumptions adopted by the Parties and Parties”
experts in making their damages calculations. In particular they disagree on:

a. whether, absent breach of the Treaty, the Lease Agreements would have been
terminated or instead suspended and allowed to continue to the end of their original
lease terms (“Base Period”) in the modernised Terminal 1; and

 

b. whether, absent breach of the Treaty, there was any possibility of the Lease Agreements
being renewed after the Base Period for a further period (“Extension Period”).

In view of the differing approaches to the calculations, the Tribunal requested the Parties’ experts
to provide additional calculations of Claimant’s damages under different scenarios, each adopting
different assumptions (“Scenario Calculations”):

a. Scenario A required a calculation of damages based on the assumptions that Terminal 1 was

not modernised, and the Lease Agreements continued to the end of the Base Period, as well
as some increases in the PAX and other operational improvements, if any.

b. Scenario B required a calculation of damages based on the assumptions that the Lease
Agreements were suspended for the duration of the modernisation of Terminal 1, and then
continued to run to the end of their Base Period in the new Terminal 1.

c. Scenario C was free for the Parties and their experts to determine, i.e., the Parties were able
to present any other assumptions and loss calculations.

604. The Parties were requested to submit their Scenario Calculations in the form of an Excel
spreadsheet that was capable of being manipulated. *"’

605. Claimant submitted its Scenario Calculations comprising spreadsheets calculating its damages
under its Scenarios Al, A2, B, and C.*!? Claimant argues that it should be awarded damages as
calculated under its Scenario B Calculation. Respondent submitted its Scenario Calculations A,
B, and C together with a post-hearing supplement to Deloitte Report No. 2, which was later
revised in light of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 4 (“Revised Post-Hearing Supplement
to Deloitte Report No. 2”).*!? The Parties’ arguments are set out below, divided as follows:

* Section A sets out the Parties’ respective views on whether Claimant is entitled to full
compensation, should Respondent be found to be liable on the merits. This section also
provides an overview of the Parties’ respective arguments and counter-arguments as to how
any such compensation should be calculated.

¢ Sections B-E set out, in further detail, the Parties’ arguments on how any such compensation
should be calculated, including the Parties’ positions on damages for actual losses (damnum
emergens) (Section B), damages for loss of profits and loss of opportunity (/ucrum cessans)
(Section C), whether Claimant has substantially changed the amount claimed (Section D),
and the applicable rate of interest (Section E).

A. Standards applicable to compensation and overview of the Parties’ arguments

Claimant’s Position

606. Claimant submits that it is entitled to an award of compensation in an amount sufficient to wipe

expropriation or other violations.*!* Accordingly, Claimant contends that the applicable standard

of compensation in this case is the principle of full reparation under customary international
law.*'> According to Claimant, this principle provides that “reparation must, as far as possible,
wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed”.*"°

608. Claimant submits that the tribunal in AMT v. Zaire held that international law “required” that the
investor be restored to the conditions previously existing as if the illegal events had never
occurred.*!’ Claimant also refers to Azurix v. Argentina, stating that the tribunal in that case had
concluded that the investor’s damage should be assessed “in a hypothetical context where the
State would not have resorted to maneuvers but would have fully respected the provisions of the
treaty and the contract concerned”.*'* Accordingly, Claimant states that the “but for” scenario
“should disregard the consequences of any breaches of the underlying investment treaty, and
assume that the host state would have fully complied with its obligations thereunder”.*"”

609. Claimant states that, in this case, the “but for” scenario must disregard the consequences of
Respondent’s alleged violation of the India-Poland Treaty, including those of a continuous,
creeping, or composite nature. Claimant contends that international law provides that “the
valuation of a right must exclude any diminution in value resulting from the conduct of the host
state”*?! and that the breach is dated “to the first of the acts in the series”.*” In the present dispute,
Claimant contends that Respondent’s violation began on 8 December 2011, with PPL’s failure

to consider any proposal to BH Travel other than the termination of the Lease Agreements by
mutual agreement without compensation, and ended with BH Travel’s eviction from Chopin
Airport on 14 August 2012.5

Claimant asserts that the principle of full reparation encompasses both actual losses incurred
(damnum emergens) and also loss of expected profits (Jucrum cessans), insofar as these losses
are established.* Claimant observes that Respondent does not appear to dispute the legal
principles concerning the right of compensation, or dispute Claimant’s right to pursue damages
for lost profits and for loss of chance.***

First, with regard to actual loss, Claimant submits that it is entitled to recoup the operating losses
incurred by BH Travel in relation to the Chopin Airport shops that remained in operation between
17 February 2012 (the day BH Travel’s stores were sealed by the customs authorities, and the
day after the notices of termination were issued by PPL) and 14 August 2012 (BH Travel’s
eviction from Chopin Airport), reduced by the revenues effectively generated by the shops during
that period (“Operating Losses”). Claimant submits further that it is entitled to recoup the
one-off costs incurred by BH Travel in order to end its Chopin Airport operations and vacate the
premises in 2012, including staff severance, the costs of liquidating fixed assets, and
transportation of inventory costs (“One-Off Termination Costs”).*° Claimant submits that,
according to the calculation of Mr. Qureshi (of PwC), it has incurred, and should be compensated
for, actual losses in the amount of EUR 1,070,370.*”

Second, with regard to loss of profits, Claimant submits that it is “entitled to an award of
compensation in an amount sufficient to recover the net present value of the lost profits that it

Brief and Claimant’s Closing Statement, pp. 64 and 72, Slide 64 and Slide 72. Claimant submits that the “but

for” scenario must wipe out the consequences of any and all of the following even

  

(i) PPL’s alleged failure to negotiate in good faith with BH Travel by not considering any proposal
other than the termination of the BH Travel leases by mutual agreement without compensation as
of the meeting of 8 December 2011; (ii) PPL’s alleged bad faith “fishing expedition” aiming to
identify pretexts to terminate the BH Travel lease agreements without compensation starting on 4
January 2012; (iii) PPL’s alleged bad faith attempt to introduce through the back door in the DFZ
Rules on 10 February 2012 a clause allowing for unilateral termination of the BH Travel leases
without compensation on the basis of the planned modernization work; (iv) PPL’s pretextual
notices of termination of the Lease Agreements dated 16 February 2012; (v) The Warsaw Customs
Chamber’s closure of all BH Travel duty-free shops at Chopin Airport on 17 February 2012,
preventing BH Travel from operating those stores; (vi) PPL’s alleged illegitimate campaign of
coercion and harassment to force BH Travel out of its remaining two stores at Chopin Airport by,
inter alia, preventing the delivery of any goods to BH Travel’s stores from 19 to 21 March 2011,
scheduling arbitrary safety inspections in May 2012, and cutting of the electricity supply, all in
violation of court-ordered injunctions; (vii) PPL’s alleged illegitimate threats to claim contractual
penalties and accordingly draw on the guarantees, which have left BH Travel with no choice but
to surrender most of its premises at Chopin Airport by the end of March 2012; and (viii) The
Governor of Mazovia’s eviction of BH Travel from its remaining premises at Chopin Airport
without compensation and without giving BH Travel an effective remedy against the
administrative decision of the Governor providing the basis for the eviction.

would have earned as of 17 February 2012 from the operations at Chopin Airport”.*** Referring
to legal commentators in support, Claimant states that “lost profits are recoverable if a claimant
can demonstrate that the wrongful conduct has prevented him from realizing financial gain”.
Investment treaty tribunals, Claimant argues, have awarded compensation for loss of profits in
cases where “the profits anticipated were probable or reasonably anticipated”.**°

613. As a “sub-species” of its loss of profits claim, Claimant contends that it is also entitled to
compensation for injury in the form of a loss of opportunity or “loss of chance”. “! Referring to
the award of the tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine, Claimant submits that compensation for loss of
chance “is normally calculated as the hypothetical maximum loss, multiplied by the probability
of the chance coming to fruition”.*” According to Claimant, Respondent damaged Claimant’s
opportunity or chance to have the Lease Agreements renewed, and therefore is liable for the
related losses.*3

614. Mr. Qureshi was instructed by Claimant to calculate the measure of the damages that “would
place Flemingo DutyFree in the financial position it would have been in had Poland not violated
its obligations under the BIT”.8“ To make the calculation, Claimant explains, Mr. Qureshi
considered two different periods:

a. The Base Period, concerning the original lease terms for space in Terminal | and Terminal
2:85 and

b. _ the Extension Period, addressing the damage to BH Travel’s opportunity to renew the Lease
Agreements after their expiration." Claimant explains that the probability that BH Travel
would have the leases renewed was assumed to be 75% (on the basis that the Baltona Group
had prevailed in 75% of the tenders for the lease of duty-free retail shops in which it has
participated as an incumbent in Poland).**”

615. Claimant claims that the “but for” scenario for the Base Period should assume a suspension of
the Terminal 1 Lease Agreements for the duration of the modernisation. In addition, it should be
assumed that BH Travel’s operations in Terminal 2 would have continued from 3 July 2012 to
31 December 2014 (the modernisation period) and through to the end of the stated guaranteed
period of lease.*** This “but for” scenario is reflected in Claimant’s Scenario B calculation (see

paras. 617-620 below).

616. Claimant therefore contends that the “but for” scenario concerning BH Travel’s operations in
Terminal 1 should assume for the Base Period that: (i) BH Travel would have vacated the
Terminal 1 premises on 30 June 2012; (ii) BH Travel would have regained possession of the
same six premises in Terminal 1 on 1 January 2015 after the completion of the modernisation;
and (iii) the length of the terms under BH Travel’s six Terminal 1 Lease Agreements would have
been extended to account for the planned shutdown of the terminal.’ Claimant claims that
Respondent does not dispute these “but for” scenario assumptions” and that Respondent’s

quantum experts have accepted and used “the very same ‘but for’ assumption”.“4!

617. Claimant notes that Mr. Qureshi also submitted the following Scenario Calculations as requested
by the Tribunal:

a. Claimant’s Scenarios Al and A2, “both assume that ‘Terminal 1 was not modernized and
the lease agreements [in both terminals] continued to the end of the base period [with an
Extension Period], assuming also some increase in PAX and operational improvements if
any;’” and

In Claimant’s Scenario A1, it is assumed that BH Travel’s HR costs and COGS for the
BH Travel shops at Chopin Airport would have increased proportionally with future
sales revenues; and

Claimant’s Scenario A2 calculations are based upon the assumption that BH Travel’s
HR costs and COGS would have increased with inflation only, rather than with sales
revenues.“

b. Claimant’s Scenario B “assumes that ‘the lease agreements [for BH Travel’s Terminal 1
shops] were suspended for the duration of the modernization and then continued to run to
the end of their base period in the new Terminal 1’ with an Extension Period”.

c. Claimant’s Scenario C, is an additional calculation of Claimant’s portion of the value of

BH Travel’s lost opportunity to continue its operations for an indefinite period of time.

Claimant submits this is for “illustrative purposes only”.*4

618. Claimant provides that its pre-interest lost profits calculation (i.e., excluding actual loss), under
the different scenarios, amounts to the following sums:

Base Period Extension Period Total

Claimant’s Scenario B 26,462,590 54,100,850 80,563,440

 

 

 

619. Claimant argues that of its Scenario Calculations submitted, the Tribunal should adopt its
Scenario B Calculation, because, in Claimant’s view, this accords with the appropriate “but for”
scenario which disregards the consequences of Respondent's violation of the Treaty. “*°

620. Accordingly, Claimant requests the Tribunal to award compensation in the amount of
EUR 81,633,810 (comprised of lost profits in the Base Period and Extension Period of
EUR 80,563,440 under Claimant’s Scenario B_ calculation, plus actual losses of
EUR 1,070,370).

621. Claimant explains the above amounts were calculated as 80.68% of BH Travel’s actual loss and
loss of profits, on the basis that Claimant held an indirect 80.68% interest in BH Travel on the
date that Claimant views as the appropriate date of valuation, i.e.,17 February 2012." Claimant
maintains that the later changes in its indirect shareholding in BH Travel (on 29 October 2012,
see para. 49 above) should have no bearing on the calculation of Claimant’s damages.”

622. Claimant also requests interest on the above damages. Mr. Qureshi applies an interest rate equal
to a 6-month EURIBOR increased by 2% for the period from the valuation date (which for
Claimant is 17 February 2012) until the date of the payment of the award."

623. In response to Respondent’s assertion that, under the “general concept of liability for damage”,
an element of causation needs to be established between the event and the alleged damage,
Claimant submits that this is not relevant to the issue of quantum.**' Claimant further disputes
the application of an alleged “general concept of liability for damage” on the basis that the current
proceedings are in fact governed by the Treaty, supplemented by international law.**?

of the discounted cash flow method (“DCF method”) is appropriate in the circumstances, and
justifies the assumptions underlying its analysis.“

Claimant requests the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from Respondent's alleged breach of
its obligations under the document production process.*™ Claimant argues that the documents
Respondent refused to submit could have provided more precise data to its calculation of
damages.**

 

At the conclusion of the hearing on 16 October 2015, Claimant submitted that the main points of
contention between the Parties on quantum concern: (i) whether there is a capacity constraint on
PAX of 15 million passengers a year; (ii) whether the DCF method can be used as a standalone
valuation method; and (iii) the applicable discount rate.**°

Respondent's Position

Respondent “challenges the assertion that any damage arose for Claimant”,**’ and further submits
that there is not an “adequate causal relationship between the termination of the Lease
Agreements and BH Travel’s financial loss, referred to by the Claimant as its damage”.***
Respondent also challenges the method of Claimant’s calculations, disputing both the DCF
method used by Claimant to calculate its damages, and the assumptions underlying Claimant’s
calculations.“

First, Respondent disputes that any financial damages had arisen on the part of the Claimant
through the alleged expropriation.” In this regard Respondent claims that an analysis of
Baltona’s operations, its global situation, and the value of BH Travel*' shows that the ending of
the Lease Agreements in fact had a beneficial impact on the value of the Flemingo Group’s
investment in Baltona. Respondent explains its position by stating that “[m]any of the aspects
regarding the history of BH Travel’s cooperation with PPL show that BH Travel’s operations for
Baltona were a business burden, which had a negative influence on its financial standing”.*
Respondent relies on Deloitte Report No. 2 to assert that the “acceptance of rational assumptions
regarding the calculation of the amount of alleged damages will substantially affect its amount”,
concluding that “Flemingo has effectively suffered no loss”.8°

Second, Respondent submits that the “general concept of liability for damages” provides that
three elements are required in order to establish liability, namely: (i) the event, with which the

853 Claimant’s Reply, paras. 422-432; 463-529. According to Claimant, Mr. Qureshi and Mr. Charlton recognised
that the DCF methodology is the appropriate approach in this case. However, as explained by Mr. Charlton,
both sides do not agree about the assumptions. See Hearing Transcript (15 October 2015), 232: 7-17.

provisions of the law oblige the debtor to remedy the damage; (ii) the damage; and (iii) the
appropriate causal relationship. In Respondent’s view, in order to establish the adequate causal
relationship with respect to the specified facts, it should first be established whether the event
constituted a necessary condition for damage (the conditio sine qua non test) and then whether
the damage is a normal consequence of this event.**

Respondent states that the damages sought by Claimant relate to the termination of the Lease
Agreements. However, Respondent asserts that the termination occurred for reasons which were
directly attributable to BH Travel.** In this regard, Respondent emphasises that BH Travel’s
eviction from Chopin Airport was an action taken within the limits of the law, and accordingly
any alleged damages would have arisen only as a result of BH Travel’s own fault (meaning that
Respondent cannot be held liable).'°°

Third, Respondent disputes the variables adopted by Claimant in its calculations, including the
assumptions and data used to calculate the damage in both the Base Period and the Extension
Period.*” Respondent notes that, according to Deloitte, PwC’s calculation is based on
instructions from Claimant that were not sufficiently justified,“® for example, the assumption
that BH Travel’s business at Chopin Airport would have been able to continue after July 2012;°”
and the assumed probability of 75% that Claimant would prevail in the public tender for further
lease periods (according to Respondent this probability should be, at most, 30%).5”

In respect of the DCF method applied by Claimant, Respondent submits that it is not suitable to
be used independently to quantify damage, stating that it is “extremely susceptible to changes in
the underlying assumptions”.*”! Respondent argues that other methods should be used to ensure
proper verification of the damage calculations, including referring to: (i) the value of BH Travel’s
assets; (ii) the relative amounts invested by Flemingo International; (iii) the value of BH Travel’s
shares after the termination of the Lease Agreements; and (iv) the value of BH Travel compared
to a market benchmark.*”

Accordingly, in the event that the Tribunal finds that Claimant has incurred some damages,
Respondent submits that the calculation of damages should take into account the assumptions
and data as provided in the Deloitte Report No. 2.57 In reaching its calculation, Deloitte started
by using the revised DCF model from the Second PwC Report and then made the adjustments to
the financial projections and discount rate that Deloitte felt were necessary.*™ This result was
cross-checked against Deloitte’s loss estimation produced with available market information
concerning Flemingo DutyFree, Baltona, and BH Travel.*” Deloitte’s calculation is that any such

damages for the Base Period for BH Travel as a whole would amount to EUR 5 million.‘”
Deloitte adds that it assessed the amount of additional costs incurred by BH Travel after
17 February 2012 at “EUR 0.2 million”. Deloitte thus concludes that, “[t]aking into account
Claimant’s 80.68% shareholding in BH Travel, we assess the Claimant’s losses as [EUR] 4.2
million”.*””

635. Deloitte does not consider it appropriate to include the Extension Period in its loss estimation,
but submits that if this period is included, any such damage (for BH Travel as a whole) would
amount to EUR 7 million (assuming a probability of 25% for Claimant being able to prevail in
the public tender for further lease periods) or EUR 8 million (if the probability is assumed to be
50%).78

636. Respondent disputes that Claimant has an indirect interest in the alleged loss of 80.68%.
Respondent notes that its experts used that percentage in their calculations, but claims it is
inappropriate. Respondent submits that Claimant’s current interest in BH Travel actually
amounts to 68.34%, as stated by Mr. Ahuja during the hearing.*”

637. R also ited the ing Scenario C: ions as by the Tribunal:

 

a. In Respondent’s Scenario A, it was assumed that Terminal 1 was not modernised and
the Lease Agreements ran until the end of their terms (Base Period). PAX capacity
was assumed to have been limited to 15 million passengers in 2020. The SPP (spend
per passenger) factor for BH Travel for 2012 and thereafter is assumed to continue to
increase in accordance with the projected level of inflation throughout the duration of
the Lease Agreements.**!

b. In Respondent’s Scenario B, it was assumed that the Lease Agreements were
suspended for the duration of the modernisation of Terminal 1, and then continued to
run to the end of their Base Period in the new Terminal |. The SPP factor was assumed
to m. between the Q1 2012 and Q1 2015 period. PAX capacity was assumed to be
limited to 15 million passengers in 2020 (like in Scenario A).

For both Scenarios A and B, it is assumed that Gross Margin would, i.e., at the level
of 46.9%, and a discount rate of 13.7% is applied. All of Respondent's other
assumptions under Scenarios A and B are in line with the Deloitte Report No. 2.5*?

(...) Flemingo DutyFree owns roughly 85% of Flemingo International; 84.8%, to be precise. Flemingo
International owns 100% of Ashdod. Ashdod owns 80%-plus, 80.6% of Baltona, And Baltona owns 100% of

c. In Respondent’s Scenario C, Claimant’s loss is assumed to be equal to the full value
for BH Travel as derived from the Heinemann transaction (EUR 6.2 million).**?

638. Respondent submits that Claimant’s loss under Respondent’s three Scenario Calculations is
provided in the table below. Respondent notes that Deloitte calculated Claimant’s final loss based
on the assumption that Claimant has an 80.68% indirect share in BH Travel.*“* However, as
Respondent views the appropriate percentage as being Claimant’s current indirect interest in
BH Travel of 68.34%, Respondent also includes its own calculation taking only a 68.34%
indirect interest into account:

Respondent’s Scenario C 5.2 million 4.24 million

 

 

 

 

 

639. Respondent challenges the calculations provided by Claimant with respect to Scenarios A, B, and
C. Respondent argues that Claimant, without the Tribunal’s consent, “interfered in the scope of
the Tribunal’s order and has changed its significant assumptions”.**°

640. First, Respondent challenges Claimant’s claim that there are certain “undisputed elements”,
namely assumptions concerning PAX, SPP, Gross Margin, calculation of rent, discount rate,
BH Travel renewal rights for Baltona Classic and Baltona Perfumery shops, and actual losses.**”
Respondent submits that these components remain in dispute.***

  

641. Second, Respondent states that Claimant’s Scenario Calculation spreadsheets were not capable
of manipulation, contrary to the Tribunal’s direction. Respondent notes in this regard that
Claimant has divided the content of its spreadsheets into “disputed” and “undisputed” elements,
with only the “disputed” components being capable of being modified. Respondent also asserts
that Claimant’s input sheet (“front page” tab) and the output sheet (“BH_AII” tab) are limited
and do not allow an extensive analysis of the figures.**°

642. Third, Respondent contends that Claimant adopted assumptions in each of Claimant’s Scenarios
Al, A2, and B that are not in accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions. Respondent thus
submits that Claimant’s calculations are “extremely inflated”.*” In particular, Respondent notes

that Claimant assumed, without authorisation, that a 10-year extension period with a 75%
probability factor is applicable, which violates the Tribunal’s instruction that Scenarios A and B
should only correspond to the Base Period.*°! Respondent further submits that Claimant also
assumed, without authorisation, that: (i) BH Travel would have exercised its right to renew the
Lease Agreements for Perfumery and Classic shops for 36 months;*” (ii) SPP growth would
increase after the year 2011 until it drops in 2015 to the same SPP level in 2011 under
Scenario A;* (iii) SPP would increase similarly under both Scenarios A and B;** (iv) revenues
of Bestseller and Arrival shops would rapidly grow in 2012, and further increase in 2013;8% and
(v) the calculation of rent is in some cases lower than that set out in the Lease Agreements.*”°
643. With respect to Claimant’s request that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from Respondent’s
alleged breach of its obligations under the document production process, Respondent submits
that the absence of the documents requested did not prevent Claimant from calculating its
damages, which increased in its Reply.*”’ In Respondent's view, the increased calculation shows
that the documents were not de facto needed by Claimant.**

B. Damages for actual losses (damnum emergens)
Claimant’s Position

644. As mentioned in the overview above, Claimant submits that it is entitled to an award of
compensation for actual losses incurred in the amount of EUR 1,070,370. Claimant notes that
Respondent does not appear to challenge the recoverability of actual losses under international
law.

645. Claimant states that neither Respondent nor Deloitte have replied to Claimant’s arguments on
actual losses provided in its Reply, which therefore remained unchallenged. Accordingly,
Claimant submits that its arguments on actual losses should be “taken as undisputed between the

parties’ experts”.””"

Respondent’s wrongful measures corresponding to EUR 1,326,690.” Claimant argues that,
since Claimant held an indirect 80.68% interest in BH Travel on 17 February 2012 (which in
Claimant’s view is the appropriate valuation date), Flemingo is entitled to EUR 1,070,373 for
actual losses indirectly incurred.”

647. Claimant states that there are two sub-categories of actual losses incurred by Claimant in the
present case, as identified by Mr. Qureshi:

actual ‘operating loss’ made by BH Travel between 17 February 2012 and 14 August 2012,
when the last shop was vacated which consists of the revenues generated by the shops that
remained in operation during that period and marketing revenues received, reduced by cost
of goods sold and further costs, such as salaries of remaining employees, incurred in the
period’ [Operating Losses]: and

‘one-off termination costs,’ namely ‘staff severance payments,” ‘liquidation of fixed assets,”
and ‘transportation of inventory to other locations’ [One-Off Termination Costs].°°

648. Relying on legal commentators, Claimant argues that “incidental expenses incurred [...] as a
result of the wrongful conduct of a State are recoverable as a matter of principle” and that
“expenses must be considered incidental and be compensated if the [investor’s] decision to
withdraw is causally linked to the [State’s] breach”.°’ Such expenses, Claimant submits, may
include costs incurred by the company related to “winding up its business, relocating its
personnel, payment of lay-off wages, etc”. Additionally, Claimant contends that the “costs of
maintaining a ‘skeleton operation’ of the investor’s local subsidiary for some time following the
breach” are also recoverable.”*

649. With respect to Respondent’s argument that there is “no reason to believe” that the costs of ending
BH travel’s operations at Chopin Airport were “appropriately causally related to the termination
by PPL of the Lease Agreements”, Claimant argues that incidental expenses are recoverable if

‘causally linked to the breach”, without any additional requirement.” In this regard,

they are

damage”.”'° Moreover, Claimant points out that, as a general legal principle, Respondent cannot

invoke the burden of proof as to the amount of compensation for such losses to the extent that it
would defeat the claim for compensation.*!!

650. In addition, Claimant contends that Respondent’s causality argument is not relevant to the issue
of quantum, stating that if Respondent is found liable on the merits, then the causality arguments
“must fail”.°"?

651. Claimant also challenges Respondent’s criticism of the inclusion of Operating Losses in the
category of actual losses, and rejects the suggestion that these essentially concern lost profits.°!
Claimant relies on Mr. Qureshi’s evidence in the Second PwC Report to affirm that Operating
Losses and One-Off Termination Costs are “undoubtedly” actual losses incurred due to the
termination of the Lease Agreements."

652. Claimant also addresses Respondent’s arguments that only “extraordinary” or “undeniably
proven costs” are recoverable as a matter of international law and that the costs incurred bore the
normal consequences related to ending operation at the space.”"* In this regard, Claimant observes
that Respondent has provided no legal authority to support the contention that only “undeniably
prove[n]” and “extraordinary” costs are recoverable under international law."

653. Claimant does concede that BH Travel would have eventually incurred the One-Off Termination
Costs at the end of its original or renewed lease periods at Chopin Airport. However, Claimant
submits, such costs would have been incurred 10 or 20 years later, at the end of the expected
concessions. Accordingly, Claimant argues that it is entitled to recover compensation for
BH Travel’s One-Off Termination Costs as actual losses (noting that the calculation of
Claimant’s future loss of profits has been adjusted to take into account the assumption that such
costs should have been incurred by BH Travel in 2021 or 2031).”"”

Respondent's Position

654. Respondent disputes that the Operating Losses claimed by Claimant are actual losses.
Respondent also disputes that there is a causal relationship between the damage claimed and the
acts of Respondent with respect to BH Travel, (i.e., between the termination of the Lease
Agreements and the end of BH Travel’s operations at Chopin Airport).’'* In addition, Respondent
denies that the costs incurred by BH Travel qualify as damage to Claimant or that they have been
shown to have been “extraordinary” in nature.°!”

profits between 17 February 2012 and 14 July 2012 (i.e., between the date of termination of the

Lease Agreements and the date of the closure of BH Travel’s last shop) in the calculation of
actual losses. According to Respondent, the alleged losses for such period should be treated as
loss of future profits since they are hypothetical in nature.”

656. Respondent also argues that the costs incurred by BH Travel after the termination of its operation
at Chopin Airport were not unexpected or “4 inary”?! ding to Respondent, “the
Claimant should undeniably prove that the costs related to BH Travel ending its operations at
Chopin Airport after the termination of the Lease Agreements were ‘extraordinary’ costs that BH
Travel would never have incurred after the expiry of the guarantee terms and after ending
operations at Chopin Airport”.°”

657. Respondent further contends that the costs concerning the termination of the operation and the
eviction from Chopin Airport were foreseeable, especially considering that “BH Travel was
permanently and persistently not performing the obligations arising from the Lease
Agreements”.”?

658. In addition, Respondent submits that it has not been able to verify the costs allegedly incurred,
namely the employee costs in connection with the ending of BH Travel’s operations. In this
context, Respondent argues that it is difficult to assess whether such individual costs were
justified or whether the amount is reasonable and not grossly overstated.°**

659. Respondent disagrees with Claimant’s statement that the issue of actual losses is undisputed.
Respondent reiterates that the ending of BH Travel’s operations at Chopin Airport bore the
normal consequences related to ending operations and therefore such losses should not be
compensated.”

660. The Parties disagree as to whether Claimant is entitled to compensation for loss of profits in the
Base Period (i.e., the period of the original terms of the Lease Agreements).

Claimant’s Position

661. Claimant states that “lost profits are recoverable if a claimant can demonstrate that the wrongful
conduct has prevented him from realizing financial gain”. Investment treaty tribunals,
Claimant argues, have awarded compensation for loss of profits in cases where “the profits
anticipated were probable or reasonably anticipated”.°”’ Claimant notes, as an example, that the

tribunal in Saar v. Poland upheld a claim for lost profits based upon onward sales.”**

662. Claimant submits that its loss of profits in the Base Period, as calculated by Mr. Qureshi of PwC,
amounts to the following under the various Scenarios:

a. Claimant’s Scenario Al: EUR 18,713,130;
b. Claimant’s Scenario A2: EUR 23,030,750; and
c.  Claimant’s Scenario B: EUR 26,462,590."

663. As already noted (see para. 619 above), Claimant argues that of its Scenario Calculations, the
Tribunal should adopt its Scenario Calculation B as this accords with the appropriate “but for”
scenario which disregards the consequences of Respondent's violation of the Treaty. °°”

664. Set out below are Claimant’s explanations of the reasoning behind each of the variables used in
the calculation of its damages, as prepared by Mr. Qureshi of PwC, including its assumptions
regarding revenue (driven by PAX, SPP, and inflation) and costs (made up of HR costs, COGS,
and rental costs). Also included are Claimant’s explanations of the Gross Margin it adopts as well
as the discount rate used in its DCF calculations.

665. Claimant also submits in its Post-Hearing Brief that Respondent’s quantum experts have agreed
to, not challenged, and in some cases even relied upon some of the following components of the
PwC’s model: (i) the components, sources, and driving factors of BH Travel’s revenues;
(ii) PwC’s projections of BH Travel’s marketing revenues; (iii) ICF’s calculation of the
applicable PAX; (iv) ICF’s calculation of the rate of increase of SPP at Chopin Airport;
(v) Mr. Qureshi’s projections of BH Travel’s operating costs; (vi) the calculation of Flemingo
DutyFree’s indirect interest in BH Travel; (vii) the applicable discount rate; and (viii) the
relevance of 17 February 2012 as the relevant valuation date.°*! According to Claimant, these
elements are considered as “Fixed Elements” for the purposes of its Scenario Calculations.”

 

666. On the other hand, Claimant submits in its Post-Hearing Brief that the following components of
PwC’s model have been challenged by Deloitte: (i) the maximum PAX capacity of Chopin
Airport; (ii) ICF’s calculation of SPP for 2015 at Chopin Airport; and (iii) certain components of
the applicable discount rate. Claimant notes that Mr. Qureshi identified such components as
“Variable Elements” in Claimant’s Scenario Calculations.”

are summarised below.

General assumptions

668. Claimant explains that Mr. Qureshi was instructed to consider the 11 premises leased at Chopin
Airport and distinguish between the original lease terms for space in Terminal | and those for
space in Terminal 2. As already noted, the original lease terms are referred to as the “Base
Period”.24

669. Claimant notes that in the First PwC Report, Mr. Qureshi calculated the lost profits from February
2012 through 30 June 2012, and from January 2015 until the various assumed expiration dates of
the various Lease Agreements, with the last one expiring in June 2020.

670. With respect to the Lease Agreements in Terminal 2, Claimant states that Mr. Qureshi was
instructed to assume that BH Travel would have continued to operate in the five premises leased
at Terminal 2°** and that the original terms and expiration dates would have remained the ones
provided in those Lease Agreements. Claimant justifies this assumption by explaining that
BH Travel’s operations in Terminal 2 should have remained undisturbed or unaffected by the
modernisation of Terminal 1.

671. With respect to the Lease Agreements in Terminal 1, Claimant submits that different assumptions
were applicable to the calculation of damages.°*° Claimant states that PPL planned to shut down
Terminal | from approximately 3 July 2012 to 31 December 2014 due to the modernisation
project at Chopin Airport. Claimant instructed Mr. Qureshi to consider potential scenarios where
“BH Travel would not have been summarily removed from Terminal | on a pretextual basis (and

without any compensation)”.°>”

672. In this regard, Claimant states that Mr. Qureshi was instructed to assume that:

(i) BH Travel would have vacated the Terminal 1 premises on 30 June 2012, (ii) BH Travel
would have regained possession of the same six premises in Terminal 1 on | January 2015
after the completion of the modernization, and (iii) the length of the terms under BH Travel’s
six Terminal 1 leases would have been extended to account for the planned shutdown of the
terminal.*

673. Claimant emphasises that none of the assumptions consider that the modernisation project at

Terminal 1 would have needed to be abandoned.””

674. Claimant justifies these assumptions by stating that one of three scenarios would have occurred
with respect to BH Travel’s Terminal | operations: (i) good faith negotiation would have resulted
in an extension of the period of the Terminal 1 Lease Agreements by a period equal to the period
of disruption; (ii) BH Travel would have been able to secure the same modification of the period
of the Terminal 1 Lease Agreements through application to Polish Courts; or (iii) Article 27 of
the Airport Act would have been used to formally expropriate Claimant’s investment, requiring
that compensation be paid in accordance with the standard set forth in Article 5(1) of the
Treaty.” In Claimant’s view, the first of these scenarios was corroborated by the testimony of
Respondent’s witness Mr. ([PN]."! All three scenarios, Claimant concludes, would have
yielded the same financial consequences, which are reflected in the assumptions used by Mr.
Qureshi.” These assumptions for the Base Period, advocated by Claimant, correspond to
Scenario B.

675. Claimant disputes Respondent’s contention that the valuation should not consider any period
longer than June 2015 and Respondent’s argument that there are “no grounds to assume that BH
Travel’s business activity at Chopin Airport would be continued after [...] July 2012”.°%
A ding to Claimant, Respondent’s position is “: ly flawed, as it would ‘assume
away’ the very breach that the quantum model is designed to compensate, i.e., the termination of
the BH Travel Lease Agreements in breach of the BIT”.

676. Claimant also defends the growth assumptions used by Mr. Qureshi. Claimant denies
Respondent’s assertion that, based on Baltona and BH Travel’s past performance, BH Travel
would not have achieved financial profits in the future.* According to Claimant, the 2014
performance of the Baltona Group confirms Mr. Qureshi’s growth projection.”"° Claimant notes
that in the first quarter of 2015 Baltona achieved even greater results.” Claimant points out that
the expert evidence of Messrs. Qureshi and Mirza, and the testimony of Mr. Jaron, support
Claimant’s assertions regarding Baltona’s potential for growth and strong management.**
According to Claimant, these factors, coupled with Baltona’s successful performance at other
Polish airports, makes it reasonable to assume that BH Travel’s performance would follow the

same positive trajectory."”

677. Claimant states that Mr. Qureshi calculated damages by considering the revenue that BH Travel
shops would have generated if Respondent had not violated its obligation under the Treaty.
Claimant states that Mr. Qureshi was advised to consider two types of revenue: sales revenue and
marketing revenue.

Sales Revenue

678. With respect to sales revenue, Claimant explains that this is mostly generated by the selling of
liquor, tobacco, and perfume.” Claimant further states that sales revenue is driven mainly by
three factors: PAX, SPP, and inflation.”!

PAX

679. Claimant highlights that Mr. Qureshi first relied on the official statistics issued by PPL to estimate
PAX, including PPL’s projection for future PAX growth.°? In the Second PwC Report,
Mr. Qureshi relied upon the PAX forecasts provided by industry expert Mr. Mirza in the Mirza
Report. Mr. Mirza later provided a supplemental calculation dated 6 November 2015 for
Claimant’s various Scenario Calculations.°™ Claimant states that, in contrast, Respondent does
not rely on an industry expert in order to support its positions on PAX and SPP.°*°

680. Claimant challenges Respondent and Deloitte’s claims that the PAX estimation adopted by
Mr. Qureshi does not take into account certain characteristics of Chopin Airport and its growth
pattern when compared to other Polish airports.°*° In addition, Claimant disputes the reliability
of PPL’s PAX statistics adopted by Deloitte to challenge Claimant’s calculation, noting that
Respondent objected to producing PPL’s PAX forecast data in full.°*’ In any event, Claimant
points out, Mr. Qureshi’s estimations were “closer to the actual growth in PAX at Chopin Airport
than those [PAX forecasts] allegedly prepared by PPL”.°*

681. With respect to the PAX numbers provided by Mr. Mirza, Claimant notes that: (i) the PAX levels
from 2010 to 2014 are based upon actual PAX data at Chopin Airport; (ii) the 2015 and 2016
PAX forecasts are based on flights scheduled for that period; and (iii) the long-term forecast
(beyond 2016) is built on the historical relational between domestic international passengers at
Chopin Airport and Polish GDP.°°

682. Following the hearing, Claimant asserts that “[u]ltimately, the parties’ experts in fact agree on all
PAX issues, with the notable exception of the debate as to whether Chopin Airport faces a
looming ‘capacity constraint’ that will cap its passenger flow at 15 million passengers per
annum”."°° Claimant explains that Respondent’s experts have now endorsed Mr. Mirza’s
approach to forecasting PAX at Chopin Airport, including the rate of yearly PAX increases, but
have claimed that Mr. Mirza’s PAX projections should be “capped” at 15 million passengers per
year due to operational and environmental constraints.”®' Claimant claims that: (i) such
constraints are irrelevant or can be overcome; (ii) available data supports Mr. Mirza’s projection;
and (iii) the data Deloitte relied upon does not help Respondents case.” Mr. Mirza opines that,
in Chopin Airport’s current state, it will serve more than 22 million passengers in the long term.°

SPP

683. Turning to SPP, Claimant explains that it is calculated as total sales revenue divided by total
number of passengers. According to Claimant, in order to establish the SPP growth rate,
Mr. Qureshi considered many factors, including “the experience at nearby international airports
outside of Poland, Baltona’s operating experience at other Polish airports, and BH Travel’s
operating experience at Chopin Airport”.°™ Mr. Qureshi’s calculation was updated to use the SPP
growth rate contained in the Mirza Report,” which is the result of “purely a duty-free
analysis”.* Claimant highlights that Respondent’s experts rely on only “a Polish language table”
to support its conclusion concerning SPP.”

684. Claimant contests Respondent’s challenge to Mr. Qureshi’s approach to estimate SPP growth.
Claimant points out that the actual SPP data for 2014, published after Mr. Qureshi’s First PwC
Report, was on average higher than the SPP projected by Mr. Qureshi at that time."

685. Claimant adds that Mr. Mirza has estimated the SPP growth from 2011 to 2031 (for both EU and
Non-EU passengers, and using short-term, mid-term, and long-term stages of SPP growth) and
found an average annual growth rate of | in real terms if Terminal | was modernised
(Scenario B) or Hm. in real terms if it is assumed that Terminal 1 was not modernised

(Scenario A).°® Mr, Mirza explains that the modernisation at Chopin Airport would have created
upside trading opportunities for Baltona.°” Claimant reiterates that Mr. Mirza’s estimation is
adopted by Mr. Qureshi in the Second PwC Report.*”!

686. Claimant submits in its Post-Hearing Brief that, for the most part, “the Respondent’s experts have
accepted Mr. Mirza’s forecast of SPP for use in the quantum analysis”.”” Claimant also notes
that Respondent does not provide comments in relation to SPP in its Statement of Defence or in
its Rejoinder.°”

687. Claimant disputes Deloitte’s assumption in Respondent’s Scenario B Calculation that SPP in
2015 would be the same as in 2011. Relying on Mr. Mirza’s evidence, Claimant argues that the
following factors provide reasons to assume that a solid growth would have continued in 2012:
(i) prior strong SPP growth and the quality of the management of Baltona; (ii) the existence of a
strong spend growth potential in the short term; (iii) the increase in dedicated retail space and a
more optimal layout of the modernised Terminal 1; and (iv) a better-quality environment of the
modernised Terminal 1.’

688. Claimant also challenges Deloitte’s assumption that to “the extent that retail spaces increases
[...] passenger spend would be ‘diluted’ i.e., spread across a wider base, meaning that BH Travel
would not see any incremental benefit from an increase in PAX”. Claimant contends that this
SPP “dilution theory” should have been argued at an earlier stage of the proceedings. In any
event, Claimant adds, Deloitte failed to provide evidence and the methodology supporting its
assumption that SPP would dilute when PAX reaches 15 million.°”*

689. Claimant also disputes Deloitte’s assumption that additional post-modernisation retail space
would have likely been awarded to a different duty-free operator, to the exclusion of BH Travel.
Claimant argues that the evidence available points to the opposite conclusion.”

690. In respect of the non-modernisation scenario (Scenario A), Claimant challenges Deloitte’s
forecast that SPP would have remained at the 2012 level and then increase by inflation only
thereafter. In response, Claimant argues that: (i) PPL was constantly investing on the
improvement of Chopin Airport; (ii) there are no reasons to assume that SPP at BH Travel’s
shops would have stagnated at the level of 2012; and (iii) in 2011 the average SPP at Chopin
Airport was below regional averages and thus had the potential to grow.” Claimant highlights
that Deloitte did not consider “operational improvements” as an SPP driver but only the

modernisation.”

691. In conclusion, concerning SPP, Claimant submits that: (i) Mr. Mirza’s SPP base in 2015 is
reasonable in view of the evidence on record; and (ii) Deloitte’s SPP forecast for Scenario A is
unsubstantiated, whereas the SPP projections provided by Mr. Mirza are credible.”

Inflation

692. The inflation rate used by Mr. Qureshi to calculate sales revenue, Claimant explains, was initially
the International Monetary Fund’s forecasts for inflation in Poland.*’ As Mr. Mirza’s SPP
forecast is based upon the Euro, Mr. Qureshi updated the projection of sale revenues by also
considering inflation rates as forecasted by European institutions, such as the European Central
Bank, and by the Warsaw-based Independent Centre for Economic Studies.*!

Marketing revenue

693. With respect to marketing revenue, Claimant states that this corresponds to the amounts suppliers
pay to BH Travel for marketing campaigns and events. According to Claimant, Mr. Qureshi
calculated marketing revenue based on BH Travel’s historical marketing revenues, and the
marketing revenue achieved by Baltona’s other duty-free shops during the period of 2012 and
2013.9

Working Capital

694. Claimant submits that, absent an extension of the leases at the end of the Base Period, “BH Travel
would have received a stream of revenue consisting of the cash that it would have generated by
selling its unsold stock or inventory” (called Working Capital).**

Costs

695. Claimant points out that Mr. Qureshi calculated the principal operating costs for the BH Travel
shops at Chopin Airport, namely rental costs, HR costs, and COGS. Claimant explains that rental
costs are calculated based on the 11 Lease Agreements with PPL, while HR costs and COGS are
calculated on BH Travel’s actual record of operations.°™

696. Claimant submits that Mr. Qureshi also adjusted the project income streams of BH Travel to
consider “corporate income tax, capital expenditures, and contributions to working capital”.°*

Claimant asserts that “Respondent’s experts confirmed at the hearing [that] Deloitte ‘followed’
“[mlJost of [the PwC] assumptions on costs’ — i.e., including HR Costs and COGS”. Moreover,
“[t]he Respondent’s experts further confirmed that there is no ‘great deal of difference’ between
[PwC and Deloitte in this regard] at all”.°*° Therefore, Claimant submits that PwC’s projection
of HR Costs and COGS “should be treated as agreed between the parties”.°*’

Claimant goes on to describe the HR costs and COGS adopted by Mr. Qureshi under the Scenario
Calculations. Under Claimant’s Scenario B (the modernisation scenario), Mr. Qureshi assumed
that BH Travel would have to hire more personnel and order more goods in the increased retail
space and that these increases will be in proportion to future sales revenues. By contrast, under
Scenario A (the non-modernisation scenario), personnel and quantity of goods would either
increase in line with future sales revenue (Claimant’s Scenario Al) or increase in line with
inflation (Claimant’s Scenario A2).?**

With respect to rental costs, Claimant states that, to its best understanding, “the parties’ experts
are currently in agreement on the issue of projecting the rental costs that BH Travel would have
incurred in any ‘but for’ scenario”, as Deloitte has conceded that Respondent’s mm. average
minimum rent rate increase for the new Terminal | is unsubstantiated.””

Gross Margin

Claimant defines Gross Margin as the difference between total sales revenue and total costs of
goods sold, divided by the total sales revenue, expressed as a percentage. It represents the
percentage of total sales revenue that BH Travel retains after incurring the direct costs associated
with acquisition of goods sold.””

Claimant states that Mr. Qureshi estimated that the Gross Margin of the various BH Travel shops
was a weighted overall average of 46.8% in 2010. Mr. Qureshi assumed that BH Travel’s Gross
Margin would have improved by 1% in 2012 and 2013 and then by 0.5% from 2014 onwards,
until it reached an overall average Gross Margin of 54.4% by 2031.°! Claimant submits that
Mr. Qureshi’s Gross Margin assumptions are “reasonable” and supported by BH Travel’s
historical Gross Margin improvements as well as Baltona’s financial results.”

Claimant challenges Deloitte’s approach, which assumes a constant Gross Margin at the level
recorded by BH Travel in 2011 (46.9%). Claimant submits that Deloitte’s steady Gross Margin

for BH Travel’s “but for” operations at Chopin Airport from 2011 to 2031 is too conservative,

is not supported by evidence, and ignores Baltona’s performance as a valuable indicator.”
Valuation date and Claimant's indirect interest in BH Travel

Claimant submits that the valuation date assumed by Mr. Qureshi is 17 February 2012 because
PPL’s notices of termination were issued on 16 February 2012 and customs authorities sealed
BH Travel’s shops on 17 February 2012. Claimant clarifies that Mr. Qureshi was instructed to
consider post-valuation date data and events to project BH Travel’s income stream and to ignore
post-breach changes in the ownership structure of Claimant’s investment.

Claimant does not share Respondent’s and Deloitte’s view that the calculation of damage should
not consider post-valuation date data and events.”* Claimant submits that this approach is not
supported by previous investment arbitral tribunals.”°° Claimant argues instead that the use of
such data can help with a more precise assessment of the investment.” Claimant also cites legal
commentary to support its stance that if “good evidence of performance subsequent to the injury
event does exist, a court (or an arbitral tribunal) may reasonably conclude that the actual business
track record is useful information to be taken into account”.

Claimant asserts that, contrary to Respondent’s contentions, changes to Claimant’s indirect
interest in BH Travel subsequent to the valuation date “have no bearing upon the calculation of
Claimant's losses as on that time”.°”” According to Claimant, “damages are to be assessed as on
the date of valuation and ‘changes to the investment subsequent to the valuation date are
ignored’”.'” Accordingly, Claimant is of the view that damages should be calculated on the
basis of Claimant’s 80.68% indirect shareholding in BH Travel as at 17 February 2016, and
Claimant’s later decreased indirect interest (from 29 October 2016 onwards) should be
disregarded.

 

Finally, Claimant points out that the Second PwC Report considers “updated information,
projections and calculations concerning cost of equity, inflation rates, and PAX levels at Chopin
Airport”.!! Also, Claimant explains that the Mirza Report contemplates “actual PAX and SPP
data for the period from 2012 through to December 2014”.!°

time value of money and is calculated by reference to the risk-free investment alternatives in the
capital markets. Claimant explains that Mr. Qureshi built the discount rate containing the
following three components: (i) the cost of equity; (ii) the yield on 10-year Polish government
bonds; and (iii) a “Beta coefficient”. Mr. Qureshi’s discount rate is thus 8.18% (calculated taking
post-valuation date data into account).!°°>

 

 

708. Claimant states that post-valuation date data and events should be used for purposes of calculating
its damages, including the discount rate.'° Claimant contends that its position is in accordance
with international case law and scholarly writings.'°”* Claimant states that Deloitte adopts the
opposite approach and fails to provide reasons and legal authorities in support of its position.'°°

709. Claimant nevertheless notes that Mr. Qureshi has provided an alternative assessment of the
damages based on the discount rate considering only the data and events as known on the
valuation date (which, in Claimant’s view, is 17 February 2012).!°” The discount rate in this
calculation is 10.96%,'°

710. Claimant submits in its Post-Hearing Brief that both Parties adopt the same overall approach for
discount rate,'°” and the dispute concerning discount rate is thus limited to three issues: (i) the
date of calculation of the discount rate (using post-valuation date data and events); (ii) the
necessity of an additional country risk premium; and (iii) the relevance of any size premium.'°!°

 

711. With regard to whether to apply an additional country risk premium, Claimant submits that it is
wrong to increase the discount rate with an additional 1.1% country risk premium as applied by
Deloitte.'"'! Claimant contends that, as explained by Mr. Qureshi, the rates of Polish government
bonds adopted by PwC already reflect Polish country risk.'°!? Furthermore, Claimant claims that
Deloitte failed to substantiate the data upon which it relied in order to calculate the 1.1% country

risk premium,'°? and that the country risk premium approach “has important methodological

712. Finally, Claimant argues that no “size premium” should be added to the discount rate. It claims
that Deloitte is wrong in increasing the discount rate by 2% on the basis that BH Travel is a small
business and therefore has risky cash flows.'°'* According to Claimant, a premium should not be

added, primarily because BH Travel is part of a larger group, i.e., the Baltona Group and the

Flemingo Group.'°'®
Respondent's Position

713. As noted above, Respondent disputes the existence of damage to Claimant. However, in case the
Tribunal finds that Claimant has lost profits under the Base Period, Respondent submits that it
should only take account of Respondent’s calculation of loss.'°'? Pursuant to Deloitte Report
No. 2, such damages for BH Travel would amount to EUR 5 million.''* This amount would need
to be adjusted to account for the relevant indirect interest held by Claimant in BH Travel.
Respondent submits that Claimant’s current indirect interest in BH Travel, 60.34%, is relevant
for the calculation of damages, and not Claimant’s indirect interest at the time the Lease
Agreements were cancelled.

714. Respondent explains that it did not present its own calculation in the Statement of Defence
because “it was not obliged to do so”. In addition, Respondent contends that “it is not its role to
present calculations of alleged damage, which, after all, it is challenging”.'°”” In Respondent’s
view, the burden of proving the amount of damage lies with Claimant.'°°

715. Deloitte submits that the historical financial results of BH Travel'! do not support the
assumption applied by Mr. Qureshi, arguing that the forecast results will be significantly better
than the historical data. In this regard, the Deloitte Report notes that the justification provided in
the First PwC Report for the significant growth is in fact the acquisition by Flemingo Group.”

Respondent submits that after the acquisition, BH Travel continued to be poorly managed, and
further submits that it had limited opportunities to improve its margins on core activities.'°
Accordingly, Respondent concludes that it is unreasonable to expect a significant improvement
in the financial standing of the company in the long-term.'°**

716. Respondent further disagrees with Claimant’s assumption that BH Travel would have continued
to operate after completion of the modernisation of Terminal 1 under the same conditions
provided in the Lease Agreements. Respondent claims that the assumption is “illogical from the
outset and unrelated to the reality of business”.'°*

717. First, Respondent points to the fact that the retail space leased by BH Travel was liquidated as a
consequence of the modernisation works. Accordingly, the Lease Agreements in Terminal 1
could not have been extended, and instead the lease of the new commercial space would have
been the subject of a new public tender. In this regard, Respondent recalls that BH Travel initiated
numerous court proceedings against PPL and suggests that, in this context, BH Travel may not
have been invited to be part of a new tender.'”°

718. Even if BH Travel might have participated in a public tender for the new commercial space and
won it, Respondent stresses that it is wrong to assume that the same terms and conditions of the
Lease Agreements would have been applied to the new term. Respondent explains that, after the
modernisation of Terminal 1, the premises became completely different, modernised, and
therefore better.'°” As a consequence, the new retail and services areas at Terminal 1 have higher
rates of rent.'°*

719. Respondent also claims that the Lease Agreements were not to be extended automatically over
the guaranteed period, unless strict conditions were satisfied, as provided in the Lease
Agreements.’ Respondent states that BH Travel failed to meet the requirements provided in

dated 13 March 2008, Exhibit C-20; Lease Agreement between PPL and BH Travel (Classic) dated 13 March
2008, Exhibit C-21. Section 7 of these Lease Agreements provides:

The Parties agree that, upon the expiration of the period described in section 3, subject to
implementation by the Lessee of the provisions of § 5 sections 6 and 10, and not being in arrears
with the payments of the minimum leasing fee for a period longer than three payment periods during
the first guaranteed period covering 84 months from the date of signing the first
“Delivery/Acceptance Protocol’, guaranteed period covering 84 months shall be extended for further
guaranteed period of 36 months, calculating from the end of the guaranteed period covering 84
months. § 5 section 6 The Lessee undertakes to perform adaptation works in the premises in respect
of its business operations for marketing purposes or in order to refresh and/or adapt its offer to
market requirements at least once every three years during the term of the Agreement. § 5 section

Section 7(3) of the Lease Agreements concerning “inter alia the performance of adaption works
at the premises for marketing purposes and in order to refresh or adapt its offering to market
requirements at least once every three years”.'°°°

Respondent argues that BH Travel failed to conduct the adaption works within the deadline and
Claimant failed to present any evidence on this point.'"! Therefore, in Respondent's view, “it
cannot be assumed that the premise causing the extension of the “guaranteed period’ would have
taken place”.'"* Accordingly, Respondent disagrees with Claimant's contention that the Parties’
experts agreed that BH Travel would have exercised 36-month renewal rights for Baltona Classic
and Baltona Perfumery.'°

Revenue

R disputes the pti ing Claimant's esti growth in respect of both

SPP and PAX. The Deloitte Report submits that Mr. Qureshi’s assumptions are not supported by
sufficient analysis of factors influencing passenger spending.

SPP

The Deloitte Report contests the use of the GDP of Poland as a key driver for the SPP factor, on
the basis that only a part of the relevant consumers are Polish citizens.'°*

 

The Deloitte Report also submits that Mr. Qureshi failed to explain how the comparators adopted
in his calculation represent a valid reference to Chopin Airport. In response, the Deloitte Report
analysed the records of historical SPP changes indicated by Mr. Qureshi’ and concluded that
they have high variability. For this reason, the Deloitte Report submits that the validity of any

comparison with other airports is undermined.!°*°

For the modernisation scenario (Scenario B), Respondent emphasises that its experts have
retained the assumption for 2015 that any “[SPP] growth post-modernisation will be limited, and
simultaneously disagreed with Claimant’s hypothesis that SPP would increase by over mi.
immediately following post-modernization”. Respondent also notes that for the period beyond
2015, its experts have assumed that “growth in SPP will be the same as forecast in the Mirza
Report”.'°*” In the absence of modernisation (Scenario A), Deloitte argues that the potential for
BH Travel’s SPP to grow was negligible and was thus assumed to grow from its 2012 level in

PAX

With regard to the potential further growth in PAX, Deloitte notes that the data applied by
Mr. Qureshi concern forecast growth related to all Polish airports, and not specifically Chopin
Airport. According to Deloitte, Chopin Airport is already the most developed and utilised airport
in Poland,'®” and therefore Mr. Qureshi should have explained the reasons why long-term PAX
growth at Chopin Airport is comparable to other Polish airports.

Furthermore, Deloitte submits historical statistical data showing that the share of Chopin Airport
PAX decreased considerably between the 2009 and 2014 estimates.'” Deloitte thus concludes
that Mr. Qureshi failed to conduct a thorough analysis of PAX assumptions.'!

Furthermore, Respondent challenges Claimant’s updates to the PAX index and upholds PPL’s

estimations.'” Specifically, Respondent opposes the assumptions and the calculation of PAX
provided in the Mirza Report (which is adopted by Claimant) “as being unreliable, unproven by

any evidence and therefore incredible”.!°

According to Respondent, the Mirza Report assumes that the number of passengers at Chopin
Airport will increase by approximately 10.8 million from 2016 to 2031, finally reaching
22.9 million passengers by 2031.'“* Respondent submits that these assumptions are “too
optimistic and unrealistic”, since Chopin Airport is the most developed airport in Poland and has
lower than average potential for future growth in future PAX.'*

Moreover, Respondent argues that the evidence relied upon by the Mirza Report is not reflected
in other sources. Respondent cites the CDM Report, which estimates the PAX for Chopin Airport
as follows: “2015 — 10,405,465, 2025 — 15,502,171, 2035 — 18,865,788”;'™° as well as PPL’s
estimations, which assumed that in 2015, Chopin Airport will accept 10,973,911 passengers. !°*”
Both of these estimations, Respondent argues, are in line with the number of passengers at Chopin
Airport during the first half of 2015.'°* Respondent also cites PPL’s Comprehensive Analysis of
Capacity, which estimates that Chopin Airport will achieve its peak capacity in number of

passengers (15 million) by 2020 and will not increase after that.'°” In light of these and other
sources, Respondent submits that both Claimant’s and Mr. Qureshi’s estimation of 22 million
passengers in 2020 are incorrect.'°°

730. Respondent also states that the Comprehensive Analysis of Capacity supports PPL’s estimations
concerning the PAX index, and discredits the Mirza Report. Respondent explains that, in order
to increase the capacity of Chopin Airport after 2020, major structural enlargements (which
would be limited due to its surroundings and location) or even the construction of a new airport
around Warsaw, would be required. In either case, Respondent claims that it is not realistically
possible to increase passenger throughput at Chopin Airport after 2020 and therefore to achieve
the PAX growth estimated by Claimant.'°!

731. Deloitte further submits that, even if the 15 million capacity constraint were overcome, the
increased PAX would require increased retail space, which would mean that SPP would be
diluted (i.e., spread across a wider base).'°?

732. Respondent therefore maintains that the differences between the Parties’ experts on PAX
projections are significant. Respondent supports Deloitte’s approach, according to which, from
2020 onwards, PAX would remain constant at 15 million passengers. !°?

Costs

733. Respondent disputes Claimant’s assertion that there is an agreement on the calculation of rental
charges; however, these relate to the Extension Period and are accordingly described later in this
Award (see paras. 780-783 below).

 

734. Respondent notes that Mr. Qureshi has predicted an increase of the trade margin from 47.8% in
2010 to 48.2% in 2015 and 51.2% in 2020.' According to Respondent, Mr. Qureshi’s
estimation is an “overly optimistic forecast”. In Respondent’s view, there is insufficient evidence
for the claimed effectiveness of Claimant’s busin rategy that would justify the forecasted
profit margin. Respondent claims that its experts provide a more reasonable approach, namely
that the Gross Margin would remain at 46.9% in line with the last observed data point.'°**

 

 

735. The Deloitte Report also notes that Mr. Qureshi’s forecast of BH Travel’s Gross Margin assumes
a stable and continuous growth to levels recorded by two top performers in the duty-free market.
According to Deloitte, Mr. Qureshi does not explain why these two companies are the most
appropriate comparators. In addition, Deloitte submits that Mr. Qureshi does not seem to consider

that the Gross Margin target may differ among different duty-free shops.'°*

Discount rate

Respondent challenges the discount rate adopted by Claimant to calculate the damages. Deloitte
submits that the rate applied by Mr. Qureshi is considerably lower compared to the rates applied
by stock market analysts for comparable companies.'°*’

Deloitte notes that Mr. Qureshi found the discount rate by estimating BH Travel’s costs of equity
at 6.6%. According to Deloitte, this number is underestimated. Deloitte compares BH Travel’s
costs of equity with that of Dufry AG, the leader in the duty-free industry. It states that Dufry
AG’s costs of equity remain within the range of 9.8%-11.7%.'°*

Deloitte furthermore explains that Dufry AG is a company with a higher scale of operations and
profitability than BH Travel and therefore BH Travel’s costs of equity should be necessarily
higher than those of Dufry AG. For Deloitte, this confirms the conclusion that the discount rate
applied by Mr. Qureshi is significantly underestimated.!°°

Respondent does not agree that country risk is fully reflected in the Polish bond interest adopted
by Mr. Qureshi. Respondent claims that the discount rate should include a country risk premium
of 1.1%. In addition, Respondent submits that the discount rate should include a size premium of
2% based on BH Travel’s smaller size and thus higher risk.'°°

In conclusion, Respondent claims that a discount rate of 13.7% should apply.'"

Valuation date

The Deloitte Report notes that Mr. Qureshi failed to take into account the change of the ownership
structure that occurred on 29 October 2012 (see para. 108 above).'"* Respondent claims that, as
this change has a direct impact on Claimant’s indirect stake in Baltona (and thus BH Travel), the
calculation of the amount of the loss should reflect the reduction in ownership from 80.68% to
68.34%, 10%

Respondent also criticises the period of time that Claimant took into account to assess the damage
in the form of /ucrum cessans. Respondent submits that any calculation should only consider the
period up to June 2015, i.e., the end of the Lease Agreements. According to Respondent, the
evidence submitted in these proceedings shows that the Flemingo Group knew about the
upcoming modernisation of Terminal | and considered the termination of the Lease Agreements

that would result therefrom.'°“ Since it knew about the planned modernisation, Flemingo Group
“must have taken [this] fact into consideration in its financial risk and its potential influence on
the final estimation of the value of investment in Baltona’s shares.'%° Thus, Respondent
concludes that there are no sufficient grounds to assert and assume that Claimant would have
continued its activities at Chopin Airport after June 2015.'°°

743. Additionally, Deloitte criticised the calculation of a discount rate on a date later than the valuation
date, as was done by Mr. Qureshi. According to Deloitte, the correct approach is to calculate the
discount rate on the valuation date and use pre-judgment interest to reflect the time value of
money up to the date of the award.'°”

2) Loss of profits for the Extension Period

744. The Parties disagree as to whether Claimant is entitled to compensation for loss of profits in the
Extension Period (i.e., the period after the original terms of the Lease Agreements (Base Period)
has come to an end).

Claimant’s Position

745. Claimant contends that it is entitled to compensation for injury in the form of a loss of opportunity
or “loss of chance”, as a “sub-species” of its loss of profits claim. '°

746. Claimant states that the compensation for lost profits for the Extension Period concerns its loss
of opportunity, which “is normally calculated as the hypothetical maximum loss, multiplied by
the probability of the chance coming to fruition”.'° According to Claimant, Respondent

damaged Claimant’s opportunity or chance to have the Lease Agreements renewed, and therefore
1070

 

is liable for the related losses.

747. Claimant submits that its loss of profits in the Extension Period, as calculated by Mr. Qureshi of
PwC, amounts to the following under the various Scenarios:

a. Claimant’s Scenario Al: EUR 43,405,290;
b. Claimant’s Scenario A2: EUR 57,161,450; and

c. Claimant's Scenario B: EUR 54,100,850.!°7'

748. Claimant explains that the calculation for the loss of profits under the Extension Period used the
same inputs and assumptions as for the Base Period.'°”

The probability of having the lease agreements renewed

749. In order to claim the alleged opportunity lost, Claimant relies on the assumption that “an
incumbent duty-free concessionaire is in the strongest position to win the renewal tender after
the expiration of the concession”.'" According to Claimant, Mr. Qureshi assumed that Baltona’s
opportunity to have the leases renewed is a 75% probability. Claimant explains that the 75%
probability corresponds to the percentage of tenders in which Baltona, the incumbent, has
prevailed over Aelia — Baltona’s main and only competitor in the Polish duty-free market, when
Baltona was tendering as an incumbent.'°"*

750. Claimant points out that Mr. Mirza supports the assumption that an incumbent operator has
increased chances to have lease agreements renewed. Specifically, Mr. Mirza submits that an
incumbent operator has: (i) less of a learning curve; (ii) built up knowledge of the business and
customers; and (iii) a strong working relationship with the airport management.'°>

751. Furthermore, Mr. Mirza provides that “it is evident that duty-free operators have a strong chance
of either being awarded extensions on their existing contracts or being reselected [...] in
situations when contracts are up for a competitive tender”.'°" Claimant points to a publicly
available study prepared by Shipley, which states that the “average incumbent win rates are
70-90% across all industries”.'°””

752. Claimant submits that Mr. Mirza’s analysis is consistent with previous Baltona tendering
experience. Claimant states that Baltona has won three of the six tenders for Airport duty-free
retail in Poland as an incumbent and in two of the three occasions where Baltona lost, the winner
was another incumbent duty-free operator. '0*

753. According to Claimant, the evidence confirms that BH Travel had significantly higher chances
of remaining in the premises after the expiry of the Base Period.'”” For this reason, Claimant
contends that the 75% probability adopted by Mr. Qureshi is reasonable. '"°°

754. Claimant challenges Respondent’s concerns with the difficulties of predicting whether BH Travel
would win the tender and whether it would necessarily generate profits during the Extension

Period. In response to Respondent’s first concern, Claimant submits that the 75% probability
factor is used to reflect the risk that BH Travel would not win the renewal tenders.'°! With
respect to Respondent’s second concern, Claimant answers that investment treaty tribunals and
commentators support the assertion that future profits need not to be “guaranteed” in order to
entitle a claimant to compensation, as long as they are “probable or reasonably anticipated”!
or “more probable than not”.'*3 Claimant further submits that investment treaty tribunals have
had no hesitation in awarding damages for loss of opportunity or “loss of chance”.'™*

755. Claimant also the evidence i by Respondent in its Rejoinder (letters from
companies managing airports in Poland) to support Respondent’s contention that “there is no
special business practice favouring existing lessees of commercial space at airports”.'°*> Claimant
submits that the letters were produced specifically for these proceedings at the request of the
Attorney General of the Polish State Treasury and do not reflect actual business records.'°*° Thus,
they should be given no evidentiary weight.'°*’ In addition, Claimant states that Respondent has
actually conceded that BH Travel had an incumbency advantage.'°**

756. Claimant also disputes Respondent’s quantum experts’ assertion that the “bad blood” between
Baltona/BH Travel and PPL would have lessened the probability for renewal.'°” According to
Claimant, no “bad blood” existed between BH Travel and PPL before the 8 December 2011
meeting; at that time PPL was “fully satisfied” with BH Travel. Claimant states that any “bad
blood” after that date was due to Respondent’s violations of its obligations. Consequently
Claimant contends that Respondent’s “but for” scenario “fails to wipe out the ‘bad blood’
between BH Travel and PPL”.'” In Claimant’s view, the calculation of the loss of opportunity
should be based upon “the same situation that existed between BH Travel and PPL before the
8 December 2011 meeting”.!!

Respondent.’

assumption that BH Travel had a good chance of having the Lease Agreements renewed.'°°

The increase of rental fees

759. Claimant challenges Respondent’s assertion concerning the increase of nearly mm. in rental
fees in the Extension Period after the conclusion of the modernisation at Terminal 1. Claimant
also asserts that in Deloitte Report No. 2, Respondent’s arguments concerning the increase in
rental fees was abandoned.'"°

760. Claimant agrees with Respondent that “the new lease agreements could potentially provide for
increased rents”.'°?’ However, it submits that Mr. Qureshi’s calculation has already captured such
increases by considering the volume of BH Travel’s sales and inflation (the variables on which
rental is dependent).'°*

761. Claimant notes that the estimation provided by the Deloitte Report is based on information
provided by PPL.'°” In this regard, Claimant argues that the alleged rental increase is not
grounded on reliable evidence, and points out that Respondent has continuously resisted the
disclosure of PPL’s evidence concerning rental fees. |'°°

 

762. Claimant recalls that Respondent has claimed that this information constitutes trade secrets and
that it is immaterial to the dispute.'"’' After the Tribunal ordered Respondent to produce this
information, Claimant notes, Respondent produced only a letter from PPL that stated that “the
average minimum rate for retailing and catering at Terminal 1 increased by approximately
HB’, whereby the average minimum rate for retailing increased by about [f%”.""? Claimant
concludes that “[t]he record and chain of correspondences thus confirms that Deloitte must have

The length of the Extension Period

764. Claimant asserts that Mr. Qureshi was instructed to assume a 10-year extension for the Lease
Agreements.!!° Claimant observes that the 10-year period “corresponds to the same effective

the most significant of all of the 11 leases”.!"""

agreements” and not the ten years defended by Claimant.'!°* Claimant disputes the reliability and

airports in Poland (see para. 755 above).'!”

766. Claimant submits that the evidence “confirms that the lease agreements between PPL and Aelia
for the premises in modernised Terminal 1 provide for a 10-year guaranteed period of lease”.'!"°
Thus, Claimant concludes that Mr. Qureshi’s 10-year guaranteed duration of the Extension
Period is credible, and remains unchallenged.!!!!

767. Finally, Claimant notes that Mr. Qureshi prepared a “Scenario C” calculation “for illustrative
purposes only”,!'? which calculated Claimant’s portion of the value of BH Travel’s lost
opportunity to continue its operations for an indefinite period of time. The Scenario C calculation
provides that damages would amount to EUR 177,261,000. Claimant thus concludes that

Mr. Qureshi’s other calculations “are reasonable, not to say conservative”.!!'5

Respondent's Position

Respondent challenges the claim that Claimant is entitled to damages concerning the lost profits
during the Extension Period. Respondent also asserts that the assumptions used by Claimant
concerning the Extension Period are not supported by the facts and evidence presented.!''4

In the event that the Tribunal finds that Respondent is liable for damages for loss of profits in
respect of the Extension Period, Respondent submits Deloitte’s calculation of these damages
should be accepted by the Tribunal. In making its calculation, Deloitte assumes two different
probability factors concerning BH Travel’s chances of having the leases renewed, either 25% or
50%. Accordingly, Deloitte states that if the Extension Period is included in the calculation for
loss of profits, damage for BH Travel (as a whole) for this period would amount to EUR 7 million
(assuming a probability of 25%) or EUR 8 million (if the probability is assumed to be 50%).'!°

Respondent notes that Claimant also submits calculation of its damages under its own Scenario C.
Respondent argues in this regard that Claimant’s assumption under Scenario C concerning the
probability factor of 75% and the continuation of the Lease Agreements for an indefinite period

is “an extreme exaggeration and translates into an even more inflated loss estimate”.'!!®

The probability of having the Lease Agreements renewed

Respondent disputes the assumptions relied on by Mr. Qureshi that the Lease Agreements would
be prolonged or renewed for a new period after their expiration. According to Respondent,
BH Travel’s chances of winning a new tender were negligible.'!!” Deloitte’s estimation provides
that BH Travel’s probability of winning should have been 50%, or, if considering the
participation of its competitors, as low as 30%.'''*

Respondent emphasises that PPL is subject to public tender procedures and therefore a new lease
would require the announcement of a new tender.''!? Respondent further justifies its conclusion
that the probability of BH Travel winning a new tender in the modernised Terminal 1 was
relatively low by noting that: (i) BH Travel was generating losses and therefore it was not clear
whether it would be able to present a competitive offer relative to its main competitors, namely
HDS and Keraniss;!"° (ii) it is not certain whether BH Travel would have been able to meet the
requirement of “coherent development of the airport space” that was adopted after the
modernisation of Terminal 1;'!?! and (iii) Baltona won only three out of six tenders which it
entered, i.e., 50%. Respondent thus concludes that Claimant’s assumption of a 75% probability
of renewing the lease is unsupported by the facts.'' Furthermore, Respondent notes that
Mr. Qureshi conceded that he was instructed to apply the 75% rate and he does not have the

expertise to estimate the appropriate figure.'!”*

773. Respondent also argues that Claimant ignores the fact that the past interactions between
BH Travel and PPL reduce the probability of the extension of the Lease Agreements. '!4

774. R dent also add: Claimant’s ption that i i have increased

 

chances to succeed in tenders. In this regard, Respondent points out that three incumbent
companies at Chopin Airport could take part in the tender (HDS, Keraniss, and BH Travel).!!>
In the view of such circumstances, BH Travel’s financial difficulties,''?° and the lack of similar
difficulties on the part of BH Travel’s competitors, Respondent submits that the chances of
BH Travel winning the tender would have been no more than 30%.'?7

775. In any event, Respondent concludes that the assumption that existing tenants have increased
opportunities, as suggested in the Mirza Report,'!”* is groundless.

776. Respondent disputes Claimant’s assertion that Poland has failed to provide any data disproving
the assumption that an incumbent operator is in a better position to win a new tender after the
expiration of the concession. According to Respondent, “it is the Claimant who is responsible for
proving circumstances from which it is arguing consequences in this case.” In Respondent’s
view, Claimant has failed to demonstrate that the Lease Agreements would have been extended
when BH Travel was breaching its contractual obligations. !'°

777. Respondent submits that BH Travel’s chances of winning the tender need to be evaluated using
objective criteria. In this regard, Respondent points to criteria applied by companies managing

airports to extend lease agreements with existing lessees. These criteria include “an economic
analysis, the level of revenue per Im? of leased space, the frequency of late payments, the
breaches of the provisions of the agreement by the lessee, and the breach of the generally
applicable provisions of the law by the lessee”.''° The criteria to extend a lease in another airport,
Respondent notes, includes the analysis of whether “a lease agreement foresees this option and
if the extension is viable for a company's business activities”.!'*!

778. Respondent also submits that the theory that an incumbent holds a more favourable position is
not borne out in practice. In one Polish airport, Wroclaw Airport, Respondent observes, “new
tenders led to the selection of lessees, [...] some of whom were new entities to [Wroclaw Airport],

but which have sound experience in their sector”.''* In the case of that airport, only four of the

nine incumbents could continue in the airport’s new terminal.''* In another example, the airport
in Lodz did not renew and did not add an annex to lease agreements with previous tenants from
its old terminal.''™*

779. Respondent further cites the findings of Deloitte Report No. 2, which refer to “an additional set
of worldwide cases where incumbents were not successful in securing lease extensions”.''> In
addition, Respondent disputes any claim of market trends concerning the “favourable chances”
of an incumbent operator, considering that Baltona has only won three out of six tenders in which
it participated in Poland.''*°

The increase of rental fees

780. Respondent submits that the rental fees of the premises would have increased by, at minimum,
H.-H after the modernisation at Terminal 1, as provided by PPL.''"” According to
Deloitte, actual data points to an average minimum increase of mn for commercial areas in the
modernised Terminal 1.!'°*

781. Deloitte Report No. 2 states that, in light of the one-off i’ minimum rent increase in 2015 and
the assumptions adopted in the report, Claimant has suffered no losses. '!*?

782. Finally, Respondent challenges Claimant’s submission that PPL’s information concerning the
current rental fees are doubtful, contending that Claimant does not provide sufficient arguments
to support this submission.''°

783. Respondent therefore disagrees with Claimant that the issue of the rental fees is undisputed
between the Parties. Respondent maintains its position that the average minimum rent for

commercial areas in the new Terminal 1 did increase by [l% compared to the rates in 2011.'"""

The length of the Extension Period

784. Respondent disputes that the renewal would have been for 10 years, as contended by Claimant.
According to Respondent, the current practice is that the agreements are renewed for a period of

an average of five years.'!”

785. At this point, Respondent again notes that Claimant submitted its Scenario C, which includes the
continuation of the Lease Agreements by BH Travel for an “indefinite period”. Respondent
claims that such an approach is “totally unrealistic”.!"#

3) Whether the DCF methodology should be applied as a standalone tool to calculate loss

of profits

786. The Parties disagree as to whether the DCF method may be used as a ‘standalone’ tool to calculate
loss of profits in this case.

Respondent's Position

787. Respondent submits that the DCF method alone cannot give reliable results in this case.'*
Respondent argues that this fact is reflected in Claimant’s submissions, by noting that while
Claimant calculated the amount of damages as EUR 54,212,393 in its Statement of Claim, “with
unchanged facts and without any indication of the appearance of new or extraordinary
circumstances” the same damages were calculated in the Reply to be EUR 84,956,370.!%%

788. According to Respondent, these results show that the same facts applied to the DCF method can
provide two different values. Respondent furthermore explains that the DCF method “is
extremely susceptible to changes in the underlying assumptions made”. Respondent contends
that “even a minor change in the accepted starting assumptions as variables for the calculations
results in a significant difference in the result obtained using the DCF method”.!'4°

789. Respondent relies on the legal doctrine and the statements of legal commentators to assert that:
(i) it is very easy to manipulate the DCF method;!"” (ii) the DCF method used on its own, without
verification by other methods, gives unreliable results;!'** and (iii) contemporaneous market
evidence should be relied on to value corporations and businesses.''°

790. To support its argument as to the unreliability of the DCF method when used alone, Respondent
cites Deloitte’s response to the reasons Mr. Qureshi provided for maintaining the adoption of the
DCF method:

(i) A DCF valuation should be underpinned by realistic financial projections;

Treasury dated 24 June 2015 and 15 July 2015, p. 2, Exhibit R-146.

(ii) in order to limit the subjectivity inherent in the DCF valuation, use of alternative
approaches is recommended by valuation and arbitration practitioners;

(iii) finding true/perfect comparables between different assets/companies can rarely be
achieved in practice, but this does not invalidate the market based approach;

(iv) there are relevant market-derived references available in this case that can be applied as
a high level "sanity cross-check" to the primary DCF valuation; and

(v) the DCF valuation is very sensitive where a large number of assumptions is used in the
calculation. A cross-check of the DCF results to other market metrics is therefore necessary
to ensure that the outcome of the valuation is a reliable approximation to the fair price i.e.
the price at which an asset would exchange hands between a knowledgeable buyer and seller,
acting at arm’s length and in his best economic interest.!!5°

791. Respondent disputes Claimant’s contention that “arbitral tribunals have uniformly uncritically
repeatedly blessed the DCF method as a valid tool to quantify damages, including as a standalone
method”.''*! In one case, Respondent notes, the tribunal considered the DCF method to not be an
appropriate tool to calculate damages of a business that never operated or where the basis for its
projected revenues has not been satisfactorily demonstrated. According to Respondent, that
tribunal acknowledged that using DCF method in these circumstances provides an excessively
speculative outcome. ''

792. In the current proceedings, Respondent notes that Terminal | was not going to continue to be
available for rent, and now does not have space which is identical to the space that was the object
of the Lease A Therefore, Respond ‘ludes that ing of revenue from
shops which have not yet started to operate is highly speculative.'!*?

 

793. In another case, Respondent notes, the tribunal rejected the application of the DCF method
because it was being applied to a loss-making company.''** Respondent recalls that BH Travel
was also generating losses over the years of collaboration with PPL and submits that its overall
financial performance did not significantly improve in 2011.!'°°

794. Respondent argues that the DCF model can be purely speculative given the lack of sufficient
contemporary and/or historic data. Respondent points out that both the First and Second PwC
Reports make optimistic assumptions, notwithstanding the modest amount of data available and
the fact that Baltona was generating losses.''*° Citing legal doctrine, Respondent further contends
that the DCF method is “as good as the data used and the underlying ass

795. In view of the foregoing, Respondent concludes that the use of the DCF method alone cannot
provide reliable results.!'°*

Claimant’s Position

796. Claimant objects to Respondent’s assertion that the DCF method as a standalone tool is not useful
in the present dispute.''*? Claimant argues that “the DCF method is [...] ‘commonly employed
in actual corporate and financial transactions’”.''® Furthermore, Claimant submits that the DCF
method “is the only true method of assessing the value of income-producing assets”.!'°!

797. Claimant also rejects Respondent’s claim that “BH Travel was generating losses over the years
of collaboration with PPL”, and that “arbitral tribunals have been indicating that the use of the
DCF method in the case of loss-making companies should be considered questionable”.''®
Claimant cites arbitral tribunals and legal commentators in support of its contention that the use
of the DCF method is largely accepted as a method of assessing value of income-producing
assets,'!® stating that “investment treaty tribunals have repeatedly blessed the DCF method as a
valid tool to quantify damages, including as a standalone method”.''®* According to Claimant,
Respondent’s argument “significantly misreads” the decisions by investment treaty tribunals
concerning the use of DCF method on a standalone basis.''® Claimant cites investment treaty
tribunals that applied the DCF method as a standalone tool to quantify the investors’ damages,
including CMS v. Argentina, ADC v. Hungary, and Bau v. Thailand."

798. Claimant refers to commentators to support its claim that damages may be quantified using a
DCF model on a standalone basis, “even in the absence of a going concern”.''°7

799. Claimant submits that, in any event, BH Travel was a “going concern”,''®* and that the results of

the Baltona Group corroborate Claimant’s ability to operate on a profitable basis.''

800. Claimant challenges Respondent’s claim that the DCF method is “inherently speculative” and
therefore “it is not only possible but also necessary to use market quantifiers” in order to validate
the DCF calculation.''” In response, Claimant refers to Mr. Qureshi’s evidence that a
benchmarking approach is “not necessary”, and that “DCF can be used on a stand-alone basis as
long as [the underlying] assumptions are accurate, reasonable and reliable”.!'7! Citing
commentators in support, Claimant concludes that “[s]peculation and uncertainty, inherent in any
DCF analysis, can be dealt with by taking conservative estimates of cash flow projections and
application of a higher discount rate”.!'”?

801. Finally, Claimant refers to the remarks of the tribunal in Himpurna v. PT. While the tribunal in
that case acknowledged the inherent and inevitable approximations involved in a DCF calculation
of lost profits, Claimant notes that the tribunal concluded that the “fact that [DCF calculations]

 

use ranges and esti does not imply of the discipline of ic analysis;
nor, when adopted by the arbitrators, does this method imply abandonment of the discipline of

assessing the evidence before them”.

4) Whether other approaches to calculate the damages should be used in conjunction with
the DCF methodology

802. The Parties disagree as to whether the assessment of Claimant’s damages under the DCF method
should be benchmarked against the results of other valuation approaches.

Respondent's Position

803. Respondent asserts that “the DCF methodology is not the only approach and [...] best practice
requires that a valuation produced under one approach is cross-checked against valuation[s]
produced under different approach[es]”.!'”* Respondent thus claims that the calculation should
make reference to market perspectives and other valuation methods.'!7°

for the discussion on the quantum of the loss”.!!°

805. Respondent disputes Claimant’s assertion that the use of other methods has no bearing on the
calculation of damages in this case. According to Respondent, it is not clear why other
benchmarks should not be used to verify the DCF method. In Respondent’s opinion, the
calculation of damages in these proceedings not only can, but should, be verified.!'””

806. Respondent therefore suggests three approaches to cross-check the DCF methodology: (i) an
asset-based approach; (ii) acquisition price; and (iii) market perspective.

‘h

   

ased ay

 

807. Respondent submits that the use of an asset-based approach is justified in this case.'!”*

808. Respondent claims that the use of an asset-based approach is ideal in cases where the value of
future cash flows is insignificant or highly uncertain, like in the present case. In this regard, the
Deloitte Report states that “an asset-based approach is recommended if: future cash flows are
insignificant or highly uncertain (such as in the case of terminated Lease Agreements)”.!!”

809. Respondent reiterates its argument that BH Travel was generating losses for many years and
therefore could not have become profitable in a year. Such a short space of time, according to
Respondent, does not allow for the reliable application of the DCF method.''*°

810. Respondent refers to the findings of the tribunal in Metaclad Corp. v. Mexico as authority for
rejecting the application of the DCF method to assess a business that was not making profit or
where the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish a performance
record.''*! Respondent also points out that Deloitte had concluded that the value of future cash
flows as in the case of the terminated Lease Agreements are insignificant or highly uncertain.'!*?

811. Even if it were assumed that BH Travel’s sales were growing, Respondent submits that future
cash flows remain highly uncertain in light of the risk of termination of the Lease Agreements
for BH Travel’s repeated breaches.''** Because of such uncertainty, Respondent concludes that
the use of the asset-based approach is justified in this case.

812. Respondent explains that the asset-based method would take into account the value of the
investment made and the factors which affected the value of the investments during the period
between the acquisition of Baltona’s stock and its flotation on the Warsaw Stock Exchange.
Additionally, it would consider the impact of the termination of the Lease Agreements by PPL.
on the results currently achieved by Baltona. Accordingly, Respondent submits that “the
calculation of damage to Baltona’s value should be referred to the book value of BH Travel,

increased by the value of Lease Agreements until June 2015 and decreased by the value of any
new operations undertaken by BH Travel after the termination”.!'™

Acquisition price

Respondent points to the discrepancy between the EUR 7.4 million invested by Flemingo
International and the amount of damages claimed of more than EUR 80 million.''** In view of
the disparity between the two amounts, Respondent contends that it is necessary to rely on the
acquisition price or investment price in order to calculate compensation.

Respondent notes that in Tecmed v. Mexico, the tribunal rejected the application of the DCF
method in cases where there was substantial disparity between the actual investment and the
damages claimed, and instead based its award on the acquisition price, plus the amount invested
by the claimant.''** Furthermore, Respondent notes that, in Metaclad, the tribunal regarded the
DCF method as a highly speculative tool and therefore relied on the value of the actual
investment. '!*7

 

Respondent disputes Claimant’s assertion that it has incurred other costs in addition to the
EUR 7.4 million allegedly incurred for Baltona’s shares, namely the amount of USD 26 million
that Claimant claims to have paid for Flemingo International’s shares.''** Respondent submits
that no evidence was presented to support the assertion that Claimant actually incurred costs of
USD 26 million. Respondent argues that it cannot be ruled out that the transaction was only an
accounting operation.!'*?

Market perspective

Respondent submits that other points of reference should be taken into account when estimating
the amount of Claimant’s possible damages, such as:

(i) market capitalization of the Baltona Group and the share of market capitalization which
should be applied to BH Travel; (ii) the decrease in market capitalization of Baltona until the
termination of the Lease Agreements (iii) the value of the shares after the termination of the
Lease Agreements; and (iv) value of BH Travel as compared to a market benchmark (publicly
listed companies with business profile comparable to BH Travel). 11%

Respondent notes that the Deloitte Report adopts a market perspective in its analysis and finds
discrepancies between the lost income claimed and the market value of the Baltona Group.
Deloitte relied on data points which involve shares in “the actual company itself”. According to
Deloitte, market implied values can be derived from the following sources:

(i) _ the price paid by Flemingo entities for the acquisition of Baltona in 2010{;]

(ii) the past and recent stock market capitalisation of Baltona;

(iii) the price paid in 2011 by Baltona to Gerb, Heinemann GmbH for a minority interest in
BH Travel i.e. exactly the same asset that is the subject of the claim. This transaction is

especially relevant since it occurred within a relatively short time of the date of the
claim;

(iv) past and current market multiples implied by the stock market capitalisation of
comparable public companies.

818. First, Respondent submits that during the market capitalisation of Baltona, the investors’ forecast
of the expected financial profits generated by BH Travel was considerably lower than the one
adopted by Mr. Qureshi. A reason for this, Respondent suggests, is that the Lease Agreements
were not as profitable for BH Travel as argued by Claimant and the profits were uncertain.'!"!

819. Respondent stresses that the reorganisation of BH Travel after the acquisition of Baltona by the
Flemingo Group did not bring about the expected financial results.''? Moreover, Respondent
reiterates its view that, on the date of the alleged expropriation, the Lease Agreements had non-
material value for BH Travel due to the issues with PPL. After ending operations at Chopin
Airport, Baltona claimed record sales and an increase of approximately 650% in operating profits
for the third quarter of 2013.''? Therefore, Respondent concludes that the termination of the
Lease Agreements did not damage Claimant’s assets but actually contributed to an increase in
Baltona’s share value.'!*

820. Respondent does not agree with Claimant’s statement that “[t]he value of BH Travel’s shares
after the termination of the Lease Agreements cannot possibly be an indicator of the Claimant’s
lost income stream in a ‘but for’ scenario”.'!°> Respondent explains that Claimant ignores the
fact that Flemingo International made an investment in Baltona, not just BH Travel.'!°°

821. In addition, Respondent submits that “damages cannot be considered without reference to: (i) the
value of the shares of BH Travel at the valuation date (representing the date of the triggering
event, i.e., the Termination), but also (ii) the value of the Baltona Group at Acquisition; and
(iii) the value of the Baltona Group at the valuation date”.'!°7

822. Respondent relies on the Deloitte Report to assert that: “(i) the termination of the Lease
Agreements only affected BH Travel’s business, it had no impact on the business of other
companies from the Baltona Group; (ii) the whole of BH Travel’s business boiled down to the
Lease Agreements; and (iii) BH Travel is a 100% subsidiary of Baltona”.''*

823. Respondent disputes Claimant’s ttion that it is not possible or useful in this case to use market
capitalisation to verify the results of its calculations, because BH Travel is not a publicly listed

 

company.''” Respondent states that, based on Deloitte’s recommendation, the calculation should
include market capitalisation, “where the subject company is listed or its valuation could be
derived from the market capitalisation of the group to which it belongs”. Respondent concludes

that the fact that BH Travel is not publicly listed does not prevent the use of a benchmark in the
form of market capitalisation, since BH Travel is a subsidiary of Baltona, which is a publicly
listed company.'?°° In addition, Respondent recalls that Claimant itself has made reference to
Baltona’s financial results to explain BH Travel’s financial situation.'7""

Respondent further notes that the Deloitte Report states that “[t]he valuation multiples implied
from Mr. Qureshi’s DCF valuation of BH Travel are significantly (up to as many as 21 times
under the Extension Scenario) higher than the median market multiples”.'"” Respondent points
out that Deloitte Report No. 2 identifies multiples implied by market capitalisation of Baltona
that are a reasonable check for the DCF results.

Respondent also contends that BH Travel and Baltona’s situations cannot be considered in
isolation from each other. Respondent recalls that, before the termination of the Lease
Agreements, BH Travel’s activities constituted around 40% of Baltona’s business.'?"*

Respondent also disputes Claimant’s challenge to its use of a market benchmark as an indicator
of the value of BH Travel.'*°° Respondent states that the fact the scholars and practitioners cited
by Claimant disapprove of the use of a market benchmark'*"* does not prove that the use of this
quantifier in this case is not justified. Respondent notes that Deloitte provides counter-arguments
in its Report No. 2 in this respect.'”””

Respondent concedes that no method is ideal and clarifies that it is not arguing for a single method
of calculation. Respondent reiterates, however, its position that the DCF method is highly
speculative and needs to be verified with prices paid for similar assets.'** According to
Respondent, the DCF-based results elaborated by Deloitte are in line with selected market
benchmarks.'”

Additionally, Respondent refers to the approach adopted by the tribunal in Yukos v. Russian
Federation during the calculation of damages phase. According to Respondent, the tribunal
acknowledged a “series of errors” in the claimant’s DCF valuation of Yukos. As a result, the
tribunal applied a market method to the valuation of damages and finally estimated the amount
of damages as USD 50 billion, instead of USD 114 billion initially requested and estimated by
the DCF method.'?!°

Lastly, Respondent states that “the fact [that the] companies proposed by Deloitte do not perfectly
reflect BH Travel’s situation does not prevent using the market benchmark approach
the case with Yukos”. In any event, Respondent notes that Deloitte maintains that their choice of

831.

Claimant submits that the use of an asset-based approach is not appropriate in this case because
it does not accurately reflect the value of a continuing business, like BH Travel. In view of this,
Claimant states, an asset-based approach could produce a less reliable result than income-based
or market-based methods.'?'? Claimant concludes that the use of an asset-based approach is
justified only when “future cash flows are insignificant or highly uncertain”,'*!* which, Claimant

argues, is not the case in the present dispute.

832. Claimant disputes Respondent's claim that the Metaclad award supports the use of an asset-based
approach." In that case, the tribunal noted that future profits cannot be used to determine fair
market value if an enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish a
performance record, or has failed to make a profit. According to Claimant, BH Travel had been
operating at Chopin Airport for more than four years, and had thus been operating “for a

sufficiently long time to establish a performance record”. '7!°

Acquisition price

833. Claimant disagrees that the amounts spent in relation to the purchase of Baltona’s shares should
be taken into account when calculating quantum.’ According to Claimant, historical costs
should not mechanically be used as a “good indicator” of the market value of an investment.'?!
In addition, Claimant contends that such an approach would not satisfy the full compensation
requirement of international law, which requires that the award must be equivalent to the
investment’s fair market value.'?!°

834. Claimant refers to Mr. Qureshi’s evidence to contend that the price of the Baltona Group as at
the acquisition date is not comparable to the loss assessment. According to Mr. Qureshi, at the
time of acquisition, “an average investor may have underestimated the growth perspectives and

Claimant argues that other kinds of contributions were given to Baltona, such as loans,'?”! know-

836. Claimant also disputes that the awards in Metaclad and Tecmed support Respondent's effort to
establish that the amounts invested by the Flemingo Group are relevant for the purposes of the
quantification of Claimant’s damages, arguing that the tribunals in those cases would have
reached different conclusions if they had had data on the operations of the relevant businesses. '7°5

Market perspective
Market capitalisation of Baltona

837. First, Claimant disputes the use of the market capitalisation of the Baltona Group as a relevant
indicator of the losses suffered by BH Travel. Claimant notes that BH Travel is not a listed
company and therefore Claimant disputes the relevance of comparing Mr. Qureshi’s valuation of
the lost income stream with the portion of Baltona Group’s market capitalisation applicable to
BH Travel.'?4 Furthermore, Claimant notes that investment treaty tribunals (like CMS and
Enron) have held that the “market capitalization of a company is often not a sound indicator of
fair market value”.'?> According to Claimant, Respondent did not address in its Rejoinder the
significance of the case law cited, nor did it address Mr. Qureshi’s factual finding concerning the
small percentage of publicly traded shares and the illiquid nature Baltona’s trading history.'”?°

termination of the Lease Agreements is relevant to the calculation.'””’ Claimant contends that the
value of BH Travel would have been different if Respondent had not breached its Treaty
obligations. Claimant concludes that investment treaty tribunals have also “consistently”
excluded post-valuation date factors that result from the relevant State’s bilateral investment

companies used by Deloitte are “at different stages of development compared to BH Travel, as
they are large enterprises with established positions” while BH Travel “was a company at its
development stage”.!° Claimant also notes that arbitral tribunals have not favoured the
market-based method of market multiples"!

According to the table provided by Claimant, both Deloitte reports considered eleven “peer

occurred within a relatively short time of the date of the claim”.'***

Claimant submits that “the price allocated to [the] BH Travel minority shareholding under the
Heinemann [Share Purchase Agreement] is not representative of the fair market value of
BH Travel as on the valuation date of 17 February 2012, and therefore has no bearing upon the
quantification of the Claimant’s damages”.'?*

According to Claimant, the Heinemann transaction does not meet the conditions, as provided by
case law, to be used as an indicator of fair market value of an investment.'° Claimant points to
CME vy. Czech Republic, in which the tribunal did not value the expropriated company based
upon the price that had been paid for a 5.8% shareholding one year before the expropriation. The
CME tribunal stated that a minor inaccuracy in the pricing of the minority share “would magnify
into a serious error when valuing the 100 per cent shareholding”.'*""

The tribunal in SPP v. Egypt adopted a similar approach, according to Claimant. In SPP, the
tribunal declined to treat the past sales of minority shares (one for 25% and the other for the
repurchase of some of those shares) as an indicator of the whole company’s fair market value.
Claimant notes that the tribunal in SPP found that “there was a very limited number of
transactions and there was no market as such for the shares that were sold”.'*

Claimant submits that: (i) the Heinemann transaction captures no more than a 10% shareholding
in BH Travel;'* (ii) the transaction does not capture the “control premium” that a buyer would
pay;'** (iii) the transaction was concluded in the context of a broader settlement agreement
between BH Travel and Heinemann dated 8 March 2011,'™*° and the price allocated to the shares
was affected by approximately “17 economic components”! and non-market
considerations;!” and (iv) Deloitte fails to neutralise the impact of the various economic
components, such as the impact of the parties’ other business objectives provided in the

the original): (i) “The shareholding sold is large enough to avoid the danger of magnification of a pricing
inaccuracy;” (ii) “The transactions(s) must be at arm’s length;” (iii) “[T]he negotiated price must not be

Whether Claimant made substantial changes to the amount claimed from the Statement of
Claim to Claimant’s Reply

Respondent's Position

In its Rejoinder, Respondent argues that Claimant changed the amount of damages claimed from
its Statement of Claim to its Reply. Respondent argues that Claimant originally requested (in its
Statement of Claim) EUR 54,212,393 in compensation for all damages allegedly incurred.
However, in Claimant’s Reply the amounts claimed for both the Base Period and Extension
Period lost profits were increased and the total amount requested reached EUR 84,956,370.'2°
The comparative figures provided by Respondent are arranged in the table below:

 

 

 

 

 

Claimant’s claimed damages | Statement of Claim Claimant’s Reply
Actual losses EUR 1,070,373 EUR 1,070,373
Base Period lost profits EUR 17,082,271 EUR 26,786,860
Extension Period lost profits EUR 36,059,749 EUR 57,099,140
TOTAL EUR 54,212,393 EUR 84,956,370

 

 

 

 

 

Respondent notes that the amounts claimed in Claimant’s Reply as Base Period and Extension
Period lost profits increased by nearly EUR 31 million.'?*!

Respondent argues that the amount has not been increased by capitalising the variable indicator
or capitalising interest, but by generating a completely new amount of the claim. Respondent

contends that no new events have arisen in the meantime and therefore there is no justification

for Claimant’s increase. to “Claimant i i the

amount of the claims asserted” in the proceedings.'**

Respondent states that it “does not agree with Claimant’s assertion that the change in the amount
of the compensation asserted can be treated as an amendment of the [original] claim”.'** In this
regard, Respondent argues that Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Rules, concerning the amendment
or supplementation of claims, should be interpreted narrowly.'?*°

Respondent states that it should be concluded that Claimant intentionally understated the amount
of the claims in its Statement of Claim, thereby limiting Respondent’s right to a fair defence
(arguing that it would have prepared the Statement of Defence differently and the Deloitte Report
would have been different in scope).'?°°

Claimant’s Position

Claimant explains in its Reply that, as in any quantification of damages in a “but for” scenario,
Mr. Qureshi’s calculation in the First PwC Report relied on certain assumptions and data that
were available at the time. In the First PwC Report, Mr. Qureshi assessed the damages to be
EUR 54,212,393 (before interest).!?*”

For the conclusion of the Second PwC Report, Claimant explains, Mr. Qureshi relies on “new
data in the record and other procedures he has performed”.'?** For instance, the Second PwC
Report takes into account the technical data and forecasts provided in the Mirza Report
concerning PAX and SPP, which was submitted with Claimant’s Reply, including post-valuation
date data and events.'?*? Claimant stresses that the calculation of the damages should consider
post-valuation date data and events since they can help provide a more precise assessment of the
investment. '7°°

Accordingly, Mr. Qureshi’s calculations of damages in the Second PwC Report (Claimant’s
Reply) amount to EUR 84,956,370, '*"' which corresponds to the sum of: (i) EUR 1,070,370, for
actual losses;!?? (ii) EUR 26,786,860, for Base Period loss of profits;!?°> and (iii)
EUR 57,099,140, for Extension Period loss of profits.!°

Mr. Qureshi also provides a calculation of lost profits based on only pre-valuation date data and
events (i.e., data and events prior to 17 February 2012), in case the Tribunal finds this to be
warranted. Using such data, the total damages would amount to: EUR 15,039,210, for Base
Period loss of profits;'*°* EUR 26,431,330, for Extension Period loss of profits.'?°

  

 

Mr. Qureshi confirmed during the hearing that he had made changes in the Second PwC Report
based on new information contained in the Mirza Report and new information concerning

During the course of the arbitral proceedings either party may amend or supplement his claim or
defence unless the arbitral tribunal considers it inappropriate to allow such amendment having
regard to the delay in making it or prejudice to other parties or any other circumstances.

F. Tribunal’s Analysis

864. The Tribunal has established (see paras. 529-560 and 590-597 above) that Respondent breached
Articles 3(2) and 5 of the Treaty as a result of PPL’s termination of the Lease Agreements on
16 February 2012 with immediate effect and without compensation, by hindering further
exploitation of the duty-free shops, and by obtaining BH Travel’s eviction from its premises at
Chopin Airport on 14 August 2012.

865. The Treaty itself does not set forth the standard of compensation for these breaches. Under
customary international law, as codified in Article 31(1) of the ILC Articles, Claimant is entitled
to full reparation in an amount sufficient to wipe out all of the injury it has incurred due to
Respondent’s wrongful acts. Full reparation encompasses both actual losses (damnum emergens)
and loss of profits (/ucrum cessans).

1) Damages for actual losses (damnum emergens)

866. Claimant argues that the actual losses that BH Travel incurred as a result of the unlawful measures
amount to EUR 1,326,690. In Claimant’s view, it is therefore entitled to EUR 1,070,370 for
actual losses, which corresponds to the 80.68% share in BH Travel that Claimant held at the time
of the termination of the Lease Agreements. The actual losses claimed by Claimant comprise:

“Operating Losses” and “One-Off Termination Costs”.

Operating Losses

Claimant argues that BH Travel’s Operating Losses amounted to EUR 237,449 with respect to
the termination of the Lease Agreements of the Baltona Airport shop and the Baltona Accessories
shop. These shops remained in operation until BH Travel’s eviction on 14 August 2012, but were
hindered by PPL in several ways and thus generated less than normal revenues. Claimant claims
that the Operating Losses related to these two shops concern “the negative result of revenues
generated by these shops between 17 February and 14 August [2012] minus the costs of the goods
sold, salaries of remaining employees and other costs incurred in the period”.'?*?

The compensation for this loss should, in Respondent’s view, be claimed as lost profits.'?**

The Tribunal observes that a claim for operating losses and a claim for lost profits start from
different premises: while a claim for lost profits assumes that operations have ceased, operating
losses supposes that the contract is still operational but not correctly performed. Moreover, the
two claims are of a different nature: while a claim for future lost profits would remain
hypothetical in nature, a claim for operation losses can be based upon actual data.

The amount claimed by Claimant is not much different from the amount accepted by
Respondent’s expert.'7*4 Claimant has calculated the salaries of remaining employees (HR costs)
and COGS on the basis of BH Travel’s actual records of operation and Respondent has agreed
with these figures.'** The Tribunal is willing to accept this claim for Claimant’s share of
BH Travel’s Operating Losses of EUR 237,499.

One-Off Termination Costs

Claimant alleges that BH Travel suffered damages for One-Off Termination Costs, in the amount
of EUR 1,089,243, made up of: severance payments, liquidation of fixed assets, and transport of
inventory to other locations. The Tribunal does not agree with Respondent’s allegation that
BH Travel could have foreseen the termination of the Lease Agreements with immediate effect
because BH Travel had triggered the termination itself by persistently not performing its
obligations. Indeed, from the summary of facts (see paras. 184-190 above), it appears that these
alleged non-performances could not give rise to the termination of the Lease Agreements.

The Tribunal is aware that Respondent has not been in a position to verify the data from which
Claimant has calculated the One-Off Termination Costs. However, it observes that the experts
from both sides, PwC and Deloitte, are highly regarded accounting firms, and that Respondent’s
expert did not challenge the commercial data on which its counterpart based its calculation.
Rather, Respondent’s criticism concerned the methodology and computation.'?** In any event,

128 The Tribunal notes that by claiming the Operating Losses of the Baltona Airport and Baltona Accessories
shops up to 14 August 2012, Claimant must consider these shops to be operational until that date. As such,
any hypothetical suspension and related extension of the Lease Agreements for these shops would only start
as of 14 August 2012.

while it is true that when the respective Lease Agreements would have come to an end, staff
severance payments would have to be paid, fixed assets would need to be liquidated and
remaining inventory would need to be transported, the circumstances are somewhat different
when all the Lease Agreements are terminated early, on the same day and with immediate effect.
In such circumstances, Claimant had no opportunity to mitigate its damages. Taking the
foregoing into account, the Tribunal considers that it would be appropriate to compensate
Claimant for its share of BH Travel’s One-Off Termination Costs, which Claimant has estimated
to be EUR 1,089,243.

Accordingly, the Tribunal is prepared to accept that BH Travel suffered actual losses of
EUR 1,326,690 (i.e., Operating Losses of EUR 237,449 and One-Off Termination Costs of
EUR 1,089,243). The Tribunal notes that this amount will need to be adjusted to take into account
the appropriate amount of Claimant's indirect interest in BH Travel (see paras. 933-934 below).

2) Damages for loss of profits (ucrum cessans)

. As indicated above, the breach of the Treaty was the termination of the Lease Agreements on 16

February 2012 with immediate effect and without compensation. In order to establish full
compensation, the Tribunal has to reconstruct in a “but for” scenario the conditions which
previously existed as if the breach of the Treaty had never occurred and the Lease Agreements
had continued to take their expected course.'7*7

It is noted that the Parties disagree on the appropriate “but for” scenario. In particular they
disagree:

a. whether, absent breach of the Treaty, the Lease Agreements would have been
terminated or instead suspended and allowed to continue to the end of their original
lease terms (i.e., the Base Period) in the modernised Terminal 1; and

b. whether, absent breach of the Treaty, there was any possibility of the Lease Agreements
being renewed after the Base Period for a further period (i.e., the Extension Period).

. The Tribunal will first address damages for loss of profits in the Base Period and the issue of

whether the modernisation of Terminal 1 should be taken into account in the damages
calculations.

Choice of Scenario A

As already noted above, the Tribunal requested the Parties’ experts to provide the following

Scenario Calculations:

a. Scenario A required a calculation of damages based on the assumptions that Terminal 1 was
not modernised, and the Lease Agreements continued to the end of the Base Period, as well
as some increases in the PAX and other operational improvements, if any.

b. Scenario B required a calculation of damages based on the assumptions that the Lease
Agreements were suspended for the duration of the modernisation of Terminal 1, and then

287 See e.g, Azurix v. Argentina Award, para. 417, Exhibit CL-10; see also, inter alia, American Manufacturing
& Trading, Inc. v. Republic of Zaire Final Award, para. 6, Exhibit CL-140, and other cases, see supra footnote
817.

879.

continued to run to the end of their Base Period in the new Terminal 1.

Claimant argues for the application of Scenario B. Claimant alleges that, in a “but for” scenario,
the Lease Agreements of Terminal 1 would not have been terminated, and instead would have
been suspended during the modernisation and then continued in the modernised Terminal | on
1 January 2015. This outcome, in Claimant’s view, would have been achieved either through
good faith negotiations between the contracting parties or through application to the Polish
courts. In Claimant’s view, this would have resulted in the terms of each of the Lease Agreements
being extended as from 1 January 2015 by the time of the suspension.

The Tribunal notes that under Claimant’s suggested Scenario B, with the suspension and
proportionate extension of the Terminal 1 Lease Agreements, the remaining time on the terms of
those Lease Agreements would only run in the new premises of the modernised Terminal | for
the following number of months:

880. Scenario B is not a realistic scenario. The retail space in Terminal 1 was liquidated as a
consequence of the modernisation works. The existing Lease Agreements in Terminal | therefore
could not have been extended. Instead, new leases for new commercial spaces would have been
tendered. The expected course of events would thus have been that the Lease Agreements in
Terminal 1 would have been terminated because of the impending modernisation with full
compensation. The appropriate “but for” scenario, is therefore Scenario A.

881. Indeed, termination with compensation was what Polish law, i.e., the Airport Act (which contains
specific rules governing the preparation and implementation of investments concerning public
airports) provided for in its Article 27(3): “[l]oss suffered as a result of termination of agreements
[...] shall be subject to compensation”. The Tribunal is aware that the Lease Agreements did

"288 The Lease Agreements for the Baltona Perfumery and Baltona Classic shops had a guaranteed period of lease
of 84 months from the date of signing the Lease Agreements. In addition, both Lease Agreements provided
that the guarantee period shall be extended for a further period of 36 months if certain requirements were met
(including the performance of adaptation works), Respondent alleges that the Lease Agreements for the
Baltona Perfumery and Baltona Classic shops would not have automatically been extended for 36 months
because BH Travel failed to carry out the required 3-yearly adaptation and refreshing (see ll Ms. [IM]
Witness Statement, para. 12, Exhibit RWS-4; Second | Mr. [PN] Witness Statement, paras. 11-14,
Exhibit RWS-3). Accordingly, for the purposes of the table calculating the approximate time remaining on
the Baltona Perfumery and Baltona Classic Lease Agreements, the Tribunal provides two time periods, the
first excluding the 36 month extension, and the second including the 36 month extension.

not foresee termination because of investments and modernisation of Chopin Airport. However,
as the Lease Agreements were ruled by Polish law, the Airport Act introduced this mode of
termination into the contractual relationship.

Theoretically, it could have been possible for PPL and Claimant to work out whatever
arrangement would suit them in respect of the Terminal 1 Lease Agreements, instead of going
for the simple termination with compensation, as provided for by Airport Act. Indeed, in a general
manner, negotiations about alternative solutions still remain possible. However, the results of
such negotiations cannot be predicted with sufficient certainty. In addition, Claimant fails to
submit evidence in this respect. Moreover — and more crucially — when the decision to terminate
became imminent, the relations between PPL and BH Travel at that time excluded any possibility
of negotiating, in good faith, an extension of the Lease Agreements. The probability of such
alternative arrangements were extremely small and Claimant has not proven the contrary. Indeed,
there was extreme animosity between PPL and BH Travel, which started in December 2011,'7*
and culminated in numerous court proceedings in 2012 and in the introduction of the present
arbitration proceedings in January 2014. All this excludes the assumption that PPL would be
willing to allocate leases for duty-free shops to BH Travel once Terminal | had been modernised
in 2015.

PPL’s desire to terminate the Lease Agreements was already obvious before 16 February 2012,
perhaps because it already had in mind BH Travel’s replacement for the exploitation of the
duty-free shops. Moreover, as the Airport Act indicates, terminating was the most evident
solution. A resumption of the Terminal 1 Lease Agreements after 34.5 months in a completely
new setting, with substantially bigger surfaces and different sales concepts, would have raised
delicate problems of contract adaptation and would therefore have led to unpredictability and
insecurity.

Consequently, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimant that in the “but for” scenario the Lease
Agreements in Terminal 1 would not have been terminated on 16 February 2012, that the leases
of the Terminal | duty-free shops would have been suspended for the period of the renovation of
the Terminal (from 16 February 2012 until 30 December 2014), and that the 34.5 months’
suspension would have been added to the period of the respective leases.

Besides, when BH Travel’s Lease Agreements in Terminal 1 were terminated, the balance of all
their contractual terms in the Base Period was rather limited, as noted in the table in paragraph
879 above. Even in the hypothesis that the Terminal 1 Lease Agreements’ terms would have been
extended by the 34.5 months’ suspension, there would not have been many remaining months
available for an alleged “adapted” continuation of each of these Lease Agreements. It is for
instance very unlikely that BH Travel would have started to install and exploit the Baltona Kid’s
World shop with a remaining lease period of only 8 months. It also remains doubtful that
BH Travel would have engaged in the installation and exploitation of a new Airport Shop with
only 13 months remaining. It may even be uncertain whether it would have installed and exploited
the Baltona Esprit, Baltona Accessories, and Baltona Bestseller shops with less than 4 years
remaining. Moreover, it is not certain whether BH Travel would have met the requirements under
the Lease Agreements for the Baltona Perfumery and Baltona Classic shops that would allow the

"2% The fact that the relations between PPL and BH Travel seemed less strained before 8 December 2011 is
irrelevant. In any event, Respondent has pointed out that even before 8 December 2011, Claimant, at least in
Respondent's view, had not perfectly performed its obligations under the Lease Agreements.

lease terms of those shops to be extended by 36 months. As such, it is also not certain whether
these shops would have been installed and exploited.

As the Tribunal has noted, five to seven years is apparently the minimal timeframe for the
granting of an airport shop concession.

In addition, it is noted that the Lease Agreements of the Baltona Arrival, Baltona Jewellery,
Warehouse, and Social Rooms in Terminal 2 would not have been affected by the modernisation
of Terminal 1, and thus in the Scenario A “but for” scenario would not be subject to suspension
and corresponding extension. This would mean that, absent the termination without
compensation on 16 February 2012, the Lease Agreements for the Terminal 2 premises would
have continued until:

PAX and SPP

As stated above, the Tribunal considers that Scenario A, which assumes that Terminal | was not
modernised and that the Lease Agreements in both Terminals | and 2 would have continued until
the end of their original contract terms, is the most appropriate measure of Claimant’s damages
in the “but for” scenario applicable in this case. Had the Lease Agreements been terminated with
compensation, the compensation would have been calculated as the loss of profits that would
have been earned by Claimant if the Lease Agreements in both Terminals had continued until the
end of their respective terms without interruption in the un-modernised Terminal 1 and in
Terminal 2.

The Tribunal will in this Scenario A assume some increases in the rate of passenger traffic (PAX)
and spending (SPP).

In Respondent’s view, in Scenario A, the PAX capacity would be limited to 15 million passengers
in 2020 due to operational and environmental constraints. However, the relevant period to
calculate lost profits only stretches until 2018. Mr. Mirza, the industry expert who submitted the
most optimistic PAX projections, estimated the PAX in 2018 at 13.8 million. Consequently, the
issue of whether, in the long run, PAX could exceed 15 million is not relevant for the present
damages calculation in the Base Period.

180

891. Claimant has considered the PAX growth in relation to all Polish airports and not specifically to
Chopin Airport, which is the most developed and utilised airport in Poland. Due to the fact that
Chopin Airport is the most developed airport in Poland, Respondent considers that it has a lower
than average potential for future growth in PAX and SPP. Accordingly, the PAX and SPP
comparisons with other airports have limited relevance.

892. However, in the Base Period the Tribunal has to assess loss of profits in the years 2012 to 2018
only. As this period already belongs largely to the past, the Tribunal can base its estimates upon
actual PAX and SPP numbers for Chopin Airport. The actual PAX data for the years 2012 to
2014 are available. Actual PAX data for the years 2012 to 2014 have been submitted by
Claimant,’ with which Respondent agrees in its Scenario A calculation.’

893. For the few years still required (2015 to 2018), the Tribunal can look to Claimant’s and
Respondent’s forecast figures in Scenario A, which again do not differ.'?°”

894. Respondent is of the view that the SPP factor for BH Travel would have only increased as of
2012 in accordance with the projected level of inflation. Respondent argues that Polish GDP is
less relevant as a key driver for SPP as only a part of the relevant consumers are Polish.
Claimant’s expert, Mr. Mirza, provides SPP projections premised on the specific features of BH
Travel and Chopin Airport with benchmarking and comparison adjustments. The Tribunal notes
that in Claimant’s Scenario Al and Scenario A2 calculations, Mr. Mirza adopted an SPP forecast
based on the assumption that Terminal 1 was not modernised (i.e., disregarding his previous
modernisation-related assumptions). On this basis, Mr. Mirza estimates that BH Travel would
have continued to operate in Terminal 1, and due to better management, the SPP would have
grown from EUR [if in 2011 to EUR If in 2031 at an average of [% in real terms.'”* Based
on the foregoing, the Tribunal is prepared to accept this adjusted SPP figure.

 

895. The Parties have discussed whether the spread of the shopping across a wider base and the
modernisation of the shops would have increased or, on the contrary, diluted the SPP. The
Tribunal does not consider this issue to be relevant in Scenario A because it does not contemplate
the scenario of a 34.5 month extension of the Lease Agreements and a re-instalment of BH Travel
in the renovated Terminal 1.

Profit margin (Gi Margin,

  

896. The Tribunal has to establish the Gross Margin of the sales, i.e., the difference between the total
sales revenue and the total COGS, divided by the total sales revenue. For Claimant, the Gross
Margin of the shops was on average 46.8% in 2010 and would have improved by 1% in 2012 and
2013, and then by 0.5% from 2014 onwards.'”” For Respondent, the Gross Margin would have

remained at 46.9%."

The Tribunal notes again that Mr. Qureshi provided two calculations for Scenario A: Scenario Al
in which he assumed that BH Travel’s HR costs and COGS would have increased proportionally
with future sales revenues; and Scenario A2 in which he assumed that BH Travel’s HR costs and
COGS would have increased with inflation only.'*"! The Tribunal is of the view that while it may
be that BH Travel might have continued to improve its efficiency, it is not clear that its HR costs
and COGS would only have increased in line with inflation, notably because increased sales
revenue obviously requires more personnel and more stock. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds it
reasonable in the circumstances to adopt the HR costs and COGS figures provided in Claimant’s
Scenario AI calculation.

Discount rate

The Parties also disagree on the applicable discount rate. Claimant has relied on inflation
forecasts provided by the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the
Warsaw Independent Center for Economic Studies.”

The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that the discount rate and a correct assessment of the damages
can be based upon post-valuation date data and events. The use of such data can help with a more
precise assessment of the damages.'*" The Tribunal prefers to establish the discount rate on the
basis of post-valuation date data, instead of calculating the discount rate on the valuation date
and allocating pre-judgment interest to reflect the time value of money up to the date of the
Award.

 

The Tribunal agrees that the rates of Polish government bonds, adopted by Claimant’s expert,
already reflect Polish country risk. Moreover, the discount rate does not need to be increased by
a size premium as BH Travel, although a relatively small company, is part of a larger consortium.
For Claimant the discount rate is 6.6%, i.e., the cost of equity.'*°* Respondent submits that the
cost of equity of Dufry ACS, a leading company in the same business sector, is 9.8-11.7%. In
Respondent’s view, BH Travel’s cost of equity should be higher. In light of the foregoing, the
Tribunal estimates a discount rate of 8% to be justified.

The Tribunal finds an adequate causal relationship between the termination of the Lease
Agreements and BH Travel’s financial losses. It does not accept Respondent’s argument that the
termination of the Lease Agreements had a beneficial impact simply because the sales revenue
of Baltona had substantially increased when compared with the increased sales revenue of one of
.e., BH Travel (which was also lucrative, albeit allegedly to a lesser extent).
While Respondent argues that BH Travel had been making losses in 2009 and that its financial
performance did not significantly improve in 2011, the Tribunal notes that, according to
Respondent’s expert,'°° between 2009 and 2011 its sales revenue had increased by 36% and its

EBITA margin (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortisation) had increased by 4.8%.

Moreover, the Tribunal does not agree with Respondent’s argument that it was BH Travel’s
behaviour that had led to the termination of the Lease Agreements, and so PPL (and therefore
Respondent also) cannot be held liable for the termination. The Tribunal has already established
that the pretextual termination by PPL triggered Respondent’s responsibility under the Treaty.

Valuation date

The Tribunal does not agree with Claimant that the breach began on 8 December 2011 with PPL’s
failure to consider any solution other than the termination of the Lease Agreements by mutual
agreement but without any compensation. PPL’s attempts to obtain termination without
compensation by themselves do not constitute a breach of the Treaty. The actual termination of
the Lease Agreements on 16 February 2012 was the first illegal act under the Treaty which led
to BH Travel’s forceful expulsion from its premises at the Chopin Airport on 14 August 2012. In
any event, the Tribunal notes that the valuation date put forward by Claimant is 17 February
2012.17

In the Tribunal’s view, the appropriate valuation date is 16 February 2012 (“Valuation Date as
determined by the Tribunal”), i.e., the date on which the Lease Agreements were terminated,
and not 17 February 2012, the date the customs authorities sealed some of BH Travel’s shops.
This sealing was only a consequence of the termination, on the previous day, of the Lease
Agreements with immediate effect. Besides, of the shops affected by the termination, only 6 were
duty-free shops and 3 were not located in the DFZ.

  

is

Claimant disputes Respondent’s claim that the valuation of Flemingo DutyFree’s losses should
be based upon the current indirect interest in BH Travel and not upon the indirect interest as on
the valuation date.'°°* The Tribunal accepts that Claimant’s indirect interest in BH Travel at the
time of the breach is relevant and therefore, for the purpose of calculating Claimant’s damages,
retains Claimant’s indirect interest of 80.68% in BH Travel (see paras. 933-934 below).

Growth projection

Respondent alleges that, based on BH Travel’s past performance, BH Travel would not have
achieved financial profits in the future. The Tribunal, however, accepts Claimant’s growth
projections for the relevant future years, based upon the 2014-2015 performances of the Baltona
Group and the assumption of improved management.

Method of calculating loss

The Parties have extensively discussed whether a DCF analysis is the proper method to assess
loss of profits, and whether it can be used on a standalone basis. Respondent considers the DCF
method as being too susceptible to changes in the underlying assumptions to be used
independently to quantify damages, referring to Franck Charles Arif v. Republic of Moldova in
support of its contentions.’ However, in that case, the duty-free shops had never entered into
operation or had been open for only a few days. In the present case, by contrast, BH Travel had

183

already operated shops for more than four years. Moreover, in the Franck Charles Arif case, the
tribunal did not have recourse to the alternative standards Respondent proposes, but in fact relied
on a wasted cost calculation.

908. Respondent argues that the DCF method may only be applied to a going concern, which,
Respondent submits, BH Travel was not. However, in the Tribunal’s view, the BH Travel shops
had been operational for more than four years — a sufficient period to allow for a projection of
lost profits because of early termination.

909. Respondent considers that the DCF method should be combined with a market-based approach.
Respondent also submits that other valuation methods — such as the value of BH Travel’s assets,
the value of BH Travel shares after termination, and the value of BH Travel compared to a market
benchmark — should be used.

910. The Tribunal recognises that approximation in DCF calculations is inherent and inevitable, as
has been recognised by the tribunal in Himpurna v PT, among others.'*!° The determination of
future expected cash flows is not “rocket science”. However, the Tribunal is of the view that the
DCF method remains an adequate way to assess the net present value of the income produced
under BH Travel’s Lease Agreements for their remaining terms.

  

911. The Tribunal also notes that, because the Tribunal does not find an extension of the Lease
Agreements likely (see paras. 921-931 below), and compensation is most appropriately
determined in accordance with Scenario A, the DCF method is not being used in this case to
project profits far into the future.

912. The Tribunal here derives comfort from the fact that the compensation for lost profits covers
mainly past months, and that it is only for two of the Lease Agreements (Baltona Perfumery and
Baltona Classic) that a projection of lost profits until October 2018'*'! would be required.

'310 Himpurna v. PT, reprinted in 25 Y. B, COM. ARB. 13,103 (Berm.-Indon. 2000), p. 102, Exhibit CL-116;
See supra para. 801.

1311 As previously noted, the Lease Agreements for the Baltona Perfumery and Baltona Classic shops had a
guaranteed period of lease of 84 months from the date of signing the Lease Agreements. In addition, both
Lease Agreements provided that the guarantee period shall be extended for a further period of 36 months if
certain requirements were met (including the performance of adaptation works). Respondent alleges that the
Lease Agreements for the Baltona Perfumery and Baltona Classic shops would not have automatically been
extended for 36 months because BH Travel failed to carry out the required adaptation and refreshing. However,
the Tribunal assumes that, in view of the commercial importance of attractive shops and an extension, BH
Travel would most likely have engaged in the necessary adaptations and refreshing were it not for the pending
modernisation which would have made such works superfluous. PPL could not, in good faith, require such
works so close to the planned closing of the shops. Moreover, if PPL would have considered these works
nevertheless required, in the given circumstances, it should have drawn BH Travel’s attention to the
insufficiency of the existing installation. Accordingly, the Tribunal is prepared to accept the period of 10 years
for the terms of the Lease Agreements of the Baltona Perfumery and Baltona Classic shops (i., including the
36 month extension) for the purposes of assessing Claimant’s damages in the Base Period under Scenario Al.

Indeed, as the Tribunal does not need to assess the potential cash flow from new shops with an
unknown cost structure and commercial strategy, the DCF method is not too speculative for the
estimates of the potential cash flow for the few remaining years in the closed duty-free shops.'*!°
Moreover, the limited DCF analysis that is taking place can be underpinned by realistic financial
projections. The use of ranges and estimates does not imply abandonment of the analysis of
evidence and the discipline of economic analysis.'*!°

Other methods to assess damages

As stated above, Respondent argues that — besides the DCF method — other valuation standards
should be applied.

32 The Baltona Airport shop remained in operation until 14 August 2012.

3B The Baltona Accessories shop remained in operation until 14 August 2012.

‘51 Tt is unclear whether The shop Bestsellers (Southern Concourse) is located in Terminal A, i.e., Terminal 1
(see Lease Agreement between PPL and BH Travel (Bestseller) dated 29 September 2010, Exhibit C-28).
However, apparently no access to that shop has been blocked (see Decision of the District Court of Warsaw
dated 24 February 2012, Exhibit C-90).

Respondent suggests, inter alia, the BH Travel share price. Respondent refers to the price
Heinemann received in March 2001 for the sale of a mere 10% of BH Travel shares. The Tribunal
does not consider this price relevant for the valuation of the prospect of profits for the years 2012
and following. Indeed, as confirmed by CME v. Czech Republic'*"’ and SPP v. Egypt,'*'* from
the acquisition price for a small minority of shares, which were not “cloaked with company
control” (i.e., they did not have a company control premium), one should not deduce the value of
a company. Moreover, the few shares were transferred in a global settlement which also
encompassed a setoff for unpaid deliveries of goods and future supply conditions.

The Tribunal similarly does not consider the book value of the Lease Agreements and other assets
or the value of BH Travel shares at the moment of termination to be relevant. The Tribunal is not
assessing the price of assets, and therefore does not need benchmarks to do so, contrary to what
Respondent suggests.'*!°

Respondent has also discussed Baltona’s financial position, its market capitalisation and
forecasts. However, the Tribunal considers the financial position of Baltona to be equally
irrelevant for the purposes of assessing BH Travel’s lost profits. Although BH Travel
encompasses some 40% of Baltona’s activities, there are no grounds to assume that its
profitability is the same as Baltona’s overall profitability.

The Tribunal also does not see a need to make use of benchmarks related to other companies
from the sector.'3?° These benchmarks are not only difficult to select, but are unrelated to the
profits lost by BH Travel in respect of the specific Lease Agreements at issue.

The amount for which Baltona acquired BH Travel’s shares, or the amount for which Claimant
acquired Flemingo International and became the indirect shareholder of BH Travel, are similarly
irrelevant.

The Tribunal also does not consider the amounts invested by the Flemingo Group to be relevant
for determining BH Travel’s value and loss of value after the termination of the Lease
Agreements, contrary to what Respondent has suggested.

 

    

Agreement:

Claimant also claims compensation for its loss of chance to have the Lease Agreements renewed
after their initial term (i.e. in the Extension Period). Claimant alleges that, in a “but for” scenario,
it would have had a 75% chance to get all the Lease Agreements in the modernised Terminal 1
as an incumbent, had its relationship with PPL not been disturbed. The Tribunal here observes
that Claimant only obtained an extension of its lease for duty-free shops in Polish airports in 50%
—and not 75% — of the cases in which it was an incumbent. While Respondent states that it does
not consider an extension probable, at most it would assume a probability of 25% or 50% for
Claimant to prevail in a public tender for a future lease period. Respondent would then evaluate
the damages for a perte d’une chance to be respectively EUR 7 or 8 million.’

As stated in Lemire v. Ukraine,'*” the compensation for loss of chance “is normally calculated

as the hypothetical maximum loss, multiplied by the probability of the chance coming into
fruition”.

The Tribunal does not agree with Claimant’s assumption that the probability that BH Travel
would have had the Lease Agreements renewed was 75%. Indeed, the basis for this assumption,
i.e., that the Baltona Group had prevailed in 75% of the tenders for leases of duty-free shops in
the past, became irrelevant in the specific context of new leases in the modernised Terminal 1.

Compensation for a loss of chance should be in proportion to the probability of its occurrence, as
is also confirmed by Article 7.4.3 of the UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial
Contracts.'*?> A sufficient causal link between the loss and the breach is required. The harm must
be a direct consequence of the breach.

The Tribunal observes that in the “but for” scenario, Claimant was not an “incumbent” with a
competitive advantage over its competitors to obtain the new leases in the modernised
Terminal 1. Indeed, there was a 2-year and 10-month period between the termination of the Lease
Agreements (in both Terminals | and 2) in February 2012 and the time that the new leases for
the modernised Terminal | had to be allocated in 2015. In those 34.5 months BH Travel had
completely disappeared from Terminal 1 while its competitors HDS and Keraniss continued to
operate their duty-free shops in Terminal 2. These competitors would be the real incumbent
concessionaires. In other words, HDS and Keraniss — and not BH Travel — were the incumbents
with a high probability of securing the new leases in Terminal 1.

While it is true that in the “but for” scenario, the Lease Agreements in Terminal 2 would not have
been terminated, it is not enough to state that BH Travel’s limited presence in Terminal 2 would
have been sufficient to have increased its chances of securing new lease agreements in the
modernised Terminal 1. BH Travel had a limited presence in Terminal 2 and there were two other
“incumbents” in Terminal 2 (HDS and Keraniss). In addition, the breakdown in the relationship
between PPL and BH Travel makes it unlikely that the Lease Agreements for Terminal 2 would
have been renewed.

The Tribunal also observes that although tender proceedings seem not to be required, they were
followed for the conclusion of the Lease Agreements during the 2005 tender process “to ensure
transparency and competiveness”. It is reasonable to assume that such a process would also be
followed for the granting of the new leases in the modernised Terminal 1.

It is noted that the conditions for the 2005 tender process left some discretion to PPL to establish
and evaluate the required criteria (inter alia, store concept, brand equity, monthly rent) and to
select the actual tenderer. No indications have been submitted to suggest that PPL’s discretion in
selecting the potential tenderers and granting the concessions would not apply for the new leases
after the modernisation.

Considering that PPL had retained the discretion to invite companies to tender, to establish the
tender criteria, and to evaluate the submitted offers, it may be expected that BH Travel’s
competitors, which had continued substantial operations in Terminal 2, would have had an

‘325 International Institute for the Unification of Private Law, UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial
Contracts, 2010.

187

advantage above BH Travel (who in the “but for” scenario would have left Terminal 1 for nearly
three years and retained only a limited presence in Terminal 2).

930. Moreover, the case at stake does not concern a mere extension of the lease of the same premises,
but rather the creation of a completely new concession, with walk-through shops, greater
surfaces, different business models, and higher rent prices.'***

931. Inbrief, the loss ofa chance requires, in a “but for” scenario, a causal link between the non-breach
and the probability that a future event would have occurred if no breach had been committed.
The Tribunal fails to see the causal link between the termination of the Lease Agreements on
16 February 2012 — with compensation — and the granting of completely new lease agreements,
nearly three years later.

Adverse inferences

932. Claimant requests the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from Respondent’s breach of the
Tribunal’s orders to produce documents which could have provided more precise data regarding
its calculation of damages. However, with regard to Claimant’s calculation of its actual losses
(Operating Losses and One-Off Termination Costs), Claimant does not need data from
Respondent. Neither does Claimant need the data for the calculations of its loss of profits in the
remaining contract terms (the Base Period). Data from Respondent would only have been useful
for the evaluation of the loss of the chance to conclude lease agreements for the new shops in the
modernised Terminal | (the Extension Period), especially to allow the Tribunal to have insight
into the lease conditions and rent. However, as the Tribunal has rejected Claimant’s claims for
this “loss of chance”, there is no need to make these evaluations, and thus no need to determine
whether adverse inferences should be drawn.

3) Claimant’s indirect interest in BH Travel

933. As Respondent has noted (see para. 636 above), Claimant did not have a full 100% indirect
interest in BH Travel. According to Claimant, it had an indirect interest of 80.68% in BH Travel
at the time the Lease Agreements were terminated. However, as Mr. Ahuja has confirmed, by the
time of the hearing Flemingo’s indirect interest in BH Travel was only 68.34%.'°5

934. The Tribunal agrees with Claimant that post-breach changes in the ownership of Claimant’s
investment have to be ignored. Such changes have no bearing on the calculation of Claimant’s
losses as at that time. Claimant’s interest has to be assessed as on the Valuation Date as
determined by the Tribunal (see para. 904 above) and changes subsequent to that date are to be
ignored.'*”° Indeed, to take a prosaic and quite extreme example to illustrate this principle, the
owner of a car remains entitled to claim compensation for damages inflicted to the car, even if
he had already sold the car immediately after the accident. Therefore, the Tribunal accepts that
Claimant’s indirect interest in BH Travel at the time of the breach (the Valuation Date as

'325 According to Respondent, Mr Ahuja clarified that, due to the restructuring process of Flemingo Group (...)
Flemingo DutyFree owns roughly 85% of Flemingo International; 84.8%, to be precise. Flemingo
International owns 100% of Ashdod. Ashdod owns 80%-plus, 80.6% of Baltona, And Baltona owns 100% of
BH Travel. See Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 208, referring to Hearing Transcript (12 October
2015), 153:10-14.

188

determined by the Tribunal) is relevant and for the purpose of the present proceedings, retains
Claimant’s indirect interest of 80.68% in BH Travel to calculate Claimant’s damages.

935. Accordingly, the Tribunal is prepared to accept Claimant’s claim for actual loss of
EUR 1,070,370, being 80.68% of BH Travel’s total actual losses of EUR 1,326,690. Similarly,
Claimant may claim 80.68% of BH Travel’s lost profits, as quantified by the Tribunal in
paragraph 942 below.

4) Alleged changes to the amount claimed

936. In its Rejoinder, Respondent argues that Claimant had changed the amount of damages claimed
from its Statement of Claim to its Reply, noting that the amounts claimed in the Reply as Base
Period and Extension Period lost profits increased by nearly EUR 31 million.'3?’ Respondent
argues that the amount had been increased by generating a completely new amount of the claim.

937. Respondent submits that Claimant intentionally understated the amount of the claims in its
Statement of Claim, thereby limiting Respondent’s right to a fair defence.'***

938. The Tribunal has an obligation to ensure that each Party is treated with equality and provided
with “a reasonable opportunity of presenting its case” pursuant to Article 17 of the UNCITRAL
Rules. This must be done with a view to “conduct[ing] the proceedings so as to avoid unnecessary
delay and expense and to provide a fair and efficient process for resolving the parties’ dispute.”

939. The Tribunal is satisfied that Respondent has had a fair and reasonable opportunity to respond to
all elements of Claimant’s case, including the amount of damages set out in Claimant’s Reply.
Indeed, Respondent was able to address these damages claims both at the hearing, and in its
Post-Hearing Brief. Accordingly, no further consideration of this issue is required.

5) Interest

940. Claimant requests that the Tribunal grant it interest equal to a 6-month EURIBOR, increased by
2% for the period from the valuation date until the date of payment of the award.”

941. The Tribunal grants Claimant’s request, taking into account the fact that EURIBOR 6-month is
at present negative.

6) Quantification of damages

942. Taking the above into account, the Tribunal finds that the total amount of damages recoverable
by Claimant is EUR 17,902,790.

943. The Tribunal based its calculation on Claimant’s Scenario Al Calculation, since this calculation
most closely correlates with the “but for” scenario that the Tribunal has found to be applicable
and incorporates, to the largest extent, the factors that the Tribunal has held to be reasonable for
the purposes of the DCF calculation. In order to bring Claimant’s Al Scenario Calculation in line
with the Tribunal’s findings, the Tribunal made the following two adjustments to the spreadsheet:

'327 Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 334.
1328 Respondent’s Rejoinder, para. 339.
'329 Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 555-562.

189

Reducing the “Extension scenario probability” on the Front Page sheet to 0%

(i.e., on the Front Page sheet, row 21 was adjusted to 0); and

Adjusting the discount rate to 8% on the BH_AIl sheet (i.e., on the BH_All

sheet, row 321 was changed from 6.8% to 8%).

944. The result of these amendments is a calculation of EUR 17,902,790 for Claimant’s share (at
80.68%) of BH Travel’s losses.

945.

VII.

Claimant’s claim for its actual losses (EUR 1,070,370) was included within Claimant’s Scenario
Al Calculation (see row 59 on the Front Page sheet) and so this amount does not need to be

added.

COSTS OF ARBITRATION

946. The Treaty contains no provisions on the allocation of the costs of arbitration in the case of a
dispute between an Investor and a Contracting Party.

950. Claimant submits that numerous UNCITRAL tribunals have awarded the successful party all or

951.

a portion of the costs on the principle that the “loser pays”, and maintains that it should be the
1331

successful party in this case.
Claimant further submits that tribunals have ordered a party to pay the costs of arbitration where
the party engaged in misconduct or insufficiently cooperated with the proceedings thereby
unnecessarily raising the cost of arbitration.'*” Claimant argues that Respondent, inter alia,
engaged in “repeated obstructionist tactics” and raised frivolous and superfluous claims,
including unfounded jurisdictional objections and a “baseless defence on quantum”, which
resulted in significantly and unnecessarily increasing Claimant’s costs and complicating the

resolution of the dispute.'*?

952. Claimant argues that Respondent’s claim for costs should be dismissed in its entirety as it “is

aware of no facts that would warrant any apportionment of costs to Flemingo DutyFree”.!°*4

Claimant rejects Respondent’s claim that it behaved in a “misleading” way and committed
“misconduct” by requesting an extension to file the Post-Hearing Brief, noting in this regard that
the Tribunal found that the timing of its submission caused no prejudice to Respondent. Claimant
also rejects Respondent’s claim that it had a “strategy in its habitual litigants practice” calling it
“baseless and far-fetched”.!**

953. In light of the foregoing, Claimant requests that the Tribunal order Respondent to bear all the

costs incurred by Claimant in relation to this arbitration and, subject to readjustment, to include

any further costs that Claimant may incur in the future in relation to the arbitration.'*°

954. In addition, Claimant requests that the Tribunal award Claimant compound interest on its costs

proceedings” as baseless, noting that Respondent does not cite any legal authority to support its

claim. 5”

957. Respondent disputes Claimant’s assertion that if Claimant is the winning party, Respondent
should pay all the costs of the arbitration proceedings as a matter of right.'“! Rather, Respondent
maintains that tribunals often require the parties to bear their own costs irrespective of which
party succeeds.

958. Respondent submits that if it is the prevailing party, it should be awarded full compensation of
costs incurred following the principle of “the cost follows the event” as applied by multiple
tribunals.'** However, in the event that Respondent is not the successful party, Respondent
submits that the costs of the arbitration proceedings, including the cost of the Parties’
representation, should be apportioned between the two Parties taking into account the
circumstances of the case.’ Specifically, Respondent argues that Claimant engaged in
“misleading behaviour and conduct” including, inter alia, “submission of the Post-Hearing Brief
after the deadline” which should be penalised by the Tribunal. Respondent argues further that
Claimant initiated arbitration proceedings as a part of its “habitual litigants practice” of
simultaneously initiating dozens of proceedings against the same entity and should thus bear the
cost of its strategy.'4

959. Respondent contends that Claimant’s Cost Summary contains “a series of erroneous and
misleading arguments”. Respondent submits that it has never abandoned or changed any of its
arguments, nor did it engage in obstructionist behaviour. Respondent further submits that
Claimant’s argument that its costs were increased due to Respondent’s actions is “empty and
baseless” and Respondent cannot be held liable for exercising its right to defend itself.'*“°

960. Respondent argues that it in no way contributed to Claimant’s costs, and that Claimant’s
increased costs were largely due to its own fault. Respondent maintains that Claimant chose to
incur expert fees rather than use publicly available expert data or reports. Respondent further
maintains that Claimant’s legal fees are unreasonably high due to its employment of excessive
legal representation that was not necessary to bring and support its claim.'"”

961. Respondent argues that Claimant engaged in behaviour resulting in additional and unnecessary
costs to Respondent, for which Claimant should be held liable. Respondent maintains Claimant
made substantial changes to the calculation of quantum with each submission, and due to
Claimant’s “evasive and contrived” quantum analysis, it had to engage additional experts,
generating unnecessary costs. Respondent further maintains that Claimant referred to a new series

of facts in its Reply that had not been present in the Statement of Claim, requiring Respondent to
spend additional time and resources responding to the new arguments and evidence. Respondent
also submits that due to Claimant’s requests for an additional hearing day and extension of
deadline to submit its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent incurred additional and unnecessary costs
for which Claimant should be held liable. Respondent further submits that Claimant engaged
Respondent in obstructionist letter-writing campaigns that also created additional costs.'*“*

In light of the foregoing, Respondent requests that the Tribunal award it full compensation of the
costs incurred during the arbitral proceedings.

Respondent disputes the application of interest on the costs connected to this arbitration as
contended by Claimant. Respondent maintains that such a claim has a penal character and it is
contrary to the essence of compensation in arbitration proceedings.'*” Therefore, the Tribunal
should not award interest.'**°

2) Tribunal’s Analysis
Fixing the Costs of Arbitration Pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules
Article 38(a): the fees of the Tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator

In determining the amount of its fees, the Tribunal has taken account of Article 39(1) of the
UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant to which “[t]he fees and expenses of the arbitral tribunal shall be
reasonable in amount, taking into account the amount in dispute, the complexity of the subject
matter, the time spent by the arbitrators and any other relevant circumstances of the case”.

The fees of Dr. Wolfgang Kiihn amount to EUR 237,000.00. The fees of Mr. John M. Townsend
amount to EUR 178,800.00. The fees of Professor Hans van Houtte, the Presiding Arbitrator,
amount to EUR 213,345.00.

Article 38(b): the travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators
The combined travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators totals EUR 23,489.77.
Article 38(c): the cost of expert advice and other assistance required by the Tribunal

The cost of assistance required by the Tribunal includes the PCA’s fees and expenses for registry
services which amount to EUR 112,912.25. The cost of other assistance required by the Tribunal,
including costs of court reporting, interpretation, catering, courier services, hearing venue
services, office supplies and printing, support staff overtime (security, information technology),

namely: EUR 9,728.19 + PLN 16,035.61 (i.e., EUR 3,758.85),'**! which total EUR 13,487.04.

Article 38(e): The costs for legal representation of and assistance to the successful party claimed
during the proceedings and determined by the Tribunal to be reasonable

Claimant is the successful party in these proceedings. It has claimed during these proceedings
costs for legal representation and assistance in the amount of EUR 2,544,859.21. The Tribunal
views these costs as reasonable.

Article 38(f): Fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the
Secretary-General of the PCA

No such fees and expenses were claimed by the Parties.
Total costs of arbitration

In accordance with Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal fixes the costs of arbitration
at EUR 3,387,768.74.

Apportioning the Costs of Arbitration Pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules

Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that the costs of arbitration shall in principle be
borne by the unsuccessful party. It also grants the Tribunal discretion to apportion the costs
otherwise between the Parties if it considers a different apportionment reasonable taking into
consideration the circumstances of the case.

Article 40(2) provides that taking into account the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal is free
to determine which party shall bear the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in
Article 38(e).

In light of the fact that Claimant has prevailed only in part on its claims for damages, the Tribunal
considers that the Parties should bear the costs of arbitration enumerated under Article 38(a), (b),
and (c) in equal shares, that the Parties should bear their own “travel and other expenses of
witnesses” under Article 38(d), and that Respondent should bear 60% of Claimant's costs of legal
representation and assistance under Article 38(e). The Tribunal orders Respondent to bear 60%
of Claimant’s costs of legal representation and assistance under Article 38(e) in the amount of
EUR 1,526,916.00. The Tribunal does not consider an award of interests on costs to be warranted.

The Parties deposited a total of EUR 850,000.00, in equal shares to cover the fees and expenses
of the Tribunal and the PCA. The remaining balance on the deposit is EUR 20,577.51. This
amount shall be reimbursed to the Parties in equal shares.
