PROJECT AND DISPUTE

The KPC Contract

On 9 March 1982, CRA Limited and BP p.l.c. incorporated PT KPC, under the laws
of Indonesia (Exh. KPC 13 Deed of Establishment). They each owned half of the
shares.

On 8 April 1982, PT KPC entered into an agreement with a state-owned company by
the name of Peruskan Negara Tambang Batubura to conduct coal mining operations
for a duration of 30 years commencing on 1 January 1992 in Sangatta, East
Kalimantan, Regency of East Kutai' (the "KPC Contract," Exh. KPC 6 = Exh. BP/RT
5). The KPC Contract was the first coal agreement entered into by the Government
of Indonesia (the "GOI," hereinafter also referred to as the "Government") with
foreign investors (BP/RT Mem., { 27). It is governed by Indonesian law. BP p.l.c.
and CRA Limited (the parent companies of PT KPC at that time) are referred to as
the foreign investors in the Preamble of the KPC Contract.

On 19 February 1991, with the approval of the GOI, CRA Limited transferred its
shareholding in PT KPC to Sangatta.

On 16 December 1991, Peruskan Negara Tambang Batubura was liquidated and
substituted by another state-owned company, PT Tambang Batubura Bukit Asam
(Persero) (PTBA) (Exh. KPC 4, Exh. BP/RT 15-20).

This dispute arises in connection with an alleged obligation of PT KPC under Article
26 of the KPC Contract to offer PT KPC’s shares for sale. The first paragraph of Art.
26.1 reads as follows:

Indonesian provinces are subdivided into Regencies. The Claimant states that the Regency of East
Kutai came into existence in 2001 (C. CM., 4 96).

Participation and Promotion of National Interest

Subject to the provisions hereunder, Contractor [PT KPC] shall ensure
that its shares are offered either for sale or issue to the Government or
Indonesian nationals or Indonesian Companies controlled by
Indonesians (hereinafter called ‘the Indonesian Participant’) in each
year following the end of fourth full calendar year after commencement
of the Operating Period. (Exh. KPC 6 = Exh. BP/RT 5)

Accordingly, starting in the fifth year of the operating period, i.e., in 1996, PT KPC
was to offer a pre-determined percentage of its shares for sale to Indonesian
participants.
included in the following year’s offer process until a total of 51% of PT KPC’s shares

Any shares not sold as a result of the yearly process were to be

had been sold to Indonesian participants.

The parties to the KPC Contract agreed to arbitrate disputes in relation to the

Contract as follows:

23.1

23.2

Except for tax matters, which are subject to the jurisdiction of the
Majelis Pertimbangan Pajak (The Consultative Board for Taxes),
any dispute between the Parties hereto arising before or after
termination concerning anything related to this Agreement and
the application thereof, including contentions that a Party is in
default in the performance of its obligations, shall, unless settled
by mutual agreement, or by mutually satisfactory conciliation, be
referred for settlement by arbitration to the International Centre
for Settlement of Investment Disputes pursuant to the Convention
thereon which entered into force on October 14, 1966. The
provisions of Article 23.2.3 hereof shall apply mutatis mutandis to
any such arbitration.

If the services of the Centre are unavailable to the Parties, then
such unsettled dispute shall be referred for settlement to a Board
of Arbitration of three members, consisting of two arbitrators and
an umpire. Batubara and [PT KPC] shall each appoint one
arbitrator and the arbitrators so appointed shall appoint an
umpire. If the arbitrators appointed by the Parties shall be unable
to agree upon the umpire within thirty (30) days after appointment
of the second arbitrator, the umpire shall, upon request of either
Party hereto, be designated by the President of the International
Court of Justice. If for any reason an arbitrator or umpire shall fail
or be unable to act, his successor shall be appointed in the same
manner as the arbitrator or umpire whom he succeeds. The
umpire shall not be closely connected with, or have been in the
public service of, or be a national of Indonesia, Australia or the
United Kingdom and he shall be a person of recognised standing
in the international jurisprudence.

23.1.1 If within two (2) months after institution of a Board of
Arbitration proceeding hereunder by either Party, the
other Party shall fail to appoint an arbitrator by written
notice to the instituting Party, such instituting Party shall
have the right to apply to the President of the
International Court of Justice for the appointment of a
sole arbitrator having the same qualifications as those
required in the case of an umpire. In such event, the sole
arbitrator shall constitute the Board of Arbitration
hereunder with respect to such proceeding.

2.2
16.

23.2.2 Unless the Parties otherwise agree, the place of arbitration
shall be Geneva, Switzerland. The Board of Arbitration
shall determine its own rules of procedure and the place
of arbitration, and, in the case of a Board of Arbitration
constituted pursuant to Article 23.2 or 23.2.1, the
decision of the Board shall be made by majority vote of
the members or by the sole arbitrator as the case may
be. The decision of the Board of Arbitration shall be final
and binding on the Parties hereto, and the Parties shall
comply in good faith with the decision and award of the
Board. [...]

23.3 The provisions of this Article shall continue in force
notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement. (Exh. KPC 6 =
Exh. BP/RT 5)

The KPC Contract was amended on 27 June 1997 (Exh. KPC 5 — Amendment to
contract) and all the rights and obligations of PTBA were transferred to the GOI,
acting through its Minister of Mines and Energy, now the Minister of Energy and
Mineral Resources (hereinafter also referred to as "the Minister").

Origin of the present dispute

As of 1996 through to 2001, PT KPC was to sell its shares in order to comply with
Article 26 of the KPC Contract. The divestment process under Article 26 is at the
core of the present dispute. For the purposes of its determination on jurisdiction, the
Tribunal deems it necessary to state some of the main facts of the dispute. The
Tribunal will indicate when these facts are uncontroversial. However, most of the
facts alleged by the Parties are contentious. In its analysis of the jurisdictional
objections, the Tribunal will make the findings of fact necessary for its determination
on jurisdiction on the basis of the extensive evidence submitted by the Parties. By
making these findings of fact, the Tribunal does not, in any way, pass any judgment
on the merits of the case.

2.2.1 Early divestment process

The early divestment process covers the period between 1996, when PT KPC was
to make the first offer of shares, and 2001, when Claimant allegedly manifested its
interest in benefiting from the divestment. Since the early divestment process is not
at issue in the present case, it will thus suffice to describe it summarily. During the
first years, the obligation to offer shares was deferred until 1 April 1998. In 1998, PT
KPC offered 23% of its shares to three potential Indonesian participants (Exh.
BP/RT 41). Negotiations lasted several months and the period for acceptance of the
1998 offer lapsed, unaccepted, on 12 January 1999 (Exh. BP/RT 53).

20.

21.

22.

23.

In 1999, PT KPC was required by the KPC Contract to offer 30% of its shares for
sale. It made its offer on 19 November 1999 to 11 participants, including the
Claimant (Exh. BP/RT 65). The period for acceptance was extended and lapsed on
19 August 2000 without any of the offerees having accepted such offer.

In December 2000, PT KPC offered 37% of its shares to the Government. This offer
also lapsed unaccepted on 15 March 2001.

2.2.2 2001 divestment process

In 2001, after discussions with the Government, PT KPC agreed to offer 51% of its
shares subject to an agreement on the price.

According to the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents, PT KPC had discretion to decide to
whom it would sell its shares, subject to the Government's approval. The Claimant
disputes this allegation and argues that the Government had priority rights (C. CM.,
B 4 54-55).

The Claimant submits that from as early as 2000 the Minister of Energy and Mineral
Resources had promised that the Claimant would benefit from such divestment (see
Judgment of the Central Jakarta District Court of 8 March 2006 (Judgment of the
CJDC),? Exh. C-14, 9 24).

In a letter of 4 April 2001 (Exh. BP/RT 128 = Exh. C-80), the Minister of Energy and
Mineral Resources, Mr. Purnomo Yugsgiantro, referred to a meeting held the
previous day and stressed that the Government was not interested in acquiring
shares and that PT KPC was to take account of the “aspirations” of the local
government and people of East Kalimantan "in the context of the implementation
and spirit of regional autonomy:”

With reference to the outcome of the meeting between the Department of
Energy and Mineral Resources and the Directors of PT KPC on 3 April
2001, an agreement has been reached to resolve the PT KPC share
divestment issue in the best possible manner based on the spirit of good
faith to fulfill [sic] the requirements of Article 26 of the Coal Mining
Cooperation Agreement number J2/ Ji-DU/16/82 dated 8 April 1982.

With regard to this, and considering that the government through the
Finance Minister's letter number S-380/MK.017/2000 dated 26 July 2000
has stated that there is as yet no need for the government to purchase
PT KPC shares, we hope that the Board of Directors of PT KPC will

annotation to the effect that it was "/mJade in conformity with its original’ was issued on 27 March 2006
by the Deputy Clerk of the CUDC. For the sake of consistency, the Tribunal will refer to the date of 8

promptly offer and implement the share divestment in the first quarter of
2001 in the amount of 51% (fifty one percent) in accordance with the
terms of Article 26 of the Coal Agreement based on the principle of
‘business to business’ by taking into account the aspirations of the local
government of East Kalimantan and the people of East Kalimantan in the
context of the implementation and spirit of regional autonomy.

PT KPC answered on 9 April 2001. It requested that the Government agree that no
Indonesian participant benefited from priority rights (Exh. BP/RT 129).

The Director General of Geology and Mineral Resources, Mr. Wimpy S. Tjetjep,
replied on behalf of the Minister on 24 April 2001 (Exh. BP/RT 131). He stressed
that the definition of government under the KPC Contract included Provinces and
Agencies and, accordingly, the need to account for the local aspirations:

In accordance with Article 26 PKP2B No. J2/Ji.DU/16/82, the Contractor
must guarantee that the shares are offered to or issued to the
Government of Indonesia or its citizens or corporations owned by or
controlled by Indonesians.

The central government thorough [sic] the Minister of Finance pursuant to
letter No. S-380/MK/017/2000 dated 26 July 2000 has declared that they
are not yet interested in purchasing the PT Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC)
shares.

Since the definition of Government as specified in the contract includes
the Provincial and Regency Administrations, we draw to the attention of
PT KPC, that it should, in offering the shares, take into account the
aspirations of the local government and people of East Kalimantan, by
adhering to the principle of ‘business-to-business.’

Regarding the price of the shares offered, we wish that you remain at the

price basis as agreed upon for the 30% share offer, namely US$ 175

million in accordance with the minutes of meeting of 26 October 2000,

hence the price for the 51% share offer should be US$ 297 million. As

you have been informed, the agreement specified in the Minutes of

Meeting constitutes a step in the context of resolving the matter of the

percentage of the shares that should be divested by PT Kaltim Prima

Coal.
PT KPC and the Minister conducted negotiations regarding the price and the
divestment process from April 2001 to the beginning of 2002 (see inter alia Exhs.

BP/RT 137, 141, 142, 144, 147, 148, 149, 151, 152, 153, 156, 157, and 164).

Meanwhile, the GPEK initiated criminal proceedings against PT KPC in June 2001
(Exh. BP/RT 138). Subsequently, in July 2001, the GPEK commenced domestic
civil proceedings before the District Court of South Jakarta. Among other relief, it
sought to attach PT KPC’s shares and to prevent PT KPC from selling such shares
to third parties (C. CM, 453, p. 32).

On 19 December 2001, the GPEK through its Governor informed the Minister of
Energy and Mineral Resources that it intended to buy the shares for a price of USD

29.

30.

32.

453 million and requested that the Minister order PT KPC to immediately sell the
shares (Exh. BP/RT 158 = Exh. C-32, with translations that are not identical). The
Regent of East Timur appears to have taken the same action on 28 January 2002
(Exh. BP/RT 162). On 6 February 2002, the Governor reiterated its request to the
Minister (Exh. C-33).

The Secretary General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Djoko
Damorno, wrote to both the GPEK and the Regent of East Timur on 4 February
2002 (Exh. BP/RT 163) as follows:

As you are aware, with reference to the letter No. 1412/80/MEM.S/2001
dated 4 April 2001, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources has
requested KPC's Director to immediately offer and implement 51% share
divestment on the first quarter of 2001 in accordance with Article 26 of
Coal Agreement based on ‘business to business’ principle and taking into
consideration the aspiration of the Local Government and people of the
East Kalimantan in relation with implementation and spirit of regional
autonomy.

With regard to the mentioned above, we kindly ask your assistance to
comply to those who are interested in buying the KPC's share to submit
their official offer, along with the complete data concerning their financial
sources, work program and amount of share to be bought.

For your information, PT Batu Bara Borneo Batuah which has had
support and recommendation from Bupati Kutai Timur and DPRD
Kabupaten Kutai Timur has shown its interest to buy 51% of KPC's share
through the letter No. 007/B.4/I/2002 dated 28 January 2002.

Furthermore, with reference to the Agreement with KPC, 31 March 2002

is the final date to determine the price of 2001 share offer. It is expected

that the agreed price to be offered should have been reached by 31

March 2002 and immediately offered to the interested parties.
The Parties have offered different and partly confusing versions of the facts as of
March 2002. For present purposes, it will suffice for the Tribunal to set forth the
following factual elements based on its chronological analysis of the exhibits on
record.

From 4 through 6 March 2002, a meeting took place during which PT KPC agreed
that it would offer 51% of its shares to Indonesian participants for USD 419.22
million by no later than 31 March 2002. This agreement was referred to as the 2001
Offer Price Agreement (Exh. C-87 letter of the Secretary General enclosing the
minutes of the meeting produced as Exh. C-30 = Exh. BP/RT 167).

On 6 March 2002, the House of Representatives of the GPEK published in the
Jakarta Post, among other media, an open letter to PT KPC, Rio Tinto and BP. It
urged these companies to comply with their legal obligations (Exh. C-81). Following

33.

34.

35.

36.

this open letter, the Claimant asserts that it called a meeting on 7 March 2002 (CM,
B, 1.65).

On 7 March 2002, a meeting did indeed take place between the Minister, Mr.
Purnomo Yusgiantro, the Governor of East Kalimantan, the Regent of East Kutai,
the Secretary General of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Djoko
Darmono, the Director General of Geology and Mineral Resources of the
Department of Energy and Mineral Resources, Mr. Wimpy Tjetjep, the President
Director of PT KPC, and the President Director of BP Indonesia (Exh. C-86 = Exh.
BP/RT 169). It was agreed that the civil and criminal proceedings pending against
PT KPC before the District Court of South Jakarta would be withdrawn. It was further
agreed that, upon the withdrawal of these proceedings, the PT KPC divestment
would be promptly undertaken as agreed during the meeting of 4-6 March 2002.

Another meeting took place on 18 March 2002 between the representatives of the
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources (the Secretary General and the Director
General) and PT KPC (Exh. C-87= Exh. BP/RT 176, Minutes of the meeting dated
18 March 2002, which reiterated the points agreed upon during the meeting of 4-6
March 2002). The minutes mention that the divestment would be undertaken with
due consideration for “the aspirations of the people and the governments of East
Kalimantan Province and East Kutai regency towards participation in the divestment
process” (Exh. C-87= Exh. BP/RT 176, also under BP/RT 177).

Various subsequent meetings were held and correspondence was exchanged. In
particular, there were meetings between PT KPC and the Government regarding the
divestment process, the main issue being the role of PT KPC in the selection of the
buyers.

In a limited cabinet meeting chaired by the President of the Republic of Indonesia
on 30 July 2002, it was decided that 51% of the shares of PT KPC should be offered
to the GOI, out of which 31% would be allocated to the GPEK and the Regency of
East Kutai, and the remaining 20% would be kept by the GOI. These decisions
were recorded as follows (Exh. BP/RT 208 = Exh. C-7= Exh. KPC 70):

1. That 51% of shares of PT KPC be offered to the Government of
the Republic of Indonesia on 31 July 2002 at a price of US$
419,220,000.

2. Furthermore the said 51% of PT KPC's shares be allocated to the
Provincial Government/Kabupaten Government of Kutim in the
amount of 31% and the balance of 20% to the Government of the
Republic of Indonesia.

37.

38.

39.

3. Due Diligence will be conducted on all prospective buyers of
shares of PT KPC especially with respect to capacity and
resources of their funding.

4. The Government will give protection (indemnity) to PT KPC and
related parties against any civil claims in Indonesian District Courts
in relation to divestment process of PT KPC.

5. Furthermore such protection (indemnity) will be passed on to all

purchasers of the divested shares of PT KPC on a joint and

several basis.
On or around 31 July 2002, the Provincial House of Representatives of the Province
of East Kalimantan (Exh. BP/RT 214 = Exh. KPC 72) rejected the Government’s
decision to keep 20% of PT KPC’s divested shares. It stressed that 51% of the
shares “must be offered” to the GPEK and the Regency of East Kutai. By Decree of
1 August 2002 (Exh. BP/RT 215), the same body demanded to participate in the
purchase of the shares, sought to force the GOI not to take part, to stop all coal
shipping activities of PT KPC, and to supervise the management of PT KPC until
completion of the divestment process.

In spite of these developments, a few days later, on 5 August 2002, PT KPC and the
GOI entered into a Framework Agreement (Exh. BP/RT 222 = Exh. KPC 73)
whereby PT KPC offered 51% of the shares to the GOI. The Claimant contends that
the Government breached its duties by concluding such an agreement which it
considers contrary to national interests (C. CM., B 4 69).

Under the Framework Agreement, 51% of the shares were to be offered to the GOI,
the latter being entitled to assign its rights to more than one potential Indonesian
Participant. The Framework Agreement listed companies owned by the GPEK and
the Regency of East Kutai as potential assignees. More particularly, Article 3.1
provides for the following process to confirm the 2001 Offer and to allocate the
shares:

(a) The 2001 Offer was made by KPC to GOI on the Offer Date
and will be confirmed by KPC sending a letter in the form of the
Offer Terms (‘Offer Letter’) promptly after the date hereof.

(b) Without limiting the obligations of GOI under this Agreement
and within 30 days from the Offer Date, GOI shall be entitled, to
assign and transfer its rights to and interest in and in respect of
the 2001 Offer arising under the Offer Letter in part only to the
entities described below (each, an ‘Assignee’) in respect of
such number of Offer Shares as is described below, subject to
the requirements of the Offer Terms:

(i) to GOI or a State-Owned Enterprise involved in mining, in
each case as agreed in writing between GOI and KPC - a
number of Offer Shares being a Material Shareholding; and

40.

A.

(ii) to the Provincial Government of Kaltim, the Regency
Government of Kutim, or companies owned by the Provincial
Government of Kaltim or the Regency Government of Kutim
respectively — a number of Offer Shares to be determined in
each case by GOI but which, in aggregate, shall be a
Material Shareholding,

provided always that:

A) the aggregate percentage which GOI assigns and
transfers its rights and interest to under this Clause 3.1
(b) shall not exceed the total percentage of the Offer
Shares;

B) the assignment and transfer of the rights to and interest
in the 2001 Offer by GOI under this Clause 3.1 (b) may
be exercised in respect of any Offer Shares once only;

C) the Government's right to assign and transfer the rights to
and interest in the 2001 Offer in accordance with this
Clause 3.1 is strictly personal to GOI;

D) no single person or entity may give an Acceptance in
respect of the whole of the Offer Shares; and

a

the 2001 Offer shall not be capable of acceptance by any
person other than an Assignee.

LJ (Exh. BP/RT 222)

The Framework Agreement further provides that disputes between the parties to that
agreement or any third party beneficiary would be resolved in accordance with the
dispute settlement mechanism of the KPC Contract, which provides primarily for
ICSID arbitration:

14.1 Any dispute under this Agreement between the Parties, or any
Party and third party beneficiaries of rights under this Agreement
conferred by Clause 2.3 [recte 23], arising before or after
termination concerning anything related to this Agreement and the
application thereof, including contentions that a Party is in default,
shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures contained in
Article 23 of the Coal Agreement [the KPC Contract] which are
hereby adopted mutatis mutandis.

14.2 In the event of any dispute between the Parties (or any Party
and third party beneficiaries of rights under this Agreement
conferred by Clause 2.3) being referred for settlement in
accordance with the provisions of this Clause 14, the operation of
and processes under this Agreement (and, if necessary the Offer
Terms) shall be suspended until such time as the dispute has been
finally settled by agreement between the Parties (or any Party and
third party beneficiaries of rights under this Agreement conferred
by Clause 2.3) or resolved in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. (Art. 14, Exh. BP/RT 222)

The Framework Agreement was consequently amended on 28 August 2002 to
extend the period of assignment and notification to PT KPC from 30 days to 60 days
from the offer date (Exh. BP/RT 225 = Exh. KPC 108). Hence, the assignment was
to take place by 30 September 2002, with unconditional offers from the assignees
due by 31 October 2002 and payment before 31 January 2003. The due diligence

1

45.

was to be completed by 31 October 2002 (Letter from PT KPC of 29 August 2002,
Exh. BP/RT 226, see also the timetable attached to presentation document Exh.
BP/RT 228).

The minutes of a meeting held on 20 September 2002 mention that the GOI had
informed PT KPC of the names of the assignees on the same date (Exh. BP/RT
231, which minutes do not list the attendees).

A letter of 24 September 2002 from PT KPC to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources shows that the GOI's shortlisted candidates for the acquisition of the 20%
of PT KPC's shares going to the GOI were the two state-owned entities, PT
Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (Persero) and PT Aneka Tambang Tbk, and that PT
KPC agreed to provide them access to its data room (Exh. BP/RT 235). PT
Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (Persero) was the final assignee of the shares
allocated to the Government and the assignees of the 31% shares which were
allocated by the GOI to the Government of the Province of East Kalimantan were
Perusda Melati Bhakti Satya and Perusda Pertambangan dan Energi Kutai Timur,
as shown by the minutes of a limited coordination meeting held among Ministers on
31 October 2002 (Exh. BP/RT 239).

A second amendment to the Framework Agreement was made on 29 September
2002, again extending the time for the assignment of the GOl's right to buy PT
KPC's shares, this time until 28 October 2002:

The first paragraph of Clause 3.1 (b) of the Framework Agreement
(as has been amended by the First Amendment) shall be hereby
amended to read as follows:

‘Without limiting the obligations of GOI under this Agreement and

not later than 1700 Jakarta time on 28 October 2002, GOI shall be

entitled, to assign and transfer its rights to and interest in and in

respect of the 2001 Offer arising under the Offer Letter in part only

to the entities described below (each, an ‘Assignee’ in respect of

such number of Offer Shares as is described below, subject to the

requirements of the Offer Terms.’ (Exh. BP/RT 236 = Exh. KPC

109)
According to the BP/RT Respondents, the Government failed to assign its rights by
the agreed date of 28 October 2002 and the offer lapsed by 31 October 2002. PT
KPC informed the Government that the offer had expired on 31 October 2002 and
that the Perusda Melati Bhakti Satya and Perusda Pertambangan Dan Energy Kutai
Timur had not satisfied the due diligence criteria set out in the Framework
Agreement, which assignees of the PT KPC shares were required to meet (BP/RT

Mem., { 76).

On 18 November 2002, the GPEK and the East Kutai Regency Government wrote to
the President of Indonesia challenging the Framework Agreement and alleging that
it was unlawful and void by operation of law (Exh. BP/RT 250). Ten days later, the
GPEK filed an action to nullify the Framework Agreement before the Samarinda
District Court.

On 4 December 2002, the Saraminda District Court issued a "determination" by
which it nullified the Framework Agreement, among other reasons because it “has a
purpose which is against the law’ since “article 3.1 (b) contains limitations on the
government's authorities both central or regional, in performing their functions to
control land and water and natural sources” (Exh. BP/RT 252). It also held that the
agreement was against good morality and public order. By letter of 14 December
2002, the Department of Energy and Mineral Resources requested the Saraminda
District Court to reconsider such decision (Exh. BP/RT 253). By letter dated 17
December 2002, PT KPC, in turn, objected to the cancellation of the Framework
Agreement (Exh. BP/RT 254).

On 20 January 2003, PT KPC wrote to the Minister to explain that its offer under the
Framework Agreement had lapsed on 31 October 2002. It offered to proceed under
the provisions of Clause 3.1.(g), i.e., to offer shares as part of the 2001 process
(despite the expiry of such process) before steps were to be taken by PT KPC and
the GOI with respect to any 2002 offer. It also stated that, in addition to PTBA,
“[o]ther potential offerees, including representatives of the people and Governments
of Kaltim/Kutai, could also be considered subject to appropriate due diligence being
successfully carried out.” (Exh. BP/RT 256).

On 5 March 2003, PT KPC followed up by sending to the Ministry a “Draft
Agreement on Confirmation, Amendment and Restatement of the Framework
Agreement for the Implementation of KPC Shares Offer’ (Exh. BP/RT 268). The
draft provided for a completion date on 15 May 2003 and a divestment of 20% to the
GOl's nominee, PT Tambang Batubara Bukit Asam (Persero) and of 31% to
Perusda Melati Bhakti Satya and Perusda Pertambangan Dan Energy Kutai Timur.

At a meeting held on 10 March 2003 between the “East Kutai Regency
Government,” the “East Kutai Regional Peoples Representative Peoples Assembly,”
the “Alliance of the East Kalimantan People for Justice and Prosperity,” the “East
Kutai Youth Figures” and PT KPC, the following decisions were taken with respect to
the due diligence process to be carried out in view of the divestment:

51.

52.

53.

1. The divestment due diligence process will be undertaken by
both parties (purchaser and seller) in accordance with the Coal
Agreement [the KPC Agreement] and applicable regulations
and will be undertaken as soon as possible and will be
facilitated by the Government and PT. KPC.

2. If the time up to 31 March 2003 is not enough, it is suggested
that the due diligence process be extended for 3 months from
31 March 2003.

3. For implementation of the above matters, it is suggested that
the related parties (Governor, Head of the Kalimantan Province
Regional Peoples Representative Assembly, the Bupati, the
Head of the East Kutai Regional Peoples Representative
Assembly and the East Kalimantan Peoples Alliance for
Justice and Welfare, the shareholder of PT. KPC namely BP
and Rio Tinto, the Minister for Mining, the Minister for State
Owned Enterprises, the Minister of Home Affairs) have a
meeting in Jakarta as soon as possible, to be facilitated by the
Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs. (Exh. BP/RT 271)
This meeting was followed by another one held on 3 April 2003 between
representatives of the GOI and PT KPC. During that meeting, the Minister handed
out a memorandum entitled “Points of discussion on negotiation,” stating that the
Ministry had come to an agreement with the GPEK pursuant to which the latter

would withdraw its legal actions (Exh. BP/RT 273).

On 25 April 2003, Sangatta Holdings Limited, acting for the Rio Tinto group, sent a
notice of suspension of the Framework Agreement to the Minister, PT KPC and BP
International Limited (Exh. BP/RT 279). Following such notice, starting in June
2003, the parties entered into discussions about the termination of the Framework
Agreement (Exh. BP/RT 289). In that context, on 10 October 2003, PT KPC wrote
to the Minister to request the termination of the Framework Agreement (Exh. KPC
24, also in Exh. KPC 58). During that same month, according to PT KPC, the
Government and PT KPC agreed to terminate the Framework Agreement.
According to PT KPC, they preferred doing so “rather than to seek to formally
overturn the District Court ruling” (KPC Mem., {| 53).

2.2.3. Sale of the shares of PT KPC to Bumi and others
a) Sale to Bumi

Meanwhile PT Bumi Resources Tbk (“Bumi”), an Indonesian company, had
expressed an interest in acquiring a 100% interest in PT KPC (Exh. BP/RT 280 and
84). Bumi had already expressed an interest in February 2002 and featured
amongst the potential Indonesian Participants (Exh. BP/RT 165). Thus, between
April and June 2003, BP and Rio Tinto commenced negotiations with Bumi for the
sale of their entire interest in PT KPC (BP Mem., 481; Exh. BP/RT 288).

54.

55.

56.

57.

58.

59.

According to a notice sent by Rio Tinto to PT KPC on 6 August 2003, Bumi
purchased all the shares of Sangatta Holdings Limited and Kalimantan Coal Limited
for USD 500 million on 16 July 2003 (Exh. KPC 22). It thus became the owner of
the two holding companies that owned the shares of PT KPC and thus the sole
(indirect) shareholder of PT KPC.

BP and Rio Tinto contend that their involvement in the management and operations
of PT KPC ceased on 10 October 2003 (BP Mem., {| 84).

b) Sale to the East Kutai Regency

On 13 October 2003, the District Government of Kutai Timur (i.e. the East Kutai
Regency Government, C. CM., 4 35, p. 21) bought 18.6% of PT KPC’s shares from
Sangatta Holdings Limited and Kalimantan Coal Limited (now owned by Bumi) (Exh.
KPC 23). The share purchase was approved by the House of People’s
Representatives of Kutai Timur in a resolution of 30 October 2003 (Exh. KPC 25), by
the shareholders of PT KPC on 12 January 2004 (Exh. KPC 27), and by the
Government on 12 March 2004 (Exh. KPC 29).

On 10 June 2004, the Regency of East Kutai transferred the right to purchase the
shares so acquired to PT Kutai Timur Energi (Exh. KPC 32). Such transfer was
challenged by the Claimant before the State Administrative Court of Samarinda in
November 2004. The GPEK also brought the matter before the State Administrative
Court of Jakarta to challenge the legality of the Government’s approval of such
transfer. These proceedings were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

On 21 February 2005, PT Kutai Timur Energi agreed to transfer 13.6% of the
shareholding in PT KPC to Bumi because it was unable to pay for the shares. A
share purchase agreement was entered into on 25 August 2005.° It appears from
Bumi’s information to its shareholders of May 2006 (Exh. C-110) that such transfer
was approved by Bumi and by the Government in October 2005.

c) Sale to PT Sitrade Nusaglobus

On 10 March 2005, Sangatta Holdings Limited and Kalimantan Coal Limited sold a
further 32.4% of PT KPC’s shares to PT Sitrade Nusaglobus, an Indonesian
Participant. The sale was approved by the Government on 24 June 2005 (Exh. KPC.
43) and by the Investment Coordinating Board of the GOI on 15 August 2005 (Exh.

According to the notes to Bumi’s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year 2005 (point 4 quoted
by the Claimant in C. CM., A § 48, p. 27).

15

60.

61.

62.

63.

64.

KPC 44). It was further approved by Bumi. The shares so acquired by PT Sitrade
Nusaglobus were transferred to PT Sitrade Coal on 26 August 2005.

By letter dated 11 October 2005, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources
approved the share divestment and summarized the then shareholdings in PT KPC
(Exh. KPC 124). In a listing established by the Investment Coordinating Board on
17 October 2005 (Exh. KPC 125), PT Sitrade Coal does appear (with a USD
9,720,000.00 placement in equity), together with PT Kutai Timur Energi (USD
1,500,000 placement in equity), PT Sitrade Nusaglobus (USD 0 placement in
equity), PT Bumi Resources Tbk (USD 4,080,000.00 placement in equity), Sangatta
(USD 7,350,000 placement in equity) and Kalimantan Coal Limited (USD 7,350,000
placement in equity).

The Claimant challenges the validity and regularity of this transaction. It contends
that there is neither evidence of payment, nor an approval by the general meeting of
shareholders of Bumi (C. CM, A § 42, 4 48, p. 28). It also stresses that 90% of PT
Sitrade Coal is held by Bumi (C. CM, A § 48, p. 29).

d) Sale to Tata Power

On 30 March 2007, Tata Power (Mauritius) Limited purchased a further 30% of PT
KPC’s shares from Sangatta Holdings Limited and Kalimantan Coal Limited. The
Claimant considers this transaction irrelevant to the case (C. CM., A 46).

The Claimant views the current shareholding structure of PT KPC as follows (C.
CM., § 44): Kalimantan Coal Ltd and Sangatta each holding 50% of the shares of PT
KPC (each of them being 100% owned by PT Bumi Resources Tbk). The PT KPC
Respondents view it as follows (KPC Mem., { 48): Kalimantan Coal Ltd and
Sangatta each holding 9.5% of the shares of PT KPC (each of them being 100%
owned by PT Bumi Resources Tbk), PT Sitrade Coal, PT Kutai Timur Energi, PT
Bumi Resources Tbk, and Tata Power (Mauritius) Limited respectively holding
32.4%, 5%, 13.6% and 30% of the shares of PT KPC.

2.2.4 Proceedings before the Jakarta Courts

On 27 July 2005, the Claimant and its wholly owned subsidiary Perusahaan Daerah
(Perusda) Melati Bhakti Satya initiated civil proceedings before the Central Jakarta
District Court ("CJDC") against 14 defendants, including all of the Respondents in
this arbitration, as well as the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, the
Director General of Geology and Mineral Resources, and other government officials

16

65.

66.

67.

of Indonesia (the Secretary General of the Department of Energy and Mineral
Resources; the former Coordinating Minister for Economy; and the then
Coordinating Minister for Economy). It requested payment of USD 774 million as a
result of PT KPC’s failure to sell to it or its subsidiaries 51% of its shares. The claim
was brought on the ground of unlawful action (tort) pursuant to Article 1365 of the
Indonesian Civil Code (C. CM., A 7).

Some of the defendants, including PT KPC, Sangatta, and Kalimantan Coal Limited,
argued that the District Court lacked jurisdiction because Article 23 of the KPC
Contract provided that any dispute between the Government and PT KPC was to be
submitted to ICSID Arbitration (Judgment of the CUDC, Exh. C-14, p. 35). The rest
of the defendants, including Rio Tinto, BP p.l.c., Pacific Resources Investments
Limited and BP International Limited, relied on Article 23 of the KPC Contract as well
as Clause 14 of the Framework Agreement, that also refers to “arbitration/ICSID” to
support their objection of lack of jurisdiction. They argued that the “Plaintiffs are part
of the united Government of the Republic of Indonesia and is subordinate of the
Central Government,” which is bound by the KPC Contract (Judgment of the CJDC,
Exh. C-14, p. 40). They also argued that the plaintiffs lacked the right, capacity, or
authority to file a claim in relation to the KPC Contract or Framework Agreement, the
party to the KPC Contract being the Government and its representative the Minister,
not the GPEK. The Minister, the Director General and the other officials also relied
on Article 23 of the KPC Contract referring to “arbitration/ICSID” for the settlement of
disputes related to the KPC Contract to argue that the CJDC did not have
jurisdiction to examine and adjudicate the claims submitted to it. They further
argued that the administrative courts were not competent since they were acting as
state officials in the divestment process.

On 8 March 2006, the CDJC dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction on the basis
of Article 23 of the KPC Contract (Exh. C-14). It noted that PT KPC and the
Government had agreed that any dispute relating to the KPC Contract be submitted
to ICSID arbitration. It further observed that Article 1.8 of the KPC Contract included
“Provincial or District Authorities” as part of the definition of “Government,” and that
such expression included in turn the GPEK (Judgment of the CJDC, Exh. C-14,
p. 54).

The Claimant brought an appeal to the Supreme Court of Indonesia on 19 July 2006
(Exh. KPC 66 = Exh. BP/RT 317). In its petition, it quoted the letters exchanged with
ICSID in the course of the registration process and argued that the Respondents
were challenging ICSID jurisdiction before the Centre. It also requested the

17

68.

69.

attachment of the shares of Sangatta, Kalimantan Coal Limited, and of the assets of
Minister Yusgiantoro.

On 13 December 2007, the Supreme Court of Indonesia dismissed the appeal for
lack of jurisdiction, finding, inter alia, (i) that the rights of PT Tambang Batubara
Bukit Asam (Persero) were transferred on 7 October 1997 to the Government of the
Republic of Indonesia; (ii) that such Government subsequently became party to the
KPC Contract; and (iii) that on the basis of Article 23(1), any dispute arising from
such Contract shall be settled “through arbitration/ICSID.”

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIAL PHASE

On 5 April 2006, the Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration (hereinafter also
referred to as the “Request” or “RA”) with the International Centre for the Settlement
of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”), accompanied by 4 exhibits (Exh.
RA. C-1 to C-4). In the Request, the Claimant invoked the provisions of the KPC
Contract and sought the following relief:

As result of Respondents’ default in the performance of its (their)
obligations under KPC CONTRACT and also violation of Law on
Foreign Investment and Decisions of the Government of the
Republic of Indonesia, Claimant has to incur damages inter alia in
the form of loss of revenue/income from dividend which has been
or will be distributed by PT KALTIM PRIMA COAL, which should
have been received by Claimant, if Respondents perform or
complete the performance of PT KALTIM PRIMA COAL’s and RIO
TINTO’s and BP’s (being “Foreign Investors” under KPC
CONTRACT) obligation to divest 51% shares in PT KALTIM
PRIMA COAL and to comply with the provisions of Article 26 of
KPC CONTRACT in conjunction with the above mentioned
Decisions of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, as
follow:

(1) on the basis of data from Directorate of Coal, Directorate
General of Geology and Mineral Resources, tabulated below [...]
[Total of USD 144.18 million].

(2) on the basis of projection of PT KALTIM PRIMA COAL’s profit
after tax for year 2001 until year 2010, which was prepared by
Salomon Smith Barney, appraiser of PT KALTIM PRJMA COAL at
the time it submitted the price of PT KALTIM PRIMA COAL shares
to the Government of the Republic of Indonesia, as tabulated
below [...]

[Total USD 627.95 million]

If Respondents perform or complete the performance of PT
KALTIM PRIMA COAL’s and RIO TINTO’s and BP’s (being
"Foreign Investors" under KPC CONTRACT) obligation to divest

70.

71.

72.

51% shares in PT KALTIM PRIMA COAL and to comply with the
provisions of Article 26 of KPC CONTRACT in accordance with the
above mentioned Decisions of the Government of the Republic of
Indonesia, on which basis 31% shares in PT KALTIM PRIMA
COAL has been allocated to Claimant, therefore the damages of
Claimant shall at minimum be (US$ 144,180,000 + US$
627,950,000) X 31/51 = US$ 469,333,921.56 (four hundred sixty
nine million three hundred thirty three thousand nine hundred
twenty one United States Dollars and fifty six cents). Claimant seek
full compensation for such damages:

- in the amount of US$ 469,333,921.56 (four hundred sixty
nine million three hundred thirty three thousand nine
hundred twenty one United States Dollars and fifty six
cents);

- _ interest on such sums from May 2003 (taking into account
3-month period for due diligence and acceptance as of the
Decision of the Government of the Republic of Indonesia
dated 31 October 2002 [the Minutes of Limited
Coordination Meeting between Ministers [or Limited Inter-
Ministers Coordination Meeting] dated 31 October 2002
mentioned above], and another 3-month period for
completion as of the acceptance, both as regulated in
Article 26 of KPC CONTRACT) until the date of payment;
and

- costs of attorneys, consultants, the arbitration panel, and
such other losses and expenses as are legally allowable,
together with such further and additional relief as the
Arbitration Tribunal may deem appropriate. (RA, § 17)

On 10 April 2006, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID
Institution Rules”), acknowledged receipt of the Request and on 28 April 2006 it
transmitted copies thereof to the Respondents.

On 18 January 2007, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request for
Arbitration, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the “ICSID
Convention”). On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Institution Rule 7, the
Secretary-General notified the Parties of the registration of the Request and invited
them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.

The Parties agreed pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention that the
Tribunal would be constituted of three arbitrators, with each party appointing an
arbitrator, and the two party-appointed arbitrators subsequently designating the
president. On 30 January 2007, the Claimant appointed Mr. Michael Hwang, a
national of Singapore. On 17 February 2007, the Respondents appointed Prof.
Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of The Netherlands. The two party-appointed
arbitrators agreed to appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of
Switzerland, as the President of the Tribunal.

77.

On 12 April 2007, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of
the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration
Rules’), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointment
and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings
to have begun on that date. The Parties were informed by the same letter that Mrs.
Claudia Frutos-Peterson, ICSID Counsel, would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.
Subsequently, Mrs. Claudia Frutos-Peterson was replaced by Mr. Ucheora
Onwuamaegbu, ICSID Senior Counsel, as the Secretary to the Tribunal.

On 26 April 2007, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents raised jurisdictional objections and
made an application pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) to the effect that the
Arbitral Tribunal determine that the Request was manifestly without legal merit.

On 13 June 2007, the Tribunal held its first session in London (hereinafter referred
to as the "First Session"). At the outset of the session, the Parties expressed their
agreement that the Tribunal had been duly constituted (ICSID Arbitration Rule 6)
and stated that they had no objections in this respect. The Parties agreed that,
pursuant to Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, the proceedings would be conducted
in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force since 10 April 2006. It was
also decided that the language of the proceedings would be English and that the
place of arbitration would be Washington, D.C. The BP/Rio Tinto Respondents
withdrew their application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) at the hearing.
Accordingly, a timetable was agreed upon to deal with the objections to jurisdiction.
An audio recording of the session was later distributed to the Parties. Minutes were
drafted and signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and sent to
the Parties on 13 July 2007.

WRITTEN PHASE ON JURISDICTION

In accordance with the timetable agreed during the First Session, on 31 August
2007 the KPC Respondents submitted their Objections to Jurisdiction (KPC Mem.),
accompanied by 112 exhibits (Exh. KPC 1 to Exh. KPC 112) and legal authorities
(LA. KPC A to LA. KPC V).

On the same date, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents submitted their Memorial on
Jurisdiction (BP Mem.), accompanied by 319 exhibits (Exh. BP/RT 1 to Exh. BP/RT
319) and legal authorities (LA. BP/RT 320 to LA. BP/RT 326). A witness statement
by Mr. Stephen Creese, General Counsel of Rio Tinto Limited, was attached to the
Memorial.

20

81.

The Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 22 November 2007
accompanied by 98 exhibits (Exh. C-1 to C-98). No witness statements or expert
opinion were appended to it.

The KPC Respondents filed their Rebuttal to Claimant's Counter-Memorial ("KPC
Reply") and the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents their Rebuttal Submissions ("BP/RT
Reply") on 20 December 2007.

The Claimant filed a submission on Indonesian law ("C. Reply") on 17 January 2008
with Exhibits C-99 to C-116.

HEARING ON JURISDICTION

On 27 and 28 February 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in
Singapore. With the agreement of all involved, this location was chosen for reasons

POST-HEARING PERIOD

On 10 April 2008 the Parties submitted their Post Hearing Briefs, followed by their
statements of costs on 24 April 2008.

In a letter of 24 June 2008 to ICSID, Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh wrote that “in [his]
capacity acting as the Governor of, and therefore on behalf of the Government of
the Province of East Kalimantan as the Claimant hereby revoke the ICSID Case No.
ARB/07/03, as submitted by our legal counsel, P.D.D. Dermawan of DNC Advocates
at Work [...].”. He further requested that the “subject case [be] deleted from the
registration book and files of International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (‘ICSID’)” (the “Revocation Letter”). Attached to this letter was a second
letter entitled “Cancellation of Power of Attorney” in which the “Government of the
Province of East Kalimantan (‘East Kalimantan Government’) hereby cancels and
declares null and void all parts of the power of attorney from East Kalimantan
Government to PDD Dermawan, SH, ILM, Ibrahim Senen, SH, ILM, and M. Arie
Armand, SH, LL.M (jointly referred to as ‘Former Attorney-in-Fact’) dated 8 March
2006 in relation to the case ARB/07//03 registered at the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)” (the “Cancellation Letter’).

On 16 July 2008, ICSID requested the Claimant to confirm that the Revocation
Letter was a request pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, i.e., a request for the
discontinuance of the arbitration.

In a letter dated 17 July 2008 to ICSID, Mr. Dermawan contended that the letters
sent by Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh were invalid and had no legal effect. Attached to
Mr. Dermawan’s letter was the latter’s original Power of Attorney, a letter sent by
Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh to the House of People Representatives East Kalimantan
Province, as well as two newspaper articles regarding the expiration of the term of
Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh as Governor of East Kalimantan on 25 June 2008. Mr.
Dermawan then followed up on this letter on 25 July 2008 mainly disputing the
Official nature of the Revocation Letter and submitting selected provisions of the
Regulation of the Minister of Domestic Affairs Number 2 Year 2005 Regarding
Guidelines for Order of Official Documents within the Provincial Governments (the
“Minister Regulation 2/2005”).

In the meantime, on 18 July 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal invited Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh
to comment on Mr. Dermawan’s letter of 17 July 2008. In his reply of 31 July 2008,

93.

Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh presented his observations and admitted that he no longer
held the position of Governor of East Kalimantan.

On 4 August 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal invited the Respondents to present their
comments. Ten days later, the KPC Respondents accepted “the Government of the
Province of East Kalimantan’s request for discontinuance of this arbitration
proceeding contained in Claimant's 24 June 2008 letter of Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh,
Governor of the Province.”

The BP/Rio Tinto Respondents reacted on the same day and stated that they did
“not feel that it [was] appropriate for them to comment on the letter” as “[t]he issues
raised are internal issues of Indonesian law and domestic politics for those who
govern East Kalimantan.”

On 15 August 2008, Mr. Dermawan commented on the Respondents’ letters,
objecting to the arguments raised and the opinion submitted by the KPC
Respondents. Furthermore, Mr. Dermawan drew attention to the fact the
Government of the Province of East Kalimantan had not confirmed the Revocation
Letter as requested in the Tribunal’s letter of 16 July 2008.

On 28 August 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 noting the KPC
Respondents’ acceptance of the discontinuance pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule
44. The Tribunal invited the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents to state whether they
opposed the discontinuance of the arbitration.

On 3 September 2008, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents confirmed that they did not
object to the discontinuance of the proceedings pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule
44.

On 5 September 2008, the Tribunal received another letter from Mr. Dermawan with
eight attachments requesting the cancellation of Procedural Order No. 3, the
issuance of a decision on jurisdiction, and the joinder of the Regency of East Kutai
as a party to the arbitration. Among the attachments, the Tribunal received two
copies of a letter from the Regency of East Kutai to ICSID, both copies dated
29 August 2008. In their letter, the Vice Regent of East Kutai, Ir. H. Isran Noor, M.
Si, “confirmed that the result of the Meeting between Acting Governor of East
Kalimantan, Ir. Tarmizi A. Karim, MSc; Legal Counsel of the Government of East
Kalimantan and Legal Counsel of the Government of the Regency of East Kutai,
P.D.D. Dermawan and Acting Regent of East Kutai” was that

25

(i) the letter sent by Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh on 24 June 2008 regarding the
revocation of this arbitration could not be confirmed as it did not conform to
the applicable regulations;

(ii) “the Government of the Province of East Kalimantan still continues and is
applicant party, together with the Government of the Regency of East Kutai,
in ICSID arbitration case No. ARB/07/03, until there is definitive decision
from the elected Governor of East Kalimantan;”

(iii) all administrative matters “relating to the joint claim interests in the said
ICSID arbitration case” would be handled through the Government of the
Regency of East Kutai.

As a consequence, the Tribunal requested the Acting Governor of the Province of
East Kalimantan to confirm by 26 September 2008 whether the Claimant wished to
continue or discontinue the arbitration proceedings.

Following a reminder from the Tribunal, Mr. Dermawan informed the Tribunal on
10 October 2008 of various political developments, including the fact that a second
round of elections for Governor of the Province of East Kalimantan was to take
place in late October 2008. Pending such elections, the Tribunal decided to stay the
proceedings until 15 November 2008, when the Parties were requested to report on
the status.

On 18 November 2008, the Tribunal received an email dated 16 November 2008
from Mr. Dermawan with a status report, including 12 newspaper articles. The email
stated that a new Governor for the Province of East Kalimantan, Mr. Awang Farouk
Ishak, had been announced on 7 November 2008, and that his inauguration would
possibly take place in December 2008. The newspaper articles attached to the
email from Mr. Dermawan referred to the effects of the current market crisis on the
share prices of PT Bumi Resources Tbk. In the email, Mr. Dermawan also alleged
that “Bumi's debacle reveals (for the first time, in public news) who [Bakrie* really is]
and what kind of things [Bakrie can do with {in particular, the current}
government/administration], the ‘who and what’ we fight against, and the ‘who and
what’ BP and Rio Tinto know about and that is their main reason to 'sell' 100% of PT
KPC at USD 500 million to Bumi.”

Mr. Bakrie is the controlling shareholder of Bumi.

In a letter dated 21 November 2008, the Claimant's attorneys advised that they
“hereby declare [their] renunciation of the mandates granted to [them] under those
Powers of Attorney [from the GPEK].”

In a letter of the same date, the KPC Respondents requested the Tribunal to
discontinue the arbitration, as the “last communication [...] received from an
authorised representative of the Provincial Government of East Kalimantan” was
from Drs Yurnalis Ngayoh on 24 June 2008. In addition, neither Claimant nor Mr.
Dermawan “submitted any document to suggest that the Provincial Government did
not knowingly and willingly request discontinuance.” The KPC Respondents
requested discontinuance, “notwithstanding the Tribunal specifically requesting such
a communication from Drs Ngayoh's successor addressing the point.”

On 10 December 2008, the Tribunal was informed of exchanges of email
correspondence between ICSID and Mr. Dermawan, concerning (i) an email
received from Mr. Dermawan on 24 November 2008 entitled “amicus curiae”; and (ii)
a letter received from the newly elected Governor of the Province of East
Kalimantan dated 14 November 2008. In this letter, the Governor of the Province of
East Kalimantan confirmed that “1) The government of the Province of East
Kalimantan continues and is the requester, together with the government of the
District of East Kutai in the case of the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes Arbitrary [sic] Case, number ARB/07/03; 2) Mr. P.D.D.
Dermawan who has been officially appointed to represent the Provincial
Government of East Kalimantan in the court of law, is still representing the
Provincial Government of East Kalimantan in the case of the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes Arbitrary Case, number ARB/07/03.”

As a result, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit a confirmation that it did not
wish to discontinue the case once the newly elected Governor had taken office.

In a letter dated 9 January 2009, the Claimant confirmed that "the East Kalimantan
provincial government will continue to proceed with and act as petitioner jointly with
the government of East Kutai regency in ICSID Arbitration Case No. ARB/07/03"
and that "Mr. P.D.D. Dermawan and associates, whom [sic] were named the legal
counsel of the East Kalimantan provincial government are to remain the legal
counsel of the East Kalimantan provincial government in ICSID arbitration case No.
ARB/07/03."

On 23 January 2009, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents indicated that they were “not in
a position to challenge Mr. Dermawan’s position as legal representative for Claimant
in this arbitration” and that “all the previous jurisdictional and other objections of the
BP and Rio Tinto Respondents remain.”

On the same day, the KPC Respondents wrote that they did not “wish to burden
these proceedings at this time with further submissions, evidence or hearings on
issues concerning discontinuance pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rules 43 and 44.”
They added that “in the interests of simplicity, expediency and finality, KPC
Respondents request that the Tribunal lift the stay and promptly proceed to issue a
decision on jurisdiction.”

Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal decided to lift the stay of the proceedings. By
letter dated 27 January 2009, ICSID notified the Parties that in conformity with the
positions they had expressed in the recent correspondence, the Tribunal would
proceed to rule on its jurisdiction.

On 25 and 27 February 2009, whilst working on its determination on jurisdiction, the
Tribunal wrote to the Parties with reference to the Decision handed down by the
Supreme Court of Indonesia on 13 December 2007, inviting them to submit any
comments they may have on the said decision.

The KPC Respondents and the BT/Rio Tinto Respondents filed their respective
comments simultaneously by letters dated 20 March 2009. The Claimant filed no
further submission on the contents of the decision.

On 4 December 2009, ICSID wrote to the Parties that the proceedings were closed
as of such date.

The Tribunal has deliberated and considered the Parties’ pre-hearing submissions,
their oral arguments delivered in the course of the jurisdictional hearing, and their
post-hearing memorials and later submissions and correspondence. In the following
sections, it will first summarize the Parties’ positions, then analyse such positions,
and finally set forth its conclusion on jurisdiction.

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

RESPONDENTS’ POSITIONS

KPC Respondents

In their written and oral submissions, the KPC Respondents have put forward two
main contentions:

(i) The Claimant is not a Contracting State or a designated subdivision of a
Contracting State;

(ii) | The dispute is not a legal dispute, the Claimant not even being a party to the
KPC Contract.

First, according to the KPC Respondents, the Claimant is not a Contracting State. It
is not a designated subdivision of a Contracting State either. A province can be
considered as a subdivision of a State, but it must be designated as such (KPC
Mem., §{ 65-73, relying on Cable TV v. St Kitts and Nevis (ICSID Case No.
ARB/95/2)).

. Further, the KPC Respondents contend that this is an objective jurisdictional

requirement that cannot be bypassed (KPC Mem., § 79). There is no principle
allowing a tribunal to interpret Article 25 of the ICSID Convention broadly, liberally or
in favorem jurisdictionis (KPC Reply, § 10). Compliance with Article 25 is a question
of international law. Matters of consent must be resolved by applying international
law, not private law (KPC Mem., { 90, relying on CSOB v. Slovak Republic (ICSID
Case No. ARB/97/4) and Banro American Resources v. Democratic Republic of the
Congo (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/7)). Consent must be explicit (KPC Reply, {| 13).

The KPC Respondents submit that the Republic of Indonesia has not approved the
submission of GPEK’s claims to ICSID. On the contrary, according to the KPC
Respondents, the Republic of Indonesia has disapproved the submission to ICSID
(Exh. KPC 9). No approval was obtained from the “Regional House of Peoples
Representative for the East Kalimantan Province,” which refused to fund the
arbitration (Exh. KPC 1) (KPC Mem., 77; KPC Reply, 4] 57).

In addition, the KPC Respondents contend that the GPEK cannot step into the
shoes of the Government. The Government's authority has never been delegated to
GPEK (KPC Reply, 4 15). The GPEK is not generally authorised to act on behalf of
the Government. The Province’s authority derives from Law No. 32 of 2004 (LA.

29

114.

115.

116.

117.

KPC L) and it is subordinate and accountable to the Government (KPC Mem.., { 84).
Indonesia has not authorised the GPEK to act on its behalf (Exh. KPC 69).

Furthermore, the KPC Respondents submit that the GPEK cannot designate itself to
the Centre by submitting a claim to ICSID (KPC Reply, 4 55). It is not allowed to
represent the Government in matters of KPC’s share divestment, even as an offeree
of the 2001 Offer (KPC Reply, § 21). None of the documents invoked by the
Claimant support its position that it can put itself in the shoes of the Government
with regard to divestment or dispute resolution. According to the KPC Respondents,
if the GPEK had the shares, it would have become a shareholder, and nothing more
(KPC Reply, 33). The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has twice
confirmed in writing that the “GPEK has no authority to bring these specific
proceedings on behalf of the GOI” (KPC Reply, 35, Exh. KPC 10 and 69).

Second, the KPC Respondents contend that the dispute is a political one for which
no consent was given: “The crux of GPEK’s claims is that the GOI somehow
undertook to assign a portion of KPC shares to it, but then failed to carry out such
assignment’ (KPC Mem., § 95). In addition, there is no consent in writing since the
GPEK is not a party to the KPC contract.

The KPC Respondents submit that the GPEK is not a third party beneficiary to the
KPC Contract. Under Indonesian law, a third party cannot acquire rights under a
contract to which it is not a party (Article 1340 Civil Code), except when the contract
specifically benefits a third party who declares an intent to exercise the right before it
is revoked (Article 1317 Civil Code) (KPC Mem., § 104-105; KPC Reply, {| 36-40).
The GPEK was not expressly designated as a third party beneficiary (KPC Mem., {
106-109); it had no priority right (KPC Reply, {| 43); no assignment was ever made
(KPC Reply, {| 46); there was no more than a provisional allocation of shares (KPC
Reply, 4 46). The due diligence and the assignment process under the Framework
Agreement were never completed to the satisfaction of the Government or KPC
(KPC Reply, { 46).

The KPC Respondents contend that, in any event, the GPEK never actually
accepted the offer of the shares (Exh. KPC 10; KPC Reply, 4 46). On 31 July 2002,
the “Provincial House of Representatives of East Kalimantan Province” objected to
the provisional allocation of the shares decided by the Government (Exh. KPC 72).
The GPEK sought to nullify the Framework Agreement that set out the agreed
divestment process. The GPEK’s refusal is also mentioned in a letter of the

30

118.

119.

120.

1.2

121.

Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs of 31 December 2003 (KPC Mem., ¥ 111;
Exh. KPC 74).

According to the KPC Respondents, the GPEK is not a third party under the
Framework Agreement either (KPC Reply, 48-51); nor is it under the 2001 Offer
(ibidem, 4 52). Moreover, its alleged status as a third party beneficiary cannot in any
event establish jurisdiction (KPC Mem., 4 89; KPC Reply, § 47).

Further, the KPC Respondents contend that the decision of the CUDC of 8 March
2006 is neither inconsistent with a finding that the ICSID tribunal has no jurisdiction,
nor does it assist the GPEK in fulfilling the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention (KPC Mem., § 115). Rather, the dismissal of the GPEK’s claim by the
Supreme Court of Indonesia supports the argument that there is no basis for
jurisdiction by estoppel in the ICSID proceedings (letter of 20 March 2009).

On the basis of these arguments, the KPC Respondents request the following relief:

KPC Respondents respectfully reiterate their request that the Arbitral
Tribunal enter a decision:

(i) That all of the GPEK's claims in these proceedings are outside the
jurisdiction of ICSID and of this Tribunal;

(ii) | Ordering the GPEK to pay all of KPC Respondent's costs
associated with these proceedings, including the arbitrators' fees
and administrative costs fixed by ICSID, and the legal costs
(including attorneys’ fees) incurred by KPC Respondents, in an
amount to be quantified; and

(iii) | Ordering any other relief that the Tribunal sees fit.

(KPC PHM, 1189)

BP/Rio Tinto Respondents

In their written and oral submissions, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents have put
forward five main contentions:

(i) The Claimant is not a Contracting State or a designated subdivision of a
Contracting State;

(ii) | The Claimant is not a party to any ICSID consent agreement;

(iii) The Republic of Indonesia has never given its approval for the Claimant to
consent to ICSID arbitration;

31

122.

123.

124.

125.

(iv) The BP/Rio Tinto Respondents have not consented in writing to submit the
dispute with the Claimant to ICSID arbitration; and

(v) | The Claimant lacks standing to bring the present proceedings.

First, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents submit that the jurisdiction of the Centre
extends to a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State provided that
the latter has been designated to the Centre by the State (BP/RT Mem., § 103).
This requirement of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is further mentioned in ICSID
Institution Rule 2(1)(b). The GPEK is not a Contracting State. Indonesia is a unitary
State in which regional governments remain subordinate and accountable to the
central government (BP/RT Mem., | 107-108). Designation must be made in writing
and the GPEK was not designated to the Centre by the State. Indonesia has
confirmed that the GPEK was never authorized to file an arbitration (Exh. BP/RT
298). Relying on Cable TV v. St Kitts and Nevis and Amco v. Indonesia (ICSID
Case No. ARB/81/1) (designation of PT Wisma), the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents
submit that the designation requirement is mandatory (BP/RT Mem., {| 129).

Second, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents contend that the Claimant is not a party to
any ICSID consent agreement, be it the KPC Contract or the Framework
Agreement. Only the Government is party to the KPC Contract by the effect of the
assignments that took place in 1991 and 1997. The definition of government
contained in Article 1.1 of the KPC Contract has no bearing on who is a proper party
to the Contract since this question is determined conclusively by the 1997
amendment (BP/RT Mem., § 137). In 1997, the KPC Contract was formally assigned
to Indonesia, represented by the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources.

Further, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents submit that the Claimant is not an assignee
of shares in PT KPC. The conditions for an assignment were not met (BP/RT Reply,
q 46). The Government did not assign its shares on time to the Claimant (BP/RT
Reply, { 87).

Additionally, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents contend that the Claimant is not a third
party beneficiary of the ICSID consent agreement either. Under Article 1137 of the
Indonesian Civil Code, for a third party beneficiary right to arise, a promise made
must be in the interest of the third party and the latter must have declared its
intention to make use of such right, which the Claimant never did. On the contrary, it
sought to annul the Framework Agreement (BP/RT Reply, {| 86). In any event,
Article 23 of the KPC Contract does not confer the right to arbitrate disputes to any

32

126.

127.

128.

129.

third parties (BP/RT Mem., 4 140). Even if the Claimant had become a shareholder,
it would not have become a party to the KPC Contract. Even if it were a third party,
it would have only benefited from a right to purchase the shares, not from the entire
contract (BP/RT Reply, 83). Indeed, “/ndonesian law does not automatically make
a third party beneficiary a party to the contract generally’ (idem).

According to the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents, the Claimant cannot rely on the
Framework Agreement. This agreement does not confer any benefit on the
Claimant (BP/RT Mem., § 147). The only third party beneficiaries under Clause 14.1
of the Framework Agreement are the BP and Rio Tinto groups and parties related to
them (BP/RT Mem., § 151). Given that the Claimant sought to annul the Framework
Agreement, it is estopped from or has waived any right to rely on it (BP/RT Mem.,
153).

In addition, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents submit that the judgment of the CUDC
does not assist the Claimant either. The Court lacked jurisdiction not just because
of the arbitration clause, but also because the Claimant lacked standing to represent
the Government in relation to the KPC Contract (BP/RT Mem., § 156). The Supreme
Court of Indonesia confirmed the judgment of the CUDC and the submissions of the
BP/Rio Tinto Respondents by finding that the CJDC did not have jurisdiction over
the claim and that the Claimant did not have standing to benefit from the arbitration
agreement in the KPC Contract (BP/Rio Tinto’s letter of 20 March 2009).

Third, according to the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents, Article 25(3) of the ICSID
Convention states that consent by a subdivision or agency requires the approval of
the State unless the State otherwise notifies the Centre. This is an additional
requirement (BP/RT Mem., {| 160). Indonesia never agreed to the Claimant's
consenting to ICSID arbitration. Indonesia has confirmed this fact in a letter (Exh.
BP/RT 298).

Fourth, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents submit that they have never consented in
writing to submit any dispute with the Claimant to ICSID. They have consented to
ICSID arbitration in the Framework Agreement, which does not extend to third
parties. Consent to ICSID arbitration is not to be interpreted in favorem jurisdictionis
(BP/RT Mem., § 175-176). The BP/Rio Tinto Respondents have held a consistent
position since their demurrer in the 2005 Jakarta litigation. The 15 July 2002 press
release on which the Claimant relies does not establish the consent of the BP/Rio
Tinto Respondents. The 2001 Offer was subject to the requirements of the
Framework Agreement (BP/RT Reply, {| 62).

33

130.

131.

132.

133.

134.

Fifth and last, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents dispute the Claimant's standing in this
arbitration. They contend that the Claimant has no standing to bring the ICSID
proceedings, not being a third party beneficiary. They further argue that Governor
Suwarna and the Claimant's counsel have no authority to represent the Claimant.
They submit that Governor Suwarna has been suspended from his duties and
convicted on corruption charges. According to the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents, he is
likely to be dismissed as governor (BP/RT Reply, § 99). They thus question the
authority of Governor Suwarna to represent the Claimant and to empower
Claimant's counsel to continue the proceedings. They also question the funding of
the arbitration, which was not authorized by the Regional House of Representatives
of East Kalimantan (BP/RT Reply, {| 111).

On the basis of these arguments, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents request that the
Tribunal:

(1) declare that it has no jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims
filed by its Request for Arbitration dated 5 April 2006;

(2) order that the Claimant shall pay the BP/Rio Tinto
Respondents' legal and other costs of these proceedings;
and

(3) order any other remedy the Tribunal deems appropriate.
(BP/RT PHB, { 108)

CLAIMANT’S POSITION

First, relying on Amco v. Indonesia, the Claimant submits that the interpretation of
an agreement which refers to ICSID arbitration must not be too formalistic. It further
argues that the principle in favorem jurisdictionis applies to arbitration under the
ICSID Convention (C. CM., A® 4.56). An arbitration agreement should be construed
in good faith and “by taking into account the consequences of the commitments the
parties may be considered as having reasonably and legitimately envisaged’
(quoting CSOB v. Slovak Republic) (C. CM., A { 90).

According to the Claimant, whether the parties have expressed their common intent
within the meaning of the ICSID Convention is not governed by international law (C.
CM., A 459).

Second, in order to bring this dispute under the jurisdiction of the ICSID Tribunal, the

Claimant argues that it only needs to be either the representative or a “designate” of

The Claimant has divided its Counter-Memorial into section A: answers to KPC Respondents and
section B: answers to BP/Rio Tinto Respondents.

Indonesia (C. CM, A 66). It steps in the shoes of the Government by representing
the Republic of Indonesia as a Contracting State (C. CM., A § 62; C. Reply, 4 25).
Alternatively or cumulatively, as a constituent subdivision or agency of the Republic
of Indonesia designated to ICSID, it acts as a “designate” of the Republic of
Indonesia.

The Claimant also invokes the right of substitution allegedly provided in Article 2 of
Indonesian Law No. 5 of 1968 (C. CM., 4 63 ; C. Reply, § 26), which reads as
follows:

The Government has the authority to give consent that a dispute

regarding investment between the Republic of Indonesia and Nationals of

other States is settled in accordance with the [ ] Convention and to

represent the Republic of Indonesia in such dispute with right of

substitution. (Exh. C-64)
Further, the Claimant contends that the GOI and the Claimant are third party
beneficiaries under the KPC Contract, since both are identified as parts of the
“Government” under Article 1.8 of the Contract (C. CM., A 467). The benefits of the
Contract passed to the Claimant with all their inherent characteristics and attributes
(C. CM., A 67).

Also, the Claimant submits that no legal provision was adduced by the Respondents
to establish that a province is subordinate and accountable to the GOl, the
President, and relevant Ministers (C. CM., A § 84; B § 21). None of the provisions of
Law No 32/2004 suggests such interpretation (C. CM., ¢ 84; C. Reply, 4 44-45).
On the contrary, Article 42(1)(f) and (g) of Law No. 32/2004 authorizes the GPEK to
enter into international obligations. In addition, the Claimant is authorized to
represent the GOI in connection with the 2001 Offer, as it “does not bring this legal
claim on behalf of GOI as Authority or as Counterparty” (C. CM., A 4 85).

Third, the Claimant contends that, as an alternative or an additional element, the
Claimant is a constituent subdivision or agency designated to the Centre (C. CM., A
4 62). The Republic of Indonesia designated the GPEK as evidenced by the 30 July
2002 Minutes of Limited Cabinet Meeting, the 31 October 2002 Minutes of Limited
Coordination Meeting between Ministers, and the Framework Agreement (C. CM., A
467; C. Reply, 4 23).

According to the Claimant, designation need not be made in any particular form (C.
CM., A ¥ 70); it only needs to be communicated to the Centre in writing (C. CM., A
70). The designation was communicated in writing to the Centre when the Request
for Arbitration was submitted to the Centre (C. CM., A J 73). The Claimant argues

35

140.

141.

142.

143.

144,

that, as the GOI’s assignee, it has the capacity to act as representative of the GOI,
and hence to make such a communication to the Centre. The Claimant cannot
expect any cooperation or assistance from the GOI or the Minister “due to their
collusion with the Respondents” (C. CM., A ¥ 70). It further explains that “[flor the
sake of reasonableness and equity, and due to peculiarity (extreme circumstances,
due to collusion and corruption) of this case, Claimant begs for exemption to strict
application of such requirement’ (C. CM., A 4 73).

Fourth, the Claimant submits that it is party to the KPC Contract in its capacity as
third party in accordance with Articles 1340 and 1317 of the Indonesian Civil Code®
(C. CM., A J 104-105) with limited rights (i.e., only in respect of its benefits in Article
26 of the KPC Contract, and without the right to termination, C. Reply, § 27). By
becoming a party to the KPC Contract, the GPEK became a party to the “ICSID
consent agreement’ (C. CM., B 5; see also diagrams C. Reply, {J 11 and 17).

The Claimant contends that it “has been designated as offeree” and accepted the
offer. It has thus “become a party to KPC Contract entitled to enforce the rights
thereunder and under the 2001 Offer in accordance with the provisions therein.
Therefore, Claimant is party to the ICSID consent agreement contained therein” (C.
Reply, § 30). In the same vein, the Claimant submits that contrary to what the
Respondents assert, Clause 2.3 of the Framework Agreement is not a stipulation for
the benefit of third parties (C. Reply, {| 67).

Fifth, the Claimant submits that “by approving the 2001 Offer containing ICSID
arbitration agreement and then by passing on the 2001 Offer to Claimant, GOI has
given its approval for Claimant to consent to (such agreement for) ICSID arbitration”
(C. Reply, 4 31).

According to the Claimant, the GOI has not only designated the Claimant, it also
approved the submission of the Claimant's case to ICSID as evidenced in
Attachment A to the Framework Agreement which contains the ICSID clause (C.
CM., A ¥ 74).

In addition, the Government officials in the proceedings before the CJUDC argued
that the Claimants’ claims belonged to ICSID Arbitration (C. CM., A § 74). The
Government has thereby approved the Claimant's course of action.

The Claimant also asserts that the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents consented to the
arbitration: PT KPC is only “a conduit of BP/Rio Tinto Respondents, through which
BP/Rio Tinto Respondents made their investment,” any written consent given by PT
KPC “is deemed to be given by BP/Rio Tinto” (C. CM., B 45).

In addition, the Claimant contends that, in making the 2001 Offer and in agreeing to
any arbitration agreement in respect of the 2001 Offer, “KPC is agent for — and thus
acting for and on behalf of BP/Rio Tinto Respondents” (C. Reply, § 32).

Sixth, the Claimant puts forward that a legal dispute exists over the non-
performance of the KPC Contract (C. CM., A 4 91), specifically about the
enforcement and implementation of the following (C. CM., A 2) :

e Article 26 of the KPC Contract;

e The agreement on Shares Offering between PT KPC and the GOI as announced
in PT KPC’s press release of 15 July 2002 (Exh. C-6);

e The decision of the GOI recorded in the Minutes of Limited Cabinet Meeting of
30 July 2002 (Exh. C-7) to allocate 31% of KPC’s shares to inter alia the GPEK;

e The offer for sale of 51% PT KPC's shares made on 31 July 2002;

e The decision of the GOI as evidenced in the Minutes of Limited Coordination
Meeting of 31 October 2002 (Exh. C-9) to allocate 31% of the shares to the two
local companies, i.e., the Perusdas referred to in paragraph 43.

The Claimant also submits that there is a “real political” disagreement with the GOI
leading to court proceedings against certain officials (C. CM., A { 97).

Finally, the Claimant contends that it has standing and that the Governor of the
Province has authority to represent the Province and to appoint an attorney for its
representation (Article 25 of Law No. 32 of 2004 (LA. KPC L)). Consequently,
according to the Claimant, there is no requirement to obtain the approval of the
Regional House of Peoples Representatives (C. CM., A § 77; C. Reply, ¥ 50).

The Claimant also contends that the letter signed by Mr. Herlan Agussalim on behalf
of the Regional House of People’s Representatives of the Province of East
Kalimantan and stating the latter's refusal to fund the ICSID proceedings (Exh. KPC.
1) was in reality a personal letter from Mr. Agussalim to counsel for the KPC
Respondents (Baker Botts) that, as such, does not bind the GPEK (C. CM., A 477).

37

155.

The Claimant also questions the motivation of Mr. Agussalim, said to be influenced
in favour of Bumi (C. CM., A ¥ 88). Furthermore, the origin of the funding of the
proceedings is irrelevant (C. CM., A § 78).

In reliance on these arguments, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal uphold its
jurisdiction over all its claims.

ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTORY MATTERS

Before turning to the issues to be resolved, the Tribunal wishes to address certain
preliminary matters, namely the joinder of the Regency of East Kutai to the
proceedings (1.1), the relevance of previous decisions and awards (1.2), certain
uncontroversial matters (1.3), and the law applicable to jurisdiction (1.4).

Joinder of the Regency of East Kutai to the proceedings

In its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimant stated that “the Government of
the Regency of East Kutai wishes to join and participate in this [sic] proceedings
together with Claimant’. It attached a “Power of Attorney granted by the
Government of the Regency of East Kutai to counsel for Claimant for said purposes”
(C-CM., p. 85). On 5 September 2008, it formally requested the Arbitral Tribunal to
issue a “decision on the requests of the Government of the Regency of East Kutai to
join and participate in this arbitration proceeding under ICSID Arbitration Case No.
ARB/07/03.” Moreover, in his letter of 9 January 2009, the Governor of East
Kalimantan stated that “[t]he East Kalimantan provincial government will continue to
proceed with and act as petitioner jointly with the government of East Kutai regency
in ICSID Arbitration Case No. ARB/07/03.” The Claimant does not give any reasons
or point to any legal basis in support of its request for a joinder.

In a letter of 23 January 2009, the KPC Respondents submitted that “the Regency of
East Kutai is not now and had never been a party to these proceedings.”

The present proceedings were initiated by the GPEK. The Regency of East Kutai is
not named as a party in the Request for Arbitration. It does not appear in the
Minutes of the First Session and has not participated as a party in these
proceedings to this date.

160.

Unlike other arbitration regimes,” the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules
contain no provision on joinder of third parties to the proceedings. The question is
thus whether the Tribunal is empowered to order a joinder within its general
procedural powers pursuant to Article 44 of the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal can dispense with deciding here whether such power exists against the
will of certain of the existing parties to the proceedings. Even if it were to exist, it
would not be justified to exercise it under the present circumstances. Indeed, the
Tribunal considers that there are insufficient grounds to accept the joinder.

The GPEK does not substantiate its request for the joinder of the Regency of East
Kutai. Hence, it is difficult for the Tribunal to discern the legal basis on which such a
joinder might be admissible. In particular, there is no indication that the Regency
complies with the jurisdictional conditions imposed by Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention with respect to the expression and approval of consent, the qualification
as a State subdivision or agency or its designation to the Center by the Contracting
State. There is no indication either on the impact which the joinder would have on
the other Parties to these proceedings. In addition, neither the Claimant nor the
Regency have put forward any claim to which the Regency would be entitled and
which may affect the outcome of this case.

In light of these reasons, the Tribunal decides not to accept the joinder of the
Regency of East Kutai to the present proceedings.

The relevance of previous decisions or awards

In support of their positions, the Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards.
The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions.® At the same
time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of
international tribunals. It believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has
a duty to duly consider and possibly adopt solutions established in a series of
consistent cases. It also believes that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and
of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the
harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate

expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of the rule
of law.°

Uncontroversial matters

There is no dispute between the Parties as to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to
decide the jurisdictional challenges brought by the Respondents pursuant to Article
A1 of the ICSID Convention.

It is also undisputed that four conditions must be met for the Tribunal to uphold its
jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, namely (i) the dispute must be
between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a
Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another
Contracting State; (ii) the parties must have consented in writing to submit their
dispute to ICSID arbitration; (iii) the dispute must be a legal one; and (iv) the dispute
shall arise directly out of an investment. It is further common ground that any further
conditions set out in any other instrument which is the basis of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, in particular the KPC Contract, must also be fulfilled.

Law applicable to jurisdiction

While the Parties agree that jurisdiction is subject to the four conditions of Article 25
of the ICSID Convention, they diverge on the law governing the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. This is in particular so because their alleged consent is not based on a
treaty but on an arbitration agreement which is part of a contract governed by
national law, and more specifically by an alleged third party beneficiary right to such
arbitration agreement.

The Claimant argues that “[t]he question whether the parties’ [sic] have adequately
expressed their common will or intent, including their consent, to arbitration within
the meaning of the Convention is a question that is not governed by international
law’ (C. CM., § 59). On their side, the KPC Respondents reply that the “GPEK has
provided no authority for its contention that Article 25 is not to be construed in
accordance with international law. Its argument to that effect is without merit and
shall be disregarded. [...] This point is of particular importance regarding the
requirement of consent in writing’ (KPC Reply, ff 11 and 13). The BP/Rio Tinto
Respondents further contend that “[a]s the Convention is an international treaty
which determines the international law rights and obligations between Contracting

States, the question of whether the requirements for jurisdiction of the Centre have
been fulfilled is also a question of international law’ (BP/RT Mem., | 104).

ICSID tribunals usually hold that international law governs the determination of their
jurisdiction.’ The rationale underlying such position is that the requirements for
ICSID jurisdiction are contained in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, and that
international law, in particular the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT),
governs the assessment and interpretation of such treaty requirements. Therefore,
the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Respondents that international law applies to
the determination of the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

The fact that international law sets the requirements for ICSID jurisdiction does not
mean that other laws, specifically national laws, may never be considered when
reviewing whether the requirements set by international law are met. A review of
ICSID cases shows that tribunals do refer to national law, for instance to determine
whether the requirements of nationality'' or of the existence of an investment are
fulfilled."* In other words, depending on the circumstances, certain jurisdictional
requirements under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention may sometimes have to be
assessed taking into account national law. This may especially be true of the
requirement of consent when the agreement to arbitrate is contained in a contract
governed by national law.

determined in accordance with the law of the Contracting State in question (thus rendering such law
applicable), the Arbitral Tribunal held that this Article was a reflection of the rule according to which
“nationality is within the domestic jurisdiction of the State, which settles, by its own legislation, the rules
relating to the acquisition (and loss) of its nationality’ (thus alluding to the direct applicability of national
law for matters related to nationality).

accordance with the law of the host State (thus rendering the law of El Salvador applicable to the
determination of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction), the Arbitral Tribunal also applied directly the law of El
Salvador (without reasoning in terms of renvoi of the BIT), see for instance 4 262: “In accordance with
the Constitution and the Foreigners Law, no person who violated systematically the legal principles and
foundations that made its investment possible may claim the protection of that law. For a foreigner or
foreign company to benefit or be protected by Salvadoran legislation, it must comply with the condition
of respecting and obeying the laws whose protection it seeks. The foregoing principle is expressed in
the Investment Law itself, which imposes on investors the obligation to comply with the laws of the
Salvadoran State [...].”

As mentioned, the Claimant argues that the GPEK is a third party beneficiary of the
arbitration agreement contained in KPC Contract. The KPC Contract is governed by
Indonesian law. Under the principle of autonomy, the arbitration agreement
contained in a contract is not necessarily governed by the same law as the contract
itself. In this case, however, both Parties have pleaded the issue of third party
beneficiary rights under Indonesian law. This is particularly noteworthy with respect
to the Respondents, who had previously argued that international law applied to the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction (BP/RT Mem., {§ 139 et seq.; KCP Reply, 9 36 et seq.).

In sum, the Arbitral Tribunal concludes that international law applies to the
determination of its jurisdiction over this dispute and that, in assessing the
requirement of consent set by international law, it will take Indonesian law into
account because of the specifics of the consent involved here.

In this context, the Arbitral Tribunal also wishes to stress that, although it is not
bound by the judicial decisions of the Indonesian courts, it will give appropriate
consideration to their determinations and defer to their conclusions regarding
Indonesian law in appropriate circumstances. This said, it agrees with the
Respondents (BP/RT Mem., § 155; KPC Mem., § 114) that decisions of national
courts have no res judicata effect on international arbitral tribunals.

Furthermore, in connection with the standard for interpretation of the jurisdictional
requirements under the ICSID Convention, the Claimant argues that “the purpose of
the Convention is to apply the principle in favorem jurisdictionis, meaning that the
parties’ original intent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration shall be respected”
(C. CM., § 56). The KPC Respondents reply that no doctrine of “in favorem
jurisdictionis’ exists and that its application could lead to ignoring the jurisdictional
requirements of Article 25 (KPC Reply, { 10).

In line with AMCO Indonesia and others, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that
jurisdictional requirements shall be interpreted neither restrictively nor expansively,
but simply in a manner that is consistent with the common intent of the Parties. '®

Finally, the Tribunal stresses that, while it will obviously consider the Parties’
interpretation of the jurisdictional requirements set out in Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention, it is empowered to review on its own initiative whether a particular

jurisdictional requirement is met, as acknowledged by the KPC Respondents (KPC
PHM, § 72).

JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

This investment arbitration is unusual in the sense that the Respondent is not a
State but consists of several private parties. Conversely, the Claimant is not a
private party but a public entity which claims to have “stepped into the shoes of the
State” or to be considered a designated subdivision of that State. The Tribunal has
struggled with the question whether the Claimant could indeed bring a claim before
ICSID and, if so, how to examine the jurisdictional requirements.

Given that the main basis for jurisdiction is an arbitration clause contained in a
contract, the Tribunal finds that nothing in the ICSID Convention prevents a State or
its subdivisions or agencies from appearing as claimant in an arbitration based on a
contract. The question might receive a different response if the basis for jurisdiction
were an investment treaty which, in principle, reserves the right to bring an
arbitration to investors and does not grant substantive protections to States.

However, after long deliberations, a thorough assessment of all the arguments put
forward in this complex case, and a careful assessment of the evidence, the
Tribunal cannot but conclude that the Claimant’s case fails ab initio for the simple
reason that the Claimant has no right to bring this arbitration. The ICSID
Convention subjects jurisdiction to specific conditions which ICSID tribunals are not
empowered to ignore. The Claimant does not meet one of these specific conditions
and this turns out to be fatal to its case.

The fundamental question that the Tribunal is called to answer and will address now
is whether the Claimant can be considered a Contracting State because it
represents the Republic of Indonesia in this arbitration (2.1), or whether it is a
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by
that State (2.2.) as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In addition, the
Tribunal will address the general estoppel argument which the Parties have raised in
the course of the proceedings (3).

Does the Claimant represent the Republic of Indonesia in this arbitration?

The KPC Respondents contend that the GPEK is not a Contracting State (KPC
Mem., § 63). More specifically, they assert that the GOI has delegated no authority
to the GPEK, and that the latter does not "step into the former's shoes" on any other

43

178.

179.

180.

181.

182.

basis. With reference to the “right of substitution’ under Law No. 5 of 1968, the KPC
Respondents understand such right as being solely permissive and not prescriptive
(KPC PHM, { 18).

The BP/Rio Tinto Respondents submit that the GPEK is not a Contracting State, but
merely a “regional government with some autonomous power from the GOI’ (BP/RT
Mem., § 106). They argue that there is no legal doctrine or precedent where a third
party is entitled to “step into the shoes” of a Contracting State. They also interpret
Article 2 of Law No. 5 of 1968 as entitling the GOI, i.e., the executive power, to
represent and give its consent on behalf of the Republic of Indonesia, i.e., the State.

In reply, the Claimant asserts that it is “stepping into the shoes of GOI in
representing the Republic of Indonesia’ (C. CM., 4 62). It relies on Article 2 of Law
No. 5 of 1968, according to which the Republic of Indonesia may be represented by
an entity acting in its stead in ICSID proceedings, Indonesia being a Contracting
State to the ICSID Convention since 28 October 1968.

The Claimant primarily relies on Article 2 of Indonesian Law No. 5 of 1968 to show
its entitlement to “step into the shoes of GOI in representing the Republic of
Indonesia.” This Article provides that “/tjhe Government has the authority to give
consent that a dispute regarding investment between the Republic of Indonesia and
Nationals of other States is settled in accordance with the said Convention and to
represent the Republic of Indonesia in such dispute with right of substitution.” (Exh.
Cl. CM 64). Article 2 of the “Elucidation on Law No. 5 of 1968” clarifies the scope of
this provision by noting that “[alccording to Article 25 paragraph (1) and Article 36
paragraph (2) of the Convention all disputes must first have the consent of the
parties in dispute before being brought before the Arbitral Tribunal. This article
determines that the Government shall have the authority to render such consent in
addition to representing the Republic of Indonesia in such dispute with the right of
substitution if necessary’ (Exh. BP/RT 327).

Moreover, the preamble to the “Elucidation on Law No. 5 of 1968” explains that
“[alithough the Convention has become applicable to a country, however, it is not
necessarily an obligation for a country to resolve disputes in accordance with the
Convention. Since the absolute requirement for disputes to be resolved based on
the Convention shall be the consent of the parties in dispute.” (Exh. BP/RT 327)

In the Tribunal's view, Article 2 of Law No. 5 of 1968 does not create any entitlement
to “step into the shoes of GOI in representing the Republic of Indonesia.” This

44

183.

184.

185.

2.2

186.

article deals with two different issues. The first issue is consent. Acknowledging the
importance of consent by the State for agreeing to ICSID arbitration, Article 2
reserves the power to give such consent to the GOI. Consequently, only the GOI
can validly consent to ICSID arbitration on behalf of the Republic of Indonesia.

The second issue is representation. Article 2 also grants the GOI the power to
represent the Republic of Indonesia before ICSID tribunals in cases of investment
disputes with a national of another Contracting State. In this event, the GOI has the
“right of substitution” which must be understood as the right to nominate or
designate a third party to assume such representation. This is not the case here.
As will be analyzed later, the GOI expressly indicated that it had never authorized
such representation in the present case (see § 199 below).

The Claimant also relies on other documents, i.e., the KPC press release dated 15
July 2002, the minutes of the 30 July 2002 meeting, the 2001 Offer, the Framework
Agreement, and the minutes of the 31 October 2002 meeting (see 4] 194 and 195
below). The Tribunal cannot see how these documents support the Claimant's
position.

Therefore, the Claimant cannot be held to have a right to represent the Republic of
Indonesia before an ICSID Tribunal.

Is the Claimant a designated constituent subdivision of the Republic of
Indonesia?

The BP/Rio Tinto Respondents argue that “[a]s a subdivision or agency, the
Claimant must be designated by a Contracting State to ICSID before it can have
standing to appear before ICSID” (BP/RT Mem., § 110). They contend that the
Republic of Indonesia has made no designation, which is confirmed by the public list
of constituent subdivisions or agencies which have been designated to ICSID by the
Contracting States and by the Republic of Indonesia itself (Exh. BP/RT 298). They
stress that the Request for Arbitration contains no statement to the effect that the
GPEK has been designated when Rule 2(1)(b) of the ICSID Institution Rules so
requires. They add that the GPEK was at best an assignee of shares in PT KPC.
(which they deny) and that an assignment does not amount to a designation,
because a designation must be notified to ICSID by the State. They equally submit
that the Judgment of the CJDC (or “any judgment of the Indonesian courts on its
own,” BP/RT PHB, § 46) does not amount to a designation, because it was not
notified to ICSID by the Government. Rather, there is evidence to the contrary from
the latter (Exh. BP/RT 298; Exh. KPC 10; Exh. BP/RT 313, p.49, 9 11, CB2, p. 49;

45

187.

188.

189.

190.

Exh. BP/RT 318, Section |, §] 10-11). Further, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents
contend that the State’s consent is required twice, that is for designation and for
approval, as shown by the travaux préparatoires to the ICSID Convention (Exh.
BP/RT 325, p. 335, ¢{] 609-610).

The KPC Respondents similarly argue that “[jJurisdiction in respect of a constituent
subdivision, such as the GPEK, is ‘only available from ICSID if the entity has been
specifically designated as a constituent subdivision by the GOI’ (KPC Mem., { 67).
They contend that the GOI has not designated the GPEK as a constituent
subdivision for the purposes of Article 25. They further submit that the Judgment of
the CJDC does not amount to a designation because the designation must be made
by the Contracting State to ICSID with a clear intent to this effect.

In contrast, the Claimant argues that designation of a constituent subdivision to the
Centre need not be made in any particular form (except in writing) and that “a State
may designate a constituent subdivision at any time, provided such designation
exists on the day a request for arbitration is made to the Centre [...]” (C. CM., § 70).
It contends that the requirement of Article 25(1) is fulfilled as the GPEK “steps into
the shoes” of the GOI with respect to the 2001 Offer and the GOI designates the
Claimant “to receive the benefits of, and to deal with all aspects of, that 2001 Offer’
(C. CM., § 89). It further argues that “[d]esignation of Claimant as offeree (of the
2001 Offer) by GOI also constitutes designation of Claimant by GOI to ICSID being
the arbitration forum that the parties have consented to in writing to adjudicate any
disputes and any exercise of any available remedial right under KPC Contract’ (C.
Reply, 4 27). It finally submits that “GO/’s designation of Claimant and Government
of East Kutai as parties to benefit from such Offer and ICSID Arbitration Clause was
first announced by KPC on 15 July 2002, and then officially decided by GOI on 30
July 2002” (C. Rejoinder, p.13).

As a basis for designation, the Claimant refers to the decision of the GOI to
designate the Claimant as one of the assignees in respect of the 2001 Offer as
evidenced by the minutes of the limited cabinet meeting of 30 July 2002 and the
minutes of the limited coordination meeting between Ministers of 31 October 2002
(arguing that this amounts to designation by legislation, C. CM., A { 70) as well as to
the Framework Agreement (arguing that this amounts to designation by an
investment agreement, C. CM, A. | 67, 70).

Pursuant to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the jurisdiction of the Centre
covers disputes “between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision [...] of

46

191.

192.

193.

a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another
Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the
Centre.”

The history of the Convention shows that the term “constituent subdivisions” covers
a fair range of subdivisions including municipalities, local government bodies in
unitary states, semi-autonomous dependencies, provinces or federated States in
non-unitary States and the local government bodies in such subdivisions.'* In this
case, it is not disputed that East Kalimantan is a province of the Republic of
Indonesia. Consequently, the Tribunal finds no obstacle to declare that East
Kalimantan qualifies as a subdivision of a Contracting State. The question is
whether it is a “designated” subdivision as required by Article 25 of the Convention.

Before examining the existence of a designation, it is necessary to specify what form
the designation must take. ICSID’s public list of designations made by Contracting
States, specifically the footnote appearing at the end, show that designations can be
made ad hoc and need not appear on the list (“[ald hoc designations and
notifications made by Contracting States pursuant to Articles 25(1) and 25(3) are
excluded from this listing.”) In fact, commentators generally consider that
designations are not subject to any formal requirement as long as they are made to
the Centre. Christoph Schreuer stresses that “[i]t has been argued that where there
is a clear intention to designate, it does not matter how and through whom the

communication reaches the Centre.”'®

In other words, the form and channel of
communication do not matter, provided that the intention to designate is clearly

established.

The designation requirement in Article 25(1) must be read in conjunction with ICSID
Institution Rule 2(1)(b), which provides that “[t]he request [for arbitration] shall state
if one of the parties is a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State,
that it has been designated to the Centre by that State pursuant to Article 25(1) of
the Convention.” Consequently, the designation requirement may in particular be
deemed fulfilled when a document that emanates from the State is filed with the
request for arbitration and shows the State’s intent to name a specific entity as a
constituent subdivision or agency for the purposes of Article 25(1).

The minutes relied upon by the Claimant do not create a sufficient basis for
designation, as they do not show the State’s intent to designate. The minutes dated
30 July 2002 (Exh. BP/RT 239) merely mention the allocation of PT KPC shares
without referring to the designation of the GPEK by the Republic of Indonesia.
Similarly, the minutes of 31 October 2002 (Exh. BP/RT 239) refer to discussions
related to the divestment of shares, without manifesting an intent of the Republic of
Indonesia to designate the GPEK.

The wording of the Framework Agreement, upon which the GPEK also relies, comes
somewhat closer to meeting the designation requirement, although it is still
insufficient. Clause 14.1 of that agreement only concerns disputes “under this
Agreement between the Parties, or any Party and third party beneficiaries of rights
under this Agreement conferred by Clause 2.3’ (i.e., “Indemnified Parties” as defined
in Clause 1.1, which do not include the GPEK). As to Clause 13 of Attachment A to
the Framework Agreement (which appears to be the model offer letter referred to in
Clause 3.1(a) of the Framework Agreement), its legal status is unclear.

In its Request for Arbitration, the Claimant quotes an extract of the judgment of the
CJDC dated 8 March 2006, a full version of which is annexed to the Request. It
quotes in particular the following passage of the judgment:

PLAINTIFFS [the GPEK and the Provincial Company Melati Bhakti
Satya] are part of the united Government of the Republic of
Indonesia and is [sic] the subordinate of the Central Government.'®
At the close of the hearing, the Tribunal invited the Parties to address in their post-

hearing brief whether this judgment might be interpreted as an implied designation. '”

The Claimant has not advanced any convincing argument advocating that the
language quoted above constitutes a designation conveyed to the Centre with the
Request for Arbitration. To reach this conclusion, the judgment would have to
manifest an intent to designate the GPEK as a constituent subdivision for purposes
of Article 25. The Tribunal is unable to construe this excerpt as showing such an
intent to designate the GPEK on the part of the Republic of Indonesia. It thus
agrees with the observation of the KPC Respondents that “[t]he judgment contains
no clear statement of designation” (KPC PHM, { 79).

RAp. 4.

The Tribunal had expressly drawn the parties’ attention to this possibility at the close of the hearing:
“Assume that an argument were to be made that the judgment that is issued by an organ of the State
of the Republic of Indonesia could constitute some kind of an implied or not implied designation of a
constituent agency, because of the conclusion that the judgment reaches, and/or an approval of the
consent to ICSID of the constituent body. Here again, what would your position be on this
assumption?” (Tr., p.142, |.6-14)

In addition, the letters of 10 August 2006 (Exh. BP/RT 298) and 21 August 2007
(Exh. KPC 10) contradict the thesis of a designation of the GPEK as a constituent
subdivision. The letter of 10 August 2006 states that “[t]he Government of Indonesia
[...] has never issued any order or authorization in any form whatsoever to the East
Kalimantan Provincial Administration in connection with the PKP2B of PT KPC
including to file a petition based on the PKP2B to the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes’ and that “the East Kalimantan Provincial
Administration has no authority whatsoever with respect to the PT. KPC Divestment
based on the PKP2B.” The letter of 21 August 2007 confirms these facts by stating
that “[t]he Provincial Government of East Kalimantan shall therefore have no
capacity/qualification/authority and legal standing whatsoever to file any claim in
relation to PKP2B PT KPC before the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID) and elsewhere.”

In conclusion, the Tribunal considers that the State of Indonesia has not validly
designated the GPEK as a constituent subdivision to the Centre. On the contrary, it
has clearly denied the GPEK’s authority to act as a party in this ICSID arbitration.

The Tribunal considers that the lack of a valid designation is a bar to its jurisdiction
under the ICSID Convention. While holding so, the Tribunal is mindful of Aaron
Broches’ view that “[flailure of a formal designation should [...] not by itself defeat
jurisdiction if the entity concerned is proved or conceded to be a constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State’ (BP/RT Reply, §] 34). With Christoph
Schreuer, the Tribunal considers, however, that Broches’ view “goes too far” and
that designation cannot be dispensed with altogether."® Accepting jurisdiction in the
absence of designation by the State would not be in line with the ICSID Convention,
which expressly constrained the possibility for constituent subdivisions to submit to
ICSID arbitration within specified limits.

The Tribunal finds further support in Cable Television v. St. Kitts and Nevis, which
held that designation is a condition to jurisdiction, whether a constituent subdivision
is in the position of a claimant or that of a respondent (Exh. BP/RT 323, 2.28):

[I]t is evident from Article 25 (1) that ICSID has no jurisdiction
in matters brought by or against an entity other than a
contracting state unless the entity has been designated to
ICSID by the contracting state as a constituent subdivision or
agency of the contracting state.

ESTOPPEL

Both sides raise estoppel defenses. On the one hand, the BP/Rio Tinto
Respondents argue that the GPEK is estopped from asserting any right under the
Framework Agreement as it sought to annul the Agreement. On the other hand, the
Claimant submits that the Respondents are estopped from raising lack of jurisdiction
because of the position they took in the proceedings before the Indonesian courts.
The Tribunal will deal with this latter defence first. Indeed, the Respondents'
defense only becomes relevant if the Claimant's estoppel argument were to
succeed.

The BP/Rio Tinto Respondents submit that they are not estopped from raising lack
of jurisdiction in the present proceedings. First, they assert that their argument
before the CJDC was that (i) the GPEK lacked standing and capacity to act
independently of the GOI when seeking to enforce obligations under the KPC
Contract, and that (ii) the CUDC lacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the
parties to the KPC Contract had agreed that disputes should be resolved through
arbitration. Second, they contend that their declarations before the CJDC did not
fulfil the basic conditions of estoppel, namely that (i) these declarations were not
clear and unambiguous, (ii) they were not voluntary and unconditional, and (iii) there
had been no detrimental reliance by the Claimant on any such declaration. The
BP/RT Respondents submit that SGS v. Pakistan illustrates the caution of ICSID
tribunals in applying the concept of estoppel to limit the “strict legal rights of the
parties” (BP/RT PHB, § 28). Third, they argue that if the general estoppel argument
were to be recognized, it should also prevent the Claimant from bringing the current
ICSID proceedings, since the latter had previously taken the view that it was not
bound by the arbitration agreement contained in the KPC Contract or the
Framework Agreement (Exh. BP/RT 315).

. The BP/Rio Tinto Respondents also contend that, if it were admitted, the estoppel

argument would not satisfy the consent requirement and/or the requirements of
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. More specifically, estoppel cannot supply
consent to arbitration, as was illustrated by the decision of the Commercial Court
(England and Wales) in the case of The Republic of Kazakhstan v. Istil Group (Exh.
BP/RT 340). Further, estoppel does not supply any of the other requirements set
out in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

In their letter of 20 March 2009, the BP/Rio Tinto Respondents argue that the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Indonesia of 13 December 2007 is entirely

50

207.

208.

209.

210.

consistent with their oral and written submissions, as well as with the findings of the
CJDC, both courts having confirmed that all contractual disputes must be settled by
arbitration, to the exclusion of any other forum including the Indonesian courts.

The KPC Respondents rely on the decisions of an ICSID tribunal in Pan American
Energy v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/13) (LA. KPC DD) and of the
ICJ in Temple of Preah Vihear (Cambodia v. Thailand) (LA. KPC EE) to submit that
estoppel is subject to the following requirements: a clear statement of fact by one
party (which is voluntary, unconditional and authorized) and reliance in good faith by
another party on such statement to that party’s detriment or to the advantage of the
first party. They argue that these requirements are not met in the present case.
First, they have taken no inconsistent positions as they have argued before the
CJDC and the Supreme Court of Indonesia that the GOI was the correct party to
bring a claim to ICSID, and the GPEK was an integral part of the latter without
standing of its own. They maintain that the subject matter of this arbitration falls
within the scope of Article 23 of the KPC Contract, but that the GPEK is not the right
party to bring a claim pursuant to that arbitration agreement. The CJDC’s judgment
is said to be consistent with this position, as it found that “any dispute arising out of
the CCOW must be submitted to ICSID and that GPEK is bound by the arbitration
clause in the CCOW ‘as part of the United Government” (KPC PHM, § 65). With
respect to the second requirement of estoppel, the KPC Respondents submit that
the GPEK has suffered no detriment by relying on their statements, especially since
it would have further recourse to the CJDC and the administrative courts, in the
event that the Arbitral Tribunal denied its jurisdiction.

The KPC Respondents further contend that estoppel cannot supply jurisdiction as
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention imposes objective requirements, as was held in
the ICSID case Siag v. Egypt (LA. KPC N).

In their letter of 20 March 2009, the KPC Respondents add that the decision of the
Supreme Court of Indonesia validates their position that there is no estoppel in the
present case. In particular, they submit that their arguments before the CJUDC and
the Supreme Court of Indonesia are consistent with the objections to jurisdiction
made in the present proceedings.

The Claimant argues that the Respondents invoked Article 23 of the KPC Contract
to challenge the CJDC’s jurisdiction. It submits that no issue of third-party
stipulation arose in the CUDC proceedings and that, consequently, the Claimant is
not estopped from invoking such stipulation in the present proceedings. The

214.

Claimant further argues that the Respondents’ challenge of the CJDC’s jurisdiction
on the basis of the ICSID arbitration clause prevents them from now challenging
ICSID jurisdiction.

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that the BP/Rio Tinto and KPC Respondents both refer
to the writings of Derek Bowett on the notion of estoppel before international
tribunals"? (Exh. BP/RT 335 = LA. KPC KK). Bowett circumscribes estoppel as
follows: “[t]he rule of estoppel operates so as to preclude a party from denying the
truth of a statement of fact made previously by that party to another whereby that
other has acted to his detriment or the party making the statement has secured
some benefit.” He then articulates the following test: (i) the statement of fact must
be clear and unambiguous; (ii) the statement of fact must be made voluntarily,
unconditionally, and must be authorized; (iii) there must be reliance in good faith
upon the statement, either to the detriment of the party relying on the statement or to
the advantage of the party making the statement.

The Arbitral Tribunal understands such test as reflecting the current state of
international law. It refers, in particular, to lan Brownlie’s seminal treatise (LA. KPC
MM)*° and to Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada (NAFTA/UNCITRAL)
(LA. KPC Ju).?"

The burden of showing that the test is met lies upon the Claimant. In the Tribunal's
view, the Claimant has not met this burden. While the Respondents’ statements
before the municipal courts appear to have been made voluntarily, they are not
entirely clear and unambiguous.

Some of the Respondents’ statements before the Indonesian courts could indeed be
read as an affirmation of ICSID's jurisdiction over this dispute (in particular Exh.
BP/RT 316, p. 129, p. 145 and pp. 147-148). Others, however, mean that, while
ICSID arbitration is provided for in the KPC Contract, the Claimant is not entitled to
resort to it, e.g. “[...] in the event that Plaintiffs have legal capacity to file the claim, in
fact, they do not have one, the claim must be filed through Arbitration pursuant to

111: “In international law, it has been stated that the essentials of estoppel are (1) a statement of fact
which is clear and unambiguous; (2) this statement must be voluntary, unconditional, and authorized;
and (3) there must be reliance in good faith upon the statement either to the detriment of the party so
relying on the statement or to the advantage of the party making the statement.”

Article 23.1 of PKP2B [...]” (Exh. BP/RT 316, p.125). In other words, while the first
condition of the test is met, the second one is not.

Turning to the third requirement, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has given no
indication on the damage caused by its reliance on the Respondents’ alleged
conduct (or the advantage incurred for the Respondents by such conduct). Under
these circumstances, it is difficult to admit that the Claimant has met its burden of
proof with respect to the third requirement for estoppel. This is especially so as the
KPC Contract contains an alternative dispute resolution mechanism for the event
that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction.”*

Finally, the Tribunal adds that even if its conclusion on estoppel had been different,
a valid estoppel defense would not have done away with the requirement of
designation of a subdivision under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, such
requirement is an objective one that is not subject to the parties’ disposition and
cannot be waived.”*

In view of the conclusion just reached which confirms the outcome of the analysis of
the jurisdictional requirements and leads to a finding of lack of jurisdiction, the
Tribunal will dispense with reviewing the Respondents’ defense of estoppel.

CONCLUSION

On the basis of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the
requirements for jurisdiction set by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention are not met
and that it lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute.

This said, the Tribunal is mindful that this legal outcome will disappoint the
expectations which the Claimant had placed in ICSID. It is aware that the Province
and its people, present through numerous representatives at the hearing, have
sought means of addressing their dispute for a number of years now without
success. The arguments and submissions of the Respondents in the local courts,
even if they did not meet the stringent test of estoppel, may have led the Claimant to
set its hopes on ICSID, only to discover that ICSID in effect lacked jurisdiction. The
Tribunal has no hesitation in stating that this is indeed an unfortunate situation. At

Article 23.2 KPC Contract: “[i]f the services of the Centre are unavailable to the Parties, then such
unsettled dispute shall be referred for settlement to a Board of Arbitration of three members [...]” [Exh.
KPC 6].

the same time, it must add that the ICSID Convention subjects jurisdiction to specific
conditions which ICSID tribunals are not empowered to ignore in view of any
possible arguments as to the equities of the case. Finally, it notes that, if the
Claimant still intends to pursue its claims, the KPC Contract provides for an
alternative dispute settlement mechanism.

5. Costs

220. In view of the considerations set forth in paragraph 219 above, and in the exercise
of its discretion in matters of costs, the Tribunal deems it just and reasonable that
the ICSID costs be shared equally between the Parties, it being specified that the
costs have been kept unusually low by the Tribunal to account for the special
circumstances of this case.

221. For the same reasons, the Tribunal further determines that each Party bear its own
legal fees and other costs. This latter determination appears particularly justified
considering that the Claimant’s counsel by its own account acted entirely pro bono.

Vv. DECISION

On the basis of the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal issues the following decision:
1. The request to join the Regency of East Kutai to these proceedings is denied;
2. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the present dispute;

3. The costs, fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Centre shall be borne
equally by the Claimant, on the one hand, and the Respondents, on the other
hand;

4. Each Party shall bear its own legal fees and other costs incurred by it in
connection with this arbitration.
