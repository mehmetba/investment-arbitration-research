Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 6 of 265

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”), on the basis of the Energy Charter
Treaty, which entered into force on 16 April 1998 for the Netherlands and the Kingdom
of Spain (the “ECT”), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October
1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimants are NextEra Energy Global Holdings B.V. (“NextEra Global’), and
NextEra Energy Spain Holdings B.V. (“NextEra Spain”), both limited liability
companies incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (besloten vennootschap met

beperkte aansprakelijkheid), (together, “Claimants”).
The Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or “Respondent”).

Claimants and Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 12 March 2019, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and
Quantum Principles. That Decision constitutes an integral part of this Award and it is
hereby incorporated as Annex A. The Procedural History of this arbitration leading up to
the rendering of the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles is
summarized at Section II of that Decision.! A summary of the procedural steps thereafter

follows below.

In the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles, the Tribunal ruled:

' In addition, it is noted that on 11 March 2019, the Respondent filed an application seeking leave to introduce an
additional legal authority to the record, namely, RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European
Infrastructure Two Lux S.d.r.l v. Kingdom of Spain, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Responsibility and
Principles of Quantum, 30 November 2018 (“RREEF Decision”). Claimants filed a response also on 11 March
2019, opposing the application. The Tribunal dismissed the application by its letter of 12 March 2019.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 7 of 265

“The Tribunal decides:
(i) That it has jurisdiction over this dispute.

(ii) That Respondent did not comply with its obligation under Article
10(1) of the ECT to provide fair and equitable treatment in that it
failed to protect Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

(iti)That Claimants are entitled to damages based on a return on the
capitalized value of their assets as of 30 June 2016 on the basis of
the WACC of the Termosol Plants plus a premium of 200bps,
together with pre-judgment interest on the basis of 5-year Spanish
sovereign bonds as at the date of the Award, compounded monthly.

(iv) That Claimants are to recalculate their damages claim of EUR
398.4 million in the light of a premium of WACC plus 200 bps and
advise the Tribunal and Respondent of this recalculated amount
within 10 days of the receipt of this Decision.

(v) That Claimants are entitled to post-judgment interest from the date
of the Award on the basis of 5-year Spanish sovereign bonds as at
the date of the Award, compounded monthly, until payment.”

7. On 19 March 2019, Respondent filed an application asking that its quantum experts be

“allowed by the Arbitral Tribunal to revise the calculations requested in the Tribunal's

decision, paragraph 682.”

8. On 21 March 2019, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties noting: “[t]he Decision [...]
provided that the Claimants’ recalculation be forwarded to the Respondent and the
Tribunal. If on receipt of the Claimants’ recalculated damages the Respondent discovers
that there has been an error in calculation then it is free to draw that to the Tribunal’s

attention.”

9. Thereafter, on 21 March 2019, Claimants submitted the calculation requested at
paragraphs 680 and 682(iv) of the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum

Principles, and made submissions concerning the interest rate.

2 Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum, 12 March 2019, 682. See also, id., 4{ 680.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 8 of 265

On 5 April 2019, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no observations to
Claimants’ recalculations of its damages claim of 21 March 2019, and that it did not find

it appropriate to revisit the decision on the interest rate at that stage.

Following an invitation from the Tribunal, on 11 April 2019 Claimants submitted an
updated Statement of Costs. On 16 April 2019, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it
did not intend to file an updated Statement of Costs.

The proceeding was closed on 9 May 2019.

DAMAGES

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The Parties’ submissions concerning quantum issues were summarized at Section VIII(A)

of the Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles.

Following issuance of the above referenced Decision, in their letter of 21 March 2019,
Claimants (i) submitted that the Tribunal had already heard the Parties’ arguments on
quantum and determined the applicable quantum principles, with the only issue
remaining being an arithmetical reduction of 100 bps from the premium above the
WACC> (ii) confirmed that “Claimants’ damages figure ‘based on a return on the
capitalized value of their assets [EUR 720.6 million] as of 30 June 2016 on the basis of
the WACC of the Termosol Plants plus a premium of 200 bps’ is EUR 290.6 million
(excluding interest) as of 30 June 2016;”* and (iii) opposed any attempt by Respondent to
reopen quantum matters pertaining to the alternative but-for scenario.5 As to the
quantification of interest, Claimants observed that Spain’s central bank publishes the
Spanish sovereign bond rates daily, and asked that the Tribunal “specify the figure of the
intended applicable rate directly in the Award so that there can be no ambiguity on

6

enforcement. Claimants also requested that a precise interest rate be specified in

3 Cl. Letter, 21 March 2019, p. 1.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 9 of 265

connection with the interest awarded on legal costs, and referred to the Parties’ prior

submissions on the matter.”

In its communication of 5 April 2019, Respondent stated that “it ha[d] no observations
on the mathematical calculations of the Claimants’ recalculation of their damages claim
communicated [...] in the Claimants’ letter of 21 March 2019.8 As to quantification of
interest, Respondent submitted that the Tribunal had already decided that the interest rate
“will be based on 5-year Spanish sovereign bonds at the date of the Award, compounded
monthly” and that it was not appropriate to revisit the Tribunal’s decision on the interest

rate at this stage.”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

(ql) Damages

As pointed out above, in its Decision of 12 March 2019, the Tribunal left open the precise
quantification of damages in light of its conclusions on the principles applicable to that
quantification, and it invited Claimants to recalculate their damages claim in light of the
Tribunal’s Decision that damages should be calculated on the basis of a premium of
WACC plus 200bps.

As noted, Claimants responded on 21 March 2019 indicating that the recalculated amount
was EUR 290.6 million, which had already been anticipated by its expert Compass
Lexecon in its Second Report. Respondent raised no question about the accuracy of this
recalculation. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts the amount of EUR 290.6 million as the

accurate calculation of the damages in this case.

(2) Interest

The Tribunal also recalls that in its Decision of 12 March 2019 it concluded that both pre-

judgment and post-judgment interest were to be awarded on the basis of 5-year Spanish

7 Cl. Letter, 21 March 2019, p. 4 (citing Cl. Costs, § 1, Cl. Mem. Merits, (fj 305-311, Cl. Reply Merits, §{| 602-604
and 606 (4) and (5); Resp. Costs, § 9, Resp. C-Mem. Merits, {896-900 and 901(d), Resp. Rej. Merits, {| 1238 and
1240 (d).)

sovereign bonds as at the date of the Award, compounded monthly. At the time of
making the Decision the 5-year sovereign bond rate was 0.234%. However, if interest
were determined on the basis of 5-year sovereign bonds as of the date of this Award, that
amount would be essentially zero which is the last rate published by Spain’s Central
Bank (Banco de Espaiia) on the date of the Award.'° Since an award of zero interest is
not consistent with the conclusion of the Tribunal (Decision, {| 671) that an award of
interest was appropriate in this case, the Tribunal has decided to award interest at the rate
of 0.234%, the rate for 5-year sovereign bonds at the date of the Decision. Prejudgment
interest is thus to be awarded at this rate from the date of valuation, 30 June 2016, to the
date of this Award. Post-judgment interest is to be awarded at this rate from the date of

this Award until payment.

seek by way of cost recovery)!"

 

 

 

 

 

23. For the purposes of ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2), Claimants submit that their costs were
“reasonably incurred’ because (i) they are consistent with the amounts deemed
reasonable in prior ICSID cases; (ii) they are commensurate with the size, duration and
complexity of this proceeding; (iii) the pleadings were extensive; (iv) Claimants have

tried to reduce the length of the proceeding; and (v) Claimants have had to incur in more

costs than Respondent.!>

(2) — Respondent’s Position

24. — In its Statement of Costs dated 28 September 2018, the Respondent asks:

“As requested in Paragraph 901 d) of the Counter-Memorial on the Merits
and in Paragraph 1240 d) of Rejoinder on the Merits, the Kingdom of
Spain respectfully asks the Arbitral Tribunal to order the Claimants to pay
all costs and expenses arising from this arbitration, including the ISCID
[sic] administrative expenses, the arbitrators’ fees and the attorneys’ fees
of the Kingdom of Spain, its experts and advisers, as well as any other cost
or expenses incurred, including a reasonable rate of interest as of the date
on which said costs were incurred to the date of their effective payment,
for the [...] costs incurred by Respondent due to this arbitration.”'®

 

4 Cl. Costs, Annex A, Section II. Claimants explain that they “do not seek reimbursement of the costs of hiring the
IDRC, court reporters, interpreters or catering during the hearings in London, which the Claimants agreed to bear
in full, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, in return for Spain’s agreement to convene the merits hearings
in London,” and note that “these costs have been excluded from the Claimants’ disbursements claimed in this
submission.” Claimants add that “[flor the same reason, the Claimants have also deducted the sum of $41,000 from
their claimed share of the ICSID advances on costs, which [...] represent the costs of interpretation paid by ICSID.”

cover the costs of the proceeding: EUR 439,422.13.!®

According to Respondent, “the costs incurred by the Respondent should be paid by the
Claimants in the case that the Tribunal decides not to uphold the Claimants’ claim.”'?
While recognizing that under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention the Tribunal has
discretion to allocate costs, Respondent submits that the Tribunal’s decision must be well
grounded and not be arbitrary, and it should consider the complexity of the proceeding

and the Parties’ conduct.”°

In that regard, Respondent contends that its conduct has been serious, professional, and in
good faith, and that Spain has shown willingness to cooperate.?! According to Spain, the
Tribunal should consider (i) that Respondent submitted its pleadings in a timely manner,

in contrast with Claimants’ actions in connection with the timing for submission of the

(ii) that Respondent refrained from disturbing Claimants’ preparation of their pleadings

*4 The ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a Final Financial Statement of the case account. The
remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

°5 The difference in the disbursements from the case fund allocated to each Party relates to the Parties’ agreement
that the costs of interpretation at the Hearing held 12-19 December 2016 paid from the case fund be covered by the
Claimants only. See emails of 27 August 2015, 6 June 2016, and 24 June 2016; ICSID Letter of 8 December 2017.
It should also be noted that, in accordance with the Parties’ agreement, there were no disbursements from the case
fund administered by ICSID for court reporting and venue relating to the Hearing held in London 12-19 December
2016. Id.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the
parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those
expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the
charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such
decision shall form part of the award.”

The Tribunal notes that Respondent lost on essentially all of the jurisdictional grounds
and on the merits. However, Respondent’s arguments on jurisdiction, particularly
relating to the nature of the Dutch investment, were not trivial and Claimants’ arguments
on the merits were not fully endorsed, in particular their principal basis for assessing
damages was rejected. In the view of the Tribunal, this should be reflected in the

allocation of costs.

(dl) Costs of the Proceeding

With respect to the costs of the proceeding, while Respondent should pay the greater part,
Claimants should also contribute to those costs. Accordingly, the Tribunal assesses the
costs of the proceeding to be divided on the basis of two-thirds to be paid by Respondent
and one-third by Claimants. The total costs of the proceeding paid from the case fund as
indicated above amount to USD 835,234.15 (supra, {| 29), but this amount includes cost
of the interpretation for the Hearing in December 2016 that Claimants agreed to bear in
full regardless of the outcome of the arbitration2® Accordingly, excluding those
interpretation costs (USD 41,020.97), the costs of the proceeding paid from the case fund
that the Tribunal is allocating among the Parties amount to USD 794,213.18.

Two thirds of the above amount would be USD 529,475.45 (Respondent’s share) and one
third of that amount would be USD 264,737.73 (Claimants’ share). The expended
portion of Claimants’ advances to ICSID excluding what pertains to costs of the
interpretation for the Hearing in December 2016 is USD 397,106.59. The difference

37.

Case 1:19-cv-01618 Document 1-4 Filed 06/03/19 Page 16 of 265

between USD 397,106.59 and USD 264,737.73 is USD 132,368.86. Accordingly, the
Tribunal orders Respondent to pay Claimants USD 132,368.86.

(2) Costs of the Parties

With respect to the costs of the Parties, the Respondent should bear its own costs and one

third of Claimants’ costs.

Claimants’ costs excluding the item for costs of the proceeding (i.e. excluding lodging
fee and advances on costs to ICSID) amount to USD 12,441,095.45 + EUR 3,126,405.90
(supra, § 21). One third of those amounts are USD 4,147,031.81 + EUR 1,042,135.3,

which would be Respondent’s share of Claimants’ costs.

AWARD
For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(1) The Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Quantum Principles of 12
March 2019, attached as Annex A is hereby reaffirmed.

(2) Respondent shall pay Claimants the sum of EUR 290.6 million in compensation
for its breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT to provide Claimants with fair and

equitable treatment.

(3) Respondent shall pay Claimants prejudgment interest on that amount from 30 June

2016 until the date of this Award at the rate of 0.234%, compounded monthly.
