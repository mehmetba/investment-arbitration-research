Petition to Enforce Arbitral Award

Petitioner Tethyan Copper Company Pty Limited (“TCC”) brings this action to enforce
an arbitral award (the “Award”) issued on July 12, 2019 in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/1 against
Respondent, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (“Pakistan”), following arbitration proceedings
conducted in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID Convention”). Pursuant to Article 54 of the
ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, arbitral awards issued under the ICSID Convention
are not subject to collateral attack and must be enforced and given the same full faith and credit

as if the award were a final judgment of a court in the United States.

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 2 of 11

Accordingly, TCC requests that this Court (1) enter an order enforcing the Award in the
same manner as a final judgment issued by a court of one of the several states, and (2) enter
judgment against Pakistan and in TCC’s favor in the amounts specified in the Award.

A certified copy of the Award is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Matthew S.
Rozen (“Rozen Declaration”), Exhibit 1 hereto. Copies of the Tribunal’s Decision on
Jurisdiction and Liability (“J&L”) and Decision on Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the
Claims (“ADC”), which are incorporated by reference into the Award, see Award ff 4, 19, 21,
are attached as Exhibits B and C, respectively, to the Rozen Declaration. A copy of the ICSID

Convention is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

Parties
1. Petitioner TCC is a company constituted and registered under the laws of the
Australia.
2. Respondent Pakistan is a foreign state within the meaning of the Foreign

Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1602-1611.
Jurisdiction and Venue

3. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the FSIA,
28 U.S.C. § 1330(a), because this is a “nonjury civil action against a foreign state” on a claim
“with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity” under the FSIA. Pursuant to
Section 1605(a)(1) of the FSIA, Pakistan is not entitled to immunity from this Court’s
jurisdiction in an action to enforce an ICSID Convention award because it has waived that
immunity by agreeing to the ICSID Convention. See Tatneft v. Ukraine, No. 18-7057, 2019 WL
2563159, at *1-2 (D.C. Cir. May 28, 2019) (per curiam); Blue Ridge Investments, L.L.C. v.

Republic of Argentina, 735 F.3d 72, 84 (2d Cir. 2013). Further, pursuant to Section 1605(a)(6)

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 3 of 11

of the FSIA, Pakistan is not immune from suit because this is an action to enforce an arbitral
award governed by the ICSID Convention, which is a treaty in force in the United States for the
recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards. Blue Ridge, 735 F.3d at 85.

4. This Court also has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b),
which provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over actions and proceedings” to enforce awards entered under the ICSID Convention.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Pakistan pursuant to the FSIA,

28 U.S.C. § 1330(b). Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(1) and (4).

6. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seg. does “not apply to
enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] convention.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).
Thus, the FAA’s jurisdictional requirements do not apply to this action.

The Underlying Dispute

7. Through an April 1, 2006 novation agreement, TCC became a party to a joint
venture agreement with the Government of Balochistan to explore potential copper and gold
mining in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. Award at 2 (defining Novation Agreement), 6; J&L
49 217-222, 228, 1328. In February 2011, TCC’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Tethyan Copper
Company Pakistan (“TCCP”), filed an application for a mining lease for the Reko Dig deposit in
northwestern Balochistan. J&L §{ 506, 1264. In November 2011, Balochistan’s Licensing
Authority rejected TCCP’s application. Award § 2, 20; J&L Ff 1264, 1329.

8. Because TCC is an Australian company, its investments are protected by the
bilateral investment treaty between Australia and Pakistan—the Agreement between Australia
and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the Promotion of Investments (the “Australia-Pakistan

Treaty”), Exhibit 3 hereto. The Australia-Pakistan Treaty is intended to “promot[e]” “investment

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 4 of 11

relations” and “strengthe[n]” “economic co-operation” between Australia and Pakistan “in
accordance with the internationally accepted principles of mutual respect for sovereignty,
equality, mutual benefit, non-discrimination and mutual confidence.” Australia-Pakistan Treaty,
pmbl., § 2.

9. Article 13(2) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty provides that if a dispute between
an investor of one contracting state and the other contracting state “cannot be resolved through

consultations and negotiations,” “either party to the dispute” may submit the dispute to the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) for arbitration under the
ICSID Convention, provided that both Australia and Pakistan are parties to the ICSID
Convention “at that time.”

10. Pakistan and Australia are both parties to the ICSID Convention.' As a party to
the ICSID Convention, Pakistan has consented to arbitrate disputes arising under the Australia-
Pakistan Treaty pursuant to the ICSID Convention.

11. On November 28, 2011, TCC filed a request with ICSID for arbitration under the
ICSID Convention. Award § 9. ICSID registered the request on January 12, 2012 and notified
the parties of the registration. Jd. § 10.

12. An ICSID arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal’”’) was constituted on July 12, 2012.
Award § 11. The Tribunal was reconstituted on September 10, 2012 after one of the arbitrators
resigned and was replaced. Id. 12.

13. The Tribunal conducted 32 days of hearings: a Hearing on Jurisdiction and
Liability in Paris, France, from October 6 through October 17, 2014, Award at 12; a Hearing on

Respondent’s Application to Dismiss the Claims, in Paris, France from October 10 through

October 15, 2016, which was continued in Hong Kong from December 3 to December 10, 2016,
and in Paris, France on February 21, 2017, ADC ff 121, 149, 176; and a Hearing on Quantum in
London, United Kingdom, from May 14 through May 24, 2018, Award § 69.

14. On November 10, 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction and
Liability, a 371-page decision that is incorporated by reference into the Award, in which it
decided, among other things, that:

i. The Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the claims submitted to it by
TCC, J&L 4 688;

ii. TCC’s claims were admissible, J&L § 688;

iii. Pakistan had breached its obligations under the Australia-Pakistan
Treaty by: (1) failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to
TCC’s investments within Pakistan’s territory, in violation of
Article 3(2) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; (2) effectively
expropriating the value of TCC’s investment, in violation of
Article 7(1) of the Australia-Pakistan Treaty; and (3) impairing
TCC’s use of its investment, in violation of Article 3(3) of the
Australia-Pakistan Treaty, J&L J 1264, 1328-33, 1372; and

iv. TCC was entitled to be compensated for all damages and losses
resulting from Pakistan’s breaches of the Treaty, in an amount that
was to be determined in a later phase of the arbitration proceeding,
J&L F 1449;

Award § 20.

15. In its Decision, the Tribunal found that Pakistan had—through the contractual and
regulatory framework governing TCC’s investment and Pakistan’s own repeated assurances—
created the legitimate expectation that TCC would be entitled to convert its exploration license
into a mining lease, subject only to compliance with routine government requirements. J&L
4958. The Tribunal noted that TCC had invested approximately $240 million in its exploration

work and completed a feasibility study on the initial mine development of the area in direct

reliance on that legitimate expectation. Id. §{] 1328-1329.

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 6 of 11

16. The Tribunal carefully considered TCC’s mining lease application and concluded
that TCC had fulfilled all applicable requirements and that Balochistan had rejected its
application on pretextual grounds with the motive of implementing its own mining project and
taking the value of TCC’s investment for itself. J&L FF 1264, 1329. The Tribunal concluded
that the denial of TCC’s mining lease application deprived TCC of the entire value of its
investment and thus constituted an unlawful expropriation of TCC’s investment. Id. J 1328.

17. The same day, the Tribunal issued its 421-page Decision on Respondent’s
Application to Dismiss the Claims, which is incorporated by reference into the Award, in which
it considered and rejected Pakistan’s application to dismiss TCC’s claims. Award 4 22; ADC.

18. On July 12, 2019, the Tribunal rendered the 622-page Award, in which it ordered
Pakistan to pay $4.087 billion in compensation, together with pre-award interest from November
15, 2011 until July 12, 2019 at a rate corresponding to the U.S. Prime Rate plus 1 percent,
compounded annually. Award §{ 1858(ID, (IID). In addition, the Award requires Pakistan to
reimburse TCC $2,533,277.08 for the costs of arbitration and $59,447,596.60 for TCC’s legal
fees and other expenses. Jd. f{ 1858(V), (VI). The Award further requires Pakistan to pay post-
award interest at a rate corresponding to the U.S. Prime Rate plus | percent, compounded
annually, and specifies that the amounts shall be paid in US dollars without any reduction, claim
or offset for taxes, other fiscal obligations or other reasons. Jd. {§ 1858(IV), (VID, (VID.

Legal Basis for Relief

19. The ICSID Convention establishes a framework for the resolution of investment

disputes between a foreign sovereign party to the Convention and a national of another State

party to the Convention. The ICSID is the World Bank-affiliated arbitral institution that

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 7 of 11

administers arbitral proceedings under the ICSID Convention, including the arbitration at issue
here.

20. The ICSID Convention provides that an award rendered under the auspices of
ICSID is binding on the parties and is not subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except
those provided for in the ICSID Convention itself. ICSID Convention, art. 53. Article 53 of the
ICSID Convention further requires each party to an award to abide by and comply with the terms
of the award except to the extent that enforcement is stayed. In other-words, in the absence of an
order staying enforcement, an award is enforceable without delay.

21. The ICSID Convention provides that contracting parties must “recognize an
award rendered pursuant to [the] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations
imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.”
ICSID Convention, art. 54(1). The ICSID Convention further provides that a contracting state
“with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may
provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a
constituent state.” Id.

22. By unconditionally undertaking to recognize and enforce any ICSID award in its
own territories pursuant to Article 54, subject only to the remedies provided for in the ICSID
Convention, each Contracting State agreed that should an award be made against it, the
competent authority of another Contracting State not only has the jurisdiction to enforce that
award, but indeed an obligation under international law to do so (and where given the force of
law in a particular municipal law, also a domestic law obligation). Accordingly, in becoming a

State party to the ICSID Convention, and in particular pursuant to Article 54, a State submits to

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 8 of 11

the jurisdiction of the national courts of other Contracting States and/or waives any immunity
from suit in those national courts at the stage of recognition and enforcement of an ICSID award.

23. The United States is a contracting party to the ICSID Convention and is therefore
obligated to enforce the Award as if it were a final judgment of a court in the United States.”
That obligation is fulfilled by 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, which provides:

(a) An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the

convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States. The

pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced and shall be

given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a

court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration

Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards rendered

pursuant to the convention.

24.  Arbitral awards issued against a foreign state pursuant to the ICSID Convention
may be enforced by bringing a plenary action in federal court in compliance with the
requirements for commencing a civil action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and with
the personal jurisdiction, service, and venue requirements of the FSIA. See Micula v. Gov't of
Romania, 104 F. Supp. 3d 42, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2015); Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, 863 F.3d 96, 100, 117-20 (2d Cir. 2017).

25. Awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral
attack in enforcement proceedings under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a. “Member states’ courts are . . . not
permitted to examine an ICSID award’s merits, its compliance with international law, or the
ICSID tribunal’s jurisdiction to render the award; under the Convention’s terms, they may do no

more than examine the judgment’s authenticity and enforce the obligations imposed by the

award.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 102.

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document 1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 9 of 11

26. The ICSID Convention therefore “reflects an expectation that the courts of a
member nation will treat the award as final.” Id.; see also id. at 118 (noting that an “ICSID
award-debtor . . . [is] not . . . permitted to make substantive challenges to the award”); see also
ICSID Convention, arts. 53(1), 54(1). Consistent with this mandate, 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a)
provides that the FAA “shall not apply to enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the
convention,” thereby “mak[ing] [the FAA’s defenses] unavailable to ICSID award-debtors in
federal court proceedings.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 120-21. District courts thus enforce ICSID
awards without allowing substantive challenges to enforcement of the awards. See, e.g.,
Tidewater Inv. SRL v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, No. 1:17-cv-1457, 2018 WL 6605633
at *6 (D.D.C. Dec. 17, 2018); Duke Energy Int'l Peru Investments No. I Ltd. v. Republic of Peru,
904 F. Supp. 2d 131, 132-34 (D.D.C. 2012); Republic of Panama v. Jurado, No. 8:12-cv-1647,
ECF No. 18 (M.D. Fla. June 13, 2013).

Cause of Action and Request for Relief

27.  Arbitral awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are subject to
mandatory enforcement in the courts of the United States, which must give those awards the
same full faith and credit as a final judgment issued by a state court. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

28. The Award was rendered in accordance with the ICSID Convention against
Pakistan and in TCC’s favor. TCC is therefore entitled to enforce the Award’s pecuniary
obligations against Pakistan.

29. Accordingly, TCC is entitled to an order (a) enforcing the Award in the same
manner as a final judgment issued by a court of one of the several states, and (b) entering
judgment in TCC’s favor in the amount specified in the Award.

WHEREFORE, TCC requests that the Court enter an order:

Case 1:19-cv-02424-TNM Document1 Filed 08/09/19 Page 10 of 11

(a) enforcing the Award against Pakistan in the same manner as a final judgment
issued by a court of one of the several states; and
(b) entering judgment against Pakistan and in TCC’s favor ordering Pakistan to pay
TCC:
(i) $4.087 billion in principal;
(ii) Pre-award interest on that principal at a rate corresponding to the
US Prime Rate plus 1% thereon from November 15, 2011 until July 12, 2019,
compounded annually;
(iii) Post-award interest on that principal at a rate corresponding to the
US Prime Rate plus 1% thereon from July 12, 2019 until the date of payment,
compounded annually;
(iv) $61,980,873.70 in costs and attorneys’ fees relating to the arbitration; and
(v) Post-award interest on those costs and attorneys’ fees at a rate
corresponding to the US Prime Rate plus 1% from July 12, 2019 until the date of

payment, compounded annually.
