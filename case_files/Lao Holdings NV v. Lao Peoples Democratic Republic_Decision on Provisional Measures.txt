Subject: Re: Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People's Democratic Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6)
[PROCEDURAL ORDER # 7 + INFORMATION PROVIDED BY MAXWELL CHAMBERS]

The Tribunal is seized of an request for Provisional Measures in support of the Claimant's
Material Breach Application. Having deliberated, and notwithstanding the able argument
presented on behalf of the Claimant, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to
establish all of the requisite elements for such an order, and therefore dismisses the
application, with reasons to follow.
