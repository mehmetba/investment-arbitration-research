COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN
Plaintiff, ARBITRATION AWARDS
V.

JOHN K. BALDWIN; BRIDGE CAPITAL,
LLC,

Defendants.

 

Plaintiff The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (“Plaintiff,” “Lao
PDR,” or “Government”), by and through its counsel of record Givens Pursley LLP, and for the
causes of action against Defendants, pleads, alleges, and complains as follows:

INTRODUCTION
1. Lao PDR files this Complaint for enforcement of two foreign arbitration awards

and entry of judgment pursuant to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 1

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 2 of 457

Foreign Arbitral Awards, 21 U.S.T. 2517, 330 U.N.T.S. 38 (June 5, 1958) (the “New York
Convention”), Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) (9 U.S.C. Sec. 201, et seq.),
and Idaho law.

2. The first foreign award was arbitrated pursuant to Articles 9 and 13 of the
Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, a true and correct copy of
which is attached as Exhibit A.

3. The second foreign award was arbitrated pursuant to pursuant to Article 8(3) of
the Agreement Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments
between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of the Lao
People’s Democratic Republic, a true and correct copy of which is attached as Exhibit B.

4. The Plaintiff seeks judgment against the Defendants John K. Baldwin
(“Baldwin”) and Bridge Capital, LLC (“Bridge”) as the alter egos of Lao Holdings N.V.
(“LHNV”) and Sanum Investments Ltd., (“Sanum’’), the arbitral award debtors.

PARTIES

5. The Plaintiff Lao PDR is a foreign state within the meaning of the Foreign
Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1441(d), 1602-1611.

6. The defendant Baldwin is a native and resident of Idaho and has, for several
decades, operated a “distressed lending” business in the Pacific Northwest, generally under the
umbrella of Bridge.

7. The defendant Bridge is a Nevada limited liability company. Its current business

address is Micro Beach Road, Saipan, The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 3 of 457

8. Non-party Sanum is an arbitral award debtor in a Permanent Court of Arbitration
(“PCA”) arbitration, PCA Case No. 2013-13. Sanum was incorporated in Macau SAR in 2005.
Baldwin established Sanum to use as a corporate vehicle for his gaming investments in Asia.
Sanum's registered office is in a law office in Macau SAR, but it has no employees there. Sanum
has no assets in the United States.

9. Non-party LHNV is an arbitral award debtor in an International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) arbitration, ICISD Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6.
LHNV is a corporation formed under the laws of Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles. Its office is in
Aruba. Baldwin directed an officer of Bridge, in 2011/2012, to form LHNV in Aruba for the sole
purpose of using the Netherlands Bi-Lateral Investment Treaty with the Lao PDR to make an
investment treaty claim for alleged damage to a Sanum investment in the Thanaleng slot club in
the Lao PDR. Baldwin then inserted LHNV into the chain of ownership between himself and
Sanum, so that LHNV owns 100% of Sanum. LHNV has no assets anywhere in the world.

10. Defendants Baldwin and Bridge are alter egos of arbitral award debtors LHNV

and Sanum.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
Subject Matter Jurisdiction

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 4 of 457

Personal Jurisdiction

13. Baldwin and Bridge are subject to quasi in rem jurisdiction in this Court because
they each own real and/or personal property in Idaho. See, Glencore Grain Rotterdam B.V.,
supra.

14. Baldwin’s real property in Idaho includes, inter alia, real estate residences at 7355
E. Cumberland Ct., Hayden, Idaho, 83835, and at 7021 E. Syringa Rd., Hayden, Idaho 83835.
Baldwin also owns a bank account at the First Interstate Bank in Idaho, including account
number xxxxxx3769.

15. Bridge also owns bank accounts at the First Interstate Bank in Idaho, including
account number xxxxxx7611.

16. Under the New York Convention, as codified in 9 U.S.C. Secs. 203 and 207, it is
proper to proceed to enforce these foreign arbitral awards in a Complaint against only the alter
ego defendants. CBF Industria De Gusa S/A v. AMCI Holdings, Inc., 850 F.3d 58 (2d Cir. 2017).

Venue

17. Venue is proper in the District of Idaho. 28 U.S.C. § 1391. Baldwin is a resident
of Idaho. Bridge is also a resident of Idaho by virtue of being subject to the Court’s personal
jurisdiction. Further, the Defendants’ property described above is located in this state.

ALLEGATIONS
Baldwin’s Investments in Laotian Gaming

18. For many years, Baldwin has controlled many companies engaged in the business
of gambling.

19. In 2007, Baldwin learned of an opportunity to invest in new gaming projects in

the Lao PDR. Baldwin used Sanum to hold his interests in the Lao PDR gaming businesses. He

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 4

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 5 of 457

funded the investments through loans from Bridge to Sanum. Using Bridge funds, Baldwin
developed a casino, the Savan Vegas Casino at Savannakhet, Laos and slot clubs. Baldwin
agreed with a local Laos partner, the ST Group, to invest in gaming businesses in Laos and he
also obtained a contractual interest in a slot club controlled by ST Group at Thanaleng, Laos.

20. Between 2007 and 2016, Baldwin's two major interests in Laos were the Savan
Vegas casino and the Thanaleng slot club. The Lao PDR owned 20% of the Savan Vegas casino
but had no interest in the Thanaleng slot club.

21. In 2012, the Lao PDR initiated an audit by Ernst & Young of the books and
records of the Savan Vegas casino.

22. That same year, Baldwin had a dispute with his local partner, the ST Group,
which had initiated a court case concerning Sanum's contractual rights to Thanaleng.

BIT Claims Against Lao PDR

23. Fearing the audit would expose bookkeeping irregularities at the Casino and
having lost the ST Group court case, on August 14, 2012, Baldwin filed two Bi-Lateral
Investment Treaty (“BIT”) claims against Lao PDR.

24. The treaty between the People's Republic of China and Laos, which Sanum could
invoke as a Macau SAR corporation, provided investors a narrow range of rights, limited to
expropriation. Intending to use newer international law claims, including “unfair and inequitable
treatment,” and “denial of justice,” Baldwin, using a well-established treaty-shopping plan, used
LHNV to take advantage of the more favorable Netherlands/Lao PDR Bi-Lateral Investment
Treaty in its arbitration over the Thanaleng slot club against Lao PDR. As noted supra, Baldwin
had inserted LHNV into the corporate ownership chain between himself and Sanum for this

purpose.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 5

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 6 of 457

25. On August 14, 2012, pursuant to Articles 9 and 13 of the Agreement on
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (“Lao-Dutch BIT”), (“the LHNV Proceeding”),
Baldwin initiated Lao Holdings N.V. v. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic, \CISD Case
No. ARB(AF)/12/6, an arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.

26. The arbitral tribunal invested to hear the LHNV claims included Professor
Bernard Hanotiau, Professor Brigitte Stern, and the President of the Tribunal, the Honorable Ian
Binnie. Professors Hanotiau and Stern are two of the most prominent ICSID arbitrators in the
world, sitting on a combined total of more than 85 investment tribunals. President Binnie was a
Justice on the Supreme Court of Canada from 1998 through 2011.

27. Also, on August 14, 2012, pursuant to Article 8(3) of the Agreement Concerning
the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Government of the
People’s Republic of China and the Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic
(“China-Lao BIT”), Baldwin initiated Sanum Investments Limited v. The Lao People’s
Democratic Republic, PCA Case No. 2013-13, an ad hoc arbitration according to UNCITRAL
(“United Nations Commission on International Trade Law’) Rules against the Government (“the
Sanum Proceeding”).

28. The arbitral tribunal invested to hear the Sanum claims included Professor
Bernard Hanotiau, Professor Brigitte Stern, and the President of the Tribunal, Mr. Andres Rigo
Sureda. President Rigo Sureda is the former Acting Vice President and General Counsel of the
World Bank, of which ICSID is affiliated.

29. In both arbitrations, LHNV and Sanum brought claims against Lao PDR for

alleged violations of their international responsibilities to protect foreign investors under the

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 6

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 7 of 457

relevant treaties. The collective total of the claims asserted against Lao PDR amounted to
$1,000,000,000.00 (One Billion Dollars).

30. In the two treaty arbitrations which LHNV and Sanum filed in August 2012, each
claimant made various claims against Lao PDR, including alleged expropriations of several
gaming licenses and unfair and inequitable treatment involving certain investments.

31. In the LHNV case, LHNV claimed inter alia that Lao PDR provided unfair and
inequitable treatment to LHNV, as owner of Sanum, in Sanum’s court case against ST Group.

32. In the Sanum case, Sanum claimed inter alia that Lao PDR had expropriated three
gaming licenses, at the towns of Paksong, Paksan, and Thakhet.

33. The BIT Tribunals were tasked with several preliminary issues relating to
jurisdiction and requests for preliminary relief. There was comprehensive discovery conducted
by American counsel. The merits hearings were scheduled for June 2014 in Singapore.

34. A few days before those hearings, Baldwin, facing an onslaught of proof of his
criminal behavior, conducted negotiations with the Lao PDR and agreed that LHNV and Sanum
would enter into a Deed of Settlement (“Deed”).

35. In the Deed, Baldwin agreed to dismiss all LHNV and Sanum claims and to sell
the Savan Vegas casino within ten months and exit Laos. The Lao PDR did not pay any
compensation in exchange for the dismissal of the arbitrations by the Deed.

36. Baldwin, however, within two weeks, reneged on the Deed and refused to comply
with its terms, including the term to sell the Savan Vegas casino within ten months. If he failed
to sell the casino within ten months, Baldwin had agreed in the Deed to allow the Lao PDR to
take possession and to sell the casino, distributing the sale proceeds according to the ownership

shares.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 7

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 8 of 457

37. Baldwin had also agreed in the Deed to allow a government monitor to review all
transactions during the ten-month sale period. Importantly, Baldwin agreed to pay tax on gross
gaming revenue in an amount to be set by an independent committee.

38. However, within two weeks of signing the Deed, Baldwin refused to allow the
government monitor on the casino premises, refused to participate in creating the tax committee,
and refused to attempt to sell the casino.

39. Even though the Deed stated that during the ten-month sale period, from July 1,
2014 through April 15, 2015, Savan Vegas would pay tax to the Lao PDR, Baldwin directed his
CFO not to pay any tax to the Government.

SIAC Arbitration to Compel Performance of BIT Arbitration Settlement Deed

40. The Lao PDR was forced in August 2014 to initiate a commercial arbitration
under an arbitration clause in the Deed to compel performance of the Deed.

Al. That arbitration was conducted under the auspices of the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”). That SIAC Tribunal president was the Honorable Rosemary
Barkett, formerly a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.

42. Under the guidance of the SIAC Tribunal, on the tenth month after the Deed’s
execution, April 15, 2015, the Lao PDR took control of the casino and sold it by auction sixteen
months later, on August 31, 2016.

43. The SIAC’s final award was issued on June 27, 2017. That tribunal held the Lao
PDR had fully performed its duties under the Deed. It also stated, “it is undisputed that Sanum
failed to have Savan Vegas pay any taxes to Laos....” In addition, that Tribunal found that the
Government auction sale process had produced the maximum sale price for the casino. The sales

proceeds were then distributed according to the terms of the Deed.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 8

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 9 of 457

44. The amounts the SIAC Tribunal awarded to the Lao PDR were paid from an
escrow account which had been established under the Tribunal’s review and was funded from the
sale price of the casino.

45. In August 2019, that award was confirmed as a Judgment by the High Court of
Singapore and is not an issue in this proceeding.

Reinstatement of Original BIT Proceedings and Final Awards

46. The original BIT Tribunals, however, in December 2017, allowed LHNV and

Sanum to reinstate their 2012 original treaty arbitration claims by finding the Deed had been

breached by, inter alia, the type of tax the Lao PDR had adopted for the sale of the casino—the

 

Deed called for a “flat tax” —the Lao PDR’s expert set the tax at 28%.

47. The BIT Tribunals said that 28% was an “ad valorem tax,” not a “flat tax,” and
thus a breach of the Deed.

48. The original August 2012 claims in both cases were then set for a hearing in
September 2018. Both tribunals sat together, but the cases were not consolidated.

49. The arbitral proceedings were complex and extensive. The parties engaged in
extensive discovery, and the arbitrators heard arguments on procedural issues and issued several
interim orders.

50. The BIT Tribunals conducted a final merits hearing in Singapore in September
2018. At the hearing, the parties relied upon hundreds of documentary exhibits, each submitted
opening and closing arguments, and each presented witnesses who testified and were cross-
examined.

51. After those hearings in September 2018, the tribunals closed the record and both

tribunals issued their Final Awards on August 6, 2019.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 9

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 10 of 457

52. The Final Award in Lao Holdings N.V. v. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
ICISD Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6 was entered and became final on August 6, 2019, when it was
issued to the parties by the Secretariat of ICSID, a true and correct copy of which is attached as
Exhibit C.

53. The Final Award in Sanum Investments Limited v. The Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, PCA Case No. 2013-13 was entered and became final on August 6, 2019, when it was
issued to the parties by the Secretariat of the PCA, a true and correct copy of which is attached as
Exhibit D.

54. The Lao PDR had defended the BIT claims, inter alia, on the grounds that
Baldwin had engaged in corrupt and criminal behavior in the Lao PDR. By agreeing to the Deed
in June 2014, Baldwin avoided having to meet those defenses in a merits hearing. In the renewed
hearing on the merits, however, in September 2018, the issues of Baldwin’s criminal conduct
were made central parts of the Lao PDR’s defense.

55. In their Final Awards, the BIT Tribunals agreed that Baldwin had committed
serious crimes in Laos. Both tribunals held that the Lao PDR’s evidence proved it was “more
likely than not” that in July 2012, Baldwin had paid “consultants” circa $500,000, which was
used to bribe Lao PDR officials, inter alia, to stop the Ernst & Young audit of the Savan Vegas
casino and to interfere in the Thanaleng ST Group court proceeding.

56. In addition, both tribunals found as fact that Baldwin had paid a material witness,
Madam Sengkeo, ' $575,000 to prevent her from testifying in the cases. The tribunals found this

payment was an “obstruction of justice.”

' Madam Sengkeo is a Laotian national who worked with Baldwin on several projects starting in
2007. Baldwin called her a friend and a “lobbyist,” whom he retained to “lobby” Lao PDR
officials. In 2014, Madam Sengkeo was identified as a material witness in the arbitration cases.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 10

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 11 of 457

57. The BIT Tribunals held that these facts meant Baldwin acted in bad faith in his
dealings with the Lao PDR and was not entitled to treaty protection under public international
law.

58. The BIT Tribunals then dealt with the merits of each claim LHNV and Sanum had
raised in their two August 2012 notice of arbitrations, i.e., the alleged expropriation of gaming
licenses at Paksong, Paksan, and Thaket, and the alleged lack of “fair and equitable treatment” in
the Thanaleng court case with ST Group.

59. The BIT Tribunals dismissed each claim because LHNV and Sanum had failed to
meet the burden of proof that there had been an expropriation or a denial of justice or unfair and
inequitable treatment.

60. Finally, the BIT Tribunals awarded the Lao PDR its fees, expenses, and costs of
the arbitrations.

6l. The total sum awarded to Lao PDR in the two arbitrations is $3,727,358.98. As
noted above, the LHNV Tribunal awarded the Lao PDR $1,949,106.67 and the Sanum Tribunal
awarded the Lao PDR $1,778,252.21 (collectively, “Final Awards”).

62. LHNV and Sanum have not made any payment to the Lao PDR under the Final
Awards, despite the requirements set forth in the rules that each party undertake to carry out the
awards without delay.

63. Instead, in further evidence of their bad faith, on November 6, 2019, LHNV and

Sanum have filed an action in the High Court of Singapore to “set aside” the two awards.

 

Her role is described in the Final Awards. In particular, the tribunals found that Baldwin paid a
bribe of $575,000 to Madam Sengkeo to prevent her from testifying for the Government in the
arbitration hearings, which the BIT Tribunals held was an “obstruction of justice.” ICSID
Award, para. 157; PCA Award, 156.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 11

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 12 of 457

64. The Arbitral Seat for both arbitrations was the Republic of Singapore. The Final

Awards are thus “foreign” awards, under 9 U.S.C. §207.
Alter Ego Liability of Defendants
A. There is a Unity of Interest and Ownership Between Baldwin and His Companies.

65. Baldwin completely dominates and controls Bridge, LHNV, and Sanum.

66. The BIT Tribunals each found as fact that Baldwin was the “directing mind” of
LHNV and Sanum: “Mr. Baldwin is the directing mind of both Claimant companies. His conduct
throughout was to advance their corporate interests. His bad faith conduct is their conduct.”

67. The BIT Tribunals’ finding that Baldwin is the “directing mind” of LHNV and
Sanum was based upon a close evaluation of Baldwin’s conduct and testimony.

68. Baldwin submitted eight witness statements to the BIT Tribunals in which
Baldwin made clear he alone made all decisions relating to the “corporate” investments in Laos.

69. In these statements, Baldwin never once attributed any decision he made during
his eight years of operations in Laos to a Bridge or an LHNV or a Sanum corporate board of

directors, or to any other officer or director.

70. Rather, Baldwin made clear to the arbitral tribunals that “I,” Baldwin, made every
decision.
71. In his third witness statement, he described how on his first visit to Laos in 2007,

he met the officials of the ST Group and signed the “Master Agreement” governing his
investments in Laos within a five-day visit—thus committing Bridge and Sanum to invest over
$50 million in Laos without any consideration by any corporate body.

72. In all eight witness statements, Baldwin does not once refer to the participation of

his partner, Mr. Scott, in any decisions affecting these Laos investments.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 12

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 13 of 457

723. Baldwin’s witness statements make clear he alone made all business decisions for
Bridge, LHNV, and Sanum.

B. Bridge is the Hub of Baldwin’s Wheel.

74. Bridge is the center of Baldwin’s wheel. Baldwin forms dozens and dozens of
corporations, and Bridge owns many of them, but often Bridge does not exert control by share
ownership.

75. Such is the case here. Baldwin kept ownership of the LHNV and Sanum shares in
his and his partner’s name but the money is controlled by Baldwin’s tentacles in Bridge.

76. ‘When Baldwin signed the Laos ‘’Master Agreement” in 2007 to invest in Laos,
he used Sanum as the signatory on the Laos contracts; but the funds all came through loans from
Bridge.

77. In addition to the Sanum loan that Bridge controlled, Baldwin created another
source of funds for Bridge to take out of Laos—a Bridge Management Contract to manage
Sanum, for which Bridge received additional fees, but Bridge had no management personnel
supervising the management of the casino in Laos.

78. Baldwin also had used Bridge to create LHNV solely to use as a vehicle to sue the
Government under a different Bi-Lateral Investment Treaty than the one Sanum could use.

79. Baldwin’s decision to create LHNV in 2011 and to use it to initiate the LHNV
arbitration in August 2012 illustrates his total control over Bridge and LHNV.

80. In late 2011, when it became apparent to Baldwin that he might have disputes
with the Government, Baldwin instructed Richard Pipes, Bridge Vice President and General

Counsel, to form LHNV in Aruba. Pipes had recognized that investment treaty tribunals have

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 13

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 14 of 457

routinely allowed foreign investors to create new companies to change their nationality to take
advantage of treaties with broader relief.

81. ‘When Pipes made the recommendation to form LHNV, Baldwin alone instructed
him to proceed.

82. Pipes began contact with counsel in Aruba in 2011. In all correspondence with
Aruba counsel, Pipes identified himself as Bridge’s “Vice President and Chief Legal Officer,”
used his Bridge email account, and sent all the required funds to Aruba from a Bridge bank
account located in Idaho at the Idaho Independent Bank. In sum, at Baldwin’s direction, Bridge’s
Pipes created LHNV and then inserted that new company into the corporate chain as the 100%
owner of Sanum.

83. Likewise, Baldwin does not make reference to any action or decision by the
Bridge, LHNV, or Sanum Board of Directors.

84. Seven months after creating LHNV, for the sole purpose of suing the
Government, Baldwin initiated the BIT Claims in August 2012—calling himself the “authorized
representative” of LHNV. Baldwin alone approved LHNV's filing these cases against the
Government.

85. In September 2012, Baldwin directed Crawford, the Savan Vegas CFO, to pay all
money Savan Vegas owed to Sanum directly to Bridge accounts in Idaho. Baldwin wrote to
Crawford: “Please send $220,000 to Bridge today. We’ve assigned the Sanum note to Bridge so
you can pay Bridge direct.”

86. Therefore, from September 12, 2012 through April 15, 2015, all Savan Vegas

loan payments were made to Bridge, skipping Sanum.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 14

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 15 of 457

87. This sum exceeded $40 million. Baldwin issued his instruction one month after he
initiated these two arbitrations, proceedings in which awards of attorney’s fees are routine.

88. Baldwin's assignment of the Sanum loan to Bridge had the effect of removing
assets from Sanum that should have been available in an Idaho bank account to satisfy these
costs awards. It is thus clear that Baldwin’s motivation in skipping Savan Vegas payments to
Sanum was to remove an asset from the Government’s direct reach to satisfy these current costs
awards.

89. Further, from July 2014 through April 2015, while Baldwin wrongfully
maintained exclusive control of the Savan Vegas casino, when pursuant to the July 2014 Deed he
was required to pay tax to the Government, Baldwin refused to do so. During that ten month
period, instead of paying tax to the sovereign Government, Baldwin directed Crawford to send
$430,000 each month to a Bridge account in Idaho. Baldwin told the BIT Tribunals that he was
“escrowing” a tax payment.

90. But when the Government took control of the casino on April 15, 2015, Baldwin
and Bridge did not pay the $4,300,000 in escrowed funds to the Government as back taxes—
Bridge kept the money in its Idaho bank account. Now it is time to pierce the Bridge veil and
have Bridge pay the Government its costs awards.

91. In addition, when LHNV and Sanum were asked by the tribunals to submit their
arbitration fees and expenses at the end of the proceedings, in March 2019, LHNV and Sanum
submitted requests for more than $20 million—none of which had come from their own business
accounts. As the parties had discussed before the arbitrators in the October 2016 hearing noted

above, all of the fees, which over the years from 2012 through 2018 had been paid to LHNV’s

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 15

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 16 of 457

and Sanum's counsel, were authorized and funded by Baldwin and Bridge. Baldwin used
Bridge’s funds to sue the Government.

92. In another benefit to Bridge, the Savan Vegas CFO Crawford testified he wired
Savan Vegas funds due to Sanum directly to a third-party company in Hawaii which Baldwin
owned, Bridge Aina. Crawford testified Baldwin directed him to transfer the funds directly to
Bridge Aina “so the cash would just cut across the companies to make the wiring instructions
easier.”

93. Both BIT Tribunals found as fact that Baldwin acted in bad faith in his reign of
corruption in Laos that, and using Bridge as the fulcrum of his Laos investment, harmed the
Government in the material ways described above.

Cc. LHNV and Sanum are Managed by Bridge Officers from Bridge Offices in
Saipan.

94. In evaluating whether there is alter ego liability, courts also consider the practical
issue of the whether the companies use the same offices and personnel.

95. LHNV? has no employees. Baldwin did not even bother to become a director or
officer of LHNV—he filed the treaty arbitrations after declaring himself LHNV’s “authorized
representative.”

96. Sanum is a Macau SAR company, and keeps a Macau SAR address, but it has no
employees in Macau. To the extent Sanum has employees, they are Bridge employees, and their
office is Bridge's office in Saipan. Bridge's CFO, Crawford, is also Sanum's CFO. Crawford
testified: “The work I do for Sanum is done out of the Bridge Capital office [in Saipan]; there are
no Sanum employees in Macau.”

? LHNV was set up by a company in Aruba that creates such vehicles for use in investment

arbitrations, and for Dutch tax reasons, that company appoints its members as the LHNV
directors. These “directors” take no actions for the business of the corporation.

D. Baldwin Used “Loan Payments” from the Savan Casino for Personal Use and Use
by Related People and Entities.

97. In 2009-2012, Baldwin routinely directed the CFOs of the Savan Vegas and
Casino Co. to send millions of dollars to entities unrelated to Sanum or the Sanum loan.

98. After the BIT Tribunals allowed the Government to take control of the casino on
April 15, 2015, as noted above, the Lao PDR retained the services of BDO Global (“BDO”) to
conduct an audit of the Savan Vegas casino.

99. The BDO audit reports established that the “Sanum Loan” was itself a fraud on
Savan Vegas and Casino Co., the company owned 20% by the Government and 20% by ST
Group. Baldwin had loaded the Credit Facility Agreements (““CFAs”) with high interest rates and
“late fees.” The loan was a demand loan and yet each time Baldwin made a demand for payment,
his CFO would add a late fee.

100. First, BDO determined that Baldwin had sent, at a maximum, $44 million to
Sanum for use in building the Savan Vegas casino complex.

101. Second, BDO determined that Baldwin had caused Savan Vegas to transfer
$85.29 million as payments to Sanum and Bridge on the “Sanum Loan” without applying any
amount to the principal of the loan. To be clear—when the Government took control of the
Savan Vegas and Casino Co. on April 15, 2015, Baldwin’s books and records showed that Savan
Vegas continued to owe $89 million on the loan.

102. BDO found that Baldwin was personally involved in these transfers and that they
did not comply with the terms of the CFAs.

103. BDO found that Baldwin directed the Savan Vegas CFO to send hundreds of
thousands of dollars of the casino’s money, and thus 20% the Lao PDR’s money, directly to:

himself, ($8,044,099); Jim Baldwin, John Baldwin’s brother ($13,286,508); Creative

Entertainment, a new online gaming business Baldwin started ($2,529,000); Ha Tien Casino, a
new casino Baldwin developed in Cambodia ($2,127,916); and other Baldwin-related parties
($5,164,172).

104. All of these payments BDO identified were a fraud on the company and the
minority shareholders, the Lao PDR, and ST Group.

E. Baldwin Engaged in Criminal Behavior.

105. In July 2012, Baldwin was concerned that the audit of the Savan Vegas casino
undertaken by Lao PDR would lead to adverse audit findings and allow the Lao PDR to
intervene and sanction the casino operation. At the same time, Baldwin was concerned that a
court case in Vientiane with his local partner, ST Group, would result in the loss of his role with
the Thanaleng slot club.

106. Baldwin resorted to bribes to stop the audit and the court case.

107. On July 5, 2012, Baldwin sent an email to CFO Crawford informing him that he
needed $500,000 in cash to be sent from the casino to Vientiane in the next week. Crawford
asked why and Baldwin told him the funds would be used to pay a “lobbyist.” Crawford could
only gather $197,000 in U.S. dollars and he wired that sum to the account of Mr. Annousith,
Madam Sengkeo’s son-in-law’.

108. Stymied but not defeated, Baldwin contacted the manager of a bank he owns in

Phnom Penh, Cambodia, the Angkor Capital Bank, and demanded the manager withdraw

3 Mr. Annousith was identified as Madam Sengkeo’s son-in-law. Baldwin later testified he was
a “lobbyist” in Vientiane who was free to spend the $193,000 Crawford wired to his account in
any manner he wished. Baldwin was unable to further describe Madam Sengkeo’s son-in-law or
his activities. The BIT Tribunals accepted that these funds were used to bribe government
officials: “...the Tribunal concludes that it is more likely than not that a bribe was paid to an
unidentified Government official or officials in an unsuccessful effort to advance [LHNV’s]
agenda at the Thanaleng slot club.” ICSID Award, para 148; PCA Award 147.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 18

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 19 of 457

$300,000 in cash and have his personal assistant fly the cash across the border that day to
Vientiane. The manager did so and the next day, Baldwin’s personal assistant deposited the full
$300,000 into the bank account of Madam Sengkeo.

109. The same day, a government official instructed Ernst & Young to terminate the
audit.

110. The BIT Tribunals found as a fact that Baldwin’s “lobbyist” paid the money to a
government official to intervene in Baldwin’s disputes. Baldwin admitted there was no contract
with the lobbyist, and no record of what he had done with $193,000. Baldwin said: “We paid
him a fee . . . it was his money and he could do with it as he wishes.”

111. The Final Awards also concluded that Baldwin directed the payment of “US
$575,000 for the obstruction of the due process of this arbitration by paying Madame Sengkeo
not to testify.”

112. Baldwin’s manifest disregard for the rule of law is evident on the facts of this
issue as well. As noted in the ICSID and PCA Final Awards, “Madam Sengkeo [held a] central
role in dealings between the [LHNV/Sanum] and the Government over many years.” Thus the
course of dealing between Baldwin and Madam Sengkeo taints all of Baldwin’s investments in
Laos, and her testimony would have “shed crucial light on the legality or illegality of many of
the disbursements at issue.”

113. Baldwin’s scheme to silence Madam Sengkeo arose after May 7, 2014, when the
Lao PDR proffered Madame Sengkeo a letter offering immunity for her cooperation in
developing “information and documents related to offering of bribery to government officials.”

114. On May 14, 2014, Baldwin’s counsel applied to the ICSID Tribunal “to allow

Mr. Baldwin to make a ‘personal loan’ to Madam Sengkeo of US $575,000.” As the tribunal

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 19

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 20 of 457

noted, “[g]iven the importance and sensitivity of Madam Sengkeo’s evidence potentially to be
given at the merits hearing, the Tribunal declined to give its permission for a US $575,000 loan
to her from Mr. Baldwin.”

115. Thereafter, Madam Sengkeo rejected the offer of immunity and refused to provide
evidence to the Lao PDR, thus depriving the BIT Tribunals of vital evidence.

116. Despite the ICSID Tribunal’s explicit decision not to allow the payment, the
tribunals found that Mr. Baldwin arranged for Madam Sengkeo to be paid the US $575,000. The
tribunals concluded that “Mr. Baldwin clearly intended to sidestep the Tribunal’s denial of
permission by arranging for the US $575,000 loan from a third party.”

117. On the balance of evidence, both BIT Tribunals held that “Mr. Baldwin and
Madam Sengkeo were involved in channeling funds illicitly to Lao Government officials, and
further that she was paid to secure her loyalty and to avoid her testifying on behalf of the
Government, thereby obstructing justice.”

118. The BIT Tribunals have held the Defendants’ deliberate decision to deceive the
Government, to defraud the tribunals, and pay off critical witnesses in order to defraud the
tribunals or impede the Government’s defense is an unconscionable and egregious breach of
their obligation to arbitrate in good faith.

119. | Baldwin’s criminal conduct in Laos, confirmed in the BIT Tribunals’ findings of
fact, directly harmed the Government in several ways: (i) the Government was a 20%
shareholder in the Savan Vegas casino—by sending $193,000 of the casino’s funds to Madam
Sengkeo through her son-in-law’s bank account, Baldwin used $38,000 of the Government’s
share of casino revenues to pay criminal bribes to stop the Government’s audit of the casino

books and records; (ii) the tribunals found that the audit would have revealed significant

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 20

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 21 of 457

financial irregularities, which harmed the Government as a shareholder—having the audit
terminated by bribery prevented the Government from taking corrective action, including
recovery of its funds; and (iii) the criminal activity increased the very fees the Government seeks
to collect under the awards by increasing counsel’s work in unraveling the criminal schemes with
evidence.

120. Baldwin alone directed the CFO to use corporate funds to pay these criminal
bribes. There was no notice to or action by the Board of Directors of Savan Vegas or Sanum or
Bridge to approve these actions. Bridge/Sanum CFO Crawford testified: “When John Baldwin
instructs me to make a payment, I make a payment.”

121. These criminal acts are compelling proof that Baldwin views the corporations and
their funds as his personal tools and his personal funds which he can use for whatever reason,
including committing criminal acts. He has no regard for the corporate form or corporate
purposes.

122. Importantly, Baldwin diverted corporate assets for personal use to avoid criminal
exposure. The $575,000 payment Baldwin made to Madam Sengkeo, a material witness in Laos,
was to protect himself by preventing the witness from testifying in the arbitration that Baldwin
had paid bribes to Laos government officials, thus preventing her from providing proof he had
violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

123. There is an additional bribe Baldwin paid in Cambodia to obtain a gaming license
that reflects upon his modus operandi that “corporate funds” are his personal funds.

124. In August 2012, just a month after paying bribes in Laos as described by the BIT
Tribunals, Baldwin instructed his employees in Cambodia to pay a bribe of $120,000 to General

Sen, a Cambodian official. Baldwin had incorporated a bank in Phnom Penh, the Angkor Capital

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 21

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 22 of 457

Bank. On August 27, 2012, Baldwin directed the bank’s managing director to withdraw $40,000
in cash to pay to General Sen at a meeting scheduled for that afternoon. In authorizing his
employees to use the bank’s funds to pay a bribe to a Cambodian official to secure a gaming
license, Baldwin told them: “You can use my money, you can make a Bridge payment from the
bank, or just advance an amount and hold it in suspense until I get there and decide what to do.”

125. Again, this is another proof that to Baldwin, corporate form means nothing—it is
all his money to do as he pleases. Corporate records are an afterthought.

KF. There is Additional Evidence of Fraud in Corporate Operations.

126. Sanum received funds in 2008/2009 from Baldwin through Bridge to build the
Savan Vegas casino in Savanakhet, Laos. The financial result was a “Sanum Loan,” which the
casino company, Savan Vegas and Casino Company Ltd., owed to Sanum, which in turn owed to
Bridge.

127. The funds were advanced largely during construction in 2008, and the Savan
Vegas casino opened for business in mid-2009. Baldwin then belatedly created two loan
agreements between Sanum and Savan Vegas, the CFAs.

128. From 2009 through September 2012, the Savan Vegas CFO paid all cash from
casino operations above expenses to Sanum at Baldwin’s sole direction, and then routed the
funds to Bridge.

129. The “Sanum Loan” itself was a fraud on the Savan Vegas and Casino Co. and its
shareholders—the Government owned 20% of the Savan Vegas company and the local partner,
ST Group owned 20% (through 2012). From the inception of the casino’s business in 2009
through the transfer of control under the Deed in April 2015, Baldwin controlled the flow of

Savan Vegas funds to repay the loan so that neither minority shareholder ever received any

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 22

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 23 of 457

payments from the casino. Baldwin, however, made continual withdrawals under the loan that
amounted to $85 million.

130. The process of the withdrawals has been well documented by discovery and
testimony in the arbitration cases. From 2012 through 2015, Clay Crawford was the CFO of
Savan Vegas. He then became CFO of Bridge and Sanum. He has testified in the arbitrations that
he transferred cash from the casino operations solely in response to Baldwin’s instructions,
usually made in telephone calls: "'The majority of loan payments would be initiated by Baldwin;
I would check the cash and then make the payment.”

131. The Sanum Loan agreements, the CFAs, required Sanum to document each
request for payment from Savan Vegas. Before Crawford became CFO, in 2012 Baldwin hired a
new Bridge CFO, David Jensen. Jensen noted the appropriate documentation under the CFAs to
authorize loan repayments from Savan Vegas to Sanum was missing for two years. His
“solution” was to create false documents, backdate them and have a former general manager sign
them, even though at the time of signature, he was no longer general manager.

132. Jensen's fraudulent process was then executed by the Savan Vegas CFO,
Crawford, who admitted the scheme in his testimony.

133. The Government then retained BDO, international auditors based in Hong Kong
to testify in the arbitrations. BDO confirmed that Sanum caused Savan Vegas to back-date the
loan documentation and to have it signed by an employee no longer responsible for that activity.

134. In another example of outright fraud which also cost the Government 20% of
$2.42 million, Baldwin directed Crawford to pay Debevoise & Plimpton’s invoices during the
arbitration cases. At the outset of the treaty arbitrations, in 2012, Baldwin retained Debevoise &

Plimpton, New York (“Debevoise”) to represent his interests. Under their agreement,

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 23

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 24 of 457

Debevoise’s clients were Bridge, LHNV, and Sanum. Debevoise routinely addressed and sent its
legal invoices to Bridge’s offices in Saipan, addressed to Bridge, LHNV, and Sanum. But
Baldwin directed Crawford, his CFO, to use Savan Vegas funds to pay Debevoise.

135. This scheme was a fraud on the Government. Baldwin had Crawford use the
funds of the Savan Vegas and Casino Co., 20% owned by the Government, and 20% owned by
ST Group, to pay 100% of Debevoise invoices. Baldwin took the invoices Debevoise sent to its
clients Bridge, LHNV, and Sanum in Saipan, and sent them to Crawford at Savan Vegas located
in Savanakhet, Laos. Baldwin instructed Crawford to use Savan Vegas cash to pay Debevoise
for work for Bridge, LHNV and Sanum. To create this fraud, Crawford created fake, false
invoices. Crawford copied the Debevoise letterhead, added the addressee as Savan Vegas and
Casino Co., added the amount of the original invoice, and thus created a “Debevoise” invoice
addressed to Savan Vegas.

136. Crawford testified that he created the false “Debevoise” invoices because when he
sent wire instructions to the Laos bank, they required a copy of the invoice that was being paid;
not wanting the bank to see he was paying a Bridge/LHNV/Sanum invoice with Savan Vegas
funds, he created the fake invoices to deceive the bank and ultimately the Government.

137. The CFO then sent these fraudulent invoices to Savan Vegas’ Laos bank, which
duly wired the casino’s funds to Debevoise. In this fraud and abuse of the corporate form,
Baldwin paid his legal bills to sue the Government using 20% of the Government’s casino funds.

138. But as noted above, CFO Crawford did as he was told by Baldwin to make these
wrongful payments of $2.42 million, 40% of which belonged to the two minority shareholders.

139. In addition, at no time during Baldwin’s control of the Savan Vegas casino, from

January 2008 through April 2015, did Baldwin make or allow any payments from the Savan

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 24

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 25 of 457

Vegas casino to the other shareholders, the Government, and ST Group. Over that period,
Baldwin directed the CFO to transfer over $85 million from Savan Vegas to Sanum and to
Bridge without a single payment to Lao PDR.

G. Baldwin and Bridge Entered Into Contracts With the Intent to Avoid Performance.

140. In 2007, when Baldwin was negotiating with ST Group over the terms of an
investment in the Laos gaming sector, he learned that the Government had made two grants for
casino licenses, one at Savanakhet and one at Paksong. They were linked—the license holder
had to build both, even though the site at Paksong was remote and not as valuable as the site at
Savanakhet, on the Mekong River at a bridge crossing to Thailand.

141. Baldwin agreed, but he never had any intention to build the required $25 million
casino at Paksong. Instead, he kept misleading ST Group and the Government so that he could
keep a monopoly on gaming businesses in three Laos provinces that were contingent upon the
Paksong license.

142. The PCA Tribunal made express findings of fact that Baldwin entered into the
Paksong contract with no intention of performing it, but maintained his bad faith behavior to
control monopoly rights in three Laos provinces to prevent another investor from entering the
Laos gaming market.

H. Enforcement of these Costs Awards Against LHNV and Sanum is Impossible.

143. LHNV is a shell company and a corporate investment vehicle with no assets other
than its nominal interest in Sanum. It was formed purely for utilizing the Lao-Netherlands BIT; it
is and has always been a corporate entity without any business, employees, or retained assets.

144. Likewise, Clay Crawford, CFO of Bridge and Sanum, testified that Sanum had
minimal remaining assets consisting of outstanding loans to two small Baldwin gaming

operations in Cambodia.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 25

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 26 of 457

145. Neither arbitral award debtor has any assets in the United States.

146. The alter ego issue was in fact discussed by the parties before the LHNV Tribunal
in October 2016 at a hearing on the Lao PDR’s motion for security for costs. The Lao PDR
argued that since LHNV and Sanum were shell companies, were it to prevail and receive an
award for fees and costs, LHNV and Sanum would be judgment proof, hiding behind Baldwin,
not a named party. In arguing against the motion, LHNV’s counsel argued that the tribunals
should not order security for costs, but should recognize that if the Lao PDR received an award
for costs, it could pursue an alter ego claim against Baldwin. LHNV’s counsel stated:

Mr. Branson [Lao PDR's counsel] knows how all these companies are sort

of linked together and if he wants to try to enforce Awards for costs later on

against a company that is not LHNV, he has everything he might need to be able

to do that. This is just simply not the same situation as if they were sat across the

table not knowing where the assets lie on our side of the table. . . . But the fact is,

it is not an unknown third-party funder who you can’t even bring an alter ego

claim against, if they want to try to claim money over against Mr. Baldwin that’s

not paid by LHNV, they know who he is and they know they can make that

attempt.”

147. And so it has come to pass. The Lao PDR must make that attempt “to claim
money over against Mr. Baldwin that’s not paid by LHNV” because LHNV and Sanum have
refused to pay the costs awards.

CAUSES OF ACTION

COUNT I---ENFORCEMENT OF THE ARBITRAL AWARDS AND ALTER
LIABILITY

 

148. The Final Awards are binding and subject to enforcement.
149. Article 34.2 of the UNCITRAL Rules, pursuant to which Sanum agreed to have
the arbitration conducted, states that “[t]he award shall be . . . final and binding on the parties.

The parties undertake to carry out the award without delay.” Likewise, Article 52(4) of the

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 26

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 27 of 457

ICSID(AF) arbitration rules, which LHNV consented to use, provides that “[t]he award shall be
final and binding on the parties.”

150. | Notwithstanding their commitment to undertake “to carry out the [A]ward without
delay,” Sanum and LHNV have failed to pay the amounts awarded to the Lao PDR in the Final
Awards.

151. The United States implemented the New York Convention pursuant to Chapter 2
of Title 9 of the U.S. Code. See 9 U.S.C. § 201, et seg. Section 207 of that Chapter provides:
“The court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of
recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said Convention.”

152. The New York Convention provides that covered awards must be enforced,
absent very specific and limited grounds. 9 U.S.C. § 207 provides that confirmation is mandatory
“unless [the Court] finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement
of the award specified in the said Convention.” 9 U.S.C. § 207. Accordingly, US courts have
little discretion to refuse to enforce an award under the FAA.

153. Under the New York Convention, this Court is a “secondary court,” with
authority only to confirm and to enforce the awards, unless one of the express grounds listed in
the Convention justifies refusal.

154. No grounds listed in the Convention to justify refusal to enforce the awards exists
in this case.

155. Thus, pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207, the Lao PDR is entitled to immediate
recognition and enforcement of the Award under the New York Convention.

156. Equity demands that the Defendants be held liable to pay the full amount of the

two awards in these arbitration cases.

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 27

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 28 of 457

157. The "issues of alter ego and veil piercing are equitable questions." Lunneborg v.
My Fun Life, E. Edwards, and C. Edwards, 163 Idaho 856, 421 P. 3d 187, 202 (Idaho 2018)
(citing Wandering Trails LLC v Big Bite Excavation, Inc., 156 Idaho 586, 594, 329 P.3d 368,
376 (Idaho 2014).

158. There is no litmus test to determine when the corporate veil will be pierced; the
result will depend on the circumstances of each particular case. But, "(1) there must be a unity of
interest and ownership that the separate personalities of the corporation and the individual no
longer exist, and (2) that if the acts are treated as those of the corporation alone, an inequitable
result will follow." Lunneborg, supra at 200.

159. The two foreign arbitral tribunals each made findings of fact that Baldwin is the
“directing mind” of LHNV and Sanum. LHNV Award, {| 236; Sanum Award, {| 174. There is
clear proof that Baldwin dominated and controlled the operations and finances of Bridge, LHNV,
and Sanum, so that the separate corporate personalities of each ceased to exist.

160. Bridge, although a non-shareholder in the award debtors, LHNV and Sanum, is
liable under the alter ego legal doctrine as an intimately intertwined company in Baldwin's web
that was involved in the creation of LHNV and Sanum and was the beneficiary of Baldwin's
misconduct in utilizing these corporate vehicles for his and its benefit. See Lunneborg, supra
(piercing the veil of a related party, not a shareholder).

161. The multiple facts which compel the conclusion that the Court must pierce the
veil and hold Defendants John K. Baldwin and Bridge liable for the debts asserted here by the
Lao PDR, include, inter alia, (i) multiple facts proving the assertion that Baldwin conducted the
affairs of these companies with a unity of interest such that the separate identities of the

companies ceased to exist, (ii) fraud upon the Government, (iii) fraud upon the tribunals, where

COMPLAINT TO ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRATION AWARDS - 28

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 29 of 457

both (ii) and (iii) made the conduct of the arbitration cases more complex and thus more
expensive, adding materially to the Lao PDR’s costs which the Plaintiff is seeking to recover in
this proceeding, as well as (iv) multiple facts proving disregard of the corporate forms, and
(v) multiple misuses of corporate funds. In essence, Baldwin treated any money in any Baldwin
owned company as "his money" and he directed his employees to send it to any person or
corporate entity as he alone decides.

162. The Lao PDR has equity on its side and piercing the LHNV and Sanum corporate
veils is necessary to prevent hardship to the Lao PDR. Baldwin ran a criminal enterprise in Laos,
bribing Government officials, paying a witness not to testify, stealing funds from the
Government’s co-owned investment, the Savan Vegas casino, and dealing in all phases of his
operations with the Government in bad faith.

ATTORNEY FEES

163. It has been necessary for Lao PDR to retain counsel to bring this action. The
Plaintiff hereby requests that the Court award the Plaintiff the costs and fees it incurs in this
matter pursuant to, among other provisions, Idaho Code §§ 12-120, 121, and 123, and any other
applicable provision of law.

164. The Plaintiff further requests attorney fees and costs against the Defendants as
alter egos of the arbitral award debtors due to their refusal in bad faith to pay the Final Awards.

165. In the event of a default judgment, the Plaintiff requests that the Court award it its
reasonable fees incurred in bringing this matter, in the amount of $10,000.00.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Whereas the Plaintiff prays:

1. OVERVIEW

1. Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Shawn Scott, two U.S. entrepreneurs who were experienced in
a number of businesses including gambling facilities, became involved in casinos and slot
machines in Laos in 2007. For this purpose, they caused two companies to be incorporated
in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles, Lao Holdings NV (“LHNV”), and a subsidiary Sanum
Investments (“Sanum”) in Macau (collectively referred to as “the Claimants”). Mr.
Baldwin and Mr. Scott, using various corporate structures partnered with a Laotian
conglomerate (“ST Holdings”) in two casino projects and three slot machine clubs in Laos
positioned near its border with Thailand. One of the casinos, the Savan Vegas Hotel and
Casino (“Savan Vegas”), was built and operated successfully. The second casino, Paksong

Vegas Casino (“Paksong Vegas”), was never built.

2. Within three years there was a falling out between the Claimants and their local partner.
ST Holdings ceased cooperation with Sanum, initiated litigation against it and shut Sanum
out of Thanaleng, the most profitable of the slot clubs. Mr. John Baldwin testified that ST
Holdings was closely connected to leading politicians in the Respondent Government. He
said that ST Holdings orchestrated a series of wrongful Government acts against LHNV
which led to the result, designed by the Government, of driving LHNV out of Laos and
appropriating for the Government the wealth created by the investment and expertise of

Mr. Baldwin and his associated companies.

3. The Claimants initiated arbitrations by LHNV under the bilateral investment treaties
between Laos and the Netherlands,' and by Sanum pursuant to a similar investment treaty
between Laos and Macau (now China).? These arbitrations have consumed multiple
proceedings and years of litigation. Eventually Sanum obtained an award against ST
Holdings from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) for over US $200

million. Sanum is not a claimant before this Tribunal, and the Tribunal does not purport

' Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the

Netherlands, signed on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.

2 Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of The Lao People’s
ic Republic C the Enc and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 31 January

1993, as amended on 10 April 2006.

 

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 72 of 457

to address its claims. However, much of the evidence of Mr. John Baldwin is related to
both companies, and as he was the directing mind of both companies, and their principal
witness, references will be made to Sanum from time to time (or collectively to “the
Claimants” in the plural) as part of the background to the disposition of the LHNV claims.
Moreover, counsel for the Claimant advised that it did not withdraw “any factual
allegations, as the totality of the facts remain relevant to certain treaty breaches for

which the Claimants will seek relief.”

4. The Respondent Government’s position is that it has been dragged into a business dispute
between private parties, the Claimants and ST Holdings for whose conduct it has no
responsibility. In any event, the Government says, the Claimants’ business efforts in Laos
were characterized by bribery and corruption, and their claims ought to be dismissed
because of the absence of “clean hands” as well as on the merits. The Claimants point out
correctly, that the Government has failed to demonstrate any substantial pursuit of the

officials who, in the Government’s view, took the bribes.

5. The Tribunal concludes that the LHNV claims must be dismissed. The dispute grew out
of a commercial fight between private businesses. The Respondent Government became
involved in aspects of the dispute as a regulator of the gambling business in Laos, as a
shareholder in Sanum, and through its responsibility for the administration of justice in
Laos, but the Claimants have failed to establish the facts necessary to ground liability in

international law under the BIT in those respects.

6. The Tribunal has carefully considered each element of LHNV’s myriad Treaty claims,
including the claim of expropriation of Thanaleng and the allegations of breaches of
Articles 3(1), 3(2) and 4 with respect to Thanaleng, Savan Vegas and the slots clubs at Lao
Bao and Ferry Terminal, and Article 3(4) of the BIT with respect to Savan Vegas, and
concludes for the reasons that follow that there is no merit in any of the claims and

allegations brought before this Tribunal.

At the same time, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has not established bribery and
corruption against the Claimants on “clear and convincing evidence”. Nevertheless, the
evidence of multiple financial transactions by Mr. John Baldwin with Madam Sengkeo, the
Claimants’ local consultant in Laos and conduit to Government officials, taken
cumulatively, establishes gross financial impropriety to the lesser standard of a balance of
probabilities in respect of some investments as well as bad faith. While the Government
has not always behaved appropriately (as found by the Tribunal in the Second Material
Breach Application), and politics undoubtedly played a role in the worsening relations
between the Government and the Claimants, LHNV has failed to demonstrate any
legitimate expectations or establish other violations of the BIT including fair and equitable
treatment. The evidence of their principal witness and directing mind, Mr. John Baldwin
is not consistent with much of the documentation and is not reliable. Payments on Mr.
Baldwin's instructions to a key witness, Madam Sengkeo, to purchase her refusal to testify

at the merits hearing, go to the root of the integrity of the arbitration.
In all instances LHNV has failed to meet its burden of proof.

The claims of LHNV are dismissed with costs.

2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

10.

The Tribunal has issued the following decisions during the proceeding: (i) Decision on
Jurisdiction of 21 February 2014; (ii) Decision on the Merits on the First Material Breach
of 10 June 2015, (iii) Decision on Costs of 5 November 2015 and (iv) Decision on the
Second Material Breach of 15 December 2017 (“Decision on the Second Material
Breach”). The full procedural history of this case is described in these decisions. These
Decisions, and the Decision on the Second Material Breach, are an integral part of the
Award and are appended hereto as follows: i) Decision on Jurisdiction of 21 February 2014
(Annex A); (ii) Decision on the Merits on the First Material Breach of 10 June 2015
(Annex B), (iii) Decision on Costs of 5 November 2015 (Annex C) and (iv) Decision on

the Second Material Breach (Annex D).

The procedural details of this arbitration following the Decision on the Second Material

Breach are summarized below.

12.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 74 of 457
13

In the Decision on the Second Material Breach, the Tribunal ruled as follows:

227. The Second Material Breach Application is allowed.

228. Pursuant to Section 32 of the Settlement, the Treaty arbitration is
revived on the basis jointly and severally of the Government’s breaches
of:

(a) Section 8, which promised a “new flat tax”, but instead the Government
imposed a 28% ad valorem tax on gross gaming revenues;

(b) Section 23, which promised the Claimants relief from “current criminal
investigations”, which nevertheless have been revived.

229. Both of these breaches constitute material breaches that deprived the
Claimants of the intended benefits (or “bargain”) promised by each of
Section 8 and Section 23.

230. Except as aforesaid, the grounds of revival relied on by the Claimants
are rejected.

231. The parties are instructed to confer and propose to the Tribunal a
timetable for the renewed Treaty arbitration within 30 days of the date of
this decision.

232. A pre-hearing teleconference to resolve any outstanding issues will
be held within 45 days of the date of this decision.

233. The issue of costs of this application is reserved to be dealt with at
the conclusion of the hearing on the merits.

As instructed by the Tribunal in its Decision on the Second Material Breach, on 14 January
2018, the Claimant LHNV [being the sole Claimant in the ICSID proceeding] submitted
its proposal regarding the timetable and requested the Tribunal to hold the hearing on the
merits for this case after the scheduled hearing of related but separate proceedings
identified as Lao Holdings N.V. v. Lao People’s Democratic Republic (ICSID Case No.
ARB(AF)/16/2)/ Sanum Investments Limited v. Lao People’s Democratic Republic (ICSID
Case No. ADHOC/17/1) (the “BIT II Proceedings”). The Claimant also requested an in-
person pre-hearing conference with the objective of exploring with the Tribunal how to

proceed and for the Parties to receive any further instructions.

On 18 January 2018, the Respondent filed its response objecting to Claimant’s proposal to
schedule a hearing after the BIT II Proceedings. The Respondent requested that the

Tribunal schedule the hearing in this case within sixteen weeks as to not further delay the

20.

21.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 75 of 457

proceeding. Further exchanges by the Parties on this matter were submitted by Claimant

on 26 January 2018 and 16 February 2018 and by Respondent on 29 January 2018.

On 19 February 2018, having heard the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal decided the date for
the hearing on the merits. The Tribunal invited the Parties to confer on a schedule for the

exchange of written submissions and other logistical matters.

On 2 March 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to reach an
agreement on the scope and nature of the Tribunal’s instructions from 19 February 2018.

As a result, each Party sent its proposal separately for the Tribunal’s consideration.

On 7 March 2018, the Tribunal decided to schedule a pre-hearing conference and provided
the Parties the corresponding agenda of the items to be discussed in the pre-hearing
conference. On 19 March 2018, the Claimant LHNV submitted its positions regarding the
items in the agenda for the pre-hearing conference as well as a proposed procedural order.
On 20 March 2018, the Respondent submitted its comments to Claimant’s communication
of 19 March 2018 and corresponding proposals. On 21 March 2018, the Tribunal held a

pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by teleconference.

On 26 March 2018, as discussed during the pre-hearing organizational meeting, the
Claimant LHNV provided the list of claims for which it no longer would seek specific

relief.

On 29 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10 on the organization of the

hearing.

On 23 April 2018, the Tribunal, through the Secretary of the Tribunal, reminded
Respondent of the deadline provided in Procedural Order No. 10 for it to inform whether
the Respondent would withdraw any defences in light of Claimant’s withdrawal of claims
of 26 March 2018. On 24 April 2018, the Respondent confirmed that it maintained its

defences.

On 15 May 2018, pursuant to paragraph 8 of Procedural Order No. 10, the Respondent

filed an Application for Additional Evidence, together with an index of supporting

054-055 and three additional documents not identified for the record.

On 16 May 2018, each Party submitted the preliminary list of witnesses for cross-

examination at the hearing.

On 30 May 2018, the Claimant filed its response to the Respondent’s Application for
Additional Evidence together with Exhibits C-1225 to C-1227, and Legal Authorities CL-
379 to CL-389.

By letter of 31 May 2018, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to order the Claimant to
inform it on the order of presentation of the witnesses to be examined at the scheduled
hearing. Additionally, the Respondent requested the examination from Lao PDR via video-
link of the following witnesses: Minister Kmabay Damlath, Dr. Sinlavong

Khoutphaythoun, and Minister Chaleune Yiapaoheu.

On 6 June 2018, the Tribunal provided further instructions to the Parties regarding the
submissions on the list of witnesses for cross-examination at the scheduled hearing. On 8
June 2018, the Claimant filed its response opposing the Respondent’s request for the
witnesses’ video-link testimony, together with Exhibits C-1224, C-1235 and Legal
Authority CL-390.

On 12 June 2018, the Centre informed the Parties that Ms. Catherine Kettlewell, ICSID
Legal Counsel, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal, replacing Ms. Anneliese

Fleckenstein.

On 15 June 2018, the Respondent filed its reply to its Application for Additional Evidence.
On this same date, the Claimant filed its objection to the Respondent’s preliminary witness

list, together with Exhibit C-1237.

On 22 June 2018, the Respondent filed its response to the Claimant’s opposition to the

On 26 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12, on the Respondent’s

request for the examination of witnesses via video-link.

On 27 June 2018, the Respondent filed a request for clarification of Tribunal’s Procedural
Order No. 11. On this same date, it stated its agreement to the full consolidation of this
proceeding with the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) proceeding Sanum
Investments Limited (People’s Republic of China) v. the Government of the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic — PCA Case No. 2013-13 (the “PCA Proceeding”).

On 28 June 2018, the Tribunal issued an amended Procedural Order No. 11, correcting

certain typographical errors.

By letter of 28 June 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Claimant’s request
objecting to the Respondent’s witness list was approved and invited the Parties to submit

their final witness lists.

On 5 July 2018, the Tribunal addressed the Respondent’s communication of 27 June 2018,
concerning the full consolidation of this proceeding with the PCA Proceeding. The
Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not consider the consolidation as “practical or

necessary at this late stage of the proceeding”.

On 6 July 2018, each Party submitted its final witness lists. The Claimant excluded one

witness in accordance with the Tribunal’s decision contained in its letter of 28 June 2018.

On 9 July 2018, the Parties jointly requested the Tribunal for a one-day extension for the
further deadlines in the organization of the hearing. On 11 July 2018, the Tribunal took

note of the Parties’ agreed extensions.

On 17 July 2018, the Claimant submitted a request for additional evidence to rebut the

Respondent’s additional evidence pursuant to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 11.

On 18 July 2018, the Claimant submitted a request to substitute Dr. Thomas Zitt for Mr.
Steven Rittvo for examination on the Innovation Group’s Expert Report at the scheduled

for the substitution of experts of 18 July 2018.

On 31 July 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13, deciding that the scheduled

6. The admissibility of the further report of Professor Joseph Kalt is
deferred pending a decision following the merits hearing as to whether a
hearing on damages and quantum is required.”

On 10 August 2018, the Respondent filed a request to strike the witness statement of Mr.
William Greenlee, together with Appendices | through 4. By communication of the same
date, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to include new evidence into the

record (Exhibit LHRE-164 and LHRE-165).

On 17 August 2018, the Claimant filed its response opposing the Respondent’s request to
strike Mr. Greenlee’s witness statement from the record, together with the following
supporting documentation: Exhibit C(B)-434, C(B)-492, C-1242, R-001 and R-036. On the
same date, the Claimant filed its observations, partially agreeing with the Respondent’s
request to include new evidence into the record. On 20 August 2018, the Tribunal invited

the Respondent to comment on the Claimant’s observations.

On 20 August 2018, the Claimant filed a request to increase their examination time at the
hearing and sent a proposed hearing schedule for the Tribunal’s consideration. On 22

August 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on Claimant’s proposal.

On 23 August 2018, the Respondent filed a reply to the Claimant’s response concerning its
request to strike Mr. Greenlee’s witness statement and its observations to the Claimant’s
position towards its request to include new evidence into the record. This submission was

filed together with Appendices 1 through 5.

On this same date, the Claimant submitted additional observations to the Respondent’s
comments on Mr. Greenlee’s witness statement and requested the Tribunal to strike from
the record an exhibit of 291 pages filed by the Respondent together with BDO’s expert
report as part of the Respondent’s additional evidence submitted pursuant to Procedural
Order No. 11. The Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on these two submissions

by the Claimant.

On 23 August 2018, the Respondent submitted its opposition to the Claimant’s request for

an enlargement of the examination time, together with Appendices | through 3.

On 24 August 2018, the Respondent filed its observations on the Claimant’s objection to
the introduction of the exhibit to BDO’s expert report, and its rejoinder on Mr. Greenlee’s

witness statement.

On the same date, the Claimant informed the Tribunal and the Respondent of its decision

to withdraw their request to cross-examine Sivath Sengdouangchanh at the hearing.

On 25 August 2018, the Claimant requested the Tribunal’s clarification on paragraph 3.ii
of Procedural Order No. 10, concerning the witnesses’ examination. On 26 August 2018,

the Respondent filed its observations to this request.

On 28 August 2018, the Respondent withdrew the witness statement of Mr. Vanheung

(Vanheuang) Nanthachak from the record.

On 29 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15, on (1) Respondent’s
request to strike from the record Mr. William Greenlee’s witness statements; (2)
Respondent’s request to introduce exhibits LHRE-164 and LHRE-165; (3) Claimant’s
request to extend the time assigned at the hearing; (4) Claimant’s request to exclude the
BDO Report submitted by the Respondent, and (5) Claimant’s request for advance notice
for witness examination. These issues were decided as follows:

“1, The Respondent’s request to strike from the record Mr. William
Greenlee’s witness statements is premature.

2. Exhibits LHRE-164 and LHRE-165 are to be admitted into evidence.

3 Each party shall have equal time and is to determine the order in which
its own cross-examinations proceed as well as time allocation.

4. The Claimants’ request to exclude from the record the 291 additional
pages attached to the BDO Report contained in Exhibit LHRE-161 is
granted.

5. The Parties are not required to provide advance notice of topics to be
covered in cross-examination.”

By letter of the same date, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confer and provide to the

Tribunal a final hearing schedule.

On 30 August 2018, the Claimant submitted the Parties’ final and agreed hearing schedule.

3. OVERVIEW OF THE FACTS

3.1. Laos: Claimants’ Investments in Laos

 

64. As mentioned earlier, the Claimant, LHNV, owned directly and indirectly through its
subsidiary, Sanum, gambling assets in Laos including the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino
Complex in Savannakhet Province. The Casino is strategically located near the Friendship
Bridge which spans the Mekong River between Laos and Thailand. The Claimants also
had an investment in “slot clubs” located at the Thai border at Lao Bao and Savannakhet
Ferry Terminal (located at the Savannakhet/Mukdahan checkpoint), all in the Savannakhet
Province and at Thanaleng to the Northwest. LHNV and its subsidiary Sanum, claim to

have invested many millions of dollars in these projects.*

4 The Claimants’ principal, Mr. John Baldwin, testified as follows:

Q. ... Can you tell us when Sanum first invested in Laos and what kind of money it invested, at what time
period?

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 85 of 457
24

3.2. The Original Treaty Claims

65. The Claimants allege expropriation without compensation and Treaty breaches in respect
of their investment in gambling projects described in the Project Development Agreement
(“PDA”) dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, as well as the three
slot clubs, Thanaleng, Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry. The claims also relate to the
expected expansion of the Savannakhet Airport and opportunities for development in the

Special Economic Zone at Thakhet.

66. LHNV initiated its ICSID proceedings on 14 August 2012 against the Respondent, before
the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”)
pursuant to the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments
between Laos and the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the Arbitration Rules (Additional
Facility) of ICSID (“ICSID-AF Rules”).®

67. On 14 August 2012, Sanum Investments Limited, a LHNV subsidiary which operated the
Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, initiated its claim before the PCA for alleged violations of
the Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the

Government of The Lao People’s Democratic Republic Concerning the Encouragement

A. We - we started investing in Laos in 2007. Our initial commitment was a total of seven and a half million
dollars — my recollection is seven and a half million dollars paid to ST Group in various stages, and then the
next thing we invested in was getting new plans drawn and studies done for Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas.
Q. And in what year was that done?
A. That was done in 2008 primarily.
Q. When was the first monies paid? 2007 or 2008?
A. First monies, 2007.
Q. And then the money that was in 2008, can you say during roughly what month?
A. Well, the largest amount of money was paid prior to the Savan — was paid in probably the last six months
of 2008.
Q. During all of that time in 2007 and 2008, did you have a flat tax agreement yet?
A. Yes.
Q. Prior — let me show you some documents. Let me show you —
A. Well, we had an agreement to get the flat tax agreement. The flat tax was approved — the flat tax was
approved by Prime Minister Bouasone in [29 December 2008].

and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 31 January 1993 and the UNCITRAL

Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010.

While the proceedings before the two Tribunals are distinct and separate, the proceedings
were the subject of joint Hearings in Singapore and elsewhere. Accordingly, for ease of
reference only, LHNV and Sanum will be referred to as "the Claimants", as the facts of the
cases are intermingled. This terminology is not to suggest, however, that the two arbitral

proceedings are consolidated or otherwise conjoined.

3.3. Claims and Counterclaims

The Claimants’ original Treaty claims were based on a multiplicity of alleged treaty
breaches by the Government including (but not limited to) an 80% tax on casino revenues
and what the Claimants contended were unfair and oppressive audits of the Savan Vegas
Hotel and Casino. In addition, the Claimants alleged that the Government abused its
sovereign authority to assist ST Holdings to acquire other assets which belonged in whole
or in part, to the Claimants. In the Treaty proceedings, the Claimants eventually valued

their investment loss as of 31 August 2016 at between US $690 million and US $1 billion.”

3.4. The Settlement and its Aftermath

The Treaty claims were thought to have been resolved by a Deed of Settlement concluded
between the Parties during the merits Hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014 (to be read
together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to collectively as “the
Settlement”).

Shortly after the Settlement, the Claimants alleged that the Government had committed a
material breach of its terms, which entitled them to a revival of the Treaty arbitrations (“the
First Material Breach Application”). The Government contested jurisdiction. On 11

August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with the SIAC pursuant to

7 See Reports of Joseph P. Kalt dated 14 October 2016, 2 December 2016, 22 December 2016 and 15 March 2017.

paragraphs 35 and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum to comply with

its obligations under the Settlement.

The ICSID and PCA Tribunals held a hearing on 14 October 2014 in Washington, D.C. on
the objections to jurisdiction, which were dismissed. However, on 20 January 2015, the
High Court of the Republic of Singapore held that the PCA Tribunal did not possess subject
matter jurisdiction under the Laos-China BIT because of the status of Macau and issues of
state succession not here relevant, as well as the limitation in the BIT, according to which
“only disputes over the amount of compensation for expropriation can be submitted to
arbitration.”* The First Material Breach Application was dismissed on the merits by the
ICSID Tribunal on 10 June 2015. Subsequently, the judgment of the Singapore High Court
was reversed by the Court of Appeal of Singapore on 29 September 2016.”

3.5. Delimitation of the Relief Presently Sought by the Claimants

The Claimants’ Second Material Breach Application was successful, and on 15 December
2017, the Hearing on the merits of the “revived” claim was ordered to proceed. On 26
March 2018, the Claimants advised the Tribunal that they no longer sought relief in respect
of “Article 6 expropriation claim regarding the [Savan Vegas], its Article 6 expropriation
claim regarding Ferry Terminal or Lao Bao slot clubs [...], or its claims regarding

Respondent’s seizure of its bank account in breach of Articles 3(2), 3(4), 4, 5, and 6.”!°

The Claimants’ letter of 26 March 2018 notionally divided and separated their surviving
claims concerning LHNV (Thanaleng, Savan Vegas and the Ferry Terminal and Lao Bao
slots) and Sanum (Thanaleng, Paksan, Thakhet and Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino). As
mentioned, however, counsel for the Claimants asserted in the same letter that “the totality
of the facts remain relevant to certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants will seek
relief.” Equally, the Respondent conjoined its “clean hands” defence to all claims by both

Claimants at issue in the ICSID and PCA proceedings involving Mr. John Baldwin and the

8 Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic v. Sanum Investments Ltd., (2015] SGHC 15 at para. 128.

various interrelated allegations of bribery and corruption. Accordingly, it will be necessary
for the Tribunal to address “the totality” of the factual circumstances of the listed projects

of both Claimants insofar as they are relevant to the position of LHNV.

75. The Claimant maintained the expropriation claim pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty as

well as the following Treaty claims:

(a) denial of fair and equitable treatment and prohibitions on impairment by
unreasonable and discriminatory measures in respect of Savan Vegas, Thakhet,

Paksan, Thanaleng, Ferry Terminal and Lao Bao (Article 3(1) of the Treaty);

(b) breach of contractual obligations regarding Savan Vegas and Paksong Hotel and

Casino (Article 3(4) of the Treaty);

(c) national treatment regarding Savan Vegas, Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal (Articles

3(2) and 4 of the Treaty);

(d) Most Favoured Nation claims regarding Savan Vegas, Thanaleng, Ferry Terminal
and Lao Bao concerning full protection and security, most constant protection and

security and access to justice (Article 3(2) of the Treaty).
4, RELEVANT ARTICLES OF THE BIT
4.1. The Recitals
76. The Preamble to the Treaty provides, in its relevant part:

Desiring to strengthen their traditional ties of friendship and to extend and
intensify the economic relations between them, particularly with respect
to investments by the nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of
the other Contracting Party, recognizing that agreement upon the treatment
to be accorded to such investments will stimulate the flow of capital and
technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties and
that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable.

77. Article 2 of the Treaty provides:

Either Contracting Party shall, within the framework of its laws and
regulations, promote economic cooperation through the protection in its

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 89 of 457
28

territory of investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party. Subject
to its rights to exercise powers conferred by its laws or regulations, each
Contracting Party shall admit such investments.

78. Article 3(1), 3(2), 3(4), and 3(5) of the Treaty, in its relevant part, provide:

1) Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of
the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not
impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation,
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those
nationals. Each Contracting Party shall accord to such investments full
physical security and protection.

2) More particularly, each Contracting Party shall accord to such
investments treatment which in any case shall not be less favourable than
that accorded either to investments of its own nationals or to investments
of nationals of any third State, whichever is more favourable to the
national concerned.

3)...

4) Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have
entered into with regard to investments of nationals of the Other
Contracting Party.

5) If the provisions of law of either Contracting party or obligations under
international law existing at present or established hereafter between the
Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain a
regulation, whether general or specific, entitling investments by nationals
of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is
provided for by the present Agreement, such regulation shall, to the
extent that it is more favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.

(emphasis added)

79. Article 4 of the Treaty provides:

With respect to taxes, fees, charges and to fiscal deductions and
exemptions, each Contracting Party shall accord to nationals of the other
Contracting Party who are engaged in any economic activity in its
territory, treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own
nationals or to those of any third State who are in the same circumstances,
whichever is more favourable to the nationals concerned. For this purpose,
however, any special fiscal advantages accorded by that Party, shall not be
taken into account:

(a) under an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation; or

(b) by virtue of its participation in a customs union, economic union or
similar institution; or

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 90 of 457
29

(c) on the basis of reciprocity with a third State.
(emphasis added)

80. Article 6 of the Treaty provides:

Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or
indirectly, nationals of the other Contracting Party of their investments
unless the following conditions are complied with:

(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process
of law;

(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking
which the Contracting Party which takes such measures may have given;

(c) the measures are taken against just compensation. Such compensation
shall represent the genuine value of the investments affected, shall include
interest at a normal commercial rate until the date of payment and shall, in
order to be effective for the claimants, be paid and made transferable,
without delay, to the country designated by the claimants concerned and
in the currency of the country of which the claimants are nationals or in
any freely convertible currency accepted by the claimants.

(emphasis added)

81. Article 9 of the Treaty provides:

Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any legal dispute arising
between that Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting
Party concerning an investment of that national in the territory of the
former Contracting Party to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington on 18 March
1965, in the event that both Contracting Parties have become Contracting
States to the said Convention. In case a Contracting Party is not a
Contracting State to the said Convention, the disputes referred to above
shall be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes under the Rules Governing the Additional Facility for the
Administration of Proceedings by the Secretariat of the Centre (Additional
Facility Rules). A legal person which is a national of one Contracting Party
and which before such a dispute arises is controlled by nationals of the
other Contracting Party shall, in accordance with Article 25 (2) (b) of the
Convention, for the purpose of the Convention be treated as a national of
the other Contracting Party.

5. OTHER MATTERS

82.

83.

84.

85.

5.1. Other Legal Provisions

The Respondent argues that, in addition to the BIT, domestic law is relevant to the
existence of the Claimants’ contractual rights and the legality of the conduct of the foreign
investors. Furthermore, there are international norms such as “[t]he United Nations
Convention Against Corruption which defines bribery and money laundering as
fundamental criminal offenses that undermine the international system of foreign trade.”!!
It is the contention of the Respondent that the Claimants violated the BIT, the laws of Laos

and international norms.

According to the Claimant LHNV’s Reply, the “[BIT] clearly governs this dispute.”!? The
United Nations Convention Against Corruption (“UNCAC”) “creates obligations only for
the state Parties, to develop anti-corruption policies, practices, and task forces. It does not
bind or purport to bind the conduct of entities such as the Claimant.”!? The Claimants also
question the Respondent’s appeal to international public policy and, in particular, the
international standard for the gaming industry based on domestic gaming regulations of

just four jurisdictions, none of them applicable to the Claimants’ projects in Laos.

While the Claimants admit that domestic statutes obviously do determine whether certain
alleged acts are legal or illegal for the purposes of domestic law, domestic law does not

dictate the consequences for an investor’s claims under the Treaty.

The Claimants argue that “once an investor has established its investment in conformity
with the host state’s laws, that investment falls within the scope of the treaty (assuming all
of the other jurisdictional hurdles have been cleared), and the investor is prima facie

entitled to its protections.”'* The Claimants further argue that the cases that “consider

Reply”), para. -237.

whether allegations of misconduct constitute a proper defence on the merits do not assist
Laos because tribunals have required Respondents to demonstrate that the actions taken in

breach of the treaty were actually justified by the misconduct.”!>

86. | The Claimants also dispute the relevance of the “uncontroversial proposition that arbitral
tribunals have an inherent power to preserve the integrity of their own process ...”!° The
Claimants equally reject the applicability of the “unclean hands” doctrine and note that the
Respondent has not cited any case in which a tribunal has sanctioned post-investment

behavior with a full dismissal of the claimant’s case.

5.2. Tribunal’s Analysis

87. The law to be applied by the Tribunal is determined by the Treaty. The Treaty is an
international instrument that to the extent it requires interpretation will be interpreted by
the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
the Treaties (“VCLT”) to which both State parties to the Treaty have acceded. As the
Parties admit in their exchanges, the domestic law of the State may also be relevant. The
extent of its relevance is a matter of dispute between the Parties, particularly on the question
of whether to be protected an investment needs to be made and operated according to the
law of the host State. This issue and the disputed applicability of international policy relate
to the defence of illegal conduct and the Tribunal will address both matters as needed in its

consideration of the Respondent’s defence.

5.3. Clarification on the Nature of the Respondent’s Illegality Claims

88. As part of its defence, the Respondent has pleaded that the Tribunal should dismiss all
claims because of the illegal activities in which the Claimants allegedly engaged, including

bribery, embezzlement and money laundering. The Claimants have at times characterized

this defence as a “request for dismissal ... for lack of jurisdiction” because at inception or

in its operation the investment of the Claimants was illegal.!”

As the Tribunal understands it, the present submission of the Respondent to dismiss all
claims on grounds of illegality is not an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but an
affirmation of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider the claims on their merits which, the

Government says, ought to be dismissed because of the Claimants’ illegal conduct.

THE RESPONDENT’S THRESHOLD POSITION IS THAT THE CLAIMS OUGHT
NOT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY REASON OF THE CLAIMANTS’ BRIBERY AND
CORRUPTION
At the threshold of its argument, the Respondent contends that the claims should be
dismissed in their entirety, in part because of corruption in the creation of the investments,
and in part because of corruption in the course of performance of the various PDAs and

unsuccessful initiatives by the Claimants to obtain licences for new gambling facilities.

The Respondent alleges that the principals behind the Claimants, Mr. John Baldwin and
Mr. Sean Scott, were quite brazen about how to do business in a culture of corruption.
However, Mr. Baldwin says, they steadfastly resisted. In this respect, Mr. Baldwin testified
that:

Laos can be quite a corrupt country ... As I met fellow businessmen in

Laos, I came to realize that almost every major business operating in Laos

has paid money under the table for their concessions, or their flat tax
agreements or other Government approvals. Sanum, however, has not.'®

In his re-examination at the Hearing, Mr. John Baldwin made an even more emphatic
denial of corrupt activities: “I gave strict instructions always that we weren’t paying any

bribes.”!?

The allegations of bribery in the course of making the initial investment include:

(a) an alleged bribe of US $30,000 to Laotian tax authorities to obtain approval of the
original 2009 Flat Tax Agreement which the Claimants regarded as essential to

their investment in their flagship Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino project;

(b) payment of US $25,000 to Government officials to procure a licence for the

Claimants’ proposed Thakhaek Slot Club and Welcome Centre.”?

The allegations of bribery in the course of performance of the PDAs and related initiatives

include:

(a) payment of US $875,000 to the Claimants’ consultant in the Laos private sector,
Madam Sengkeo Phimmasone, to bribe Government officials to stop an audit by
Ernst & Young (“E&Y”) of Savan Vegas in order to avoid disclosure of the
Claimants’ illegal activity”! and witness tampering (Madam Sengkeo Phimmasone
refused to make herself available to testify in these proceedings. The Respondent

alleges she was paid by the Claimants to stay away);

(b) payment of bribes totalling US $ 21,000 in 2012 to Government officials in an effort

to obtain an extension of the 2009 Flax Tax Agreement;”?

Q. Mr. Branson asked you a number of questions about the contracts, the consulting contracts, that Mr.
Bouker had that Marty Gersten had written up and you said you hadn't seen them, but now that you've seen
them, do they cause you to believe that Mr. Bouker was being dispatched to go and bribe people?

A. No.

Q. And why is that?

A. Well, first and foremost, I gave strict instructions always that we weren't paying any bribes. That's
number one. I just don't do it and I'm a stubborn guy and I just don't — I tell my staff the same thing always,
you know, slippery slope and you can't start down it, so that's number one. But number two is, you
know, fair value [in terms of a success fee] for result for work given. I mean, if he [Mr. Bowker] has the
contacts to do this, more power to him. (empha: \dded)

In addition, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants paid US $120,000 to Cambodian
officials for a Cambodian lottery licence, bribed Cambodian officials to obtain Cambodian
diplomatic passports and bribed Cambodian customs officials to ignore unlawful border
crossings. These allegations were designed to demonstrate that the principals of the
Claimants are “bad people” with a predisposition to use bribery and corruption to advance
their financial interests. The facts underlying the Cambodian allegations are so far
removed from the allegations of corruption in Laos, that the allegations relating to

Cambodia are irrelevant and will not be considered further.

6.1. Evidence of Bribery and Corruption is Relevant in Respect of Criminality Both at
the Time of Investment and During Subsequent Performance

96. The Parties agree that investment tribunals are rightly sensitive to allegations of corruption.
They agree that the Respondent bears the burden of proof. They disagree on the standard
of proof, i.e. whether a balance of probabilities is sufficient or whether corruption must be
established to the more demanding standard of “clear and convincing evidence” of

corruption. They also, of course, disagree on the facts.

97. There is no doubt that bribery and corruption are contrary to the domestic laws of Laos.”

6.1.1. The Respondent’s Argument

98. The Respondent asserts that the Claimants are not legally entitled to maintain any of their
claims in these proceedings as a matter of ordre public international and public policy.*°
Corruption, the Respondent argues, is relevant to the initial investment but also to the

investor’s subsequent conduct in relation to the investment in the host country.*!

9 Lao Penal Code
Article 157:
Any person bribing or agreeing to bribe a civil servant shall be punished by six months to two years of imprisonment
and a fine equal to the amount or value of the bribe.
In the event of a substantial bribe, the bribed civil servant, the briber and the person who agrees to give the
bribe shall be punished by three to five years of imprisonment and fines equal to twice the amount or value
of the bribe.
Bribe intermediaries shall be punished by six months to two years of imprisonment and fines equal to the
amount or value of the bribe.

31. The approach to bribery is different in investment arbitrations, where jurisdiction does not derive from a
contract, but rather from an investment treaty. In these cases, validity of contracts is not the question. The

99. The difference is that corruption in the making of the investment will raise issues of
jurisdiction for the Tribunal, whereas subsequent acts of corruption will go to a claimant’s

entitlement for relief under the BIT.*?
100. In particular, the Respondent relies on the analysis in Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan:

While reaching the conclusion that the claims are barred as a result of
corruption, the Tribunal is sensitive to the ongoing debate that findings on
corruption often come down heavily on claimants, while possibly
exonerating defendants that may have themselves been involved in the
corrupt acts. It is true that the outcome in cases of corruption often appears
unsatisfactory because, at first sight at least, it seems to give an unfair
advantage to the defendant party. The idea, however, is not to punish one
party at the cost of the other, but rather to ensure the promotion of the rule
of law, which entails that a court or tribunal cannot grant assistance to a
party that has engaged in a corrupt act.** (emphasis added)

101. The Respondent also relies, more generally, on the doctrine of “clean hands”. The
Claimants’ misconduct is sufficient, it is said, to deny them the assistance of investor-state

arbitration.

6.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

102. The Claimants point out that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is founded on the BIT and neither
the Netherlands nor the Chinese BIT contains a provision authorizing a tribunal to deny
the treaty’s protection on the basis that the claimant/investor engaged in corruption. If the
BITs provide no authority to dismiss, the Tribunal would have to base its decision on

customary international law. However, the lack of “clean hands” is neither a recognized

 

ue is whether an investor who has incurred in corrupt practices when making or performing the investment
can still enjoy protection under the relevant investment treaty. And the answer is no. (38) Investment
arbitration has initiated and led the movement of zero tolerance towards corruption.
2 Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines, \CSID Case No. ARB/03/25, at
para. 345, LHRA-29:
If, at the time of the initiation of the investment, there has been compliance with the law of the host state,
allegations by the host state of violations of its law in the course of the investment, as a justification for
state action with respect to the investment, might be a defence to claimed substantive violations of the BIT,
but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its jurisdiction. (emphasis added)

tule of customary international law nor a general principle of international law and thus
34

 

affords no authority to dismiss.

103. The Claimants acknowledge that corruption in the establishment of an investment can
render a claim inadmissible because treaty protections are only available for valid
investments recognized under the treaty (based upon either an explicit or implied legality
requirement).*> The Claimants deny corruption but in any event deny any causal

connection between the acts of alleged corruption and these claims. The Respondent only

concocted its corruption allegations after the arbitrations were commenced and in any
event has failed to govern itself in a manner consistent with its international obligations,
including due process and good faith, and the prosecution of bribe-takers as well as alleged

bribe-givers.*°

104. The Claimants’ principal, Mr. John Baldwin, denied the applicability of the “red flags”

approach to the investments in issue here:

Q. Is it possible that when you enter into a consulting contract like this,
that if the event is achieved, the consultant is sent the money and the
consultant then is instructed to pay it to certain government ministers so
that it keeps the company one step removed from proof of the bribe? Isn’t
that how it works, Mr. Baldwin?

A. That’s a possibility, although it didn’t happen here.*”
6.1.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

105. The Tribunal considers that proof of corruption at any stage of the investment may be
relevant depending on the circumstances. While the UNCAC applies to States rather than

private parties, it embodies what has become a principle of customary international law

applicable, according to the OECD, to root out corruption used “to obtain or retain

business or other undue advantage in relation to the conduct of international business.”*

The Respondent also relies on a generalized doctrine of “clean hands” which is a metaphor
employed as a defence to equitable relief in common law jurisdictions. Incorporation of
such a general doctrine into investor-State law without careful boundaries would risk
opening investment disputes to an open-ended, vague and ultimately unmanageable
principle. However, putting aside the label, serious financial misconduct by the Claimants
incompatible with their good faith obligations as investors in the host country (such as
criminality in defrauding the host Government in respect of an investment) is not without
Treaty consequences, both in relation to their attempt to rely on the guarantee of fair and
equitable treatment, as well as their entitlement to relief of any kind from an international

tribunal.

6.2. The Applicable Standard of Proof
6.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

The Respondent notes that many international tribunals have recognized the difficulty of
“proving” bribery and corruption. In the nature of things, the parties to such transactions
are generally careful to leave no paper trail or other direct or documentary evidence. As a
result, if corruption is to be combatted effectively, it is necessary to rely on inferences from

circumstantial evidence. A reasonable approach is to identify “red flags” which, if

of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, Article 1(1), Exhibit LHRA-136:

See

Each Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish that it is a criminal offence under its
law for any person intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other advantage, whether
directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign public official, for that official or for a third party, in order
that the official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official duties, in order to obtain

established, require the alleged perpetrators to provide an exculpatory explanation of
otherwise suspicious conduct. In Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan,” for example, the tribunal
considered probative of corruption the Government’s evidence of substantial payments to

a consultant where:
(a) the consultant lacks experience in the sector,
(b) the consultant is not a resident of the country where the project is located;

(c) the consultant has no significant business presence or experience within the

country;
(d) the consultant requests “urgent” payments and/or unusually high commissions;

(e) the consultant requests payments be made in cash, be made in a third country, to a
numbered bank account, or to some other person or entity than the one with whom

the agreement was signed;

(f) the consultant has a close personal/professional relationship to the Government that

could improperly influence the decision.*°

6.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

108. The Claimants contend that the applicable standard of proof of corruption in international
law is “clear and convincing evidence” which must consist of “substantial facts” not mere

“inferences”! Relevance is placed on Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v.

The Arab Republic of Egypt, where the tribunal held that “the applicable standard of proof
is greater than the balance of probabilities but less than beyond a reasonable doubt.” The

term favoured by the Claimants is “clear and convincing evidence.” *”

6.2.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

The Tribunal acknowledges the difficulty of proving corruption as well as the importance
of exposing corruption where it exists. In the nature of the offence, the person offering the
bribe and the person accepting it will take care to cover their tracks. Nevertheless, given
the seriousness of the charge, and the severity of the consequences to the individuals
concerned, procedural fairness requires that there be proof rather than conjecture. The
standard of “probabilities” requires the trier of fact to stand back and make an overall
assessment. The requirement of “clear and convincing” evidence puts the focus more

closely on the building blocks of the evidence to ensure a rigorous testing.

In the Tribunal’s view there need not be “clear and convincing evidence” of every element
of every allegation of corruption, but such “clear and convincing evidence” as exists must
point clearly to corruption. An assessment must therefore be made of which elements of
the alleged act of corruption have been established by clear and convincing evidence, and
which elements are left to reasonable inference, and on the whole whether the alleged act
of corruption is established to a standard higher than the balance of probabilities but less
than the criminal standard of beyond reasonable doubt, although of course proof beyond a
reasonable doubt would be conclusive. This approach reflects the general proposition that

the graver the charge, the more confidence there must be in the evidence relied on.

6.3. Failure of the Respondent to Investigate and Prosecute Persons who Allegedly
Accepted Bribes

111. As the Claimants point out, the Respondent has brought no prosecutions against any
Government official said to be on the receiving end of the bribes. Nor is there before the
Tribunal any evidence of a serious criminal investigation of anyone other than the

principals of the Claimant, Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Sean Scott.

112. Conviction of its own officials would not estop the Government from pursuing the
Claimants as bribe-givers. However, in this case, the Tribunal finds it disturbing that no
prosecutions have been brought against any persons alleged to have accepted bribes, nor
has there been evidence of due diligence in any investigation. These omissions are relevant

to the credibility of the Government’s allegations, as will be seen.

6.3.1. First Allegation — Bribes to Obtain the 2009 Flat Tax Agreement

6.3.1.1. The Respondent’s Argument

113. The Claimants have repeatedly acknowledged that the Flat Tax Agreement (“FTA”) was
essential to the economic profitability of Savan Vegas. Mr. John Baldwin testified in
Singapore that the Claimants would not have built the casino without an FTA:

Q. And would you have built the Savan Vegas casino for $25 million, $30

million if that was the tax you had to pay, if the government refused to

give you a flat tax agreement?

A. No.
114. It is alleged that to obtain the original 2009 FTA, a bribe of US $30,000 was paid to Ms.
Manivone or Mr. Khamphai, senior officials with the Government tax department, through

the Claimants’ intermediary or consultant, Madam Sengkeo.

The FTA was of great value to the Claimants as it limited most types of tax to a flat sum
of US $745,000 per year regardless of the profits made by the multi-million-dollar casino

operation.

The chronology is as follows:

DATE ACTIVITY

29 December 2008 Prime Minister approves FTA in principle

21 September 2009 Flat Tax Agreement signed.

22 September 2009 Internal Sanum e-mail records that Mr. Khamphai requested

wire of “agreed payment” to Madam Sengkeo’s account
“approved” by Mr. Baldwin.*°

24 September 2009 Internal Sanum e-mail records that the “tax people are
requesting [...] $30,000 USD [...] to get the flat tax
approval.”47

7 October 2009 Internal Sanum e-mail records that Madam Sengkeo “has

provided her daughter’s bank account” information.**

8 October 2009 Internal Sanum e-mail records that Mr. Baldwin instructed the
disbursement of funds “by wire” for “service[s] partially

rendered”. Amounts of $10,000 and $20,000 were disbursed

from the account “by wire”.””

According to the Respondent, the sequence of dates, and the use of the daughter’s bank

account in lieu of Madam Sengkeo’s own account, raise “red flags”.

While the FTA had been agreed to in principle in December 2008, Mr. John Baldwin
testified that the deal was not done, because “we needed to get the flat tax agreement

reduced into a formal document at that specific time.”*° Accordingly, it would have been

substance of that agreement?

119.

43

quite understandable for the payment of a bribe to be delayed until October 2009 when the
FTA was signed, as opposed to December 2008 when it was purportedly approved in

principle by the Government.

In cross-examination, Mr. John Baldwin denied any illegal payment to Madam Sengkeo
but according to the Respondent, Mr. Baldwin’s explanation that the reference to payment
in October 2009 of US $30,000 to the “tax people” meant payment to Madam Sengkeo for
her own benefit rather than as a bribe for tax officials is (according to the Respondent)
manifestly absurd. In this respect, Mr. John Baldwin testified as follows:

Q. Isn’t this a statement to the CFO of Sanum/Savan Vegas to pay a bribe

of $30,000 to a tax official in the Ministry of Finance?

A. No.

Q. How do you interpret it? What does it mean?

A. That the $30,000 success fee was supposed to be paid to Madam
Sengkeo and her tax people that were with her.

Q. She is “the Tax people”?

A. Yes.

Q. Did she work for the government then?

A. No.

Q. She didn’t? She’s not an employee of the Ministry of Finance?

A. No.*!

A. I believe — I —I don't know specifically, but I believe that we needed to get the flat tax agreement reduced
into a formal document at that specific time, but Madam Sengkeo's engagement went back nearly a year, is
my recollection, and that she helped, through that whole period, to get the flat tax agreement.

Q. What was the agreement? Why was she getting 30,000? Why not 50,000?

A. Well, she agreed to take $30,000.

120. The Respondent adds that the US $30,000 may have gone to Madam Sengkeo in the first
instance, but in the Respondent’s view, the coincidence of timing with Sanum’s apparent

need to ingratiate itself with Government officials is fatal to Mr. Baldwin’s credibility.

6.3.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

121. The Claimants contend that payment of US $30,000 to Madam Sengkeo was a “success
fee” for obtaining the FTA where previous intermediaries had failed.°* Mr. Baldwin

strongly denied any impropriety:

Q. Down at the bottom of the page it says:

“Dear Billy and Team, Mr Khamphai of the Tax Department and Mdm
Sengkeo had just informed us that Joe had picked up the flat tax document
at his office [meaning Mr Khamphai’s] since 9AM this morning...

However, he has asked us to wire the agreed payment to Madam
Sengkeo’s account as followed...”

And then they give the account number. So isn’t this interesting, that the
day that the flat tax agreement is delivered to your employee, he asked that
$30,000 is wired that day?

A. Well, my reading of this is that “he” is Joe.
Q. And who is he saying that the money should be paid to?

A. Madam Sengkeo.*? (emphasis added)

* Mr. Baldwin testified in his Second Witness Statement in the SIAC case of 8 June 2015 as follows:
15. The Government alleges that I authorized payments totaling US $30,000 to Madame Sengkeo
Phimmasone, as a bribe to obtain the flat tax agreement issued on | September 2009 for Savan Vegas. This
too is false. The payments represented a success fee to Madam Sengkeo for her efforts to help Savan
Vegas negotiate a Flat Tax Agreement with the Lao Government — a project on which she had worked since
at least July 2008.
16. Initially, it was the ST Group — then our local partner in Laos — that was responsible for obtaining a flat
tax agreement for Savan Vegas. However, it failed to do so, thus by mid-2008, we took it upon ourselves to
negotiate such an agreement with the Lao Government. In order to have local Lao expertise to assist us,
Savan Vegas offered a success fee to Madam Sengkeo to lobby for a satisfactory Flat Tax Agreement for
Savan Vegas. Madam Sengkeo was a partner of ST, which is how I came to know her. I discovered that she
had many high-level connections in the Lao Government. This made her a natural choice for this consulting
engagement. (emphasis added)

Mr. John Baldwin testified that there was no reason to bribe any Government employee in
September 2009 as the Prime Minister had already agreed to a flat tax agreement in

December 2008.*4

6.3.1.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

The Respondent’s case is speculative rather than substantial. Madam Sengkeo was in the
consulting business. Consultants are paid. While the Claimants never produced a
“consulting agreement” with Madam Sengkeo, the evidence is that it is not unusual for
consultants to insist on a success fee as part of their remuneration. The effort to obtain an
FTA was successful. It was likely worth millions of dollars to the Claimants in reduced
taxes. In that context, payment of US $30,000 in 2009 is not a disproportionate “success
fee”. Moreover, no one was prosecuted in this affair. Even if Madam Sengkeo did not
cooperate with the Government, why was her daughter (the owner of the bank account) not
investigated? What is the daughter’s explanation? The evidence of corruption in this
instance is neither clear nor convincing. The bribery allegation in connection with the FTA

is not established to the necessary standard for such a serious charge.

6.3.2. Second Allegation — Bribes to Extend the Flat Tax Agreement After Expiry of
the 5-Year Term

6.3.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

On 18 March 2011, Savan Vegas submitted its proposal to extend the FTA, which was due
to expire on 31 December 2014. Six days later, on 24 March 2011, the Claimants paid
US $21,000 to Mr. Bouker Noutharath, a retired hospital worker from Olympia,

Washington State, United States of America, who had returned to live in Laos. He had no

*4 Mr. Baldwin testified:
Q. Would there be any reason to have to bribe anyone when the Prime Minister had already approved your
flat tax?
A. You know, there's no reason to and, plus, obviously, the Prime Minister's office was watching this. The
local tax people were watching this, the finance department's watching this. This was a significant project
and lots of people were watching it and there's no way. You just wouldn't — couldn't happen.

experience as a “consultant” but had good contacts within the Government. On 4 March
2011, he was retained by Savan Vegas” as a consultant to lobby in favour of an extension
of the FTA. Mr. Baldwin says Mr. Bouker was promised a success fee substantially in
excess of US $21,000, but Mr. Bouker, who agreed to cooperate with the Government,

testified that:

Ihave seen the entry in the general ledger that I was sent $21,000 on March
24, 2011. The entry says “prof fee re flat tax acceptance — Brian
Nonthavet.” RE-131. I remember that Sanum was concerned about
extending a flat tax agreement, but I was not involved in that issue. I was
sent the $21,000 to deliver it to a government person. I remember it
was Mr. Paoa [of Savan Vegas] who asked me to make this payment about
the tax issue but I cannot remember the name of the Government
person who I gave this payment too.*° (emphasis added)

These contracts are for fraud reasons. They were drafted and sent to me
by lawyer Martin Gersten...They were to provide a cover for the bribes

Sanum intended to pay to have the Government extend the Flat Tax
Agreement and to obtain the Thakhaek slot club licence.*”

125. The Respondent believes the unidentified “Government Person” was Ms. Manivone but

Mr. Baldwin testified he was “sure” this was not so:

Q. Do you know that at the time you were negotiating with Madam
Manivone in the tax department of the Ministry of Finance?

A. Well, we were — negotiated with Madam Manivone from 2007 clear
through, you know, into 2012.

Q. Isn’t it true that Mr Paoa asked Bouker to deliver $21,000 [in 2012] to
Ms Manivone in the tax department to help in negotiations for the flat tax
agreement?

A. I don’t think so.

Q. But you’re not sure?

A. I’m sure...
6.3.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

Mr. Bouker received a legitimate consulting mandate. By e-mail dated 21 March 2011, he
requested US $21,000 as “an advance”. His bank records do not show a withdrawal of
US $21,000 but withdrawals of three different amounts on 28 March (US $9,500 cash), 30
March (US $9,000 to his son) and 4 April (US $2,135 cash). Mr. Bouker is a dissatisfied

former employee whose testimony is not credible.

6.3.2.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

There are inconsistencies in Mr. Bouker’s evidence and it is significant that he can
remember nothing about (or is otherwise unwilling to identify) “the Government Person”
to whom he said he handed US $21,000. There are too many loose ends to his story. There
is no evidence that Madam Manivone (the presumed recipient) or anyone else was
prosecuted. In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s evidence does not establish by clear
and convincing evidence that a US $21,000 bribe was offered by Mr. Bouker to any

Government official as alleged.

6.3.3. Third Allegation — The Claimants Paid US $500,000 in Bribes in 2012 to (i)
Shut Down the E&Y Audit of Savan Vegas and (ii) to Cause the Government to
Shut Down the Thanaleng Slot Club to the Disadvantage of ST Holdings

On 8 July 2012, Mr. Baldwin wired Sanum’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Clay Crawford,
that “Savan has an extraordinary expense of $500,000 this week. I’ve tell you about it

when we speak on the phone, but please think about our cash situation.”*?

129. Mr. Baldwin accepts that the sum of US $500,000 was subsequently sent to Vientiane
including US $300,000 cash in a backpack delivered to Madam Sengkeo by his personal

assistant, Bruce Douglas.

6.3.3.1. The E&Y Audit

130. Mr. Baldwin acknowledges ordering Mr. Douglas, to fly to Vientiane with US $300,000
cash. It is established that US $300,000 was subsequently deposited in Madam Sengkeo’s
bank account. She subsequently deposited US $30,000 in her bank account in New York.

131. The Respondent’s allegation is that the balance of US $270,000 was paid by Madam

  

Sengkeo to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of the Savan Vegas which Mr.

Baldwin considered part of a Government move to get rid of Sanum and take over the

Claimants’ gambling assets without compensation.*!

...“Even those few Government officials who will still speak with me have admitted that we have been the
target of a deliberate campaign to strip Sanum of its investments in Laos. The objective of these efforts
appears to be to leave the successful businesses, in which we invested so much and which we spent years
developing, in the hands of our local commercial partner, the ST Group...and the senior Lao Government
officials who have intimate business and familial connections with ST.”

6.3.3.1.1. The Respondent’s Argument

The Respondent points out that the alleged “loan” to Madam Sengkeo was
undocumented.® Only US $15,000 has been repaid. Mr. Baldwin acknowledges that
Madam Sengkeo has not been asked by the Claimants to repay the balance. The
US $30,000 deposit in New York was 10% of the US $300,000 transfer. Madam Sengkeo
was a “ten percenter”, and her receipt of US $30,000 indicates that bribes of US $270,000

were paid.

The bribe succeeded, according to the Respondent. On 12 July 2012, Ernst & Young was
ordered by unidentified Government officials to stop work on its audit of Savan Vegas.

The E&Y audit would have disclosed the Claimants’ illegal activities (subsequently

uncovered by a BDO audit after the Government ousted the Claimants from the casino)

including (the Government alleges) embezzlement and money laundering.

6.3.3.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

The Claimants say the US $300,000 was a “loan” to Madam Sengkeo. The New York
deposits are unrelated. Madam Sengkeo was closely involved with ST Holdings. There
had been a falling out. She thus had an “urgency” for funds when ST Holdings

65

malevolently cut off Madam Sengkeo’s regular source of income.® Mr. Baldwin was a

loyal friend.

6.3.3.1.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

Mr. Baldwin’s explanation of the US $300,000 payment to Madam Sengkeo is not credible.
It is clear on the evidence that Mr. Baldwin and his CFO, Mr. Clay Crawford, were
concerned about the threat to Sanum’s business posed by the E&Y audit. Mr. Baldwin had
every incentive to influence the Government to call off the E&Y audit in the summer of
2012. It is simply not plausible, as the Claimants argue, that the E&Y audit was stopped
because Government officials had concluded that E&Y had failed to find incriminating
evidence. If that were true, the obvious instructions from the Government to E&Y would

have been to keep digging not to give up and down tools.

On the other hand, the Claimants had a powerful motive to stop the audit as Mr. Baldwin
and Mr. Crawford knew (and the Government merely suspected) of the existence of
financial skeletons in the Savan Vegas books later uncovered by the BDO audit. All in all,

the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants got a senior Government official to stop the audit

Q. What was going on in Vientiane in July 2012 that you needed all that cash there except the Thanaleng
case was happening about 10 days later and the E&Y audit was terminated the day before. Those are the two
events that I can think of that related to Savan Vegas, what can you think of?

A. ST had cut Madame Sengkeo off from any income from their investments, because she had helped
us over him, he had cut her off from any money and she lives primarily on money from him. She
needed money to pay bills on the hotel she was building. The USD $300,000 is a loan to her. (emp!

51

and that the $270,000 was paid through Madam Sengkeo (i.e. $300,000 less 10%) to that

Government person or persons.

That said, the Tribunal is troubled by the fact that the Government has apparently not
identified any bribe-takers. The order to E&Y to stop the audit came as a surprise to E&Y
and must have been issued by a senior Government source, otherwise the audit would have
continued. The Respondent does not suggest that E&Y took the bribe but E&Y must
know who gave its auditors the order to stop work. The evidentiary trail could then
have been followed up the chain of command from the Government person who gave the
order to identify the person who authorized the order, who could then have been required
to provide the Government (and subsequently the Tribunal) with an explanation for the

stop work order.

The Respondent has not offered any explanation for this gap in the evidence. In the
circumstances, while the evidence of Mr. Baldwin that Madam Sengkeo required the funds
for her personal use is deeply unsatisfactory, so too is the Government’s apparent failure
even to attempt (so far the evidence is concerned) to get to the bottom of the matter, not
only potentially to punish the wrongdoers, but to provide solid evidence that a bribe was

given and taken by Government official(s) to stop the E&Y audit.

The Tribunal concludes that it is more probable than not that Madam Sengkeo was used as
a conduit to bribe Government officials to stop the E&Y audit, but that this conclusion is
not established to the higher standard of “clear and convincing evidence”. The Tribunal is
satisfied, however, on the lesser standard of probabilities, that Mr. Baldwin involved the

Claimants in serious financial illegalities in respect of the halt of the E&Y audit.

6.3.3.2. Payment of About US $200,000 in Bribes to Shut Down the Thanaleng
Slot Club

In 2012, the Claimants were experiencing tense relations with their then Laotian partner,

ST Holdings. In part, the tensions related to a profitable slot club at Thanaleng, which ST

Holdings agreed to joint venture with Sanum. The joint venture was to commence at a

future date awaiting the expiry of an earlier arrangement ST Holdings had contracted with

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 113 of 457
52

a different slot machine supplier. However, when the date for the change-over arrived, ST

Holdings refused to proceed with its deal with Sanum.

141. Mr. Baldwin is alleged to have then paid bribes to Government officials through a
“consultant”, Mr. Anousith Thepsimuong, in an effort to shut down the Thanaleng Slot
Club as a pressure tactic to force ST Holdings to negotiate a solution rather than continue

with litigation (which the Claimants ultimately lost in the Laotian Courts).

6.3.3.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

142. On 28 July 2012, during the corporate struggle over the Thanaleng Slot Club, the Claimants
attempted to obtain leverage over ST Holdings by bribing Government Ministries to shut
down the Club. The money was channelled through Mr. Anousith. The sum of US
$190,000 was deposited in Mr. Anousith’s bank account on 11 July 2012 and a cash
withdrawal of US $100,000 was made the following day.

143. Mr. Baldwin testified that Mr. Anousith was paid to lobby “the National Assembly” but
this explanation is not credible. The National Assembly has no executive function. Only
a Government Minister would have operational authority to issue a stop order against the

Thanaleng Slot Club.

144. Mr. Baldwin acknowledged that he could not explain how or why the National Assembly
would get involved in such an executive action:
Q. You say that the National Assembly is going to suspend a licence, but

did he [the Deputy Prime Minister] ever explain or did you ever find out
how the National Assembly would actually do that?

A. No.”

6.3.3.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

Mr. John Baldwin readily admits that in July 2012 he was doing what was possible to get
the Government to close the Thangaleng Slot Club," including by a written submission to
the country’s President. The Claimants say there is no reason to disbelieve Mr. Baldwin’s

evidence that he was told by the Deputy Prime Minister to lobby the country’s National

Assembly.°?
146. Mr. Baldwin denied that money was intended for a Government Minister:

Q. See, that brings us back to July and this $500,000 pot of money that we
have sitting in Vientiane in Madam Sengkeo’s bank account — her son-in-
law’s bank account. Isn’t it true that that money was there to stop the court
case from having a judgment — the money was there so you could get the
slot club shut down and negotiate with Mr Sithat?

A. The money was specifically earmarked to do lobbying with the
National Assembly.

Q. Well, we just established that you have a good friend who is the
fourth most powerful person in the country. Wasn’t the money for him
to shut down the club so you could stop the court decision?

68 Mr. Baldwin testified that he wrote to President Choummaly Sayasone requesting the Government to shut down the

Thangaleng Slot Club:
“Sanum asks that the Government suspend that the slot machine licence at the Vientiane Friendship Bridge.
We believe that a temporary suspension will encourage the parties to negotiate and come to terms so they
can work together. Once the parties have reached an agreement, formed a joint venture that is approved by
the relevant ministries, and determine that they can operate the Vientiane...Bridge Slot Club together, the
licence would be reinstated. Until then, Sanum requests your assistance in suspending the licence and
allowing time and space to work [together] towards peace with [the] ST Group.” Correct? So, as I said, you
were trying to get a space to negotiate your way out of this trouble with ST.
A. Yes.

Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 7, 19-25 to p. 8, I-11.

© In re-examination, Mr. Baldwin testified about the National Assembly as follows:
MS DEITSCH-PEREZ: You spoke with Mr Branson about the Thanaleng lobbying. Can you tell us where
you first got the idea to lobby the assembly with respect to Thanaleng?
A. Yeah. I was having breakfast with Deputy Prime Minister Somsavath — we were having oatmeal — and
he —I said I got — I have to get — make peace with Sithat somehow and I — how do we do it and he said, you
know, it's a tough row, because, you know, he's joined at the hip with Bounnhang — you know, with vice-
president Vorachith, Bounnhang Vorachith, and he said I — there's not very many people that are going to be
able to help you with this, you've got to make peace with Sithat and Vorachith, so I said, “Well, who can help
me do that?”, and he said, “Well, two places — the politburo and the National Assembly”, and he said the
politburo, “That's difficult, so I would suggest that you reach out to the National Assembly.”

A. No.” (emphasis added)

147. The Claimants argue that there is no evidence that Mr. Anousith paid money to any
Government official. He received fees as a consultant to lobby the National Assembly to
shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club. He was entitled to spend that money as he wished.
Laos is a cash economy. Payment of large amounts of cash in respect of legitimate

7!

transactions is not unusual.'' Cash does not signal illegality.

6.3.3.2.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

148. Once again, the payment to Mr. Anousith is deeply suspicious. There is no documentation
of any consultancy. There is no explanation of the work for which almost $200,000 were
paid to him and deposited in his personal bank account. The mandate to lobby the
“National Assembly” seems far-fetched. Moreover, despite the alleged payment of bribes,
the Thanaleng Slot Club was not shut down. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable
to find “clear and convincing evidence” that a bribe was made or even offered through Mr.
Anousith. However, on the lower “probabilities” standard, the Tribunal concludes that it
is more likely than not that a bribe was paid to an unidentified Government official or
officials in an unsuccessful effort to advance the Claimants’ agenda at the Thanaleng Slot

Club.

6.3.4. Fourth Allegation — The Claimants Arranged for a Further US $575,000
Transfer to Madam Sengkeo to Prevent Her from Testifying in These
Proceedings

In 2014, when the initial phase of these proceedings was pending, the Government sought
to have Madam Sengkeo testify. To that end, she was provided with a written assurance
of immunity dated 7 May 2014, if she provided “information and documents related to
offering of bribery to government of [sic] official(s) who were performing accounting audit

activities at Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd.”””

At a pre-hearing conference on 14 May 2014, the Claimants (amongst other matters)
applied to the Tribunal to allow Mr. Baldwin to make a “personal loan” to Madam Sengkeo
of US $575,000.”> Given the importance and sensitivity of Madam Sengkeo’s evidence
potentially to be given at the merits Hearing, the Tribunal declined to give its permission

for a US $575,000 loan to her from Mr. Baldwin.

The initial Hearing on the merits proceeded in Singapore in June 2014. Madam Sengkeo

did not attend to testify for the Government.

or the third party “loan” of US $575,000 of May 2014, being a total of US $875,000 has
been repaid except for US $15,000, leaving US $860,000 not accounted for.”°

6.3.4.2. The Claimant’s Argument

153. | Mr. Baldwin had a long-standing business relationship with Madam Sengkeo which, over
time, developed into personal friendship. It was perfectly normal for Madam Sengkeo to
seek a personal loan and for Mr. Baldwin to arrange it. There is no evidence whatsoever
that the loan of US $575,000 or any part thereof was intended by Mr. Baldwin, or
understood by Madam Sengkeo, as an inducement not to testify. Madam Sengkeo,”” who
now lives outside Laos, was being improperly pressured by the Government to give false

evidence to support its bribery and corruption case”® and it is therefore quite understandable

Exhibit LHRE-163:

Q. Has Ms. Sengkeo paid any of that money back?

A. I don’t know.

Q. It means that, as we sit here today, that you lent her 300,000, Mr. Morris, Mr. McCain’s colleagues lent

her 575, that’s $875,000. Has she paid you back?

A. She paid me back 500,000 baht.

Q. That’s 15,000 US?

A. Baht money.
77 Mr. Baldwin testified to his friendship as follows:

  

...but my friendship with Madam Sengkeo is — is - I mean, Madam Sengkeo and I had a great relationship.
I mean, it wasn't - she is my friend. I mean, she - we went to many, many, many dinners. I hung out with
her family. We — you know, she's my friend. I mean, there was nothing untoward about my business
relationships with her.

Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 38, 12-20.

78 Mr. John Baldwin testified in re-examination:

Q. What else did you hear from Peep about Madam Sengkeo's situation?

A. Madam Sengkeo has been under — it's been — what I've been told is that Madam Sengkeo has been under
a great deal of pressure by the government of Lao to sign documents making allegations that were not true
and she has been very worried about the consequences of this on not only just her economic state, her property
holdings and even her personal safety —

JUDGE BINNIE: When you say you have been told, who told you?

A. Peep. Peep told me, and the — madam — Peep [Sanum employee] has expressed to me that Madam Sengkeo
has expressed to her that she just feels there's an enormous amount of pressure and an enormous amount of
personal harm that she is subject to if she doesn't do everything the government asks her to, whether it's true
or not. It's there — she says it's been stressed to her it doesn't matter that it's true; she needs to help the
government of Lao in their efforts.

that she wished to avoid being a witness. Mr. Baldwin’s explanation of the loans to Madam

Sengkeo is not rebutted and there is no evidence inconsistent with his version of events.

6.3.4.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

154. |The US $575,000 loan, coming on top of the previous loan of US $300,000, of which only
US $15,000 were repaid bristles with “red flags”. Mr. Baldwin clearly intended to sidestep
the Tribunal’s denial of permission by arranging for the US $575,000 loan from a third
party. Given Madam Sengkeo’s central role in dealings between the Claimants and the
Government over many years, her testimony would have shed crucial light on the legality

or illegality of many of the disbursements at issue in the Respondent’s allegations.
155. Mr. John Baldwin testified:

Q. So when Mdm Sengkeo withdrew US $80,000 in cash on July 20,
the day before you went to visit your good friend, the Deputy Prime
Minister, what do you think she was going to do with those US dollars?

A. It was Mdm Sengkeo’s money to do what she wanted. She represented
to me that she needed the loan to pay construction bills.” (emphasis
added)

156. It cannot be said that the bare payment of US $875,000 to Madam Sengkeo is “clear and
convincing evidence” of bribery. There is no evidence to contradict Mr. Baldwin’s
evidence of her need for funds. There are other possible explanations for their

disbursement.

157. On the whole, however, while the Tribunal is unable to find “clear and convincing
evidence” that the money was paid to Madam Sengkeo to bribe Government Ministers, the
Tribunal is nevertheless satisfied on the lower standard of balance of probabilities that Mr.
Baldwin and Madam Sengkeo were involved in channeling funds illicitly to Lao
Government officials, and further that she was paid to secure her loyalty and to avoid her

testifying on behalf of the Government, thereby obstructing justice.

The coincidence of the timing of “loans” of US $875,000 (less one repayment of US
$15,000) to Madam Sengkeo and the Claimants’ urgent need for Government intervention
on its behalf at critical junctures of its business (the termination of the E&Y audit and the
attempt to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club), together with Madam Sengkeo’s role as
the Claimants’ principal go-between with the Government, which Mr. Baldwin describes
as a corrupt Government, compels an inference of Mr. Baldwin’s unlawful conduct and
through Mr. Baldwin, the culpability and bad faith of both LHNV and Sanum, on whose
behalf he acted.

The Government’s failure to track down bribe-takers or to provide a convincing
explanation of its efforts (even if on occasion unsuccessful) to do so, tells against the
Government’s case, although the fact that the key witness, Madam Sengkeo, herself refused

to cooperate made the Government’s task more difficult.

Possibly the Government prefers to spare itself some embarrassment by declining to put

whatever it knows about “bribe-takers” into the record of the Tribunal.

Be that as it may be, the circumstances disclosed to the Tribunal do not rise to the level of

“clear and compelling evidence” of corruption.

However, the Tribunal’s conclusion that corruption of Government officials is established
to the lower standard of “balance of probabilities” is relevant to the issue of the Claimants’
good faith and the legitimacy of the Claimants’ alleged “legitimate” expectations of fair

and “equitable” treatment. This issue is dealt with below.

6.3.5. Fifth Allegation — Bribery Scheme in June 2015 to Restore Control of Savan
Vegas to the Claimants

163. The Respondent seized control of the Savan Vegas and gambling facilities on 15 April
2015. Its right to do so was eventually confirmed by an arbitral tribunal constituted under

the SIAC by its Award dated 29 June 2017.°°

164. Prior to the SIAC Award, however, the Claimants asserted a right under the 2014

Settlement to take back control*! on the basis they had managed to sell their investments

on the open market prior to the 15 April 2015 deadline imposed as a term of the Settlement
with the Government. The allegedly genuine third-party offer to purchase dated 14 April
2015 was from an entity called MaxGaming Consulting Services Limited (Macau)
(“MaxGaming”).*? Its CEO, Mr. Angus Noble, represented in writing that MaxGaming
had funds available to complete the transaction and intended to do so.** In testimony before
the SIAC tribunal in January 2017, Angus Noble acknowledged that these representations

were false.** He repeated this retraction to this Tribunal at the Hearing. The MaxGaming

transaction did not proceed and was found by the SIAC tribunal to be a sham.*> Having
heard Mr. Noble’s evidence, this Tribunal also concludes that the 14 April 2015 offer was

asham. Indeed Mr. Noble more or less concedes that it was a sham.

6.3.5.1. The Respondent’s Argument

165. The MaxGaming offer was a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by the Claimants in order to
regain control of Savan Vegas*® from the Government. The Claimants had every interest
in pre-empting the Government’s seizure of Savan Vegas and putting a halt to the
Government’s access to the books of Savan Vegas and records targeted by a Government
audit into alleged wrongdoing at Savan Vegas including money laundering and

embezzlement.

6.3.5.2. The Claimant’s Argument

166. While unrealistic, Mr. Noble genuinely believed he could orchestrate the purchase, which

he testified was, for him, “the chance of a lifetime.”

6.3.5.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

and chicanery, is not established.

6.3.6. Sixth Allegation — Miscellaneous Acts of Bribery and Corruption
168. Other allegations of bribery and corruption were made:

(a) offer of a US $7 million bribe to the Prime Minister of Laos for approval of a licence

to establish a casino in the capital city of Vientiane;*’

(b) a bribe of US $80,000 to the Governor of the Province of Champasak to approve a
slot club at Chong Mek;*® and

(c) bribes totalling US $106,000 to Government officials to enable the opening and

continued operation of the Paksan Slot Club.*®

There is no “clear and convincing” evidence against the Claimants in support of any of

these additional claims of bribery and corruption.

169. As the Claimants point out, the Respondent has identified only two possible Government
bribe takers, namely Mr. Bounnong (but there is no indication he has been investigated)
and Madam Manivone. The evidence is that Madam Manivone was put under investigation
only after refusing to testify for the Respondent.” The Claimants state that on 29 May
2014, the Respondent promised its Rejoinder would reveal the results of its investigation.

It did not.

170. The Claimants complain, rightly, that the Respondent’s failure to offer any credible
explanation for not pursuing the investigation of its own employees, or indeed even to
attempt to identify the alleged bribe-takers, weighs against the credibility of these

miscellaneous allegations.”!

Nevertheless, in the Tribunal’s view, none of these additional allegations is supported by

sufficient evidence to warrant further inquiry or comment.
THE CLAIM FOR EXPROPRIATION
7.1, Thanaleng Slot Club

711. Background

At its origin, the dispute underlying the Thanaleng claim is a contractual dispute between
two private parties, Sanum and ST. They had signed a Master Agreement on 30 May
2007, where they agreed “to negotiate and work towards entering into certain joint
ventures, represented by necessary agreements, which shall convey 60% of all 2"! Party’s
[ST] gaming businesses located in the country of Lao PDR ... This Agreement is not
intended to be a definitive agreement but only provides the Parties’ general understandings
of their relationship. The Parties agree to work together in good faith to negotiate and
finalize all necessary agreement to fully implement the concept and terms set forth in this
Agreement.”*? The Respondent’s treatment of the Thanaleng situation is part of the
“totality of the facts” said by counsel for the Claimants to be relevant to LHNV’s Treaty

claims.

On 4 October 2008, Sanum and ST signed a Participation Agreement for Thanaleng
(“Participation Agreement”). Under this agreement, Sanum agreed to supply to ST

certain slot machines, on a “generated revenue sharing/participation basis.”°? This

116. Although the Tribunal believes Minister Sultan’s testimony that he was not personally aware that “Mr.
Kandil was an agent to Farargy” and that when he did learn about it, “I passed that to the prosecutor requesting
a full-fledged investigation”, it is undisputed that Mr. Kandil was never prosecuted in Egypt in connection
with this agreement. Regrettably, because Egypt has failed to present the Tribunal with any information
about the investigation requested by Minister Sultan, the Tribunal does not know whether an investigation
was conducted and, if so, whether the investigation was closed because the prosecutor determined that Mr.
Kandil was innocent, because of lack of evidence, or because of complicity by other government officials.
Nevertheless, given the fact that the Egyptian government was made aware of this agreement by Minister
Sultan but decided (for whatever reasons) not to prosecute Mr. Kandil, the Tribunal is reluctant to immunize
Egypt from liability in this arbitration because it now alleges that the agreement with Mr. Kandil was illegal
under Egyptian law.

agreement was meant to expire on 11 October 2011 when an existing contract of ST with
another supplier of slot machines expired. As explained by Sanum, “the expiration of the
Participation [Agreement] is only the end of percentage of profit distribution and
proportion of shareholding of each party in the business participation of the Slot Club,
which shifted from ST Group who used to receive 60% to receive 40% instead, and Sanum
who used to receive 40% to receive 60%, and at the same time (after 11 October 2011)
there shall change or create a joint venture company of which Sanum holds 60% and ST

Group 40%.”°4

174. | The controversy arose because Sanum and ST disagreed on whether the Master Agreement
remained in force and was valid and created binding obligations on the parties, despite the
expiration of the Participation Agreement. Was the Participation Agreement a temporary
agreement just to cover the period of time when other slot machine supplier agreements
were in place? Once those slot machine supplier contracts expired, did the Master
Agreement and other agreements referenced above remain in effect and control the

contractual relationship between Sanum and the ST Group?”

7.1.2. The Parties’ Arguments

175. The Claimants argue that they were deprived of their investment by flawed court
proceedings tainted by interference by the Respondent and without payment of
compensation. The Claimants summarize the measures for which they seek relief as
follows: “Beginning with premature termination of the OEDR proceedings on orders from
the Minister of Justice, and police participation in Sanum’s eviction from the Thanaleng
Club, and ending with manifestly unreasonable judgments rendered by the courts of Laos,
Respondent directed a result in favor of ST that deprived Sanum of its entitlement to 60%
of the revenues generated by its investment in the Thanaleng Slot Club. The entire process

was marred by manifest procedural defects, as well as producing a result that was

65

substantially unreasonable.”*° Sanum’s loss impacted the value of LHNV’s investment in

Sanum.

176. At the closing of the Hearing, the Claimants confirmed that their Thanaleng claim in this
proceeding is not based on denial of justice but on the allegation that the totality of the
Respondent’s treatment substantially deprived the Claimants of the enjoyment of their

investment without the payment of compensation.”

177. The Claimants insist that Sanum did have an ownership interest in Thanaleng as established
in the Master Agreement, and invested millions of dollars in Thanaleng. The Claimants
argue that the Respondent’s interpretation of the Master Agreement is contrary to the
understanding and conduct of the parties to this agreement; it was a binding agreement that
contemplated future negotiations between Sanum and a would-be supplier of slot machines
and not between Sanum and ST. The fact that the Master Agreement contemplated
additional agreements does not detract from its binding character. The Claimants point out
that when ST sought the judicial annulment of the Master Agreement, the document was
described as the “basic agreement defining rights in order to manage the relations between

both parties.”**

178. The Claimants dispute the relevance of the cases relied on by the Respondent because in
the instant case the Respondent consistently treated the Master Agreement as legally
binding, “[o]nly Laos — for the first time in these proceedings — has ever characterized the
Master Agreement as an agreement to agree that did not generate legally enforceable

rights.”°?

179. According to the Claimants, ST refused repeatedly to accept payment in exchange for a

contractually-required exchange of rights which did not extinguish the rights of Sanum,

“but merely constituted another breach by ST of its obligations to relinquish control of the

club to Sanum.”!°

180. The Respondent submits that the decision of the Lao Courts concerns a private dispute
between ST and Sanum and there was nothing untoward in the various judicial proceedings
in Laos. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has committed abuse of process by
pursuing contradictory claims in parallel arbitrations against Laos based on the same
treaties and the same economic interests. In this respect, the Respondent, at the Hearing,

recounted the time line of the procedure:

We have in July 2012 the decision of the Lao Commercial Court.
Immediately, before they exhausted their local remedies, which they are
required to do under international law, they filed this arbitration alleging
that the Thanaleng court decision was a denial of justice and an
expropriation. Later they amended to say it’s an expropriation.

In June 2015, there was a decision by the LHNV tribunal on the first
material, the breach application. They didn’t prevail.

Three months later, they filed the SIAC arbitration against ST on the same
contracts, alleging that the Lao court proceedings had no meaning, they
were just -- how would one say it?

One would say their view of the Lao court proceedings in Singapore was
that they were a voluntary mediation. If you don’t like the result of a
mediation, you withdraw and you go to court. That’s how they’re treating
the Lao court proceeding when they go to Singapore: it didn’t matter, is it
wasn’t definitive.

So, they get an ST SIAC Award in August 2016. They filed it in the Lao
courts in 2017.

Then the Lao courts refused to enforce it in August 2017. On 1 September
2017, they filed a denial of justice claim in the new ICSID arbitration.
Then in December 2017, the second material breach application was
granted, reinstating this tribunal to hear the Thanaleng case again.

So they have these conflicting — once you issued the second material
breach decision, it revived these two treaty claims that are in conflict with
the treaty claims they had filed in September 2017.'""

67

181. The Respondent further explained:

Sanum said in these cases that the 26 July 2012 decision of the court was
expropriation number one. They said their rights were expropriated, that’s
the claim here, and they filed the first BIT claims in August 2012.

But the second BIT arbitration says that the date of expropriation was
August 2017 when the Lao courts refused to enforce the SIAC award, and
that’s the subject of the second BIT arbitration.

So you have these inconsistent claims made by the same claimant under
the same _ treaties, based on the same facts. We say that’s an abuse of
process!

7.1.3. Tribunal’s Ruling

182. The Thanaleng claim relates to a dispute between the Claimants and ST. It concerns the
Respondent only to the extent of the Respondent’s alleged interference in court
proceedings, and only if its actions could be characterized as a violation of international

law.

183. The Claimants have placed the weight of their argument on the alleged interference of the
Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court proceedings in 2012. But the dispute resolution
provision in the Master Agreement (Article 2.10)!°? provides for a four-stage mechanism.
At the fourth stage, after a party to the Master Agreement has exhausted the remedies
available in the Lao Courts, it may submit the dispute to arbitration if it is unsatisfied with
the result without the need to demonstrate a breach of due process or other violations in the

conduct of the court proceedings.

102 Thid., p. 145, 5-19.

103 “If any dispute shall arise, the Parties agree to conduct an amicable negotiation. If such dispute cannot be settled
by mediation, the Parties may submit such disputes to the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization or Courts of
the Lao PDR according to the provision and law of Lao PDR in accordance with this Agreement. All proceedings of
the arbitration shall be conducted in Lao and English languages.

Before settlement by the arbitrator under the Rules of the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization, the Parties
shall use all effort ist the dispute resolution in accordance with the laws of Lao PDR.

If one of the Parti wu sfied with the results of the above procedure, the Parties shall mediate and, if necessary,
arbitrate such dispute using internationally recognized mediation/arbitration company in Macao, SAR PRC.” Master
Agreement, C(B)-001.

The Claimants also explained that the four-step mechanism provided for in the Master
Agreement has been found to violate Lao law and, therefore, “any award rendered under
the mechanism that differed from the judgment of the Lao Courts would [not] be
enforceable in Laos (the only country where the ST’s assets are now located) as a matter
of Lao ‘public policy.””!™

Sanum has exercised in full the four levels of remedies provided for in the Master
Agreement. After exhausting its recourse to the Lao Courts, Sanum initiated the SIAC
arbitration in 2015. In 2016, the SIAC tribunal awarded Sanum the $200 million it had

claimed.

The Claimants say that they have not been able to enforce the SIAC award and link the
inability to enforce it to the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial

Court in 2012. As explained by the Claimants at the Hearing:

The problem is, looking at the totality of the circumstances, the Lao Court
of Appeals — and that’s the highest level in an enforcement proceeding —
won’t allow enforcement of the SIAC award and so the original action that
the government took in ramming the original decision through to benefit
ST and forcing claimants to have to go to that additional stage, to have to
go to the fourth stage, that allowed ST the time to move all of its assets
back into Laos and put the claimants in a position where they would be
dependent on going to Laos to enforce the award against ST where the
same thing, or worse, could happen. So, there was a distinct consequence
at the stage of the measure relating to the Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.

Even if the claimant could then go on to the SIAC proceeding, which it

did, there was still a consequence and there was still harm caused by that

action, because being able to go to the fourth tier, that didn’t right the ship.

That didn’t enable Sanum to have a clear path to recovery. So there’s still

consequences to what the government did in 2012.”!°°
The Claimants want to skip over the fact that Sanum has a valid arbitral award against a
private party in which it was awarded 200 million dollars after it exhausted the remedies
in the Lao Courts for the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial

Court back in 2012. The alleged inability to enforce the award is not before this Tribunal

and it has not been proven by the Claimants that “there was a distinct consequence [of the
Government’s alleged interference] at the stage of the measure relating to the Thanaleng
proceeding in 2012.”!°6 There is simply no persuasive evidence that the alleged
interference of the Respondent in the proceeding of a lower court interfered with the steps
taken by the Claimants to exercise their rights under the Master Agreement and, in

particular, their recourse to SIAC arbitration.

The Claimants say their claim in the SIAC arbitration was not for the full amount of the
value lost in Thanaleng. The Claimants explained why Sanum capped its claim for
damages:

in part because ST did not appear and that raised the issue of whether or

not they were going to hide assets, such that it was fruitless to seek the full

value of Thanaleng. The full value of Thanaleng, I know we’re bifurcated

so we’re not going to talk very much about those kind of things, but the

full value of Thanaleng is more than 400 million in order to not have the

fees, and in light of the practical recognition that ST was likely hiding its

assets, we capped the SIAC claim at 200 million. So it won’t be possible

to recover the full amount from ST to cover the cost of the damage that the
government caused by directing the Thanaleng case in Laos.'””

The Respondent is not responsible for the decision of the Claimants to self-limit the amount
of the claim against ST. The evidence does not establish any improper interference by the

Respondent in the court proceedings.

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that the claim for expropriation in respect of the Thanaleng

investment lacks any merit.

7.2. Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino

Although the Claimants have in this instance put their focus on Sanum’s contractual rights,
LHNV is also involved as Sanum’s parent, and is equally subject to the Respondent’s
defence of lack of good faith and lack of clean hands in both the ICSID and PCA

proceedings, sufficient to disqualify the Claimants or either of them from any Treaty

remedy. Further, the Tribunal accepts the invitation of counsel for the Claimants to
consider “the totality” of the facts as relevant to the Treaty breaches for which LHNV seeks
relief, and in particular the presence or absence of good faith in respect of LHNV’s direct

and indirect investments in Laos.

7.2.1. Background

192. On 10 August 2007, a Project Development Agreement was concluded between Lao PDR,
and Sanum, the Laotian company Nouansavanh Construction Co. Ltd., and Mr. Sittixay
Xaysana for the development of the Paksong casino (“Paksong PDA”). Under the
Paksong PDA, a Laotian entity, Paksong Vegas and Casino Co. Ltd., was set up with Lao
PDR holding 20%, Sanum 60% and the ST entities 20%. The Paksong PDA required the
Company to build and operate a $25 million hotel casino and golf resort in the Paksong

district of Champasak Province.

7.2.2. Location of Paksong
193. As explained by the Claimants, the location was challenging:

“The challenges were both logistical and commercial. Logistically,
Paksong’s location meant that transportation of construction materials
would be more costly than at the Savan Vegas site, as access to the site
was more difficult and time consuming, and that other construction costs
would be significantly higher than those of Savan Vegas. Also, the
concession was located on the side of a large hill which precluded the
building of simple, large buildings to house the hotel and casino and other
amenities. Commercially, since Paksong was not located on the border
with Thailand or even in a population center in Laos that was easy to
access, it lacked a readily identifiable customer base. The challenges of
attracting customers made it difficult to identify the optimal type of facility
to construct on the site.”!°8

totality” of the facts, see supra paras. 3 and 191.

(Respondent's Opening Submission Slide, 96)
194. Mr. Baldwin testified about the problem posed by Paksong’s distance from the Thai border:

Another challenge posed by Paksong Vegas had to do with its customer
base. Because Lao citizens generally are restricted from playing table
games, the customer base for our casinos consists largely of Thai citizens
who live in Northeastern Thailand. However, because Paksong Vegas
would be located deep in Laos’s interior, without easy access to the border,

we were concerned that it would be difficult to attract customers to the
109

casino.
195. These challenges notwithstanding, Mr. John Baldwin testified that the Paksong project
package “came with very valuable benefits. Chief among these were the monopoly gaming

rights in Champasak and Salavan Provinces granted to Paksong Vegas under the PDA.”!!°

196. Due to the challenges posed by the site, on 31 March 2008, Paksong Vegas proposed to the
provincial government, inter alia, to move the entire project to the area near Chong Mek.

On 29 April 2008, the proposal was rejected by the provincial government.

197. On 21 August 2008, the office of the Prime Minister advised that Paksong Vegas was to
return Paksong and pursue only the project at Khone Phapheng (where the Government

also favoured development) together with other interested parties. The notice from the

Champasak Provincial Office requested Sanum “to follow the agreements already reached
by higher authority and only do the work at Kilometer 30 in Paksong. (According to
instructions from the Government Secretariat, if the company cannot comply, then the
project must be placed on hold for now).”!!! The notice added that “[i]t is not approved to
open casino branches in Paksong and other places, only at Khone Phapheng. The Paksong

land (Kilometer 30) will be returned to the Government.”!!?

On 23 October 2008, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a notice, purporting to strip
Paksong Vegas of its monopoly rights. The Prime Minister’s Office also reiterated that
Yingsoksay, the operator of the existing hotel and resort in the area, could look for other
foreign investors to develop Khone Phapheng; Paksong Vegas could participate in that
development if it chose to do so, but either way, according to the Prime Minister’s Office,
it no longer had the exclusive right to do so. Further, on 19 December 2008, Champasak
provincial authorities instructed Paksong Vegas to return the land concession it had been
granted so it could be used for “another purpose,” referencing the Prime Minister’s 21

August 2008 notice.!!?

On 30 January 2009, a meeting was held in the MPI’s offices. It was attended by all Lao
agencies concerned and Paksong Vegas. The Paksong Vegas and Casino Development
Project and the Khone Phapheng Entertainment Complex Project Development were

discussed. The Tribunal will re-visit this meeting in its analysis.

On 27 April 2010, the MPI terminated the PDA because Paksong Vegas had not signed a
land concession agreement in accordance with Article 4 of the PDA, and construction on

the project had been delayed for more than two years, which affected the “social-economic

development plan of Champasak province.”!'4 Termination of the PDA was re-affirmed

by the Respondent on 10 April 2012.

The Respondent claims that Sanum was not a ready, willing and able investor for the
Paksong project. The Claimants argue that the Respondent ignores the evidence that Lao
authorities had ordered Sanum to cease construction and two years later without prior
notice cancelled the PDA on grounds of failing to develop the land. According to the
Respondent, Sanum did not dispute the concession because the location was not
commercially acceptable. The Respondent explains that Paksong and Savannakhet were
linked; they were part of a bargain: whoever would develop Savannakhet, an excellent
commercial site, must also develop the less attractive Paksong. The provincial government
was keen to develop the remote areas while Sanum was interested only in more profitable
sites; the interests of Sanum as a commercial developer and of the provincial government

were not aligned.

Mr. Baldwin wanted to develop a site at Chong Mek. He agreed that the monopoly rights
were limited to the Paksong development area and did not include Chong Mek, “unless the
government agreed to modify this. The way it’s written right now, it does not include
Chong Mek but it doesn’t say we can’t ask for modifications.”!!5 Mr. Baldwin appeared

to be following a strategy of bait and switch.

The terms of the notice rejecting the proposal affirm that at the time the Government’s
intention was not to terminate the PDA, but to request that the existing agreements be

respected.

The Claimant admitted, at the meeting of 30 January 2009, that “it has not carried out the

Paksong Vegas project as scheduled in the contract and as it was presented to the Province.”

Mr. Baldwin confirmed at the Hearing that no contract to build a $25 million five-

star hotel with a casino and nightclub was ever signed.''°

Paksong Vegas had not made the investment it had promised in the PDA within the
required timeframe as admitted by Mr. Baldwin and, in the Tribunal’s view, never intended

to.

7.2.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

On Mr. Baldwin’s own admission, the Claimants never believed that the Paksong site could
be developed on commercially attractive terms. The Claimants’ argument that work was
being done and, if not done, was due to the Government order to stop the work is not
credible. Accordingly, while the issue of the expropriation of the Paksong Vegas
investment is not before this Tribunal as such, and this Tribunal does not purport to decide
any issue which is not before it, nevertheless the underlying facts of the Paksong Vegas
venture reinforce the Respondent’s general defence that Mr. Baldwin’s relationship with
Laos was throughout characterized by bad faith. To the extent necessary to determine the
bad faith issues, and for that purpose alone, the Tribunal finds on a careful review of the
facts that not only has LHNV failed to demonstrate any lack of good faith on the part of
the Respondent in respect of Paksong Vegas but, on the contrary, concludes that Mr.
Baldwin negotiated throughout his dealings with the Respondent in bad faith and that such
bad faith is to be attributed to LHNV on the basis that as the directing mind of LHNV, the

parent of Sanum, Mr. Baldwin’s conduct was and is its conduct.

7.3. Paksan Slot Club

Although the Claimants’ primary focus is on Sanum in respect of Paksan, LHNV is also
implicated as Sanum’s parent, and the Paksan episode is relevant to the Respondent’s
allegation that the entirety of the Claimants’ investments in Laos was tainted from first to

last by bad faith.

7.3.1. Background

As told by Sanum and not disputed by the Respondent, the relevant facts are that “[s]oon
after Sanum agreed to partner with ST, it discovered that there was an existing slot club in
operation in the Paksan district of Bolikhamxay Province - one of the provinces in which
Savan Vegas has the exclusive right to operate. To enforce that exclusive right, ST asked
the Government of Bolikhamxay Province to shut down the club, and it did so.”!!” The
existence of the slot club led Savan Vegas to open its own club at the same location, the

Paksan Hotel.

The Ministry of Information and Culture (“MIC”) granted Savan Vegas a one-year
license to operate a slot club in the Bolikhamxay Province on 24 October 2007. The MIC

renewed the license on 26 November 2008.

After the lease of the former club expired in October 2008, Savan Vegas signed its own
lease on 25 December 2008 and refurbished the space in the Paksan Hotel formerly
occupied by the slot club. The club re-opened on 25 October 2009 and the MIC renewed

the slot license for another year on 27 October 2009.

On 18 February 2010, the Prime Minister’s Office ordered the slot club license to be
cancelled: “The authorization to open an electronic gaming club granted to Savan Vegas
Ltd. by the Information and Culture Department of Bolikhamxay Province is not in
accordance with regulations in that it exceeds the authority of that office. Therefore, you
should stop operation of electronic gaming at Paksan Hotel. Further, the company is no

longer authorized to erect an advertising billboard in Bolikhamxay Province.”!'®

The license was not renewed in 2010. On 11 March 2011, the Government ordered the
MIC and the provincial Governor to close the club within three days. The club closed on

13 March 2011. Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime Minister to re-open the club.

76

The petition was denied on 19 May 2011 and Savan Vegas was ordered to comply with

Notice No. 305.

7.3.2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal concludes that the license granted in 2009 had expired in October 2010 and
had not been renewed. Monopoly rights kept competitors out but did not entitle Savan
Vegas to establish and operate other gambling facilities unless those other facilities were
specifically authorized. The Claimants have not shown that Savan Vegas had a right to the

license’s renewal or even that it attempted to renew the license.

At the time the Paksan slot club closed, the club was operating without a license and there
is no documentary evidence that the Respondent had created any legitimate expectation in
the Claimants that the license would be renewed or that it may operate de facto as if it had
a license. The Claimants’ argument about a de facto license begs the question of why
Sanum had applied for the license’s renewal in the preceding years. The Tribunal concludes
that the license expired on its own terms and had terminated when the slot club was ordered
to be closed. The Tribunal accordingly concludes, as with the Paksong Vegas
expropriation claim, that while the Paksan slot club expropriation claim is not before this
Tribunal as such, the underlying facts bear directly on the allegations of bad faith on the
part of the Respondent asserted before this Tribunal by the Claimant, LHNV. The Tribunal
finds on a careful review of the facts that LHNV has failed to demonstrate any lack of good
faith on the part of the Respondent in respect to Paksan, but on the contrary that Mr.
Baldwin’s bad faith activity is to be attributed to LHNV, Sanum’s parent, on the basis that
Mr. Baldwin is the directing mind of LHNV and his conduct is attributable to LHNV.

7.4, Thakhet Casino and Hotel Resort

In this situation, as well, the Claimants and the Government accuse each other of bad faith.
Mr. Baldwin, the directing mind of both Claimants, testified at length about the bad faith
treatment he received from the Government in respect of Thakhet. The Government, on

the other hand, presents Thakhet as further proof that Mr. Baldwin and LHNV were bad

faith investors who are not entitled to treaty protection. These cross allegations are relevant

to LHNV’s Treaty claims.

In 2010, Sanum started negotiations with the Committee for the Laos-Thailand Friendship
Bridge III Economic Zone Development (the “SEZ” and the “SEZ Committee”) for a land
concession at the foot of a planned bridge to cross the Mekong River. The negotiations
resulted in a MOU between Sanum and the SEZ Committee dated 20 October 2010. The
MOU contemplated a land concession to Sanum of about 90 hectares in the SEZ, payment
by Sanum of US $900,000 to allow the provincial government to compensate individuals
occupying the land, and US $400,000 to be paid upon signature of the MOU. The MOU
required Sanum to sign a land concession within 30 days and secure all necessary approvals
from the central and local governments within one year prior to building on the concession

land.

On 4 February 2011, Savan Vegas submitted a proposal for a slot club to the Governor of
the Khammouane Province and the MIC. The proposal was supported by the Governor
and, on 21 February 2011, the MIC approved the Savan Vegas’s Welcome Center and Slot
Club. Shortly thereafter, on 2 March 2011, the Prime Minister’s Office directed the MIC
to revoke its approval because slot club licenses may only be issued “by the Government”
which was interpreted by the Prime Minister to mean the Prime Minister’s Office.!!? On
29 March 2011, Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime Minister’s Office to grant
permission to open the Welcome Center and Slot Club in the SEZ. The petition was

rejected in October 2011.

It was decided in the Tribunal’s ruling on the Merits of the Claimant’s Second Material

Breach Application that, in the Tribunal’s view,

the Claimants have not established a land entitlement that includes the
disputed 16 hectares, and there is no undertaking by the Government in
Section 22 to use its powers of eminent domain to expropriate the existing
private owners for the financial benefit of the Claimant. Refusal to

78

expropriate private land for the private gain of the Claimant does not
constitute evidence of ‘bad faith.’!”°

This decision was reached by the Tribunal in the context of whether the Government
breached Article 22 of the Deed of Settlement by failing to negotiate the Thakhet related
agreements in good faith. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants have also failed to
establish rights to the remainder of the land referred to in the MOU. Sanum had 365 days
from the date of the Land Concession Agreement to seek all the approvals for all
investment activities described in the MOU. In turn, before the Land Concession
Agreement could be signed, Sanum needed to complete a Feasibility Study, a Master Plan
and a Socio-Economic and Environmental Impact Study for the Land Concession, all to be
approved by the Concessioner. The Land Concession Agreement required by the MOU
was never signed; it never went beyond the negotiation stage. Despite face to face
negotiations over the PDA throughout the summer and fall of 2011, Sanum and the SEZ
Committee had not finalized the terms of the PDA, including the land concession.!?! In
the overall picture, whether or not Sanum had obtained a licence had no impact on the

viability of its Thakhaek project.

In the view of the Tribunal it is clear from the MOU that Savan Vegas could not expand to
Thakhaek in the Kammouane Province without the “final approval from all
governmental authorities (central and local).”'?? The MOU provides for the eventuality
that the approval is forthcoming and also in case it is not.!?? Furthermore, the MOU
subjects the exact location of the Concession Land to a future agreement: “Once the exact
location of the Concession Land has been agreed upon, the Concessionee will confirm its
acceptance of the Concession Land in writing to the Concessioner.”!7* There was never

any agreement in this respect.

74.1. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The MOU shows that Savan Vegas’ monopoly rights did not encompass a right to establish

slot clubs or casinos beyond the area covered by the Savan Vegas PDA:

If the Concessionee would like to expand the casino or slot business of

Savan Vegas, which is an investment project of Sanum Investments

Limited according to the Foreign Investment License no. 09507 [not

readable], dated 17 August 2007 to the Concession Land to be a branch

(Welcome Center) of Savan Vegas such expansion shall be proposed,

approved and agreed in writing from the Government first before

implementing such expansion. The Khammouane Province wilfully [sic]

support the expansion of Savan Vegas to the Land Concession according

to the appropriate procedures and regulations. '?°
As regards the slot license, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s witnesses from the
MIC and the Government Secretariat Office have claimed that the license was issued by
mistake.'° The Respondent has argued that the MIC had no authority to issue the license
because of Notice No. 1957 of the Prime Minister and says that the license was procured
by a bribe. Leaving aside the issue of the bribes allegedly paid by the Claimants, the
Tribunal observes that the license was effective for less than ten days and that the
revocation was justified on the lack of authority of the MIC to grant it. The Tribunal
appreciates that Notice No. 1957 refers to the Government and is not explicitly limited to
the Prime Minister’s office but by 2011 Sanum was fully aware that the Prime Minister’s
Office was the essential authority on the Claimants’ gambling ventures in Laos. The Prime
Minister’s Office never approved the Claimants’ gambling project in Thakhaek. The
Claimants had just finished a bruising encounter with the Government over the Claimants’
failure to fulfill its obligations in respect of the Paksong Hotel and Casino project. By
2011, the Claimants had entirely failed to live up to their Paksong commitments, while
pretending otherwise. The Claimants had demonstrated themselves not to be good faith

investors.

RY,

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 141 of 457
80

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants were seeking in bad faith (even if not by bribes) to
manipulate Government officials to obtain approvals to which the Claimants were not
entitled. It is significant that the MIC licence was issued to Sanum in February 2011 by
the same Minister who was ordered to cancel the Paksan license for lack of authority one

year earlier in February 2010.

Negotiations for the renewal of the Flat Tax Agreement had stalled by March 2011. The
Government was agitating for accountability in respect of its 20% interest in Savan Vegas.
The Claimants allege that the 16-hectare parcel on Highway 13 was essential to the success
of their Thakhaek project, yet negotiations for the 16-hectare parcel never reached

agreement in the Tribunal’s view.

The Tribunal concludes that there is insufficient evidence of bad faith on either side in
respect of Thakhek. It was simply a commercial possibility that never reached the stage of

agreement.

VIOLATION OF OTHER TREATY RIGHTS

The Treaty claims are brought by the Claimant LHNV under the Netherlands-Lao BIT.
Nevertheless, the allegations of bad faith and treaty violations extend to the Government’s
treatment of all of the Claimants’ investments, as well as the Government’s defence of its
treatment of all of the LHNV and Sanum investments. Again, the Tribunal recalls the
submission by counsel for the Claimants that “the totality of the facts remains relevant to
certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants will seek relief.”!?’ However, in this part

8, where reference is made to the “Claimant” (singular), it refers to LHNV only.

8.1. The Claimant’s Allegations of Unfair and Inequitable Treatment

LHNV contends that it was denied fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 3(1) of

the Treaty in respect of Thanaleng.

etter dated 26 March 2018 from Claimant to the Tribunal.

229.

230.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 142 of 457
81

With respect to the fair and equitable treatment claims, the Claimant contends that even if
the applicable standard is no higher than the minimum standard of treatment under
customary international law as contended by the Respondent, the Claimant should succeed
because there has been “a gross denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness,

a complete lack of due process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons.” !7

The Claimant alleges that Respondent also violated Article 3(4) of the Treaty (Umbrella

Clause Claims) by repudiating its contractual obligations as follows:

(a) the Respondent imposed construction and brokerage taxes and overtime fees in

violation of the FTA;!?? and

(b) the audit of Savan Vegas violated provisions in the Shareholders’ Agreement and
in the PDA that protected Savan Vegas from unreasonable document and

information requests.'*°

The Claimant further alleges that Respondent inflicted discriminatory and less favourable
treatment on Sanum and its investments (in relation to Articles 3(1), 3(2) and 4 of the

Treaty) with the following measures:

(a) by imposing a 30% tax rate on the Ferry Terminal Slot Club, which was over 100

times more than the 0.22% rate charged to ST;33!
(b) by assisting ST in ejecting Sanum from its Thanaleng joint venture investment; '**

(c) by pursuing an unlawful audit by E&Y which favoured ST over Sanum by

facilitating ST’s attack on Sanum’s management of Savan Vegas.!**

231. In respect of the Thanaleng Slot Club (in relation to Article 3(1) and 6 of the Treaty):

(a) the Respondent deprived the Claimant of the benefit of its investment through
arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory court proceedings that lacked any semblance of
due process and by the participation of its law enforcement officials in physically

evicting Sanum personnel and machines from Thanaleng;!*+

(b) by the same conduct, the Respondent also violated both the fair and equitable
treatment and the unreasonable or discriminatory impairment standards contained

in Article 3(1) of the BIT.!*°

8.2. The Onus of Proof

232. The Claimant accepts both the legal onus and the evidentiary onus of establishing one or

more treaty breaches on a balance of probabilities.

8.3. The Claimant’s Lack of Good Faith

233. Much of the Claimants’ case rests on the allegation that it proceeded in all respects in good
faith but was thwarted at every turn by a corrupt and devious Government acting in bad
faith. On the contrary, in the Tribunal’s view the evidence is clear that the Claimants dealt
in bad faith with the Government from the initial signing of the Paksong Hotel and Casino
PDA calling for a US $25 million hotel and casino and thereafter included the financial
irregularities in the operation of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. The Claimants never
intended to build a US $25 million facility in Paksong. From the Claimants’ perspective,
the benefit of the Paksong PDA was a monopoly to block other more serious investors from
offering gambling facilities in Champaska and Salavan Provinces. Having obtained the
monopoly, the Claimants attempted to force the Government’s hand in relocating the
project to what, from the Government’s perspective, was a much less attractive site. The

bad faith continued through the disputes over the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, which

was built but operated in defiance of Sanum’s reporting obligations to the Government
(and, when the books were eventually opened, revealed significant financial irregularities).
The bad faith continued with Mr. Baldwin’s recent efforts to deter Madam Sengkeo’s
appearance to testify at the merits proceeding and the sham MaxGaming offer to purchase

Savan Vegas in April of 2015.

The principle of good faith arises in investment treaty arbitrations in various contexts.
Tribunals, of course, regularly refer to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention for the rule
that treaties shall be interpreted in good faith. The obligation extends to a duty of parties
to arbitrate in good faith.!*° In Phoenix v. Czech Republic, the tribunal referred to Phoenix’s
“jnitiation and pursuit of this arbitration” as “an abuse of the system of international ICSID
investment arbitration.”!*” (The tribunal found an abuse of rights in that case by the
“claimant’s creation of a legal fiction in order to gain access to an international arbitration

procedure to which it was not entitled.”!°*)

The Tribunal listened carefully to the testimony of Mr. John Baldwin and found him to be
an argumentative witness who preferred evasion to candour. Much of his testimony was
simply not credible. He proceeded in bad faith from the outset in assuring the Government
that he intended to invest US $25 million at the Paksong site, which by his own account

would have been highly unprofitable.

Mr. Baldwin is the directing mind of both Claimant companies. His conduct throughout
was to advance their corporate interests. His bad faith conduct is their conduct. While the
Government’s conduct was at times aggressive and inappropriate in relation to the
Settlement (as documented, for example, in the Second Material Breach Application),

nevertheless the Claimants failed to establish that the Government acted in bad faith in

136 Libananco Holdings Co Limited v. Republic of Turkey, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Final Award, Exhibit CLA-
168, where good faith was discussed in the context of the alleged interception and surveillance by Turkish police of
legally privileged communications between the claimant, its counsel and witnesses. See also Born, International
Commercial Arbitration at pp. 1008-1014 and Methanex Corporation v. United States of America, UNCITRAL
(1976), Final Award, Exhibit CLA-259.

relation to the investors or the investments during the time period covered by this revived

arbitration.

It is well established that the bad faith conduct of the investor is relevant to the grant of

relief under an investment treaty.'*?

To summarize, the particular acts of bad faith by Mr. Baldwin on behalf of the Claimants

of most concern to the Tribunal are:

(A) _ misrepresentations made to the Government to obtain Paksong Hotel and Casino
PDA on the strength of a promise to make a US $25 million investment on the site

which, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants never intended to pursue;

(b) likely making illegal payments to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of

the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino;

(c) likely attempting to obstruct justice with the payment of US $875,000 to Madam
Sengkeo directed, as to US $575,000 to the obstruction of the due process of this

arbitration by paying Madam Sengkeo not to testify;

(d) attempting to mislead the Treaty Tribunals with the sham offer to purchase the

Savan Vegas from MaxGaming Consulting.'*°

As will be seen, the Claimant’s allegations of the other treaty violations (in addition to

expropriation) also fail on the facts. However, having listened to Mr. Baldwin’s

139 See UNCTAD Series on International Agreements III, Fair and Equitable Treatment (2012) at pp. 83-85:
Investor conduct has emerged as a relevant factor in the analysis of FET claims by arbitral tribunals. It may
be relevant in two ways. First, it may justify the measure taken against the investor by the respondent
country. Thus in Genin v. Estonia, the tribunal found that the Estonian national bank had good reasons to
revoke the operating license of the claimant’s investment because the claimant had failed to disclose relevant
facts. In such cases, the adverse measure serves as a State’s reaction to, or a sanction for the investor’s
conduct...Fraud or misrepresentation on the part of an investor may form the basis of a legitimate
regulatory interference with its rights. In such cases, even the outright termination of the investment
may be justified, provided it is a proportionate response to the investor’s conduct in light of the
relevant domestic laws of the host State...in some situations, an investor’s own conduct may be held to be
a cause for the harm suffered.

140 Although the MaxGaming incident occurred after the date of Settlement, it was fully debated at the Hearing and

formed part of the corpus of the bad faith allegations.

explanations over several hearings of his dealings with Laos, the Tribunal wishes to leave
in no doubt its conclusion that Mr. Baldwin and LHNV exhibited manifest bad faith in
various efforts not only to manipulate the Government to advance their gambling initiatives

but, in the instance of Madam Sengkeo, to manipulate the arbitration process itself.

8.4. Alleged Wrongful Treatment of the Thanaleng Investment

At issue are the proceedings before the Courts of Laos between Sanum and ST. The
Claimants allege that they were denied due process to a level that constituted a denial of

justice.

8.4.1. The Claimant’s Argument
In respect of the Thanaleng Slot Club, the Claimants contend that:

(a) the Government deprived the Claimant LHNV of the benefit of its investment in
Sanum through arbitrary, unfair and discriminatory court proceedings that lacked
any semblance of due process and by the participation of its law enforcement

officials in physically evicting Sanum personnel and machines from Thanaleng;!*!

(b) by the same conduct, the Respondent also violated both the fair and equitable
treatment and the unreasonable or discriminatory impairment standards contained

in Article 3(1) of the BIT.!*7

While the origin of the court case was a “private dispute”, the Claimants contend that their
Thanaleng claims manifestly implicate the conduct of Lao judicial and executive branch
officials including the Minister of Justice and the police on the spot at the time of the
seizure. According to Claimants, the result was wrongful internationally because it was

arbitrary, unfair, discriminatory and lacked any semblance of due process. Moreover, the

86

Thangaleng proceedings deprived LHNV of the shareholder value of Sanum’s Thanaleng

investments without compensation.

The Claimants relied upon the expert opinion of Maitre Gérard Ngo'** who found due
process violations in the Court summons to Sanum, which was made only 48 hours before
the trial scheduled for 26 July 2012, the limited duration of the hearing of 26 July 2012 (90
minutes), the brevity of the judges’ deliberation and the conclusion set out in the judgment

which (the Claimant) argues had been decided before the hearing began.

The Claimants allege that the Courts of Laos were controlled and interfered with by the
Government against Sanum and constituted a denial of justice. The evidence for this

allegation comes from Mr. Baldwin'* and Mr. Richard Pipes.'4°

The Claimants further contend that the Minister of Justice wrongfully intervened in the
physical eviction of Sanum from the Thanaleng premises on 29 April 2012, thereby
favouring ST, contrary to the laws governing the execution of judgments in Laos and

principles of international law.

Maitre Gérard Ngo Expert Report, para. 176.

‘4 Mr. Baldwin testified in his Third Witness Statement as follows:

118. I was eventually able to meet with Minister [Justice] Chaleun on 27 April 2012. He said that the pressure
to rule against us was coming from “high up”. I inquired who was pressuring him, noting that you could not
get much higher than the Minister of Justice. I asked if it was the Prime Minister; he said no. I asked if it
was the President; he said no. Then I asked if it was the Vice President, Bounnhang Vorachit, and he

shrugged his shoulders. I took this to be an acknowledgement that it was the Vice President of Laos who
was pressuring Minister Chaleun. I was surprised and disappointed by this sudden change in Chaleun...

29. I should note that in several meetings I had with the Chief Judge handling the case, the Chief Judge told
me that he too was under a great deal of pressure to resolve the case quickly, with a predetermined result that
would not be to our benefit. At times, the Judge was almost apologetic and wanted me to understand that,
when cases are filed in which powerful people in Laos have an interest, the result is often mandated by high-
ranking Government officials. In fact, the Chief Judge and other Lao attorneys confirmed to me that these
types of cases are referred to as “directed ones”. At one point, the Chief Judge told me in his chambers that
in our case he was “just the driver” and that he was being told where to go.

8.4.2. The Respondent’s Argument

246. The Government contends that Sanum had no cognizable interest in the Thanaleng Slot
Club because the operative contract (the Temporary Thanaleng Participation Agreement
dated 23 February 2010) expired on its own terms on 11 October 2011 and as the Courts
of Laos correctly held, the Master Agreement dated 20 May 2007 did not create enforceable

rights. The Master Agreement itself so states:

The Parties hereby agree to negotiate and work towards entering into
certain joint ventures, represented by necessary agreements, which shall
convey 60% of all 2! Party’s gaming business located in the country of
Lao PDR (the “Joint Ventures”). This Agreement is not intended to be a
definitive agreement but only provides the Parties’ general understandings
of their relationship. The Parties agree to work together in good faith to
negotiate and finalize all necessary agreements to fully implement the
concepts and terms set forth in this Agreement.'“° (emphasis added)

247. The trial Court held against Sanum by its decision dated 26 July 2012,'*’ affirmed by the

3148

Court of Appeal on 11 December 201 and affirmed again by the Supreme Court of Laos

on 4 April 2014, whose decision stated:

The Defendant [Sanum] claimed that once the contract with the electrical
slot machine supplier expired, the main contract issued on 30 May 2007,
and other contracts, should be effective immediately to cover the
obligations between Sanum Investment Company (Defendant) and the HT
Vegas Company Limited (Plaintiff). However, this is not the case, due to
the fact that it is stated in the beginning part of the main contract, wherein
it is defined, that this contract has no intent to be a strict contract, as it
is only to support the parties toward having an overall understanding of
their relationship.

This [evidence] shows that the parties cannot consider the main
contract as a completed business joint venture agreement due to this
contract determining only general principles on how to develop sub-
contracts and agreements between both parties in all gambling joint
ventures. Therefore, the parties need to renew the contract to be in

compliance with the main contract issued on 30 May 2007.'° (emphasis
added)

The Government contends that “the proper procedures were applied under the Lao court

rules. Those rules ... plainly meet international standards of procedural fairness.”!°°

The Respondent’s legal expert, Professor Hervé Ascensio, concluded:

83. On the basis of the rules of international law, and having considered
the legal and factual circumstances of the case, my conclusions are the
following ones:

1) as far municipal legality, the domestic proceedings complied with the
standard of international law;

2) no violation of international law is demonstrated concerning access to
an independent and impartial court;

3) no violation of international law is demonstrated concerning the
fundamental procedural guarantees;

4) the decisions adopted on the merits by Laotian courts on the Thanaleng
site do not reveal a substantive denial of justice.'*!

Respondent contends that the Claimants’ legal expert, Maitre Gérard Ngo, lacks relevant
expertise and that (again according the Respondent), his criticisms were effectively
rebutted by the Respondent’s expert, Professor Hervé Ascensio, who expressed the view
that:

Taking into account the whole of the legal and factual circumstances, it

does not appear manifest that the threshold of arbitrary, applicable under

public international law, was crossed.'**

The Government considers that there is no credible evidence that it interfered with the

Court proceedings.

Sanum was afforded due process in knowing the case it had to meet and every opportunity

to lead evidence and make submissions in its own defence.

8.4.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

The Tribunal’s role is to apply international law, not the domestic law of Laos. It has no
jurisdiction to sit on appeal from the Courts of Laos. As stated by the Arif v. Moldova

tribunal:

The Tribunal is not in a position and has no competence to take sides in
this controversy. If it tried, it would indeed sit as a court of appeal over
decisions of the Moldovan judiciary.!*?

The decision of three levels of Laotian courts on the interpretation of the Master Contract
went against Sanum, and in the Tribunal’s view, neither the interpretation given by those

Courts to the agreements nor the judicial process offended international standards. '**

The Tribunal heard the viva voce testimony of Judge Soulideth Souvannasaly, one of the
judges who heard the Sanum case at first instance. He disputed Mr. Pipes’ evidence about
Government interference'® and testified that, contrary to Mr. Pipes’ Witness Statement,
Sanum did not press its earlier request for an adjournment when its case came on for a

hearing.!°°

Q. You received a request for postponement from Sanum on 25 July 2012. My question is: in the courtroom,
on 26 July 2012, did you ask anyone representing Sanum if they wished to press their request for a
postponement?

A. So, I asked this

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 151 of 457

The Tribunal considers 48 hours to be an excessively short notice for a trial but Judge
Soulideth testified that when the trial was called, Sanum was present in Court and, having
failed to press its request for an adjournment, there was nothing to prevent the case from

proceeding and it did proceed with the participation of Sanum’s representatives.

Moreover, according to Judge Soulideth, Sanum was free to present evidence and make
such submissions as it saw fit. Judge Soulideth denied that the disposition of the case had
been decided prior to the hearing (contrary to the witness statement of Richard Pipes). The
narrative portion of the judgment had been drafted beforehand based on the documentation
(a customary practice in Laos, according to the Judge), but the “consideration” and

“decision” were not written until following the panel deliberations after the hearing.!*”

The Tribunal would have been interested in hearing from the Sanum representatives who
were present at the trial but they were not called. In the circumstances, the Tribunal accepts
the evidence of Judge Soulideth and rejects the allegations of the Claimants that this was a
“directed case” whose outcome was “mandated by high ranking Government officials” as
unproven. On the evidence, there was no breach of fair and equitable treatment or other
Treaty violation, and no wrongful treatment by the judiciary of the Claimant’s Thanaleng

investment by denial of justice or otherwise.

. Did The Respondent’s Treatment of Savan Vegas Breach Articles 3(1) and 3(4) of

the Treaty?

As mentioned, the Government, which was a shareholder in the Savan Vegas project,

initiated an audit by E&Y.

 

Sanum personally in the courtroom that, “Do you wish to proceed or do you wish to still

have that postponement that you submitted on 25 July 20122”, but they did not ~ they did not say they did.

'57 Judge Soulideth testified:

It was not until our deliberation that we reached a decision and drafted the remaining part of the
“Consideration” and the “Decision” section of the Court Decision (from the last line of page 4 of the Court
Decision —“...this act as violation of the agreement according to Article 33 of the Contract Law.” These can
be found on pages 5 and 6 of the Court Decision.

8.5.1. The Claimant’s Argument

The Claimant says that the Government’s audit proceeded in bad faith and constituted one
of the wrongful acts orchestrated by the Government to assist ST!** in its ongoing dispute
with the Claimant. In the result, Article 3(4) of the Treaty was breached because of non-
compliance with the Government’s contractual obligations. Moreover, the Claimant

argues, Article 3(1) was also breached because:

(a) the Government’s abusive exercise of authority (as Government not shareholder)

was inconsistent with the good faith principle embedded in the FET standard;

(b) even if not adopted for an improper purpose, measures that are arbitrary and

discriminatory are also inconsistent with the FET;

(c) the audit was conducted in an unreasonable manner that impaired the LHNV’s

enjoyment of its investment;'°?

As a result of the audit and other wrongful conduct, the Government is said to have imposed
on Savan Vegas “unlawful and discriminatory tax demands in the amount of US $23.8
million.”!© Moreover, the Ferry Terminal Slot Club was taxed at a rate grossly in excess

of the tax rate imposed on ST and, was therefore discriminatory.'®!

8.5.2. The Respondent’s Argument

The Parties settled any and all claims with respect to pre-July 2014 taxes as part of the

192

mutual commitments contained in Article 7 of the Settlement'®” which provided that:

Laos shall forgive and waive any and all taxes and related interest and
penalties due and payable by the Claimants and the Gaming Assets up to
1 July 2014 in respect of the Gaming Assets, provided, however, that taxes
shall be due and payable as from 1 July 2014 as provided in Section 8

below. The taxes covered herein are all taxes and fees including but not
limited to those that are specifically indicated in Article 1 of the previously
signed FTA attached as Annex D hereto.

The Claimant accepted the tax waiver as part of the Settlement for which mutual releases
were exchanged, and the Claimant cannot now complain about tax measures which are not

properly part of this arbitration.

Equally, any tax issues arising after 1 July 2014 are outside the scope of this arbitration.

8.5.3. The Tribunal’s Ruling

With respect to the E&Y audit, the Respondent had good cause for concern about the
accounts of Savan Vegas. Sanum had not complied with its reporting obligations. The
Claimant LHNV has failed to establish bad faith on the part of the Respondent in pushing

for an audit in furtherance of its rights as a significant shareholder in Savan Vegas.

Nor was the Government conduct arbitrary. It had not received information it was owed
by reason of its shareholding interest in Savan Vegas. The request for an audit was not
abusive, and in the end the Government’s suspicions were vindicated by the disclosure of

serious financial irregularities.

There is no credible evidence that the E&Y audit was conducted in an unreasonable
manner. Sanum’s CFO, Mr. Clay Crawford, testified that E&Y made excessive
information demands that interfered with the efficient operation of the business but the
Tribunal heard no expert evidence from an independent auditor that E&Y departed from

normal audit practice.

Moreover, as earlier stated, the Tribunal is of the view that on a balance of probabilities
Mr. Baldwin dealt in bad faith with the Government in arranging illicit payments to stop

the E&Y audit prior to its completion.

The Claimant has not established any breach of contractual (or Treaty) obligations in

respect of Savan Vegas by the Government.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 154 of 457
93

270. As to the tax issues at Savan Vegas and the Ferry Terminal, it has already been pointed out
that the tax waiver was effective up to and including 1 July 2014.'° The tax complaints
were not revived by the outcome of the Second Material Breach Application which did

not set aside the Settlement but implemented it.

8.6. Alleged Violations of Treaty Rights in Respect of the Paksan Slot Club, Lao Bao and
the Savannakhet Ferry Dock

271. The Claimant’s allegations of wrongful acts and Treaty breaches in respect of these
investments have already been reviewed at length in the earlier reasoning of this Award.
While the Claimants did not press their complaints in respect of Lao Bao and the
Savannakhet Slot Clubs at the Hearing, those complaints relate essentially to tax matters
which were resolved with the 2014 Settlement. To the extent the complaints in this respect

were not withdrawn, they are dismissed.

8.7. Allegation that the Respondent Violated Article 3(4) of the Treaty (Umbrella Clause
Claims)

272. The Claimants argue that the Government repudiated its contractual obligations as follows:

(a) the Respondent imposed construction and brokerage taxes and overtime fees in

violation of the FTA;'™ and

(b) the audit of Savan Vegas violated provisions in the Shareholders’ Agreement and

the PDA that protected Savan Vegas from unreasonable document and information

requests.'®

Acts, with commentaries (2001), Exhibit CLA(LH)-087:

(a) the injured State has validly waived the claim;
(b) the injured State is to be considered as having, by reason of its conduct, validly acquiesced in the
lapse of the claim.

273. Inthe Tribunal’s view, for the reasons already explained:
(a) the tax complaints were rendered moot by Article 7 of the Settlement;

(b) the Claimant has not established that construction and brokerage taxes and overtime

fees were wrongfully imposed;

(c) the Claimant has not established that the Government’s document and information

requests in respect of Savan Vegas were unreasonable.

8.8. Allegations of Discriminatory and Less Favourable Treatment With Respect to
Investments pursuant to Article 3(2) and Article 4 of the Treaty

274. The Claimant alleges discriminatory and less favourable treatment with respect to Sanum

and its investments:

(a) by imposing a 30% tax rate on the Ferry Terminal Slot Club, which was over 100

times more than the 0.22% rate charged to ST;!%

(b) by assisting ST in ejecting Sanum from its Thanaleng joint venture investment;!©”

(c) by pursuing an unlawful audit by E&Y which favoured ST over Sanum by

nourishing ST’s attack on Sanum’s management of Savan Vegas.

275. The Tribunal has already rejected complaints (b) and (c). With respect to complaint (a),
Article 7 of the Settlement in respect of tax issues foreclosed any liability of the Claimant
or the Government with respect to the imposition of such taxes prior to 1 July 2014,

including the claim of discrimination.

276. In any event, the Claimants are in no position to complain of discrimination in the tax
system when much of the efforts of the Claimants were directed at obtaining special

treatment under an FTA and its extension for a further five years. To the extent other

corporate entities in Laos also obtained special rates, the fact remains that the Claimant
paid less tax than the law would otherwise have required, and, more importantly, whatever
it owed was forgiven by the Settlement, so even if there had been breaches (which has not

been shown to be the case), there was no loss or damage that could justify compensation.

The Claimant LHNV has failed to establish any factual foundation for its complaints of

Treaty breaches in respect of Thanaleng and Savan Vegas as previously discussed.

Bad Faith

While the Tribunal finds the Respondent’s allegations of bribery lack sufficient “clear and
convincing evidence” to justify an affirmative finding of specific acts of corruption,
nevertheless the probable existence of illicit payments to Madam Sengkeo and through her

to Government officials falls to be considered under the general allegation of bad faith.

When the Tribunal steps back and views the Claimants’ entire course of conduct at issue
in these proceedings as particularized above, including the probability of corruption in the
Claimants’ orchestration of the termination of the E&Y audit (itself an act of bad faith),
the manipulation of Government authorities to obtain a gambling licence at Thakhaek and
the commitments made in the Paksong PDA without any intention of building the US $25
million hotel and casino which was its basic requirement, thereby eliminating the
opportunity for other more serious investors to apply for gaming facilities in the Claimants’
monopoly area, all support the conclusion that the Claimants were contemptuous of the
commitments that came with the advantages of their Laotian investments. Mr. Baldwin’s

testimony only served to confirm the Tribunal in that unfavourable view.

While the Tribunal has already rejected the Claimants’ allegations for the reasons detailed
above, the Claimants’ bad faith initiation of some investments and bad faith performance
of other investment agreements (as detailed above) and the attempt of Mr. Baldwin to
compromise the integrity of this arbitration through an inducement to Madam Sengkeo not
to testify provide added reasons to deny the Claimant LHNV the benefit of Treaty

protection.

9. DISPOSITION ON COSTS

281. The Respondent Government claims costs for the period from 26 April 2016 through 22
February 2019 in respect of lawyers’ fees and expenses in the amount of $1 ,467,483.72.!°
These fees are exclusive of and apart from the costs sought by the Government arising out
of Sanum Investments Limited v. The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic
Republic, PCA Case No. 2013-13, which was not consolidated with this case but for the
most part was heard jointly with it. (The Respondent Government claims a total of
US $2,780,736.03 in respect of both the ICSID and PCA proceedings). By way of
comparison, the Claimants indicated that if successful (and even if not wholly successful)
they would be seeking US $ 20,929,951.36 in total in respect of both the ICSID and PCA
proceedings. The Claimant’s claim, unlike the Respondent’s claim, does include the

expenses and charges of the respective Secretariats.
282. Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (AF) Rules provides:

(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and
by whom the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the
expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal
may, to that end, call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it with
the information it needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of
the proceeding between the parties.

(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article
shall form part of the award.

283. Article 58 grants the Tribunal broad discretionary power to allocate costs, based on the
circumstances of the case. “While there is some variation in tribunals’ practices, the
prevailing approach of international investment tribunals is to order costs to follow the

event.”!”? LHNV itself has accepted the application cost-shifting principle in this

arbitration—having already submitted its request for “costs and expenses of this

proceeding, including attorneys’ fees.”!7!

According to the Claimants, the quantum of their original claims if wholly successful,

might have reached US $ 1 billion.

The costs claim advanced by LHNV and Sanum include US $10,109,872.71 for legal work
prior to the Settlement of June 15, 2014.'”? The Respondent’s claim commences post-
settlement, specifically from 26 April 2016.'” Thereafter, until 23 February 2017, the
Respondent’s claim is made only for the ICSID proceedings, as during that time only the
ICSID Tribunal was active — i.e., after the Claimant LHNV filed its Second Material
Breach Application, but before the date the Claimant Sanum filed its Second Material
Breach Application before the PCA Tribunal. From and after 23 February 2017 the two
cases (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6 and PCA Case No. 2013-13) proceeded in parallel

although, as mentioned, not consolidated.

Thus, after 23 February 2017, work on all written submissions, evidentiary applications,
interim conferences and hearings as well as the Hearing were combined, then evenly
divided as between the ICSID proceedings and the PCA proceedings. In the result, the
Respondent seeks an order that the Claimant LHNV pay 50% of its legal costs, including

lawyers’ fees and expenses, incurred from 23 February 2017, through to the present.!”4

The Claimant points out that it was successful on a number of the interlocutory matters
including a defeat of the Government’s jurisdictional challenges and establishment in the
Second Material Breach Application that the Government had failed in two important
aspects to honour the Settlement, namely the establishment of a new FTA to assist in the
sale of Savan Vegas, and the Government’s failure to halt existing and potential criminal

proceedings.!”> These were important successes for the Claimants but in the end, they failed

of any of the myriad of claims of Treaty violations (as distinguished from two breaches of
the 2014 Settlement Agreement, as mentioned). In the circumstances, the Tribunal thinks
it appropriate, in its discretion, to award the Respondent its lawyer fees and expenses in

the sum of US $1,293,720.27.

9.1. Expenses
9.1.1. Travel Expenses

The Respondent’s travel expenses represent travel to Brussels and Singapore twice by
various witnesses and the Respondent’s lawyers and staff, for matters involving the
Tribunal. These travel expenses also include travel to Laos, Paris, and Hong Kong for

matters such as fact development, evidence gathering and document review.'”°

9.1.2. Miscellaneous Services and Expenses

The remainder of the Respondent’s expenses relate to services and expenses required to
pursue the arbitrations, some of which were incurred in-house and others by external
vendors. Such services include translation services; court reporter and transcript fees;
express delivery expenses; research; and trial preparation services in Singapore, such as

copying, binding presentations, and creating witness and evidentiary notebooks.

The Respondent’s total expenses (other than legal fees and expenses) requested in this
arbitration amount to US $173,763.45.'7 This sum, taken together with legal fees and

made in equal parts. The Claimant made advance payments for a total of US $1,274,969
and the Respondent made advances for a total of US $481,622.95. The Tribunal orders the
Claimant LHNV to bear all the arbitration costs of the ICSID proceeding. Accordingly,
the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent US$ 481,622.95 for the expended
portion of the Respondent’s advances to ICSID.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

1.

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’”) on the basis of the Agreement on
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Lao People’s
Democratic Republic (PDR) and the Kingdom of the Netherlands (the “BIT” or the
“Treaty”), which entered into force on 1 May 2005, and the Arbitration Rules
(Additional Facility) of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes,
which entered into force on 10 April 2006 (the “ICSID-AF Rules”). The dispute
relates to actions by the Respondent the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
hereinafter referred to as the “Lao Government”, “Laos” or the “Respondent,” that
allegedly deprived Claimant of part or all of its investment in the gaming and tourism

industry in Lao PDR.

The Claimant, Lao Holdings N.V., is a company incorporated under the laws of Aruba,
The Netherlands Antilles, and is hereinafter referred to as “Lao Holdings” or the
“Claimant.” It is important to emphasize at the outset that the Claimant did not become
an investor in Laos until 17 January 2012 (“the critical date’’) at which time it took over
ownership of Sanum Investments Ltd., a Macao company, whose principals are John

Baldwin and Sean Scott, and which had been investing in Laos since 2007.

The present ruling concerns an objection by the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal ratione temporis to hear and determine the Claimant’s assertion that by reason
of the protection of the Treaty it is not subject to a New Tax Code enacted on 11

December 2011.

The Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the

“Parties.” Their respective representatives and addresses are listed on page (2).

II. ICSID PROCEDURAL HISTORY

5.

On 15 August 2012, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated 14 August 2012

from the Claimant against the Respondent, the Lao Government.

6. On 12 September 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in
accordance with Articles 4 and 5 of the ICSID-AF Rules and notified the Parties of the
registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to
proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible, in accordance with

Article 5(e) of the ICSID-AF Rules.

7. In accordance with Chapter III of the ICSID-AF Rules, the Parties agreed that the
Arbitral Tribunal would be composed of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each
Party and the third presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.
Professor Bernard Hanotiau, a national of Belgium, was appointed by the Claimant;
and Professor Brigitte Stern, a national of France, was appointed by the Respondent.!
On 22 March 2013, the Parties agreed to the appointment of The Honourable Ian
Binnie, a national of Canada, as President of the Tribunal, who accepted the
appointment on 23 March 2013. On 26 March 2013, the Secretary-General, in
accordance with Article 13(1) of the ICSID-AF Rules, notified the Parties that all three
arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed

to have been constituted on that date.

8. Mrs. Anneliese Fleckenstein, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as

Secretary of the Tribunal.

9. The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 8 May 2013, in London. The
Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was
agreed inter alia that the applicable ICSID-AF Arbitration Rules would be those in
effect from 10 April 2006, and that the procedural language would be English. The
Tribunal decided, on the application of the Parties, that the place of the proceedings

would be Singapore. The Parties agreed on a schedule for the proceedings, including

' On 27 February 2013, the Centre sought acceptance from Claimant and Respondent's appointees Professor
Bernard Hanotiau and Professor Brigitte Stern as arbitrators. Prof. Stern accepted her appointment on 27 February
2013. Prof. Hanotiau accepted his appointed on 4 March 2013.

production of documents, and the terms were embodied in Procedural Order No. 1

signed by the President of the Tribunal and circulated to the Parties on 18 June 2013.7

10. On 12 July 2013, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it would seek bifurcation
of the proceeding. On 2 August 2013, the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s

request.

11. A hearing on the Claimant’s amended request for provisional measures and the
Respondent’s request for bifurcation took place in London on 2 September 2013. In

A. The Factual Background to the Dispute

1S.

Sanum was incorporated in Macau in 2005 to invest in gambling operations in Asia. In
2007, as a result of investigations and inquiries by Mr. John Baldwin, Sanum entered
into agreements with ST Corporation, a Laotian company with numerous commercial
interests in that country, including potentially valuable government concessions for
hotel and casino projects. According to Mr. Baldwin, one of the attractions of ST as a
business partner was that it was reputed to be well connected to the Lao Government.

The attraction for ST was that Sanum had access to ample foreign funds to invest.

Sanum agreed to establish a joint venture with ST in a series of Laotian hotel and
gambling facilities. Sanum contends that its contribution was more than US$85

million.

Relations between Sanum and ST were governed by a Master Agreement dated 30 May
2007 which resulted in three major projects, The Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino
(“Savan Vegas”), The Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino (“Paksong Vegas’’) and a third
enterprise that invested in slot machine clubs in at least three locations in Lao, namely

Thanaleng, Lao Bao and the Ferry Terminal.

Sanum and ST each owned 40% of Savan Vegas and Paksong Vegas, with the Lao

Government owning the remaining 20%.

-ll-

A separate dispute involving Paksong Vegas is being determined by another arbitral

tribunal. It is not before this Tribunal.

The ownership structure of the slot clubs was more complicated and contested, but the

details are not germane to the present Jurisdictional Objection.

The Sanum investments did not acquire Dutch nationality for purposes of the Treaty
until 17 January 2012, when the Claimant was incorporated in Aruba, in The

Netherlands Antilles.

B. The Five Year Flat Tax Agreement

22.

23.

As part of the Lao Government’s investment incentive program, and in recognition of
its limited capacity to engage in tax audits of a complex cash based business, the Lao
Government granted Savan Vegas a five year Flat Tax Agreement (“FTA”) dated 1
September 2009, that required it to pay $745,000 per year in taxes each year through 31
December 2013. The Claimant says that it was promised that when the FTA expired
on 31 December 2013, it would be replaced by another flat tax agreement, ideally for
the remainder of the 50-year concession. The terms (and in particular the tax rate) were
to depend on negotiations arising out of the experience of the initial five year period.
As set out below in greater detail, Sanum initiated negotiations for a new flat tax
arrangement in March 2011 (which it said was necessary to attract further foreign long
term financing for investments). However, for reasons and in circumstances that are
contested in this proceeding, the Lao Government declined to enter into a renewal of

the FTA.

According to the Claimant, responsible Laotian government officials induced Savan
Vegas to believe (and the Savan Vegas management says it did believe so up until
March 2012 and beyond) that the FTA in some form would be renewed. The New Tax
Code was, it says, not a matter of “legal dispute” within the terms of Article 9 of the
Treaty until at least March 2012, when negotiations broke down more than two months
after the critical date [17 January 2012] of the acquisition of the investment by the

investor of Dutch nationality.

24.

25.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 174 of 457

-12-

The Lao Government says the failure of the Flat Tax negotiations was complete, and
must have been obvious to Savan Vegas to be a complete failure no later than
November 2011, when the Flat Tax negotiations had clearly been rejected (and the
rejection confirmed) by the Laotian Finance Minister. If Savan Vegas or its investors
thought the Lao Government breached any contractual right to a renewal, any such
contract dispute “crystallized” no later than December 2011 when Sanum received
notice of the Finance Minister’s decision. (The Claimant disavows any contractual

claim as relevant to the present jurisdictional objection.)

The Lao Government’s position is that the FTA extension negotiations and any “legal
dispute” over the application of the New Tax Code are inextricably linked. At
whatever point the negotiations for a new flat tax agreement failed (which is a major
point of disagreement), the New Tax Code would apply as a matter of law to Savan
Vegas. Any “legal dispute” in respect of the New Tax Code therefore crystallized
concurrently with the end of the Flat Tax negotiations which occurred, in the Lao
Government’s view, well before the critical date of 17 January 2012. The Claimant
therefore has no claim to Treaty protection in respect of the New Tax Code, and this

Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione temporis to hear such a dispute.

C. The New Tax Code

26.

27.

On 20 December 2011, the Laotian legislature enacted a casino tax of 80% of casino
revenues (not profits). The Claimant contends, and the Lao Government denies, that
Sanum was repeatedly assured by high Lao Government officials that this Act was
never intended to apply to Savan Vegas. The purpose of the casino tax, the Claimant
says it was assured by high ranking Laotian officials, was to discourage new entrants
into the Laotian gambling industry, not to penalize established businesses, such as

Savan Vegas.

The Lao Government, for its part, points out that the New Tax Code makes no
exception for Savan Vegas. The New Tax Code, as an exercise of its sovereign power,
applies to Savan Vegas according to its terms. Its potential application was known

(and disputed) by Sanum and its principals before the Treaty became applicable to the

Parties. That is why Sanum was anxious to obtain the FTA extension. The “legal

dispute” therefore predated the entry into force of the Treaty between the Parties.

The Claimant responds that as the Flat Tax negotiations were continuing up to and
including March 2012, neither Savan Vegas nor its investors, Sanum and the Claimant,
had any reason to believe that there was any prospect of the application of the
“confiscatory” casino tax of 80%, plus 10% WAT, to them. They had been assured
otherwise. There was therefore no legal dispute capable of giving rise to a Treaty
claim prior to the acquisition of Dutch nationality in Aruba on 17 January 2012 by the

investor.

D. Relations Deteriorate Between Sanum and ST (its Laotian Co-venturer)

29.

In the fall of 2011, relations between Sanum and ST deteriorated sharply. It is the
Claimant’s position in this arbitration that the Respondent, the Lao Government, took
active steps to advance ST’s interest at Sanum’s expense, including complicity in the
closure of the Thanaleng Slot Club and the sequestration of Sanum’s slot machines.
The position taken by the Claimant in its Notice of Arbitration dated 14 August 2012

was as follows:

42. Here ST has played the role of favored local, while members of
the Respondent’s justice, culture and revenue ministries, along
with its courts and even the Prime Minister’s Office, have shared
the role of abettor and expropriator. Indeed, Sanum’s story may
have been worse, given its discovery of how the President of ST,
Sithat Xaysoulivong and the Vice President of the Republic,
Bounnhang Vorachith, are in-laws. [Its] officials are actually
related as family to one and possibly more of the very
Government officials who have been orchestrating the steady
erosion of Sanum’s rights and assets within the Lao PDR.

In this context, the Claimant alleges an array of measures initiated by the Lao
Government beginning in April 2012, including what the Claimant regards as unfair
and oppressive audits of Savan Vegas, resulting in tax claims which the Claimant says
are invalid but, being unpaid, led to the freezing of Sanum’s bank accounts in Laos.
The series of Lao Government measures, the Claimant says, was calculated to deprive

Sanum of its investment in Laos. The application of the New Tax Code rate of 80% on

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 176 of 457

-14-

revenue is part and parcel of the Lao Government’s continuing policy of discrimination

and oppression, the Claimant says.

30. The Respondent, for its part, says that Sanum had for years been operating its gambling
operations using impenetrable accounting procedures, and in some respects, illegally,
making it impossible for the Lao Government to assess their real profitability (and thus,
perhaps, to settle on a realistic rate of “Flat Tax” for the future). As counsel for the
Lao Government put it at the 6 January 2014 hearing:

[The Claimants] decided, for their own reasons, that they would put all
their money into Thailand; well, they had been putting their money in
Thailand for the last five years. And it is illegal, it is against the law in
Laos for any Lao corporation to have a bank account outside the country,
and they had seven bank accounts outside the country for the last five
years. We can tell from some of the documents we received from Ernst
& Young that in one of those bank accounts in 2011, a year before the
“freezing order”, they put $11 million into a Thai bank account. That's
against the law. (Transcript, pages 19-20).

31. These extracts provide the flavour of the broader dispute, and the facts will have to be
decided in due course, but, for the purposes of the Lao Government’s objection to
jurisdiction, the only facts that have to be determined are those that relate to the
existence and timing of the legal dispute in relation to the application of the New Tax

Code to the Claimant’s investments.

E. Public Meetings and Discussion about Amendments to the Tax Code

32. The Lao Government insists, but the Claimant denies, that by the spring of 2011
Sanum must have been aware of proposed amendments to the Tax Code that would

increase the tax rate applicable to casinos not covered by an FTA.

33. In April 2011, the Tax Department sent invitations to the largest businesses in Laos to
attend a seminar/public meeting to discuss potential changes to the Tax Code.? The
seminar/public meeting actually took place on 11 May 2011 and was attended by
approximately 300 people. The handouts included a list of proposed new rates — the

excise rate for gaming revenues was proposed to be raised to 25%.

-15-

Ms. Manivone Insisiengmai, Director of the Laotian Tax Department, was the keynote

speaker. Time was made available for questions and public comment.

The Lao Government says that Sanum and Savan Vegas were invited to the meeting,

but cannot state for a fact whether they attended the meeting.*

On 20 June 2011, DFDL, a regional law firm with an office in Vientiane, held a
seminar to provide information to about 100 clients and potential clients about the
proposed New Tax Code, and about investment treaties more generally. The Claimant
says that Sanum was not a DFDL client at the time, had no notice of the meeting and

did not attend it.

In June 2011, at its semi-annual meeting, the Laotian National Assembly proposed to
amend the excise tax to increase the rate on gambling revenue to 60%. The
amendment was not adopted into law. However, the existence of this proposal was
publicly known. The next session of the Laotian National Assembly was to be held in

December 2011.°

The Claimant says any public discussion of changes to the tax code was not of interest

to Sanum or Savan Vegas, which expected to sign a new Flat Tax Agreement.

F. Negotiations for a Renewal of the Sanum FTA

39.

As stated earlier, the FTA between “the Tax Department” and Sanum covers the 5 year

period beginning, January 2009 and provides in Article 5 as follows:

The duration of this contract is for the period of 5 (five) years and valid
starting from 01 January 2009 up to 31 December 2013. The lump sum
payment of tax is considered as a trial for the first 5 year period, in case
of business growth and income has been increased on the basis of
certified existing data, the two Parties will discuss for further
improvement of the contract as to comply with the real income of the
business and the amount of tax payment will be reconsidered. (Emphasis
added)

* Exhibit RE-O1, 19.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 178 of 457

-16-

40. The Claimant says the FTA was not envisaged as a one-time arrangement, but as a 5-
year “trial” contemplating “further improvement [not termination] of the contract”

when “the amount of tax payment will be reconsidered.”

G. Government Notice 1121

41. On 10 June 2011, the Lao Government Secretariat in the Prime Minister’s office issued
what the Respondent calls a “decision,” No. 1121 (“Notice 1121”),° which refers to the
Sanum FTA and the “trial period” and then states the following:

. After the end of the trial period, the Parties shall comply with

principle as prescribed in the main and the laws.” (Emphasis
added)

42. The Lao Government says Notice 1121 manifested a decision that Savan Vegas’s FTA
would not be extended after the trial period of five years. It says that “most” of the
subsequent documents passing between the Parties and within the Lao Government
dealt with Sanum’s unsuccessful efforts to have this 10 June 2011 decision reversed.’
The Claimant says document 1121 is not, and does not pretend to be, a “decision.” The
operative part of document 1121 (at least in the English translation) is ambiguous. The
reference to “the principle as prescribed in the main agreement” could be taken as
referring to the renewal negotiations explicitly contemplated in Article 5 of the FTA.

Moreover, it seems to misstate the content of Sanum’s then current FTA.

43. When Sanum received a copy of document 1121 on 16 July 2011, the Claimant says it
did not understand it to be a “decision.” Discussions with the Lao Government

continued in respect of the proposed renewal of the FTA.

H. The Sequel to Notice 1121

44. On 20 June and 22 June 2011, the Ministry of Planning and Investment invited several

Ministries and Departments, including the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance,

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 179 of 457

to a meeting with Sanum. The meeting was called “in light of the Notice No. 1121 of

June 10, 2011.”

45. On 26 July 2011, Sanum itself asked for a meeting with the Tax Department of the
Ministry of Finance to discuss the FTA, “following the Notification from the

Government’s Secretariat No. 1121, dated 10 June 2011."8

46. On 4 August 2011, Ms. Manivone addressed a memo to the Minister of Finance
recommending that the Minister seek guidance from the Prime Minister’s office on
extending the Sanum FTA. Referring to Notice 1121, she stated the Tax Department’s
position that the FTA should be extended because the Tax Department lacked the
capacity to audit a gambling casino and because two other casinos in Laos had FTAs.”
Ms. Manivone’s 4 August 2011 memorandum to the Minister of Finance states in part

in the English translation as follows:

In response to the request from Savan Vegas and Casino Ltd., the Tax
Department is of the view that:

1. For Casino and slot machine businesses, the company shall pay
Lump Sum Tax as we lack experience in the management and
control of this kind of business. If the company is requested to
pay taxes according to its accounting holding, the collection of
the revenue might be less than lump sum. Like LaoYuan Ltd., as
mentioned above, casino business is a form of gambling business
that uses cash and does not provide receipts as evidence for
accounting controls and it is easy for tax evasion.

For other businesses (besides casino) the taxes shall be paid
according to the accounting holding...

2. With regard to the request from Savan Vegas for Lump Sum
Tax, we agree with the request but we are of the view that the
period for Lump Sum is too long and we cannot make
precise predictions for the future.

3. This request is made in a context of business extension with the
investment in hotel construction which has reached an advanced
stage and will continue to move ahead. For that reason, the

- 18 -

Company is requesting to pay more taxes than it used to do in
the past but we are of the view that the taxes are still not high
enough. Therefore, the Tax Department suggests that, every 5
years, we should ask for 5% more of what the company is
proposing but the amount should be close to the amount of taxes
paid by other companies to the Government with the following
breakdown:

[breakdown set out in Exhibit RE-05 omitted]

With respect to the request from the company, an advice from
the Prime Minister should be sought for his further
consideration and actions based on the attached report.

This report has been prepared for your information and further guidance.
Director General of Tax Department
Ms. Manivone Insisiengmai (Emphasis added)

47. On 5 August 2011, Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Jordahl (then a Sanum VP, and a lawyer) and
others from Sanum met with Ms. Manivone and her staff. Ms. Manivone reported that
she and the Tax Department found Notice 1121 to have misconceived at least in part
the arrangements with Sanum. The Tax Department supported the extension of
Sanum’s FTA on adjusted terms. Mr. Baldwin was given a copy of the 4 August 2011
memo (supra). The FTA recommendation is recorded on 16 August 2011 in the

minutes prepared by Ms. Manivone of the meeting of 5 August 201 11°

48. On 23 August 2011, Ms. Manivone wrote to the Minister of Finance to “report on the
meeting with Savan Vegas to discuss about the directive of the Government Secretariat
pursuant to the Notification No. 1121.” After reciting the tax arrangements with other
casinos in Laos, Ms. Manivone states:

The tax officers do not have experience in the audit and cannot identify

the source of revenue and expenses of this particular type of business.
[T]o ensure uniformity throughout the country all casinos are subject to

'° Exhibit RE-I1.

-19-

FTA because we have no experience. Therefore we propose that the
FTA be extended. (Emphasis added) n

I. Incorporation of the Claimant in Aruba, The Netherlands Antilles

49. On 17 July 2011, Mr. Richard Pipes, Vice President of Sanum, recommended to John
Baldwin, the CEO, that Sanum undertake a corporate restructuring under a Dutch entity
to take advantage of the Dutch/Lao Bilateral Investment Treaty (“BIT”) (Pipes II, para.
7). The Aruba company would become the new owner of Sanum and acquire 100% of

Sanum’s Lao investment.

50. The reorganization proceeded at a leisurely pace. On 29 December 2011, the Sanum

organization sent to IMC in Aruba a payment of $5,995 to establish Lao Holdings. R

51. On 17 January 2012, IMC used an off the rack company named Mula Blou Holdings
N.V., to form Lao Holdings N.V. in Aruba. 8

52. The Respondent says that Sanum did not inform the Lao Government Ministry of
Finance or the Prime Minister’s office that it had created a Netherlands company to

acquire Sanum’s investments.

J. The Minister of Finance Rejects Renewal of the Sayan Vegas FTA in Document
0772

53. On 24 August 2011, the Minister of Finance informed Ms. Manivone that the Tax

Department should hire an expert to advise it on how to audit and tax a casino

operation. 4

54. On 14 September 2011, the Tax Department published a new draft of the proposed
revision of the Tax Code based upon the proposal of the Laotian National Assembly in

its June session to raise the excise tax for casinos to 60% of revenue.

55. On 28 November 2011, Ms. Manivone sent Sanum a one page letter stating that
the Minister of Finance would not approve the extension of the FTA, but that
when the present agreement expired on 31 December 2013, “Savan Vegas and
Casino Co. Ltd. are to pay tax duties according to the regulated law on tax.”!°

However, the Lao Government acknowledged that any disposition of the Sanum

application would be subject to the approval of the Prime Minister’s office.!”

56. On 20 December 2011, the Laotian National Assembly passed the New Tax Code,

raising the excise tax on casino revenue to 80% of revenue.

57. On 28 December 2011, Mr. Pipes wrote a letter to the Prime Minister requesting an

extension of the FTA. He says his proposal was based on what he understood from

18

Ms. Manivone would be an acceptable schedule of tax payments.” Mr. Pipes was in

attendance at the hearing but, by arrangement between counsel, he did not provide oral

testimony.

58. On 11 January 2012, the Prime Minister’s office directed the Minister of Finance to

deal with the 28 December 2011 request from Mr. Pipes.

59. On 9 February 2012, the Deputy Minister of Finance was briefed on the latest Savan
Vegas FTA proposals:

Tax Department respectfully request you to review the report draft on the
Flat Tax payment requested by Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. from
2014-2054 to be reported to Prime Minister for consideration. Tax

'© Exhibit RE-14. The Ministry of Finance stated as follows:
Department of Tax hereby informs you regarding the Flat Tax Payment of Savan
Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd. As follows:

Agreement on Flat Tax Payment until expiration (until 31/12/2013)
2. After the expiration of Agreement on Flat Tax Payment (after 2013) on,

Department has completely amended to such report draft as you

Nothing in the 9 February 2012 document indicates that the Lao Government officials

considered the door to be closed to a renewal of the FTA on terms to be agreed to.

60. On 21 March 2012, there was a high level meeting attended by both the Prime Minister
and the Deputy Prime Minister as well as representatives from other Lao Government
departments. The Minutes of the meeting were filed with this Tribunal on 6 January
2014 as Exhibit C-332. There is no reference in the Minutes to any earlier Lao
Government “decision” taken in document 1121 of 10 June 2011 from the Prime
Minister’s office, or document 0772 of 28 November 2011 from the Minister of
Finance. It appears that there was a discussion in the Prime Minister’s office meeting
of the merits of the Claimant’s proposal, which according to the Minutes of the 21

March 2012 meeting was rejected in the following terms:

Regarding the proposal by Savan Vegas and Casino Company, Ltd. to
pay a flat tax during the years 2014 to 2054, the meeting agrees as
follows: 3.1. Continue to carry out the provisions of the contract
between the Government of the Lao PDR and Sanum Investments
Company, Ltd. (Savan Vegas and Casino Company, Ltd.) dated August
10, 2007. When the period specified in the contract for payment of
flat tax ends, the contract is to be revised to conform to the Tax
Laws of the Lao PDR.

Regarding payment of dividends from casino income, they are to be
divided by the formula of 30% for the state and 70% for the investors.
The 70% is to be divided according to the proportion of shares held.”°
61. This appears from the file to be the end of the written record of negotiations between

the Parties concerning the renewal of the FTA.

Ill. A GENERAL APPROACH TO THE TRIBUNAL’S JURISDICTION

A. Prerequisites for the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction

62.

63.

As was noted above, the Claimant is a company incorporated under the laws of Aruba,
The Netherlands. Article 13 of the BIT provides that in the case of The Netherlands
the term “national” under BIT Article 1(b)(ii) shall apply to enterprises incorporated in
Aruba. Hence, Lao Holdings N.V. is a national of The Netherlands, which has been an
ICSID Contracting State since October 14, 1966. Laos is not an ICSID Contracting
State. As such, this dispute was brought under ICSID’s Additional Facility Rules. The
Additional Facility establishes that the ICSID Secretariat may administer a proceeding
between a State and a national of another State in the following instances, among

others:

a. “conciliation and arbitration proceedings for the settlement of legal disputes arising
directly out of an investment which are not within the jurisdiction of the Centre
because either the State party to the dispute or the State whose national is a party to

the dispute is not a Contracting State; ie

Article 4 of the ICSID-AF Rules establishes, in relevant part:

“(1) Any agreement providing for conciliation or arbitration proceedings under the
Additional Facility in respect of existing or future disputes requires the approval of the
Secretary-General. The parties may apply for such approval at any time prior to the
institution of proceedings by submitting to the Secretariat a copy of the agreement
concluded or proposed to be concluded between them together with other relevant
documentation and such additional information as the Secretariat may reasonably

request.

(2) In the case of an application based on Article 2(a), the Secretary-General shall give
his approval only if (a) he is satisfied that the requirements of that provision are
fulfilled at the time, and (b) both parties give their consent to the jurisdiction of the

Centre under Article 25 of the Convention (in lieu of the Additional Facility) in the

2! Article 2(a) of the ICSID-AF Rules.

64.

65.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 185 of 457

-23-

event that the jurisdictional requirements ratione personae of that Article shall have

been met at the time when proceedings are instituted...”

In the present case the Tribunal must examine its jurisdiction in light of the above
Articles of the ICSID-AF Rules and the BIT. Under this analysis, for the Tribunal to

have jurisdiction four conditions must be satisfied:

- first, a condition ratione personae: one of the parties to the dispute must be a
Contracting State or a national of a Contracting State, while the other must

not be a Contracting State or a national of a Contracting State ;

second, a condition ratione materiae: the dispute must be a legal dispute

arising directly out of an investment;

- third, a condition ratione voluntatis: the parties must consent in writing that
the dispute be settled through ICSID-AF arbitration;

- fourth, a condition ratione temporis: the ICSID-AF Rules and the instrument

including the arbitration clause must be applicable at the relevant time.

No objection is taken to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the Parties or the subject
matter of the claim. Nor is the existence of the consent to arbitration of both Parties
contested. The Lao Government’s objection is taken solely to jurisdiction ratione
temporis. According to the Lao Government, the investor was not a national of The
Netherlands when the dispute over the New Tax Code arose. In its view, the “legal
dispute” over the application to Savan Vegas of the New Tax Code arose no later than
16 December 2011 when the Claimant received formal notice from the Prime
Minister’s office that the FTA would not be renewed. It followed, the Lao Government
contends, that the ordinary law governing taxes would apply from and after the expiry
of the five year FTA on 31 December 2013. The “legal dispute” can and did arise
before any taxes became due or payable. It arose more than a month before the
Claimant was incorporated in Aruba as an opportunistic device to provide Sanum with

access to the rights and remedies afforded by The Netherlands/Laos Treaty.

B. Burden of Proof

66.

67.

The Respondent acknowledges that, while “the Tribunal must ascertain that the
prerequisites for its jurisdiction are fulfilled and that the facts on which its jurisdiction
can be based are proven”, in terms of the present jurisdictional objection, the
Respondent accepts the burden of proving that the “legal dispute” arose before the

critical date.”*

In particular, the Respondent accepts the onus of establishing (i) that a legal dispute
existed and (ii) did so before 17 January 2012 and that the event(s) giving rise to the

dispute were (iii) neither continuous nor (iv) composite.

C. Abuse of process distinguished from objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis

68.

69.

While the Lao Government contends that Sanum’s “forum shopping” was an abuse of
proper Treaty procedure, it does not make the argument that the investor’s acquisition
of Dutch nationality was an abuse of process that entitles the Lao Government to a
dismissal of this entire arbitration. The Lao Government’s objection to the tax element
of the claim relies entirely on the general principle of non-retroactivity in the
application of international treaties. The sole asserted basis of denial of the jurisdiction

of the Tribunal over the New Tax Code issue is the principle of ratione temporis.

The Tribunal wishes to underline the distinction between these two quite different
forms of objections. The rationale for the doctrine of abuse of process was succinctly
set out in Phoenix Action Ltd. v. Czech Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5 as

follows:

The evidence indeed shows that the Claimant made an “investment” not
for the purpose of engaging in economic activity, but for the sole purpose
of bringing international litigation against the Czech Republic. This
alleged investment was not made in order to engage in national economic

2009 (hereinafter “Phoenix”), 4 64.

> The Respondent cites Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on

Jurisdiction, 1 June 2012 (hereinafter “Pac Rim”), {| 2.13:

“The Tribunal agrees that the burden lies on a claimant

 

who asserts a positive right and on a respondent who asserts a positive answer to the claimant.” (Emphasis

added)

-25-

activity, it was made solely for the purpose of getting involved with
international legal activity. The unique goal of the “investment” was to
transform a pre-existing domestic dispute into an international dispute
subject to ICSID arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty. This
kind of transaction is not a bona fide transaction and cannot be a
protected investment under the ICSID system.

It is the duty of the Tribunal not to protect such an abusive
manipulation of the system of international investment protection under
the ICSID Convention and the BITs. It is indeed the Tribunal’s view that
to accept jurisdiction in this case would go against the basic objectives
underlying the ICSID Convention as well as those of bilateral investment
treaties. The Tribunal has to ensure that the ICSID mechanism does not
protect investments that it was not designed for to protect ...

 

The Tribunal considers that it is clearly an abuse for an investor to manipulate the
nationality of a company subsidiary to gain jurisdiction under an international treaty at
a time when the investor is aware that events have occurred that negatively affect its
investment and may lead to arbitration. In particular, abuse of process must preclude
unacceptable manipulations by a claimant acting in bad faith who is fully aware prior

to the change in nationality of the “legal dispute,” as submitted by the Respondent.

The Respondent the Lao Government says the award in Venezuela Holdings B.V. and
others v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/O7/27 (2010) is
dispositive in its favour due to the factual similarity with the case at hand, although in
point of law, the Tribunal’s decision in that case turned explicitly on an allegation of
abuse of right. In fact, the tribunal in that case essentially ruled that it is an abuse to
change nationality after a dispute has arise, but that no such abuse exists when the
change of nationality has occurred after the dispute has arisen, in which case the rules
of ratione temporis application of the Treaty aloow the claim to be heard by the arbitral

tribunal.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 188 of 457

It was shown in that case that Mobil had made substantial investments in Venezuela
from 1999 to 2005. In 2004, Venezuela raised the royalty tax rate from 1% to 16.66 %.
Mobil said it was “surprised” at that development. In February and in May 2005,
Mobil wrote to the Government complaining of the rise in tax rates. Then in June
2005, Venezuela raised the rate to 30% by Ministerial decree and introduced a bill into
the legislature to raise it further to 50%. Mobil wrote on 20 June 2005 that the recent
raise “has broadened the investment dispute.” It requested negotiations to “reach an
amicable resolution of this matter.” The Tribunal concluded that: “It results from those
letters that in June 2005 there were already pending disputes between the Parties
relating to the increase of royalties and income taxes decided by Venezuela.”
Thereafter, “on 27 October 2005, Mobil created a new entity under the laws of the
Netherlands ...” That entity then acquired the Mobil companies that had been engaged
in Venezuela and “the Dutch Holding Company was thus inserted into the corporate

chain for the Cerro Negro and La Ceibo projects.”
On these facts, the Mobil Tribunal observed:

203. As recalled above, the restructuring of Mobil’s investments
through Dutch entity occurred from October 2005 to November
2006. At that time, there were already pending disputes relating
to royalties and income tax. However, nationalisation measures
were taken by the Venezuelan authorities only from January
2007 on. Thus, the dispute over such nationalisation measures
can only be deemed to have arisen after the measures were taken.

204. As stated by the Claimants, the aim of the restructuring of their
investments in Venezuela through a Dutch holding was to
protect those investments against breaches of their rights by the
Venezuelan authorities by gaining access to ICSID arbitration
through the BIT. The Tribunal considers that this was a
perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.
(Emphasis added)

The Tribunal then flagged the important distinction between the abuse of process
doctrine and an objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis. As to abuse of process, the

Tribunal stated:

205. With respect to pre-existing disputes, the situation is different
and the Tribunal considers that to restructure investments only in

-27-

order to gain jurisdiction under a BIT for such disputes would
constitute, to take the words of the Phoenix Tribunal, “an
abusive ipulation of the system of international investment
protection under the ICSID Convention and the BITs...

(Emphasis added).

However, as to an objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis, the Mobil Tribunal

continued:

... the Claimants seem indeed to be conscious of this, when they state
that they “invoke ICSID jurisdiction on the basis of the consent
expressed in the Treaty only for disputes arising under the Treaty for
action _that_the Respondent _took or continued _to_take after the
restructuring was completed. (Emphasis added)

The Tribunal in Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Savador, ICSID Case No.
ARB/09/12, explained clearly that the time frame corresponding to a finding of abuse
of process is not the same as the time frame corresponding to an objection ratione
temporis. More precisely, if a company changes its nationality in order to gain
ICSID jurisdiction at a moment when things have started to deteriorate so that a
dispute is highly probable, it can be considered an abuse of process, but for an
objection based on ratione temporis to be upheld, the dispute has to have actually
arisen before the critical date to conform to the general principle of non-

retroactivity in the interpretation and application of international treaties.
As far as abuse of process is concerned, the Pac Rim tribunal explained:

2.99 ... In the Tribunal’s view, the dividing-line occurs when the
relevant party can see an actual dispute or can foresee a specific
future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible
controversy. In the Tribunal’s view, before that dividing-line is reached,
there will be ordinarily no abuse of process; but after that dividing-line is
passed, there ordinarily will be. The answer in each case will, however,
depend upon its particular facts and circumstances, as in this case. As
already indicated above, the Tribunal is here more concerned with
substance than semantics; and it recognises that, as a matter of practical
reality, this dividing-line will rarely be a thin red line, but will include a
significant grey area. (Emphasis added)

The solution is different when the issue is based on an objection to jurisdiction ratione

temporis:

- 28 -

 

2.101. Ratione Temporis: The Tribunal considers that this approach as
regards the Abuse of Process issue is materially different from the
approach applicable to the Ratione Temporis issue, where both Parties
relied on the general principle of non-retroactivity for the interpretation
and application of international treaties.

2.104. Where there is an alleged practice characterised as a continuous
act ... which began before 13 December 2007 and continued thereafter,
this Tribunal would have jurisdiction ratione temporis over that portion
of the continuous act that lasted after that date, regardless of events or
knowledge by the Claimant before 13 December 2007. The Tribunal
concludes that this solution is different from that reached in its analysis
of the Abuse of Process issue, as here explained.

2.107. In the Tribunal’s view, the relevant date for deciding upon the
Abuse of Process issue must necessarily be earlier in time than the date
for deciding the Ratione Temporis issue.

79. In the present case, as in Phoenix, it is difficult to discern any fresh economic
investment arising out of the restructuring that would advance the purposes of the
Treaty which, according to its preamble, exists “to extend and intensify the economic
relations between th[e Parties], particularly with respect to investments by the nationals

of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party.”°°

80. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, provides that “[a] treaty
shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given
to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”
The Lao Government says the Claimant has simply taken over the existing investment
of Sanum, the Macaon company, and its insertion into the ownership structure was for

the purpose of legal tactics, not investment.

81. However, in this present case, the Lao Government does not advance the argument
that, as was the case in Phoenix, the abuse of process ought to result in a dismissal of

the entire arbitration. Its jurisdictional concern is solely with jurisdiction ratione

°6 Legal Authority CA-19.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 191 of 457

-29 -

temporis, i.e. the attempt to give retroactive effect to the Treaty at the instance of a
party not entitled to its protection. At paragraph 20 of its Objection dated 15 October
2013, the Lao Government states as follows:

Subsidiarily, Respondent argues that Claimant has proceeded in bad faith

in prosecuting its claim in the fashion it has done, and asks the Tribunal

to find as a fact that the proceeding with respect to the tax dispute

constitutes an abuse of process. Respondent notes that it does not

argue, as did Respondent in Pac Rim Cayman LLC v The Republic of El

Salvador,” that “abuse of process” is an independent ground for a

finding of a lack of jurisdiction. Rather Respondent urges the

Tribunal to make a finding on abuse of process solely for the

purpose of allocating fees and costs at the end of the arbitration,

following the guidance of the Tribunal in Phoenix Action Ltd. v. The

Czech Republic, which awarded all fees and costs to the Respondent in

that case based upon a finding of claimant’s abuse of the international

investment arbitration system. (Emphasis added)

82. The Lao Government’s position was reaffirmed on 6 January 2014 at the hearing on the

jurisdictional objection. The Lao Government seeks only that the Claimant’s alleged

“forum shopping” be taken into account in the disposition of arbitral costs.

83. In other words, in the present case, the question could have been discussed whether a
dispute was foreseeable before the change of nationality, if an objection had been
raised on the basis of an abuse of process. However, as the only objection to
jurisdiction was based on ratione temporis issues, the only task of the Tribunal is to
determine the moment when the dispute arose. If that moment — “the critical date” — is
before the change of nationality, then the Tribunal enjoys no jurisdiction; if, to the
contrary, the critical date is after the change of nationality, then the Tribunal can assert
jurisdiction.

IV.THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS OF THE OBJECTION TO JURISDICTION
RATIONE TEMPORIS

A. The Applicable Texts

84. Article 9 of the Lao/Netherlands Treaty deals with “legal disputes” and provides as

follows:

27 Pac Rim, supra note 23.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 192 of 457

-30-

Article 9 [legal dispute]

Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any legal dispute
arising between that Contracting Party and a national of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of that national in the
territory of the former Contracting Party to the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or
arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States. (Emphasis
added)

85. While there is no explicit temporal limit written into Article 9, such a time limit does

appear in relation to the making of a “claim” under Article 10:
Article 10 [claim]

The provisions of this Agreement shall, from the date of entry into force
thereof, also apply to investments, which have been made before that
date, but they shall not apply to any claim concerning an investment,
which arose before its entry into force. (Emphasis added)

86. The articles relevant to the determination of the present jurisdictional objection draw a
distinction between a “legal dispute” and a “claim.” This is not necessarily relevant, as
pointed out by the tribunal in Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain, CSTD
Case No. ARB/97/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000, 16 ICSID Review —
F.LLJ. 1, 33, para. 97 (2001):

While a dispute may have emerged, it does not necessarily have to
coincide with the presentation of a formal claim. The critical date will in
fact separate, not the dispute from the claim, but the dispute from prior
events that do not entail a conflict of legal views and interests.

B. The Lao Government’s Position on its Jurisdictional Objection

87. The Lao Government’s objection to the inclusion of the New Tax Code claim in this

arbitration may be summarized as follows:

(a) on 18 March 2011, Sanum made a request to extend its FTA;

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 193 of 457

-31-

(b

on 10 June 2011, the Prime Minister’s office rejected that request [by Notice 1121],
thus requiring Savan Vegas casino to pay taxes after the expiry of the FTA at the rates

in the tax code (that is when the tax dispute became a “fact”);

(c

Sanum tried through five months of subsequent negotiations to have that decision

reversed;

(d) Sanum was aware from 5 August 2011 that two other casinos in Laos had FTAs;

(e

Sanum’s negotiations attempting to reverse the Prime Minister’s office’s decision of
10 June 2011 ended, in any case, on 28 November 2011 when the Finance
Department notified Sanum [by Document 0772] that Sanum’s investments would be

subject to the tax code upon expiry of the current FTA;

(f) the New Tax Code was enacted on 20 December 2011, establishing that the new rate
for the excise tax on casino revenue would be 80%, thus fixing the “injury” alleged in

these proceedings; and

(g) the “legal dispute” thus predated the Claimant’s acquisition of Dutch nationality;

(hn)

the Claimant thus has no recourse under the Treaty.

In response to the Claimant’s contention that the dispute had not crystallized before the
change of nationality, counsel for the Lao Government contends that there were no
“negotiations” with anyone in a position of authority in 2012. Sanum’s letter of 28
December 2011 to the Prime Minister’s office, it says, was merely a unilateral offer to
negotiate. It is obvious, counsel for the Lao Government concludes, that a claimant
cannot delay the formation of a “legal dispute” by writing unilateral letters of

“proposals” that are meaningless.

Be that as it may, the Lao Government contends that, when Lao Holdings was
incorporated in Aruba on 17 January 2012, the “legal dispute” over the application of
the New Tax Code had plainly been disposed of adversely to Sanum by the Lao
Government, and the Treaty therefore has no application. Counsel for the Lao

Government put the point as follows:

90.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 194 of 457

-32-

The negotiations to attempt to reverse the Prime Minister’s Office’s June
10, 2011 decision ended on November 28, 2011 when the Tax
Department notified Sanum it would be subject to the tax code; and...
the new Tax Code was enacted on December 20, 2011, establishing that
the new rate for the excise tax on casino revenue would be 80%, thus
fixing the “injury” alleged in these proceedings. The operative
“disagreements on points of law and facts, conflict of legal views or of
interests” all arose before the “crucial date” of January 12 [sic, should
say 17], 2012.8

Hence, the Lao Government says the tax issue not only crystallized prior to the critical
date, but was resolved against the Claimant (at that time unprotected by the Treaty) by

the Lao Government prior to the critical date.

C. The Claimant’s Response to the Jurisdictional Objection

91.

92.

93.

94.

95.

The Tribunal notes that the Claimant disavows any contractual claim arising out of the
Lao Government’s refusal to extend the FTA or what the Claimant says are the Lao

Government’s failures to live up to its alleged promises to renegotiate the FTA.

Equally, the Claimant does not contest the enactment of the New Tax Code, as such.

At the enactment stage there was no “legal dispute.” 9

Having said that, the Claimant offers a “cascade” of responses, both legal and factual,

to the Lao Government’s objection.

Firstly, the Claimant says that under the Treaty there is no time limit on when an
investor can take a “legal dispute” to arbitration. Accordingly, it does not matter if the

“legal dispute” over the application of the New Tax Code arose in 2011 or 2012.

The Claimant argues that the difference between the wording of Article 9 and 10 shows
that the framers of the Treaty put their minds to “temporal” issues, and the absence in

Article 9 of an explicit time limit comparable to Article 10 must be given effect.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 195 of 457

- 33 -

96. The Claimant insists that it does not place any reliance on Article 10. The Claimant

invokes only the “legal dispute” provisions of Article 9.

97. Secondly, and in the alternative, if the Treaty is interpreted as containing an applicable
temporal limitation, the “legal dispute” over the application of the tax law did not arise
until after the negotiations for the renewal of the FTA collapsed (at the earliest) in
March 2012, well after the critical date. The Claimant cites the Micula tribunal for the

proposition that ‘*... the critical date is when the dispute arose rather than the date when

events and actions that may have given rise to the dispute took place.”*°

98. In his Fourth Witness Statement, sworn on 25 November 2013, Mr. Baldwin
acknowledges receipt on 16 December 2011 of the Ministry of Finance rejection, but
testifies that the rejection at the Ministerial level was understood by Sanum to be
simply a prelude to a review by the Prime Minister. He testified to the following
conversation with Ms. Manivone after receipt of Notice 0772, which, in his view,
simply confirmed that the locus of negotiations had now shifted from the Ministry of

Finance to the Prime Minister’s office:

Notice No. 0772 informed us that the Government had rejected our FTA
extension proposal. Although this notice was dated 28 November 2011,
we did not receive it until 16 December 2011 — this again is typical of
how the Lao Government operates. When we received this Notice, I was
surprised. I spoke with Madame Manivone about it, and she explained
that she was instructed by the Minister of Finance to issue it. She
assured me, however, that the FTA would nonetheless be extended,
and that she would help guide us through the process. She explained
that we would now have to go through the Prime Minister’s Office to
obtain approval for the FTA extension, and that we should resubmit our
proposal directly to the Prime Minister. So, later that month, we
submitted a new proposal to extend the FTA - containing the same
proposed flat tax payments as those recommended by Madame
Manivone in her 4 August 2011 report to the Minister of Finance — to the
Prime Minister. (para. 20, Emphasis added)

 

99. The inevitable question, of course, is whether Mr. Baldwin correctly recorded his

conversation with Ms. Manivone, and if so her intent in providing what he took to be

* Joan Micula , Viorel Micula and others v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Jurisdiction and
Admissibility, 24 September 2008, {| 155.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 196 of 457

-34-

assurances. The Lao Government did not adduce any evidence from Ms. Manivone to
dispute Mr. Baldwin’s evidence. Mr. Baldwin was present at the 6 January 2014
hearing in respect of the jurisdictional objection but by agreement of counsel (as will
be explained) Mr. Baldwin did not testify and was not cross-examined. His evidence

was taken as read.
100. The Fourth Baldwin Statement continued:

Throughout early 2012, we believed that our latest proposal for extension
of the FTA was under active consideration by the Government. Indeed, I
discussed the extension of Savan Vegas’s FTA on multiple occasions
during this time period with Dr. Sinlavong, the Minister to the Prime
Minister’s Office. (Emphasis added)

101.

The Lao Government filed an affidavit by Dr. Sinlavong dated 9 December 2013
stating that “Mr. Baldwin has contacted me many times to discuss his investments in
Laos” (para. 4). His redacted statement does not disclose the content or timing of those
discussions.*! The Claimant requested that Dr. Sinlavong be produced at the hearing of
6 January 2014 for cross-examination, but Dr. Sinlavong did not appear. Counsel for
the Lao Government advised the Tribunal that Dr. Sinlavong had failed to make a

timely visa application to the French Embassy.

102. The Lao Government points out the lack of any written communication from the Lao
Government corroborating the version of ongoing “negotiations” testified to by Mr.
Baldwin and Mr. Pipes, and it says that the documentation that does exist contradicts

rather than confirms their testimony.

+! In the Claimant’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 23 December 2013 it is said at | 45:

45. In addition, a document produced by Respondent and recently translated by
Claimant shows that Dr. Sinlavong — who now claims to “have never spoken to
anyone on the issue related to the extension of the flat tax” — actually issued an
official notice calling for Savan Vegas’s exemption from the New Tax Law in
March 2012. Notice No. 728/GO, dated 28 March 2012 and signed by Dr.
Sinlavong, advised the Ministers of Finance and Planning and Investment:
“When the Flat Tax Agreement expires, the new Agreement must be amended
according to the Law on Tax of the Lao PDR (subject to the accounting entry
system).” More specifically, the Notice states that “benefits sharing obtaining
[sic] from Casino Income [should be]. . . divided according to the State formula
namely 30% and the investor gets 70% of the total income,” as an alternative to
the 80% demand on revenues established under the New Tax Law.

 

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 197 of 457

-35-

103. The Lao Government says that the 28 December 2011 “proposal” was not even a good
faith offer to negotiate. The yearly payments listed in Mr. Pipes’ letter were lower than
the 18 March 2011 proposal the Lao Government had previously rejected. In response,
Mr. Baldwin testified that:

Moreover, the terms of the December proposal, as was the case with
every proposal, reflected what we were told at the time had the best
chance of being accepted by the Lao Government. It makes no sense for
us to have submitted a proposal we did not believe in good faith would
be accepted by the Lao Government — our goal was to obtain an
extension of the FTA. [Statement dated 25 November 2013, para. 22]

104. Moreover, the Claimant contends that whatever “legal dispute” existed prior to
March 2012 related to the old tax law, which was at a much lower rate, and not to the
New Tax Code enacted on 20 December 2011 but which did not come into effect until
October 2012, and could not have been applied to the Claimant in any event until the
expiry of Sanum’s FTA on 31 December 2013, long after the critical date of 17 January
2012.

105. The Claimant argues that the “tax laws of the Lao PDR” mentioned in Exhibit C-332”
must refer to something other than the New Tax Code because if an 80% tax were
imposed on revenue (plus 10% VAT) the next paragraph makes no sense because there

would be no dividends to divide.
106. The Claimant, in its 2 August 2013 submission, contends the following:

In March 2012, after Sanum and Savan Vegas learned that members of
the Government were opposed to their latest proposal for extension, they
withdrew their proposal. Nevertheless, Government officials continued
to state even after that point that agreement on the FTA could be reached
before the expiry of Sanum’s FTA and the new casino tax would not be
applied to Savan Vegas.**

107. Also, according to the Claimant, the Lao Government did not threaten the Claimant
with the new 80% tax on casino revenue until after the Claimant delivered its Notice to

Arbitrate herein on 12 August 2012. Prior to that date, there had been “no

confrontation of the points of view of the Parties” on that legal issue. In its application
for Provisional Measures dated 19 April 2013, the Claimant first identified the risk of
the application to it of the “80% tax on gaming revenues.” On 12 July 2013, the Lao

Government affirmed its intention to impose the New Tax Code and stated:

Absent any proof that a tax would be “confiscatory”, claimant is not
entitled to Provisional Measures blocking enforcement of a tax passed in
a tax code. (para. 1)

108. The Claimant contends that the New Tax Code did not become a “legal dispute”
between the Parties until it was raised in 2013 in the context of the Claimant’s Request

for Provisional Measures.

109. The Claimant says that in the Provisional Measures proceeding, the Respondent
asserted for the first time (and the Claimant subsequently denied), that Savan Vegas
would be subject to the New Tax Code. Thus, the Claimant argues, the “legal dispute”
over the application of the New Tax Code did not in fact crystallize until July 2013.
The Order for Provisional Measures dated 17 September 2013 granted a measure of
protection to the Claimant from the New Tax Code by way of an escrow arrangement.
The terms of the Provisional Measures decision are not otherwise at issue in the present

application. 4

* As to the Provisional Measures the Tribunal enjoined:

“the Lao Government from (a) demanding that Claimant pay any amounts
allegedly due pursuant to the New Tax Law; and (b) instituting or further
pursuing any action, judicial or otherwise, to collect any payments Respondent
claims are owed by Claimant pursuant to the New Tax Law; (b) enjoins the Lao
PDR from taking any enforcement action, judicial or otherwise, to seize or
interfere in the operations of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal slot clubs based
on any disputed tax amounts; (3) enjoins the Lao PDR from taking any action,
judicial or otherwise, to freeze or seize funds that Claimant or its related entities
place in accounts in the Lao banking system; and ( 4) these orders are under the
condition that the Claimant deposits in an escrow account at a Singapore bank
or other bank satisfactory to the parties under arrangements negotiated by the
parties and approved by the Tribunal, the amount of US$429,330 on the first
day of each month commencing I January 2014. (5) enjoins both parties from
taking any steps that would alter the status quo ante, or aggravate the dispute.”

  

On 16 December 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that both Parties had reached an agreement on the
escrow arrangements to be established in accordance with the Tribunal’s 17 September 2013 Decision on Claimant's
Amended Application for Provisional Measures. The Tribunal confirmed this agreement on 23 December 2013.

. Therefore, it was not until 12 July 2013, according to the Claimant, that the present

“legal dispute” arose.

Finally, the application of the New Tax Code is a continuing measure that will affect

the Claimant’s investments from and after 1 January 2014, and each assessment will

 

give rise to a new claim or legal dispute. It is therefore an issue that the Tribunal

should deal with.

In any event, according to the Claimant, no “claim” has yet been made against Savan
Vegas under the New Tax Code, which did not become law until October 2012, and
which could not as a matter of law apply to Savan Vegas until the FTA expired on 31
December 2013 (four days before the hearing of this jurisdictional objection). If, and
when a “claim” is made against the Claimant under the New Tax Code, by way of
assessment, demand or otherwise, there will arise a “claim” capable of being referred to
arbitration (if necessary) under Article 10, but, says the Claimant, no such “claim” is

yet in existence.

D. The Tribunal’s Analysis of the Claimant’s First Response to the Objection Ratione
Temporis: Namely that the Treaty Contains No Ratione Temporis Limitation

113

114.

. The Tribunal does not accept the argument that there is no temporal limit in relation to
Article 9 and that any party may at any time refer to arbitration “legal disputes” that
were dealt with before the investor’s accession to the Treaty (leaving aside events that

form elements of continuing or composite disputes).

The general principle of non-retroactivity is expressed in Article 28 of the Vienna

Convention on the Law of Treaties as follows:

“Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise
established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact
which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of
the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.”

- 38 -

It cannot be said that the silence of Article 9 with respect to a temporal limit “clearly”
manifests a “different intention” apparent on the face of the Treaty.*> The fact (as the
Claimant points out) that Laos and The Netherlands used different language in different
treaties does not alter the fact that nothing in this Treaty contemplates that investors
such as the Claimant could change their nationalities at will by artful corporate
restructurings to “forum shop” after a legal dispute has arisen with the same investor on
the same issue and had therefore become, in the words of the Paushok tribunal,*° a
“discrete event in the course of relations [between the Parties]” that predated the

Treaty.”

The general presumption favours non-retroactivity and in this Treaty the presumption is

not displaced by any different intention “apparent” on its face.

The Tribunal does not view the Treaty as intending to provide legal weapons to
investors for the purpose of re-engaging in a pre-existing legal dispute with the Lao

Government.

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent is entitled to raise the

objection ratione temporis to its assertion of a “legal dispute” under Article 9.

The question, therefore, is when did the tax dispute arise?

996 Commentaries to the Draft Articles of the Law of Treaties, the International Law Commission stated:
There is nothing to prevent the Parties from giving a treaty, or some of its
provisions, retroactive effect if they think fit. It is essentially a question of their
intention. The general rule however is that a treaty is not to be treated as
intended to have retroactive effects unless such an intention is expressed in the
treaty or was clearly to be implied from its terms. (Emphasis added)

E. The Tribunal’s Analysis of the Claimant’s Second Response to the Respondent’s
Objection, Namely that the “Legal Dispute” Over the New Tax Code Did Not Arise
Between the Parties Until After the Critical Date of 17 January 2012

1. Definition of a “Legal Dispute”

120. Both Parties accept as appropriate the definition of “dispute” formulated by the

Permanent Court of International Justice in the Mavrommatis case*” at page 11:

A dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal
views or of interests between two persons.

121. To which the tribunal in Victor Pey Casado v. Chile,*® added:

In order to establish the existence of such a dispute, “it must be shown
that the claim of one of the Parties meets obvious opposition from the
other.” (para. 441)

Gs)

It is only with the expression and the confrontation of the points of view
of the Parties that the dispute is crystallized. (para. 443)

2. When did the dispute arise? The contentions of the Parties and the Tribunal’s
findings

122. The Claimant contests the Lao Government’s position that the end of the FTA renewal
negotiations (whatever date that might be) triggered a “legal dispute” about the
application of the New Tax Code. The Claimant says the two disputes are distinct and
separate. However, the Tribunal agrees with the Lao Government that the issues are
linked. In the situation confronting the Parties in 2011 and 2012, Sanum clearly
understood that it would be subject to the ordinary law of Laos, including the Tax
Code, unless affirmatively exempted by the extension of its FTA. Sanum opposed the
application to its investments of the ordinary tax laws on the basis of various alleged

Lao Government representations and understandings regarding renewal of the FTA,

and assurances from Lao Government officials that it was never their intention to apply
the New Tax Code to existing investments such as Savan Vegas. In the Tribunal’s
view, the link between the FTA extension and the tax issue, while sequential, is clear,
with the result that the treatment of the tax aspects of Sanum’s business can be

considered as a continuous behaviour.

Sanum’s objective in the negotiations was to avoid the application of the ordinary tax
laws. Whether or not at that time Sanum had formulated a detailed challenge to the
application of the tax law to its investments and the implication of constantly
increasing rates of tax being considered by the legislative power, does not detract from
the direct link between a failure of the FTA negotiations and the consequent triggering

of the tax dispute.

The Parties agree that the test for determining the critical date is objective and that the
relevant question is not whether the Lao Government subjectively believed the legal
dispute to have arisen, or whether the Claimant subjectively believed it had not, the
question is whether the facts, objectively analysed, establish the existence of a dispute
and if so at what time did it arise, and was it resolved (as the Lao Government argues)

before the Treaty came into force as between the Lao Government and the Claimant?

In early 2011, the Ministry of Finance decided to undertake a revision of the Tax Code
under the supervision of the Director General of the Tax Department, Ms. Manivone

Insixiengmai, as related above.

Counsel for the Respondent emphasizes that flat tax agreements are also made to serve
the Lao Government’s interest, not only investor’s. If the Lao Government’s
assessment of the benefit changes, the rationale for the Flat Tax, from its point of view,

may disappear.

Certainly, Ms. Manivone consistently took the view in her memoranda that the Finance
Tax Department had only 15 auditors to audit all the largest companies in Laos and she

believed that her department lacked not only the human resources but the expertise to

* Exhibit

*° Mr. Bounnam’s lack of knowledge of relevant events is evident from his witness statement, for example:

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 203 of 457

-41-

audit a casino, a cash based business.*? She pushed hard for a renewal of the Sanum
FTA, and made no secret of the Tax Department’s views in her dealings with the

Claimant.

From the Claimant’s perspective, it needed certainty about future tax treatment if it
were to be able to arrange for long term financing to expand its gambling operations in
Laos. The financial prospects of the company, and therefore its potential attraction as
an investment, were linked, inter alia, to its exposure to an escalation of Laotian taxes

over the life of the concession.

The evidence shows that, in the months following Sanum’s request for a renewal of the
FTA, there was disagreement within the Lao Government over the advantages and

disadvantages of extending Sanum’s FTA.

The Prime Minister’s office was actively involved in the file at least by 10 June 2011
when it issued Notice 1121. The document, in the Tribunal’s view, is ambiguous (as
previously discussed). It cannot reasonably be interpreted, on the present state of the
record, as a decision rejecting Sanum’s request for a new FTA. But it establishes that

the Jocus for the making of the final decision was at the Prime Ministerial level.

Ms. Manivone, who was a central figure in the Sanum negotiations, does not appear to
have treated Notice 1121 as a rejection, and her conduct thereafter (as disclosed by the

Lao Government documents) is not consistent with that view.

The Lao Government did file a witness statement from Mr. Bounnam Chounlaboudy,
who in June 2011 was Director of the Legislative Division of the Tax Department, but
it is apparent from his statement that he was only peripherally involved (if at all) in the

Sanum negotiations.“ Mr. Bounnam does describe Notice 1121 as a denial of Sanum’s

tt RE-O1, 410.

14. I was aware that Mrs. Manivone had discussions with her staff about the
Savan Vegas’ request for an extended Flat Tax Agreement during the summer
2011.

15. I was aware that Mrs. Manivone directed her staff to write a report
addressed to the Minister of Finance. It is dated August 4, 2011.

request, but his conclusory statement is unsupported by any explanation or analysis of
the text (neither the Laotian text nor the English text). In light of the unsatisfactory
state of the evidentiary record, the Claimant requested Mr. Bounnam be produced at the

6 January 2014 hearing for cross-examination but he failed to appear.

133. The Lao Government explained that Mr. Bounnam was unable to obtain a French visa
because of his last-minute application and the holiday schedule of the French Embassy
in Laos.*! However, in the Tribunal’s view, there was no justification for leaving the
visa application until the last minute. The hearing date for 6 January 2014 had been
fixed more than 3 months earlier by the Tribunal’s bifurcation order dated 23
September 2013. It was evident at the 23 September 2013 hearing that there were
sharp differences between the Parties on some of the facts central to the Lao
Government’s own jurisdictional objection. In the absence of a waiver by the Claimant
of its right to cross-examine the Lao Government’s deponents, it was up to the Lao
Government to have its witnesses available for cross-examination either at the hearing

or at some prior occasion under arrangements satisfactory to the Parties.*”

134. In light of Mr. Bounnam’s failure to appear, and the lack of any evidence from Ms.
Manivone, as well as the lack of clarity in the English text, the Tribunal declines to
treat Notice 1121 dated 10 June 2011 as a “decision” to reject the Sanum
application, which could have triggered the dispute which is in front of the

Tribunal.

135. There is no doubt, in any event, that Ms. Manivone and the Tax Department continued

to negotiate with Sanum on an open-ended basis.

 

16. I was informed that Mrs. Manivone held a meeting with her staff and Sanum
staff on August 5, 2011.
17. Twas informed that Mrs. Manivone told Mr. Baldwin that she would submit
the Tax Department's recommendation directly to the Minister of Finance.

Document 0772 dated 28 November 2011 on the other hand, clearly documents a

decision to reject Sanum’s application, but only at the level of the Minister of Finance.

On the Lao Government’s view, the Flat Tax issue was dead as of 28 November 2011
(or at least by 16 December 2011 when Sanum acknowledged receipt of a copy of
document 0772). At that point, if not earlier, the Lao Government says, Sanum was
exposed to the ordinary tax rate, and any “legal dispute” about the New Tax Code arose

at that time — at least a month before the critical date of 17 January 2012.

The Tribunal agrees with the Lao Government that, if the Sanum Flat Tax issue were
shown to have been concluded in or before December 2011, the “legal dispute” over
the New Tax Code ought to be held to have arisen prior to the critical date of 17
January 2012, despite the Claimant’s view that greater formality would ordinarily be

required to turn a potential legal dispute into an actual legal dispute.

However, both Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Pipes have provided sworn testimony to
demonstrate a reasonable expectation that the decision of the Minister of Finance was
just a stepping stone in a longer process. In his Fourth Witness Statement dated 25

October 2013, Mr. Baldwin testifies:

Notice No. 0772 informed us that the Government had rejected our FTA
extension proposal. Although this notice was dated 28 November 2011,
we did not receive it until 16 December 2011 — this again is typical of
how the Lao Government operates. When we received this Notice, I was
surprised. I spoke with Madame Manivone about it, and she
explained that she was instructed by the Minister of Finance to issue
it. She assured _me, however, that the FTA would nonetheless be
extended, and that she would help guide us through the process. She
explained that we would now have to go through the Prime
Minister’s Office to obtain approval for the FTA extension, and that
we should resubmit our proposal directly to the Prime Minister. So, later
that month, we submitted a new proposal to extend the FTA — containing
the same proposed flat tax payments as those recommended by Madame
Manivone in her 4 August 2011 report to the Minister of Finance — to the
Prime Minister. (para. 20, Emphasis added)

  

. Mr. Baldwin was available for cross-examination at the 6 January 2014 hearing. Ms.

Manivone was not.

143.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 206 of 457

-44-

. Mr. Bounnam says in his first Sworn Statement that:

22. In January 2012, the Tax Department received a message from the
Prime Minister’s office, dated January 10, referring to another request
from Sanum to extend the FTA. I have reviewed this document.

His redacted Statement sheds no light on what transpired in January 2012. In a further
Sworn Statement dated 9 December 2013, Mr. Bounnam refers to work he did in
relation to a letter from the Vice-Minister of Finance to the Prime Minister’s office
dated 10 February 2012 (i.e. after the critical date of 17 January 2012). However, if
anything, his testimony simply indicates ongoing preparation for the meeting convened
by the Prime Minister on 21 March 2012 to discuss Sanum’s FTA proposal. Mr.
Bounnam’s statements raise more questions than they provide answers. This is not to
say that Mr. Bounnam is to be disbelieved. However, his evidence is largely based on
hearsay, is vague and uncertain in content, and (absent cross-examination) raises too
many questions to be relied on by the Lao Government to establish that the FTA

negotiations ended in December 2011.

Therefore, the Tribunal does not consider the letter of 28 November 2012 as a
“decision” to reject Sanum’s application, which could have triggered the dispute

which is in front of the Tribunal.

Mr. Pipes’ Second Witness Statement sworn 2 August 2013 states that, even after the
meeting with the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister on 21 March 2012, Sanum
was led to believe that the FTA extension was still a live issue within the Lao

Government.

In March of 2012, we learned that members of the Government were
opposed to our most recent proposal to extend the Savan Vegas Flat Tax
Agreement, and we withdrew our proposal. But even after March 2012,
we continued to believe that we would succeed in coming to an
acceptable agreement for extension of the Flat Tax Agreement based on
clear statements by Government representatives to that effect. Because
of those statements, and also because of other reassurances we had
received from various Government officials that the new casino tax
would not be applied to Savan Vegas, we believed that we would
eventually resolve the issue presented by the new casino tax before
the current Flat Tax Agreement expired. (para. 11, Emphasis added)

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 207 of 457

-45-

144. Mr. Pipes thus refers to discussions of some sort after March 2012. However, Mr.
Pipes is not specific about his “sources”, nor does he identify the “Government
officials” referred to, and this substantially lessens the weight of his testimony. This
being said, from a jurisdictional perspective, the question whether the FTA negotiations
continued after March 2012 is of little relevance. The Tribunal’s concern is with 17
January 2012. In any event, to the extent the evidence of Mr. Pipes on this point was
considered by the Lao Government to be of significance, he was present and available
for cross-examination at the 6 January 2014 hearing and could have been cross-
examined on those issues. This eventuality was avoided by the agreement of counsel,

as explained below.

145. However, for present purposes, the Tribunal puts no weight on whatever may
subsequently have been said by the anonymous “Government officials” referred to but

not identified by the Claimant.

146. It results from this analysis that it appears to the Tribunal on the analysis of the
Claimant’s evidence that the dispute arose on 21 March 2012, when the final
decision not to grant a new FTA to Sanum was adopted at the highest level, in
other words, that the dispute arose after the critical date. It remains to verify
whether the Lao Government has adduced credible contrary evidence on when the

dispute arose.

3. The Failure of the Lao Government to Produce Satisfactory Factual Evidence on
When a “Legal Dispute” Arose with Respect to the New Tax Code

147. Ms. Manivone would have been able to provide crucial evidence with respect to the
Sanum negotiations, and in particular their progress (or lack of it) within the Lao
Government, but, despite the Lao Government’s initial statement that it would provide

. - : . . 3
a witness statement from Ms. Manivone, none was ever provided to the Tribunal. 4

3 Initially, the Tribunal was told no such statement was filed because “Ms. Manivone has left the country on
holiday,” (16 October 2013) and subsequently, on 11 December 2013, the Tribunal was advised that Ms. Manivone
“had to accompany her husband, a Lao senior soldier, to Vietnam on official business.

 

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 208 of 457

- 46 -

148. The Respondent instead chose to file witness statements from more peripheral Lao
Government officials, including Mr. Bounnam (who as mentioned was not involved in
the Sanum negotiations at the relevant time), as well as Mr. Souralay and Minister

Sinlavong, neither of whom could shed much light on the actual state of negotiations.

149. On Friday 3 January 2014, three days before the hearing called to consider its own
objection to jurisdiction, which had been scheduled three months before, the
Respondent Lao Government advised the Tribunal that none of Mr. Bounnam, Mr.
Souralay or Minister Sinlavong would be available for cross-examination on their

witness statements.

150. As stated, both Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Pipes for the Claimant were available on 6

January 2014 for cross-examination.

151.

Eventually counsel for the Parties reached an agreement that the Claimant’s witness
statements would be taken as read, some of the Laotian witness statements would be
redacted, but as redacted would remain in evidence, that the two Laotian witness
statements in respect of which the Claimant had waived cross-examination would be

entered in full, and that no cross-examination would take place of anybody.

+ The arrangement was put on the record in the 6 January 2014 Hearing Transcript, pp. 1-3:

MR BRANSON: I made a proposal; Mr Rivkin accepted it. I will let him
explain it.

MRRIVKIN: Yes, I will explain the proposal and let me explain our
thinking about it a little bit as well. The agreement we
reached was that because Mr Branson has not arranged for any
of his witnesses to be here for cross-examination, he will not
cross-examine Mr Baldwin. All of the witness statements may
be taken into the record, but Mr Branson proposed that we be
able to redact certain portions of the witness statements of the
three witnesses who did not appear for cross-examination. We
had some back and forth yesterday and agreed on which
sections would or would not be redacted. So we can provide -

PRESIDENT: — Of the Respondent's witnesses?

MR RIVKIN: Yes. Mr Baldwin's witness statements are in in full.

PRESIDENT: Although he is not being cro:

MR RIVKIN: Although he is not being cross-examined. The two witnesses
whom we had decided not to cross, their witness statements
are in in full. And the four witness statements by the three
witnesses who were not brought for cross-examination can be

 

xamined?

155.

. Nevertheless, counsel agreed that:

... neither side accepts the truth of what's in the witness statements, even
the redacted witness statements, and we will have an opportunity to
discuss that in our presentations, of course.

. The Tribunal, of course, accepts the agreement of counsel with respect to the
testimony. As a result of counsel’s agreement, the Tribunal does not draw any adverse
inferences regarding the witnesses on either side. However, the Tribunal is still left
with the problem of the onus of proof. Has the Lao Government proven, as it set out
to do, that the legal dispute regarding the application of the New Tax Code arose prior
to the critical date of 17 January 2012? In the Tribunal’s view, the Lao Government

has not discharged its onus of proof of the facts.

In particular, the Tribunal is of the view that the Lao Government has failed to
discharge its burden of proof to establish that the negotiations to renew the FTA had
come to an end — and that therefore the application of the “New Tax Code” had become
a “legal dispute” between the Parties as of the critical date - namely 17 January 2012.
In fact, on the contrary, it would appear on the current record that the Sanum Flat Tax
proposal was very much alive at the meeting in the Prime Minister’s office on 21

March 2012.

A similar situation existed in the Pac Rim case, where negotiations continued after the
date when the Claimant considered that a dispute had arisen because of a “final” refusal

of a gold exploitation permit:

 

admitted as redacted, and we will provide you with those
redacted copies now.
(.)

PRESIDENT: Alright. Mr Branson, do you have anything to add to that?

MR BRANSON: Yes, I think it was irrelevant. I made the proposal so that both
Parties would have equal treatment at the hearing. If they
can't cross-examine our witnesses, then I shouldn't cross-
examine their witnesses, so we have equal treatment. I also
proposed that they could redact sections if they believed they
might have been able to impeach, so that it would be equal on
both sides. And I trust that our agreement signifies that there
is equal treatment, and that one party won't be able to allege
later that there was not equal treatment. That was the purpose
of the proposal and the purpose of the acceptance.

157.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 210 of 457

2.83. The Tribunal has taken particular note of the Claimant’s belief that
it received indications from the Salvadoran authorities, to the effect that
the different permits and authorisations could yet be granted to its
Enterprises. According to the Claimant, even if there were theoretical
legal circumstances under which a government agency’s failure to meet a
statutory deadline could give rise to a dispute between an investor and
the Respondent, the conduct in this particular case of MARN, the
Bureau of Mines and other government officials led the Claimant
reasonably to understand that even though deadlines had been
missed by these authorities, PRES‘s applications for a permit and a
concession remained under consideration by the Salvadoran
authorities. Therefore, so the Claimant contends, having induced it to
understand that despite the missed deadlines in 2004 or 2007 there was
no dispute between the Parties, the Respondent is now effectively
precluded, as a matter of law, from here arguing that the missed
deadlines triggered the present dispute between the Claimant and the
Respondent before December 2007.

 

2.84. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s submissions. It also notes that,
even after March 2008, there were discussions between the Claimant and
the Salvadoran authorities. In the Notice of Intent, it was specifically
pleaded that: “(ijn 2008, President Elias Antonio Saca was reported as
having publicly stated that he opposed the granting of any outstanding
mining permits. In light of President Saca’s comments and the
Government’s actions and inactions, the Enterprises engaged in several
meetings with the Government in 2008 seeking approval of the necessary
permits.” Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the alleged omission
to grant a permit and concession was not completely finalised before
13 December 2007, because even at that time there still seemed to be
a reasonable possibility, as understood by the Claimant, to receive
such permit and concession notwithstanding the passage of time.
(Emphasis added)

In other words, the case at hand presents a similar situation, because (to track the
language of the Pac Rim decision) the Lao Government has failed to demonstrate that
the FTA negotiations had been finalized before 17 January 2012 and even at that time
there still seemed a reasonable possibility as understood by the Claimant, basing itself
on objective facts, that such negotiations would lead to a renewal of the FTA on
mutually satisfactory terms. On the record before the Tribunal the negotiations

continued until 21 March 2012.

It is unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide whether the FTA issue died as a result of

the decision taken by the Prime Minister on that date.

V. DISPOSITION BY THE TRIBUNAL OF THE RESPONDENT’S OBJECTION TO
JURISDICTION RATIONE TEMPORIS

158. The Tribunal rejects the jurisdictional challenge on the basis that the Lao Government

has not met the burden of showing that a legal dispute with respect to the application of

the New Tax Code had arisen on or before the critical date of 17 January 2012. The

Tribunal concludes on the present record that the FTA negotiations continued after that

date and, until those negotiations ended, the application of the New Tax Code was a

mere possibility that was not yet ripe for a “legal dispute” to arise.

VI. DISPOSITION OF APPLICATION FOR COSTS

159. The Tribunal does not see fit to make any award of costs at this stage of the

proceeding.

Vil. ISSUES NOT DECIDED BY THE TRIBUNAL

160. In light of its disposition of the Flat Tax issue, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to
decide — and it does not decide — with regard to the Claimant’s alternate arguments in
opposition to the jurisdictional objection. The Tribunal also wishes to be clear that it
makes no findings of fact in relation to the dispute other than those necessary to the
consideration and disposal of the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione
temporis.

L OVERVIEW

1. The Claimant, Lao Holdings N.C., owns gambling assets in Laos including the
Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino Complex in Savannakhet Province. It is strategically
located near the Friendship Bridge which spans the Mekong River, between Laos and
Thailand. As a result of what it considered to be investment treaty violations, the Claimant,
a company incorporated under the laws of Aruba in the Netherlands Antilles, initiated
proceedings on 14 August 2012 against the Respondent, the Government of The Lao
People’s Democratic Republic (the “Government”), before the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID). The claim was made pursuant to the
Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and
the Kingdom of the Netherlands!, and the Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of

ICSID.?

2. The Claimant’s original ICSID claims were based on a multiplicity of the
Respondent Government’s actions, including an 80 % tax on casino revenues and what the
Claimant contended were unfair and oppressive audits of its Savan Vegas Hotel and
Casino. The Claimant eventually valued its investment loss at between USD 690 million

and USD 1 billion.

' Signed on 16 May 2003, in force since | May 2005.

2 As amended on 10 April 2006.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 217 of 457

3. The ICSID claims were resolved by a Deed of Settlement concluded between the
parties during the merits hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014 (to be read together with a

Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to collectively as “the Settlement”).

4. The Claimant now alleges a “material breach” of the Settlement by the Government

which, it says, justifies the Tribunal in reviving the pre-settlement ICSID claims.

5. The Claimant’s core allegation is that subsequent to the Settlement, the
Government infringed the Claimant’s gambling monopoly rights by approving and
granting permission for the establishment of a rival casino or casinos within its area of
exclusivity. The Government undertook in Article 13 thereof to facilitate the sale of the
Claimant’s gambling assets in Laos “on a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds to the
Claimants and Laos”. Instead, according to the Claimant, the Government’s approval of a
rival casino or casinos has so substantially destroyed the potential value of the Savan Vegas
Hotel and Casino in the eyes of potential investors as to frustrate (and terminate) the

Settlement.

6. The Claimant offers no direct evidence of such approval. Instead it has produced a
variety of items of circumstantial evidence, including media reports, blogs, the continuing
operation of a rival slot club or clubs in the Claimant’s territory and activities of private
individuals and entities (not the Government) from all of which, the Claimant argues,

Government approval can be inferred.

7. The important question arises as to whether any of the conduct of various private
entities (including a corporation in which the Government holds a minority 30% interest)
which promoted creation of a potential rival casino can be attributed to the Government.

3

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 218 of 457

8. If the Tribunal is persuaded on the attribution issue, the further question arises as
to whether the Government “cured” the alleged default within 45 days “after receipt of
notice of such breach” as permitted by Article 32 of the Settlement, by making it clear that
no rival casino would be permitted in the Claimant’s territory during the balance of the 50

year life of the Claimant’s concession.

9. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction to revive the ICSID claims is conferred (and limited) by
Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement which reads in part (as clarified by the Side Letter),

as follows:>

The Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that
Laos is in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above and only
after reasonable written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach
and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such
breach. (emphasis added)

10. For reasons that follow, the Tribunal is of the view that even accepting arguendo

the interpretation of the Deed of Settlement most favourable to the Claimant, the evidence

5 The full text of Article 32 as clarified by the Side Letter reads as follows:

Article 32

The Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that Laos is
in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above and only after reasonable
written notice is given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach and such breach is not
remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach. The Sale Deadline and any
other relevant time periods herein shall be extended by the length of time required to
cure such breach. In the event that there is a dispute as to whether or not Laos is in material
breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above, the Tribunals shall determine
whether or not there has been such a material breach and shall only revive the
arbitration if they conclude that there has been such a material breach.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 219 of 457

fails to establish on a balance of probabilities that the Government itself, directly or
indirectly, “approved and granted” permission for a rival casino contrary to the Claimant’s

contractual entitlement.

11. The Tribunal notes the Claimant’s contention that against a sovereign state a
Claimant “is often unable to furnish direct proof of facts giving rise to responsibility”
because, as the Claimant argues, such evidence is often “exclusively within the control of
the Government”.* Nevertheless where, as here, the Claimant’s case is based on
“inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence” (see Claimant’s Submission, 27 March
2014, at para. 27) a Tribunal must be careful not to shift the onus of proof from the Claimant
to the Respondent Government or to bend over backwards to read in inferences against

“the sovereign state” that are simply not justified in the context of the whole case.

12. Further, even if it were accepted, arguendo, that some of the evidence is suggestive
of some sort of “tacit” signal of approval to rival entrepreneurs, all of which is denied by
the Government, it is the Tribunal’s conclusion that any such alleged conduct was “cured”
by the Government within 45 days. If there was any doubt before 26 June 2014 about the
Government’s policy against new casinos, there was none afterwards. The Government’s
position was not shouted from the roof tops to the extent the Claimant now insists upon

but, in the Tribunal’s view, there was no contractual obligation undertaken by the

+ Relying on the Corfu Channel Case, Judgment of 9 April 1949, at 18 and Alpha Projektholding GmbH v.
Ukraine, (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16), Award of 8 November 2010) at 373.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 220 of 457

Government to have the Prime Minister make a high level denunciation of every potentially

damaging newspaper report or other misinformation sourced in the private sector.

13. The Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s argument that the violations of the Settlement
by the Government, to the extent they have been established (if at all), created such serious
prejudice to the Claimant as to render the violations incurable within the permitted 45 days.
The curative measures that were taken extinguished whatever claim for revival might

otherwise have arisen on the evidence before the Tribunal.

14. Accordingly, the Claimant’s application for a revival of the arbitration pursuant to
Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement must be dismissed. The disposition of costs will be
dealt with as hereinafter provided, and together with this decision on the merits, will be
incorporated in the Award to be issued under Article 52 of the Arbitration (Additional

Facility) Rules of ICSID.

IL. BRIEF HISTORY OF THE INVESTMENT

15. The Claimant has invested substantial monies since 2007 in three major projects in
Laos, the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino (“Savan Vegas”), the Paksong Vegas Hotel and
Casino (“Paksong Vegas”) and other enterprises (with local partners) that operated slot
machine clubs. The Claimant’s gambling assets are held through Sanum Investments Inc.,

a company incorporated in Macao.”

5 The Government makes the curious submission that there is no “operating company” or “subsidiary” which
is a party to the PDA. (Government Submission 3 April 2015 at para 119.) However, the Claimant’s
subsidiary Sanum is a party to the PDA. The Government’s submission seems to have overlooked the fact

6

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 221 of 457

16. The ICSID dispute related to the Respondent Government’s fiscal, regulatory and
administrative measures allegedly targeting the Claimant’s investment at the instigation of
the Claimant’s erstwhile but now estranged Laotian partners. These measures® according
to the Claimant deprived it of part or all of the value of its investment in the Laos gaming
and tourism industry. The Government, for its part, accused the Claimant of various acts

of criminality.”

17. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this application to explore in any detail the
particulars of the ICSID dispute. Suffice it to say that by the spring of 2014, the Claimant

and its U.S. principals wanted to halt the threatened Laotian criminal investigations and to

that Lao Holdings NC, not Sanum, is the only Claimant in the ICSID proceeding.

© The “oppressive” measures, the Claimant alleges, were instigated by powerful Laotian business and
political leaders in part for the benefit of Sanum’s estranged Laotian business partners, a Laotian company
called ST and its principals who are Laotian nationals. Eventually, the Government issued fresh tax claims
against Savan Vegas which the Claimant says were invalid but, being unpaid, led to the freezing of the Savan
Vegas bank accounts in Laos. The series of Government measures taken together, the Claimant contended
in the ICSID arbitration, amounted to de facto expropriation.

7 The Government contended that the Claimant and its related companies had for years been operating their
gambling operations using impenetrable accounting procedures, and in some respects acting illegally,
including through the corruption of Laotian Government officials. In 2013, the Government declared its
intention to initiate criminal investigations of the Claimant and its principals who are U.S. citizens. Counsel
for the Government made the submission at the 6 January 2014 hearing that:

 

[The Claimants] decided, for their own reasons, that they would put all their money
into Thailand; well, they had been putting their money in Thailand for the last five
years. And it is illegal, it is against the law in Laos for any Lao corporation to have
a bank account outside the country, and they had seven bank accounts outside the
country for the last five years. We can tell from some of the documents we received
from Ernst & Young that in one of those bank accounts in 2011, a year before the
“freezing order”, they put $11 million into a Thai bank account. That’s against the
law. (Transcript, 6 January 2014, pP. 19-20).

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 222 of 457

“maximize the Sale proceeds” of their gambling assets in Laos. Equally, the Government

wanted to see them gone.

Ill. THE DEED OF SETTLEMENT DATED 15 JUNE 2014 AND THE SIDE
LETTER OF 18 JUNE 2014

18. By Deed of Settlement dated 15 June 2014, which is to be read together with a Side
Letter dated 18 June 2014, the Claimant agreed with the Government to end the hearing of
the ICSID arbitration (and a parallel UNCITRAL arbitration involving Paksong Vegas that

was pending before the Permanent Court of Arbitration).

19. The Settlement is governed by New York law. It contemplated that the money
necessary to achieve a clean break between the Claimant and Laos would come from a
third party purchaser of the Claimant’s gambling assets. The Government itself did not

agree to pay any compensation. Its position was described by its counsel as follows:

We started negotiating on Thursday. We negotiated all day Friday. I imposed
the terms, here are the terms: “We pay them nothing; they dismiss their claims,
they sell their casino for what they can get, and they leave Lao. Those are the
terms.”

(Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 25)

I told you, I imposed the terms. I’ve been trying my best to make it possible
for them to work the deal. So, any time they asked me for anything that would
make it easier for them to sell, make it easier for them to do this or that, I would
put it in the Agreement. I bent over backwards.

(Transcript, 17 June 2014, p. 33)

20. Counsel for the Claimant explained the origins of the Settlement somewhat

differently:

The settlements arose--the possibility of the Settlement arose a couple of weeks
ago when Claimants received an offer to purchase their--the Savan Vegas
properties, and it became clear that that might be a means to resolve the disputes.
But, of course, Claimants can only sell the Savan Vegas and the other properties
they own with the cooperation of the Laos Government and with certain steps
taken by the Laos Government that make the properties salable.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 223 of 457

(Transcript, 19 June 2014, pp. 49-50) (emphasis added)

The “certain steps taken by the Laos Government” included, in the Claimant’s
view, negotiation of a new Flat Tax Agreement and preservation of the casino monopoly
acquired by Sanum under the Project Development Agreement on Savan Vegas
Entertainment Hotel and Casino in Savannakhet Province dated 10 August 20078 between
the Government and Sanum Investments and its private Laotian partners (hereinafter

referred to as the “2007 Sanum Agreement”).

21. Under the Settlement, the Claimant was entitled to attempt to complete a sale within
10 months from June 15, 2014, with an extension of time if necessary to accommodate
a closing date. During that time, the Claimant and its affiliates would continue to run
the businesses subject to the “monitoring and oversight” of the Government’s agent, RMC
Gaming Management LLC (“RMC”). At the end of 10 months, if no sale had materialized,
the Claimants and Laos would have the right “to appoint RMC or any other qualified operator”
to step in and manage the gambling assets “in place of the Claimants until the sale is complete”

(Article 12 of the Settlement).

22. Central to the Claimant’s argument is the interpretation of Article 6 of the Deed of
Settlement (as clarified by the Side Letter):

Article 6

Laos shall treat the Project Development Agreement (“PDA”) dated 10 August
2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino and each of the licenses and land
concessions issued in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, the Lao Bao Slot Club

® Exhibit C-004 at p. 10

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 224 of 457

and the Savannakhet Ferry Terminal Slot Club (collectively the “Gaming Assets”),
as being restated as of the Effective Date, with a term in each of fifty (50) years
from the Effective Date. ST owns 40% of the Lao Bao and Ferry Terminal Slot
Clubs. [emphasis added]
Much of the present dispute revolves around the disagreement of the parties about the

meaning and effect of the underlined words of Article 6.?

23. The Claimant says the effect of Article 6 is to make Sanum’s casino monopoly
enforceable not only by Sanum but also by its parent, the Claimant. The Government
acknowledges the existence of the casino monopoly but says that only Sanum (not the
Claimant) is entitled to enforce it. Moreover, the Government insists that any dispute under
the 2007 Sanum Agreement lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Singapore

International Arbitration Centre (SIAC).

24. The parties agree that the Settlement governs the negotiation of any new Flat Tax
Agreement (FTA), and that disputes in relation thereto are potentially within the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal under Article 32 of the Settlement. The Claimant argues that
the breach of the monopoly destroyed the Settlement, and with it a proper basis for the
Claimant to negotiate a new FTA and thereby contributed to its losses. The Government

responds that the Settlement is still in force and the continuing failure to reach a new FTA

° In its 3 April 2015 Submission, the Government states that in its ruling of 19 December 2014,

“the Tribunal never determines that the phrase “to treat as being restated”
is ambiguous, and therefore it is error to interpret unambiguous words by
reference to some supposed “purpose” not expressed in Article 13”.

In fact, the 19 December 2014 ruling stated unequivocally in para. 2 that “the Tribunal has also concluded,
for the reasons set out below, that given the ambiguous wording of Article 6 of the Deed of Settlement on
which the Claimant relies...” (emphasis added)

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 225 of 457

has been, and continues to be, exclusively attributable to the intransigence of the Claimant,
which has refused to name its nominee to the joint “Flat Tax Committee” contemplated

under Article 9 of the Settlement.

25. The Claimant also expected to profit from a land concession and development of
an airport and other amenities on 90 hectares of land at Thakhet under a memorandum of
understanding dated 20 October 2010 as contemplated under Article 22 of the Settlement.
When the Claimant declined to pay the required USD 500,000 fee in a timely way, the

Government declared an end to the Claimant’s potential participation in Thakhet.

@ The Alleged Breaches of the Settlement by the Respondent Government

26. A few days after the celebration in Singapore of the signing of the Deed of
Settlement and the Side Letter, the Claimant filed on 4 July 2014 an “Application for
Finding of Material Breach of Deed of Settlement and for Reinstatement of Arbitration”
(“the Material Breach Application”). The ground for relief was an allegation that the
Respondent Government had “approved and granted” gambling concession(s) to third
parties in the nearby “Savan City” project in breach of the Savan Vegas casino monopoly
rights, thereby ending (the Claimant said) any possibility of a sale that “will maximize Sale

proceeds to the claimant and Laos” as contemplated in Article 13 of the Settlement.'° It

‘0 The Government argues that Article 13 only applies to a sale by the Gaming Operator, RMC, if and when
RMC takes control of the Gaming Assets in the event Sanum fails to “complete a sale on time” (Government
Submission, 3 April 2015, at para. 109.). This is not correct. “Sale” is defined in Article 10 as “a Sale of the
gaming assets”. The context of Article 10 is a sale by the Claimant not the “Gaming Operator” RMC.
Accordingly the “Sale” referenced in Article 13 could be by either the Claimant or RMC, depending on the
circumstances, and in either case the purpose set out in Article 13 applies.

ll

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 226 of 457

also alleged, as stated, that the Government, not the Claimant, is responsible for the failure

to achieve a new FTA and the frustration of the Thakhet project.

(ii) The Sanum “Monopoly Rights”

27. The parties appear to agree that any Government permission to open a rival casino
would have a “material” impact on the income and future prospects of the Savan Vegas
Hotel and Casino. In its 3 April 2015 Submission, the Government concedes that “the
damages caused by a new casino could be large [and] when multiplied by 50 [i-e. the
number of years of the monopoly] could be astronomical” [para. 22]. Lower future
earnings as a result of increased competition would mean a lower current valuation and a

correspondingly reduced price for the Claimant’s gambling assets in the market place.

28. The “monopoly rights” are contained in article 9(24) of the 2007 Sanum Agreement,

which provides as follows:

The Company has been granted monopoly rights for its Casino business
operations only with the condition that the Government shall not approve and
grant any other parties or entities who put up their applications for the operation
of certain Casino business in the three (3) neighboring provinces close to the
Project development zone of the Company namely: Savannakhet, Khammaouane
and Bolikhamsay, throughout the concession period of 50 years.

However, should there have any applications submitted by any parties or entities,
all those shall be made through the consent and approval of both the
Government and the authorized investors who have management rights
(emphasis added)

The Government’s position is that it has given no “approval and grant” of a casino

licence in the Claimant’s exclusive territory. The Claimant responds that Article 9(24)

does not use the word “licence” and, in its view, may be breached without the actual grant

of a licence. The Claimant says:

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 227 of 457

“the provision of the PDA that underlies Claimant’s Application does not refer to
the grant of a gaming license, which in any event would be surprising at this early
stage of development of the project, rather, it is the “approval” of “casino
business,” whether formal or informal that constitutes a breach of Savan Vegas’s
monopoly rights and a material breach of the Settlement. (Claimant’s Submission,
27 March 2014, para. 7).

According to the Claimant, “informal” approval can be very informal, such as the
Government’s failure to shut down the non-conforming slot club(s) of Madam Kozy
(discussed below) or the presence of the Vice President of the National Assembly at a
signing ceremony on 26 June 2014!! where private developers announced a $10 billion

project for Savan City.

29. In the alternative, the Claimant argues that “even if the Tribunal declines to find
that Laos has approved a new casino at Savan City, the refusal of the Prime Minister or

political figure of equivalent authority to issue a single public statement denying approval

1! As Claimant’s counsel put it:

  

How does the government show approval? Well, it shows approval by sending a senior official like
the Vice President of the National Assembly to a signing ceremony which is highly-publicized
within Laos and outside of the country; and at which the Vice President of the Lao National
Assembly says that the goals of Savan City and the SEZ have been realized.

You'll recall the testimony, you will recall those are in the words in the press release and you will
recall Mr. Thongsay confirmed that is what he said. That is a statement of Lao government approval.
It is a public statement of Lao government approval, and it fits in with all the rest of the evidence
about what happened.

(Submissions, 14 April 2015, at p. 161)

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 228 of 457

of a casino over the past nine months itself constitutes a separate and independent material

breach of Section 6 of the Settlement”.!

30. In the further alternative, the Claimant accuses the Respondent Government of
attempting to mislead the Tribunal by submitting a “doctored” site map for Savan City and

“the Tribunal should need no more than that to determine that Laos is liable.”

(iii) The Flat Tax Arrangement
31. The Claimant’s previous 5-year FTA with the Government expired on 31

December, 2014.

32. The Settlement contemplated the negotiation of a new Flat Tax agreement within
45 days of 15 June 2014. The Claimant, having filed the present Application on 4 July
2014, declined to join in the agreed process to arrive at a new Flat Tax Agreement. It
argued that because of the Government’s alleged breach of the Savan Vegas monopoly
rights, the contractual arrangements made in the Settlement were, as a matter of law,
nullified. The Government’s breach of the monopoly rights therefore had the knock-on
effect of denying the Claimant the benefit of a new FTA as well as the opportunity offered

by the potential development of the Thakhet site.

33. In the result, Savan Vegas has paid no income tax on casino revenues or earnings

since 1 January 2015. It also withheld employment tax from January 1, 2015, until the

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 229 of 457

week prior to the Tribunal’s Singapore hearing on 13-14 April 2015, at which point Savan

Vegas paid employment tax said to be owing of approximately USD335,000.'*

IV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THE ALLEGED BREACH OF
THE SAVAN VEGAS MONOPOLY RIGHTS

34. The Claimant contends that the Government has approved and granted permission
to build and operate a rival casino in the “Savan City” project adjacent to the Savan Vegas

Hotel and Casino in Savannakhet Province.

35. In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence does not justify any such conclusion.

@ The “Savan City Project”

36. The Government, in 2003, established a Special Economic Zone (SEZ) adjacent to
what became the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino property. The SEZ is administered by the

Savan SENO Special Economic Authority, (“the SEZ Authority”), a Government entity.

37. Little if any development of this SEZ has occurred since 2003.

38. In 2007, the SEZ Authority entered into an agreement for the development of a
portion of the SEZ called Site A with a private developer, the Thai Airports Ground

Services Co. Ltd. [*TAGS”], under which a new operating company (eventually called

“Savan City”) would be formed.'> For ease of reference, the 2007 Agreement will be

herein referred to as “the 2007 Savan City PDA”.

39. Savan City, as it is now called, is owned 70% by private interests, who were
responsible for raising the funds and developing the Project, and owned 30%, directly or

indirectly, by the Government.

40. The 2007 Savan City PDA attached a Master Plan for development. Over the

ensuing years, TAGS failed to produce a viable development for Site A.

Al. Between 2008 and 2012, the Claimant, through Sanum attempted to promote a
development on site A.'° In 2013 Sanum submitted a proposal of about 200 pages for

development of Site A to the Deputy Prime Minister. This was not accepted.

42. In 2014, Savan City put together a development proposal for Site A in conjunction

with a Malaysian private developer, Asean Union Inc.

43. At a press conference in Vientiane, the capital of Laos, on 26 June 2014, Savan
City and Asean Union announced the new $10 billion project. The project was based on
three development agreements for a portion of Site A that included an agreement for a

financial centre!’ that would offer “off-shore” banking services (herein referred to as the

'S The Agreement is dated 13 June 2007 and made between the Savan SENO Special Economic Zone

“Asean Bank Agreement”, a project that would require changes in Laotian banking law),
an agreement for a substantial resort'® (herein referred to as the “Entertainment
Complex” agreement), and an Agreement to establish “Savan Gateway”, a development
that included a shopping centre, Tourist Information Centre, duty free shopping, a petrol

station and other facilities.!°

44. The Master Plan attached to the Asean Bank Agreement” and the Entertainment
Complex Agreement?! designated part of the site as the location of a casino. The casino

designation in the Master Plan is heavily relied upon by the Claimant to prove its case.

45. At the very public “signing ceremony” in Vientiane, the promoters announced a
new “US $10 billion” project, to be called Asean Paradize Savan City. As stated, the Vice
President of the National Assembly attended the signing ceremony and welcomed the
potential $10 billion investment. The private promoters hoped to develop a new casino
close to the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, but there is no evidence the Vice President was
aware of the casino objective. The promoters’ press release on that day did not make

explicit reference to a casino:

“The Integrated Entertainment resort, will become a major
tourism attraction for Laos with theme parks, recreation,

hospitality and food, and our objective is to rival some of Asia’s
top entertainment regions, as we combine Laotian hospitality with

722

modern entertainment concepts and attractions”.

46. The Claimant learned about this announcement in a report published in The Nation,

a Thai newspaper, on 27 June 2014, which did refer to a casino, as follows:

Malaysian investor ASEAN Union Group has launched its second venture
overseas — the Asean Paradize Savan City — in Laos with a total investment of
USD$10 billion (B13T20 billion) comprising of offshore financial center,
entertainment, casino and communities for foreigners. (emphasis added)

47. The story was taken up by other media including the Asian Gambling Brief which

reported on June 27, 2014 that:

Work is scheduled to start in July this year on a $10 billion project in Laos
including an offshore financial centre, a casino and entertainment complex and
community for foreigners, according to The Nation Newspaper. (emphasis added)

 

48. According to the Claimant, it was the published references to the construction of a
rival casino adjacent to the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino complex that led the Claimant
to trade mutually accusatory correspondence with the Government and, eventually, to file

its Material Breach Application on 4 July 2014.

49. The Claimant has identified and filed numerous blogs and websites referring to a
casino project on Site A but none of these announcements are sourced with the

Government. However, the Claimant says that if the casino publicity was untrue, the Prime

2 Exhibit C-796, 26 June 2014

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 233 of 457

Minister himself should have publically said so. Instead, the Prime Minister stayed silent,
and the only published denial at the ministerial level was contained in a report in BC] ASIA

on 26 August 2014.?> This was too little and too late, the Claimant says.

50. In addition, the Claimant relies on the evidence of Ms. Lisa McWilliams, a
businesswoman who lives in Saipan who was sent by the Claimant to visit the premises of
Asean Paradize (the marketing arm of Asean Union) on August 26, 2014, in Kuala Lumpur.
She met with Aubry O’Hara, a senior employee. Ms. McWilliams indicated to him that
she had clients who might be interested in making a direct investment in Site A. Mr.
O’Hara, without prompting, suggested an investment in a casino. Ms. McWilliams held a

similar meeting with Mr. Chew of Asean Union. Her evidence was that:

“[Mr. O’ Hara of Asean Paradize] explained that Savan City would have an Asean
Paradize Bank, shopping malls, condos, off-shore banking, an entertainment
centre, hotels and a casino”. (para. 14) (emphasis added)

“[Mr. Chew of Asean Union] said a casino ultimately would be licensed by the
Lao Government. . . and he was very confident that it would be built.” (para. 23)
(emphasis added)

23 See BCI ASIA 26 August 2014: “Govt says casino not part of Savan City project.”

The government has confirmed that there has been no agreement reached for a casino to operate
under the Savan City project, in the Savan-Seno Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) in Savannakhet
province.

The Secretariat Office of the Lao National Committee for Special Economic Zones (S-NCSEZ)
issued an official letter recently, denying a June 27 report by Thai media (The Nation) that a casino
will be incorporated in the development.

 

Vice Governor of Savan-Seno Special Economic Zone Authority Mr. Thongsay Sayavongkharmdy
told Vientiene Times yesterday that he wondered howt he media (the Nation) got information about
this project, saying that their information about the casino is inacurate.

19

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 234 of 457

There is no reason to doubt the witness statement of Ms. McWilliams. However,
it simply confirms that ASEAN Union and its affiliates were doing whatever they could to
promote development of the site. If the prize of a casino attracted investment so much the
better. Ms. McWilliams’ evidence does not establish any grant and approval of permission

for a rival casino that can be attributed to the Government.

S51. Similarly, the Claimant relies on the evidence of Mr. Eugene McCain, a developer
based in Phukhet, Thailand, who was sent by the Claimant to visit the premises of Asian
Engineering Consultants (“AEC”) in Bangkok on February 16, 2015. He was told about
an AEC project in Savannakhet and was shown a proposed Master Plan of Savan City that

included a casino. His evidence was that:

“(The AEC management team] explained that there would actually be two casino

gaming facilities at Savan City.” (para. 11)

Again, there is no reason to doubt the accuracy of Mr. McCain’s recollection of his
conversation with senior officials at AEC.24 However, promotional efforts by AEC, an
entrepreneurial engineering and planning firm in Bangkok, does not establish any approval

and grant of permission by the Government of Laos.

795).

52. Mr. John Baldwin, the principal of the Claimant, acknowledged in cross-

examination that he had no personal knowledge of any such Government approval.”°

53. Moreover, as stated earlier, Article 9(24) of the 2007 Savan Vegas PDA
contemplates that applications could be submitted “by any parties or entities” for a new
casino licence in the Claimant’s monopoly area, but approval thereof would require the
“consent and approval” of both the Government and the “authorized investors who have
management rights” [i.e. Sanum itself, which is a subsidiary of the Claimant]. To the extent
that Asean Union was attempting to round up funding for a casino project on Site A prior
to making such a submission to the Government, there was no breach of the 2007 Savan
Vegas PDA, to which in any event, of course, Asean Union was not a party. In theory, at
least, Sanum might have given its consent, as indeed in 2013 Sanum discussed a joint
arrangement with Madam Kozy’s slot machine clubs within Sanum’s exclusive territory,

as described below.

(ii) The Doctored Evidence

54. The Claimant alleges that the Government attempted to mislead the Tribunal with
a “doctored” version of the Site A plan attached to the 2014 Asean Bank Agreement and
the 20/4 Entertainment Complex Agreement. The new Plan, produced shortly before the

Singapore hearing, substituted the designation “CJHQ” for the word “casino” on a cross-

25 Evidence of John Baldwin, Transcript 14A, p. 34, IL 3-6.

21

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 236 of 457

hatched portion of the Site Plan.”° The “doctored evidence” was so serious a matter, the

Claimant says, as to justify rescinding the Settlement.

55. In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence does not warrant or justify this allegation. The
Site plans attached to two of the three Asean Union Agreements do indicate a site for a
casino. Mr. Chanchai in paragraph 11 of his 18 December 2014 statement acknowledged

this fact.2” The Claimant’s position was shown to be correct.

56. When Mr. Chanchai was subsequently asked by counsel for the Respondent
Government for a clearer copy of the original site plan, Mr. Chanchai says he decided that
the designation of a casino should be removed from the map because it was misleading,

and he did so. He testified (as translated) in cross-examination as follows:

I changed this map because when there are problems, Mr. Thongsay asked me to
submit the whole document for him to double-check whether I have any agreement
with Asean Union. When Mr. Thongsay consider and then he complained that the
casino, why it is under the plan, casino is the activity that the Government is not
allow, so please do not deviate or to mislead people there is casino, so I have to
eradicate it so that it is correct. We have this new plan.”

57. The Claimant objects that the “new plan” was not identified as a “new plan” when

transmitted to its counsel but erroneously passed off as a legible copy of the original plan.

26 Transcript, 13 April at p. 32

27 Chanchai witness statement dated 18 December 2014, para. 11:
When we were drafting the agreement at the last minute, I
placed a map that showed a hotel with a casino labelled on the
map in the agreement because it was an old one in my files.

°8 Transcript, 13 April, p. 188, Il. 2-11.

22

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 237 of 457

Be that as it may, Mr. Chanchai’s admission with respect to the word “casino” was already
in the record, and whatever miscommunication occurred when the map was provided to

the Claimant in regrettable but of no great probative value.

58. The Claimant also contends, based on Mr. John Baldwin’s evidence, that Savan
City would not have announced the $10 billion project unless the casino had been

approved.

59. Whatever may be Mr. Baldwin’s experience, it is clear that Savan City and Asean
Union did not comply with such a prudent “practice”. They were prepared to make
announcements before the grant of necessary licenses and approvals. This is confirmed by
the fact that on 26 June 2014, the Asean Union itself announced not only a casino but the
establishment of a significant “offshore” banking centre on Site A. The banking centre
could not happen without a change in the laws of Laos governing banking. No such change

had been made. Mr. Hassan of Asean Union testified:

Q. You have said in your witness statements that you wish to
develop a financial centre?
A. Yes.

Q. Inside there? [i.e. Site A]
A. That is exactly what I want to do. That is my expertise.

Q. You’ve said that you’ve approached the Government of
Laos to have a financial regulatory laws passed by the national
assembly?

A. Yes, that is right. I submitted six inches of -- few
thousand pages of laws which I expected them to go through and
pass for an offshore financial centre to be created.

Q. If the national legislature, national assembly of Laos, does
not pass those laws, does not change the banking regulatory
environment, will you invest any money in Site A?

A. No point in investing there then.

23

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 238 of 457

Q. The answer is no?
A. No.
(Transcript 13 April, p. 200, 1 14 to p. 201, 1. 8) (emphasis added)

In other words, no changes had been made to the banking laws, yet the promoters
announced the development of an “offshore” banking facility with fanfare on 26 June 2014

as part of a $10 billion investment for which approval had not been secured.

60. The Tribunal is of the view that no inference of Government prior “grant and
approval” of permission for a casino can be drawn from the promoters’ publicity at the 26

June “signing ceremony”.

(iii) The “Integrated Entertainment Complex”

61. The Claimant argues that the expression “integrated entertainment complex”,
which appear in various of the promoters’ documents, is well understood “in industry
parlance” as a euphemism for “a complex built around a casino”.2? The 2014
“Entertainment Resort” Agreement uses the expression “Integrated Entertainment
Complex” in its preamble, as does more recent promotional material for “Savan Eco-City”.
Therefore, the Claimant says, a casino is still in the plan for Site A, albeit camouflaged by

an euphemism.

29 Claimant’s Submission,, 7 March 2015, at para. 2

24

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 239 of 457

62. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant puts more weight on this argument than is

plausible in light of all the other evidence.

63. Whatever may be the understanding of the phrase “integrated entertainment
complex” in some circles, this meaning was not acknowledged by the aspiring promoters
of Savan City, neither of whom had any particular experience in the gambling industry.
The Government witness Mr. Thongsay denied any such connotation in “our country”. He

testified as follows:

Q. Did you ever try to understand what the words “integrated
entertainment resort” or “integrated entertainment complex”
meant in the world of tourism and gaming?

A. The meaning of “resort” or “comprehensive” - or
comprehensive, or “integrated entertainment”, I do not understand
how they interpret it in other regions, but for our country, it mean
that it is related to promotion, tourism promotion, there are play
areas for children, there are singing contests, TV programs so that
people will have enjoyable activities, because our culture is
related to the culture promoting arts, but_not about casino.
(emphasis added)

(Transcript, 13 April, p. 156)

In any event, unless the Claimant could tie its understanding of the euphemism to
the Government, and thereby attempt to link the Government to an implicit “grant and
approval” of permission for a casino (which the Claimant is unable to do), this

terminological argument is of insignificant probative value.

(iv) | Conclusion with Respect to the Activities of the Promoters of Savan City

64. The Tribunal is satisfied that the private developers involved in Savan City
promoted the idea of a casino on Site A. It seems probable that at the time of the “signing

ceremony” on 26 June 2014, both Mr. Chanchai and Mr. Hassan optimistically thought the

25

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 240 of 457

Government might be persuaded to licence a new casino (however much they may have
denied it when challenged by Madam Bouatha Khatthinda, a senior Government official

on 2 July 2014). Madam Bouatha testified as follows:

Q. Just so I’m clear, at the meeting, did they tell you that they
never planned to build a casino in Site A?

A. Yes. I asked them time and time again not to tell a lie
because this is something that you can do it very lightly, and then
they answer that, “we never have any intention to develop the
casino in Site A”, because the largest investor - they’re Muslim -
so they consider casino violating their belief, so representative
Asean Union said so.

Q. So the representative of Asean Union said it never had any
intention to operate a casino in Site A; is that correct?
A. Yes.*°

It seems the developers may not have been candid with Madam Bouatha. But she,
according to her testimony (which the Tribunal accepts), was very candid and categorical

with them. There would be no casino on Site A.

65. In any event, the intended target of the Claimant’s submissions is not the private
promoters but to implicate the Government. There is no evidence that Mr. Chanchai or
other private developer approached the Savan City Board, or the SEZ Authority or any
other Government entity even to inquire about the potential availability of permission for
a casino. There is no evidence that either Mr. Chanchai or Mr. Hassan was even aware
before June 26, 2014 of the Government prohibition or the Claimant’s monopoly

entitlement.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 241 of 457

Vv. ACTIVITIES OF SAVAN CITY AND ITS PROMOTERS CANNOT IN THE
CIRCUMSTANCES BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GOVERNMENT

66. As stated, the Government, through its SEZ Authority, has a 30% minority interest

in Savan City and three members of the seven members Board of Directors.

67. The evidence is clear that Savan City is a commercial corporation. It is not the
Government. The 2007 Savan City PDA lays the foundation for a public/private
partnership. It bears many of the hallmarks of a shareholders’ agreement and establishes a
governance structure that considerably limits the authority of Mr. Chanchai and his

“majority” shareholders.

68. The 70% majority shareholder, the Asean Union Inc., appoints the Vice Chairman
of the Board who is also the chief operating officer (Mr. Chanchai) and three additional
members, who together constitute a majority of the Board. The Vice Chairman of Savan
City is required to run its day to day operations “in accordance with policies and strategies
approved by the Board of Directors”, but only the Board itself is authorized to make “major

decisions”. In particular, the 2007 Savan City PDA provided that:

In any Board of Directors meetings, the representatives from “both parties” shall
attend and decisions on any major issues shall be made based on the consensus
principle:

The Board had the right and duty to consider and approve investment operational
plans of the Company.

27

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 242 of 457

69. The uncontradicted evidence of Mr. Thongsay Sayavongkhandy, a Government-
appointed Director of Savan City, was that in fact that the Board had not met “for a number

of years” because implementation of the Site A project was not “progressing”.*!

@ Mere Ownership of a 30% Minority Interest is not “Control”

70. It is elementary that 30% of the voting shares of a corporation, and a minority of
seats on the Board of Directors, does not confer “control”. Of course, the majority
shareholders would be conscious in their decision making of the existence of such a
sizeable 30% minority, especially when the minority shareholder is the Government of

Laos.

71. Moreover, the Claimant points out, a fourth Board member, while not a
Government employee, is “intimately connected to the Lao Government and a close

relative of a number of senior and powerful Lao officials”.*?

72. The evidence of Madam Bouatha, head of the SEZ Secretariat, was that the
Government representatives played a passive role in public/private partnerships in SEZs

because of their inexperience:

“We never take control, both because of our limited shareholdings and because we
depend on the expertise and experience of our investing partners to run their
business. We want our officials who serve on boards to learn the best practices so

when the concession terminates and reverts to the Government, we will have been
training our officials.”*
723. Similarly the Government official most intimately involved in the affairs of Savan

City, Mr. Thongsay testified (in translation) in the course of cross-examination as follows:

The press release broadcasted by Asean Union, they did not present to the board of
director and they do not present it to our SEZ management, so it is beyond our
jurisdiction and it not official document for government to be recognised on.
(Transcript, April 13, 2015, p. 139, Il. 2-7)

* * *

In fact, I have not contacted with Asean Union, because Asean Union, they are not

the partner of the government. (Transcript, April 13, 2015, p. 137, I. 5-12)
74. Mr. Thongsay’s attitude (and the Tribunal has no reason to doubt his description of
the process) was simply that if the “private” partners brought forward a project, it would

be processed in accordance with Government requirements.

75. It is to be noted that on 28 June 2013, a year before the events in question here, a
Directive was issued to all SEZs confirming that they had no authority to licence new

casinos.

There must not be any authorization for establishment of casino or gambling
related activities in the Special Economic Zones except for the agreements that
have already been signed with the Government.**

29

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 244 of 457

The Claimant points out that this Directive did not purport to preclude the Prime
Minister’s office from granting permission. On the other hand, the bureaucratic road to the
Prime Minister’s office lies through Madam Bouatha, who testified that no application for
a casino was made by or on behalf of the developers of Site A. There is no evidence of
anyone following a different path to the Prime Minister’s office and the Tribunal cannot
proceed on the basis of Mr. Baldwin’s unsupported speculation and innuendo that some
such “unofficial” approach may have been made.

(ii) No Board of Directors Meeting of Savan City Was Called to Authorize the

Signing of the 2014 Agreements
76. The evidence is that the Savan City Board of Directors never met to consider any
of the three 2014 development agreements. The testimony (in translation) of Mr. Thongsay

was as follows:

“... signing of such contract have not communicated and channelled through the
board of director of the company, and it is not approved by the Government. So it

235

makes it just only signing among the private sector’

77. The Claimant suggests that while the Government was formally in a minority
position in terms of shares and board representation, in reality its influence as Government
would prevail at the Board level on any “major issue”. This may be so, but the evidence

is clear and uncontradicted that no Board of Directors meeting took place.

88 Transcript, 13 April 2015, p. 133, 114-8

30

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 245 of 457

78. Counsel for the Claimant conceded that it is obvious that Board approval was
required to authorize the three Asean Union agreements.*® The Tribunal agrees. The
requirement in the 2007 Savan City PDA was that a meeting of the Board is to be called
“on any major issues” and that the representatives from both parties “shall attend” and
decisions “shall be made on the consensus principle”. Moreover, as stated, the Board had
the right and duty to consider and approve investment plans of the Company. On the

evidence, then, corporate approval was required and no corporate approval was given.

79. The Claimant’s argument was that either a meeting of the Savan City Board was in
fact held as required and approval was in fact given to the Asean Union Agreements, and
therefore that the Government witnesses were lying, or that in Laos corporations operate

freely outside the framework of their governing laws. The more plausible conclusion,

*° Counsel for the Claimant submitted:

It’s in this context also that you have to consider the question of whether or not there was board
approval. You have heard Lao’s witnesses repeat many times that there was not board approval,
that there hadn’t been a meeting in years and therefore all these government representatives on the
board had never seen the agreements and did not know what the project was all about. That is why
they have to deny that there was any board approval.

Well, we also saw and you saw yesterday, Mr. Thongsay confirmed and Mr. Khanpheth confirmed
that the board of directors has to approve any major agreements. You saw that in the 2007 agreement
in Article 6, you also saw in Article 10 that any hiring of a contractor had to be informed and
bringing in of a new partner had to be approved.

It is impossible to believe that the three agreements that bound Savan City to this project, and that
realized the goals of Savan City - - these were binding agreements, these were not MOUs - - that
those binding agreements are not operative agreements that had to be approved by the board of
directors. The language of Article 6 in that 2007 agreement, which both sides agree is the operative
document, made that clear.

(Submissions, 14 April 2015, p. 162, 17 to p. 163, 1. 6)

31

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 246 of 457

however, is that no meeting of Directors was held, no approval was given, and the Asean
Union Agreements were unauthorized by the Savan City corporation.
(iii) There is no Evidence that Officials in the Prime Minister’s Office Received
Any Application for the Approval and Grant of Permission for a Rival Casino
80. The evidence of Madam Bouatha was that the approval for any new casinos licences
would have to be decided at “a meeting” of the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister.
Such applications would be processed through her office as well as the Ministry of
Planning and Investment.*” She testified that no such applications were ever made with

respect to Savan City.** The Tribunal has no reason to disbelieve her testimony.

 

VI. TERNATIONAL LAW PRINCIPLES OF STATE ATTRIBUTION DO
NOT IMPOSE LIABILITY ON THE GOVERNMENT
81. It is clear that a minority shareholding in a corporation is not sufficient in

international law (as well as domestic law), of itself, to attribute the acts of a corporation
to its shareholders. The result is no different where the minority shareholder is a
Government. Professor (now Judge) James Crawford’s Commentary on Article 8 of The

International Law Commission text so states:°?

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 247 of 457

In discussing this issue it is necessary to recall that international law acknowledges
the general separateness of corporate entities at the national level, except in those
cases where the “corporate veil” is a mere device or a vehicle for fraud or evasion.

There is no evidence that Savan City was engaged in “fraud or evasion”.

82. Of course, corporate acts may be attributed to the Government if the Government
directs and controls the corporation’s activities,*° particularly if such control is exercised
in relation to the subject matter of the dispute,*! Article 8 stands in part for the proposition

that:

where there was evidence ... that the State was using its ownership interest in or
control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve a particular result, the
conduct in question has been attributed to the State.

However, there is no evidence of such direction or control in this case. On the contrary,
both Madam Bouatha of the SEZ Secretariat, and Mr. Chanchai representing the private
developers of Savan City, testified to the contrary, and both were present and cross-

examined on this point at the Singapore hearing.
83. Madam Bouatha testified in her written witness statement:

“T can state with personal knowledge that the Government has not had any input
much less control over the Savan City project for many years. Mr. Chanchai was
not able to raise any money and there were no decisions to make. There was
silence from him. The Government was not involved in any way in the

negotiations or plans Mr. Chanchai made with Asean Union that were announced
in 2014.°?

84. Mr. Chanchai made an equivalent written statement:
“No Government official has had any involvement in design or engineering
proposals I developed or SV Leasing developed over the past eight years to help
me try to raise money to develop Site A. No Government official has had any
involvement in developing websites for the company. No design plans I or others

developed and the websites were never submitted to the Board or any Government
agency or department for information or approval”.**

85. Counsel for the Claimant in cross-examination expressed scepticism to both
witnesses about the source of the drafting of their witness statements but there was no onus
on the Government to establish that approval was not given. The onus was on the Claimant
to establish on a balance of probabilities that approval was given. In any event the denials

of Madam Bouatha and Mr. Chanchai were not shaken in cross-examination.

VII. THE CLAIMANT’S THEORY OF A “TACIT” APPROVAL AND GRANT

86. Counsel for the Claimant advanced an alternate theory that even if there was no
“approval and grant” of permission to a rival casino, the political culture in Laos is such
that powerful people and those under their protection may operate businesses under tacit
or “unofficial” permission. Thus, according to the Claimant, an inference of permission

should be drawn against the Government based on the informality of local practice. The

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 249 of 457

Claimant’s evolving Submission on this aspect of the “attribution” issue is made in its 8
April 2015 Submission as follows:

Claimant has not alleged, and does not allege, that Savan City is a state entity

whose action “is in law an action by the Government.” Claimant’s case does not

hinge on proving that the Government itself is responsible for Savan City’s actions,

including the content of its website. The point is rather that it is not credible to

suggest that a company in which the Lao Government holds a significant

shareholding, and enjoys a significant corporate governance presence, could have

publicized that it would build a casino to future investors, and entered into a joint

venture agreement to build a casino, without the Government at the very least

knowing and approving of these facts. [para. 50] (emphasis added]
87. This position was supported by the evidence of the Claimant’s principal, Mr. John
Baldwin, as follows:

While Laos’s assertions that it has not granted a competing license might literally

be true, my years of experience tell me that Laos must have at least tacitly approved

a competing casino project in Savan City. As I stated previously, no developer

begins to market a development to investors without at least some assurance that

it has permission to build what it is marketing.“

The “prudent promoter” argument has already been dealt with. As to “tacit
approval”, the Claimant relied heavily on the existence of unlicensed slot club(s) owned
by a Laotian citizen, Madam Kozy. In her case, the Claimant argues, Government approval

consisted of no more than a wink and a nod, or simply looking the other way and ignoring

her illegal use.

88. The Tribunal does not agree that based on Madam Kozy’s situation the words

“approve and grant” in Article 9(24) of the 2007 Sanum PDA can be interpreted so loosely.

+4 Witness Statement of John Baldwin, 27 March 2015 at para. 4

35

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 250 of 457

89. It seems that Madam Kozy had a relatively modest slot club operating before the
signing of the Savan Vegas PDA in August 2007. The Claimant suggests that Madam
Kozy recently opened another club near the Friendship Bridge. The evidence on this point
is unclear.*° The Claimant also alleges that the Government drew the boundaries of the
SEZ around Madam Kozy’s operations so that the Government could continue to say
(disingenuously) that there were no casinos permitted in the SEZs. Madam Kozy and her

business partner were well connected socially and politically.

90. The Tribunal is prepared to assume that if Madam Kozy had formal licences for her
slot club(s), the Government would have produced them (as requested) in this arbitration.

The Tribunal concludes that no such formal licence(s) exist.

91. Madam Kozy’s operation may or may not be evidence of discrimination or
differential treatment. It seems the Government was prepared to shape the SEZ boundary
to leave her gambling operations outside.*7 However, the fact that the Government has not
shut down the slot club operations of Madam Kozy, which do not include a full service
casino, is not of sufficient weight to persuade the Tribunal that the words “approve and
grant” in Article 9(24) of the 2007 Savan Vegas Agreement can be stretched out of shape
because of alleged nods, winks and the single established instance of a non-compliant slot

club operator (Madam Kozy). The fact that the Government may have turned a blind eye

to a relatively small slot machine operation or two does not mean that there is no formal
casino approval process in place or that Article 9(24) refers to something other than a
formal “approve and grant” process. Mr. Baldwin, the principal of the Claimant, and the
source of the “tacit” approval theory, acknowledged that indeed a formal licencing system
was in place.

Q. Who in Laos has the authority to approve a casino

licence?

A. Officially or unofficially?

Q. You mean there’s an unofficial chain of command in the
government of Laos?

A. You have a 1 1-member politburo who are always trading
favours between each other. If any one of them wants a casino
licence and is willing to trade with the others for other things they
want, a casino licence will appear. The president of the country
who is also — would be able to grant a licence if he wished. The
head of the party, if he wished to, I believe would be able to.

Q. Who had the official authority in the government of Laos
to grant a casino licence?

A. It’s been — I have been told, although I don’t have proof
of this, that the prime minister must grant casino licences.

Q. That is the official position of the government? The prime
minister is the only authority in the country who can grant a casino
licence?

A. Yes. That is what I have been told.

92. It seems therefore that the ability of powerful political interests to “get their
way” is not inconsistent with the requirement of formal approval and grant of a casino
license. The argument that certain people may be able to obtain such a license despite
the general prohibition does not mean the need for such a license would be dispensed

with. It seems obvious a major investor, particularly a foreign investor, would want a

formal written licence before making a major investment in Laotian gambling

facilities, as did Sanum itself in 2007.

93. It should be noted that the Government’s tolerance of Madam Kozy’s slot
club(s) is not put forward as an independent ground of complaint in the Claimant’s
Material Breach Application.

VIII. THE GOVERNMENT IS ENTITLED TO RELY ON THE 45 DAY “CURE”
PERIOD PROVIDED IN ARTICLE 32

94. Even if it were established that the Government had approved and granted
permission for a casino to operate in Site A with a wink or a nod on or before receipt of the
Claimant’s Notice of Breach on 27 June 2014, the Government had a contractual right to
cure the breach within 45-days of receipt of such Notice and if it did so, there can be no

revival of the ICSID arbitration.

95. Madam Bouatha testified that when she learned of the Claimant’s complaint that
permission had been granted for a Site A casino, she summonsed Mr. Thongsay,
Mr. Chanchai and a representative of the ASEAN Union, Mr. Ellingham to a meeting on 2
July 2014, and made it clear that “only the Prime Minister” had the authority to approve.**

She says that she was assured that there would be no casino in the Site A development.

96. Madam Bouatha instructed Savan City and Asean Union to contact The Nation and

at least one other publication to correct the published misinformation about the plan for a

casino. This was done although it appears the demands made no specific reference to the

casino.

97. Mr. Khanpheth Viraphondet, a senior legal advisor to the Government was
dispatched to Savannakhet by the Prime Minister’s office” to investigate. He met with
representatives of Savan City and local officials on 4 August and 5 August 2014.
Mr. Khanpheth testified that his investigation confirmed that the Savan City Board had not
met and that no approval was granted or purportedly granted by the local SEZ Authority
or any other Government entity or official. His evidence was not weakened on cross-

examination.

98. The Tribunal is satisfied that the Government did respond promptly to the 26 June
2014 misreporting in the media about a rival casino and made it clear to the private
developers in Savan City that no permission for a casino had been or would be approved

or granted.

99. The Claimant contends that the post 26 June 2014 conduct of the Government was
not sufficient to cure the damage done. The Government’s action amounted to shutting the
barn door after the horse had left the stable. Prospective purchasers would already have
lost confidence in the promises of the Government, and even more effective remedial

action would have been futile. The breach, the Claimant says, was incurable.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 254 of 457

100. The Tribunal does not accept the Claimant’s argument that a misleading article in
a Thai newspaper and subsequent and related postings inflicted such destruction on the
value or marketability of Savan Vegas as to make the so-called breach incurable.
Newspapers are known to most people to make mistakes. Blogs sometimes privilege speed
over accuracy. The Government moved promptly to clarify its prohibition to the Savan
City promoters. In any event, the evidence of Greg Bousquette, a merchant banker well
versed in the gambling industry,*° who was contacted by Mr. Baldwin following the
Settlement, affirmed that “it is key that Buyers have comfort that they will get a monopoly
signed off on at the highest levels of the Lao government.”*! (emphasis added) Serious

buyers would not be put off by cyber-gossip.

101. The Tribunal accepts the evidence of the Government’s expert, Mr. Govinda Singh,

a principal at BDO. In Mr. Singh’s opinion:

... no investor would only consider a newspaper article. If an announcement is

made which is not consistent with the market’s understanding of the agreements

in place, an investor would seek to understand the issues by undertaking further

investigations.

Such “further investigations” would have demonstrated that permission had not
been “approved and granted” for a rival casino, and that the Government had procedures

in place to prevent permission for a casino without authority from a “meeting” of the Prime

Minister and Deputy Prime Minister, which on the evidence was not initiated. Mr. Singh

was available in Singapore to be cross-examined but the Claimant elected not to cross-

examine him.

102. In order to find the Government liable for what the Claimant regards as an in-
sufficiently public Government denunciation of reports and blogs about the “rival casino”,
the Claimant must identify some source of a legal obligation on the part of the Government
to do so. In the Tribunal’s view, the Government did not, as a term of the Settlement,
assume any undertaking, directly or indirectly, to respond publicly to misleading
statements about Savan City in the media, blogs or websites. The Settlement obligation to
complete the sale “on a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds” (Article 13) does not go
so far, nor is such a positive obligation imported into the Settlement by the duty of good
faith performance under New York law.°* Assuming for the sake of argument the
interpretation of the Settlement most favourable to the Claimant, its case put at its highest
is that the Government was obligated to respect Sanum’s monopoly. On the evidence, the

Government did so.

*? Counsel for the Claimant put this aspect of his argument as follows:
Q. Where do you ground that obligation to speak up?

Mr. Rivkin: it’s grounded in the obligation of good faith and fair dealing which is in every New
York law contract. It is also grounded in the specific provision of the deed that says they are going
to work with us to maximize the sale proceeds, and it’s grounded in the way all of the provisions of
the deed of settlement work together, including this provision, and the clear purpose of Article 6
and the restating of the monopoly provision was what I have described to you earlier, is letting the
market know that you can trust Lao with respect to this; you can have a higher degree of trust anyway
with respect to that, and so it’s based on that..

(Submission 14 April 2015, p. 166, 1. 14 to p. 167, 1. 3)

4l

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 256 of 457

103. To the extent such misleading statements in the media and cyberspace might chill
potential purchasers, such purchasers would, as Mr. Singh testified, have looked into the
monopoly issue and verified the facts with senior Government officials. Upon inquiry they
would have been told what Mr. Chanchai and Mr. Ellington were told. No rival casino had

or would be approved.

104. | The Tribunal’s conclusions do not ignore Mr. Baldwin’s evidence about the risk of
powerful people in Laos getting their way at some future date and obtaining permission for
rival gambling facilities (albeit such conduct could expose the Government to a claim for
substantial damages by Sanum under s. 9 (24) of the 20/4 Sanum Agreement). However,
the Tribunal is not tasked with speculation about what might happen in the future. In the
Tribunal’s view, the Government’s default, if there was any default in June 2014 or
otherwise as alleged by the Claimant, was cured within the 45 days permitted by the

Settlement.

IX. THE PROPER INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE DEED OF
SETTLEMENT

105. In its interim ruling of 19 December 2014, the Tribunal identified two potential
interpretations of Article 6, one of which favoured the Claimant and the other, had it been

adopted, favoured the Government.

106. In view of the Tribunal’s conclusions on the facts, it is not necessary to revisit the

issue of contract interpretation, which is no longer of practical significance.

42

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 257 of 457

X. DISPOSITION OF THE APPLICATION FOR PROVISIONAL
MEASURES

107. The Tribunal deferred to the April 13/14, 2015 Singapore hearing the Claimant’s
Application for a Provisional Measures Order (PMO) to preserve the status quo against
potential Government action between the date of the April hearing and the issuance of a

final award.

108. By order dated 14 April 2015, having heard the evidence, the Tribunal dismissed

the PMO Application for reasons to follow. The reasons are as follows.

109. As the Tribunal noted in its Provisional Measures Order of 17 September 2013, a
PMO is only available when the following conditions are met (1) prima facie jurisdiction;
(2) prima facie establishment of the right to the relief sought; (3) urgency; (4) imminent
danger of serious prejudice (necessity); and (5) proportionality.°? Each of these

components except for (2) was met in this instance.

110. With respect to condition (2) however, the Tribunal was satisfied at the conclusion
of the evidence on 14 April, after deliberation, that the Claimant had not established even

a prima facie right to the relief sought.

111. The Claimant’s application for a PMO was therefore dismissed.

53 See also Paushok v. Government of Mongolia, Order on Interim Measures at para. 45 (UNCITRAL Sept.
2, 2009).

“[Flive standards have to be met”... (1) prima facie jurisdiction. (2) prima facie establishment of
the case, (3) urgency, (4) imminent danger of serious prejudice (necessity) and (5) proportionality.”

XI. DECISION ON THE MERITS OF THE MATERIAL BREACH
APPLICATION

112. For the foregoing reasons the Claimant’s Material Breach Application pursuant to
Article 32 of the Deed of Settlement dated 15 June 2014 as clarified by the Side Letter

dated 18 June 2014 is dismissed.

XII. DISPOSITION OF COSTS

113. The Claimant will be ordered to pay the Respondent Government’s costs of the
arbitration. If the parties can agree on an appropriate amount, the said amount will be
incorporated in the Tribunal’s Award. If no agreement on costs is reached, the Respondent
Government is to make its submission on costs to the Tribunal within 60 days of this date.
The Claimant will have 30 days from the filing of that submission to reply to it. The
Respondent will have 30 days from the filing of the Claimant’s Reply to make its response.
The Tribunal will then proceed to make its Award under Article 52 of the Arbitration
(Additional Facility) Rules of ICSID incorporating both the reasons herein on the merits

and its disposition of costs.

INTRODUCTION

In its Decision on the Merits dated 10 June 2015, the Tribunal directed, pursuant to

Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, that the Government of

Laos People’s Democratic Republic (the “Government”) be awarded costs against the

Claimant, Laos Holdings (the “Claimant”, as a result of the unsuccessful allegation by the

Claimant of a material breach of the Settlement Agreement dated 15 June 2014 and side

letter dated 17 June 2014 (the “Material Breach Application”).

I.

a)

3.

THE LAW AND THE FACTS
The law
Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (AF) Rules provides that:

Article 58

(1) Unless the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom
the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of
the Secretariat and the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the
proceeding shall be borne. The Tribunal may, to that end, call on the Secretariat
and the parties to provide it with the information it needs in order to formulate the
division of the cost of the proceeding between the parties.

(2) The decision of the Tribunal pursuant to paragraph (1) of this Article shall form
part of the award.

This Article gives a broad discretion to the Tribunal in the allocation of costs,

according to all the circumstances of the case.

b) The facts

4.

Pursuant to the Decision on the Merits, counsel for the Government has submitted

aclaim for fees in the sum of USD $684,007.75 and disbursements of USD $78,698.08 for

a total of USD $762,705.83.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 263 of 457

5. The Material Breach Application was based essentially on an allegation that the
Government had either licensed or agreed to license a rival casino contrary to the 50-year
monopoly conferred on the Claimant’s subsidiary by agreement with the Government. The
establishment of a rival casino, according to the Claimant, destroyed much of the value of
its investment and essentially rendered it unmarketable except at an unacceptable discount

to the fair market of its gambling facilities predicated on a monopoly concession.

6. The Government’s ultimate success turned on the testimony of public servants and
other witnesses given at the hearing in Singapore on 13-14 April 2015. The Claimant’s
allegation of a breach of its monopoly was shown to be based on erroneous newspaper
reports and the activities of promoters of a rival casino who acted without the

Government’s approval or encouragement.

7. The Claimant was unable to present direct evidence in support of its Material
Breach Application and such secondary inferences as were available were persuasively

refuted by testimony by the Government officials most directly involved.

8. A list of the submissions, decisions and hearings in the Material Breach Application

is attached hereto as Appendix “‘A” to these reasons.

9. In as

 

‘ssing the Government’s costs of its successful defence, the Tribunal should
attempt to assess a quantum that is fair and reasonable to both parties in all the

circumstances.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 264 of 457

c) The Government’s bill of costs
10. The Government’s skeleton bill of costs is set out in a one and a quarter page chart
identifying the lawyers or paralegals who worked on the case, their hourly rate and total
billing for each individual, as well as a statement of disbursements. The document is

attached as Appendix “B” to these reasons.

11. The Tribunal has been provided with little in the way of submissions by either party.

12. The Claimant takes the position that considerable time and costs were unnecessarily
thrown away on an ultimately unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge and related procedural
issues. To further its argument, the Claimant requested copies of the billing records of the
Respondent Government to determine how much time was spent on various unsuccessful
procedures in the course of its defence against the Material Breach Application. The
records were refused by the Government on the basis that at New York law, being the
governing law of the Deed of Settlement, “billing time sheets are privileged and are not
produced to opposing counsel”. The Claimant contests that position. The Tribunal
considers it unnecessary to resolve this particular dispute and will proceed on the basis of

the material now made available to it.

Ill. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS
a) Reasonableness of time and hours spent
13. The Tribunal has taken into account the following considerations:
(a) The quantum of costs claimed by the Government is proportionate to the

importance and the complexity of the issues at stake.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 265 of 457

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

The amount of time docketed by the various lawyers and paralegals is not
excessive given the degree of responsibility assumed by counsel acting on

behalf of the Government and the monetary value of the matters in issue.

The rates are reasonable in the surrounding circumstances. Lead counsel
for the Government are experienced lawyers in matters of international
commercial law and their rates are in line with rates charged by counsel of

comparable skill and experience in matters of similar value and complexity.

The work’s organisation was efficient. It appears from the distribution of
hours amongst counsel that appropriate measures were taken by senior
counsel to delegate to more junior counsel (at a lower hourly rate) work

suitable to their level of experience.

In the end result, the Government was entirely successful on the merits in

resisting the Material Breach Application of the Claimant.

b) The unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge

While the Tribunal accepts that the time shown in the Government’s bill of costs

was in fact spent by each of the persons listed, and that their hourly rates are reasonable,
the Government’s success rested almost entirely on the factual evidence presented in
Singapore on 13-14 April 2015. Prior to that date, there was much procedural skirmishing,
particularly in relation to the Government’s unsuccessful challenge to the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal even to embark on its mandate to consider the Claimant’s Material Breach
Application. The Tribunal gave extensive reasons for its conclusion that there was no merit

to this challenge. After the point was decided adversely to the Government, it launched an

4

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 266 of 457

unsuccessful Request for Re-consideration which essentially repeated the arguments
already made and already rejected by the Tribunal in the original (and unsuccessful)

jurisdictional challenge.

15. In the Tribunal’s view, while the Government was certainly entitled to bring its
jurisdictional challenge, it is not fair and reasonable to ask the Claimant to fully indemnify
the Government against the cost of procedural skirmishing that served no purpose other

than a distraction from the factual issues before the Tribunal.

c) Are there other elements to take into consideration?
16. In the Tribunal’s view, the Government case was made in a professional manner
with due regard to economy and efficiency. However, the assessment of the Government’s
costs must take into account its unnecessary and unsuccessful procedural manoeuvres.
Reference should also be made to the fact that the Claimant lost two successive Requests
for Provisional Measures, respectively dated 19 January 2015 and 2 April 2015. The

Tribunal rejected both requests, respectively on 18 March 2015 and 14 April 2015.

17. As the Government has declined to produce records that would enable the Tribunal
to calculate more precisely the amount of time consumed by its jurisdictional challenges
and related motions, the Tribunal will simply apply a percentage reduction as hereinafter

specified.

d) Disbursements
18. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt the justification for any of the disbursements.
As the Government points out, USD $93,849.00 is a reasonable sum for out-of-pocket

expenses for a ten-month case where the client is in Laos, witnesses were in Laos and Kuala

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 267 of 457

Lumpur, and hearings were held in Washington and Singapore. The Claimant requested
the presence in Singapore of the Government officials for whose expenses it is now being

called on to pay.

19. The Washington hearing (and associated costs), however, was entirely dedicated to

the Government’s unsuccessful jurisdictional challenge and related issues.

IV. CONCLUSION
20. In light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the quantum of
costs claimed by the Government, exceeds what is fair and reasonable to call upon the

Claimant to pay.

21. As the Government has declined to produce any breakdown of the activities in
respect of which costs are claimed (apart from research on the interpretation of the Deed
of Settlement under New York law and development of the Government’s position in that
regard), the Tribunal is left with the option of assessing a global factor to determine a fair

and reasonable award of costs relative to the work done and the result accomplished.

22. The Tribunal concludes that the decision should be 70% of the total claim of

USD $762,705.83.

23. The Tribunal therefore awards to the Respondent costs and legal fees of

USD $533,894.08.

24. Pursuant to paragraphs 31 and 32 of the Settlement Agreement dated 15 June 2014,

this proceeding remains suspended.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 281 of 457

I. INTRODUCTION
i. The Parties

1. The Claimant, Lao Holdings N.V. (“LHNV”), owned gambling assets in Laos
including the Savan Vegas Hotel and a Casino Complex in Savannakhet Province.
The Casino is strategically located near the Friendship Bridge which spans the
Mekong River between Laos and Thailand. The Claimant also had an investment
in two “slot clubs.” As a result of what it considered to be treaty violations, the
Claimant LHNV, a company incorporated under the laws of Aruba in the
Netherlands Antilles, initiated proceedings on 14 August 2012 against the
Respondent, the Government of The Lao People’s Democratic Republic (the
“Government”), before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID). The claim was made pursuant to the Agreement on
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the
Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of
ICSID.?

2. Parallel proceedings were initiated against the Government by the Claimant, Sanum
Investments Limited, a LHNV subsidiary which operated the Savan Vegas Hotel
and Casino, before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) for alleged violations
of the Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and

the Government of The Lao People’s Democratic Republic Concerning The

' Signed on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 2005.
2 As amended on 10 April 2006.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 282 of 457

Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated January 31, 1993
and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010.

While the proceedings before the two Tribunals are distinct and separate, the
current application was the subject of a joint hearing in Singapore on 3 and 4 July
2017. Accordingly, for ease of reference only, LHNV will be referred to in this
Ruling as "the Claimants", as its case is intermingled with the Sanum case. This
terminology is not to suggest, however, that the two arbitral proceedings are

consolidated or otherwise conjoined.

ii, The Treaty Claims

The Claimants allege expropriation without compensation of their investment in
gambling projects described in the Project Development Agreement (“PDA”) dated
10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, as well as the slot clubs
located at the border at Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry Terminal (located at the
Savannakhet/Mukdahan checkpoint) all in Savannakhet Province (collectively, the
“Gaming Assets”). The claims also relate to the expected expansion of the
Savannakhet Airport and opportunities for development in the Special Economic
Zone at Thakheak.

The Claimants’ original treaty claims were based on a multiplicity of alleged treaty
breaches by the Government including an 80% tax on casino revenues and what the
Claimants contended were unfair and oppressive audits of the Savan Vegas Hotel

and Casino. In the treaty proceedings, the Claimants eventually valued their

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 283 of 457

investment loss as of 31 August 2016 at between USD $690 million and USD $1

billion?

iii, The Settlement

The treaty claims were thought to be resolved by a Deed of Settlement concluded
between the parties during the merits hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014 (to be
read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to collectively
as “the Settlement”).

Shortly after the Settlement, the Claimants alleged that the Government had
committed a material breach of its terms which entitled them to revive the Treaty
arbitration (“the First Material Breach Application”). The Government contested
jurisdiction. On 11 August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with
the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) pursuant to Paragraphs 35
and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum to comply with its
settlement obligations.

The ICSID and PCA Tribunals held a hearing on the objections to jurisdiction,
which were dismissed. However, on 20 January 2015, the High Court of the
Republic of Singapore held that the PCA Tribunal did not possess subject matter
jurisdiction under the 31 January 1993 Investment Treaty between Laos and China
because of the status of Macao and issues of state succession not here relevant, as

well as the limitation in the BIT, according to which “only disputes over the amount

2017.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 284 of 457

of compensation for expropriation can be submitted to arbitration.” This judgment

was later reversed by the Court of Appeal for Singapore on 29 September 2016.°

9. In the meantime, the ICSID proceedings continued. After hearing the parties on
the merits, this Tribunal delivered a decision on 10 June 2015, dismissing the First
Material Breach Application.

II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THE SECOND MATERIAL BREACH
APPLICATION

10. On 26 April 2016, the Claimant LHNV submitted a Second Material Breach
Application to the ICSID Tribunal with accompanying documentation.

11. On 29 April 2016, the Government informed ICSID that it would be submitting a

response to the Second Material Breach Application which, when filed on 12 May
2016, included its Objections to Jurisdiction and a request for a procedural

conference.

i. The Objections to Jurisdiction
On 24 June 2016, the Government requested a stay of the ICSID proceedings
pending the outcome of the SIAC proceedings. Subsequently, the SIAC Tribunal
rejected Sanum’s request for interim measures to block the Government’s seizure

and proposed sale of the Gaming Assets.

13. On 29 June 2016, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference call with the parties.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 285 of 457

14. On 30 June 2016, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Bifurcation ordering a separate
hearing with respect to the Government’s objections to jurisdiction.

15. On 16 September 2016, the Government submitted to the Tribunal a request for
security for costs.

16. On 7 October 2016, the Claimant LHNV submitted a response opposing the
Government’s objections to jurisdiction, the motion to stay the proceedings and the
request for security for costs.

17. On 18 October 2016, the Tribunal and the parties held a hearing on the
Government’s objections to jurisdiction in Brussels, Belgium. At the beginning of
the hearing, the Government informed the Tribunal that it withdrew its objections
to jurisdiction as they were now moot.

18. On 20 October 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8, amended on 21
October 2016, in respect of the agreed upon filing dates, rejecting the request to
stay the current proceedings, but setting out a schedule that was expected to
accommodate the time required by the SIAC Tribunal to complete its deliberations.
The Tribunal also rejected the Government’s request for an order for security for
costs.

ii, The Sanum Proceedings Before the Permanent Court of
Arbitration are Revived

19. On 23 February 2017, the Claimant Sanum filed a Second Material Breach
Application before the PCA Tribunal, which had been revived, as mentioned, by a

decision of the Singapore Court of Appeals dated 29 September 2016.°

On 6 March 2017, the Claimants submitted a request for the production of
documents. On 17 March 2017, the Government responded. On 31 March 2017,
the Claimants submitted a reply. On 3 April 2017, the Claimants’ request for
production of documents was dismissed in light of the parties’ prior agreement to
forgo a fresh document production phase and the lack of any compelling
circumstances to order otherwise.

On 16 March 2017, the Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits of the
Second Material Breach Application with accompanying documentation. On 5 May
2017, the Government submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Claimants’ Second
Material Breach Application, with accompanying documentation. On 31 May 2017,
the Claimants submitted their Reply and on 21 June 2017, the Government

submitted its Rejoinder.

iii. |The Hearing on the Merits

On 30 June 2017, shortly before the scheduled hearing of the Second Material
Breach Application on the merits, the Government filed with this Tribunal the Final
Award in this dispute from the SIAC Tribunal, Case No. ARB143/14/MV, rendered
on 29 June 2017 (which had been notified to the parties on 30 June 2017).

On 3 and 4 July 2017, the ICSID and PCA Tribunals proceeded with the merits
hearing of the Claimants’ Second Material Breach Application at Maxwell
Chambers in Singapore. At the hearing, counsel for both parties presented
comprehensive submissions to the Tribunals.

On 8 July 2017, the Government announced that it would be formally requesting

from this Tribunal a Mareva Injunction to secure funds in the escrow account under

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 287 of 457

the control of the SIAC Tribunal to ensure payment to the Government of any
potential award of costs in the event of a dismissal of the Claimants’ Second
Material Breach Application. On 9 July 2017, the Government filed a formal
application for a Mareva Injunction with accompanying documentation. By
communication of 10 July 2017, the Tribunal established an expedited schedule for
further submissions, which were exchanged by the parties.

25. On 17 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 dismissing the
Government’s Application for a Mareva Injunction and reserving any award of
costs until rendering a decision on the merits of the Second Material Breach

Application.

Ill. BACKGROUND TO THE SECOND MATERIAL BREACH APPLICATION
26. As stated, the treaty claims were thought to be resolved by the Settlement. The
Settlement contemplated the sale of the Gaming Assets by the Claimants within 10
months, failing which a third party agreeable to both the Claimants and the
Government would assume management of the gambling facilities pending their
sale on “a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds to the Claimants and Laos”?

including assurances to a new purchaser of the Gaming Assets of:
(a) a continued gambling monopoly for 50 years in the Claimants’ area of

exclusivity®;

(b) a “new” flat tax;° and

§ Settlement, Section 6.
° Settlement, Section 8.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 288 of 457

(c) discontinuance of pending criminal investigations. !°

27. It was agreed that the Government would appoint RMC Gaming Management LLC
(“RMC’) or other suitable agent to assist in monitoring the Claimants’ Gaming
Assets pending a sale and to assist with the sale itself!! as described in Annex E to
the Settlement.

28. The parties agreed that the Settlement would be “governed by and construed solely
in accordance with the laws of New York”!? coupled with a somewhat complex
dispute resolution mechanism:

(a) The Tribunal was given exclusive jurisdiction to revive the “suspended”
treaty proceedings in the event of a material breach of a section or
sections of the Settlement specified and listed under Section 32, “if not

remedied within 45 days after receipt of notice of such breach”; '?

'© Settlement, Section 23.

'' Settlement, Section 9.

!? Settlement, Section 42.

8 Section 32 provides:
The Claimants shall only be permitted to revive the arbitration in the event that Laos is in material
breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28 above and only after reasonable written notice is
given to Laos by the Claimants of such breach and such breach is not remedied within 45 days after
receipt of notice of such breach. The Sale Deadline and any other relevant time periods herein
shall be extended by the length of time required to cure such breach, In the event that there is
a dispute as to whether or not Laos is in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28
above, the Tribunals shall determine whether or not there has been such a material breach and shall
only revive the arbitration if they conclude that there has been such a material breach. (emphasis
added)

Section 35 provides:
In the event that the Claimants fail to comply with their obligations under this Deed, Laos shall be
entitled to commence a fresh arbitration to enforce the terms of this Deed. Such arbitration shall be
conducted in Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre for the time being in force. The seat of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The
Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each Party shall nominate one arbitrator and the two
nominated arbitrators shall nominate the presiding arbitrator. In the event that the two nominated
arbitrators are unable to agree on a presiding arbitrator, the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed

(b) All other disputes arising out of the Settlement would be referred to the
Singapore Centre for International Arbitration (SIAC) under Section 35
and Section 42.'4

29. The Government paid no financial compensation to the Claimants under or in
respect of the Settlement.

30. Following the execution of the Settlement, Sanum continued to operate the Casino.
The Government nominated Mr. Robert Russell (the CEO of RMC) on 20 June
2014 to serve on the Flat Tax Committee (“FTC”), and Sanum nominated Mr. Steve
Rittvo (Chairman of Innovation Group and adviser to and expert witness for

Sanum) on 25 June 2014.!>

i. The First Material Breach Application
31. However, as stated, on 27 June 2014, nine days after the Settlement and the Consent
Award issued was executed, LHNV and Sanum gave Notice of a Material Breach

alleging that the Government’s violations of the Settlement “entitle[d] Claimants

by the President of the SIAC Court of Arbitration. The language of the arbitration shall be English.
(emphasis added)

4 Section 42 provides as follows:
This Deed shall be governed by and construed solely in accordance with the laws of New York.
Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Deed, including any question regarding its
existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in
Singapore in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore International
Arbitration Centre for the time being in force, including its emergency arbitration rules. The seat
of the arbitration shall be Singapore. The Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators. Each Party
shall nominate one arbitrator and the two nominated arbitrators shall nominate the presiding
arbitrator. In the event that the two nominated arbitrators are unable to agree on a presiding
arbitrator, the presiding arbitrator shall be appointed by the President of the SIAC Court of
Arbitration. The language of the arbitration shall be English. (emphasis added)

16 under Section 32 of the

to revive the international arbitration proceedings:
Settlement.
The Material Breach Notice alleged in particular that the Government had violated
Section 6 of the Settlement by granting or approving the grant of a gaming licence
to a rival casino or casinos within Sanum’s area of exclusivity, thereby substantially
reducing the price at which the Claimants’ Gaming Assets could be expected to be
sold to prospective purchasers. The breach was said to be so serious and
fundamental as not to be “susceptible to cure due to the irreversible impact on the
pool of buyers for the asset.”!7 Moreover, in any event, the Claimants took the
position that under Section 32 of the Settlement “‘all deed deadlines in the Deed and
Side Letter are extended by the length of time required to cure this breach.” !®
ii. The Claimants’ Conduct Pending a Decision on the First Material
Breach Application and the Impact on Subsequent Events, Rights
and Responsibilities

On 2 July 2014, the Claimants sent the Government a further email taking a more

nuanced position on the suspension of deadlines, namely that while:

[nJeither the Deed nor the Side Letter expressly addresses what
happens with respect to the parties’ performance during the 45-
day cure period contemplated by Section 32 of the Deed,
...Claimants hereby ‘suspend[ed] further performance under the
Deed and Side Letter, at least until we have [the Government’s]
response to the Material Breach Notice. (emphasis added)

The Claimants proceeded to suspend (i) their participation in the work of the FT
Committee to appoint a third member, and (ii) the monthly payments of RMC’s
fees as required under Annex E of the Deed.!?

That same day, 2 July 2014, the Claimants expressly instructed Mr. Rittvo not to
participate in the FT Committee.”?

The Government responded by sending Sanum an email, also on 2 July 2014,
asserting that if RMC were not paid, the Government would apply to SIAC to
appoint RMC to take control of the Casino and to sell it.7!

Despite what it regarded as bad faith conduct by the Claimants, the Government
never did take steps to terminate the Settlement as threatened on 2 July 2014 or
otherwise.

On 4 July 2014, the Claimants filed their formal Application for Finding of Material
Breach of Deed of Settlement and for Reinstatement of Arbitration in the Treaty
arbitration.

On 11 July 2014, the Government responded by asserting (and enclosing evidence)

that:

In fact, there has been no grant of a license, no grant of permission,
no grant of any kind that will allow the operation of a new casino
in Savannakhet, Laos. That is a fact. The Government attaches
letters from the relevant officials who have personal
knowledge of the recent transactions that state unequivocally
that there is no casino in the new development plans. (emphasis
added)

On 11 August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with SIAC
pursuant to Sections 35 and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum
to comply with its obligations under the Settlement, including a declaration that the
waiver of overdue taxes contained in Section 7 of the Settlement was no longer
binding on the Government, because Sanum refused to proceed with the
establishment of a Flat Tax Committee or to cooperate with RMC’s monitoring of
Savan Vegas pending the sale of the Casino, plus compensation, costs and interest
on all monies due.
The Government thereby continued to affirm the Settlement notwithstanding what
it regarded as the Claimants’ bad faith breaches of the Settlement.
Sanum responded in the SIAC proceedings with a request for:

The Government Moves Ahead to Establish a Flat Tax Committee

On 5 December 2014, approximately six months after the Settlement had been
executed, and there being no cooperation from the Claimants regarding formation
of the Flat Tax Committee, the Government wrote to the President of the Macau
Society of Registered Accountants pursuant to Section 9 of the Settlement
explaining that a three-member committee was to be formed to determine a flat tax
and requesting that the President assist in “‘secur[ing] the appointment of the third
member of the Committee.” It was specified that “[t]he person will be a member
of your Society familiar with the taxation of casinos.”
The Government then wrote to Sanum on 24 December 2014 requesting it to
facilitate

... the orderly process of the exchange of control due on 15 April

2105, in the event Sanum/LH does not complete a sale or have in

place an MOU, as stated in the Deed.**
On 29 December 2014, while the First Material Breach Application was still
pending, the Government sent a notice to Mr. John Baldwin and Claimants’ counsel
advising that if the Claimants did not participate in forming the FT Committee and

the Flat Tax Agreement expired, Laotian tax law would apply at a rate of 35% plus

10% VAT.>

23 See SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 95.

25 See SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 97 (Letter from Laos’ Ministry of Finance to John Baldwin

and Christopher Tahbaz, 29 December 2014):

The Ministry of Finance has been requested by the Committee Supervising the Sanum Settlement
to assist in compliance with the tax aspects of the Deed of Settlement (Deed). According to the
Deed, the parties were to have agreed to a procedure to set a Flat Tax for Savan Vegas and Casino

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 294 of 457

47. The existing Flat Tax Agreement expired according to its terms on December 31,
2013.76

48. The Claimants maintained their position that all rights and obligations under the
Settlement (including the obligation to pay tax and to cooperate with the
establishment of a “new” flat tax) were suspended pending a resolution of their
First Material Breach Application.

49. On 6 January 2015, RMC, which had previously stopped working “as a result of

the lack of cooperation and payment from Savan Vegas”, and had declined to step

Co. (Savan Vegas). We understand that Sanum Investments Limited (Sanum) and Lao Holdings
NV (LH) are refusing to comply with that procedure.
It is not acceptable to the Government of the Lao PDR that a large gaming establishment operating
with the good licenses of the Government simply refuses to pay taxes to the Government ... The
Ministry of Finance requests compliance by Sanum, LH and Savan Vegas with the laws of the
Government of the Lao PDR in connection with proper taxation of the gross gaming revenues of the
Savan Vegas casino, operated in Savannakhet Province of the Lao PDR ... A failure to execute a
Flat Tax Agreement within 30 days as required by your agreement with the Government will
lead to the imposition of tax according to the laws, based upon the requested financial reports.
We call to your attention that by Presidential Decree, dated 24 October 2014, amending Article 20,
point 2, of the Tax Law, the tax rate on Savan Vegas gaming revenues has been set to 35%. In
addition, 10% VAT applies to such revenues.
If there is no cooperation in submitting the financial reports within 15 days, a Tax Order will be sent
to Savan Vegas for the last six months of 2014, based upon the new Tax Law and the above stated
estimate of revenue for 2013. If after payment of taxes so imposed, the parties later agree to a Flat
Tax with retroactive effect, the Ministry will make adjustments accordingly. (emphasis added)
26 See Agreement No. 2569 dated 1 September 2009 Regarding Flat Tax Payment for Casino Busines
Savan Vegas and Casino between Tax Department, Financial Management Government Enterprises
Department and Savan Vegas and Casino Company, Ltd.: (LHNV Exhibit C-7)
In order to assure that the payment of taxes of Savan Vegas and Casino Limited to the Government
of Lao PDR is fit with actual business activity and is in line with the laws and regulations of Lao
PDR as issued periodically, both parties agree to make this Flat Tax Agreement for the
experimental period of 5 years. This agreement shall begin the 1* of January 2009 to the 31
of December 2013.
Article 1: | Savan Vegas and Casino, LTD agrees to pay the government Flat Tax which
specifically covers the Casino Business and includes Excise tax, turn over tax, profit tax, Dividend
tax, and dividend which is included in the Flat Tax (see “Dividend” of below timetable) and is in an
amount of $745,000 (seven hundred forty-five thousand dollars) per year. The payment shall
be split into 4 payments, in the period of 3 months each. The Flat Tax shall be paid to the Provincial
Tax Department of Savannkhet Province but the dividend portion of the Flat Tax shall be paid to
the Ministry of Finance through State Enterprise Finance Supervision Department. (emphasis
added)

in to act as the “qualified gaming operator” of Savan Vegas, were Sanum to fail to
sell the Casino by the deadline of 15 April 2015,?’ recommended that in its place,
the Government appoint San Marco Capital Partners LLC (“San Marco”) and its
president, Ms. Kelly Gass, to manage and sell the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino.
50. On 19 January 2015, the Claimants sought to block the Government’s plan to
market the Casino by filing a further Application for Provisional Measures before
the ICSID Tribunal requesting an order prohibiting the Government from:
(a) Applying a 45% tax (35% plus 10% VAT) on gross gaming revenues to
Savan Vegas;
(b) Seizing the Casino; and
(c) Taking any steps that would alter the status quo of the dispute pending
the resolution by the Tribunal of the Claimants’ First Material Breach

Application.”*

iv. The Government Moves Ahead with the Sale
51. Events continued to progress. On 7 March 2015, the President of the Macau
Society of Registered Accountants appointed Mr. Quin Va, a Macau registered

accountant and qualified auditor, to be the Chair of the Flat Tax Committee.” (The

Government did not formally retain Mr. Va until 15 May 2015.79)

6 January 2015).

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 296 of 457

52. The ICSID Tribunal held a telephone hearing on 10 March 2015 in respect of the
Claimants’ pending Application for Provisional Measures. During this hearing, the
Government declared that it would proceed to form the FT Committee without the

Claimants’ participation:

The Government contends ... that it is open to the Government to
have the Flat Tax Committee constituted without the cooperation
of [Sanum] by resorting under Article 9 of the Deed of Settlement,
to the President of the Macao Society of Registered
Accountants.*!

53. On 18 March 2015, the ICSID Tribunal denied the Claimants’ Second Application

for Provisional Measures, stating in relevant part:

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimant has not established a case for
relief from the collection of the 45% tax on gross gaming revenues
enacted in October 2014.**

The Tribunal notes that the Government was quite prepared to
proceed with the renegotiation of a Flat Tax Agreement under the
Terms of the Settlement and in fact appointed its nominee early in
July 2014. The Claimant has refused to participate as part of its
broader disagreement with the Government of Laos over the status
of the Deed of Settlement.

When the Flat Tax Agreement expired on 31 December [2013],
Savan Vegas became subject to the applicable tax laws of Laos.
It is common ground that although Savan Vegas has continued to
do business in Laos, it has not paid taxes either directly or in
escrow since | January 2014. While it now offers to pay in escrow
the sum of US $429,300 per month retroactive to 1 January 2014,
there is no obligation on the Government to agree to such a figure
or to any escrow arrangement.**

... [FJor so long as the Claimant continues to do business in Laos,
it can reasonably expect to be bound by the Laotian income tax
laws applicable to gambling casinos unless and until a new Flat
Tax Agreement is negotiated.**

54. On 30 March 2015, the Government again reiterated by letter to the Claimants the
Government’s intention to take control of Savan Vegas on 15 April 2015, unless
Sanum had either completed a sale or had signed a binding MOU with a purchaser
of Savan Vegas. Nothing less would extend Sanum’s sale deadline (under the terms
of Section 11 of the Settlement).*> The letter also referenced the decision of the
ICSID Tribunal to reject the Application for Provisional Measures. The
Government stated that:

the Government is not enjoined from proceeding to complete the
takeover of the Gaming Assets (and further not enjoined from
enforcing the outstanding tax invoices sent to Savan Vegas in
January 2015) ... We trust Sanum/LH will now agree to
cooperate to ensure a peaceful turnover. (emphasis added)

55. The letter concluded by inviting Sanum:

to be in contact with the Ministry of Planning and Investment ...
to set forth [Sanum’s] proposed compliance with these
important terms of the Deed [of Settlement]. (emphasis added)

56. The Claimants persisted in the view that while their First Material Breach
Application was still pending, their obligations under the Settlement were

suspended, as were the rights of the Government to proceed to take control of Savan

Vegas and sell it.

y. The ICSID Tribunal Rejects the Claimants’ First Material Breach
Application

57. On 13 and 14 April 2015, the ICSID Tribunal held a hearing on the merits of the
First Material Breach Application in Singapore. On the evening of 14 April 2015,
following the conclusion of the hearing, the Tribunal emailed both parties its
decision not to grant the Claimants’ request for a provisional measure to prohibit

the Government from proceeding with the take-over of the Savan Vegas Casino:

The Tribunal is seized of [a] request for Provisional Measures in
support of the Claimant’s Material Breach Application. Having
deliberated ... the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed
to establish all of the requisite elements for such an order, and
therefore dismisses the application, with reasons to follow.**

58. It later emerged that during the Singapore hearing,*’ Mr. Shawn Scott, Mr.
Baldwin’s partner, initiated a discussion with a Mr. Angus Noble about the
potential purchase and sale of the Casino. On the evening of 14 April 2015, at
23:04, shortly after receipt of notification of the ICSID Tribunal’s refusal of
provisional measures, and minutes before the expiry of the deadline to sell the
Casino, Sanum provided to the Government a MOU signed by Mr. Angus Noble
on behalf of his company, MaxGaming Consulting Services, Ltd. (“MaxGaming”),
to purchase the Casino. The Government declined to take the Noble MOU

seriously and was later vindicated by the SIAC Tribunal which concluded after

hearing all the evidence that the Noble MOU was not a serious document but a

worthless device designed simply to extend the time of Sanum’s operation of the

Casino.**

vi. The Government’s Seizure and Sale of the Casino
59. On 16 April 2015, one day after the expiry of the Claimants’ deadline to sell the
Casino, the Government took control of the Casino. It appointed San Marco to

manage and operate the Gaming Assets pending a sale.

vii. |The Change of Position of Sanum Seeking to Participate in the Sale
Process

60. On 5 May 2015, the Claimants changed direction and proposed to “try to work
together to sell the property.” The Government declined the offer. The
Government made it clear that the effort to sell Savan Vegas “will not be a joint
effort; the Government will adopt a procedure to have a due diligence room, and
create a fair process for accepting bids and evaluating them ... the Government will
not allow ... Mr. Crawford [a senior Sanum employee] on the premises. He is free
of course to meet anyone off the property and say what he wishes, but he must not
be offered as an agent or emissary of the Government.”*”

61. Once again, the Government thereby affirmed the agreement to sell the Casino

under the authority of the Settlement, but to do so on the Government’s own terms.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 300 of 457

viii. The Ad Valorem Tax Rate of Mr. Va

62. On 15 May 2015, the Government formally engaged Mr. Va to be the sole member
of the FT Committee and to determine the tax to be paid by Savan Vegas.” The
Government provided Mr. Va with three documents: (i) a Gaming Tax
Recommendation by BDO that described tax rates in other Asian jurisdictions; (ii)
a Report to the Flat Tax Committee that described the tax situation with the other
two casinos in Laos; and (iii) the Taxation Opinion of Professor Rose.*! No
documents were passed to Mr. Va by or on behalf of the Claimants, who were
unaware at the time of Mr. Va’s appointment.

63. It is not clear to what extent, if at all, Mr. Va was briefed on the “old” flat tax
arrangement between Savan Vegas and the Government dated 1 September 2009
which was to be replaced by the “new” flat tax he was to recommend.

64. On 23 May 2015, Sanum wrote to the Government to indicate that it was prepared
to resume participation in the FT Committee if the ICSID Tribunal were to deny

the Claimant LHNV’s First Material Breach Application:

In the event that the ICSID tribunal denies the Material Breach
Application, then that suspension [of performance of the
Settlement] comes to an end and performance of the Parties’
obligations under the Settlement resumes ... On this basis ... our
clients write with regard to the immediate steps that should be
taken by the Parties to move forward now with the Settlement.

FT Committee ... Prior to the suspension of the Deed in June
2014, the Government had appointed Robert Russell of RMC
Consulting to sit on the Committee, while our clients had
appointed Steven Rittvo ... Please confirm that Mr. Russell
remains the Government’s nominee to the Committee. As soon

as we receive that confirmation, Mr. Rittvo will reach out to
Mr. Russell in order to agree the third FT Committee
Member.” (emphasis added)
65. The Government rejected the proposal (conditional in any event on the outcome of

the First Material Breach Application) to proceed by way of a three members Flat

Tax Committee.

ix. The Government Announces a New Plan to Sell the Casino
66. On 29 May 2015, the Government filed with the SIAC Tribunal its Response to the
Claimants’ Amended Provisional Measures Application. The Government
acknowledged that it had seized the Savan Vegas Casino and intended to proceed
unilaterally with its sale as follows:

(a) the Government will terminate the Savan Vegas Project Development
Agreement (2007);

(b) the Government will form a Newco;

(c) the Government will grant Newco a 50 years concession agreement to
operate the Casino, a gaming license and land concession the day it
terminates the [2007] PDA;

(d) the Government will have an independent expert set a flat tax which
will be enshrined in the Newco concession agreement;

(e) on completion of the audit [of Savan Vegas], the Government will put
Newco on the market for sale by auction; the audit should be complete

by mid-July;

70.

(f) when the bids are evaluated, and the highest bid selected, Newco will
be sold;
(g) the Government will pay Sanum its share of the proceeds;
(h) the Government expects to close the sale before year-end.**
The Government’s proposed procedure did not comply (and did not purport to

comply) with the terms of the Settlement.

x. The Recommendation of a 28% Ad Valorem Tax by Mr. Va

On 9 June 2015, Mr. Quin Va produced his report on the taxation of Savan Vegas.
He considered the existing Laotian taxation system and relevant Government
policies, the taxation policy of other countries in the region in relation to gambling
businesses and their comparative advantages and disadvantages, the current size of
Savan Vegas, the current market position of Laos in the Asian gaming industry and
the impact of the gaming policies of Thailand (Savan Vegas’ largest source of
gamblers). Mr. Va recommended that Savan Vegas be taxed on an ad valorem
basis at the rate of 28% of gross gaming revenue (“GGR”).“

The evidence is that during the period between his appointment (15 May 2015 when
he received the three reports referred to earlier*) and the issuance of his report (9
June 2015), Mr. Va had no discussions or communications with the Claimants.
Mr. Va gave no weight (if he was aware of it) to the earlier 1 September 2009 Flat

Tax Agreement between Sanum and the Government for a “flat tax” of the fixed

amount of US $745,000 per year for 5 years, ending 31 December 2013, with the
possibility of a renewal.“
71. On 10 June 2015, the ICSID Tribunal issued reasons“ for its dismissal on the merits
of the Claimant LHNV’s First Material Breach Application.
xi. The Reliance on the Settlement both by the Government and Sanum
at the SIAC Hearing on 16 June 2015
72. The SIAC Tribunal convened a hearing on 16 June 2015 to deal with all pending
interim relief sought by Sanum. In its decision of 29 June 2015, the SIAC Tribunal
noted:
At that hearing before this Tribunal, both Laos and Sanum
specifically reiterated their desire to enforce the Deed to
effectuate the sale of the Casino and agreed that the Deed’s
fundamental purpose was to sell the Casino at the maximum price
possible and divide the proceeds 80/20 between Sanum and
Laos.** (emphasis added)
73. Itis therefore clear that despite what the Government considered to be the wrongful
and provocative conduct of the Claimants referred to above, the Government
elected “to enforce the Deed [of Settlement].” (Sanum had earlier asked SIAC to

rescind the Settlement.) The Government made it clear it had no desire to return to

the status quo ante. The SIAC Tribunal continued:

75.

Laos also stated that it had appointed Mr. Va to unilaterally
determine the tax rate and that he had already done so.*?

On 18 June 2015, Laos terminated the 2007 PDA with Sanum,

asserting its right to do so “pursuant to the terms of the PDA, the

provisions of the Law on Investment Promotion (2009) and other

applicable laws of the Lao PDR” and citing, among other reasons,

Sanum’s non-payment of taxes.*°
On 30 June 2015, the SIAC Tribunal denied Sanum’s Application for Provisional
Measures, seeking a reversion of the operation of the Savan Vegas Casino to Sanum
and a prohibition of the termination of the 2007 PDA. However, the SIAC Tribunal
did order the Government to provide Sanum with regular and ongoing financial
information including any developments in respect of marketing initiatives. The
SIAC Tribunal also observed that the Government had acknowledged that it had,
as did its agent San Marco, a “fiduciary duty to Sanum in managing the casino and

51

making efforts to obtain the maximum price at a sale.

xii. |The Government Takes Ownership of the Gambling Assets
On 28 September 2015, the Government issued a decree transferring all assets
owned by the Claimants (but not the corporate liabilities) to Savan Lao, a new entity
(earlier identified as Newco) that was solely owned by the Government, in order to
accomplish the sale contemplated in the Settlement, but on terms decided by the
Government and fully disclosed to the SIAC Tribunal. In doing so, the Government

claimed to be acting pursuant to the Settlement.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 305 of 457

76. After receiving draft versions of San Marco’s marketing documents at the end of
September 2015, Sanum objected to the SIAC Tribunal that, inter alia, the assets
on offer failed to include the Lao Bao Slot Club and the Savannakhet Ferry
Terminal Slot Club. Moreover, contrary to Section 6 of the Settlement, the draft of
the New PDA to be executed by the eventual purchaser contained less favourable
terms than the 2007 PDA between Laos and Sanum. These departures were not
contemplated by the Settlement, and according to the Claimants significantly
reduced the potential sale price. However, the SIAC Tribunal declined to intervene
with the Government’s proposed course of action. In its view, any actionable

damages suffered by the Claimants could be satisfied by financial compensation.

xiii. | The Government’s Failed Auction Process
77. In March 2016, six prospective buyers were approved by the Government to bid on
Savan Vegas, including the eventual purchaser, Macau Legend Development Ltd.
(“Macau Legend”).
78. At the end of March, the six approved bidders were given access to relevant
financial and other data, which included the relevant Savan Vegas financial
statements.** In addition, some of the bidders, including Macau Legend, met

privately with Government representatives.

3 See SIAC Tribunal Award, 29 June 2017, para. 129 (Email exchange between Steve Croxton and Kelly
Gass, 17-29 March 2016 (when asked when the financial information would be provided, Ms. Gass responds
on the same day that they “will be sending out the instructions for accessing the data room Wednesday or
Thursday USA time.”)).

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 306 of 457

79. In its discussions with Government representatives, Macau Legend switched the
focus somewhat from the Savan Vegas Casino to a proposed USD $300 million
development for the 300-hectare land parcel adjacent to the Casino property
(known as “Site A”). The Site A development was linked by Macau Legend to the
purchase of the Casino.** The Claimants argue that the proposed development of
Site A, with facilities in competition with the Casino, further diluted the market
value of the Casino itself.

80. Macau Legend offered to purchase Savan Vegas for US $40 million, provided the
auction was cancelled and Macau Legend was given development rights in Site A.*>

81. The SIAC Tribunal accepted the Government’s evidence that as the “auction”
process moved forward, and some potential bidders pulled out, the Government
became legitimately alarmed that in the end Macau Legend would be the only
bidder at the auction and in consequence be in a position to offer a low bid. The
Prime Minister met with some of his Ministers and decided that Laos would accept
Macau Legend’s offer to cancel the auction, and close the deal with Macau Legend,
provided the sale price was increased from US $40 million to US $42 million.*°

82. On6 May 2016, Macau Legend accepted the counter-offer,>” and, on the same day,

the Government advised the SIAC Tribunal that it had entered into an agreement

with Macau Legend for the sale of Savan Vegas. Macau Legend and Laos executed

the New PDA and other relevant documentation on or about 13 May 2016.°8

xiv. The Macau Legend Flat Tax Agreement

83. The Government and Macau Legend subsequently concluded a flat tax agreement,
pursuant to which Macau Legend would pay a flat tax of US $10 million annually
for three years following the closing of the purchase, which would then increase
somewhat thereafter, for two extensions of one year each.’ As part of the deal,
Macau Legend also committed to invest in certain infrastructure projects in Laos.

84. While the Claimants note the difference between the flat tax agreed to with Macau
Legend, and the 28% ad valorem tax recommended by Mr. Va, they also contend
that the “tax” payments of US $10 million per year in fact amounted in significant
part to a deferred purchase price, which would go entirely to the Government
instead of the 80/20 split agreed to in the Settlement.

85. Meanwhile, as the sale to Macau Legend was being finalized, ST Vegas Enterprise
Ltd. (“ST Group”), a Lao company that had previously partnered with Sanum (and
had initially invested in the Casino and slot clubs), communicated to the
Government its interest in purchasing Savan Vegas. On 15 August 2016, the ST
Group offered “to buy our properties and business of Savan Vegas and Casino, Ltd

... with the proposed price of US $100,000,000 (one hundred million dollars), with

possession of Savan Vegas.

xy. The Award of the SIAC Tribunal Dated 29 June 2017

87. As explained above, one of the difficulties created by the framing of the Settlement
is the allocation of overlapping jurisdiction in some respects between this Tribunal
and the SIAC Tribunal. The Government contends that its victory at SIAC in the
Award of 29 June 2017 puts an end to the treaty proceedings by virtue of the New
York law doctrines of res judicata and issue preclusion.

88. The majority decision of the SIAC Tribunal was rendered by Judge Rosemary
Barkett (Presiding Arbitrator) and Mr. Laurence Craig. An opinion dissenting in
part was delivered by Ms. Carolyn Lamm.

89. The majority decision of the SIAC Tribunal concluded that the Government had
not only affirmed the Settlement despite the conduct of the Claimants, but had
actually implemented the Settlement:

(a) The Government “did not breach its obligations under the Deed [of
Settlement]” [Award, para. 328(f)];
(b) “The Tribunal determines that both Parties are entitled to a share of the

purchase price of Savan Vegas, ... as defined by the Asset Purchase

Agreement between Laos and Macau Legend, proportionate to their
ownership interest in Savan Vegas” [Award, para. 312(d)];

(c) “Laos is entitled to receive 20% of the purchase price of US
$15,341,000 which equals US $3,068,200 and Sanum is entitled to
receive the remaining 80% which equals US $12,272,800” [Award,
para. 317];

(d) In respect of the sale process, “[LHNV and Sanum] were in material
breach of their obligations under Paragraph 9 of the Deed and Annex E
of the Deed concerning payment to and cooperation with RMC”
[Award, para. 328(d)];

(e) “[LHNV and Sanum] materially breached their obligations under
Paragraph 10 of the Deed concerning their obligation to take steps to
sell Savan Vegas” [Award, para. 328(c)];

(f) The SIAC Tribunal noted that “[LHNV and Sanum] also argue that the
Deed’s requirement that the tax be ‘flat’ means that the tax should be a
fixed, unchanging, periodic amount, not a fixed tax rate.” However,
[the SIAC Tribunal comments] “the Deed does not define ‘flat tax’, and
when Mr. Va, a qualified professional knowledgeable about the taxation
of casinos, was asked to determine a ‘flat tax’, he interpreted this term
to mean a tax with a flat rate ... a flat tax is a tax that applies a constant
marginal rate on income, the Majority does not find Mr. Va’s
interpretation to be an unreasonable one” [Award, para. 287];

(g) “[LHNV and Sanum] materially breached their obligations under
Paragraph 7 of the Deed concerning their obligation to cause Savan
Vegas to pay taxes to Laos as of 1 July 2014” [Award, para. 328(b)];

(h) “We conclude that [LHNV and Sanum] have not proven their claim with
respect to the exclusion of the Slot Clubs from the sale of Savan Vegas”
[Award, para. 228];

“The Deed itself acknowledges that [the Government’s] obligation to
terminate ‘the current criminal investigations against Sanum/Savan
Vegas and its management’ only exists ‘provided that the terms and
conditions agreed herein are duly and fully implemented by [LHNV and
Sanum] [Award, para. 310];

G

“Evidence is undisputed that, for ten months, as delineated earlier in this
Award, ‘the terms and conditions’ agreed [in the Deed] were not ‘duly
and fully implemented’” [Award, para. 311];

(k) “... the Majority concludes that Claimant [the Government] did not
breach any obligation under these circumstances by failing to grant the
new buyer the right to extend the runway at Savannakhet” [Award, para.
239];

(

“Therefore, the Majority concludes that, based on the record [LHNV
and Sanum] failed to demonstrate that [the Government] did not
maximize the Sale proceeds of Savan Vegas” [Award, para. 295].

OUTLINE OF THE SUBMISSIONS OF THE PARTIES ON THE SECOND
MATERIAL BREACH APPLICATION

i. The Claimants’ Contentions in Support of the Second Material
Breach Application

The Claimants note that under New York law “material breach” means that “a party
has failed to substantially perform its obligations under the relevant contract or

62

provision. Therefore, the “Claimants need only show that the breach was

material in light of the performance, promised benefit and purpose of each of the
enumerated sections, not of the contract as a whole.”

The Claimants contend that each of the following breaches by the Government,
taken in isolation, is sufficient to revive the Treaty arbitration:

(a) The Government willfully breached Section 5 of the Settlement by
physically seizing and unilaterally operating Savan Vegas, by
expropriating the Casino's assets by decree and structuring the sale of
the Casino so as to deprive Claimant of the 80% value of the proceeds;

(b) The Government willfully breached Section 6 of the Settlement by
terminating the Savan Vegas PDA and publicizing a new and deficient
Project Development Agreement (“PDA”) as part of the auction
process. The PDA executed by the Government with Macau Legend
provided for fewer rights and more obligations than the original 2007
PDA with Sanum. These modifications made Savan Vegas less

valuable as a going concern;

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 312 of 457

(c) The value of the “Gaming Assets” was further reduced by failing to
include in the sale the Lao Bao Slot Club and the Savannakhet Ferry
Terminal Slot Club. The Claimants reject the Government’s contention
that it could not sell the “slot clubs” as the licenses were actually held
by the Claimants’ former Laotian partner, ST, because, the Claimants
contend, the Government was aware at the time of the Settlement of the
ownership structure of the slot clubs. The Government keeps a record
of the gaming licenses that it has issued. Despite this knowledge of ST’s
interest, the Government included the slot clubs in the definition of

gambling assets to be sold as contemplated by Section 6 of the

Settlement;®*

(d) The Government breached Sections 7 and 8 of the Settlement in respect
of the “new flat tax” by abandoning the mutually agreed procedure, and
imposing a tax which is not a flat tax but an ad valorem tax of 28% of

gross gambling revenues. The Claimants contend that under any

© The Government explains the “slot club” issue as follows:

What actually happened was that it was admitted that ST owned the land on which the slot clubs
were built, ST owned the buildings in which the slot clubs operated and ST owned the licences
issued by the government to operate the slot clubs. All Mr. Baldwin had was a contract which is
called, in the slot club industry, a participation agreement, which allows you to put your slot clubs
into somebody else’s property under their licence and you share the profits 60/40. That was the
only 60/40 right Mr. Baldwin had. It was to 60 per cent of the profits of operating the slot machines.
I wrote to them three times, and it’s listed in the SLAC Award. I wrote to them in July, August and
September, and each time I said to them, “We have discovered that ST owns the slot clubs”, and
even the participation agreement cannot be assigned — Sanum was the 60 per cent majority in the
participation agreement — the agreement expressly says it cannot be assigned unless ST agrees to
the assignment.

So we said to them, “The government has no objection to selling the slot clubs, delighted, but we
can’t sell them if the owner doesn’t agree. So please deal with ST and come up with a solution.” (3
July 2017, Hearing Transcript, p. 165.)

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 313 of 457

plausible scenario an ad valorem tax of 28% GGR depressed materially
the value of the Casino. According to the Claimants, the wrongful
purpose of setting an ad valorem tax was to confiscate value from the
Claimants and to reduce the Claimants’ share of the proceeds;

(e) The 28% ad valorem tax is discriminatory as it has only been applied to
Savan Vegas and not to other casinos in Laos. Furthermore, the
Claimants point to the lump sum payments of US $10 million per year
by Macau Legend for the first three years as proof of what was always
understood by both the Government and the Claimants to constitute a
“flat tax.” The breach of the promise of a flat tax was willful and
altogether destroyed a material driver of the value of the gambling
assets. The ad valorem tax was non-flat and unreasonably high and
thereby materially depressed the purchase price;

(

oS

Furthermore, the Government misused the ad valorem tax to justify
seizing a substantial part of the Claimants’ share of the purchase price
paid by Macau Legend for payment of supposed back taxes;

(g) The Government accepted a lower price for the sale of the Casino in
exchange for Macau Legend's agreement to pay post-purchase inflated
flat-tax payments;

(h) The Government also breached Section 15 of the Settlement by

depositing all of the sale proceeds in its own bank accounts or those of

its own wholly-owned entity Savan Lao rather than in a joint escrow

account. It then wrongfully diverted US $26,659,000 million of the $42

@

million purchase price to satisfy the Claimants’ alleged tax liability
which was not lawfully imposed. According to the Claimant, “the fact
that Respondent deposited the remaining US $15,341,000 in a sole party
escrow account almost four months after the transaction closed, in an
effort to make a show of compliance [with the Settlement], does not
change the fact that Laos failed to comply with the Deed's requirement
that all proceeds be deposited directly by the buyer into a joint escrow
account established by both Parties’;

The Government breached Section 25 of the Settlement by falsely
representing to prospective purchasers that expansion of the
Savannakhet Airport runway was not feasible. While the Government
suggested the possibility of development of a new airport at an
alternative location, such an “alternative” proposal does not remedy the
breach. Construction of a new airport will take longer and cost more
than extending the existing Airport at Savannakhet, and, under New
York law, a material breach in respect of a unique asset cannot be cured
by substituting a different asset. Based on their experts' calculations, the
Claimants contend that the failure to include the airport right in the sale
resulted in the material loss of nearly a fifth of the Casino's value;

The Government breached Section 22 of the Settlement in respect of
Thakhaek development site. The Claimants paid the US $500,000
deposit required by Section 22 and they say they attempted to negotiate

in good faith development proposals for the 90 hectares site but were

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 315 of 457

stonewalled by the Government and have received none of the benefit
which was intended and expected. The Government refused to
negotiate the Thakhaek Agreements in good faith and in particular:

(a) refused to include the most valuable 16 hectares of the site
on the basis that it was private property, notwithstanding that the
16 hectares were included on the map attached to the MOU, in
which the Government had implicitly committed itself to pay
compensation to the private owners;

(b) rejected without explanation the Claimants’ proposal for an
alternative concession arrangement;

(c) based on the valuation of their expert, the Claimants claim
that the opportunity to develop the Thakhaek concession was
worth as much as US$ 10.52 million;

(k) The Government materially breached Sections 23 and 27 of the Deed
by commencing and continuing to pursue criminal investigations in US
Federal Courts under 28 USC 1782, invoking the suspended allegations
of bribery and attempted corruption. The Government’s pursuit of those
criminal investigations entitles the Claimant “to revive arbitration
proceedings on that basis, in addition to the other material breaches

described above.”®

ii. The Government Defences to the Second Material Breach
Application

93. The Government points out that the Claimants’ arguments and contentions in this
Application rest on the same basis and duplicate the legal claims decided against
the Claimants by the SIAC Tribunal on 29 June 2017. Accordingly, under New
York law, the principles of res judicata and issue preclusion apply to bar the
application.

94. The Government emphasizes that in order to revive a pre-settlement claim under
the Settlement, interpreted in accordance with New York law, “the breach must be

’”67 of the entire contract.

material, destroying the ‘root of the bargain
95. The Tribunal has already determined that Section 32 requires a determination “on
both the existence of the breach and its materiality.”* The Government says the
Claimants agreed at SIAC and in the treaty proceedings that the “root of the
bargain” is to sell the Casino “on a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds.”® The
SIAC Tribunal concluded that the Casino was in fact sold for maximum value
within the meaning of Section 13 (which is not a section listed in Section 32 and
therefore not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal). The breaches alleged against
the Government under Sections 5-8 — even if established — would by definition not
be material because the Claimants did receive the essence of their bargain, namely

the sale of the Casino “on a basis that will maximize Sale proceeds.”

6 Counter-Memorial, para. 11. Preclusion is “plainly applicable here because all the facts and legal issues
that serve as the basis of Sanum’s claims in these proceedings were fully pled before, and are soon to be
adjudicated by, the SIAC Tribunal.”

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 317 of 457

96. Insofar as the Claimants argue that revival under Section 32 is equivalent to the
equitable remedy of rescission, the Government points out that entitlement to an
equitable remedy requires clean hands. The Claimants and their principals do not
have “clean hands.” They have committed repeated acts of fraud and bribery. Even
at the date of the Settlement, Mr. Baldwin had no intention of selling the Savan
Vegas Casino regardless of the price, according to the Government:

(a) First, Tak Chun, the possible buyer touted by Mr. Baldwin, at the time
of the Settlement, was not an interested buyer. “Sanum concocted this
false narrative from the very beginning, during the settlement
negotiations, in order to keep control of the Casino. It is only because
Sanum said they had a buyer that it was allowed [by the Government]
to keep control for 10 months to complete the sale;””°

(b) Second, the First Material Breach Application was a bad faith effort to

pressure Laos to renegotiate the Settlement. The strategem failed but
“the Decision on the Merits exposed Sanum’s bad faith. The LHNV
Tribunal held that the Government did not materially breach the Deed,
but also, and more significantly, that Sanum’s decision to unilaterally
stop performance and disregard the ‘cure’ provision was wholly
unjustified;””!

(c) Third, the Government says the Claimants put forward a fraudulent

buyer, Mr. Angus Noble, for Savan Vegas after the First Material

7 Counter-Memorial, para. 44.

Breach Application failed. “Claimants induced Mr. Noble to sign this

fraudulent document [the MOU], suborned knowingly false testimony

from Mr. Noble [by paying him] $10,000 per month for twenty-one (21)

months. Sanum submitted the fraudulent Noble MOU to the

Government, and more egregiously, to the SIAC Tribunal, all in an

effort to further Mr. Baldwin’s objective of maintaining control of the

casino;”7?

(d) “Rather than accept the Government’s numerous invitations to
participate in the transition of control, and to help the Government
complete the Deed’s purpose by selling the Casino, Mr. Baldwin chose
[to pursue] the Angus Nobel fraud. For Mr. Baldwin, the Noble fraud
‘was the right thing to do’ simply because he desperately ‘needed’ to
maintain control — that was the plan all along;”’’ (emphasis added)

(e) In late spring-early summer 2015, after the Settlement, Mr. Baldwin
hatched a scheme to bribe Government officials in an attempt to recover
control of Savan Vegas. The Government points to a draft consulting
agreement with an unemployed security guard, Mr. Ben Gersten,
disclosing (the Government says) the bribe that Mr. Baldwin was
willing to pay to Government officials to permit Sanum to recover

control of the Casino;

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 319 of 457

(f) The Government says bribery is part of Sanum's regular business model
as shown by numerous documented and uncontroverted acts of illegality
uncovered or proven after the Settlement was signed. It is now
established, the Government says, that Mr. Baldwin authorized a bribe
of $30,000 to obtain the original 2009 Savan Vegas Flat Tax
Agreement, and paid various other bribes to have the Thanaleng Slot
Club shut down, to tamper with witness in the court case with his former
partner, ST, and to obtain a lottery license in Cambodia.

97. The Government concludes: “In light of Sanum's egregious bad faith conduct in
connection with the Deed, the Tribunal should exercise its broad discretion under
New York law and the ICSID Rules to refuse to aid Sanum, the unclean litigant.””*

98. In the result, the Government claims the following relief: “the Tribunals must deny
the Second Material Breach Application and dismiss Sanum's claims in their

075

entirety. Both Tribunals must order “that these arbitration proceedings are

discontinued and terminated.””° Finally, the Government claims indemnification

under Section 28 of the Settlement.””

THRESHOLD ISSUES RAISED BY THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE
ENTIRETY OF THE CLAIMANTS’ APPLICATION

i. Res Judicata and the Alleged Impact of the SIAC Award Rendered
on 29 June 2017 on the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal

(a) The Government’s Position

The Government contends that the issues raised by Sanum in the Government-
initiated SIAC proceedings track the issues raised by the Claimants in the ICSID
and PCA proceedings. Thus, “LHNV literally cut and pasted their claims from the
Second Material Breach Application into their Second Amended SIAC
Counterclaims.””

The Claimants’ Second Material Breach Application contains 65 paragraphs, of
which 35 paragraphs present Sanum’s legal claims, and of these 35 paragraphs, 33
paragraphs are identical to the text of Sanum’s Counterclaims before the SIAC
Tribunal.”

Res judicata and collateral estoppel are plainly applicable here because all the facts
and legal issues that serve as the basis of Sanum’s claims in these proceedings were
fully pleaded before, and were adjudicated by, the SIAC Tribunal.*° The
Government cites in support of its position, inter alia, the decision of the New York

Court of Appeals for the proposition that:

[I]n general the doctrines of claim preclusion and issue preclusion
between the same parties (more familiarly referred to as res

judicata or direct estoppel) apply as well to awards in arbitration
as they do to adjudications in judicial proceedings.*!

(b) The Claimants’ Position
102. The Claimants deny that the SIAC Award precludes the Tribunal from reviving the
Treaty arbitration under Section 32 of the Settlement. First, the SIAC Tribunal had
no jurisdiction to consider the only relief claimed before this Tribunal, namely
whether the Claimants are entitled to revive the Treaty arbitration under Section 32
of the Settlement. Second, New York procedure does not govern these proceedings.
Res judicata and issue preclusion questions are to be governed by international law.
103. In any event, the Government has not established the prerequisites for res judicata
or issue preclusion for the following reasons: first, the claims do not meet the triple
identity test applied by international tribunals, (identity of parties, causes of action
and relief);8* second, under New York law, “claim preclusion could be invoked
only to bar a claim that had been or could have been brought in the prior

99,83

proceeding third, [t]here are no clear rules under international law as to how,

when and whether the doctrine of issue preclusion is to be applied as between two

arbitrations”;* and fourth, under New York law, “collateral estoppel [issue

international law as the law applicable to these questions

  

 

166 ... Under international law, three conditions need to be fulfilled for a decision to have binding
effect in later proceedings: namely, that in both instances, the object of the claim, the cause of
action, and the parties are identical.

preclusion] applies only if the issue in the two forums is identical, there was a full

and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first forum, and the issue was actually

decided and necessary to the outcome in the first forum.”*>

104. The Government’s only reference to an “international” case is Grynberg and RSM
v. Grenada® which was not a case (as here) where the two tribunals were

constituted under the same instrument, with one tribunal assigned jurisdiction over

certain issues, and the other tribunal assigned jurisdiction over certain other issues.

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
105. The preclusion issue must be approached from an international law perspective.*”
The Tribunal was not “constituted” by the Settlement. It was constituted under,
and derives its jurisdiction from, international treaties. The Treaty hearings were
suspended (perhaps permanently) by the Settlement, but the Tribunal continues to
exist “in suspense” as a Treaty Tribunal. A finding of a material breach of one of
the sections listed in Section 32 is a condition precedent, of course, to any revival
of the Treaty arbitration, but the fact that the parties have stipulated that “(t)his

Deed shall be governed by and construed solely in accordance with the laws of New

2.4.1, 4.6.18.

87 CLA-293, Gary Born, International Commercial Arbitration, (Second Edition) (Kluwer 2014), para. 3775:
Nonetheless, as discussed above, there are substantial grounds for doubting that national preclusion
rules are appropriate in international arbitration, particularly with regard to the preclusive effects of
arbitral awards. For the reasons already detailed, the appropriate choice-of-law treatment of the
preclusive effect of awards is to develop and apply uniform international standards of preclusion
derived from the New York Convention.

 

Mr. Born’s point was that international tribunals should not resort to national law because it could often lead
to overly technical applications of preclusion. (See Hearing Transcript, R-047, 18 October 2016, p. 23).

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 323 of 457

York” does not transform the Treaty Tribunal into a domestic New York
commercial arbitration tribunal.

106. As acknowledged by counsel for the Government at an earlier stage in these
proceedings, the contractual basis of arbitration jurisdiction distinguishes

international arbitrations from a court system established under a state constitution:

Mr. D. Branson: ... there’s a hierarchy, in our court system. That
doesn’t exist in international arbitration. So, technically, while
you must, under New York law, if you’re a court in New York,
apply the doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel, you’re
not required to apply them. We would have to ask you to apply
them as a matter of wisdom and good sense.**

 

107. While the Government took a more aggressive position on this point at the merits
hearing in Singapore, in the Tribunal’s view, Mr. Branson’ earlier statement is the
correct analysis.

108. Even in matters governed by U.S. domestic law, including the law of New York, it
is for the parties to determine by contract their chosen “scheme of remedies.” Party
autonomy in arbitration in this respect is affirmed by the jurisprudence cited in the

American Restatement of Law (Judgments):

Assuming that the arbitration procedure has the elements of
validity and has become final, it should be accorded claim
preclusive effect unless a scheme of remedies requires that it
be denied such effect.*° (emphasis added)

109. In arbitral matters, the contract governs. The Settlement confers two distinct and

separate arbitral mandates without creating any preclusive hierarchy in their

authority to decide issues within their respective spheres. The Settlement creates
no rule of paramountcy between the SIAC Tribunal and this Treaty Tribunal. The
application in these circumstances of res judicata or issue preclusion would be
contrary to the freedom of contract exercised by the parties.

Acceptance of the Government’s position would set up the proverbial “race to the
Courthouse.” If the Claimants could get a revival from the Tribunal before the
Government could get an award in its favour from SIAC, then the Claimants would
prevail. If SIAC issued a favourable award first, the Government would prevail.
The scheme of overlapping jurisdiction created by the Settlement does create some
complexities, but there is nothing in the Settlement to suggest that the parties
intended the complexities to be solved by a “race to the Courthouse.”

The SIAC Tribunal itself acknowledged the existence of separate mandates to be
exercised by the SIAC Tribunal and this Tribunal to address different causes of

action and different remedial relief:

Given the contents of the prior decision of the LHNV BIT
Tribunal, the Second Material Breach application, and
Respondents’ Amended Response and Counterclaims, we cannot
conclude, based on the record before us, that there is a substantial
overlap of the issues and requested relief before the LHNV BIT
Tribunal and the issues and requested relief remaining before this
Tribunal.” (emphasis added)

 

112. The Tribunal has no authority to abdicate in favour of a SIAC Tribunal its Section

32 mandate to revive or not to revive the Treaty arbitration.

° €-962, SIAC Tribunal’ s Order on Interim Measures and Requests to Stay Proceedings, 22 July 2016, para.

5.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 325 of 457

113. That having been said, it is equally the duty of the Tribunal to confine itself to the
sections listed in Section 32 and not to second guess the SIAC Tribunal in respect
of sections of the Settlement not listed in Section 32.

114. Thus, for example, Section 9 of the Settlement describes the procedure for the
determination of the “new flat tax.” The SIAC Tribunal concluded that the process
adopted by the Government did not violate Section 9. The Claimants contend that
Section 9 is incorporated by reference into Section 8, but counsel for the

Government correctly points out the fallacy of this position:

If [the Claimants] wanted to make section 9 or the way that the
Flat Tax Committee was formed or the way it operated or the way
they made a fair and reasonable tax, then get section 9 into section
32.

We didn’t agree to put section 9 in section 32. You can’t
incorporate by reference, when you have two clauses next to each
other, one of them is in section 32, the next one is not, and then
say, “Oh, this one really is in section 32 because it’s incorporated
in section 8.”"!

115. Any views of the Tribunal about the Government’s compliance with the process
set out in Section 9 are not relevant because Section 9 is not listed in Section 32.
On the other hand, the Tribunal is required to determine for the sole purpose of
revival whether the outcome of the Section 9 process was a “new flat tax” within
the meaning of Section 8. The differing mandates under Sections 32 and 42 of the

Settlement are not to be confused (and the legitimate expectation of the Claimants

thereby negated) by doctrines of res judicata and issue estoppel.

The Tribunal is thus limited in its jurisdiction to a sub-set of sections of the
Settlement, namely those listed in Section 32. The SIAC Tribunals have no such
limitation, either in terms of the elements of the Settlement (except Section 32)
subject to their consideration, or in the type of relief (including financial
compensation) which they may grant except for the “carve out” from SIAC
jurisdiction in respect of revival of the Treaty arbitration. Therefore, the “carve
out” in favour of this Tribunal must be respected.
The Government’s objection based on res judicata and issue preclusion is rejected.
ii. Did the Claimants Forfeit Any Right to Government Performance
Under the Settlement by Their Own Non-Performance?
The Tribunal agrees with the Government that during the pendency of the First
Material Breach Application, and in particular in the period beyond the 45 day cure
period, the Claimants repeatedly violated important obligations under the
Settlement, including through their refusal to proceed with the establishment of a
Flat Tax Committee, to cooperate with RMC’s monitoring of Casino matters
pending the sale of the Casino, or to cooperate in “the orderly exchange of control”
of the unsold Casino on 15 April 2015.
The issue is whether these breaches of the Settlement preclude the relief sought by

the Claimants in their Second Material Breach Application.

(a) The Government’s Position
The Government contends that the Claimants forfeited by their repudiation of their
obligations under the Settlement any procedural rights under the Settlement to

participate in the sale of the Gaming Assets. Despite provocation and disruption

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 327 of 457

by the Claimants, the Government proceeded prudently by subjecting the sale
process to the supervision of the SIAC Tribunal, which endorsed (where it did not
actually direct) the steps taken by the Government to sell the Gaming Assets. Any
departures from the process set out in the Settlement were made under SIAC

supervision in order to salvage a sale “that maximized proceeds.”

(b) The Claimants’ Position

121.

The Claimants say that their obligations under the Settlement were suspended until
the First Material Breach Application was decided on 10 June 2015. At that point,
the Government had a choice: treat the Settlement as terminated by reason of
material breaches by the Claimants, or, notwithstanding such breaches, affirm and
carry on with implementation of the Settlement. The Government, having elected
to continue to take the benefit of the Settlement by so declaring and proceeding
with the sale of the Gaming Assets as it did, was thereby obligated to accept the
burden of the Claimants’ rights and privileges.°? As pointed out by the Claimants,
the Government explicitly affirmed its intention to take the benefits under the

Settlement:

%2 See Claimants’ Opening, 3 July 2017, citing CLA-367, V.S. Intl’l v. Boyden World Corp., 862 F. Supp.
1188 (S.D.N.Y. 1994):
When one party to a contract materially breaches the contract during the course of a continuing
performance, the non-breaching party “has a choice presented to him of continuing the contract or
of refusing to go on.” Id. (quoting Emigrant Industr. Savs. Bank v. Willow Builders, Inc.,290 N.Y.
133, 145, 48 N.E.2d 293, 299 (1943)). When the “injured party chooses to go on, he loses his right
to terminate the contract because of the default.” Apex Pool Equip., 419 F.2d at 562. In short,
‘[o]nce the non-breaching party elects to continue the contract, he may not at a later time renounce
his election and seek to terminate based on the prior breach.”

 

Accordingly, based on the findings of fact set forth above, this Court finds that defendant is not
liable to plaintiffs for breach of contract because plaintiffs elected to affirm the contract by
continuing to receive benefits thereunder.

(iii) in the Government’s Amended SIAC Notice of Arbitration dated 3 June 2015
at para. 79.
122. Even after the sale of the Casino to Macau Legend on 31 August 2016, the
Government repeatedly affirmed its election before the SIAC Tribunal:
(i) 14 October 2016: “The Government is entitled to specific performance
under Section 16 of the Deed;””
(ii) 23 December 2016: “The Government is entitled to both specific
performance and money damages under the Deed;”**
(iii) 22 January 2017: “The Government fully performed its duties and
therefore is entitled to specific performance and damages.”°°
123. The Government derived substantial benefits from its affirmation of the
Settlement:
(a) It received US $15,341,000 out of the sale proceeds, as well as
unfettered access to the Casino’s revenues for over a year;
(b) It recovered US $26,659,000 in taxes from the period before the sale on

the basis of an ad valorem tax on 28% of gross gaming revenue;

(c) It received US $500,000 as payment to restart the Thakhaek
negotiations which led nowhere;

(d) In the meantime, the Government has relied on the Section 27 release
and suspension of the Treaty arbitration to avoid litigating the alleged
treaty violations.

124. Citing New York jurisprudence,” the Claimants contend that “it is black-letter law
that when one party to a contract materially breaches it, the non-breaching party
has two options: it can terminate the agreement and sue for total breach, or it can
continue the contract and sue for partial breach. There is, however, no third option
allowing the party claiming a breach to invoke ‘self-help’ and only perform those

obligations it wishes to perform.”

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
125. The Settlement was a compromise under which the Claimants gave up (on
conditions) their claim to treaty compensation (the merits and quantum of which
were never determined) in exchange for a process for the sale of the Gaming Assets
that included substantial rights of participation by the Claimants.
126. While the Tribunal ultimately found the First Material Breach Application to be
without merit, the Government thereafter declined the renewed offers of

cooperation, but instead:

(a) assumed control of the Casino;

(b) unilaterally carried out preparation for its sale;

(c) implemented a procedure to determine the applicable tax;

(d) adopted a 28% ad valorem tax;

(e) sold the Casino to Macau Legend in a package that included “Site A” to
which the Casino licence would be transferred.

127. The Government clearly affirmed and relied on the terms of the Settlement to sell
the Gaming Assets and to rid Laos of the Claimants and their managers and
principals. As emphatically stated by counsel for the Government to counsel for
the Claimants in an email of 30 May 2015 rejecting Sanum’s belated proposal to

participate in the Flat Tax Committee:

The Government rejects your assumptions and proposals.

The Government has stated its position on the overall issues in its
Response dated May 29, 2015, filed with the SIAC Tribunal.

The Government has no interest in continuing any dealings with
the criminals you represent.”” (emphasis added)

128. By affirming the Settlement on numerous occasions up to and including the hearing
on 3 and 4 July 2017, the Government obliged itself to accept the burden as well as
the benefit of its terms, however distasteful it may have found the obligation to
continue to deal with the officers and principals of the Claimants. As expressed by

the dissenting arbitrator in the SIAC Award of 29 June 2017 at paragraphs 5 and 6:

Under New York law, a party may not accept the benefits of a
contract while refusing to accept the burdens.

97 C-981, Email from David Branson to Christopher Tahbaz, 30 May 2015.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 331 of 457

If there is a material breach, the non-breaching party must choose
between two remedies: to terminate the contract or to continue it.
Under New York’s doctrine of election of remedies there is not a
“third option” allowing a party claiming breach to invoke self-help
and only perform those obligations which it wishes to perform.

129. Indeed, in the course of the hearing of 3 July 2017, counsel for the Government

acknowledged a more nuanced position:

So the court says [in ESPN Inc. v. Office of the Comm’r of
Baseball°*] baseball has two choices: it can terminate the parties’
contract and claim damages for total breach, or it can continue the
contract and sue for partial breach. That’s the law of New York.

The point is that you have to look at the type of contract the parties
are engaged in to determine what the options are when you are
confronted with a breach. What it usually means is you are
confronted with a breach, you obviously, if it’s a material breach,
have the right to terminate the contract and sue for damages for
the whole contract, but there are times when that’s not in the
interests of the party on the other side ... so [it] can continue
performance because you get the benefit of the future
performance, but you can sue for partial damages that have
occurred.*” (emphasis added)

130. The Government’s potential claim for “partial damages” is not before the Tribunal.

131. The Tribunal intends no disrespect to the majority decision of the SIAC Tribunal.
The Tribunal is concerned only with the entitlement (if any) of the Claimants to
rely on Section 32 of the Settlement. This was not an issue that was dealt with or
could be dealt with by the SIAC Tribunal.

132. Accordingly, the Government erred in treating the Claimants as having forfeited

important ongoing rights to renewed participation in the sale of the Gaming Assets.

iii, Are the Claimants Barred from Claiming the Benefit of Section 32
Because They Did Not Perform Their Contractual Obligations and
New York Law Provides That a Party in Default Cannot Call on the

Other Contracting Party for Enforcement?

(a) The Government’s Position
133. The Claimants are barred from Section 32 relief because of their failure to perform
their own obligations: (i) to establish and complete the work of the Flat Tax
Committee; (ii) to accept RMC as the qualified gaming monitor; (iii) to pay taxes
to the Government; (iv) to sell the Gaming Assets; and (v) to cooperate in the
transition of control to the Government after failing to sell the Gaming Assets
within ten months. !°

134. Such failures bar the Application under the two interrelated principles that (a) “one
who breaches a contract may not seek to enforce other provisions of that contract
to his or her benefit” and (b) “in order to seek relief under the Deed, Sanum must

establish its own performance of its obligations, which it cannot.” !®!

(b) The Claimants’ Position
135. New York law establishes no such principle applicable to a commercial contract
where (as here) both parties allege multiple breaches by the other. It is common in
litigation in New York and elsewhere for both contracting parties to point a finger
at the other as contract breakers. Both parties may succeed in their claims in some

respects and lose in other respects.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 333 of 457

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling

136. The Government’s argument assumes the point in issue, namely whether it is the
Claimants or the Government (or both, or neither) that is in breach of the
Settlement.

137. In this particular case, the Government relies principally on the Claimants’ conduct
prior to the dismissal by the ICSID Panel of the First Material Breach Application
on 10 June 2015.

138. However, since at least 8 May 2015,'°? the Claimants have professed a desire to
participate in the Flat Tax Committee and preparations for the sale of the Casino
but were rebuffed by the Government, which, while affirming its reliance on the
Settlement, refused to have “any dealings with the criminals you represent.”!>

139. The Government clearly regarded as made in bad faith the Claimants’ late
flowering offer to cooperate in the sales process which they had for months declared

to be “suspended.”! Apart from everything else, the Government says the

12 C_1045, Respondent’s Amended Provisional Measures Application, SIAC, 8 May 2015, para. 36:
Second, instead of waiting for the Flat Tax Committee to establish the proper tax — the Respondents
are prepared to constitute that Committee immediately, to preserve their contractual rights under
Sections 8 and 9 of the Settlement in the event that the Material Breach Application is denied.

13 C981, Email from D. Branson to C. Tahbaz, 30 May 2015.

104 The Government's interpretation of the 8 May 2015 “offer” differs from that of the Claimants:
What their position was, was not that we want to admit that you are in proper control of the casino
and then let’s work together to set a flat tax so you can sell it. No. Their positions was: “We're
entitled to control of the casino for ten more months because the period wa: vended while we
were having our material breach application, and if you give us the casino back for ten more months,
then we'll set up a Flat Tax Committee because we're going to sell the casino.”

  

That wasn’t acceptable to the government. Ten months meant ten months. As the SIAC tribunal
said, if their version of the suspension provision was correct, they could just keep filing material
breach applications and we would never see the sale of the casino. That was another feature to what
was going on at that time.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 334 of 457

140.

141.

142.

Claimants took the position that the end of the “suspension” re-started the clock,
giving the Claimants a further 10 months of time of the Casino starting from the
date of the end of the suspension. But the Claimants’ good or bad faith was never
put to the test. They were simply shut out of the sales process as “criminals.”
(emphasis added)
In the circumstances, it is not open to the Government to simultaneously affirm and
rely on the Settlement while attempting to ban the Claimants from seeking a remedy
on the basis of the Claimants’ conduct (or misconduct) that predated the
Government’s affirmations that continued to and included the Singapore hearing
on 3 and 4 July 2017.

iv. Are the Claimants Barred from Relief Under Section 32 Because

They Do Not Have “Clean Hands”?
(a) The Government’s Position

The Government contends that the Tribunal should not revive the Treaty arbitration
at the request of “criminals” who are “unclean litigants.”
The Government contends that the Claimants’ unclean hands are a complete bar to
the Second Material Breach Application.'°° Each instance of misconduct described

by the Government in its Counter-Memorial “meets the legal requirements for

105

We took control in April. I asked Mr. Baldwin in the proceeding in Paris, I said, “Mr. Baldwin, did

you ever intend to allow the government to sell the casino?” It’s on page 1120 of the transcript of

the fourth day.

Well, his answer was, “No, I never intended to allow the government to sell the casino.” And

everything he did, everything he did between April and when we sold the casino was to try and

prevent the government from selling the casino. (Hearing Transcript, 3 July 2017, pp. 182-183)
Rejoinder, paras. 70-75.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 335 of 457

unclean hands — the conduct (1) relates to the Deed, (2) was committed in bad faith;

and (3) injured the Government.” !°°

143. The Government argues that the remedy sought by the Claimants, namely revival
of the Treaty arbitration, is in substance an equitable remedy for rescission of the
Settlement, and is therefore barred by unclean hands. The fact that the parties have

a contract “does not convert rescission into a remedy at law.”!°7 It notes that the

Claimants have pleaded rescission before SIAC as an alternative ground for relief.

(b) The Claimants’ Position

144. The Claimants contend that the Government’s unclean hands defense is irrelevant
to the issues before the Tribunal and unsupported by the evidence. Under New
York law, a “clean hands” defense bars only equitable relief!°* and the Claimants

seek no such equitable relief, only a procedural order explicitly authorized by

Section 32 of the Settlement as a matter of contract law not equity. The Claimants

point out that the Government “does not even attempt to explain how a procedural

determination, allowing the BIT arbitrations to resume on the merits in accordance
with a contractual termination provision, could constitute equitable relief.” !°

145. Moreover, the Claimants argue, the “clean hands” argument invites the Tribunal to

examine the truth of the Government’s “allegations of fraud and bribery” but such

106 Thid, para. 70.

‘01 Tid, para. 71.

108 CLA-325, Aetna Cas. And Sur. Co. v. Aniero Concrete Co., Inc.., 404 F.3d 566 (2d. Cir. 2005):
“Unclean hands is an equitable defense to equitable claims. Because the [claimant] seeks damages
in an action at law, [respondent] cannot avail itself of unclean hands as a defense.”

See also CLA-338, Hasbro Bradly v. Coopers & Lybrand, N.Y.S.2d 461 (N.Y. App. Div. 1987).

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 336 of 457

allegations fall outside the Tribunal’s Section 32 jurisdiction. To the extent (if any)
that the same allegations are at issue in the underlying Treaty arbitration, the
Tribunal may consider them only after granting the Section 32 applications, and
may do so only on the frozen record agreed at the time of the Settlement as specified

in Sections 33 and 34 of the Deed.”!!°

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling

146. The Tribunal considers that the claim under Section 32 of the Settlement is not a
claim for equitable relief. The Claimants seek to enforce a contractual right. They
do so as a matter of legal entitlement (Section 32 uses the word “shall”). There is
no equitable discretion. Section 32 does not use “may” which would signal the
existence of a discretion, to which the Government might address arguments for
dismissal.

147. The Government argues that in effect the Claimants’ demand for revival is

equivalent to its demand at SIAC in rescission:

... because as to their counterclaims in SIAC and their claims
here, they’re identical. The only difference they say is, “We’re
asking for revival instead of rescission” — no, they are asking for
rescission which leads to revival.''!

148. The Tribunal is unable to agree. A revival of the Treaty arbitration would be
enforcement of Section 32, not rescission of the Settlement. Revival of the Treaty

arbitration would be on the terms set out in Sections 33 and 34 of the Settlement

110 Tbid., para. 70. The Claimants continue: “The Government “does not even attempt to connect [the
Claimants’ “alleged misconduct”] with the relief that the Claimants are seeking here or the Government's
breaches, as required to plead an unclean hands defense, nor does it attempt to assert that it was injured by
them.”, para. 84.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 337 of 457

governing the content of the record and the bar against “new claims or evidence ...
or additional relief.”

149. Accordingly, the Claimants do not seek rescission or other form of equitable relief
and under New York law, the enforcement of a legal contractual right, if otherwise
justified, is not conditional on “clean hands.” The defence based on unclean hands
cannot therefore bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

VI. THE GOVERNMENT’S ALLEGED MATERIAL BREACHES OF THE
SECTIONS LISTED IN SECTION 32 OF THE SETTLEMENT
i. Are Any of the Government’s Breaches “Material”?
150. In its Interim Ruling on Issues Arising Under the Deed of Settlement, the Tribunal

held that:!!?
... Section 32 gives the consent of the parties to the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal to decide whether there has been a breach and
whether the breach thus established is material.
(a) The Claimants’ Position

151.

The Claimants dispute the relevance of the Government's argument that a party may
rescind a contract only for a material breach of the contract as a whole. According
to the Claimants, New York law requires Section 32 to be enforced as written and
therefore, the Claimants are entitled to an order granting their Second Material
Breach Application for a material breach of any of the listed sections. In any case,
argue the Claimants, the Government's breaches deprived the Claimants of virtually
all the benefits agreed by the parties in the Settlement. The Claimants add: “Under

any reasonable view of the facts, these breaches are a material breach of the

"2 R-013, para. 70.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 338 of 457

152.

153.

113

Settlement as a whole, regardless of whether Laos sold the assets it decided to sell
on terms that maximized their sale price.”!!

Many of the listed Settlement provisions have nothing to do with maximizing the
sale price under Section 13: the Government has disregarded the civil and criminal
releases (Sections 23 and 27), breached the escrow provision (Section 15) that the
proceeds of the sale be deposited directly into a joint escrow account; formally
expropriated the Claimants’ assets in breach of Section 5, breached Section 22
respecting the Thakhaek concession, and Sections 7 and 8 on the imposition of
taxes. Section 32 of the Settlement gives Claimants the right to revive the
arbitration if any of these provisions has been materially breached irrespective of
whether Section 13 has been breached or the Settlement as a whole has been
materially breached.

The Claimants argue that the Government also materially breached Settlement
provisions designed to support the sale price separately from Section 13, such as
Sections 6, 7, 8 and 25.''* The Claimants explain that these terms were included
because “they would have a profound effect on the nature and value of the

concession that was being transferred to the buyer of the Gaming Assets.” The

Reply, para. 47.

‘4 The Claimants cite CLA-298, Hadden v. Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. Inc., 34 N.Y.2d 88, 96 (N.Y.

1974):

There is no simple test for determining whether substantial performance has been rendered and
several factors must be considered, including the ratio of the performance already rendered to that
unperformed, the quantitative character of the default, the degree to which the purpose behind the
contract has been frustrated, the willfulness of the default, and the extent to which the aggrieved
party has already received the substantial benefit of the promised performance. (See 3A Corbin,
Contracts, paras. 704-707, 6 Williston, Contracts, paras. 841-888 844 [3" ed.]).

15

assets sold by the Government materially differ from the “Gaming Assets” the
parties agreed to sell, and the proceeds of the sale were correspondingly reduced.
The Claimants point out that “if the Government were right that only a breach of
Section 13 could be material, Section 32 of the Deed would be entirely meaningless.
Section 32, as amended by the Side Letter, lists twelve separate sections — which
do not include Section 13 — that are capable of being materially breached. If the
Government were right that only Section 13 can be materially breached, then
Section 32 could never apply because Section 13 is not listed there. That is
obviously not what the parties intended when they negotiated Section 32, and it
cannot be what Section 32 means.”!!5

According to the Claimants, under New York law, Claimants are entitled “to rely
on the terms of the Deed of Settlement as agreed by the parties. Performance that
substantially departs from what the parties agreed is not substantial performance

and is by definition a material breach.”!!°

(b) The Government’s Position
The Government emphasizes that “to revive a pre-settlement claim under New
York law and the Deed, the breach must be material, destroying the ‘root of the
bargain.’””!!7

The Government contends that, under New York law, a party may rescind a contract

only for a material breach of the contract as a whole. In light of the facts that: (i)

160.

the SIAC Tribunal found that the Government successfully “maximized sale
proceeds” within the meaning of Section 13; and (ii) the Claimants agreed
throughout these proceedings that the essential purpose of the Settlement was to
“maximize” the sale proceeds, therefore none of the other alleged breaches, even if
established, can be considered “material” under New York law. The essential
benefit of the parties’ bargain as expressed in Section 13 has been satisfied. This
is not a matter that can be revisited by the Tribunal because Section 13 itself is not

listed in Section 32.

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling

The text of Section 32 of the Settlement governs. It provides for revival “in the
event that Laos is in material breach of Sections 5-8, 15, 21-23, 25, 27 or 28.”
Section 32 does not speak of material breach of the Deed. Accordingly, the
Government is correct that revival is justified only if the breach is material but the
text of Section 32 makes clear that materiality is decided disjunctively on a section
by section analysis of the provisions listed in Section 32 and not on the Settlement
as a whole.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that a breach of Section 13 cannot be a
condition precedent to revival under Section 32, because Section 32 sets out the
conditions for revival and Section 13 is not referenced in Section 32.

In determining materiality of a breach of a listed section, however, the Tribunal is
content to proceed on the basis of the formulation of “materiality” suggested by the

Government, namely that the breach of the section must “go to the root” of the

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 341 of 457

benefit promised by that section, and “defeat the object of the parties” in their
agreement on that provision.!!®
ii. Did the Government Imposition of a 28% Ad Valorem Tax Comply
with the Promise of a “New Flat Tax” in Section 8 of the Settlement?
(a) The Claimants’ Position

161.

An ad valorem tax is not a “flat tax.” The guarantee of a flat tax was an essential
feature of the Claimants’ plan to market the Casino. The inability to offer a flat
tax, and the consequent destruction of shareholder value by imposition of an ad
valorem tax went to the root of Section 8 and indeed to the value to the Claimants

of the Settlement as a whole.

(b) The Government’s Position
162. The Government adopts the position of the majority of the SIAC Tribunal in the 29

June 2017 Award as follows:

[LHNV and Sanum] also argue that the Deed’s requirement that
the tax be “flat” means that the tax should be a fixed, unchanging,
periodic amount, not a fixed tax rate. However, the Deed does not
define “flat tax” and when Mr. Va, a qualified professional
knowledgeable about the taxation of casinos, was asked to
determine a “flat tax”, he interpreted this term to mean a tax with
a flat rate ... a flat tax is a tax that applies a constant marginal rate
on income, the Majority does not find Mr. Va’s interpretation
to be an unreasonable one. (emphasis added)

‘8 The Government cites Frank Felix Associates, Ltd. v. Austin Drugs, Inc., 111 F.3d 284, 289 (2d Cir.
1997), RLA-012.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 342 of 457

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
163. Section 8 of the Settlement promised the Claimants a “new flat tax” to be
ascertained by following the procedure set out in Section 9. Section 9 is not listed

in Section 32. Section 8 provides as follows:

Laos and the Claimants agree that a new flat tax (“FT”) shall be
promptly established in accordance with the procedure
described in Section 9 below, and such FT shall be applied to the
Gaming Assets with retroactive effect dating back to 1 July 2014.
The FT shall apply throughout the fifty (50) year term of the PDA.
Such FT shall be escalated by five percent (5%) at the fifth (Sth)
anniversary of the Effective Date and by five percent (5%) on
every five (5) year anniversary thereafter throughout the term.
(emphasis added)

164. A distinction must be drawn between the outcome promised in Section 8 (“a new

flat tax”) and the procedure by which the outcome is achieved under “the

procedure described in Section 9 below.”'!”

165. Section 7 of the Settlement actually cross-references the lump sum flat tax, which

is “specifically indicated in Article 1 of the previously signed FTA attached as

119 Section 9 provides:

9. Laos shall appoint RMC Gaming Management LLC (“RMC’) not later than ten (10) days after
the Effective Date, on the terms and conditions attached hereto as Annex E. If RMC does not accept
the appointment within 4 days of the Effective Date, Laos shall appoint another agent to assist it in
the matter as described in Annex E. Within ten (10) days of the Effective Date, the Claimants
(collectively) shall nominate one person and Laos shall nominate one person (which may be an
employee of RMC) to be members of a Flat Tax Committee (the “FT Committee”). Within ten (10)
days after the Effective Date, the two persons nominated by the Claimants and Laos to the FT
Committee shall nominate a mutually acceptable third FT Committee member. If the two FT
Committee members fail to reach an agreement on such third FT Committee member within such
deadline, the third FT Committee member shall be appointed in the sole discretion of the President
of the Macau Society of Registered Accountants. Within forty-five (45) days of the Effective Date,
the duly composed, three-member FT Committee shall determine a new fair and reasonable FT
applicable to the Gaming Assets, taking into due consideration all relevant information submitted
to the FT Committee by the Claimants and Laos.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 343 of 457

Annex D hereto.” The “previously signed FTA” affords no basis for the imposition
of an ad valorem tax.

166. Sections 7!”° and 8 are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal whereas Section 9 is
not. Accordingly, the Claimants are bound to accept the view of the SIAC Tribunal
that the process followed by the Government in establishing a “new flat tax”
complied with Section 9. However, the Tribunal is required to form its independent
view as to whether the outcome, namely the resulting 28% ad valorem tax, comes
within the expression “new flat tax” which in Section 8 the Government and the
Claimants agreed “shall be promptly established.”

167. Under Section 7 of the Settlement, the Government “waived any and all taxes and
related interest and penalties due and payable by the Claimants and the Gaming
Assets up to 1 July 2014” at which point implementation of a “new flat tax” as
provided in Section 8 was expected to come into effect.

168. According to the Tribunal, an ad valorem tax is not a flat tax within the meaning of
Section 32 of the Settlement.

169. The Government argues, in effect, that the word “flat” refers to “rate”, but the word
“rate” nowhere appears in Section 8, where the word “flat” clearly modifies the

word “tax.”

20 Section 7 provid

 

Laos shall forgive and waive any and all taxes and related interest and penalties due and payable by
the Claimants and the Gaming Assets up to | July 2014 in respect of the Gaming Assets, provided,
however, that taxes shall be due and payable as from 1 July 2014 as provided in Section 8 below.
The taxes covered herein are all taxes and fees including but not limited to those that are specifically
indicated in Article | of the previously signed FTA attached as Annex D hereto.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 344 of 457

170. The “new” flat tax is to replace the “old” flat tax which was a “fixed unchanging,

171.

periodic amount.” The SIAC Tribunal suggested that there was no definition of flat
tax in Section 8. With respect, this ignores the word “new” which relates the
obligation back to the previous “old” lump sum flat tax. Mr. Va gave no weight (if
he was aware of it) to the “old” flat tax under the 1 September 2009 Flat Tax
Agreement between Sanum and the Government which required a “fixed
unchanging periodic” payment of US $745,000 per year for 5 years, with the
possibility of renewal.'?! Instead, Mr. Va was given a report by the Government’s
expert, Professor Nelson Rose, which advocated a tax based on percentage of
revenue. !”?

It is evident that Mr. Va did not focus his research on flat tax regimes but broadly
canvassed the taxation policy of different countries in the region in relation to

gambling businesses and their comparative advantages and disadvantages, the

Va, 15 May 2015, para. 5:

5. The Procedure: On or before May 26, 2015, the Government’s expert on gaming taxation,
BDO, will prepare and present to Mr. Va a report on gaming customs and practices in Asia with
respect to taxation of gaming operations. The report will provide data concerning casinos
throughout Asia including the two casinos now operating in Laos. The Government will also
present a report by Professor L. Nelson Rose, on the necessity of stating the flat tax as a
percentage of gaming revenue. Mr. Va will set the flat tax regime applicable to the Gaming Assets
during the life of the concession to be granted to the new buyer and operator of the Gaming Assets.
While Mr. Va may consider the BDO report and the Professor Rose report, he is equally free and
able to consider information from his own experience or if he so desires, his own research, it being
further understood that Mr. Va may consider the factual and financial characteristics of the Gaming
Operations and of other gaming facilities in Asia, the 50-year life of the concession and other factors
he deems relevant. Mr. Va may freely determine the basis for the flat tax, whether expressed
as a percentage of revenues, dollar amount or other measure, provided that the measure, once
established, will not be subject to revision during the life of the concession. Mr. Va may utilize
others for tance, but he retains the authority and responsibility to set the flat tax. (emphasis
added)

current size of Savan Vegas, the current market position of Laos in the Asian

gaming industry and the impact of the gaming policies of Thailand (Savan Vegas’

172.

The Government knew full well the difference between an ad valorem tax with a

flat (28%) rate and a “new flat tax” for a fixed lump sum annual amount (as had

been agreed to in 2009). The Government soon entered into an agreement dated 19

August 2016 for a lump sum flat tax, at the request of Macau Legend. The result

was described in the text of the Macau Legend Agreement as a “flat tax.”

Article 1: Savan Vegas and Casino, LTD
agrees to pay the government a Flat Tax
which specifically covers the Casino Business
and includes Excise tax, turn over tax, profit
tax, Dividend tax, and dividend which is
included in the Flat Tax (see “Dividend” of
below timetable) and is in an amount of
$745,000 (seven hundred forty five
thousand dollars) per year. The payment
shall be split into 4 payments, in the period of
3 months each. The Flat Tax shall be paid to
the Provincial Tax Department of
Savannakhet Province but the dividend
portion of the Flat Tax shall be paid to the
Ministry of Finance through State Enterprise

B. In the Letter of Record dated May 13,
2016, the Investor requested that the
Company pay a flat tax in connection with
or relating to the Concession Rights,
Concession Activities, the Project and Project
Management. The PDA provides that such
flat tax shall be paid pursuant to this Flat
Tax Agreement (this “Agreement”).

In consideration of the foregoing and the
mutual promises contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties agree as follows:

2. Amount. The flat tax shall be United
States Ten Million (US $10,000,000.00) per
year (the “Flat Tax’) in relation only to
Gaming Activities.

3. Payee. The Company shall pay the Flat
Tax to the Tax Department of the Ministry of
Finance.

4. Period of Application of Flat Tax.

While substitution of an ad valorem tax with a flat tax rate was in the view of the
SIAC majority “reasonable” for SIAC’s purposes, the majority did so by deferring
to Mr. Va’s “legal” opinion.

In the view of the Tribunal, however, the issue is not what Mr. Va regarded as
“reasonable” but whether what he recommended, and what the Government
accepted, could correctly be described as a “new flat tax” within the meaning of
Section 8. In the view of the Tribunal, a 28% ad valorem tax is non-compliant.
The question remains whether the 28% ad valorem tax is a material breach of
Section 8. In the view of the Tribunal, the breach is material. It is noted that every
other casino in Laos also pays a flat tax established as a lump sum annually.!?6

It is apparent from both the First Material Breach Application and the Second
Material Breach Application that the Claimants regarded a flat tax as essential to
the successful marketing of the Casino.

The expert evidence is that the market value of the Casino is highly sensitive to
taxation and that establishment of a “fair and reasonable” fixed payment would

enhance the marketability of the Gaming Assets and the price they would fetch in

the market. Rightly or wrongly, the Claimants clearly regarded a “flat tax” as of
the essence of Section 8. It went to the “root” of the Section 8 bargain. The
Claimants’ guantum expert, Dr. Joseph Kalt, proceeded on the basis that a fair and
reasonable flat tax in respect of the Casino would be no more than $2,062,200 each
year for 5 years and assumed such flat tax amounts would escalate by 5% on the
fifth anniversary of the 15 June 2014 Effective Date, and escalate by an additional
5% on every five-year anniversary thereafter, as stated in the Settlement.!”” This
suggested tax burden (which, of course, was no more than an untested opinion) was
materially less than the imposition of an ad valorem tax calculated by the
Government at $26,659,000 and deducted from the proceeds of the sale.

178. In the view of the Tribunal, the Government’s failure to establish a “new” flat tax
similar in form to the “old” flat tax is a breach of Section 8 of the Settlement and
the breach is “material” within the meaning of New York law.

179. Accordingly, on that basis alone, the Claimants are entitled to a revival of the Treaty
arbitration.

iii Did the Government’s Collection of Alleged Tax Arrears of
$26,659,000 Constitute a Material Breach of Section 7 of the
Settlement?

(a) The Claimants’ Position

180. The Claimants contend that they were entitled to pay no more than the "new flat

tax." The Government refused to participate in the Flat Tax Committee even though

the Claimants remained ready, willing and able to do so after the dismissal of the

127 Witness Statement of Joseph P. Kalt, Ph.D., dated 14 October 2016, p. 22.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 348 of 457

First Material Breach Application. The Government was not entitled to affirm and
rely on the Settlement while at the same time attempting to collect a tax that was
not authorized under the Settlement and which no other casino in Laos was required
to pay.
(b) The Government’s Position

181. The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ privileged tax status ended on | July
2014. At that point, being a Casino conducting business in Laos, they were required
to pay the tax established by the law of Laos for such a business. In the absence of
a new flat tax agreement, which was to be established by a process boycotted by
the Claimants, the Claimants were bound by the ordinary law, and having failed to

do so, the Government was entitled to collect the arrears of tax owing.

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
182. The Claimants and the Gaming Assets were required to pay taxes “as from | July
2014 as provided in Section 8 below.” The SIAC majority concluded that there
had been a “new flat tax” established ‘as provided in Section 8 below”, and

therefore the Claimants were in default for not paying the 28% ad valorem tax as

required by Section 7.!?8

183. In light of the conclusion of the Tribunal that no “new flat tax” had been established

within the meaning of Section 8, and that the Claimants had, after numerous

28 Section 7 provides:
7. Laos shall forgive and waive any and all taxes and related interest and penalties due and payable
by the Claimants and the Gaming Assets up to 1 July 2014 in respect of the Gaming Assets,
provided, however, that taxes shall be due and payable as from | July 2014 as provided in
Section 8 below. The taxes covered herein are all taxes and fees including but not limited to those
that are specifically indicated in Article | of the previously signed FTA attached as Annex D hereto.
(emphasis added)

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 349 of 457

breaches of the Settlement, attempted to rejoin the FTC process, and moreover that
the Government had (notwithstanding these breaches) elected to continue to affirm
the Settlement, it follows that there was no tax properly payable “as provided in
Section 8 below.”

184. However, the Government’s waiver of taxes ended on 30 June 2014. At the time
of the taking of the $29,659,000, the Casino had paid no taxes whatsoever since
December 31, 2013. The Casino had no right to operate in Laos free of tax.

185. The ICSID Tribunal in rejecting the Claimants’ Second Application for Provisional

Measures on 18 March 2015 stated in relevant part:

When the Flat Tax Agreement expired on 31 December [2013],
Savan Vegas became subject to the applicable tax laws of Laos.
It is common ground that although Savan Vegas has continued to
do business in Laos, it has not paid taxes either directly or in
escrow since 1 January [2014]. While it now offers to pay in
escrow the sum of US $429,300 per month retroactive to 1 January
[2014], there is no obligation on the Government to agree to such
a figure or to any escrow arrangement.!7°

... [For so long as the Claimant continues to do business in Laos,
it can reasonably expect to be bound by the Laotian income tax
laws applicable to gambling casinos unless and until a new Flat
Tax Agreement is negotiated.'*°
186. At some point, the Claimants’ tax liability will have to be assessed and paid.
Accordingly, while the Tribunal considers that the Government departed from its

obligations under Section 7, the breach in this instance is not material because there

is an accumulating tax debt owed by the Claimants, and any recalculation of the

29 Decision on Claimant’s Second Application for Provisional Measures, dated 18 March 2015, para. 32.
130 Tid, para. 34.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 350 of 457

precise amount of tax owing does not in any sense rob the Claimants of the
substantial benefit of their Section 7 bargain. This ground offers no independent
basis for a revival of the Treaty arbitration.
iv. Did the Government’s Failure to Establish a Joint Escrow Account
to Receive the Proceeds of Sale of the Gaming Assets Constitute a
Material Breach of Section 15 of the Settlement?
(a) The Claimants’ Position
187. Under the terms of Section 15, the proceeds of the sale of the Gaming Assets were
to be received directly from the buyer [Macau Legend] “into an escrow account ...
under instructions to be jointly issued by the Claimants and Laos.”!*!
188. In the Second Material Breach Application, the Claimants argue that the
Government breached Section 15 in at least two material ways:

(a) The Government caused Macau Legend to deposit all of the sale
proceeds into bank accounts wholly controlled, directly or indirectly, by
the Government; and

(b) The Government impermissibly diverted US $26,659,000 million of the
$42 million purchase price into its own treasury in purported satisfaction

132

of the Claimants’ alleged tax liability. '°~ Such a unilateral “taking” was

not permitted by the Settlement.

131 Section 15 provides:
15. All Sale proceeds shall be received directly from the buyer into an escrow account at TMF
Trustees Singapore Limited in Singapore under instructions to be jointly issued by the Claimants
and Laos. No moneys shall be withdrawn from such escrow account except in compliance with this
document. The Claimants and Savan Vegas (in the case of assets sale rather than corporate sale)
shall have no liability to pay any withholding or capital gains taxes in respect of the Sale.

 

'82 Memorial, para. 141, Reply, paras. 19(e), 32.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 351 of 457

189. This Section 15 breach is independent of whether or not the Gaming Assets were
sold for maximum value. Rather, Section 15 is separate and apart from Section 13
and requires all proceeds, regardless of the amount, to be deposited directly into

escrow. !33

(b) The Government’s Position
190. The escrow account was established in consultation with the SIAC Tribunal. The
Claimants were bound and determined to undermine the Settlement and giving
them a veto over the payment of funds from a jointly controlled escrow account
would have allowed them to create endless mischief and delay. The SIAC Tribunal
in effect endorsed this view in its Award of 29 June 2017. In any event, the
Claimants ultimately received their full financial entitlement under the order of the
President of the SIAC Tribunal annexed to the Award of 29 June 2017. If there was

a breach, therefore, it was not material.

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
191. In the course of the SIAC proceedings, the escrow procedure was modified. After

ordering the parties to work together to establish the escrow account and issue “joint

instructions”, '*4 the SIAC Tribunal directed payment of the sale proceeds into an

133 Reply, para. 30.
134 ©-1095, Order on Respondents’ Request for Provisional Measures and Claimant’s Motion for a Stay of
Discovery and Motion Practice, SIAC, 6 January 2016, para. 10:
The Tribunal grants the request to the extent of requiring the parties to work together to establish
the escrow account by 30 March 2016 and issue before that date joint instructions to TMF Trustees
Singapore Limited for procedures for the receipt and disbursement of funds. The Tribunal cannot
at this time, on this record, resolve the question of the amount to be deposited into escrow under the
Deed. The Tribunal will examine the question anew if the parties do not submit the joint instruction
by the date required (30 March 2016) or if either party submits a motivated request for interpretation

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 352 of 457

escrow account under the control of the President of the SIAC Tribunal. It is
evident from the SIAC Award of 29 June 2017 that the Claimants continued to
favour the sale of the Casino (albeit on different terms from those favoured by the
Government) in their appearances before the SIAC Tribunal.) “Interim”
arrangements for an escrow account were worked out in conjunction with the SIAC
Tribunal. The President of the SIAC Tribunal signed a “Tribunal Payment Notice”
attached to the SIAC Award of 29 June 2017 clearing the escrow account.

192. The escrow account as established accomplished its functional purpose. While its
terms differed from the arrangements described in Section 15, the differences do
not amount to a material breach. The Claimants have not established any loss or
other damage flowing from the escrow arrangements. !?5

193. Accordingly, the Tribunal declines to find a material breach of Section 15.

y. Did the Government’s Failure to Include the Right to Extend the
Savannakhet Airport Runway as Part of the Gaming Assets
Constitute a Material Breach of Section 25?

(a) The Claimants’ Position

194. The Claimants contend that the right to expand the Savannakhet Airport was a key
contributor to the potential value of the Casino. The Government, it says, falsely
represented to prospective purchasers (in the RSE report) that expansion to

accommodate Boeing 737 type aircraft was not feasible. However, the Government

of the Deed including a substantiated record of the positions taken by the parties and defining the
dispute on interpretation to be resolved.
'35 The Government contends that the Claimants’ desire for “joint” control was to enable them to precipitate
an impasse and roil any sale.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 353 of 457

was obligated to do what was necessary to enable the Claimants (at their own

expense) to extend the runway at Savannakhet Airport.!*°

(b) The Government’s Position
195. Both parties acknowledge that there is not enough land at Savannakhet Airport to
lengthen the runway sufficiently to accommodate the normal operations of a Boeing
737 size aircraft. At no time did the Government represent otherwise.
196. Moreover, the Government gave no undertaking, express or implied, to expropriate

private land for the benefit of a private developer.

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
197. The “right” asserted by the Claimants is found in Section 25 which reads in relevant

part that:

The Claimants or a new owner of the Gaming Assets (the “SV
Owner” as the case may be) shall have the right to make the
necessary investment (free of all cost to Laos) to extend the
existing runway at Savannakhet Airport sufficiently to
accommodate planes up to Boeing 737 size ...
198. The Claimants contend that “if an expansion had not been feasible because the
Government was unwilling to exercise its eminent domain powers or, alternatively,
to allow jets to use the Airport with payload and range restrictions, there would

have been no point to the Parties’ inclusion of Section 25 in the Deed.” 7 However,

there is no persuasive evidence in the Settlement documentation or elsewhere that

36 Memorial, para. 144, Reply, para. 19(g).
'57 Memorial, para. 145.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 354 of 457

the Government undertook either of these measures. The exercise of power of
eminent domain is certainly not mentioned in the Settlement.

199. In the view of the Tribunal, this ground is without merit. The new owner of the
Gaming Assets is free to make “the necessary investment” itself by acquiring land
from the current owners if suitable terms can be worked out by private contracts.

200. There is no evidence to suggest any legal or regulatory restraint on the Casino
owner’s expenditure of private monies for this purpose. However, in the Tribunal’s
view, there is no obligation on the Government to facilitate such an acquisition of
land belonging to other private owners for the private benefit of the Claimants or
their successors.

201. The Tribunal concludes that there is therefore no material breach in connection with
the extension of the Savannakhet Airport.

vi. Did the Government’s Alleged Failure to Negotiate the Thakhaek
Agreements “in Good Faith” Constitute a Material Breach of
Section 22 of the Settlement?

202. The Thakhaek Free Enterprise Zone is an area some distance from the Savan Vegas
Hotel and Casino complex. The Claimants desired about 90 hectares for
development “completely separate from the provision for sale of the Gaming
Assets.”'?8 Such a potential development had been the subject of a Memorandum

of Understanding with Savan Vegas dated 20 October 2010.

38 Reply, para. 36.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 355 of 457

203. A condition precedent to negotiations for the Thakhaek development was the
payment of US $500,000 to the Government which was paid by the Claimants. !°°
204. In the course of negotiations, a dispute arose over the inclusion (or not) of a 16
hectares’ portion of land fronting National Road 13. It emerged that the 16

hectares’ parcel was privately owned.

(a) The Claimants’ Position
205. The Claimants assert that the 16 hectares parcel of private land with its highway
frontage was critical to the success of the contemplated development. It was
included in the parcel of 90 hectares as shown on a map attached to the said
Memorandum of Understanding and referred to in a number of subsequent “draft
agreements.” The Claimants then say the “Government summarily rejected without

explanation Claimants’ proposal for an alternative concession arrangement that

would compensate it for the loss of the 16 hectares.” 4°

39 Section 22 provides as follows:
22. Subject to the Claimants’ payment of US $500,000 to Laos, the Parties will negotiate in good
faith and conclude a land concession and project development agreement with respect to the 90
hectares of land at Thakhaet identified in the MOU signed on 20 October 2010 between Savan Vegas
and Governor Khambhay Damlath of Khammouane Province, LAO PDR, on the basis that no
gaming activities whatsoever will be allowed at or in connection with that 90 hectares site. The
Claimants acknowledge and agree that: (i) there shall be no gaming license, sublicense or other grant
of gaming rights issued by Laos at any time in respect of such 90 hectares site; (ii) any development
of, at or pertaining to such 90 hectares site shall be in the form of commercial, non-gaming activities
only; and (iii) the Claimants shall have no right to claim or receive any compensation from Laos in
regard to the prohibition of gaming activities at such 90 hectares site. Fees and charges, if any,
imposed in connection with the project at the 90 hectares site shall be commensurate with those

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 356 of 457

(b) The Government’s Position
206. The 16 hectares parcel is in private ownership and was not included in the 90
hectares contemplated for development. The original survey attached to the MOU
showed about 105 acres, which included 15 acres in private ownership. The
Government made no promise of land it did not own. Eventually, the Government
offered the Claimants an alternative 90 acres in the same special Economic Zone,
but the Claimants would not agree to develop the property themselves but suggested
they would invite other investors to build within a type of “Dubai Free Trade Zone.”
This was a role reversal which the Government considered to be a fundamental

departure from Section 22.'*!

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
207. In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants have not established a land entitlement that
includes the disputed 16 hectares, and there is no undertaking by the Government
in Section 22 to use its powers of eminent domain to expropriate the existing private
owners for the financial benefit of the Claimants. Refusal to expropriate private

land for private gain of the Claimant does not constitute evidence of “bad faith.”

141 As explained by Government counsel:

... the parties went back and forth. The government offered, “If you want another 90 hectares in a
Special Economic Zone, we have lots of land in the Thakhaet region that’s in a Special Economic
Zone”, so they were making offers back and forth.

Then Mr. James wrote a letter, Mr. Menezes, and said, “Our proposal is to create a Dubai Free Trade
Zone in Thakhaet, which means the business we build, we won't build our own business, we'll turn
it into a Free Trade Zone, so other investors can come until and build buildings and they won’t have
to pay tax.”

  

 

So the government said, “That’s not acceptable, more than not acceptable”, and that was the end of
negotiations. They refused to make another offer. (Hearing Transcript 3 July 2017, p. 200)

210.

Moreover, Section 22 does not oblige the Government to negotiate an alternative
concession, especially when the Claimants’ plan was to try to attract other
developers rather than develop the property themselves.

In the view of the Tribunal, the Claimants’ Section 22 argument is without merit.

vii. Did the Government’s Failure to Discontinue Criminal
Investigations Against the Claimants and their Principals
Constitute a Material Breach of Section 23 and Section 27?

The Government has made numerous allegations of criminality against the

Claimants and their principals, in particular, John Baldwin and Shawn Scott, as

142

outlined above.

21

As part of the Settlement, the parties agreed in Section 23 that:

Laos shall discontinue the current criminal investigations against
Sanum/Savan Vegas and its management or other personnel and
shall not reinstate such investigations provided that the terms
and conditions agreed herein are duly and fully implemented
by the Claimants. (emphasis added)

212. Section 27 provided for mutual releases subject to similar conditions. 4?

Section 27 provides:
The Claimants hereby wholly waive and release any and all claims whatsoever against Laos and all
officials thereof and advisors, counsels and experts thereto related, and to forego the lodging of any
dispute or claim against any of them, and shall ensure that each of the following persons — the direct
and indirect shareholders, personnel, affiliates, subsidiaries and managers of the Claimants, John
Baldwin and Shawn Scott — shall also wholly waive and release any and all claims whatsoever
against Laos and all officials thereof and advisors, counsels and experts thereto related and forego
the lodging of any dispute or claim against any of them. The Claimants shall fully indemnify Laos
and all officials thereof and advisors, counsels and experts thereto in the event that any direct and
indirect shareholders, personnel, affiliates, subsidiaries and managers of the Claimants, John
Baldwin and Shawn Scott shall fail to provide such waiver and release. Laos hereby waives and
releases any and all claims with respect to the matters addressed in the arbitrations against the
Claimants, shareholders, officers and directors and the Gaming Assets companies. Notwithstanding
the above, if the arbitrations suspended hereby, or either of them is or are revived or re-instated to
any extent by either Party, then the releases and waivers provided herein shall be null and void and

216.

(a) The Claimants’ Position
The Government is currently pursuing applications for third-party discovery
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. s. 1782 before U.S. federal courts ostensibly in support of the
same allegations of bribery that the Government had asserted in the criminal
investigation and in the SIAC arbitration as a ground for terminating the 2007

Savan Vegas PDA.'#

(b) The Government’s Position
The agreement to discontinue current criminal investigations was expressly
conditional on the Claimants “duly and fully” observing the “terms and conditions
agreed herein.” The Claimants breached numerous “terms and conditions.” The

Government was therefore entitled to revive the “current criminal investigations.”

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
Section 23 is a limited undertaking by the Government restricted to “current
criminal investigations of offences” known to the Government as of the date of
Settlement (15 June 2014) and being investigated prior to the date of the Settlement.
The Government continues to pursue the benefits of the Settlement. In exchange
for those benefits, a major consideration for the principals of LHNV and Sanum
was the Government’s agreement to discontinue the “current criminal

investigations.”'** As a matter of New York law, as discussed previously, the

any and all claims previously made and facts asserted in the arbitration(s) are not waived and no
liability of either party thereunder is waived or released.

Memorial, paras. 165-166.

44 As noted by the dissenting arbitrator in the SIAC Award of 29 June 2017, paras. 100, 101:

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 359 of 457

Government is not entitled to resile from a major benefit of the Settlement on the
basis of breaches by the Claimants (that predate the multiple affirmations by the
Government) while at the same time affirming its determination to sell the Gaming
Assets under the authority of the same Settlement. Nevertheless, the Government
is currently pursuing evidence of criminality in the U.S. Federal Courts in Idaho
and the North Mariana Island. !45

217. The Section 23 undertaking is limited. Section 23 does not cover acts of potential
criminality that existed as of the date of the Settlement but were not known to the
Government at that time, or were known but were not at the time of the Settlement
the subject of a “current criminal investigation.” This means that the Settlement
did not in any way (regardless of any material breach) impede the Government from
launching a criminal investigation after the date of the Settlement into facts that
pre-dated the Settlement provided there was no ongoing investigation at the time of
the Settlement. Indeed, much of the alleged criminality now of concern to the

Government were facts that predated the Settlement but became known to the

If Claimant chose to perform the Deed by taking the Casino, selling it, and setting a Flat Tax
reportedly consistent with the Deed, it cannot deny Respondents the benefit of Paragraph 23 of the
Deed.
I cannot join the Majority in reaching a conclusion that, as the Majority acknowledges, would give
only Laos the benefit of the bargain while depriving Sanum entirely of one of the few benefits of
the Deed it was entitled to.

The Court is also particularly swayed by GOL’s seeming disregard for the Deed of Settlement. In
June 2014, GOL was apparently satisfied that Baldwin and other owners and managers at the Savan
Vegas were not criminals. It agreed not to prosecute them as part of the settlement. Despite the
failure of the settlement to actually resolve the issues facing the Savan Vegas, the parties agreed to

be bound by its terms, including non-prosecution.

Government only after the date of the Settlement, when the Government gained
access to the books and records of the Claimants, including allegations that:

(a) The Claimants induced Mr. Angus Noble to sign a fraudulent MOU
purporting to offer to buy the Gaming Assets and knowingly suborned
false testimony from Mr. Noble [by paying him] $10,000 per month for
twenty-one (21) months; !4°

(b) In late spring-early summer 2015, after the Settlement, Mr. Baldwin
hatched a scheme to bribe Government officials in an attempt to
recover control of Savan Vegas. The Government points to a draft
consulting agreement with an unemployed security guard, Mr. Ben
Gersten, disclosing (the Government says), the bribe that Mr. Baldwin
was willing to pay to Government officials to permit Sanum to recover
control of the Casino despite the Settlement;

(c) The Government says it has discovered numerous documented and
uncontroverted acts of bribery and other illegality uncovered after
the Settlement was signed;

(d) The Government says that it emerged after the Settlement that Mr.
Baldwin authorized a bribe of $30,000 to obtain the original 2009
Savan Vegas Flat Tax Agreement, and paid various other bribes to have

the Thanaleng slot club shut down, to tamper with witnesses in the

'46 According to the Claimants, “the Government's efforts to construct a conspiracy theory out of innocuous
and unremarkable facts — that the MOU was negotiated quickly, that it was based on a template from a prior
deal, and that Mr. Nobel had other dealings with the Claimants’ principals and one of their family members
— prove nothing and require no further response. Reply, para. 86.

court case with his former partner, ST, and to obtain a lottery license
in Cambodia.
The Tribunal, of course, has no views on whether these more recent allegations by
the Government are true or not. What is at issue under Section 23 in contrast, are
acts of criminality that were known and were being “currently” investigated as of
15 June 2014.
As a matter of New York law, the Government was not entitled to disregard a major
benefit of the Settlement to the Claimants or their principals involving their
personal jeopardy on the basis of breaches of the Settlement by the Claimants while
proceeding to sell the Casino under the authority of the same Settlement.
As to materiality, pursuit or renewal of the “current criminal investigations” clearly
goes to the heart of the benefits promised to the Claimants in Section 23. Indeed
revival of “current criminal” investigations deprives the Claimants of the only
benefit promised the Claimants under Section 23.
The Government was not free to revive the “current criminal investigations” unless
it had been willing to repudiate the Settlement, and had done so.
Having not done so, it was not open to the Government to deny the Claimants the
major and significant benefit of Section 12 and on that account, as well, the

Claimants are entitled to revival of the Treaty arbitration.

CONCLUSION
The Tribunal does not underestimate the Government’s frustration with the
intransigence of the Claimants’ post-settlement conduct whose efforts from 4 July

2014 to June 2015 were clearly directed to undermining the Settlement and

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 362 of 457

extricating themselves from its terms. Unfortunately for the Government, it wanted
to retain the Settlement as much as the Claimants wanted to get rid of it. Faced

with this dilemma, the Government chose to affirm the Settlement.

VIII. COSTS
(a) The Claimants’ Position
224. The Claimants claim costs if successful. If unsuccessful, the Claimants argue that
the Government’s claim for costs should be rejected because:

(a) New York’s highest court has explained that, unless clearly provided in
the underlying contract, the American rule that parties are responsible
for their own attorney’s fees applies. There is no language in the
Settlement indicating any intent of the parties to indemnify each other
for costs;

(b) In any event, the Tribunal would not have jurisdiction over a Section 28
claim for damages since its jurisdiction is reserved to the specific

provisions listed in Section 32.'4”

(b) The Government’s Position
225. The Government also claims costs. In part, it relies on Section 28 of the Settlement,
a general provision for indemnification of damages arising out of a breach of the

Settlement.

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling
Costs, including the costs of the Mareva injunction, are deferred until the Award

on the Merits following the hearing on the revived treaty claims.

DECISION
The Second Material Breach Application is allowed.
Pursuant to Section 32 of the Settlement, the Treaty arbitration is revived on the
basis jointly and severally of the Government’s breaches of:
(a) Section 8, which promised a “new flat tax’, but instead the Government
imposed a 28% ad valorem tax on gross gaming revenues;
(b) Section 23, which promised the Claimants relief from “current criminal
investigations”, which nevertheless have been revived.
Both of these breaches constitute material breaches that deprived the Claimants of
the intended benefits (or “bargain”) promised by each of Section 8 and Section 23.
Except as aforesaid, the grounds of revival relied on by the Claimants are rejected.
The parties are instructed to confer and propose to the Tribunal a timetable for the
renewed Treaty arbitration within 30 days of the date of this decision.
A pre-hearing teleconference to resolve any outstanding issues will be held within
45 days of the date of this decision.
The issue of costs of this application is reserved to be dealt with at the conclusion

of the hearing on the merits.

OVERVIEW

Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Shawn Scott, two U.S. entrepreneurs who were experienced
in a number of businesses including gambling facilities, became involved in casinos
and slot machines in Laos in 2007. For this purpose, they caused two companies to be
incorporated in Aruba, the Netherlands Antilles Lao Holdings NV (“LHNV”), and a
subsidiary Sanum Investments (“Sanum”) in Macau (collectively referred to as “the
Claimants”). Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Scott, using various corporate structures partnered
with a Laotian conglomerate (“ST Holdings”) in two casino projects and three slot
machine clubs in Laos positioned near its border with Thailand. One of the casinos,
the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino (“Savan Vegas”), was built and operated
successfully. The second casino, Paksong Vegas Casino (“Paksong Vegas”), was

never built.

Within three years there was a falling out between the Claimants and their local
partners. ST Holdings ceased cooperation with Sanum, initiated litigation against it
and shut Sanum out of Thanaleng, the most profitable of the slot clubs. Mr. John
Baldwin testified that ST Holdings was closely connected to leading politicians in the
Respondent Government. He said that ST Holdings orchestrated a series of wrongful
Government acts against LHNV which led to the result, designed by the Government,
of driving Sanum out of Laos and appropriating for the Government the wealth created

by the investment and expertise of Mr. Baldwin and his associated companies.

The Claimants initiated arbitrations by LHNV under the bilateral investment treaties
between Laos and the Netherlands,' and by Sanum pursuant to a similar investment
treaty between Laos and Macau (now China).? These arbitrations have consumed
multiple proceedings and years of litigation. Eventually Sanum obtained an award
against ST Holdings from the Singapore International Arbitration Centre (“SIAC”) for
over US $200 million. LHNV is not a claimant before this Tribunal, and the Tribunal

does not purport to address its claims. However, much of the evidence of Mr. John

' Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the
Netherlands, signed on 16 May 2003, in force since 1 May 20

vaare ement betw ‘een the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of The Lao People’s

ic Republic C ing the Ei and Reciprocal Protection of | dated 31 January

1093, as amended on 10 April 2006.

Baldwin is related to both companies, and as he was the directing mind of both
companies, and their principal witness, references will be made to LHNV from time to
time (or collectively to “the Claimants” in the plural) as part of the background to the
disposition of the Sanum claims. Moreover, counsel for the Claimants advised that it
did not withdraw “any factual allegations, as the totality of the facts remain relevant

to certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants will seek relief”?

2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

4. The Tribunal has issued the following decisions during the proceeding: (i) Award on
Jurisdiction of 13 December 2013; (ii) Interim Ruling on Issues Arising Under the Deed
of Settlement of 19 December 2014 and (iii) Decision on the Merits of the Claimant’s
Second Material Breach Application of 15 December 2017 (“Decision on the Second
Material Breach”). The full procedural history of this case is described in these
decisions. These Decisions, and the Decision on the Second Material Breach, are an

integral part of the Award.

5. The procedural details of this arbitration following the Decision on the Second Material

Breach are summarized below.
6. In the Decision on the Second Material Breach, the Tribunal ruled as follows:

(a) the Second Material Breach Application is allowed;

(b

pursuant to Section 32 of the Settlement, the Treaty arbitration is revived on the
basis jointly and severally of the Government’s breaches of:

(i) Section 8, which promised a “new flat tax”, but instead the Government
imposed a 28% ad valorem tax on gross gaming revenues;

(ii) Section 23, which promised the Claimant relief from “current criminal
investigations,” which nevertheless have been revived;

(c

both of these breaches constitute material breaches that deprived the Claimant of
the intended benefits (or “bargain’”’) promised by each of Section 8 and Section 23;

(d

except as aforesaid, the grounds of revival relied on by the Claimant are rejected;

(e) the parties are instructed to confer and propose to the Tribunal a timetable for
the renewed arbitration within 30 days of the date of this decision;

(f) apre-hearing teleconference to resolve any outstanding issues will be held within
45 days of the date of this decision;

the issue of costs is reserved to be dealt with at the conclusion of the hearing on
the merits.

propose a timetable for the renewed Treaty arbitrations, as requested by the Tribunals’
Decisions on the Merits of the Claimant’s Second Material Breach Applications of

the revived arbitration be set for a merits hearing to take place at a reasonable time after
the scheduled hearing of related but separate proceedings, identified as Lao Holdings
N.V. v. Lao People’s Democratic Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/2)/ Sanum
Investments Limited v. Lao People’s Democratic Republic (ICSID Case No.
ADHOC/17/1) (the “BIT II Proceedings”), and proposed an in-person pre-hearing
conference, to explore with the Tribunals how to proceed and to receive any instructions

the Tribunals may have.

By letter dated 18 January 2018, the Respondent objected to the Tribunals’ Interim
Decision on the Claimant’s Second Material Breach Applications. By the same letter,
the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s suggestion that the hearings for the revived
proceedings be delayed until the conclusion of the BIT II Proceedings. The Respondent
proposed a hearing schedule and stated its desire to complete the original disputes as

soon as possible.

By letter dated 26 January 2018, the Claimant provided further comments regarding the
basis for a post-January 2019 hearing.

By letter dated 30 January 2018, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment,
should it wish, on the Claimant’s assertions concerning the matters raised in the letter
dated 26 January 2018. The Respondent provided its response by letter dated 9
February 2018.

3.2. The Original Treaty Claims

The Claimants allege expropriation without compensation and Treaty breaches in
respect of their investment in gambling projects described in the Project Development
Agreement (“PDA”) dated 10 August 2007 in respect of the Savan Vegas Casino, as
well as the three slot clubs, Thanaleng, Lao Bao and Savannakhet Ferry. The claims
also relate to the expected expansion of the Savannakhet Airport and opportunities for

development in the Special Economic Zone at Thakhet.

On 14 August 2012, Sanum Investments Limited, a LHNV subsidiary which operated
the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino, initiated its claim before the PCA for alleged
violations of the Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China
and the Government of The Lao People’s Democratic Republic Concerning The
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 31 January 1993 and

the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as revised in 2010.

Also on 14 August 2012, LHNV initiated its ICSID proceedings against the
Respondent, before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(“ICSID” or the “Centre’) pursuant to the Agreement on Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments between Laos and the Kingdom of the
Netherlands,> and the Arbitration Rules (Additional Facility) of ICSID (“ICSID-AF
Rules”).6

While the proceedings before the two Tribunals are distinct and separate, the
proceedings were the subject of joint hearings in Singapore and elsewhere.
Accordingly, for ease of reference only, LHNV and Sanum will be referred to as "the

Claimants", as the facts of the cases are intermingled. This terminology is not to

Q. And then the money that was in 2008, can you say during roughly what month?
A. Well, the largest amount of money was paid prior to the Savan — was paid in probably the last six
months of 2008.

Q. During all of that time in 2007 and 2008, did you have a flat tax agreement yet?

A. Yes.

Q. Prior — let me show you some documents. Let me show you —

A. Well, we had an agreement to get the flat tax agreement. The flat tax was approved — the flat tax
was approved by Prime Minister Bouasone in [29 December 2008].

suggest, however, that the two arbitral proceedings are consolidated or otherwise

conjoined.

3.3. Claims and Counterclaims

The Claimants’ original Treaty claims were based on a multiplicity of alleged treaty
breaches by the Government including (but not limited to) an 80% tax on casino
revenues and what the Claimants contended were unfair and oppressive audits of the
Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. In addition, the Claimants alleged that the Government
abused its sovereign authority to assist ST Holdings to acquire other assets which
belonged in whole or in part, to the Claimants. In the Treaty proceedings, the Claimants
eventually valued their investment loss as of 31 August 2016 at between

US $690 million and US $1 billion.”

3.4. The Settlement and its Aftermath

The Treaty claims were thought to have been resolved by a Deed of Settlement
concluded between the Parties during the merits hearing in Singapore on 15 June 2014
(to be read together with a Side Letter dated 18 June 2014) (herein referred to

collectively as “the Settlement”).

Shortly after the Settlement, the Claimants alleged that the Government had committed
a material breach of its terms which entitled them to a revival of the Treaty arbitrations
(“the First Material Breach Application”). The Government contested jurisdiction.
On 11 August 2014, the Government filed a Notice of Arbitration with the SIAC
pursuant to paragraphs 35 and 42 of the Settlement, seeking an order directing Sanum

to comply with its obligations under the Settlement.

The ICSID and PCA Tribunals held a hearing on 14 October 2014 in Washington, D.C.
on the objections to jurisdiction, which were dismissed. However, on 20 January 2015,
the High Court of the Republic of Singapore held that the PCA Tribunal did not possess
subject matter jurisdiction under the Laos-China BIT because of the status of Macau

and issues of state succession not here relevant, as well as the limitation in the BIT,

according to which “only disputes over the amount of compensation for expropriation
can be submitted to arbitration.”® This judgment was later reversed by the Court of

Appeal of Singapore on 29 September 2016.9

3.5. Delimitation of the Relief Presently Sought by the Claimants

The Claimants’ Second Material Breach Application was successful, and on
15 December 2017, the Hearing on the merits of the “revived” claim was ordered to
proceed. On 26 March 2018, the Claimants advised the Tribunal of the claims for which
they no longer sought relief, namely, in respect of the PCA proceedings, “Article 6
expropriation claim regarding the [Savan Vegas], its Article 6 expropriation claim
regarding Ferry Terminal or Lao Bao slot clubs [...], or its claims regarding

Respondent’s seizure of its bank account in breach of Articles 3(2), 3(4), 4, 5, and 6.”!"

The Claimants’ letter of 26 March 2018 notionally divided and separated their claims
concerning LHNV (Thanaleng, Savan Vegas and the Ferry Terminal and Lao Bao slots)
and Sanum (Thanaleng, Paksan, Thakhet and Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino). As
mentioned, however, counsel for the Claimants asserted in the same letter that “the
totality of the facts remain relevant to certain treaty breaches for which the Claimants
will seek relief.” Equally, the Respondent conjoined its “clean hands” defence to all
claims by both Claimants at issue in the ICSID and PCA proceedings involving Mr.
John Baldwin and the various interrelated allegations of bribery and corruption.
Accordingly, it will be necessary for the Tribunal to address “the totality” of the factual
circumstances of the listed projects of both Claimants insofar as they are relevant to the

position of Sanum.

Sanum maintained the expropriation claim pursuant to Article 4 of the Treaty regarding the

Thanaleng slot club, Paksan, Thakhet and the Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino.

4. RELEVANT ARTICLES OF THE BIT
74. The Preamble to the Treaty provides, in relevant part:

The Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of
the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (hereinafter referred to as Contracting
States), Desiring to encourage, protect and create favorable conditions for

paragraph 1 of this Article, it may be submitted at the request of either party
to an ad hoc arbitral tribunal. The provisions of this paragraph shall not apply
if the investor concerned has resorted to the procedure specified in the
paragraph 2 of this Article.

OTHER MATTERS
5.1. Other Legal Provisions

The Respondent argues that, in addition to the BIT, domestic law is relevant to the
existence of the Claimants’ contractual rights and the legality of the conduct of the
foreign investors. Furthermore, there are international norms such as “[t]he United
Nations Convention Against Corruption which defines bribery and money laundering
as fundamental criminal offenses that undermine the international system of foreign
trade.”!! It is the contention of the Respondent that the Claimants violated the BIT, the

laws of Laos and international norms.

According to the Claimant Sanum’s Reply, the “[BIT] clearly governs this dispute.”!?
The United Nations Convention Against Corruption (“UNCAC”) “creates obligations

only for the state Parties, to develop anti-corruption policies, practices, and task forces.

It does not bind or purport to bind the conduct of entities such as the Claimant.”!? The
Claimants also question the Respondent’s appeal to international public policy and, in
particular, the international standard for the gaming industry based on domestic gaming
regulations of just four jurisdictions, none of them applicable to the Claimants’ projects

in Laos.

While the Claimants admit that domestic statutes obviously do determine whether
certain alleged acts are legal or illegal for the purposes of domestic law, domestic law

does not dictate the consequences for an investor’s claims under the Treaty.

The Claimants argue that “once an investor has established its investment in conformity
with the host state’s laws, that investment falls within the scope of the treaty (assuming
all of the other jurisdictional hurdles have been cleared), and the investor is prima facie
entitled to its protections.”'* The Claimants further argue that the cases that “consider
whether allegations of misconduct constitute a proper defence on the merits do not
assist Laos because tribunals have required Respondents to demonstrate that the actions

taken in breach of the treaty were actually justified by the misconduct.”!5

The Claimants also dispute the relevance of the “uncontroversial proposition that
arbitral tribunals have an inherent power to preserve the integrity of their own process
...”!6 The Claimants equally reject the applicability of the “unclean hands” doctrine
and note that the Respondent has not cited any case in which a tribunal has sanctioned

post-investment behaviour with a full dismissal of the Claimant’s case.

5.2. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The law to be applied by the Tribunal is determined by the Treaty. The Treaty is an
international instrument that to the extent it requires interpretation will be interpreted
by the Tribunal in accordance with the provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law
of the Treaties (“WCLT”) to which both State parties to the Treaty have acceded. As

the Parties admit in their exchanges, the domestic law of the State may also be relevant.

, para, 252.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 396 of 457
-29-

The extent of its relevance is a matter of dispute between the Parties, particularly on the
question of whether to be protected an investment needs to be made and operated
according to the law of the host State. This issue and the disputed applicability of
international policy relate to the defence of illegal conduct and the Tribunal will address

both matters as needed in its consideration of the Respondent’s defence.

5.3. Clarification on the Nature of the Respondent’s Illegality Claims

86. As part of its defence, the Respondent has pleaded that the Tribunal should dismiss all
claims because of the illegal activities in which the Claimants allegedly engaged,
including bribery, embezzlement and money laundering. The Claimants have at times
characterized this defence as a “request for dismissal... for lack of jurisdiction” because

at inception or in its operation the investment of the Claimants was illegal.!7

87. As the Tribunal understands it, the present submission of the Respondent to dismiss all
claims on grounds of illegality is not an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but an
affirmation of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to consider the claims on their merits which,

the Government says, ought to be dismissed because of the Claimants’ illegal conduct.

6. THE RESPONDENT’S THRESHOLD POSITION IS THAT THE CLAIMS
OUGHT NOT TO BE ENTERTAINED BY REASON OF THE CLAIMANTS’
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION

88. At the threshold of its argument, the Respondent contends that the claims should be
dismissed in their entirety, in part because of corruption in the creation of the investments,
and in part because of corruption in the course of performance of the various PDAs and

unsuct

  

ful initiatives by the Claimants to obtain licences for new gambling facilities.

89. The Respondent alleges that the principals behind the Claimants, Mr. John Baldwin and
Mr. Sean Scott, were quite brazen about how to do business in a culture of corruption.
However, Mr. Baldwin says, they steadfastly resisted. In this respect, Mr. Baldwin
testified that:

 

Laos can be quite a corrupt country ... As I met fellow busin en in Laos,
I came to realize that almost every major business operating in Laos has paid

money under the table for their concessions, or their flat tax agreements or
other Government approvals. Sanum, however, has not.'*
90. In his re-examination at the Hearing, Mr. John Baldwin made an even more emphatic
denial of corrupt activities: “I gave strict instructions always that we weren’t paying

any bribes.”!°

91. The allegations of bribery in the course of making the initial investment include:

(a) an alleged bribe of US $30,000 to Laotian tax authorities to obtain approval of
the original 2009 Flat Tax Agreement which the Claimants regarded as essential

to their investment in their flagship Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino project;

(b) payment of US $25,000 to Government officials to procure a licence for the
Claimants’ proposed Thakhaek Slot Club and Welcome Centre.?°

92. The allegations of bribery in the course of performance of the PDAs and related

tives include:

 

(a) payment of US $875,000 to the Claimants’ consultant in the Laos private sector,
Madam Sengkeo Phimmasone, to bribe Government officials to stop an audit by
Ernst & Young (“E&Y”) of Savan Vegas in order to avoid disclosure of the
Claimants’ illegal activity*! and witness tampering (Madam Sengkeo
Phimmasone refused to make herself available to testify in these proceedings.

The Respondent alleges she was paid by the Claimants to stay away);

'S John Baldwin Second Witness Statement dated 9 May 2014, para. 5.

'° Mr. Baldwin testified as follows in re-examination by his counsel:
Q. Mr. Branson asked you a number of questions about the contracts, the consulting contracts, that Mr.
Bouker had that Marty Gersten had written up and you said you hadn’t seen them, but now that you’ ve
seen them, do they cause you to believe that Mr. Bouker was being dispatched to go and bribe people?
A.No.
Q. And why is that?
A, Well, first and foremost, I gave strict instructions always that we weren’t paying any bribes.
That’s number one. I just don’t do it and I’m a stubborn guy and I just don’t — I tell my staff the
same thing always, you know, it’s a slippery slope and you can’t start down it, so that’s number one.
But number two is, you know, fair value [in terms of a success fee] for result for work given, I mean,

allegations are so far removed from the allegations of corruption in Laos, that the

allegations relating to Cambodia will not be considered further.

6.1. Evidence of Bribery and Corruption is Relevant Both at the Time of Investment
and During Subsequent Performance

94. The Parties agree that investment tribunals are rightly sensitive to allegations of
corruption. They agree that the Respondent bears the burden of proof. They disagree
on the standard of proof, i.e. whether a balance of probabilities is sufficient or whether
corruption must be established to the more demanding standard of “clear and

convincing evidence” of corruption. They also, of course, disagree on the facts.

95. There is no doubt that bribery and corruption are contrary to the domestic laws of

Laos.”?

6.1.1. The Respondent’s Argument

96. The Respondent asserts that the Claimants are not legally entitled to maintain any of
their claims in these proceedings as a matter of ordre public international and public

policy.° Corruption, the Respondent argues, is relevant to the initial investment but

also to the investor’s subsequent conduct in relation to the investment in the host

country.*!

97. The difference is that corruption in the making of the investment will raise issues of
jurisdiction for the Tribunal, whereas subsequent acts of corruption will go to a

claimant’s entitlement for relief under the BIT?
98. In particular, the Respondent relies on the analysis in Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan:

While reaching the conclusion that the claims are barred as a result of
corruption, the Tribunal is sensitive to the ongoing debate that findings on
corruption often come down heavily on claimants, while possibly exonerating
defendants that may have themselves been involved in the corrupt acts. It is
true that the outcome in cases of corruption often appears unsatisfactory
because, at first sight at least, it seems to give an unfair advantage to the
defendant party. The idea, however, is not to punish one party at the cost of
the other, but rather to ensure the promotion of the rule of law, which entails
that a court or tribunal cannot grant assistance to a party that has engaged in
acorrupt act. (emphasis added)

99. The Respondent also relies, more generally, on the doctrine of “clean hands”. The
Claimants’ misconduct is sufficient, it is said, to deny them the assistance of investor-

state arbitration.

3! Referencing ICC Dossier: Addressing Issues of Corruption in Commercial and Investment Arbitration, Chapter
11, at para, 31, LHRA-155 (citing Flughafen Ziirich A.G, and Gestion e Ingenieria IDC S.A. v. Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, 1CSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Award, 18 November 2014, at paras. 129-132):
31. The approach to bribery is different in investment arbitrations, where jurisdiction does not derive
from a contract, but rather from an investment treaty. In these cases, validity of contracts is not the
question. The issue is whether an investor who has incurred in corrupt practices when making or
performing the investment can still enjoy protection under the relevant investment treaty. And the
answer is no. (38) Investment arbitration has initiated and led the movement of zero tolerance
towards corruption.

violations of the BIT, but could not deprive a tribunal acting under the authority of the BIT of its
jurisdiction. (emphasis added)

6.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

The Claimants point out that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is founded on the BIT and
neither the Netherlands nor the Chinese BIT contains a provision authorizing a tribunal
to deny the treaty’s protection on the basis that the claimant/investor engaged in
corruption. If the BITs provide no authority to dismiss, the Tribunal would have to
base its decision on customary international law. However, the lack of “clean hands”
is neither a recognized rule of customary international law nor a general principle of

international law and thus affords no authority to dismiss.**

The Claimants acknowledge that corruption in the establishment of an investment
can render a claim inadmissible because treaty protections are only available for valid
investments recognized under the treaty (based upon either an explicit or implied
legality requirement).*> The Claimants deny corruption but in any event deny any
causal connection between the acts of alleged corruption and these claims. The
Respondent only concocted its corruption allegations after the arbitrations were
commenced and in any event has failed to govern itself in a manner consistent with its
international obligations, including due process and good faith, and the prosecution of

bribe-takers as well as alleged bribe-givers.*©

The Claimants’ principal, Mr. John Baldwin, denied the applicability of the “red flags”

approach to the investments in issue here:

Q. Is it possible that when you enter into a consulting contract like this, that
if the event is achieved, the consultant is sent the money and the consultant
then is instructed to pay it to certain government ministers so that it keeps the
company one step removed from proof of the bribe? Isn’t that how it works,
Mr Baldwin?

A. That’s a possibility, although it didn’t happen here.”

6.1.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

103. The Tribunal considers that proof of corruption at any stage of the investment may be
relevant depending on the circumstances. While the UNCAC applies to States rather
than private parties, it embodies what has become a principle of customary international
law applicable, according to the OECD, to root out corruption used “to obtain or retain
business or other undue advantage in relation to the conduct of international
business.”

104. The Respondent also relies on a generalized doctrine of “clean hands” which is a
metaphor employed as a defence to equitable relief in common law jurisdictions.
Incorporation of such a general doctrine into investor-State law without careful
boundaries would risk opening investment disputes to an open-ended, vague and
ultimately unmanageable principle. However, putting aside the label, serious financial
misconduct by the Claimants incompatible with their good faith obligations as investors
in the host country (such as criminality in defrauding the host Government in respect
of an investment) is not without Treaty consequences, both in relation to their attempt
to rely on the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment, as well as their entitlement to

relief of any kind from an international tribunal.

38 UN Convention Against Corruption, Article 16(1), LHRA-16. See also OECD Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions, Article 1(1), Exhibit LHRA-136:
Each Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish that it is a criminal offence
under its law for any person intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other
advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign public official, for that official or
for a third party, in order that the official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of

6.2. The Applicable Standard of Proof
6.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

105. The Respondent notes that many international tribunals have recognized the difficulty
of “proving” bribery and corruption. In the nature of things, the parties to such
transactions are generally careful to leave no paper trail or other direct or documentary
evidence. As a result, if corruption is to be combatted effectively, it is necessary to rely
on inferences from circumstantial evidence. A reasonable approach is to identify “red

flags” which, if established, require the alleged perpetrators to provide an exculpatory

 

explanation of otherwise suspicious conduct. In Metal-Tech v. Uzbekistan,® for

example, the tribunal considered probative of corruption the Government’s evidence of

substantial payments to a consultant where:
(a) the consultant lacks experience in the sector,
(b) the consultant is not a resident of the country where the project is located;

(c) the consultant has no significant business presence or experience within the

country;

(d

the consultant requests “urgent” payments and/or unusually high commissions;

(e

the consultant requests payments be made in cash, be made in a third country, to
a numbered bank account, or to some other person or entity than the one with

whom the agreement was signed;

(f) the consultant has a close personal/professional relationship to the Government

that could improperly influence the decision.”

6.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

The Claimants contend that the applicable standard of proof of corruption in
international law is “clear and convincing evidence” which must consist of
“substantial facts” not mere “inferences”.*! Relevance is placed on Waguih Elie
George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt, where the tribunal
held that “the applicable standard of proof is greater than the balance of probabilities
but less than beyond a reasonable doubt.” The term favoured by the Claimants is “clear

and convincing evidence.”*”

6.2.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal acknowledges the difficulty of proving corruption as well as the
importance of exposing corruption where it exists. In the nature of the offence, the
person offering the bribe and the person accepting it will take care to cover their
tracks. Nevertheless, given the seriousness of the charge, and the severity of the
consequences to the individuals concerned, procedural fairness requires that there be
proof rather than conjecture. The standard of “probabilities” requires the trier of fact
to stand back and make an overall assessment. The requirement of “clear and
convincing” evidence puts the focus more closely on the building blocks of the

evidence to ensure a rigorous testing.

In the Tribunal’s view, there need not be “clear and convincing evidence” on every
element of every allegation of corruption, but such “clear and convincing evidence”

as exists must point clearly to corruption. An assessment must then be made of which

“! Liman Caspian Oil BV and NCL Dutch Investment BV v. Republic of Kazakhstan, CSD Case No. ARB/O7/14,
Award, 22 June 2010, Exhibit CLA(B)-441, at para. 424:

... Itis not sufficient to present evidence which could possibly indicate that there might have been or
even probably was corruption. Rather Claimants have to prove corruption...{T]he issue is not one
of inference, and the Tribunal considers that Claimants have not met their burden of proof in this
regard.

elements of the alleged act of corruption have been established by clear and
convincing evidence, and which elements are left to reasonable inference, and on the
whole whether the alleged act of corruption is established to a standard higher than
the balance of probabilities but less than the criminal standard of beyond reasonable
doubt, although, of course proof beyond reasonable doubt would be conclusive. This
approach reflects the general proposition that the “graver the charge, the more

confidence there must be in the evidence relied on.”

6.3. Failure of the Respondent to Investigate and Prosecute Persons who Allegedly
Accepted Bribes

109. As the Claimants point out, the Respondent has brought no prosecutions against any

Government official said to be on the receiving end of the bribes. Nor is there before the
Tribunal any evidence of a serious criminal investigation of anyone other than the

principals of the Claimant, Mr. John Baldwin and Mr. Sean Scott.

110. Conviction of its own officials would not estop the Government from pursuing the

Claimants as bribe-givers.

111. However, in this case, the Tribunal finds it disturbing that no prosecutions have been

brought against any persons alleged to have accepted bribes, nor has there been evidence
of due diligence in any investigation. These omissions are relevant to the credibility of the

Government’s allegations, as will be seen.
6.3.1. First Allegation — Bribes to Obtain the 2009 Flat Tax Agreement

6.3.1.1. The Respondent’s Argument

112. The Claimants have repeatedly acknowledged that the Flat Tax Agreement (“FTA”)

was essential to the economic profitability of Savan Vegas. Mr. John Baldwin testified

in Singapore that the Claimants would not have built the casino without an FTA:

43 See Libananco v. Turkey (Exh. RLA-117), para. 125; Rompetrol v. Romania (Exh. RLA-233), para. 182;
both relying on the Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins in the Oil Platforms case, ICJ Reports 1996, at 856.

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 406 of 457

-39-

Q. And would you have built the Savan Vegas casino for $25 million, $30
million if that was the tax you had to pay, if the government refused to give

you a flat tax agreement?

A. No.*

113. It is alleged that to obtain the original 2009 FTA, a bribe of US $30,000 was paid to

Ms. Manivone or Mr. Khamphai, senior officials with the Government tax department,

through the Claimants’ intermediary or consultant, Madam Sengkeo.

114. The FTA was of great value to the Claimants as it limited most types of tax to a flat sum

of US $745,000 per year regardless of the profits made by the multi-million dollar casino

operation.
115. The chronology is as follows:

According to the Respondent, the sequence of dates, and the use of the daughter’s bank

account in lieu of Madam Sengkeo’s own account, raise “red flags”.

While the FTA had been agreed to in principle in December 2008, Mr. John Baldwin
testified that the deal was not done, because “we needed to get the flat tax agreement
reduced into a formal document at that specific time.”*° Accordingly, it would have
been quite understandable for the payment of a bribe to be delayed until October 2009
when the FTA was signed, as opposed to December 2008 when it was purportedly

approved in principle by the Government.

In cross-examination, Mr. John Baldwin denied any illegal payment to Madam
Sengkeo, but according to the Respondent, Mr. Baldwin’s explanation that the
reference to payment in October 2009 of US $30,000 to the “tax people” meant
payment to Madam Sengkeo for her own benefit rather than as a bribe for tax officials
is (according to the Respondent) manifestly absurd. In this respect, Mr. John Baldwin

testified as follows:

Q. Isn’t this a statement to the CFO of Sanum/Savan Vegas to pay a bribe of
$30,000 to a tax official in the Ministry of Finance?

A. No.

Q. How do you interpret it? What does it mean?

A. That the $30,000 success fee was supposed to be paid to Madam Sengkeo
and her tax people that were with her.

Q. She is “the Tax people”?

A. Yes.

Q. Did she work for the government then?

A. No.

Q. She didn’t? She’s not an employee of the Ministry of Finance?

*° Mr. John Baldwin testified as follows:

Q. What was the agreement’s substance? I mean, the agreement with Madam Sengkeo, what was the
substance of that agreement?

A. I believe — I — I don’t know specifically, but I believe that we needed to get the flat tax agreement
reduced into a formal document at that specific time, but Madam Sengkeo’s engagement went back
nearly a year, is my recollection, and that she helped, through that whole period, to get the flat tax
agreement.

Q. What was the agreement? Why was she getting 30,000? Why not 50,000?

A. Well, she agreed to take $30,000.

A. No."

119. The Respondent adds that the US $30,000 may have gone to Madam Sengkeo in the
first instance, but in the Respondent’s view, the coincidence of timing with Sanum’s
apparent need to ingratiate itself with Government officials is fatal to Mr. Baldwin’s

credibility.

6.3.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

120. The Claimant contends that payment of US $30,000 to Madam Sengkeo was a “success
fee” for obtaining the FTA where previous intermediaries had failed.** Mr. Baldwin

strongly denied any impropriety:

Q. Down at the bottom of the page it says:

“Dear Billy and Team, Mr Khamphai of the Tax Department and Mdm
Sengkeo had just informed us that Joe had picked up the flat tax document at
his office [meaning Mr Khamphai’s] since 9AM this morning ...

However, he has asked us to wire the agreed payment to Madam Sengkeo’s
account as followed ...”

And then they give the account number. So isn’t this interesting, that the day
that the flat tax agreement is delivered to your employee, he asked that
$30,000 is wired that day?

A. Well, my reading of this is that “he” is Joe.
Q. And who is he saying that the money should be paid to?
A. Madam Sengkeo.** (emphasis added)

5! Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 66, 1-15.

© Mr. Baldwin testified in his Second Witness Statement in the SIAC case of 8 June 2015 as follows:
15. The Government alleges that I authorized payments totaling US$30,000 to Madame Sengkeo
Phimmasone, as a bribe to obtain the flat tax agreement issued on 1 September 2009 for Savan Vegas.
This too is false. The payments represented a success fee to Madam Sengkeo for her efforts to
help Savan Vegas negotiate a Flat Tax Agreement with the Lao Government — a project on which
she had worked since at least July 2008.
16. Initially, it was the ST Group — then our local partner in Laos — that was responsible for obtaining
a flat tax agreement for Savan Vegas. However, it failed to do so, thus by mid-2008, we took it upon
ourselves to negotiate such an agreement with the Lao Government. In order to have local Lao
expertise to assist us, Savan Vegas offered a success fee to Madam Sengkeo to lobby for a
satisfactory Flat Tax Agreement for Savan Vegas. Madam Sengkeo was a partner of ST, which is
how I came to know her. I discovered that she had many high-level connections in the Lao
Government. This made her a natural choice for this consulting engagement. (emphasis added)

121. Mr. John Baldwin testified that there was no reason to bribe any Government employee
in September 2009 as the Prime Minister had already agreed to a flat tax agreement in
December 2008.*4

6.3.1.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

122. The Respondent’s case is speculative rather than substantial. Madam Sengkeo was in
the consulting business. Consultants are paid. While the Claimants never produced a
“consulting agreement” with Madam Sengkeo, the evidence is that it is not unusual for
consultants to insist on a success fee as part of their remuneration. The effort to obtain
a FTA was successful. It was likely worth millions of dollars to the Claimants in
reduced taxes. In that context, payment of US $30,000 in 2009 is not a disproportionate
“success fee”. Moreover, no one was prosecuted in this affair. Even if Madam Sengkeo
did not cooperate with the Government, why was her daughter (the owner of the bank
account) not investigated? What is the daughter’s explanation? The evidence of
corruption in this instance is neither clear nor convincing. The bribery allegation in
connection with the FTA is not established to the necessary standard for such a serious

charge.

6.3.2. Second Allegation — Bribes to Extend the Flat Tax Agreement After
Expiry of the 5-Year Term

6.3.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

123. On 18 March 2011, Savan Vegas submitted its proposal to extend the FTA, which was
due to expire on 31 December 2014. Six days later, on 24 March 2011, the Claimants
paid US $21,000 to Mr. Bouker Noutharath, a retired hospital worker from Olympia,
Washington State, United States of America, who had returned to live in Laos. He had

no experience as a “consultant” but had good contacts within the Government. On

™4 Mr. Baldwin testified:
Q. Would there be any reason to have to bribe anyone when the Prime Minister had already approved
your flat tax?
A. You know, there’s no reason to and, plus, obviously, the Prime Minister’s office was watching
this. The local tax people were watching this, the finance department’s watching this. This was a
significant project and lots of people were watching it and there’s no way. You just wouldn’t —
couldn’t happen.

4 March 2011, he was retained by Savan Vegas* as a consultant to lobby in favour of
an extension of the FTA. Mr. Baldwin says Mr. Bouker was promised a success fee
substantially in excess of US $ 21,000, but Mr. Bouker, who agreed to cooperate with

the Government, testified that:

I have seen the entry in the general ledger that I was sent $21,000 on March
24,2011. The entry says “prof fee re flat tax acceptance — Brian Nonthavet.”
RE-131. I remember that Sanum was concerned about extending a flat tax
agreement, but I was not involved in that issue. I was sent the $21,000 to
deliver it to a government person. I remember it was Mr. Paoa [of Savan
Vegas] who asked me to make this payment about the tax issue but I cannot
remember the name of the Government person who I gave this payment
too. (emphasis added)

but Mr. Baldwin testified he was “sure” this was not so:

6.3.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

125. Mr. Bouker received a legitimate consulting mandate. By e-mail dated 21 March 2011,

he requested US $21,000 as “an advance”. His bank records do not show a withdrawal
of US $21,000 but withdrawals of three different amounts on 28 March (US $9,500
cash), 30 March (US $9,000 to his son) and 4 April (US $2,135 cash). Mr. Bouker is a

dissatisfied former employee whose testimony is not credible.

6.3.2.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

126. There are inconsistencies in Mr. Bouker’s evidence and it is significant that he can

remember nothing about (or is otherwise unwilling to identify) “the Government
Person” to whom he said he handed US $21,000. There are too many loose ends to his
story. There is no evidence that Madam Manivone (the presumed recipient) or anyone
else was prosecuted. In the Tribunal’s view, the Respondent’s evidence does not
establish by clear and convincing evidence or on a balance of probabilities that a

US $21,000 bribe was offered by Mr. Bouker to any Government official as alleged.

6.3.3. Third Allegation — The Claimants Paid US $500,000 in Bribes in 2012 to
(i) Shut Down the E&Y Audit of Savan Vegas and (ii) to Cause the
Government to Shut Down the Thanaleng Slot Club to the Disadvantage
of ST Holdings

127. On 8 July 2012, Mr. Baldwin wired Sanum’s Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Clay

Crawford, that “Savan has an extraordinary expense of $500,000 this week. I’ve tell

you about it when we speak on the phone, but please think about our cash situation.”*?

128. Mr. Baldwin accepts that the sum of US $500,000 was subsequently sent to Vientiane

including US $300,000 cash in a backpack delivered to Madam Sengkeo by his personal

assistant, Bruce Douglas.

6.3.3.1. The E&Y Audit

Mr. Baldwin acknowledges ordering Mr. Douglas to fly to Vientiane with US $300,000
in cash. It is established that US $300,000 was subsequently deposited in Madam
Sengkeo’s bank account. She subsequently deposited US $30,000 in her bank account
in New York.

The Respondent’s allegation is that the balance of US $270,000 was paid by Madam
Sengkeo to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of the Savan Vegas which Mr.
Baldwin considered part of a Government move to get rid of Sanum and take over the

Claimants’ gambling assets without compensation.°!

the senior Lao Government officials who have intimate business and familial connections with ST.”

Madam Sengkeo has not been asked by the Claimants to repay the balance. The
US $30,000 deposit in New York was 10% of the US $300,000 transfer. Madam
Sengkeo was a “ten percenter”, and her receipt of US $30,000 indicates that bribes of
US $270,000 were paid.

132. The bribe succeeded, according to the Respondent. On 12 July 2012, Ernst & Young
(“E&Y”) was ordered by unidentified Government officials to stop work on its audit
of Savan Vegas.** The E&Y audit would have disclosed the Claimants’ illegal
activities (subsequently uncovered by a BDO audit after the Government ousted the
Claimants from the casino) including (the Government alleges) embezzlement and

money laundering.
6.3.3.1.2. The Claimant’s Argument

133. The Claimant says the US $300,000 was a “loan” to Madam Sengkeo. The New York
deposits are unrelated. Madam Sengkeo was closely involved with ST Holdings. There
had been a falling out. She thus had an “urgency” for funds when ST Holdings
malevolently cut off Madam Sengkeo’s regular source of income.® Mr. Baldwin was

a loyal friend.
6.3.3.1.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

134. Mr. Baldwin’s explanation of the US $300,000 payment to Madam Sengkeo is not
credible. It is clear on the evidence that Mr. Baldwin and his CFO, Mr. Clay Crawford,

were concerned about the threat to Sanum’s business posed by the E&Y audit. Mr.

A. ST had cut Madame Sengkeo off from any income from their investments, because she had
helped us over him, he had cut her off from any money and she lives primarily on money from
him. She needed money to pay bills on the hotel she was building. The USD 300,000 is a loan
to her. (emphasis added)

Baldwin had every incentive to influence the Government to call off the E&Y audit in
the summer of 2012. It is simply not plausible, as the Claimants argue, that the E&Y
audit was stopped because Government officials had concluded that E&Y had failed to
find incriminating evidence. If that were true, the obvious instructions from the

Government to E&Y would have been to keep digging, not to give up and down tools.

On the other hand, the Claimants had a powerful motive to stop the audit as Mr. Baldwin
and Mr. Crawford knew (and the Government merely suspected) of the existence of
financial skeletons in the Savan Vegas books later uncovered by the BDO audit. All in
all, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants got a senior Government official to stop
the audit and that the $270,000 was paid through Madam Sengkeo (i.e. $300,000 less

10%) to that Government person or persons.

That said, the Tribunal is troubled by the fact that the Government has apparently not
identified any bribe-rakers. The order to E&Y to stop the audit came as a surprise to
E&Y and must have been issued by a senior Government source, otherwise the audit
would have continued. The Respondent does not suggest that E&Y took the bribe but
E&Y must know who gave its auditors the order to stop work. The evidentiary trail
could then have been followed up the chain of command from the Government person
who gave the order to identify the person who authorized the order, who could then have
been required to provide the Government (and subsequently the Tribunal) with an

explanation for the stop work order.

The Respondent has not offered any explanation for this gap in the evidence. In the
circumstances, while the evidence of Mr. Baldwin that Madam Sengkeo required the
funds for her personal use is deeply unsatisfactory, so too is the Government’s apparent
failure even to attempt (so far the evidence is concerned) to get to the bottom of the
matter, not only potentially to punish the wrongdoers, but to provide solid evidence that

a bribe was given and taken by Government official(s) to stop the E&Y audit.

The Tribunal concludes that it is more probable than not that Madam Sengkeo was used
as a conduit to bribe Government officials to stop the E&Y audit, but that this
conclusion is not established to the higher standard of “clear and convincing evidence”.

The Tribunal is satisfied, however, on the lesser standard of a balance of probabilities,

that Mr. Baldwin involved the Claimants in serious financial illegalities in respect of

the halt of the E&Y audit.

6.3.3.2. Payment of About $200,000 in Bribes to Shut Down the
Thanaleng Slot Club

In 2012, the Claimants were experiencing tense relations with their then Laotian
partner, ST Holdings. In part, the tensions related to a profitable slot club at Thanaleng,
which ST Holdings agreed to joint venture with Sanum. The joint venture was to
commence at a future date awaiting the expiry of an earlier arrangement ST Holdings
had contracted with a different slot machine supplier. However, when the date for the

change-over arrived, ST Holdings refused to proceed with its deal with Sanum.

Mr. Baldwin is alleged to have then paid bribes to Government officials through a
“consultant”, Mr. Anousith Thepsimuong, in an effort to shut down the Thanaleng Slot
Club as a pressure tactic to force ST Holdings to negotiate a solution rather than

continue with litigation (which the Claimants ultimately lost in the Laotian Courts).
6.3.3.2.1. The Respondent’s Argument

On 28 July 2012, during the corporate struggle over the Thanaleng Slot Club, the
Claimants attempted to obtain leverage over ST Holdings by bribing Government
Ministries to shut down the Club. The money was channelled through Mr. Anousith.
The sum of US $190,000 was deposited in Mr. Anousith’s bank account on 11 July
2012 and a cash withdrawal of US $100,000 was made the following day.°

Mr. Baldwin testified that Mr. Anousith was paid to lobby “the National Assembly” but
this explanation is not credible. The National Assembly has no executive function.
Only a Government Minister would have operational authority to issue a stop order

against the Thanaleng Slot Club.

Mr. Baldwin acknowledged that he could not explain how or why the National

Assembly would get involved in such an executive action:

Q. You say that the National Assembly is going to suspend a licence, but did
he [the Deputy Prime Minister] ever explain or did you ever find out how the
National Assembly would actually do that?

A. No.”
6.3.3.2.2. The Claimant’s Argument

144. Mr. John Baldwin readily admits that in July 2012 he was doing what was possible to
get the Government to close the Thangaleng Slot Club®’, including by a written
submission to the country’s President. The Claimants say there is no reason to
disbelieve Mr. Baldwin’s evidence that he was told by the Deputy Prime Minister to
lobby the country’s National Assembly.

145. Mr. Baldwin denied that money was intended for a Government Minister:

Q. See, that brings us back to July and this $500,000 pot of money that we
have sitting in Vientiane in Madam Sengkeo’s bank account — her son-in-
law’s bank account. Isn’t it true that that money was there to stop the court
case from having a judgment — the money was there so you could get the slot
club shut down and negotiate with Mr Sithat?

67 Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, at p. 9,23-25 to p. 10, 1-4.

°S Mr. Baldwin testified that he wrote to President Choummaly Sayasone requesting the Government to shut down

the Thangaleng Slot Club:
“Sanum asks that the Government suspend that the slot machine licence at the Vientiane Friendship
Bridge. We believe that a temporary suspension will encourage the parties to negotiate and come to
terms so they can work together. Once the parties have reached an agreement, formed a joint venture
that is approved by the relevant ministries, and determine that they can operate the Vientiane...Bridge
Slot Club together, the licence would be reinstated. Until then, Sanum requests your assistance in
suspending the licence and allowing time and space to work [together] towards peace with [the] ST
Group.” Correct? So, as I said, you were trying to get a space to negotiate your way out of this
trouble with ST.
A. Yes.

Amended Transcript, 5 September 2018, p. 7, 19-25 to p. 8, 1-11.

° In re-examination, Mr. Baldwin testified about the National Assembly as follows:
MS DEITSCH-PEREZ: You spoke with Mr Branson about the Thanaleng lobbying. Can you tell us
where you first got the idea to lobby the assembly with respect to Thanaleng?
A. Yeah. I was having breakfast with Deputy Prime Minister Somsavath — we were having oatmeal
—and he —I said I got— I have to get — make peace with Sithat somehow and I — how do we do it and
he said, you know, it’s a tough row, because, you know, she’s joined at the hip with Bounnhang —
you know, with vice-president Vorachith, Bounnhang Vorachith, and he said I — there’s not very
many people that are going to be able to help you with this, you’ ve got to make peace with Sithat and
Vorachith, so I said, “Well, who can help me do that?”, and he said, “Well, two places — the politburo
and the National Assembly”, and he said the politburo, “That’s difficult, so I would suggest that you
reach out to the National Assembly.”

A. The money was specifically earmarked to do lobbying with the National
Assembly.

Q. Well, we just established that you have a good friend who is the fourth
most powerful person in the country. Wasn’t the money for him to shut
down the club so you could stop the court decision?

A. No.” (emphasis added)

146. The Claimants argue that there is no evidence that Mr. Anousith paid money to any
Government official. He received fees as a consultant to lobby the National Assembly
to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club. He was entitled to spend that money as he
wished. Laos is a cash economy. Payment of large amounts of cash in respect of

legitimate transactions is not unusual.’! Cash does not signal illegality.

 

. The Tribunal’s Analysis

147. Once again, the payment to Mr. Anousith is deeply suspicious. There is no
documentation of any consultancy. There is no explanation of the work for which
almost $200,000 were paid to him and deposited in his personal bank account. The
mandate to lobby the “National Assembly” seems far-fetched. Moreover, despite the
alleged payment of bribes, the Thanaleng Slot Club was not shut down. In the
circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to find “clear and convincing evidence” that a
bribe was made or even offered through Mr. Anousith. However, on the lower

“probabilities” standard, the Tribunal concludes that it is more likely than not that a

effort to advance the Claimants’ agenda at the Thanaleng Slot Club.

6.3.4. Fourth Allegation — The Claimants Arranged for a Further $575,000
Bribe to Madam Sengkeo to Prevent Her from Testifying in These
Proceedings

148. In 2014, when the initial phase of these proceedings was pending, the Government
sought to have Madam Sengkeo testify. To that end, she was provided with a written
assurance of immunity dated 7 May 2014, if she provided “information and documents

related to offering of bribery to government of [sic] official(s) who were performing

accounting audit activities at Savan Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd.”””

149. Ata pre-hearing conference on 14 May 2014, the Claimants (amongst other matters)
applied to the Tribunal to allow Mr. Baldwin to make a “personal loan” to Madam
Sengkeo of US $575,000.” Given the importance and sensitivity of Madam Sengkeo’s
evidence potentially to be given at the merits hearing, the Tribunal declined to give its

permission for a US $575,000 loan to her from Mr. Baldwin.

150. The initial hearing on the merits proceeded in Singapore in June 2014. Madam Sengkeo

did not attend to testify for the Government.

US $875,000 has been repaid except for US $15,000, leaving US $860,000 not

accounted for.7¢
6.3.4.2. The Claimant’s Argument

152. Mr. Baldwin had a long-standing business relationship with Madam Sengkeo which,
over time, developed into personal friendship. It was perfectly normal for Madam
Sengkeo to seek a personal loan and for Mr. Baldwin to arrange it. There is no evidence
whatsoever that the loan of US $575,000 or any part thereof was intended by Mr.
Baldwin, or understood by Madam Sengkeo,

 

an inducement not to testify. Madam
Sengkeo,”’ who now lives outside Laos, was being improperly pressured by the
Government to give false evidence to support its bribery and corruption case”® and it is
therefore quite understandable that she wished to avoid being a witness. Mr. Baldwin’s
explanation of the loans to Madam Sengkeo is not rebutted and there is no evidence

inconsistent with his version of events.

6.3.4.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The US $575,000 loan, coming on top of the previous loan of US $300,000, of which
only US $15,000 were repaid bristles with “red flags”. Mr. Baldwin clearly intended
to sidestep the Tribunal’s denial of permission by arranging for the US $575,000 loan
from a third party. Given Madam Sengkeo’s central role in dealings between the
Claimants and the Government over many years, her testimony would have shed crucial
light on the legality or illegality of many of the disbursements at issue in the

Respondent’s allegations.
Mr. John Baldwin testified:

Q. So when Mdm Sengkeo withdrew US$80,000 in cash on July 20, the
day before you went to visit your good friend, the Deputy Prime Minister,
what do you think she was going to do with those US dollars?

A. It was Mdm Sengkeo’s money to do what she wanted. She represented to

me that she needed the loan to pay construction bills.” (emphasis added)
It cannot be said that the bare payment of US $875,000 to Madam Sengkeo is “clear
and convincing evidence” of bribery. There is no evidence to contradict Mr. Baldwin’s
evidence of her need for funds. There are other possible explanations for their

disbursement.

On the whole, however, while the Tribunal is unable to find “clear and convincing
evidence” that the money was paid to Madam Sengkeo to bribe Government Ministers,
the Tribunal is nevertheless satisfied on the lower standard of balance of probabilities
that Mr. Baldwin and Madam Sengkeo were involved in channeling funds illicitly to
Lao Government officials, and further that she was paid to secure her loyalty and to

avoid her testifying on behalf of the Government, thereby obstructing justice.

The coincidence of the timing of “loans” of US $875,000 (less one repayment of
US $15,000) to Madam Sengkeo and the Claimants’ urgent need for Government
intervention on its behalf at critical junctures of its business (the termination of the E&Y
audit and the attempt to shut down the Thanaleng Slot Club), together with Madam

Sengkeo’s role as the Claimants’ principal go-between with the Government, which

Mr. Baldwin describes as a corrupt Government, compels an inference of Mr.
Baldwin’s unlawful conduct and through Mr. Baldwin, the culpability and bad faith of
both LHNV and Sanum, on whose behalf he acted.

The Government’s failure to track down bribe-takers or to provide a convincing
explanation of its efforts (even if on occasion unsuccessful) to do so, weighs against
the Government’s case, although the fact that the key witness, Madam Sengkeo, herself

refused to cooperate made the Government’s task more difficult.

Possibly the Government prefers to spare itself some embarrassment by declining to

put whatever it knows about “bribe-takers” into the record of the Tribunal.

Be that as it may be, the circumstances disclosed to the Tribunal do not rise to the level

of “clear and compelling evidence” of corruption.

However, the Tribunal’s conclusion that corruption of Government officials is
established to the lower standard of “balance of probabilities” is relevant to the issue

of the Claimants’ good faith, which is dealt with below.

Settlement with the Government. The allegedly genuine third-party offer to purchase
dated 14 April 2015 was from an entity called MaxGaming Consulting Services

writing that MaxGaming had funds available to complete the transaction and intended
to do so.*3 In testimony before the SIAC tribunal in January 2017, Angus Noble

the Government’s access to the books of Savan Vegas and records targeted by a
Government audit into alleged wrongdoing at Savan Vegas including money laundering

and embezzlement.
6.3.5.2. The Claimant’sArgument

165. While unrealistic, Mr. Noble genuinely believed he could orchestrate the purchase,

which he testified was, for him, “the chance of a lifetime.”
6.3.5.3. The Tribunal’s Analysis

166. The MaxGaming offer was indeed a sham, but bribery and corruption, as opposed to

fraud and chicanery, is not established.

6.3.6. Sixth Allegation — Miscellaneous Acts of Bribery and Corruption

167. Other allegations of bribery and corruption were made:

(a) offer of a US $7 million bribe to the Prime Minister of Laos for approval of a

licence to establish a casino in the capital city of Vientiane;§”

(b) a bribe of US $80,000 to the Governor of the Province of Champasak to approve
a slot club at Chong Mek;** and

(c) bribes totalling US $106,000 to Government officials to enable the opening and

continued operation of the Paksan Slot Club.*?

There is no “clear and convincing” evidence against the Claimants in support of any of

these additional claims of bribery and corruption.

168. As the Claimants point out, the Respondent has identified only two possible
Government bribe takers, namely Mr. Bounnong (but there is no indication he has been
investigated) and Madam Manivone. The evidence is that Madam Manivone was put
under investigation only after refusing to testify for the Respondent.°” The Claimants
state that on 29 May 2014, the Respondent promised its Rejoinder would reveal the

results of its investigation. It did not.

169. The Claimants complain, rightly, that the Respondent’s failure to offer any credible
explanation for not pursuing the investigation of its own employees, or indeed even to
attempt to identify the alleged bribe-takers, weighs against the credibility of these

miscellaneous allegations.”!

170. Nevertheless, in the Tribunal’s view, none of these additional allegations is supported

by sufficient evidence to warrant further inquiry or comment.

6.4. The Claimant’s Lack of Good Faith

171. Much of the Claimant’s case rests on the allegation that it proceeded in all respects in
good faith but was thwarted at every turn by a corrupt and devious Government acting
in bad faith. On the contrary, the evidence is clear that the Claimants dealt in bad faith
with the Government from the initial signing of the Paksong Hotel and Casino PDA
calling for a US $25 million hotel and casino to the financial irregularities in the
operation of the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino. The Claimants never intended to build

a US $25 million facility in Paksong. From the Claimants’ perspective, the benefit of

that “Mr. Kandil was an agent to Farargy” and that when he did learn about it, “I passed that to the
ing a full-fledged igation”, it is undi that Mr. Kandil was never
in Egypt in with this R bly, because Egypt has failed to
present the Tribunal with any information about the investigation requested by Minister Sultan, the
Tribunal does not know whether an investigation was conducted and, if so, whether the investigation
was closed because the prosecutor determined that Mr. Kandil was innocent, because of lack of
evidence, or because of complicity by other government officials. Nevertheless, given the fact that
the Egyptian government was made aware of this agreement by Minister Sultan but decided (for
whatever reasons) not to prosecute Mr. Kandil, the Tribunal is reluctant to immunize Egypt from
liability in this arbitration because it now alleges that the agreement with Mr. Kandil was illegal under
Egyptian law.

the Paksong PDA was a monopoly to block other more serious investors from offering
gambling facilities in Champaska and Salavan Provinces. Having obtained the
monopoly, the Claimants attempted to force the Government’s hand in relocating the
project to what, from the Government’s perspective, was a much less attractive site.
The bad faith continued through the disputes over the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino,
which was built but operated in defiance of Sanum’s reporting obligations to the
Government (and, when the books were eventually opened, revealed significant
financial irregularities). The bad faith continued further up to its recent efforts to deter
Madam Sengkeo’s appearance to testify at the merits proceeding and the sham

MaxGaming offer to purchase Savan Vegas in April of 2015.

The principle of good faith arises in investment treaty arbitrations in various contexts.
Tribunals, of course, regularly refer to Article 31(1) of the VCLT for the rule that
treaties shall be interpreted in good faith. The obligation extends to a duty of parties to
arbitrate in good faith.°? In Phoenix v. Czech Republic, the tribunal referred to
Phoenix’s “initiation and pursuit of this arbitration” as “an abuse of the system of
international ICSID investment arbitration.”°? (The tribunal found an abuse of rights
in that case by the “claimant’s creation of a legal fiction in order to gain access to an

international arbitration procedure to which it was not entitled.)

The Tribunal listened carefully to the testimony of Mr. John Baldwin and found him to
be an argumentative witness who preferred evasion to candour. Much of his testimony

was

 

imply not credible. He proceeded in bad faith from the outset in assuring the
Government that he intended to invest US $25 million at the Paksong site, which by his

own account was likely to be highly unprofitable.

Mr. Baldwin is the directing mind of both Claimant companies. His conduct throughout

was to advance their corporate interests. His bad faith conduct is their conduct. While

the Government’s conduct was at times aggressive and inappropriate in relation to the
Settlement (as documented, for example, in the Second Material Breach Application),
nevertheless the Claimant failed to establish that the Government acted in bad faith in

relation to the investors or the investments.

175. It is well established that the bad faith conduct of the investor is relevant to the grant of

relief under an investment treaty.°>

176. To summarize, the particular acts of bad faith by Mr. Baldwin on behalf of the Claimant

of most concern to the Tribunal are:

(a) misrepresentations made to the Government to obtain Paksong Hotel and Casino
PDA on the strength of a promise to make a US $25 million investment on the

site which, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants never intended to pursue;

(b

likely making illegal payments to Government officials to stop the E&Y audit of

the Savan Vegas Hotel and Casino;

(c

likely attempting to obstruct justice with the payment of US $875,000 to Madam
Sengkeo directed, as to US $575,000, to the obstruction of the due process of
this arbitration by paying Madam Sengkeo not to testify;

(d

attempting to mislead the Treaty Tribunals with the sham offer to purchase the

Savan Vegas from MaxGaming Consulting.”

177. As will be seen, the Claimant’s claims for expropriation fail on the facts. However,

having listened to Mr. Baldwin’s explanations over several hearings of his dealings

°S See UNCTAD Series on International Agreements III, Fair and Equitable Treatment (2012) at pp. 83-85:
Investor conduct has emerged as a relevant factor in the analysis of FET claims by arbitral tribunals. It
may be relevant in two ways. First, it may justify the measure taken against the investor by the
respondent country. Thus in Genin v. Estonia, the tribunal found that the Estonian national bank had
good reasons to revoke the operating license of the claimant's investment because the claimant had
failed to disclose relevant facts. In such cases, the adverse measure serves as a State’s reaction to, ora
sanction for the investor’s conduct...Fraud or misrepresentation on the part of an investor may
form the basis of a legitimate regulatory interference with its rights. In such cases, even the
outright termination of the investment may be justified, provided it is a proportionate response
to the investor’s conduct in light of the relevant domestic laws of the host State...in some situations,
an investor’s own conduct may be held to be a cause for the harm suffered.

% Although the MaxGaming incident occurred afer the date of Settlement, it was fully debated at the Hearing and

formed part of the corpus of the bad faith allegations.

with Laos, the Tribunal wishes to leave in no doubt its conclusion that Mr. Baldwin
and Sanum exhibited manifest bad faith in various efforts not only to manipulate the
Government to advance their gambling initiatives but, in the instance of Madam

Sengkeo, to manipulate the arbitration process itself.

THE CLAIM FOR EXPROPRIATION

7.1. Thanaleng Slot Club

71.1. Background

178. At its origin, the dispute underlying the Thanaleng claim is a contractual dispute

between two private parties, Sanum and ST. They had signed a Master Agreement on
30 May 2007, where they agreed “to negotiate and work towards entering into certain
joint ventures, represented by necessary agreements, which shall convey 60% of all 24
Party’s [ST] gaming businesses located in the country of Lao PDR ... This Agreement
is not intended to be a definitive agreement but only provides the Parties’ general
understandings of their relationship. The Parties agree to work together in good faith
to negotiate and finalize all necessary agreement to fully implement the concept and
terms set forth in this Agreement.”°’ The Respondent’s treatment of the Thanaleng
situation is part of the “totality of the facts” said by counsel for the Claimants to be

relevant to Sanum’s Treaty claims.°®

179. On 4 October 2008, Sanum and ST signed a Participation Agreement for Thanaleng

(“Participation Agreement”). Under this agreement, Sanum agreed to supply to ST
certain slot machines, on a “generated revenue sharing/participation basis.”°? This
agreement was meant to expire on 11 October 2011 when an existing contract of ST
with another supplier of slot machines expired. As explained by Sanum, “the expiration
of the Participation [Agreement] is only the end of percentage of profit distribution and
proportion of shareholding of each party in the business participation of the Slot Club,

which shifted from ST Group who used to receive 60% to receive 40% instead, and

Sanum who used to receive 40% to receive 60%, and at the same time (after 11 October
2011) there shall change or create a joint venture company of which Sanum holds 60%

and ST Group 40%.”!°

The controversy arose because Sanum and ST disagreed on whether the Master
Agreement remained in force and was valid and created binding obligations on the
parties, despite the expiration of the Participation Agreement. Was the Participation
Agreement a temporary agreement just to cover the period of time when other slot
machine supplier contracts were in place? Once those machine supplier contract expired
on 11 October 2011, did the Master Agreement and other agreements referenced above
remain in effect and control the contractual relationship between Sanum and the ST

Group?!°!

7.1.2. The Claimants’ Argument

The Claimants argue that they were deprived of their investment by flawed court
proceedings tainted by interference by the Respondent and without payment of
compensation. The Claimants summarize the measures for which they seek relief as
follows: “Beginning with premature termination of the OEDR proceedings on orders
from the Minister of Justice, and police participation in Sanum’s eviction from the
Thanaleng Club, and ending with manifestly unreasonable judgments rendered by the
courts of Laos, Respondent directed a result in favor of ST that deprived Sanum of its
entitlement to 60% of the revenues generated by its investment in the Thanaleng Slot
Club. The entire process was marred by manifest procedural defects, as well as
producing a result that was substantially unreasonable.”

At the closing of the Hearing, the Claimants confirmed that their Thanaleng claim in

this proceeding is not based on denial of justice but on the allegation that the totality of

Case 1:20-cv-00195-BLW Document 1 Filed 04/21/20 Page 430 of 457
-63-

the Respondent’s treatment substantially deprived the Claimants of the enjoyment of

their investment without the payment of compensation.!

183. The Claimants insist that Sanum did have an ownership interest in Thanaleng as
established in the Master Agreement, and invested millions of dollars in Thanaleng.
The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s interpretation of the Master Agreement is
contrary to the understanding and conduct of the parties to this agreement; it was a
binding agreement that contemplated future negotiations between Sanum and a would-
be supplier of slot machines and not between Sanum and ST. The fact that the Master
Agreement contemplated additional agreements does not detract from its binding
character. The Claimants point out that when ST sought the judicial annulment of the
Master Agreement, the document was described as the “basic agreement defining rights

in order to manage the relations between both parties.”!

184. The Claimants dispute the relevance of the cases relied on by the Respondent because
in the instant case the Respondent consistently treated the Master Agreement as legally
binding, “[o]nly Laos — for the first time in these proceedings — has ever characterized
the Master Agreement as an agreement to agree that did not generate legally enforceable
rights.”!0>

185. According to the Claimants, ST refused repeatedly to accept payment in exchange for
a contractually-required exchange of rights which did not extinguish the rights of
Sanum, “but merely constituted another breach by ST of its obligations to relinquish

control of the club to Sanum.”!%°

7.1.3. The Respondent’s Argument

186. The Respondent submits that the decision of the Lao Courts concerns a private dispute
between ST and Sanum and there was nothing untoward in the various judicial
proceedings in Laos. According to the Respondent, the Claimant has committed abuse

of process by pursuing contradictory claims in parallel arbitrations against Laos based

on the same treaties and the same economic interests. In this respect the Respondent,

at the Hearing, recounted the timeline of the procedure:

We have in July 2012 the decision of the Lao Commercial Court.
Immediately, before they exhausted their local remedies, which they are
required to do under international law, they filed this arbitration alleging that
the Thanaleng court decision was a denial of justice and an expropriation.
Later they amended to say it’s an expropriation.

In June 2015, there was a decision by the LHNV tribunal on the first material,
the breach application. They didn’t prevail.

Three months later, they filed the SIAC arbitration against ST on the same
contracts, alleging that the Lao court proceedings had no meaning, they were
just -- how would one say it?

One would say their view of the Lao court proceedings in Singapore was that
they were a voluntary mediation. If you don’t like the result of a mediation,
you withdraw and you go to court. That’s how they’re treating the Lao court
proceeding when they go to Singapore: it didn’t matter, is it wasn’t definitive.
So, they get an ST SIAC Award in August 2016. They filed it in the Lao
courts in 2017.

Then the Lao courts refused to enforce it in August 2017. On 1 September
2017, they filed a denial of justice claim in the new ICSID arbitration. Then
in December 2017, the second material breach application was granted,
reinstating this tribunal to hear the Thanaleng case again.

So they have these conflicting — once you issued the second material breach
decision, it revived these two treaty claims that are in conflict with the treaty
claims they had filed in September 2017.'”

187. The Respondent further explained:

Sanum said in these cases that the 26 July 2012 decision of the court was
expropriation number one. They said their rights were expropriated, that’s
the claim here, and they filed the first BIT claims in August 2012.

But the second BIT arbitration says that the date of expropriation was August
2017 when the Lao courts refused to enforce the SIAC award, and that’s the
subject of the second BIT arbitration.

So you have these inconsistent claims made by the same claimant under the

same treaties, based on the same facts. We say that’s an abuse of process.‘

7.1.4. The Tribunal’s Analysis

188. The Thanaleng claim relates to a dispute between the Claimants and ST. It concerns

the Respondent only to the extent of the Respondent’s alleged interference in court

‘07 Amended Transcript, 3 September 2018, p. 143, 6-25 to p. 144, 1-17.

-65-

proceedings, and only if its actions could be characterized as a violation of international

law.

189. The Claimants have placed the weight of their argument on the alleged interference of
the Respondent in the Lao Commercial Court proceedings in 2012. But the dispute
resolution provision in the Master Agreement (Article 2.10)'” provides for a four-stage
mechanism. At the fourth stage, after a party to the Master Agreement has exhausted
the remedies available in the Lao Courts, it may submit the dispute to arbitration if it is
unsatisfied with the result without the need to demonstrate a breach of due process or

other violations in the conduct of the court proceedings.

190. The Claimants also explained that the four-step mechanism provided for in the Master
Agreement has been found to violate Lao law and, therefore, “any award rendered under
the mechanism that differed from the judgment of the Lao Courts would [not] be
enforceable in Laos (the only country where the ST’s assets are now located) as a matter
of Lao public policy.’””!!°

191. Sanum has exercised in full the four levels of remedies provided for in the Master
Agreement. After exhausting its recourse to the Lao Courts, Sanum initiated the SIAC
arbitration in 2015. In 2016, the SIAC tribunal awarded Sanum the $200 million it had

claimed.

192. The Claimants say that they have not been able to enforce the SIAC award and link the
inability to enforce it to the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao

Commercial Court in 2012. As explained by the Claimants at the Hearing:

The problem is, looking at the totality of the circumstances, the Lao Court of
Appeals — and that’s the highest level in an enforcement proceeding — won’t

109 “If any dispute shall arise, the Parties agree to conduct an amicable negotiation. If such dispute cannot be
settled by mediation, the Parties may submit such disputes to the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization
or Courts of the Lao PDR according to the provision and law of Lao PDR in accordance with this Agreement. All
proceedings of the arbitration shall be conducted in Lao and English languages.

Before settlement by the arbitrator under the Rules of the Resolution of Economic Dispute Organization, the
Parties shall use all efforts to assist the dispute resolution in accordance with the laws of Lao PDR.

If one of the Parties is unsatisfied with the results of the above procedure, the Parties shall mediate and, if
necessary, arbitrate such dispute using internationally recognized mediation/arbitration company in Macao, SAR
PRC.” Master Agreement, C(B)-001.

allow enforcement of the SIAC award and so the original action that the
government took in ramming the original decision through to benefit ST and
forcing claimants to have to go to that additional stage, to have to go to the
fourth stage, that allowed ST the time to move all of its assets back into Laos
and put the claimants in a position where they would be dependent on going
to Laos to enforce the award against ST where the same thing, or worse, could
happen. So, there was a distinct consequence at the stage of the measure
relating to the Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.

Even if the claimant could then go on to the SIAC proceeding, which it did,
there was still a consequence and there was still harm caused by that action,
because being able to go to the fourth tier, that didn’t right the ship. That
didn’t enable Sanum to have a clear path to recovery. So there’s still
consequences to what the government did in 2012.”""!

193. The Claimants want to skip over the fact that Sanum has a valid arbitral award against a

private party in which it was awarded 200 million dollars after it exhausted the remedies

in the Lao Courts for the alleged interference of the Respondent in the Lao Commercial

Court back in 2012. The alleged inability to enforce the award is not before this Tribunal

and it has not been proven by the Claimants that “there was a distinct consequence [of

the Government’s alleged interference] at the stage of the measure relating to the

Thanaleng proceeding in 2012.”!!?

There is simply no persuasive evidence that the

alleged interference of the Respondent in the proceeding of a lower court interfered with

the steps taken by the Claimants to exercise their rights under the Master Agreement and,

in particular, their recourse to SIAC arbitration.

194. The Claimants say their claim in the SIAC arbitration was not for the full amount of the

value lost in Thanaleng. The Claimants explained why Sanum capped its claim for

damages:

in part because ST did not appear and that raised the issue of whether or not
they were going to hide assets, such that it was fruitless to seek the full value
of Thanaleng. The full value of Thanaleng, I know we’re bifurcated so we’re
not going to talk very much about those kind of things, but the full value of
Thanaleng is more than 400 million in order to not have the fees, and in light
of the practical recognition that ST was likely hiding its assets, we capped the
SIAC claim at 200 million. So it won’t be possible to recover the full amount
from ST to cover the cost of the damage that the government caused by
directing the Thanaleng case in Laos.''*

195. The Respondent is not responsible for the decision of the Claimants to self-limit the
amount of the claim against ST. The evidence does not establish any improper

interference by the Respondent in the court proceedings.

196. In sum, the Tribunal concludes that the claim for expropriation in respect of the

Thanaleng investment lacks any merit.

7.2. Paksong Vegas Hotel and Casino
7.2.1. Background

197. On 10 August 2007, a Project Development Agreement was concluded between Lao
PDR, and Sanum, the Laotian company Nouansavanh Construction Co. Ltd., and Mr.
Sittixay Xaysana for the development of the Paksong casino (“Paksong PDA”). Under
the Paksong PDA, a Laotian entity, Paksong Vegas and Casino Co. Ltd., was set up
with Lao PDR holding 20%, Sanum 60% and the ST entities 20%. The Paksong PDA
required the Company to build and operate a $25 million hotel casino and golf resort in

the Paksong district of Champasak Province.

7.2.2. Location of Paksong
198. As explained by the Claimants, the location was challenging:

“The challenges were both logistical and commercial. Logistically, Paksong’s
location meant that transportation of construction materials would be more
costly than at the Savan Vegas site, as access to the site was more difficult
and time consuming, and that other construction costs would be significantly
higher than those of Savan Vegas. Also, the concession was located on the
side of a large hill which precluded the building of simple, large buildings to
house the hotel and casino and other amenities. Commercially, since Paksong
was not located on the border with Thailand or even in a population center in
Laos that was easy to access, it lacked a readily identifiable customer base.
The challenges of attracting customers made it difficult to identify the optimal
type of facility to construct on the site.”!'*

(Respondent’s Opening Submission, Slide 96)

199. Mr. Baldwin testified about the problem posed by Paksong’s distance from the Thai
border:

Another challenge posed by Paksong Vegas had to do with its customer base.
Because Lao citizens generally are restricted from playing table games, the
customer base for our casinos consists largely of Thai citizens who live in
Northeastern Thailand. However, because Paksong Vegas would be located
deep in Laos’s interior, without easy access to the border, we were concerned
that it would be difficult to attract customers to the casino. |'*

200. These challenges notwithstanding, Mr. John Baldwin testified that the Paksong project
package “came with very valuable benefits. Chief among these were the monopoly
gaming rights in Champasak and Salavan Provinces granted to Paksong Vegas under
the PDA.”!!¢

201. Due to the challenges posed by the site, on 31 March 2008, Paksong Vegas proposed
to the provincial government, inter alia, to move the entire project to the area near
Chong Mek. On 29 April 2008, the proposal was rejected by the provincial

government.

202. On 21 August 2008, the office of the Prime Minister advised that Paksong Vegas was
to return Paksong and pursue only the project at Khone Phapheng (where the

Government also favoured development) together with other interested parties. The

notice from the Champasak Provincial Office requested Sanum “to follow the
agreements already reached by higher authority and only do the work at Kilometer 30
in Paksong. (According to instructions from the Government Secretariat, if the
company cannot comply, then the project must be placed on hold for now).”!!7 The
notice added that “[i]t is not approved to open casino branches in Paksong and other
places, only at Khone Phapheng. The Paksong land (Kilometer 30) will be returned to

the Government.”!!*

On 23 October 2008, the Prime Minister’s Office issued a notice, purporting to strip
Paksong Vegas of its monopoly rights. The Prime Minister’s Office also reiterated that
Yingsoksay, the operator of the existing hotel and resort in the area, could look for other
foreign investors to develop Khone Phapheng; Paksong Vegas could participate in that
development if it chose to do so, but either way, according to the Prime Minister’s
Office, it no longer had the exclusive right to do so. Further, on 19 December 2008,
Champasak provincial authorities instructed Paksong Vegas to return the land
concession it had been granted so it could be used for “another purpose,” referencing

the Prime Minister’s 21 August 2008 notice.!!?

On 30 January 2009, a meeting was held in the MPI’s offices. It was attended by all
Lao agencies concerned and Paksong Vegas. The Paksong Vegas and Casino
Development Project and the Khone Phapheng Entertainment Complex Project

Development were discussed. The Tribunal will re-visit this meeting in its analysis.

On 27 April 2010, the MPI terminated the PDA because Paksong Vegas had not signed
a land concession agreement in accordance with Article 4 of the PDA, and construction
on the project had been delayed for more than two years, which affected the “social-
economic development plan of Champasak province.”!”° Termination of the PDA was

re-affirmed by the Respondent on 10 April 2012.

7.2.3. The Claimant’s Argument

206.

The dispute concerns the termination of the Paksong PDA and the revocation of the

concomitant land concession. For the Claimant, the actions of the Respondent

constitute an expropriation under Article 4 of the BIT. The Claimant argues that the

Respondent ignores the evidence that Lao authorities had ordered Sanum to cease

construction and two years later without prior notice cancelled the PDA on grounds of

failing to develop the land.

207.

The Claimant questions the Respondent’s defence to the expropriation claim. First,

there is no contemporaneous evidence that Sanum repudiated the PDA when it

proposed to relocate. Second, the Respondent ignores the work done by Sanum.!?!

Third, the contention that Sanum lacked necessary funds has never been raised before,

and the Respondent has not followed the PDA’s procedures to establish “financial

inability”. Fourth, cancellation to avoid the Claimant’s monopoly rights does not

absolve the Respondent from the claim of expropriation.

7.2.4. The Respondent’s Argument

208.

The Respondent claims that Sanum was not a ready, willing and able investor for the

Paksong project. According to the Respondent, Sanum forfeited the concession

because the location was not commercially acceptable. The Respondent explains that

Paksong and Savannakhet were linked; they were part of a bargain: whoever would

develop Savannakhet, an excellent commercial site, must also develop the less

attractive Paksong. According to the Respondent, Paksong is in the Champasak

province and, in addition to Paksong, two other locations in that province are mentioned

in the record: Chong Mek and Khonephapheng. The Respondent contends that Sanum

was only interested in Chong Mek, but not in either of the other sites. The provincial

government was keen to develop the remote areas while Sanum was interested in more

profitable sites; the interests of Sanum as a commercial developer and of the provincial

government were not aligned.

-71-

The Respondent argues that it is impossible to read into the Paksong PDA the right
claimed by Sanum to build other casinos or slot clubs. The PDA gives Sanum the
exclusive right to operate in the provinces covered by the PDA, which simply means
“no one else would be allowed to build a casino or slot club in those provinces.”!?? The
Respondent affirms that there has never been an additional casino or slot club. There
has not been expropriation of “monopoly rights”.'2> According to the Respondent, Mr.
Baldwin’s assertion that Sanum could not build at Paksong because the Government
“would no longer respect its monopoly rights” is frivolous. Mr. Baldwin refused to
develop Paksong because he did not want to lose money on a project doomed to

commercial failure.”!?4

7.2.5. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The issues to be addressed by the Tribunal may be formulated as follows: Was the act
of termination of the PDA an expropriatory measure or the exercise by the Respondent
of its right to terminate the PDA for failure of Paksong Vegas to meet its obligations?
In addition, what weight should be given to the allegation that the procedure for

termination provided for in Article 19 of the PDA was not followed?

First of all, what were the rights of Sanum in Paksong Vegas? In its Reply, the Claimant
notes that “Laos does not dispute that Claimant possessed property rights through
Paksong Vegas that could be subject to expropriation, most notably, the valuable
monopoly rights in Champasak Province acquired pursuant to the Paksong Vegas
PDA.”!?5 The Respondent did not question this understanding of the Claimant in the
Rejoinder or the Opening Statement at the Hearing. However, at the closing, the
Respondent argued that the Claimant had no cognizable property right based on the
definition of the term “Land Map” in the PDA.'?° This definition explains that the seal
of the Government Agency affixed to the land lease demonstrates “conclusively that

the right to lease that piece of land belongs to the company.”!?’ But the company as

defined in the PDA means the parties to the Paksong PDA, one of which is the Claimant.

212. Second, what is the extent of Paksong Vegas’s monopoly rights in Champasak
province? As confirmed by Mr. Baldwin’s testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Baldwin
wanted to develop a site at Chong Mek. He agreed that the monopoly rights were limited
to the Paksong development area and did not include Chong Mek, “unless the
government agreed to modify this. The way it’s written right now, it does not include
Chong Mek but it doesn’t say we can’t ask for modifications.”!?* Mr. Baldwin also
confirmed that he really knew that the Government policy was not to approve a move

to Chong Mek.

213. Third, did Paksong Vegas forfeit its rights when the Claimant informed the Lao
Government that it did not wish to pursue the project at Paksong? The Claimant has
explained that the proposal of 31 March 2008 remained subject to Government
approval. On 29 April 2018, the Government rejected the proposal and instructed
Sanum to “follow the agreements already reached by higher authority and only do the
work at Kilometer 30 in Paksong. (According to instructions from the Government
Secretariat, if the company cannot comply then the project must be placed on hold for

now).”!29

214. The terms of the notice rejecting the proposal affirm that at the time, the Government’s
intention was not to terminate the PDA, but to request that the existing agreements be
respected, and only if the company could not comply, to stop the project for the time
being. The Respondent has argued the Claimant’s forfeiture of the rights of Paksong
Vegas in this proceeding in 2014, six years later. If this would have been the case, it

would not have been necessary for the Government to terminate the PDA in 2010.

215. Was the Respondent entitled to terminate the PDA in 2010? Sanum has argued that it

had been asked to stop work at Paksong and that was the only reason why the work was

behind. However, the minutes of the meeting held on 30 January 2009 show that the
meeting chair “cited many deficiencies of the company [Paksong Vegas] in its
performance of the contract.”!°° More significantly, among the unanimous resolutions
reached at this meeting, Paksong Vegas accepted that “in the past it has not carried out
the Paksong Vegas project as scheduled in the contract and as it was presented to the
Province.”!3! According to the minutes: “The meeting agreed to have Paksong Vegas
and Casino Co., Ltd. to follow instructions in Lao Government Notice No. 1469/GS,
dated 21 August 2008 and Notice No. 1887/GS, dated 23 October 2008. The main
points of discussion were: not to approve opening branches of the Casino in Paksong
and other areas, but to allow casino operations only in Khone Phapheng Development
Project. The land in Paksong Development Project (KM30) is to be returned to the
Government. No exclusive rights are to be granted, and the agreement with Paksong

9132

Vegas and Casino Co., Ltd is to be revised.

The Tribunal observes that the Claimant admitted, at the meeting of 30 January 2009,
that “it has not carried out the Paksong Vegas project as scheduled in the contract and
as it was presented to the Province.” Mr. Baldwin also testified at the Hearing that no
contract to build a $25 million five-star hotel with a casino and nightclub was ever
signed. !33

What is the significance of the lack of notice by the Respondent to Paksong Vegas
under Article 19 of the PDA? According to Article 19, notice was required indicating
the non-performance and giving 90 days to correct it. It is undisputed that the
Respondent did not give notice to Paksong Vegas of non-performance of the obligations
under the PDA. But Paksong Vegas had not made the investment it had promised in
the PDA within the expected timeframe as admitted by Paksong Vegas. It had also
agreed at the meeting of January 30, 2009 to operate a casino in Khone Phapheng, and
“{a]s for the Paksong project, the company is happy to follow the government’s

guidance.”'*4 As recorded in the same meeting, the Government’s guidance was to

return the land to the Government.!35_ In the circumstances, the Tribunal finds there
was no need for Paksong Vegas to be further notified. The Respondent had been clear
in that the PDA would need to be revised and Sanum had agreed to revise it. The
Claimant had not complied with the terms of the PDA and could not reasonably keep
its monopoly rights indefinitely while at the same time maintaining that the
development of Paksong was a losing proposition not worth a US $25 million
investment. Mr. Baldwin confirmed at the Hearing that no contract to build a $25

million five-star hotel with a casino and nightclub was ever signed.'*°

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant lost its rights under the PDA because it breached
its terms and, by its own admission, the Paksong site could not be developed. This
Claimant’s admission contradicts its argument that work was being done and, if not
done, was due to the Government order to stop the work. The loss of Paksong was not
an expropriation, it was termination for breach of contract. The monopoly rights
cherished by Sanum had a concomitant obligation to invest, which Sanum admits it did

not fulfil.

7.3. Paksan Slot Club
7.3.1. Background

As told by Sanum and not disputed by the Respondent, the relevant facts are that “[s]oon
after Sanum agreed to partner with ST, it discovered that there was an existing slot club
in operation in the Paksan district of Bolikhamxay Province — one of the provinces in
which Savan Vegas has the exclusive right to operate. To enforce that exclusive right,
ST asked the Government of Bolikhamxay Province to shut down the club, and it did
so.”!37 The existence of the slot club led Savan Vegas to open its own club at the same

location, the Paksan Hotel.

The Ministry of Information and Culture (“MIC”) granted Savan Vegas a one-year
license to operate a slot club in the Bolikhamxay Province on 24 October 2007. The
MIC renewed the license on 26 November 2008.

After the lease of the former club expired in October 2008, Savan Vegas signed its own
lease on 25 December 2008 and refurbished the space in the Paksan Hotel formerly
occupied by the slot club. The club re-opened on 25 October 2009 and the MIC

renewed the slot license for another year on 27 October 2009.

On 18 February 2010, the Prime Minister’s Office ordered the slot club license to be
cancelled: “The authorization to open an electronic gaming club granted to Savan
Vegas Ltd. by the Information and Culture Department of Bolikhamxay Province is not
in accordance with regulations in that it exceeds the authority of that office. Therefore,
you should stop operation of electronic gaming at Paksan Hotel. Further, the company

is no longer authorized to erect an advertising billboard in Bolikhamxay Province.”!°*

The license was not renewed in 2010. On 11 March 2011, the Government ordered the
MIC and the provincial Governor to close the club within three days. The club closed
on 13 March 2011. Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime Minister to re-open
the club. The petition was denied on 19 May 2011 and Savan Vegas was ordered to

comply with Notice No. 305.

7.3.2. The Claimant’s Argument

The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s closure of the Paksan slot club constitutes
an unlawful taking. In the Statement of Claim, the Claimant attributes the closure to
the dissatisfaction of ST with the Claimant on whether revenues of the Paksan slot club
and the concomitant tax obligations should be consolidated with those of Savan Vegas.
As told by the Claimant, “[i]n a meeting they [ST] had with Sanum in the fall of 2010,
ST demanded they be paid 30% of Paksan’s gaming revenues, regardless of what any
agreement said. If Sanum did not agree, ST would have the club shut down ... ST then

proceeded to make good on their threat. Sanum soon learned that ST had convinced

officials at the MIC to issue a notice instructing Savan Vegas to close the Paksan

club.”159

The Claimant also disputes the Respondent’s contention that most patrons were Lao
people because there is no bridge at Paksan. The Claimant points out that there is a
ferry to cross to and from Thailand. Secondly, this argument was not used to close the
club as it is evident in the minutes of the Government meeting held on 11 March 2011
where the closure was decided.'4° The minutes only refer to Notices No. 305 and
470/MCD that Savan Vegas claims not to have seen earlier. Indeed, in the case of

Notice No. 305, Savan Vegas affirms that it became aware of it in this arbitration.

The Claimant points out that, “prior to filing its Statement of Defense in this arbitration,
Laos had never asserted that the closure of Paksan was justified by non-compliance
with the Savan Vegas PDA, failure to obtain a separate Foreign Investment License, or
the MIC’s supposed lack of authority to issue slot club licenses. In fact, Savan Vegas
was never made aware of the existence of Notice No. 1957 until this arbitration.”!*!

Furthermore, the Claimant recalls that the Respondent withdrew the accusing witness

statement on Lao people being allowed to gamble at the Paksan Hotel.

The Claimant further argues that, “although Paksan’s license had expired at the time of
the club’s closure, by permitting the club to continue operating without a license and
by assuring Savan Vegas that its license was in the process of being renewed, the

Government de facto extended Sanum’s rights in the Paksan investment.”!4?

7.3.3. The Respondent’s Argument
In the Reply, the Claimant questions the merit of

Laos’s attempt to rely on a number of Government instruments that it claims
deprived the MIC of authority to issue slot club licenses. Notice No.1957,
issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on 4 November 2008, did not, as Laos
now claims, require that all slot club licenses be issued by the Prime
Minister’s Office rather than by the MIC. Critically, Notice No. 1957 is titled
‘Solution for the slot machine business issues in Khammouan Province and

Vientiane City’, and it is addressed only to the governors of those areas, as
well as the MIC, the MPI, and the Minister of Public Security. Thus, on its
face, it has no application to Bolikhamxay Province, where the Paksan slot
club was located. Moreover, Notice No. 1957 provides that ‘the Government’,
and not just the Prime Minister’s Office, has the right to issue slot club
licenses. The MIC is undoubtedly part of the Lao Government. As to Notice
No. 545, issued by the Prime Minister in March 2008, and now claimed by
Laos to ‘have barred new casinos and slot clubs’, this was issued after Paksan
received its first operating license in 2007.'%

229. In the Rejoinder, the Respondent affirms that a “de facto” license cannot be
expropriated “when the real one year license had expired.”'44 The Respondent admits
that it is the first time that it argues that Savan Vegas was not authorized to operate a
slot club in Paksan. The Respondent states: “‘it is the first time, but the position is
correct in law. A party operating outside the terms of its license and concession
a145

agreement cannot claim an illegal expropriation of an illegal business.

7.3.4. The Tribunal’s Analysis

230. A first issue to be addressed by the Tribunal is the disputed meaning of monopoly in
the PDA. Article 9 reads as follows:

The Company has been granted monopoly rights for its casino business
operation only with the condition that the Government shall not approve and
grant any other parties or entities who put up their applications for the
operation of certain casino business in the two neighboring provinces close to
the project development zone of the Company, namely Salavan and
Champasak throughout the concession period of 50 years.

However, should there have any applications submitted by any parties or
entities, all those shall be made through the consent and approval of both the
government and the authorized investors who have management rights.”"4°

231. The Claimant’s argument that Savan Vegas’ foreign investment license permitted
Savan Vegas to operate gambling facilities in all three provinces where it had monopoly
finds no support in the terms of the PDA. The Claimant and ST in fact recognized the

need to have a specific slot license at Paksan and applied for its renewal year after year.

On the other hand, the argument of the Respondent that the Paksan operation was illegal
under the Law on Investment Promotion may be correct in law, as affirmed by the
Respondent in the Rejoinder,'*” but of doubtful persuasiveness when the MIC had

issued the Paksan slot club a license three times during the period 2007-2009.

232. The Respondent has argued that the license was terminated in February 2010 and that
the Claimant had operated the Paksan slot club without a license for about a year. On
the other hand, the Claimant has affirmed that it was not aware of Notice No. 305 of
18 February 2010.'** Irrespective of whether the license was terminated by order of the
Prime Minister’s Office, it is undisputed that the Paksan slot club continued to operate
beyond the term of its license. For the Tribunal, the key fact is that the license granted
in 2009 had expired in October 2010 and had not been renewed. Monopoly rights kept
competitors out but did not entitle Savan Vegas to establish and operate other gambling
facilities unless those other facilities were specifically authorized. The Claimant has
not shown that Savan Vegas had a right to the license’s renewal or even that it attempted

to renew the license.

233. At the time of the Paksan slot club’s closure, the club was operating without a license
and there is no documentary evidence that the Respondent had created any legitimate
expectation in the Claimant that the license would be renewed or that it may operate de
facto as if it had a license. The Claimant’s argument about a de facto license begs the
question of why Sanum had applied for the license’s renewal in the preceding years.
The Tribunal concludes that the license expired on its own terms and had terminated

when the slot club was ordered to be closed.

7.4. Thakhet Casino and Hotel Resort
7.4.1. Background

234. In 2010, Sanum started negotiations with the Committee for the Laos-Thailand
Friendship Bridge III Economic Zone Development (the “SEZ” and the “SEZ

Committee”) for a land concession at the foot of a planned bridge to cross the Mekong

River. The negotiations resulted in a MOU between Sanum and the SEZ Committee
dated 20 October 2010. The MOU contemplated a land concession to Sanum of about
90 hectares in the SEZ, payment by Sanum of $900,000 to allow the provincial
government to compensate individuals occupying the land, and $400,000 to be paid
upon signature of the MOU. The MOU required Sanum to sign a land concession
within 30 days and secure all necessary approvals from the central and local

governments within one year prior to building on the concession land.

On 4 February 2011, Savan Vegas submitted a proposal for a slot club to the Governor
of the Khammouane Province and the MIC. The proposal was supported by the
Governor and, on 21 February 2011, the MIC approved the Savan Vegas’s Welcome

Center and Slot Club. Shortly thereafter, on 2 March 2011, the Prime Minister’s Office

 

directed the MIC to revoke its approval because slot club licenses may only be issued
“by the Government”, which was interpreted by the Prime Minister to mean the Prime
Minister’s Office.'49 On 29 March 2011, Sanum and Savan Vegas petitioned the Prime
Minister’s Office to grant permission to open the Welcome Center and Slot Club in the

SEZ. The petition was rejected in October 2011.

7.4.2. The Claimant’s Argument

According to the Claimant, the SEZ Committee had been negotiating with Sanum a
PDA and a land concession for the project, and by the end of 2011 the negotiations
were near completion. But then, “the Government sent Sanum a substantially revised
PDA, which removed approximately 16 hectares from the land that the SEZ Committee
had previously committed to grant Sanum in the MOU.” The Claimant affirms that the
removal of these 16 hectares compromised the feasibility of the project because they

fronted Highway 13 and the access road to the bridge.

colored in yellow)

According to the Claimant, the map above, which was appended to the 2010 MOU,
showed Sanum’s Highway 13 Frontage. However, the Respondent notes that Sanum
never made an application for a license or PDA to the MPI for the Thakhet
development, as required by the Law on Investment Protection. Instead, on 4 February
2011, Savan Vegas applied to the MIC for a license for a small slot club. At the time,
because of the order to close Paksan, Savan Vegas should have been aware that the
MIC had no authority to approve gambling licenses. In the application, Savan Vegas
referred to the MOU and attached the PDA, under which Savan Vegas affirmed that it
had the right to operate in three provinces. On 21 February 2011, the MIC authorized
gambling in Thakhet. On 2 March 2011, the Prime Minister revoked the authorization
and re-affirmed this decision on 7 October 2011 in view of the further request of Savan

Vegas on 29 March 2011. At the request of Sanum, the president of Sanum met with

-81-

relevant ministries on 25 November 2011, and again it was reiterated to Sanum that the

authorization to operate slot machines in Khammouane Province was illegal.

The Claimant in the Reply points out that the SEZ Committee was appointed by the
central Government, that the Government specifically instructed Sanum to negotiate
the PDA and land concession agreement with the SEZ Committee, and that the 30 days
to sign the land concession run as from approval by the SEZ Committee of a feasibility
study, master plan, social-economic and environmental impact study. The Claimant
contends that it submitted these documents, but negotiations of the PDA fell apart
because of the removal of the 16 key hectares. The Claimant points out the changing
reasons adduced by the Government to justify the removal of those hectares. First, the
Respondent had said that there was a holdout landowner who wanted more money;

later, it argued that the 16 hectares were never included in the concession.

The Claimant affirms that at the time it was not aware of Notice No. 305, and that, in
any case, this Notice does not deprive the MIC of its authority to issue slot licenses.
According to the Claimant, Savan Vegas reasonably believed that the MIC was the
relevant authority to which it should direct its application. This understanding was
supported by Respondent’s contemporaneous actions. For example, the Khammouane
Governor wrote to the MIC a letter of support on the province’s behalf. The MIC

approved the application on 21 February 2011.'5°

7.4.3. The Respondent’s Argument

The Respondent contends that the Claimant has not been able to rebut the Respondent’s
position that Sanum never obtained a license, a concession or a PDA from the
Respondent. The Respondent points out that in the Reply, the Claimant admits that the
parties had not reached agreement on whether the 16 hectares were included in the land
concession or the terms of the PDA: “it is patently clear as a matter of law that when

parties do not agree on material terms during the negotiations, they do not have an

agreement. The parties never concluded those negotiations and never signed the

agreements.”!>!

At the closing of the Hearing, the Respondent explained that the 16-hectare issue was
irrelevant because the key land was next to the bridge on the side of the river rather than
on the road frontage land as there would be a need to isolate the gambling area,

including space for customs control.

As regards the slot license, the Respondent has alleged that it was obtained through
bribes paid by Mr. Bouker to Mr. Boumong at the MIC.

7.4.4. The Tribunal’s Analysis

It was decided in the Tribunal’s ruling on the Merits of the Claimant’s Second Material
Breach Application that, in the Tribunal’s view,

the Claimant has not established a land entitlement that includes the disputed

16 hectares, and there is no undertaking by the Government in Section 22 to

use its powers of eminent domain to expropriate the existing private owners

for the financial benefit of the Claimant. Refusal to expropriate private land

for the private gain of the Claimant does not constitute evidence of ‘bad

faith.’!*
This decision was reached by the Tribunal in the context of whether the Government
breached Article 22 of the Deed of Settlement by failing to negotiate the Thakhet related
agreements in good faith. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants have also failed
to establish rights to the remainder of the land referred to in the MOU. Sanum had 365
days from the date of the Land Concession Agreement to seek all the approvals for all
investment activities described in the MOU. In turn, before the Land Concession
Agreement could be signed, Sanum needed to complete a Feasibility Study, a Master
Plan and a Socio-Economic and Environmental Impact Study for the Land Concession,
all to be approved by the Concessioner. The Land Concession Agreement required by
the MOU was never signed; it never went beyond the negotiation stage. Despite face

to face negotiations over the PDA throughout the summer and fall of 2011, Sanum and

-83-

the SEZ Committee had not finalized the terms of the PDA, including the land
concession.'* In the overall picture, whether or not Sanum had obtained a licence had

no impact on the viability of its Thakhaek project.

245. In the view of the Tribunal it is clear from the MOU that Savan Vegas could not expand
to Thakhaek in the Kammouane Province without the “final approval from all
governmental authorities (central and local).”!*4 The MOU provides for the
eventuality that the approval is forthcoming and also in case it is not.!*> Furthermore,
the MOU subjects the exact location of the Concession Land to a future agreement:
“Once the exact location of the Concession Land has been agreed upon, the
Concessionee will confirm its acceptance of the Concession Land in writing to the

Concessioner.”!*° There was never any agreement in this respect.

246. The MOU shows that Savan Vegas’ monopoly rights did not encompass a right to

establish slot clubs or casinos beyond the area covered by the Savan Vegas PDA:

If the Concessionee would like to expand the casino or slot business of Savan
Vegas, which is an investment project of Sanum Investments Limited
according to the Foreign Investment License no. 09507 [not readable], dated
17 August 2007 to the Concession Land to be a branch (Welcome Center) of
Savan Vegas such expansion shall be proposed, approved and agreed in
writing from the Government first before implementing such expansion. The
Khammouane Province wilfully [sic] support the expansion of Savan Vegas
to the Land Concession according to the appropriate procedures and
regulations. '*?

247. As regards to the slot license, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent’s witnesses from
the MIC and the Government Secretariat Office have claimed that the license was
issued by mistake.!>* The Respondent has argued that the MIC had no authority to issue
the license because of Notice No. 1957 of the Prime Minister and says that the license
was procured by a bribe. Leaving aside the issue of the bribes allegedly paid by the

Claimants, the Tribunal observes that the license was effective for less than ten days

and that the revocation was justified on the lack of authority of the MIC to grant it. The
Tribunal appreciates that Notice No. 1957 refers to the Government and is not explicitly
limited to the Prime Minister’s office but by 2011 Sanum was fully aware that the Prime
Minister’s Office was the essential authority on the Claimants’ gambling ventures in
Laos. The Prime Minister’s Office never approved the Claimants’ gambling project in
Thakhaek. The Claimants had just finished a bruising encounter with the Government
over the Claimants’ failure to fulfill its obligations in respect of the Paksong Hotel and
Casino project. By 2011, the Claimants had entirely failed to live up to their Paksong
commitments, while pretending otherwise. The Claimants had demonstrated

themselves not to be good faith investors.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants were seeking in bad faith (even if not by bribes)
to manipulate Government officials to obtain approvals to which the Claimants were
not entitled. It is significant that the MIC licence was issued to Sanum in February
2011 by the same Minister that was ordered to cancel the Paksan license for lack of

authority one year earlier in February 2010.

Negotiations for the renewal of the Flat Tax Agreement had stalled by March 2011.
The Government was agitating for accountability in respect of its 20% interest in Savan
Vegas. The Claimant alleges that the 16-hectare parcel on Highway 13 was essential
to the success of the Thakhaek project, yet negotiations for the 16-hectare parcel never
reached agreement in the Tribunal’s view. Thus Sanum acquired no rights in Thakhaek
property. There was no Land Concession Agreement for a site on which gambling
facilities could be built. The other approvals that would have been required contingent
on the signing of the Land Concession Agreement (which never happened) became
moot. The Thakhaek project was not expropriated. The licence was revoked for good
and sufficient cause. The project itself never came into legal existence. The MOU
provided that the Claimant’s Thakhaek project could not proceed without “the final
approval of, by or from all Government authorities (central and local)” which was never
obtained. The Tribunal appreciates the chagrin of the Claimant at paying US $400,000
which, in the end, did not result in a viable project but the failure cannot be attributed

to any actionable fault on the part of the Government.

The Tribunal concludes that there is insufficient evidence of bad faith on either side in
respect of Thakhek. It was simply a commercial possibility that never reached the stage

of agreement.

COSTS

The Respondent Government claims costs for the period from 23 February 2017
through 22 February 2019 in respect of lawyers’ fees in the amount of
US$ 1,161,611.48 and expenses of US$ 151,640.83, being in total US$1,313,252.31.
These fees are exclusive of and apart from the costs sought by the Government arising
out of Lao Holdings N.V. v. The Government of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic,
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/12/6, which was not consolidated with this case, but for the
most part heard jointly with it. (The Respondent Government claims a total of
$2,780,736.03 in respect of both the ICSID and PCA proceedings). By way of
comparison, the Claimants indicated that if successful (and even if not wholly
successful) they would be seeking $20,929,951.36 in total in respect of both the ICSID
and PCA proceedings. The Claimant’s claim, unlike the Respondent’s claim, does

include the expenses and charges of the respective Secretariats.
Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:

1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and,
if it deems appropriate, in another decision.
2. The term “costs” includes only:

(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each
arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;

(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;

(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required
by the arbitral tribunal;

(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent
such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;

(ce) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the
arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the
amount of such costs is reasonable;

(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees
and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.

253. Article 42 of the 2010 UNCITRAL Rules provides:

(1) The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful
party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such
costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable,
taking into account the circumstances of the case.

(2) The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in
any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to
another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.

254. According to Article 42, the costs of the arbitration “shall in principle be borne by the
unsuccessful party or parties” but grants the Tribunal discretionary power to apportion
costs, based on what is reasonable in the circumstances of the case. While there is some
variation in tribunals’ practices, the prevailing approach of international investment
tribunals is to order costs to follow the event. The Claimants themselves have endorsed
this principle in putting forward their own claim for the “costs and expenses of this

proceeding, including attorneys’ fees”.*

255. According to the Claimants, the quantum of their original claims if wholly successful,

might have reached US $1 billion.

256. The costs claim advanced by Sanum and LHNV include US $10,109,872.71 for legal
work prior to the Settlement of 15 June 2014. The Respondent’s claim commences
post-settlement, specifically from 23 February 2017 — ice., after the date Claimant
Sanum filed its Second Material Breach Application before the PCA Tribunal. From
and after 23 February 2017, the two cases (PCA Case No. 2013-13 and ICSID Case No.
ARB(AF)/12/6) proceeded in parallel although, as mentioned, not consolidated.> Thus,
after 23 February 2017, work on all written submissions, evidentiary applications,
interim conferences and hearings as well as the Hearing were combined, then evenly
divided as between the PCA proceedings and the ICSID proceedings. In the result, the
Respondent seeks an order that the Claimant Sanum pay 50% of its legal costs,
including lawyers’ fees and expenses, incurred from 23 February 2017 through the

present.

257. The Claimant points out that it was successful on a number of the interlocutory matters
including a defeat of the Government’s jurisdictional challenges and establishment in

the Second Material Breach Application, that the Government had failed in two

important aspects to honour the Settlement, namely, the establishment of a new FTA to
assist in the sale of Savan Vegas, and the Government’s failure to halt existing and
potential criminal proceedings. These were important successes for the Claimants, but
in the end, they failed to establish after years of litigation any liability on the part of the
Government in respect of any of their myriad of claims of Treaty violations (as

distinguished from two breaches of the 2014 Settlement Agreement, as mentioned).

In the circumstances the Tribunal thinks it appropriate, in its discretion, to award the

Respondent Government its costs.

8.1. Expenses
8.1.1. Travel Expenses

The Respondent’s travel expenses represent travel to Singapore twice by various
witnesses and the Respondent’s lawyers and staff, for matters involving the Tribunal.
These travel expenses also include travel to Laos, Paris, and Hong Kong for matters

such as fact development, evidence gathering and document review.!°°

8.1.2. Miscellaneous Services and Expenses

The remainder of the Respondent’s expenses relate to services and expenses required
to pursue the arbitrations, some of which were incurred in-house and others by external
vendors. Such services include translation services; court reporter and transcript fees;
express delivery expenses; research; and trial preparation services in Singapore, such

as copying, binding presentations, and creating witness and evidentiary notebooks.

The Respondent’s total expenses (other than legal fees) requested in this arbitration
amount to US $151,640.83.'% This sum, taken together with legal fees of
US $1,161,611.48, produces a total cost award of US $1,313,252.31.
