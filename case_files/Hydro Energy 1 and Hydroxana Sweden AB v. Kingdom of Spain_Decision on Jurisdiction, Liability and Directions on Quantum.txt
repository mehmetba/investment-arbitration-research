INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty,
which entered into force on 16 April 1998 with respect to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,
the Kingdom of Sweden and the Kingdom of Spain (the “ECT”), and the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which

entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The claimants are Hydro Energy 1 S.a r.l. (“Hydro Energy”), a private limited company
(société a@ responsabilité limitée) incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and
Hydroxana Sweden AB (“Hydroxana”), a private limited liability company (Aktiebolag)

incorporated under the laws of Sweden (together, the ““Claimants”).
The respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or the “Respondent’).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties”.

The Parties’ representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to measures implemented by the Respondent that modified the
regulatory and economic regime applicable to producers of hydropower generation energy,
which allegedly negatively impacted the Claimants’ investment (equity and debt interests)
in various Spanish companies that own and operate thirty-three hydropower generation

plants in Spain with a total installed production capacity of 106.788 megawatts (“MW”).

The Claimants allege that Spain has breached its obligations under Article 13 of the ECT
by means of the indirect expropriation of their investment. They also submit that the
Respondent has failed to comply with the following obligations under Article 10(1) of the
ECT: (a) to accord fair and equitable treatment (“FET”), (b) not to impair by unreasonable
or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of
the Claimants’ investment, and (c) to accord the most constant protection and security
(“MCPS”). The Claimants seek compensation for damage caused as a result of the
Respondent’s violations of the ECT amounting to EUR 132.1 million.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 13 October 2015, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 5 October 2015
from the Claimants against Spain, accompanied by exhibits C-0001 to C-0016
(the “Request for Arbitration”).

On 19 October 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration
in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of
the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to
proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with
Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and

Arbitration Proceedings.

In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed to
constitute the Tribunal as follows: three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party, and
the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties. Pursuant to the
Parties’ agreed method of constitution, failing an agreement of the Parties on the presiding
arbitrator, she or he would be appointed by the Secretary-General of ICSID following a
blind ‘strike-and-rank’ procedure, without limitation to the ICSID Panel of Arbitrators.
Under this procedure, each Party struck candidates from a list of names and ranked the
remaining ones by order of preference. The nominated candidate was the one, out of those

not struck-out by either Party, who obtained the lowest score adding both parties’ points.

The Tribunal is composed of Lord Collins of Mapesbury, a national of the United
Kingdom, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr Peter Rees, a national of
the United Kingdom, appointed by the Claimants; and Professor Rolf Knieper, a national

of Germany, appointed by the Respondent.

On 3 May 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the Parties
that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore

deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr Gonzalo Flores, ICSID Team

Leader/Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal, assisted by

Ms Ana Constanza Conover Blancas, ICSID Legal Counsel.

On 22 June 2016, Ms Conover was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal,

replacing Mr Flores.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on 27 June 2016, by telephone conference.

Following the first session, on 12 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of
the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provided, inter alia, that the
applicable Arbitration Rules were those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural
languages were English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding was Washington,

DC. Procedural Order No. | also set out the procedural calendar for this arbitration.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 4 November 2016, the Claimants filed a
Memorial on the Merits (the “Claimants’ Memorial’); accompanied by exhibits C-0017
to C-0128; legal authorities CL-0001 to CL-0091; two witness statements, by Mr Luis
Quiroga and Mr Jaume Margarit; and two expert reports, one by Mr Carlos Solé of KPMG
Asesores S.L. (“KPMG”) and the other by Professor Pablo Spiller and Mr Santiago

Dellepiane Avellaneda of Compass Lexecon.

On 24 February 2017, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and a
Memorial on Jurisdiction (the “Respondent’s Counter-Memorial’); accompanied by
exhibits R-0001 to R-0238; legal authorities RL-0001 to RL-0067; a witness statement of
Ms Carmen Lépez (or “Ms Lépez’); and an expert report of Dr Daniel Flores of Econ One

Research, Inc.

On 30 March 2017, with the purpose of reducing the volume of hard copies in the
proceeding, the Parties proposed amendments to Procedural Order No. | for the Tribunal’s
consideration. On 3 April 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, concerning

the submission of hard copies in the proceeding.

On 4 May 2017, following exchanges between the Parties, the Parties filed a request for
the Tribunal to decide on production of documents in a Redfern Schedule
format. On 16 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, concerning the
production of documents. Regarding documents 1 to 7 of the Respondent’s document
production requests, the determination of these requests was adjourned, and the Tribunal
directed the Claimants to file a statement from a responsible officer stating whether such

documents existed.

On 19 June 2017, pursuant to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 3, the Claimants

submitted a Second Witness Statement of Mr Luis Quiroga dated 16 June 2017.

On 7 July 2017, in view of the evidence adduced by Mr Quiroga in his Second Witness
Statement, the Tribunal made no order on items 1 to 7 of the Respondent’s document

production requests of 4 May 2017.

On 24 August 2017, the Tribunal proposed amendments to Procedural Order No. 1
concerning the filing of hard copies of pleadings and supporting documents and invited
the Parties to submit any comments concerning the proposal by 31 August 2017. On
5 September 2017, having received the Parties’ observations on the proposed modifications
to Procedural Order No. 1, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, concerning the

number of copies and method of filing of the Parties’ presentations.

On 9 October 2017, the Claimants filed a Reply on the Merits and a Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction (the “Claimants’ Reply”); accompanied by exhibits C-0129 to C-0185 and a
consolidated index of Claimants’ factual exhibits; legal authorities CL-0092 to CL-0134
and a consolidated index of the Claimants’ legal authorities; a Third Witness Statement of
Mr Luis Quiroga; a Second Expert Report of Mr Carlos Solé of KPMG, and a Second
Expert Report of Professor Pablo Spiller and Mr Santiago Dellepiane Avellaneda of

Compass Lexecon.

On 19 February 2018, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on
Jurisdiction (the “Respondents’ Rejoinder’); accompanied by exhibits R-0239 to R-0378

and a consolidated list of the Respondent’s factual exhibits; legal authorities RL-0068 to

One Research, Inc.

On 28 February 2018, the Parties notified the Tribunal of the witnesses and experts to be

cross-examined at the oral hearing.

On 9 March 2018, following a pre-hearing organizational meeting held between the
Tribunal and the Parties by telephone conference on 6 March 2018, the Tribunal issued

Procedural Order No. 5 on procedural matters pertaining to the organization of the hearing.

On 12 March 2018, the Claimants filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdictional Objections
(the “Claimants’ Rejoinder’), accompanied by exhibit C-0186 with a consolidated list of
factual exhibits; and legal authorities CL-0135 to CL-0145 with a consolidated list of

legal authorities.

On 15 March 2018, the Respondent requested to submit corrected versions of its Rejoinder
on the Merits, a corrected consolidated list of legal authorities, and revised translations of
certain documents. Absent any objections from the Claimants, the Tribunal authorized the

Respondent to file such documents into the record of the case.

On 16 March 2018, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the
admissibility of new documents. On 23 March 2018, the Claimants filed observations on

the Respondent’s request of 16 March 2018.

On 23 March 2018, the Claimants informed the Tribunal and the Respondent of the
inability of one of their fact witnesses, Mr Jaume Margarit, to attend the hearing. The
Claimants requested that Mr Margarit be excused from participation in the hearing under

Procedural Order No.1 and Article 4.7 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence.

On 23 March 2018, following instructions from the Tribunal, the Parties submitted a
joint expert memorandum on regulatory issues prepared by the Claimants’ expert,
Mr Carlos Solé of KPMG and the Respondent’s expert, Dr Daniel Flores of Econ One

Research, Inc.

On 26 March 2018, the Tribunal decided on the Respondent’s request of 16 March 2018

to incorporate new documents into the record of the case.

By communications of 27 and 28 March 2018, the Parties exchanged views on the
consequences that Mr Margarit’s absence at the hearing should have with respect to his

written evidence.

On 28 March 2018, following authorization from the Tribunal, the Respondent submitted
legal authorities RL-0105 to RL-0109.

On 28 March 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision not to remove the
witness statement of Mr Jaume Margarit from the record in view of all the circumstances
and indicated that the Tribunal would give it such weight as it considered appropriate,

inter alia, in the light of all the evidence and submissions.

On 28 March 2018, following instructions from the Tribunal, the Parties submitted a joint
expert memorandum on quantum issues prepared by the Claimants’ experts, Messrs. Spiller

on 5 April 2018 that it would not rely on references to Mr Margarit’s evidence in the

On 31 May 2018, the Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs; the Claimants’ post
hearing brief was accompanied by legal authority CL-0146 with a consolidated list of

legal authorities.

On 25 June 2018, the Claimants filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the
admissibility of a new document, together with a written submission commenting on the
relevance of such document. On 26 June 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that,
unless the Respondent objected, the Claimants would be authorized to submit the requested
document together with a written submission by 12 July 2018, and the Respondent would
be authorized to respond to the Claimants’ submission within 14 days of its receipt. Absent
objections from the Respondent, on 12 July 2018, the Claimants submitted the document
as legal authority CL-0147 together with a written submission. On 1 August 2018, the
Tribunal took note that no response had been submitted by the Respondent to the

Claimants’ submission of 12 July 2018.

On 5 September 2018, the Claimants filed a request for the Tribunal to decide
on the admissibility of a new document, together with a written submission commenting
on the relevance of such document. On 6 September 2018, the Tribunal informed the
Parties that, unless the Respondent objected within seven days, the Claimants would be
authorized to submit the requested document, and the Parties would be invited to agree on

a timetable for the submission of observations regarding the relevance of such document.

On 11 September 2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to
the introduction of the requested document into the record and filed a request for the
Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of a new document. On 13 September 2018, the
Tribunal informed the Parties that, unless the Claimants objected within seven days, the
Respondent’s request would be granted. On 17 September 2018, the Claimants notified
the Tribunal that they had no objection to the introduction of the document requested by
the Respondent subject to an opportunity to file a written submission commenting on the

relevance of such document.

On 17 September 2018, the Tribunal authorized the Parties to introduce into the record
the documents requested on 5 and 11 September 2018, together with a written submission
commenting on their relevance. On 5 October 2018, the Parties filed their respective
submissions. The Claimants’ written submission was accompanied by legal authority
CL-0148 and the Respondent’s submission was accompanied by legal authority RL-0110

with a consolidated list of legal authorities.

On 16 October 2018, the European Commission filed an “Application for Leave to
Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party” pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), with
accompanying documentation. ICSID transmitted a copy of the application to the Tribunal
on the same date. On 17 October 2018, ICSID transmitted a copy of the application to the
Parties and the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide observations on the application. On

7 November 2018, the Parties submitted their respective observations on the application.

By letter of 19 November 2018, the Tribunal decided on the European Commission’s
application of 16 October 2018. The Tribunal considered that the requirements of ICSID
Arbitration Rule 37(2) were satisfied in this case, and that it would be assisted by receiving
a written submission from the European Commission. The Tribunal allowed the European
Commission to intervene only in writing, without access to the record of the case and
subject to conditions, including that the submission be no longer than twenty pages, and
that the European Commission should not append copies of documents or authorities to its
submission. The Tribunal did not consider it necessary to require the European
Commission to provide an undertaking on costs as a condition for its intervention and

therefore rejected the Claimants’ request in this regard.

On 3 December 2018, the European Commission filed a written submission under
ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) which exceeded the twenty-page limit imposed by the
Tribunal. Following instructions from the Tribunal, on 4 December 2018, the Secretary of
the Tribunal transmitted a copy of the European Commission’s written submission to the
Parties and the Tribunal, and informed the Parties that, rather than requiring the European
Commission to re-submit its intervention submission, the Tribunal directed that the Parties’

observations could be up to a similar length.

On 18 December 2018, each Party filed observations on the European Commission’s
submission pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) (“Comments on EC Submission”).

The Claimants’ observations were accompanied by legal authority CL-0149.

On 28 January 2019, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the
admissibility of a new document, together with a written submission commenting on the
relevance of such document. On 4 February 2019, the Claimants filed observations on the
Respondent’s request. On 5 February 2019, the Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request
of 28 January 2019.

On 12 February 2019, following authorization from the Tribunal, the Respondent
submitted new legal authorities RL-0111, RL-0112 and RL-0113 with a consolidated list
of legal authorities and its observations on those documents. On 19 February 2019, the
Claimants submitted their observations on the three new documents and on the

Respondent’s written submission of 12 February 2019.

On 14 March 2019, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide
on the admissibility of a new document, together with a written submission commenting
on the relevance of such document. On 16 March 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties
that, subject to any objection from the Claimants by 22 March 2019, the Respondent’s

request would be granted.

On 18 March 2019, the Claimants submitted objections to the Respondent’s request of
14 March 2019. On 19 March 2019, having considered the Parties’ observations, the
Tribunal granted the Respondent’s request of 14 March 2019.

On 1 and 2 April 2019, the Respondent filed the new document into the record as legal
authorities RL-0114 and RL-0115, together with a consolidated list of legal authorities and
its observations on the relevance of such document. On 12 April 2019, the Claimants filed

a reply to the Respondent’s observations of 1 April 2019.

On 17 and 18 April 2019, the Respondent and the Claimants, respectively, submitted their
statements of costs. The Claimants’ submission was accompanied by two documents
labelled as CL-0150 and CL-0151. On 20 April 2019, the Tribunal received the
Respondent’s statement of costs, admitted the Claimants’ statement of costs and its two
accompanying documents into the record, and allowed the Respondent to reply to the
Claimants’ statement of costs. On 10 May 2019, the Respondent submitted its comments

on the Claimants’ submission on costs of 18 April 2019.

On 4 December 2019, the Respondent filed a request for the Tribunal to decide
on the admissibility of two new documents. On 6 December 2019, the Claimants
submitted objections to the Respondent’s request of 4 December 2019. On 9 December
2019, having considered the Parties’ observations, the Tribunal authorized the Respondent

to introduce the two new legal authorities into the record of the case.

On 20 December 2019, the Respondent proposed the disqualification of Mr. Peter Rees, in
accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9
(the “Disqualification Proposal”). On the same date, the Centre informed the Parties that
the proceeding had been suspended until the other Members of the Tribunal, Lord Collins
and Professor Knieper (the “Unchallenged Arbitrators”) ruled on the proposal, in

accordance with Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.

On 13 January 2020, the Respondent filed a Supplementation on the Disqualification
Proposal of Mr. Peter Rees. On 14 January 2020, the Claimants filed observations in
response to the Respondent’s Disqualification Proposal. On 20 January 2020, Mr Rees
furnished his explanations on the Disqualification Proposal as envisaged by
ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). Both Parties were allowed to submit additional observations
on the Disqualification Proposal by 27 January 2020. No additional observations were

received from either Party by that date.

On 17 February 2020, the Claimants requested leave to introduce a new document into the

record. The request was rejected by the Unchallenged Arbitrators on the same date.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. The Claimants

The Claimants are part of the HgCapital LLP group (“HgCapital”), a private

equity enterprise.
The Claimants’ small-hydro investments consist of two portfolios:
(1) The Xana Portfolio, consisting of 14 plants with a total installed capacity of
approximately 53.675 MW, which the Claimants acquired in May 2011; and

(2) The Ondina Portfolio, consisting of 19 plants with a total installed capacity of

approximately 53.113 MW, which the Claimants acquired in December 2011.

In 2009 and 2010 HgCapital had invested in photovoltaic (“PV”) plants in Spain.”

(1) Xana Portfolio

The Claimants paid EUR 26.3 million for a 100% equity interest in Hidro Xana S.L.U.
(“Hidro Xana”). As part of this transaction, a shareholder loan from Naturener Hidro
S.L.U. (the company that subsequent to its acquisition by Rinlantium changed its name to
Hidro Xana S.L.U) to Grupo Naturener S.A. (i.e. the sellers of Hidro Xana) in the amount
of EUR 23.9 million was re-assigned from Grupo Naturener S.A. to Rinlantium S.L.

(a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hydroxana).
The bank debt held by Hidrodata S.A. (“Hidrodata”) was refinanced in September 2015.

The bank debt held by Hidro Xana was refinanced in March 2017.

The Xana Portfolio comprises 14 hydropower plants located in Galicia, Extremadura,
Castilla y Leon and Castilla La Mancha. Thirteen of the plants have an installed capacity

of less than 10 MW, while the remaining one has an installed capacity of 17.474 MW.

(2) Ondina Portfolio

The Claimants paid EUR 46.0 million for a 100% equity interest in Hidrodata. As part
of the Claimants’ acquisition of Hidrodata, Hydroxana made a debt investment in
Hidrodata of EUR 7.8 million in the form of a mezzanine loan in January 2012. The
mezzanine loan was transferred from Hydroxana to Hydro Energy, i.e. within the

Claimants, on 30 December 2012.

The Ondina Portfolio consists of 19 hydropower plants located in Catalonia (where the
majority are located) and Aragon. Eighteen of the plants have an installed capacity of less

than 10 MW, while the remaining one has an installed capacity of 13.5 MW.

B. The Position when the Claimants Acquired the Plants in 2011

This section will consider the Spanish regulatory framework against the background of
European Union (“EU”) policy. Spanish legislation for this purpose consists of Laws
(or Acts) approved by the legislature; Royal-Decree Laws (“RD-L”) which are enacted by
the executive, but subject to legislative approval; and Royal Decrees (“RD”), which

implement RD-Ls.

It is important to emphasise at this stage that an RD-L is enacted by the executive, and is
subject to the Law or Act under which it is promulgated. This is accepted by the Claimants

as a matter of Spanish law.?

In the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change industrialised
States (including Spain) committed to a reduction in greenhouse gases and to allocate

resources to deal with climate change.

723. Energy Act 40/1994* and RD 2366/1994:° Act 82/1980, on Energy Conservation,®
promoted the adoption of renewable energies, among them hydroelectric power,
establishing a legal framework for the construction, expansion, or adaptation of small
hydroelectric power plants. RD 1217/1981’ dealt with the promotion of hydroelectric
production in small power plants. Facilities commissioned after 1981 were to be

remunerated on the basis of a regulated payment per unit of energy produced. *

74. Under the Energy Act 40/1994 and RD 2366/1994 small-hydro facilities were
automatically incorporated into the economic regime of RD 2366/1994,° with the aim of
establishing an economic regime that contemplated the “necessary balance between
adequate profitability of the project and a cost for the electrical system that would not
involve increased tariffs.”!° The Ordinary Regime was applicable to conventional
generation facilities (i.e. non-renewable sources such as coal-fired plants), and it required
producers to sell their electricity output in the wholesale electricity market at the pool price
(i.e. the market price). Qualifying renewable energy producers, whose installed capacity
was below a certain threshold, became subject to the “Special Regime” and its more
favourable feed-in remuneration regime. Small-hydro facilities under the RD 1217/1981
regime were automatically incorporated into the economic regime of RD 2366/1994, which
required renewable producers to register their installations in a new Registro
Administrativo de Instalaciones de Produccién en Régimen Especial (“RAIPRE”), after

establishing that the facility complied with certain administrative requirements.

Electricity Act 54/1997:!! The Electricity Act 54/1997 liberalised the Spanish electricity
sector and set out the general principles and objectives for its implementation. It provided
that by 2010 the contribution of renewable sources of energy to Spain’s gross energy
consumption should reach 12%. Qualifying electricity generators using renewable sources
of energy as primary energy, and with an installed capacity of less than 50 MW, became
subject to a “Special Regime” (Article 27). The Special Regime generators were entitled
to receive the market price of electricity plus a supplementary premium (the amount of
which was to be fixed in statutory terms by governmental regulations). Ordinary Regime
traditional generation plants received remuneration from the wholesale price of electricity.

The overall object was to secure the supply of energy at low cost for consumers.

Electricity Act 54/1997 gave small-hydro plants commissioned before RD 1217/1981 the
possibility of joining the incentive scheme for the rest of their operational life, so that small-
hydro facilities with more than 20 years of operation (previously excluded from the
Special Regime established in 1994) were entitled to the same feed-in remuneration as new

facilities.
Article 30(4) of the Electricity Act 54/1997 provided:

The determination of premiums will take account of the voltage
level of the delivery of energy to the network, the effective
contribution to the improvement of the environment, the primary
energy savings and energy efficiency, the production of
economically justifiable useful heat and the investment costs
incurred, in order to achieve reasonable profitability rates with
reference to the cost of the money on the capital markets. !?

All energy producers were required to be registered in the RAIPRE.

The Electricity Act 54/1997 was implemented by a series of Royal Decrees, following

Spain’s signature in April 1998 of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework

Convention on Climate Change, which required the contracting parties to reduce

greenhouse gas emissions and set binding emission targets to achieve reduction.

RD 2818/1998:'* RD 2818/1998 implemented the Special Regime, and provided that
Special Regime generators who had been duly registered in the RAIPRE were entitled to
remuneration consisting of the market price plus a premium. RD 2818/1998 classified the
qualifying Special Regime renewable generators into categories and groups according to,
inter alia, the generation technologies used. It classified small-hydro generation
installations into (1) group b.4, comprising hydropower installations whose installed
capacity was not higher than 10 MW; and (2) group b.5, comprising hydropower
installations whose installed capacity was higher than 10 MW but less than 50 MW.
Group b.4 installations were entitled to a premium of 5.45 pesetas/kWh (a FiP) or in the
event the facilities chose not to apply the premium, to a regulated tariff of
11.20 pesetas/kWh (a FiT). The premium for group b.5 installations was calculated by
applying a specific formula to the premium payable to group b.4 based on the relevant

facility’s installed capacity.

Installations which had been registered in the RAIPRE before the entry into force of the
Electricity Act 54/1997 could choose between remuneration based on: (a) RD 2818/1998;
or (b) RD 2366/1994, until 1 June 2007.

The premiums set out in RD 2818/1998 were subject to revision every four years, based on
the evolution of the price of electricity on the market, the participation of Special Regime
facilities in coverage of demand, and their impact on the technical management of the
electricity system (Article 32). According to the Claimants,!> this involved a lack of
predictability and stability regarding the applicable premiums and made investment under
the RD 2818/1998 regime less attractive for private investors, and Spain realised that it

needed to revise its legal and economic framework to provide more stable, sufficient, and

predictable economic incentives to attract private capital into renewable projects, including

increasing the role of project finance debt.

The Development Plan for Renewable Energies 2000-2010 (1999 PER”):'° The
1999 PER was prepared by the Instituto para la Diversificacién y Ahorro de la Energia
(“IDAE”) and approved by the Council of Ministers in December 1999. It set the targets
for implementation of renewable energies for a baseline scenario of an annual increase in
electricity demand at 2%. The plan recognised that small-hydro was among the

technologies which had reached “very high levels of maturity.” !7

The 1999 PER determined standard facilities, different benchmarks were established for
each (cost of investment, operating cost, useful life of the plant, production hours subject
to a premium, market price), which would allow each plant, within a certain period of time
(useful life), to reach a reasonable rate of return according to the cost of money on the
capital markets. The return of the standard projects was estimated at “7% with own

resources, before financing and after tax.”!8

87. RD 436/2004:*4 RD 436/2004 was enacted to implement the 1999 PER and replace
RD 2818/1998. The Economic Report on RD 436/2004 prepared by the Ministry of
Energy stated:

Parameter A [Production cost: the investment, operating and
maintenance costs for each technology] has a significant weighting
in establishing the amount of the regulated tariff for sale to
distributors. This way, any plant in Spain in the special regime,
provided it is equal to or better than the standard (the standardised
plant) for its group, will obtain reasonable return.

 

. it is assumed, in all cases, that 100% of the funding will come
from equity. The leverage and percentage between equity and other
sources of funding are independent decisions in each project and for
each promoter that, when made wisely, should provide better ratios
than those estimated in this report.?°

The goal is to continue down the path begun by Royal Decree
2818/1998 ... with the added benefit of being able to simultaneously
take advantage of the stability brought to the system as a whole by
Royal Decree 1432/2002 ... to provide those who have decided or
decide in the near future to make a commitment to the special regime
of a long-lasting, objective and transparent regulatory framework.

Whatever remuneration mechanism is chosen, the Royal Decree

guarantees the owners of the facilities under the special regime a

reasonable remuneration for their investments and it guarantees

electricity consumers a_ reasonable allocation of the costs

attributable to the electric system ...77
RD 436/2004 gave qualifying renewable energy producers the right to choose, on an annual
basis, between: (a) a fixed tariff, calculated as a specific percentage of the TMR, defined
as a single flat rate and, where applicable, a supplement for reactive energy (“regulated
tariff option”); and (b) the pool price plus a premium and an incentive for participating in
the market, and, where applicable, a supplement for reactive energy (“pool price plus
premium option”). Premium, incentive and supplement were all calculated by reference to

the TMR as a fixed percentage.

RD 436/2004”* maintained RD 2818/1998’s classification of hydropower installations into
category “b”, and further into group “b.4” (hydropower installations whose installed
capacity was no more than 10 MW) and group “b.5” (hydropower installations whose
installed capacity was higher than 10 MW but less than 50 MW) in Article 2. It also
provided for tariffs, premiums and incentives, calculated as percentages of the TMR, for

the operational lifespan of such installations (Article 36).

Pursuant to the transitional provisions of RD 436/2004, existing Special Regime
installations which were previously under RD 2818/1998 could choose: (a) to benefit from
the economic regime established in RD 436/2004 from the date RD 436/2004 entered into

automatically from 1 January 2007 (later extended to 31 May 2007).

92. Article 40(1) of RD 436/2004 contemplated revisions to the regulated tariff, premiums and
incentives stipulated therein, every four years starting from 2006, based on the costs
associated with each of the renewable technologies, their degree of participation in the
Special Regime in demand coverage and their impact on the technical and economic

management of the system.
93. Article 40 provided:

Article 40. Revision of tariffs, premiums, incentives and
supplements for new installations.

In 2006, in view of the findings of the monitoring reports on the
degree of compliance with the Renewable Energies Promotion Plan,
the tariffs, premiums, incentives and supplements defined in this
Royal Decree will undergo revision, taking into account the costs
associated with each one of these technologies, their degree of
participation in the special regime in demand coverage and their
impact on the technical and economic management of the system.
Every four years, beginning in 2006, a new revision shall
take place.*°

any of the revisions provided for in this section shall apply solely to
the facilities that commence operations subsequent to the date of the

into force of RD 661/2007). The Claimants’ small-hydro installations in the Xana Portfolio chose option (a)
(ie. benefit from RD 436/2004 and its “pool price plus incentive and premium” option from 28 March 2004), while

RD 436/2004 was an improvement to the incentive scheme under RD 2818/1998, but Spain
became dissatisfied with RD 436/2004’s progress in attracting investment to the Spanish
renewable industry. Since the feed-in scheme under RD 436/2004 was based on the TMR,
which changed on a yearly basis, there were inevitably fluctuations in the tariffs, premiums
and incentives that investors would receive. The Claimants submit that “[t]hese
fluctuations meant a lack of predictability, as it was difficult for investors to foresee what
actual income might be consistently received over the long term. This lack of predictability
and stability made investment under [RD 436/2004] more risky and ... less attractive to

lenders than it might otherwise have been”.**

2005-2010 Renewable Energy Promotion Plan (“2005-2010 PER”):*? The 2005-2010
PER was prepared by IDAE and approved by the Council of Ministers in August 2005.
The aim of the 2005-2010 PER was to provide recommendations which would assist in
further increasing investment in renewable energy in Spain as RD 436/2004 had not

resulted in the expected increase in installed renewable capacity. *

Spain concluded that it would need to attract investments amounting to approximately
EUR 24 billion into the Spanish renewable energy sector to achieve its policy targets. The
Plan recognised the fundamental importance of ensuring that renewable projects be both
attractive to investors and palatable to lending institutions (i.e. capable of supporting
project finance): “*... it is essential to place the various technologies in a position to be of
financial performance, thereby making them attractive to investors, as well as to facilitate

access to bank financing.”*>

In relation to hydropower generation, the 2005-2010 PER Summary stated that
“Th]ydroelectricity is one of Spain’s main sources of electricity” and that, “[g]iven the level
of resources available, it has a long history in Spain, and as a result the sector is mature
and consolidated” and noted that small-scale (i.e. less than 10 MW) hydropower generation
was “advancing more slowly than envisaged”, and recommended the further development
of the hydropower sector. It recommended installation of additional generation capacity
of: (a) 450 MW of small-scale (i.e. less than 10 MW) hydropower capacity, to reach a total
of 2,199 MW of installed capacity by 2010; and (b) 360 MW of other hydropower capacity
(between 10 to 50 MW), to reach a total of 3,257 MW of installed capacity by 2010.*°

The 2005-2010 PER Summary also said:

In order to bring the targets set out here to fruition, a detailed
evaluation has been made of the investment envisaged over the
period as a whole, the nature of this investment and the public aid
necessary to meet the targets. This analysis, based on the specific
features of each technology, such as its degree of maturity and
contribution to the overall target, rests on a balance between all the
factors, such that a return is achieved from on public and private
investments, and the necessary resources are mobilised to ensure the
envisaged investments are made.*”

The 2005-2010 PER established the following conception of return of standard projects:
“Return on Project Type: calculated on the basis of maintaining an Internal Rate of Return
(IRR), measured in legal tender and for each standard project, around 7%, on equity (before

any financing) and after taxes.”?*

RD-L 7/2006:*° RD-L 7/2006 adopted urgent measures for the energy sector. It suspended

reason for RD-L 7/2006 was that the majority of the facilities opted for remuneration
according to the market price plus the premium, thereby earning much higher remuneration
than had been forecast by the regulator. According to the Claimants this only had the
intention of temporarily freezing the feed-in remuneration paid to renewable energy

facilities under RD 436/2004 until Spain could de-couple them from the TMR.*!

101. In February 2007 the Spanish Comisién Nacional de Energia (“CNE’”) reported that a
majority of its Board considered that the need to make what became RD 661/2007

retroactive had not been sufficiently justified, and emphasised that RD 436/2004 had “a

very significant quality, which is regulatory stability.”

102. RD 661/2007:* The objective of RD 661/2007 was to create enhanced incentives. It stated

in its preamble:

The creation of the special regime electricity generation was an
important milestone in our country’s energy policy. The targets for
the promotion of renewable energies and combined heat and power,
are collected in 2005-2010 Renewable Energies Plan and the
Strategy of Energy Saving and Efficiency in Spain (E4),
respectively. In view thereof it is found that although experienced
by all the special arrangements for electricity generation has been
remarkable growth in certain technologies, the objectives are still far
from being achieved.

. the activity of electricity production in the special regime is
characterized by the possibility that its remuneration is
supplemented by charging a premium on the terms established by
regulation, the determination of which takes into account factors
such as the voltage level of the power delivery grid, contribution to
the improvement of the environment, the primary energy savings,
energy efficiency and investment costs that are incurred.

A change to the economic and legal framework governing the
special regime in force to date is necessary for several reasons:
Firstly, the growth experienced by the special regime in recent years,
coupled with the experience gained during the implementation of
Royal Decrees 2818/1998, of December 23, and 436/2004, of
March 12, has revealed the need to regulate certain technical aspects
in order to contribute to the growth of these technologies,
safeguarding security in the electrical system and ensuring quality
in the delivery of the same, and also to minimize restrictions on the
production of said generation. The economic regime established by
Royal Decree 436/2004, of March 12, owing to the changes
experienced by market prices, which in recent times have been more
greatly affected by certain variables not considered in the above
remuneration scheme of the special regime, makes modification of
the remuneration scheme necessary, separating it from the Average
or Benchmark Electricity Tariff, used to date. Finally, the
regulatory changes resulting from European legislation, as well as
the Royal Decree-Act 7/2006, of June 23, must be included, by
means of which urgent measures were adopted in the energy sector,
introducing significant changes regarding the legal regime of the
combined heat and power activity.

The present Royal Decree replaces Royal Decree 436/2004, of
March 12, which defined the methodology for updating and the
systematization of the legal and economic framework for electricity
production activity under the special regime, while maintaining the
basic structure of the regulations therein.

The economic framework established in this Royal Decree
implements the principles contained in Act 54/1997, of November
27, on the Electricity Sector, guaranteeing owners of facilities in the
special regime a reasonable return for their investment and the
consumers of electricity an allocation of the costs attributable to the
electrical system that is also reasonable, while participation is
encouraged in the market, since it is considered that under this
framework, government intervention on the pricing of electricity
will be reduced, as well as better more efficient and allocation of
costs arising from the system, especially with regard to the handling
of deviations and additional services. (Emphasis added)

RD 661/2007 implemented a remuneration regime pursuant to which a qualifying Special
Regime generator could choose between selling its electricity output at either: (a) a fixed
regulated tariff (in euro cents per kWh) at the same rate for all scheduling periods (i.e. a
FiT option) (Article 24(1)(a)); or (6) the pool price plus a fixed premium payment (in euro
cents per kWh) over and above the pool price (i.e. a FiP option) (Article 24(1)(b)).

25

104.

105.

106.

107.

The generators could choose between these two options — the “regulated tariff” or the “pool
price plus premium” on an annual basis (Article 24(4)). The Special Regime producers
were entitled to obtain the regulated tariff or the pool price plus premium for all of their

electricity output (measured in kWh), without any limit on production.

By contrast with RD 436/2004, the fixed regulated tariff and premium under RD 661/2007
were not calculated by reference to annual TMR values. It disassociated subsidies from

the TMR and updated them annually based on an adjusted CPI.

In relation to the “pool price plus premium” option, RD 661/2007 introduced a cap and
floor mechanism, by establishing upper and lower limit values for the sum of the hourly
market price plus a “reference” premium, so that the actual premium for each hour could
be limited by reference to those values. Pursuant to this mechanism, when the hourly pool
prices were excessively low, installations were guaranteed a minimum level of
remuneration (the lower limit or “floor”’). When the pool prices reached, or exceeded, the
defined upper limit or “cap”, the actual hourly premium payable was zero (thereby

imposing no extra burden on the electricity system) (explanatory preamble).

Hydropower installations had the right to receive the feed-in remuneration for their
operational life, either at the regulated tariff or the pool price plus premium — at a particular
rate during its first 25 years of operation, after which the feed-in remuneration would

continue for the lifetime of the installation, but at a lower rate.

RD 661/2007 also provided for an inflation adjustment mechanism pursuant to which the
values of the regulated tariff, premium, and lower and upper limits provided for in
RD 661/2007 were to be updated on a yearly basis to reflect increases in the Spanish CPI
(Article 44(1)). For the installations in category “b” (including hydropower installations
in groups b.4 and b.5), this was to be done by reference to the increase in the CPI, less

25 basis points up to 31 December 2012 and 50 basis points thereafter (Article 44(1)).

RD 661/2007 (C-0033t). The Respondent's translation (R-007It) is:

Pursuant to its First Transitional Provision, Special Regime installations previously subject
to the incentive scheme set out in RD 436/2004 and which entered into commercial
operations before | January 2008 were granted the right to choose between: (J) benefiting
from the remuneration regime in RD 661/2007 from the date it entered into force
(1 June 2007); or (2) applying the prior remuneration regime of RD 436/2004, subject to
certain conditions and in some cases during a transitional period. Under choice (2), there
were two further options: (i) if the RD 436/2004 option chosen was “regulated tariff’, then
the regulated tariff regime of RD 436/2004 would apply for the remainder of the
installation’s lifetime; or (ii) if the installation chose the “market price plus premium
and incentive” option, the economic regime for that option would apply until
31 December 2012, after which (from 1 January 2013) the feed-in remuneration scheme
under RD 661/2007 (with a right to choose annually between the regulated tariff and the

pool price plus premium options) was to apply.

The Claimants say that most of the Claimants’ hydropower installations chose option (2)(ii)
under the RD 436/2004 regime (except two installations in the Xana Portfolio which chose
option (1), to benefit from the RD 661/2007 feed-in remuneration regime from the date
RD 661/2007 entered into force). Those installations which chose option (2)(ii) were
remunerated under the “market price plus premium and incentive” of RD 436/2004 until
31 December 2012, and from | January 2013, were expected to start receiving the feed-in
remuneration of RD 661/2007 (i.e. either the “regulated tariff’ or the “pool price

plus premium’).

Article 44(3) contemplated a review of the tariffs, premiums and lower and upper limits
every four years, starting from 2010, to determine whether those incentives still reflected
a particular technology’s costs, market participation and a reasonable return for the

investor. It provided (according to the Claimants’ translation“):

Spain (E4), together with such new targets as may be included in the
subsequent Renewable Energies Plan for the period 2011-2020,
there will be a revision of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and
lower and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree, considering the
costs associated with each of these technologies, the degree of
participation of the Special Regime in covering the demand and its
impact upon the technical and economic management of the system,
always guaranteeing reasonable rates of return with reference to the
cost of money in the capital markets. Thereafter, every four years,
a new revision shall be performed, maintaining the same criteria as
previously.

The revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower
limits indicated in this section shall not affect facilities for which the
commissioning certificate had been granted prior to January 1
of the second year following the year in which the revision had
been performed.

111. RD 1578/2008:° RD 1578/2008 put in place a new remuneration regime applicable to
PV facilities that were not registered by the deadline for RD 661/2007. RD 1578/2008
offered lower tariffs than RD 661/2007. It also provided that the tariffs fixed each quarter
would remain in force for “a maximum period of twenty-five years” (Article 11(5)) and

would be updated as “provided for in Article 44.1 of Royal Decree 661/2007” (Article 12).

112. RD-L 6/2009:*° RD-L 6/2009 amended the Electricity Act 54/1997. Its preamble stated
that (a) the growing tariff deficit was causing serious problems which, in the context of the

current international financial crisis, was having a deep effect on the system and

the degree of participation of the special regime in covering the demand and its impact upon the technical and
economic management of the system, and a reasonable rate of profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference
to the cost of money in the capital markets. Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years,
maintaining the same criteria as previously.

jeopardising not only the financial situation of electricity sector companies but the very
sustainability of the system itself; (6) the imbalance was unsustainable; (c) the trend of
these technologies might put at risk the sustainability of the system in the short term, both
from the economic point of view and its impact on the electricity tariff, as well as from the
technical point of view, compromising the economic feasibility of the installations already
finished, whose working depended on the suitable balance between manageable and non-
manageable generation; and (d) it had become necessary to adopt an urgent measure to
guarantee the necessary legal security for those who have made investments, and to lay the
foundation to establish new economic schemes which afforded fulfilment of the intended
objectives: the fulfilment of some power targets by technology at a reasonable cost to the
consumer and their technological evolution which allowed a gradual reduction of their

costs and therefore of their competition with the conventional technologies.

113. RD-L 6/2009 was aimed at eliminating the tariff deficit by 1 January 2013. It provided
that enrolment (which was subject to conditions) on a “pre-assignment of payment register”
established by the Decree-Law would be necessary to obtain the right to take advantage of
the Special Regime under RD 661/2007. It also allowed Spain to introduce restrictions on
the number of registered installations which could begin operating if renewable energy

targets were exceeded (Article 4(2)).

114. EU Directive 2009/28/EC:“’ The Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from
renewable sources repealed Directive 2001/77/EC and increased the EU’s community-
wide target for total energy from renewable sources from 12% by 2010 to 20% by 2020,
and a minimum target of 10% for each Member State. Member States were required to

adopt a National Action Plan for the implementation of the Directive and its targets.

(C-0102 and RL-0017) (“EU Directive 2009/28/EC”).

29

115. 2010 Renewable Energy Promotion Plan, 30 June 2010 (“2011-2020 PER”):** The
2011-2020 PER stated that the then-existing remuneration framework for renewable

energies was “stable, predictable, flexible, controllable and secure for developers and the

electricity system”;*? electrical energy production under the special procedure was founded

on three basic principles, namely “legal certainty, feasibility and regulatory stability”;

and any present or future economic remuneration system to support the generation of
electricity from renewable sources would be based on those principles. It also stressed that

the system was intended to guarantee a reasonable return (emphasis added):

Royal Decree 661/2007 of 26 May 2007 regulating electrical
energy production under the special regime, implements the
Electricity Sector Act Law 54/1997 and defines the legal and
economic regime for electrical energy and cogeneration plants and
plants that use renewable energies and waste as raw material, with
the overarching objective of establishing a stable and predictable
system that guarantees a reasonable return on electrical energy
production under the special regime.*!

The economic framework, currently implemented by Royal Decree
661/2007 of 25 May 2007 regulating electrical energy production
under the Special Regime, and Order ITC/3519/2009 of
28 December 2009 reviewing access fees as from 01 January 2010
along with the tariffs and premiums corresponding to special regime
installations, provide for electricity generation remuneration levels
that afford a reasonable return on investment. In determining those
levels, account is taken of the specific technical and economic
aspects of each technology, installed capacity and the date operation
commenced, in all cases using criteria of system economic
sustainability and efficiency.»

Royal Decree 661/2007 provides for reviews of remuneration
amounts every four years, which may be modified on the basis of

technological developments within the sectors, market behaviour,
degree of compliance with renewable energy targets, percentage of
demand covered by special regime facilities and their effect on the
technical and economic management of the system, while always
guaranteeing reasonable rates of return. In any event, these
reviews take account of cost trends associated with each technology
with three objectives in mind: to see that renewable technologies
become as competitive as possible with Ordinary Regime
generation, to foster a technological development balance and to see
that the remunerative scheme moves in the direction of minimising
socio-economic and environmental costs.*

Technical parameters and investment costs incurred will be
considered in determining remuneration with a view to providing a
reasonable rate of return referenced to the cost of money on the
capital market in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity
Sector Act.

Also, effective administrative supervision is required to assure that
gains from the development of these technologies in terms of
relative cost competitiveness are passed on to society, thus
minimising the speculative risks posed in the past by excessive rates
of return, which not only hurts consumers but is also damaging to
the industry in general in terms of the perception people have of it.
Therefore, it will be necessary to devise sufficiently flexible and
transparent systems that permit the issue and reception of economic
and market signals so as to minimise the risks associated with
investment and its remuneration and those caused by fluctuations in
the energy markets.~

116. From 2010 there was a fall in electricity demand, which increased the tariff deficit. As the

International Energy Agency said later:

The tariff deficit, which had been accumulating since 2001, began
to spiral out of control after 2005. From 2005 to 2013, the costs in
the electricity system grew by 221% while revenues increased by
only 100%. Subsidies for renewable electricity are the single largest
cost element. By 2012, the accumulated debt in the system had
reached more than EUR 20 billion and was set to expand by billions
every year unless action was taken. In 2012, the government
temporarily eliminated subsidies for new installations. It also

reduced remuneration for transmission and distribution network

activities, increased access tariffs, and introduced a 7% tax on

electricity generation (22% for hydropower). Nevertheless, the

deficit grew to EUR 26 billion by the end of 2012.°°
RD 1565/2010:°° RD 1565/2010 capped the quantity of electricity produced by PV plants
(inter alia) which was eligible to receive incentive tariffs and eliminated the tariffs after
25 years of operation, which was later extended to 28 years and then to 30 years (by
RD-L 14/2010 and Act 2/2011). RD 1565/2010 also imposed a reduction in the tariff rate

available to certain facilities enrolling in the RD 1578/2008 regime.

RD 1614/2010:°’ RD 1614/2010 affected only wind and concentrating solar power
(“CSP”) facilities. Its preamble stated that the legal regime must be adapted, safeguarding
the legal security of investments and “the principle of reasonable return”, to maintain a
necessary and sufficient support which was coherent with market conditions and strategic
energy objectives on energy to contribute to the transfer to society of the benefits from the

suitable evolution of these technologies.

RD 1614/2010 reduced premium values under RD 661/2007, although it provided for a
transitional period according to which qualifying installations could remain under the prior
regulatory regime until the end of 2012. It also limited the number of hours of operation

amenable to premium if certain caps were surpassed.

RD-L 14/2010:°* RD-L 14/2010 introduced urgent measures to correct the tariff deficit.
The preamble stated:

Since the adoption of [RD-L 6/2009], there have been a series of

anticipated tariff deficit in the electricity system and it has been
determined that the capped ex ante deficit limits, as established in
the aforementioned Twenty-First Additional Provision, have been
largely overcome. The impact of the global crisis, which traverses
the Spanish economy, has led to a significant decline in the demand
for electric energy, however, supply has been impacted by aspects
such as the evolution of the price of fuels on the international
markets during the current year, 2010 and the favourable climatic
conditions that have led to increased electric energy production from
renewable sources. The current economic situation has not had
symmetrical consequences in all electric power sectors: while the
ordinary regime (traditional electric power plants) have seen a
reduction in their operating hours and income, due to the decline in
wholesale market prices, however, producers under the special
regime are found to be in a different circumstance, as this specific
regime ensures the sale of generated electricity at preferential rates
within the system.

121. The preamble also stated that it was enacted “in consideration of the rate of growth of
photovoltaic installations” and that the PV sector was a major contributor to the regulated
costs of the electricity system as a consequence of the objectives being exceeded.
It imposed a temporary three-year cap on the number of operating hours during which
PV installations were entitled to the RD 661/2007 tariff, in exchange for a three-year
extension of the 25-year tariff term (which was later extended by a further two years by
Act 2/2011). It also imposed an access fee (of EUR 0.50/MWh) on all producers (including

small-hydro installations) for access to transmission and distribution networks.

122. Act 2/2011 on Sustainable Economy:*’ Act 2/2011 (March 2011) outlined the need to
undertake a reform in energy regulation in general and the incentives for the Special
Regime in particular. Section 78(1) set a minimum national goal of 20% for the
participation of renewable energies in gross energy consumption for the year 2020; and the
target was to be attained with an energy quota from renewable energies in all kinds of
transmission by 2020 that was equivalent to at least 10% of the final energy consumption

in the transmission sector.

C. Supreme Court Decisions Prior to the Claimants’ Investment

123. 15 December 2005:°! The Supreme Court, in a challenge against RD 436/2004, said that:
“No legal obstacle exists for the Government, in the exercise of the regulatory power and
the large authorisations which it has in a heavily regulated field such as electricity, to

modify a particular compensation system ...”.
124. 25 October 2006: The Supreme Court, in a challenge against RD 2351/2004, ruled:

the owners of electrical energy production facilities under the
special regime do not have an “unmodifiable right” to maintain
unchanged the way in which the collection of premiums is governed.
This regime actually attempts to promote the use of renewable
energies by means of an incentive mechanism which, like any of this
kind, is not guaranteed to be retained without amendments in the
future ... In the same way that, according to factors of economic
policy ... the premiums and incentives for the production of electric
energy under the special scheme can increase from one year to the
next, they can also decrease when those same considerations make
it advisable. As long as, we repeat, the variations are kept within
the legal limits that govern this mode of promotion, the mere fact
that the updating or financial significance of the premium may
increase or decrease does not constitute, by itself, reason for nullity,
nor does it affect the legitimate expectations of the recipients.”°

125. The Supreme Court also said:

legal certainty is not incompatible with the regulatory changes from
the perspective of the validity of the latter ... The same
consideration applies to the principle of legitimate expectations ...
The appellants argue that their investments in the activity of
production of electrical energy under the special regime were made
at a given time “trusting that the Administration will not change the
legal conditions that were decisive for ... them to decide to build the

facility,” a premise from which they infer that the reduction of
premiums subsequent to RD 2351/2004 regarding those established
in RD 435/2004 would be contrary to that principle. Such
reasoning, based on an incentive mechanism as that of the premiums
in question, cannot be shared ...

Until it is replaced by another one, the aforementioned Act
(Article 30 of Electricity Sector Act) enables the corresponding
companies to pursue premiums that include, as a relevant factor, the
achievement of “reasonable rate of return with reference to the cost
of money on the capital market” or, to once again use the words of
the preamble to RD 436/2004, “fair remuneration for their
investments”. The remuneration regime which we examine does not
guarantee, on the contrary, holders of facilities under special regime
the inviolability of a certain level of returns or income in relation to
those obtained in past years, nor the indefinite permanence of
formulas used for fixing premiums.

126. 20 March 2007® (a decision on amendments to RD 2818/1998) and 9 October 2007%
(a challenge to RD 1454/2005): the Supreme Court confirmed that there is no vested right

to receive a specific subsidy in the future.

127. 3 December 2009 and 9 December 2009:°* These were challenges to the replacement of
RD 436/2004 by RD 661/2007. In the former decision the Supreme Court stated:

the prescriptive content of Act 54/1997 ... does not envisage the
petrifaction or freezing of the remunerative regime of owners of
electricity facilities under the special regime, nor any recognition of
the right of producers under the special regime to the
unmodifiability of that regime, given that the Government, as
intended by the legislator, possesses a discretion power to determine
the energy remunerations that are offered ... taking into account, in
the exercise of its regulatory powers the evident and essential

general interests implied in the proper functioning of the system of

128. There was no breach of the principle of legal certainty because:

it is not deduced that said regulation [RD 661/2007] does not
respond to the demands of the principle of legal certainty, which
does not include any right to freezing of the existent legal order ...

[T]here are no grounds for challenging Transitory provision one,
section 4 of the RD contested, of infringing the principle of
legitimate expectations, given that the mercantile companies
appealing, as companies that operate in the electricity production
business ... do not have a right for the remunerative regime of the
electricity sector to remain unaltered. ... as we upheld in the
Judgement of this Chamber of Contentious-Administrative Matters
of the Supreme Court of 15 December 2005, “there is no legal
obstacle to prevent the Government, in the exercise of regulatory
powers and broad entitlements that it has in such a strongly regulated
matter as electricity, from modifying a specific system of
remuneration providing that this remains within the framework

established through the Electricity Sector Act”.”°

129. In relation to legitimate expectation, the Court said: “The principle of legitimate
expectations does not guarantee the perpetuation of the existing situation; which can be

modified at the discretion of the institutions and public authorities to impose new

regulations taking into account the needs of the general interest.””!

130. In the second decision, 9 December 2009, on two challenges against RD 661/2007, the

Court said:

... [The Claimant] does not pay sufficient attention to the case-law

legitimate expectations and non-retroactivity applied to successive

considerations expressed in our Ruling of 25 October 2006 and
reiterated in that of 20 March 2007, inter alia, on the legal status of
the owners of facilities producing electricity under the special
regime, for whom it is not possible to recognise pro futuro an
‘unalterable right’ to the maintenance of the remuneration
framework approved by the holder of regulatory power, provided
that the prescriptions of the LSE regarding the reasonable rate of
return of the investments are respected.’

131. The Court also said:

Any companies that freely choose to enter a market such as the
special regime electricity production market, knowing in advance
that it is largely dependent upon economic incentives established by
public authorities, are or must be aware that these may be modified,
within legal guidelines, by these authorities. One of the “regulatory
risks” to which they are subject, which they must necessarily take
into account, is precisely the variation of the parameters of the
premiums or incentives, which the Electricity Sector Act — in the
sense above — tempers but does not exclude ...

It should be noted that the establishment of the economic regime for
facilities operating under the special electricity production regime,
proposed by RD 661/2007, of 25 March, cannot be described as
arbitrary, since it is conditional upon the objective of
ensuring reasonable rate of return throughout the useful life of these
facilities, so that the Government, pursuant to Article 15.2 of
Act 54/1997, of 27 November, of the Electricity Sector, is
authorised to approve the methodology for calculating and
updating the remuneration of said activity with objective,
transparent and non-discriminatory objectives ...7°

D. The Disputed Measures

133. On7 March 2012, the CNE issued Report 2/2012 recommending measures to address the

tariff deficit.” It said:

The Spanish electrical system has recorded a structural deficit in the
revenues from regulated activities (tariff deficit) for a decade, due
to the fact that the costs that have been recognised for the various
regulated activities and costs have been (and continue to be) higher
than the revenues obtained from the regulated prices paid by
consumers.

the current situation is unsustainable. The introduction of
regulatory measures, as requested by the document of the SEE, is
called for with immediate effect in the short term, in order to
eliminate the deficit of the system, mitigate the cost of funding the
yet unsecuritised debt and clearly define the access costs that will be
assumed by electricity consumers, in order to determine their access
tariffs in a satisfactory and stable manner.’°

134. On 20 July 2012 Spain and the EU signed a Memorandum of Understanding, in which

Spain committed to “address the electricity tariff deficit in a comprehensive way.”””

135. RD-L 1/2012:’8 RD-L 1/2012 eliminated feed-in remuneration under RD 661/2007 for
new plants, and suspended new RAIPRE registrations.” Facilities which, at the time of the
entry into force of RD-L 1/2012, had been finally registered in the RAIPRE were excluded
from its scope of application. The preamble restated the efforts made by RD-L 6/2009 and

RD-L 14/2010 to address the tariff deficit, and stated that (a) the measures adopted so far
had not been sufficient, and the final purpose of eliminating the tariff deficit as from 2013
was still in jeopardy; (b) it was therefore considered appropriate to withdraw the economic
incentives for certain special regime facilities and for certain ordinary regime facilities
using similar technologies, as well as to suspend the remuneration pre-allocation
procedures established for them, in order to address the problem of the electricity sector
high tariff deficit in a more favourable environment; (c) by adopting this measure, the
Government had chosen to limit its scope to special regime facilities not yet registered,
except where such condition was due to the Administration’s failure to comply with the
relevant time limit for making a decision; and (d) it had been decided to limit the scope of
the measure in order to prevent it from affecting investments already made with regard to

ordinary regime facilities, not subject to the pre-allocation scheme.

Act 15/2012:°° Act 15/2012 (27 December 2012) on tax measures for energy sustainability
introduced a 7% tax on all revenue received from the generation of electricity (“TWPEE”),
whether from conventional or renewable sources. The preamble stated that this measure
was introduced to address tariff imbalance and to meet environmental concerns: “The
purpose of this act is to harmonize our fiscal system with more efficient and

environmentally-respectful use and sustainability, which are the values that have inspired

 

this

 

scal reform, and as such, in line with the basic principles that govern the fiscal,

energy, and of course environmental policy of the European Union.”

By Article 1: “The tax on the value of electric power generation is a tax of direct and real
nature that charges the performance of activities of production and incorporation of electric
power into the electrical system, measured in power plant busbars, through each one of the

facilities indicated in Article 4 of this Act.”

By Article 4(1): “The taxable event is the production and incorporation into the electrical

system of electrical power measured at the busbars...”

139. Act 15/2012 provided that an amount equal to that collected through the TVPEE would be
allocated to finance the costs of the Electricity System (Second Additional Provision).
It also created three additional taxes, which are not in issue: (i) a tax on production of spent
nuclear fuel and radioactive waste, (ii) a tax on storage of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive

waste, and (iii) a levy on use of continental waters for electricity production.

140. Act 15/2012 inserted a new provision, Article 112 bis, in RD-L 1/2001 (the Spanish Water
Act), imposing a new levy on hydropower concessionaires (i.e. hydropower producers) for
using the inland public hydraulic domain to produce electricity (the “Water Levy’). The
rate applicable to small-hydro facilities with an installed capacity equal to or less than
50 MW (which includes all hydropower installations in which the Claimants hold
investments) was 2.2% of the economic value of all hydroelectricity produced using the

public hydraulic domain in each annual period.

141. Act 17/2012:*! Act 17/2012 on the general state budget supplemented Act 15/2012 and
earmarked an amount equivalent to the tax collected under Act 15/2012 to fund the costs

of the electricity system related to promotion of renewable energy.

142. RD-L 2/2013 and MO IET/221/2013 implementing RD-L 2/2013:*? The preamble of
RD-L 2/2013 recognised “the dual objective of guaranteeing reasonable profitability for

these facilities and, at the same time, avoid their over-remuneration” and said:

The information provided by [CNE] indicates new variations in the
estimates for costs and revenues for 2012 and 2013 year end due to
various factors which, in the current economic environment, would
make it practically impossible to cover them with a charge to the
electricity tariffs and to the categories envisaged in the General State
Budgets.

These variations are due in large part to a significant rise in the cost
of the special regime due to the operating hours increasing more than
anticipated and due to an increase in the remuneration values due to

their indexation to the Brent price, and a decrease in revenues from
tolls due to the sharp drop in demand this year.

The alternative proposed would be a new increase in the access tolls
which pay electricity consumers. This measure would directly
affect household economies and the competitiveness of companies
which are both in a delicate situation due to the current economic
situation.

Faced with this scenario, in order to mitigate the situation, the

government has contemplated adopting certain urgent cost reduction

measures which prevent putting new strain on consumers, allowing

them, through consumption and investment, to also collaborate in

the economy’s recovery.
RD-L 2/2013 effectively eliminated the premium under the “pool price plus premium”
option under RD 661/2007 and replaced the CPI-linked updating index in RD 661/2007
with a lower index: (1) it ascribed a new value” of “zero” per kWh to the reference
premiums (and caps and floors) applicable to Special Regime installations (including
small-hydro) under RD 661/2007; (2) if a Special Regime facility opted to sell electricity
under the “pool price” option (without premium), it would no longer be entitled to choose
the regulated tariff option during the remainder of its operational life; and (3) with effect
from 1 January 2013, it replaced the CPI used for making the annual updates in
RD 661/2007 with a “CPI at constant tax rates and excluding unprocessed foods and energy
products”, the effect of which was that any annual updates to the feed-in remuneration
would no longer reflect any variations in the tax rates or inflation in relation to the prices

of unprocessed foods and energy products.

On 14 February 2013, Spain implemented several of these changes through the approval
of Order 221/2013,** which dealt with the access tolls, tariffs and premiums for Special

Regime facilities.

RD-L 9/2013:** RD-L 9/2013, effective as of 14 July 2013, repealed RD 661/2007. It

and substituted a system providing for “specific remuneration” based on “standard” costs

per unit of installed power, plus standard amounts for operating costs.
146. The preamble stated:

... for a decade the Spanish electric system has been generating a
tariff deficit which, over time, has become structural due to the fact
that the real costs associated with the regulated activities and the
functioning of the electric sector are higher than the revenues from
the tariffs set by the state and which consumers pay.

Between 2004 and 2012 the electric system’s revenues from tolls on
consumers increased 122%, while the increase in the system’s
regulated costs in the aforementioned period was 197%. Of the
costs which have contributed to the largest extent to said increase,
the special regime premiums and the annuities of accumulated
deficits stand out as costs which have multiplied by six and by nine
respectively over the aforementioned period.

According to the most recent data available from the Spanish
National Commission for Energy [CNE] the cumulative debt
balance amounted to €26,062.51 million at May 10, 2013. As a
supplement to the calculation of the electric system’s debt, the CNE
points out that from 2003 and until May 10, 2013, the amount to be
paid to finance the electric system’s deficit through the annuities
included in the access tolls on consumers, at updated prices for each
year, amounts to €11,823 million.

These figures show the unsustainable nature of the electric sector’s
deficit and the need to adopt urgent measures effective immediately
which bring this situation to an end.*>

147. Article 1 substituted a new Article 30(4) in the Electricity Act 54/1997:

In addition and under the terms which are determined in a regulatory
manner by royal decree of the Council of Ministers, the
remuneration for the sale of energy generated valued at market
price, the facilities may receive a specific remuneration composed
by a term per unit of installed capacity which covers, where
applicable, the investment costs for a standard facility that cannot be
recovered through the sale of energy and a term to the operation
which covers, if applicable, the difference between the operating

85 RD-L 9/2013 (C-01071), preamble.

42

costs and the revenues from this standard facility participating in
the market.

To calculate said specific remuneration for a standard facility
throughout its regulatory useful life and based on the activity
performed by an efficient and well-managed company, the
following will be taken into account:

a) The standard revenues from the sale of energy generated valued
at the production market price.

b) The standard operating costs.
c) The standard value of the initial investment.

For these purposes, under no circumstances will costs or
investments which are determined by regulations or administrative
actions which are not applicable throughout Spain be taken into
account. Similarly, only the costs and investments which
correspond exclusively to the activity of producing electric energy
will be taken into account.

This remuneration regime will not exceed the minimum level
necessary to cover the costs which allow the facilities to compete on
equal footing with the other technologies on the market and which
allow a reasonable profitability to be obtained with reference to the
standard facility applicable in each case. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the remuneration regime may exceptionally also include
an investment and execution incentive within a specific period when
the facility represents a significant reduction of costs in island and
nonmainland systems.

This reasonable profitability will be based on the average yield in
the secondary market of ten-year government bonds applying the

appropriate spread, before taxes.

The parameters of the remuneration regime may be reviewed every
six years.®°

8 RD-L 9/2013 (C-01078), Article 1.

43

148. The reasonable profitability provision was as follows:

First additional provision. Reasonable profitability of the
production facilities with the right to a premium economic
regime.

Pursuant to that envisaged in the second-to-last paragraph of
article 30.4 of Electricity Act 1997, for facilities which, upon the
entry into force of this royal decree-law, had the right to a premium
economic regime, a profitability before taxes is established based on
the average yield over the last ten years in the secondary market of
ten-year government bonds, increased by 300 basis points, all of the
foregoing without prejudice to the review envisaged in the last
paragraph of said article.

149. Details were left to be determined by implementing decrees.

150. Act 24/2013:8’ Act 24/2013, December 2013, superseded the Electricity Act 54/1997. It
removed the distinction between Ordinary and Special Regimes under RD 661/2007.

According to the preamble:

. a crucial factor in this reform has been the accumulation of
annual imbalances between revenues and costs for the electric
system over the last decade, resulting in a structural deficit.

This imbalance is due to excessive growth in certain costs as a result
of energy policy decisions, with no guarantee of revenues for the
system. This situation has been exacerbated by the absence of
growth in demand for electricity, due for the most part to the
economic crisis.

... Such is this imbalance that the electric system as a whole has
debts of more than twenty-six thousand million euros, a structural
deficit of ten thousand million euros a year, and a failure to correct
the imbalance has resulted in the prospect of the electric system
going bankrupt.

Act 54/1997, of November 27, has proven insufficient to ensure the
financial equilibrium of the system due, among other reasons, to the
fact that the system for the remuneration of regulated activities has
not had the flexibility required to adapt to important changes in the
electric system or changes in the economy.

87 Act 24/2013, on the Electric Power Sector, 26 December 2013 (C-0085 and R-0047) (“Act 24/2013”).

44

Thus, the experience of the last decade has revealed that the
economic and financial instability of the electric system the result of
the tariff deficit has made it impossible to guarantee the stable
regulatory framework needed for the correct development of a
highly investment-intensive activity such as electricity production.

Thus, the economic unsustainability of the electric system, together
with the constant evolution of the sector over the last sixteen years,
has forced the legislature to adapt Act 54/1997, of November 27, on
the Electric Power Sector on a number of occasions, often via the
approval of urgent measures by Royal Decree-Law. At present,
there is a degree of normative dispersion that is undesirable in such
an important sector of the economy.

In short, constant rule changes have significantly distorted the
normal operation of the electric system, a distortion that must be
corrected via action by the legislature that provides the regulatory
stability required for electricity production. This regulatory
security, together with the need to undertake the reforms required in
order to ensure the sustainability of the system in the long-term and
to resolve the aforementioned problems in the operation of the
system, warrant approval for a reform of the sector as a whole, based
on a new regime of revenue and expenditure for the electric system
designed to return to the system a financial sustainability it lost long
ago, and which it has not been possible to restore to date via the
adoption of partial measures.

The remuneration regime for renewable energies, cogeneration, and
recycling waste will be based on the necessary participation of these
facilities in the market, with market revenue to be topped up with a
specific level of regulated remuneration that allows these
technologies to compete on a level playing field with all other
technologies on the market. This specific additional remuneration
will be sufficient to cover costs that, unlike conventional
technologies, these technologies cannot recover from the market,
and will enable them to achieve a reasonable return by reference to
the standard facility applicable in each case.**

151. The object of the new regime of revenue and expenditure for the electric system was

electricity supplies and adapt them to the needs of consumers in terms of security, quality,

efficiency, objectivity, and transparency, at the lowest possible minimum cost.”

Act 24/2013 eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary and Special Regimes, on the
basis that renewables producers were on the same footing as conventional power
generators, except as expressly provided. It provided for a special payment remuneration
scheme subject to revision every six years, with the base line predictions reviewed every

three years.

Pending implementing regulations (RD on renewable production, subsequently
RD 413/2014; and Ministerial Order on remuneration parameters, subsequently

MO IET/1045/2014*?) were to apply from their date of enactment to 14 July 2013.

RD 413/2014:°° RD 413/2014 established the new regime, and MO IET/1045/2014 gave
details of the new compensation formulas. Together, RD-L 9/2013, Law 24/2013,
RD 413/2014, and MO IET/1045/2014 comprised the “New Regime”.

RD 413/2014 stated in Article 1 that its purpose was “to provide a legal and economic
framework for the electricity generation activity from renewable energy sources ...” It was
to apply “to facilities from renewable energy sources which [did] not reach the minimum
level to cover those costs that allow[ed] them to compete on equal terms with the other
technologies in the market obtaining a reasonable profitability in the standard facility

applicable in each case” (Article 11(2)).

To determine the specific remuneration scheme applicable in each case, every facility
depending on its features was to have an assigned standard facility, and the remuneration
for each facility was to be obtained from the remuneration parameters for the standard
facility and the features of the actual facility (Article 11(4), (5)). By Article 19, reasonable

profitability for the standard facility was to be calculated as the average yield of ten-year

before the regulatory period increased by one differential. It was to be based on a standard

installation with an operational life of 25 years.

157. Tariff payments received prior to the inception of the New Regime were to be
counted towards the total remuneration which an installation might receive over its deemed
operational life, to determine whether the plant had received a reasonable return. If the
installation surpassed the “reasonable return” (7.398%), it would not receive

further subsidies.

158. MO IET/1045/2014:"! This Ministerial Order (consisting of some 1760 pages) also
referred in its preamble to a remuneration model which “ensur[es] the facilities’ reasonable
profitability.” It set the remuneration parameters for “standard” facilities, including the
estimated “standard costs” applied under the new regulatory regime, and the criteria for
“standard installations” for different types of renewable. Under Annex III of the Order,
the target rate of return for renewable energy producers is set at 7.398% pre-tax. This value
will apply until 31 December 2019 (until the end of the first regulatory period running from
12 July 2013), and is then subject to discretionary reviews for subsequent regulatory
periods.*? Order 1045 limits payment of the specific remuneration for small-hydro
installations to the regulatory useful life of a hydropower plant, which has been set at

25 years, after which projects will receive no specific remuneration.

MO IET/1344/2015:°* MO IET/1344/2015 modified MO IET/1045/2014 to reduce the

period of regulatory useful life of certain hydropower facilities.

RD 198/2015:°° RD 198/2015, 23 March 2015 further developed Article 112 bis of the
Spanish Water Act, and limited the scope of application of the Water Levy to hydropower
plants located in inter-regional river basins. As with the TVPEE, the Water Levy is applied
on the gross value (i.e. the total amount in euros) to be received by the hydropower
producer, and was aimed at increasing the electricity system’s revenues at the expense of

hydroelectric producers. It also has a disproportionate impact on hydropower plants.

The overall effect was to eliminate the Special Regime generators’ entitlement to the
regulated tariff. The only option now available to renewable energy generators is to sell
their entire electricity output at market prices, with the possibility “under exceptional

circumstances””*

of receiving from the State an additional specific remuneration, which
may include one or both of the following elements: (J) a “remuneration to investment”
(investment incentive) (RIN), per MW of installed capacity, seeking, in theory, to cover
the hypothetical investment costs of a “standard facility” that cannot be met by market
prices; and (2) a “remuneration to operation” (operating incentive) (ROP), per MWh of
electricity produced, seeking to cover the hypothetical operating costs of a “standard
facility” (a hypothetical efficient plant) which cannot be met by market prices. (J) is
calculated on the basis of standard historical values of the operation and performance of a
“standard facility” throughout its regulatory lifespan, so that it theoretically reaches a target
return; and (2) is only received by facilities which have not exceeded a certain number of
years of operation (25 years, in the case of small-hydro). Remuneration parameters

(including the rate of return) may be revised every three or six years, including for existing

 

applicable to certain facilities of power production from renewable sources of energy, cogeneration and waste,
2 July 2015 (C-0083) (“MO IET 1344/2015”).

163. If the return before July 2013 exceeded the target return, the installation will not be entitled
to the regulated revenue even though the scheme did not then exist, as if the scheme had
then been in existence. If the installation passed the “reasonable return” test (7.398%) it

will not receive further subsidies.**

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS ON JURISDICTION
The Respondent has raised two objections to jurisdiction in this case.

First, the Respondent submits that the Claimants are not “investors of another Contracting
Party” as required under Article 26 of the ECT because the Claimants are incorporated in
EU Member States and the Respondent is also an EU Member State. Given that Spain has
not consented to the arbitration of disputes involving an EU Member State and nationals
of other EU Member States (“‘intra-EU disputes”), the Claimants cannot be considered as

protected investors and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction ratione personae.'"!

Second, concerning the TVPEE and the Water Levy, the Respondent argues that the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to consider (a) breaches of Article 10(1) of the ECT because of
the taxation carve-out in Article 21 of the ECT; and (b) breaches of other standards of
protection, given the inapplicability of the Most Favored Nation (“MEN”) treatment
standard of Article 10(7) of the ECT in this case.'°? The Respondent acknowledges that
the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear an alleged violation of Article 13 of the ECT in relation

to the TVPEE and the Water Levy. !°

The Claimants request the Tribunal to dismiss the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections. First, they submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione personae under the
ECT.' Second, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear claims
concerning the TVPEE and the Water Levy because (a) as non-genuine bona fide
measures, they do not fall within the tax carve-out of Article 21 of the ECT; and (b) even
if they were considered genuine bona fide taxes, they would be taxes for which Spain must

comply with its MFN obligation of Article 10(7) of the ECT.'™

A. First Objection: Lack of Jurisdiction over an Intra-EU Dispute

The Respondent’s jurisdictional objection concerning the alleged inapplicability of
Article 26 of the ECT to intra-EU disputes was first raised in its Counter-Memorial and in
its Rejoinder.'°° On 6 March 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”)
rendered a ruling in the Achmea case.'°’ At the Hearing, the Respondent focused its
jurisdictional arguments on the Achmea ruling.'°® The Claimants did not address the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections at the Hearing and referred the Tribunal to their
written submissions in this regard.'°? The Parties subsequently submitted post-hearing
briefs and additional submissions which included their positions on this objection. A brief

summary of the Parties’ positions regarding the “‘intra-EU” objection is provided below.

(1) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae arguing that
the Claimants are not “investors of another Contracting Party” as required under Article 26
of the ECT because they are incorporated in Luxembourg and Sweden which are
EU Member States and the Respondent is also an EU Member State; besides,
Luxembourg, Sweden and Spain were members of the EU at the time they entered into
the ECT.'!° In the Respondent’s view, the ECT does not apply to disputes relating to

“intra-EU” investments. !!!

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent raised three main arguments in support of this
objection: (a) the EU system confers particular protection upon the EU-national investor,

which is of preferential application over the provisions of the ECT;'!? (b) the prevalence

of EU law among EU Member States is reflected in the literal interpretation, context and

purpose of the ECT;''3 and (c) commentators also support the Respondent's position.!'4

First, the Respondent submits that the ECT is not applicable in this case because the
EU system confers particular and preferential protection upon the EU-national investors
within the framework of the Internal Market in Electricity of the EU.''> According to the
Respondent, the Claimants’ investments were made within the EU’s integral system for
intra-EU investments, which guarantees promotion and protection of those investments

through its institutional and judicial framework.!!®

To decide this arbitration, the Respondent claims that the Tribunal would have to deliver
an opinion on the rights of intra-EU investors as regards Spain and the Internal Market in
Electricity, which would interfere with the competence of the EU judicial system.''? The
Respondent argues that the EU investor protection system prevails over any other national
or international law to regulate intra-EU investments, and therefore this system is “of
preferential application over the provisions of the ECT” in this case.''® The Respondent
argues that prior arbitral tribunals have agreed that in case of conflict between the ECT and

EU law, the latter shall prevail over the former.!!9

Second, the Respondent argues that the prevalence of EU law among EU Member States

is supported by the text, context and purpose of the ECT. !?°

176. Concerning the text of the ECT, the Respondent draws attention, inter alia, to: (a) Article
1(2), which includes Regional Economic Integration Organisations (“REIO”) such as the
EU under the definition of the “Contracting Parties” and Article 1(3), which recognizes the
binding nature of competences conferred to the EU by its member states;!*! (b) Article 16
establishing the rules of compatibility between the ECT and other treaties, including
EU treaties, which prevail over the ECT in intra-EU relations; !2” (c) Article 25 which
prevents the applicability of the EU’s system of preferential treatment to other ECT
Contracting Parties that are not EU Member States via the MEN clause; '”* (d) Article 36(7),
which provides REIOs with votes equivalent to the number of its member states which are
Contracting Parties to the ECT when voting on matters over which it has competence; !7*
and (e) Article 26(6) that requires disputes to be resolved “in accordance with this Treaty
and applicable rules and principles of International law” and means that the Tribunal must
interpret the dispute settlement provision of Article 26 of the ECT in accordance with EU

law, which is applicable international law.'?>

177. Pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal should
consider Article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”),
the application of which prevents Spain from submitting any matters relating to the EU’s
Internal Market in Electricity (such as this dispute) to any dispute settlement method other

than the EU judicial system. !2°

178. Regarding the context of the ECT, the Respondent mentions that at the time the ECT was
signed, the Member States of the then European Community were unable to contract

obligations between them as regards the Internal Market (as it is an area in which they had

transferred their sovereignty to the then European Community) and for this reason the EU
is a Contracting Party to the ECT. Therefore, Article 26 of the ECT does not generate

obligations between the EU Member States. '2”

179. According to the Respondent, the object and purpose of the ECT confirms its intra-EU
dispute objection because admitting intra-EU disputes within the scope of the ECT’s
application would mean that the EU and its Member States promoted the ECT to cover
intra-EU investments which had been already regulated by EU law ina superior manner.!2*
The Respondent contends that such interpretation and application would take away

competencies from the CJEU and lead to mistrust of the EU’s protection system. !”

180. Third, the Respondent claims that its position with regard to the exclusion of intra~EU

disputes from the ECT dispute settlement mechanism is also endorsed by doctrine. '*”

181. In its Rejoinder, the Respondent introduced two further arguments in support of its “intra-
EU” objection: (i) under the “principle of primacy” of EU law in intra-EU relations, it is
EU law and not the ECT which must be applied to resolve this dispute;'*! and (ii) the

Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention in view of the Claimants’

dual nationality. >?

182. First, the Respondent argues that pursuant to the principle of primacy established by the

ECJ in the ruling in 1964 in Costa v ENEL, EU law applies to intra-EU relations

in preference to any other law, “displacing any other national or international provision”.!*>

According to the Respondent, the principle of primacy implies that the

obligations of EU Member States vis-d-vis international treaties are subsidiary to their
obligations to the EU.'** Therefore, for the ECT to be interpreted in conformity with
EU law, the principle of primacy prevents the ECT from incorporating an offer to arbitrate

intra-EU disputes. !*>

Among other arguments, the Respondent submits that: (a) Articles 25 and 26 of the ECT
recognise the primacy of EU law in the context of intra-EU relations (to the extent that
Article 25 refers to “preferential treatment” applicable between the parties to an economic
integration agreement and Article 26 requires the application of EU law to the dispute as it
forms part of the rules and principles of international law applicable to the Parties’ dispute
under Article 26(6));'*° and (b) EU law, not the ECT, should apply because this dispute

affects essential elements of EU law such as State aid.!*”

In relation to its argument about the principle of primacy of EU law, the Respondent
submits that EU law constitutes part of public international law and thus “applicable rules
and principles of international law” under Article 26(6) of the ECT.'** Also, it considers
that “the ECT is part of Union law”. Thus, an arbitral tribunal must necessarily take into

account EU law in its jurisdictional review.'*?

Second, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention because the Claimants hold dual Luxembourg-European and Swedish-
European nationality. According to the Respondent: (a) Article 20 of the TFEU establishes
that all citizens of an EU Member State simultaneously hold European nationality; (b) the
EU and the Member States made an express declaration regarding Article 25 of the ECT
to clarify that that legal persons incorporated in accordance with the legislation of any
Member State should be treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of

the Member States; and (c) Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention precludes natural

persons with dual nationality from filing an arbitration claim.'4° Therefore, the
Respondent argues that because the Claimants hold “dual nationality”, they do not meet

the jurisdictional requirement of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. '4!

At the Hearing and during the post-hearing submissions, the Respondent focused its

jurisdictional arguments on the Achmea ruling. '47

The Respondent submits that this ruling
applies in the context of the ECT and confirms the Respondent’s intra-EU objection in

this case. !43
The Respondent refers to paragraph 60 of the Achmea ruling which reads as follows:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a

provision in an international agreement concluded between Member

States ... under which an investor from one of those Member States

may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other

Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State

before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has

undertaken to accept. '4+
Concerning the relevance of this decision the Respondent mentions, inter alia, the
following: (i) the findings of the ruling are not a novelty but reflect consolidated case law
that dates back to 1991;!*5 (ii) the ruling’s scope of application is not limited to BITs but
it extends to any international treaty, including the ECT; '° (iii) the ruling is applicable in
this case because it concerns an intra-EU dispute in which the Tribunal is obliged to apply

EU law;!“” and (iv) given that the Tribunal does not form part of the EU judicial system

and therefore cannot make a question for a preliminary ruling to the CJEU under

Article 267 of the TFEU, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over this intra-EU dispute.'*

First, the Respondent claims that the CJEU applied a consolidated case law referring to
multilateral treaties that dates back to 1991. According to this case law, the Respondent
notes that the Achmea ruling endorses the following principles: (a) pursuant to Article 344
of the TFEU, an international agreement “cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by
the Treaties in the EU legal system”; (b) EU law has primacy over the laws of the Member
States; (c) pursuant to Article 19 of TFEU, it falls on the national courts and the CJEU to
“ensure the full application of EU law” in order to maintain consistency and uniformity in
the interpretation of EU law; (d) the preliminary ruling system established in Article 267
of the TFEU aims to secure the uniform interpretation of EU law and ensure its consistency;
and (e) EU law is both part of the law of each EU Member State and also derives from an

international agreement between the Member States. '4?

According to the Respondent, the CJEU concluded that these principles were not fulfilled
in Achmea because: (a) the investment arbitration tribunal established may be called upon
to interpret or apply EU law as international applicable law or national law; (b) the tribunal
was not part of the EU judicial system; (c) the tribunal did not meet the classification of a
court of a Member State under the Article 267 of the TFEU and therefore could not make
reference to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling; (d) the tribunal’s decision was final and
judicial review by national courts was limited; (e) the dispute involved investment
arbitration and commercial arbitration case law could not be applied; and (f) the States
involved established a dispute resolution method that could prevent the disputes from being
resolved ensuring the full effectiveness of EU law, even though the dispute may concern

application or interpretation of EU law.!°

191. |The Respondent argues that the above-mentioned principles and conclusions should apply

to the disputes under the ECT involving interpretation or application of EU law.!*!

192. Second, the Respondent contends that the Achmea ruling refers to any “international
agreement”, including the ECT, and therefore it does not limit its effects to BITs. '52 Th this
regard, the Respondent submits that the grounds of the Achmea ruling are not formalistic
(i.e. based on the bilateral nature of the treaty at issue), but substantive because they refer

to the nature and characteristics of the arbitral jurisdiction faced with EU law.'*

193. Third, relying on the above observations, the Respondent concludes that the reasoning in
Achmea is applicable in the present case because the Tribunal may be called upon to
interpret and apply EU law given that “the core of the dispute affects [a] key institution of
EU Law, such as State Aid, which was created by EU Law to ensure the efficiency of the

internal market of the EU.”'™

194. Fourth, because the Tribunal does not form part of the EU judicial system and cannot
request a preliminary ruling to the CJEU under Article 267 of the TFEU, the Respondent

concludes that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the present dispute.!>°

195. In addition, the Respondent disputes the Claimants’ reliance on prior tribunals constituted
under the ECT which upheld their jurisdiction despite an intra-EU objection. For instance,
the Respondent argues that the Masdar v Spain award is inconsistent with paragraphs 31
to 57 of the Achmea ruling which refer to both bilateral and multilateral treaties; 156 and that

the reasoning in Vattenfall v Germany'>" was inadequate as the tribunal started its analysis

from flawed premises under international law and did not actually address the relevance

of Achmea.

Finally, with regard to the declarations made by EU Members States on 15 and
16 January 2019 regarding the Achmea ruling, the Respondent considers, inter alia, that
the declaration adopted by the majority of Member States “confirms that Article 26 of the
ECT cannot be considered a valid consent to arbitration in the case of intra-EU disputes

for it would be incompatible with the autonomy and primacy of EU law.”!*8

(2) The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that they meet the jurisdictional requirements of Article 26 of
the ECT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.'*? They request the Tribunal to dismiss
the Respondent’s “intra-EU” jurisdictional objection, which has been rejected by

numerous Tribunals. '°°

In their Memorial, the Claimants set forth the jurisdictional bases for their claims under the
ECT and the ICSID Convention. Concerning the ECT, the Claimants submit that:
(a) Spain is a “Contracting Party” to the ECT, as the ECT entered into force with respect
to Spain on 16 April 1998;!°! (b) each of the Claimants is an “investor of another
Contracting Party”, as they are companies incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg
(Hydro Energy) and Sweden (Hydroxana), States for which the ECT entered into force on
16 April 1998;!° (c) the dispute relates to an “investment” in the area of Spain, as the
Claimants hold shareholding and debt interests in Spanish companies that own and operate

hydropower generation installations, as well as interests in those installations, claims to

money, and rights conferred by law (including those conferred by RD 661);'® (d) the
Parties have consented to the arbitration of this dispute under the ECT, as Spain has given
its “unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration”
pursuant to Article 26(3) of the ECT and the Claimants have consented in writing to this
arbitration by filing their Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 26(4) of the ECT;'™
and (e) the Claimants sought to resolve the dispute by negotiation before commencing

arbitration, consistent with Article 26(1) of the ECT.!®

The Claimants further argue that the jurisdictional requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention have been met in this case, as they submit a legal dispute between a Contracting
State and nationals of other Contracting States arising out of their investments in the
hydropower generation sector in Spain, which they and Spain have consented in writing to

submit to the Centre.

In their Reply, the Claimants address the “intra-EU” objection raised by the Respondent in
its Counter-Memorial and request the Tribunal to find that it has jurisdiction ratione
personae under the ECT on the basis that: (i) the argument that the ECT is incompatible
with EU law is irrelevant because the Claimants do not base their claims on breaches of
EU law and, in any event, non-EU courts and tribunals are not precluded from applying or
interpreting EU law;'® (ii) nothing in the text, context or purpose of the ECT suggests the
exclusion of intra-EU disputes;'® and (iii) the commentators cited by the Respondent are

of no assistance to its position.'®

First, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s argument of incompatibility between
EU law and the ECT is misguided because it is based on the wrong assumption that the
Claimants’ claims are based on breaches of EU law.!”° The Claimants submit that their
claims in this case concern their rights under the ECT, not their rights in the EU’s Internal
Market in Electricity. The Tribunal is therefore not required to analyse the Claimants’
rights under the EU’s integral system and, accordingly, the matter does not hinder the

competence of the EU.!7!

The Claimants rely on the findings of prior tribunals to assert that, notwithstanding the
“intra-EU” nature of a dispute, tribunals constituted pursuant to the ECT or intra-EU BITs
have jurisdiction over investment-treaty claims because “such claims are not based on a

breach of EU Law but rather on a violation of the investment treaty in question.”!””

Hence,
the Claimants argue that the question of incompatibility of the ECT with EU law is not
relevant in this case because there is no such conflict presented. !7 In other words, “the

ECT (not EU law) is the applicable law to determining the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.” !”*

The Claimants further contend that the Respondent’s argument is irrelevant since the
application of EU law by an arbitral tribunal does not jeopardise the uniform application
of EU law. In this regard, the Claimants refer to the findings of a prior tribunal in support

that non-EU courts and tribunals are not precluded from applying or interpreting EU law.!7>

Second, the Claimants dismiss the Respondent’s interpretation of the ECT provisions and
submit that nothing in the text, context or purpose of the ECT suggests the exclusion of

intra-EU disputes. !7°

Regarding the text of the ECT, the Claimants argue that: (a) Article 1(3) of the ECT does
not imply any limitation on the consent to arbitration of Contracting Parties to the ECT
which belong to the same REIO;!”’ (6) Article 16 provides that the provisions of another
agreement cannot derogate from the provisions of the ECT where a provision of the ECT
is more favourable to the investor;'7* (c) Article 25 does not preclude REIO members to
agree to other obligations under a different treaty regime, in this case the ECT;'”? (d) the
voting provision under Article 36(7) has no bearing on Spain’s argument regarding an
alleged allocation of competences at the time of the ECT’s conclusion; '* and (e) Article 26

does not exclude intra-EU disputes.

With respect to Article 26, the Claimants argue that nothing in its text or context, nor in
the object of the ECT provides any basis for an exclusion of intra-EU ECT disputes.'*! For
instance, the Claimants contend that the ECT does not contain any disconnection clause in
respect of intra-EU disputes and if the ECT Contracting Parties wished to exclude intra-
EU disputes from the treaty’s scope, they would have included such clause. !** In addition,
the Claimants argue that the fact that the EU was an initial party to the ECT (together with
its Member States, including Spain) reinforces their argument as it implies that the EU and
its Member States, at the time of the ECT’s ratification, “had both the competence and the

intention to enter into and create obligations between themselves”. !**

The Claimants also dismiss the Respondent’s reliance on Article 344 of the TFEU. They
note that Article 344 of the TFEU concerns inter-State disputes concerning the
EU founding treaties (which are not at issue in this case), not disputes between a

Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party.'** In other words, “there

is no conflict between the ECT and EU law in this regard, because Articles 267 and 344

TFEU do not concern the same subject matter as Part III or Part V of the ECT”.!85

208. The Claimants also distinguish arbitral decisions relied on by the Respondent; for instance,
they state that the tribunal in Electrabel v Hungary concluded that there was “no material
inconsistency between the ECT and EU law” and that EU law was not an obstacle to its
jurisdiction.'*° Instead, they point to the decisions of other tribunals which have shared

the Claimants’ interpretation. '*’

209. Third, the Claimants submit that the commentators cited by the Respondent are of no

assistance to its position. !**

210. In their Rejoinder, the Claimants further claim that: (i) Spain’s reliance on the primacy of
EU law is misguided;'*? and (ii) the Claimants are not ‘dual’ corporate nationals nor

precluded from bringing a claim under Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. !°°

211. First, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s reference to the Costa v ENEL judgment
is inapposite because that case concerned a finding that a subsequent, unilateral measure
by an EU Member State could not conflict with existing EU relations. As such, that case
is irrelevant in this context because it concerned only the national law of a Member State

(not international treaties, such as the ECT), and because the ECT (unlike the measure at

issue in that case) is not a unilateral act but an international treaty.'?!

The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s argument that the ECT itself expressly
recognises the primacy of EU law in the context of intra-EU relations. In their view, this
argument is at odds with several provisions of the ECT, particularly Article 16(2).!°?
According to this provision, if a Contracting Party to the ECT has entered into an agreement
prior to the ECT concerning the same subject matter, the provisions of the prior agreement
cannot derogate from the provisions of the ECT where a provision of the ECT is more

favorable to the investor.'°>

Given that the EU treaties do not contain substantive or
procedural protections equivalent to Articles 10(1), 13 and 26 of the ECT, the provisions
of the ECT (which are more favorable to the investor in accordance with Article 16(2))

should prevail. !**

In addition, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s argument that EU law, not the
ECT, should apply because this dispute affects essential elements of EU law should be
rejected, inter alia, as the Claimants’ claims only concern their rights under the ECT and

not any issues of State aid.!°°

Moreover, the Claimants refer to the findings of the Eiser v Spain tribunal which dismissed
Spain’s argument that Article 26(6) of the ECT precludes the jurisdiction of an ECT
tribunal because it would imply introducing “a major, if unwritten, exception into the
coverage of the ECT on the back of a somewhat intricate argument regarding choice of
law” and disagreed “that the drafters of the ECT either intended or accomplished

this result”, !°°

Second, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that the Claimants are “dual”
corporate nationals of both their home EU Member States as well as of the EU, in

contravention of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.'”

The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s argument is wrong as a matter of fact because
the concept of “EU nationality” does not exist. While Article 20 of the TFEU establishes
citizenship of the EU, it does not establish EU nationality and instead acknowledges that
nationality and citizenship are different concepts. In fact, the EU is composed of citizens

who by definition do not share the same nationality. '°*

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s submission is also wrong as a matter of law
because the Claimants are not natural persons but companies, and as such they qualify as
“juridical persons” for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention which does

not contain any stipulation against dual corporate nationality.!”

In its post-hearing submissions, the Claimants submit that the Achmea ruling is not

applicable to the context of the ECT.?°

The Claimants argue that the Achmea ruling does not apply to the ECT.7°! The Claimants
dispute the Respondent’s reliance on the ruling for two main reasons: (i) the CJEU stated
in clear terms that its ruling in Achmea does not apply to the ECT, and Spain has
acknowledged this;?° and (ii) an ECT tribunal is obliged to uphold its “constitutional”

instrument, namely the ECT.23

220. First, the Claimants submit that prior to the Achmea ruling, the Respondent acknowledged
that such ruling would have no bearing on the present case under the ECT.2™' In addition,
the Claimants highlight that the Achmea case concerned a BIT dispute and the CJEU stated
expressly that the ruling had no bearing on a treaty such as the ECT.2 The Claimants cite

in this regard paragraphs 57 through 58 of the Achmea ruling which read:

It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an
international agreement providing for the establishment of a court
responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose
decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of
Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The
competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its
capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the
power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or
designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and
application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the
EU and its legal order is respected...

In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes
falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in
Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that
agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those
disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU
is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU
but by Member States.°°

221. The Claimants draw support for their argument from the award in Masdar v Spain, the first
investment treaty tribunal to decide on the implications of the Achmea ruling, and the
tribunal’s decision in the Vartenfall v Germany case.”°’ For instance, the Claimants state
that the tribunal in Masdar v Spain affirmed that the Achmea ruling cannot be applied to

multilateral treaties including the ECT and “pertains only to BITs concluded between

EU Member States”.?°* The Claimants agree with this reasoning and add that the tribunal
in that case noted that the wording of the question submitted to the CJEU for a preliminary
ruling specifically refers to “bilateral investment protection agreement between Member
States of the European Union”.

The Claimants further disagree with the Respondent’s argument that, prior to Achmea, the
incompatibility of arbitration provisions in multilateral agreements to which the EU is a
signatory with EU law had been already established.”!° In the Claimants’ view, the CJEU
took into account relevant and recent authorities in reaching its conclusions at

paragraphs 57 and 58 quoted above.”!!

Second, the Claimants maintain that in the event of contradiction between the ECT and
EU law, the Tribunal has to “uphold the application of its ‘constitutional’ instrument
— the ECT — on which its jurisdiction is founded”.”!?_ For the Claimants, this argument is
also supported by Article 16 of the ECT, which provides that the ECT prevails over any
other norm.”!> It is the Claimants’ submission, therefore, that EU law does not prevail over

the ECT nor can it trump public international law.?!4

Finally, with regard to the declarations made by EU Members States on 15 and 16 January
2019 regarding the Achmea ruling, the Claimants consider that the political nature of such
declarations “cannot have any /egal bearing on the ECT or in relation to arbitration being

heard thereunder”.?!>

For the reasons above, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear

this dispute.

B. Second Objection: Lack of Jurisdiction in View of the Taxation Carve-out in
Articles 21 and 10(7) of the ECT

(1) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims
relating to the alleged violation of the Respondent’s obligations under the ECT arising out

of measures introduced by Act 15/2012, namely the TVPEE and the Water Levy.?!®

In particular, the Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear: (i) breaches of
Article 10(1) of the ECT given the taxation carve-out in Article 21 of the ECT; and
(ii) breaches of other standards of protection (FET, MCPS, and non-impairment standards),
in view of the inapplicability of the MFN treatment standard of Article 10(7) of the ECT

that the Claimants seek to import to this case.7!”

a. Applicability of the taxation carve-out set out in Article 21 of the ECT
with regard to breaches concerning Article 10(1) of the ECT

The Respondent argues that: (a) Article 10(1) of the ECT does not generate obligations
regarding taxation measures in this case;7!* (b) the TVPEE and the Water Levy are taxation
measures for purposes of the ECT;7!° (c) it is not appropriate to conduct an additional
analysis on the good faith of the TVPEE and the Water Levy;?° and (d) even if such
additional analysis was undertaken, in any case the TVPEE and the Water Levy are bona

(fide taxation measures.”?!

First, the Respondent contends that it has not given consent to submit claims concerning
the TVPEE and the Water Levy to arbitration because: (a) Article 26 of the ECT only
concerns claims relating to breaches of obligations under Part III of the ECT; and
(b) pursuant to Article 21 of the ECT, Article 10 of the ECT does not generate any
obligations with respect to taxation measures of the Contracting Parties, although it is

located in Part III of the ECT.?” Article 21(1) of the ECT reads as follows:

Article 21. Taxation

1. Except _as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this
Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect_to
Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the
Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.?”

 

The Respondent explains that “if no obligation derived from Part III of the ECT exists,
there cannot be an alleged breach of it and thus, there is no consent of the Contracting Party
to resort to arbitration”.”“* The Respondent notes that although Article 21 of the ECT
contains a general exclusion of taxation measures from the scope of ECT’s application with
a few stipulated exceptions, none of those exceptions refers to Article 10(1) of the ECT.?7>
Accordingly, the Respondent argues, Article 10(1) of the ECT does not impose any

obligations with respect to taxation measures in this case.??°

Second, the Respondent argues that the TVPEE and the Water Levy are taxation measures
within the meaning of Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT, which includes “any provision relating
to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party”.??” The Respondent first contends

measures under either interpretation.?7°

Under domestic law, the Respondent notes that the Spanish Constitutional Court has
ratified the TVPEE as a tax.22? The Respondent also cites Article 1 of Act 15/2012, which
defines the TVPEE as a direct tax levied on the performance of the “activities of production
and incorporation into the electricity system of electric energy” in the Spanish electrical
system.*? The Respondent mentions that the TVPEE has a defined taxable base, a tax rate

and a tax period, and that its payment is made through a tax form.??!

The Respondent
further submits that the TVPEE is a deductible from corporate tax, which is confirmed by
the General Directorate of Taxation.?** With respect to the Water Levy, the Respondent
argues that Article 29 of Act 15/2012 confirms the taxation nature of the measure, as set
out in Article 2 of Act 58/2003 on General Taxation.”* The Respondent notes that the
Water Levy, as in the case of the TVPEE, has a defined taxable base, a taxable period and

a tax rate, that it is paid through a levy form, and it is a deductible from corporate tax.?*+

Under international law, the Respondent argues that the TVPEE and the Water Levy are
taxes according to the concept of tax adopted by prior arbitral tribunals.?*> Specifically,
the Respondent contends that the concept of tax developed by different tribunals has
defining characteristics, all of which are met with respect to both measures because: (a) the
measures are established by law (Act 15/2012); (b) the measures impose obligations on a
class of people (the TVPEE is applied to anyone that produces and incorporates electrical
energy into the Spanish electricity system, and the Water Levy is levied on water

concessionaires for the use and exploitation of continental waters for the production of

The Respondent further submits that, with respect to the TVPEE, the
European Commission has confirmed the taxation nature of the measure and its conformity

with EU law.?37

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that both the TVPEE and the Water Levy were
measures introduced by Act 15/2012, which is a part of the domestic law of Spain, a
Contracting Party to the ECT.?*8 The Respondent notes that Act 15/2012 was passed by

the Parliament in accordance with relevant legislative procedure and its Constitution.?°°

Third, the Respondent submits that, in determining whether the TVPEE and the Water
Levy are taxation measures, additional good faith or economic effects analysis is not
appropriate.”4° The Respondent argues that the Claimants’ reference to the Yukos v Russia
award is inapposite as the analysis used in that case is not applicable to this dispute.*“! The
Respondent also highlights that the tribunal in the case of EnCana v Ecuador found that
the question of whether something is a taxation measure is primarily a question of its “legal

operation, not its economic effect” .247

Finally, the Respondent contends that, in any event, the TVPEE and the Water Levy are

bona fide taxation measures.”

The Respondent submits that the TVPEE is a bona fide taxation measure on the basis that:
(a) it is not discriminatory in terms of its application and repercussion as it covers both

renewable and conventional energy producers, granting the same treatment to all

and (c) if conventional producers passed on the cost of the TVPEE to the market price of

increased market price.”°

The Respondent argues that the Water Levy is a bona fide taxation measure on the basis
that: (a) its establishment is a legitimate exercise of the State legislator without
discriminatory effect;?*” and (b) if hydroelectric power producers who are not part of the
special regime passed on the cost of the Water Levy to the market price of electricity, other
hydroelectric power producers would also benefit, as they would also obtain that increased

market price.7*

The Respondent further argues that both measures were adopted for the legitimate public
purpose of raising income for Spain. The Respondent also points out that the tribunals
in Isolux v Spain and Eiser v Spain upheld objections to jurisdiction over claims of alleged
breaches of Article 10(1) of the ECT with respect to the TVPEE. While the Respondent
acknowledges that the tribunals in these cases considered only the TVPEE, it argues that
the reasoning in these awards can be extended to the Water Levy because Claimants’

arguments are similar with respect to both measures.”

In light of the above, the Respondent concludes that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear
claims concerning the alleged violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT as a result of the

TVPEE and Water Levy enacted under Act 15/2012.?>!

b. Inapplicability of the MFN clause set out in Article 10(7) of the ECT,
in accordance with Article 21(3) of the ECT

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ subsidiary argument set out in their Reply that, if
the Tribunal considered that the TVPEE and the Water Levy are bona fide taxation
measures (thus excluded from protection under Article 10(1) of the ECT), the Claimants
may invoke breaches of substantive standards of protection contained in other international
treaties with regard to these measures, by means of the MEN clause set out in Article 10(7)

of the ECT.

The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ arguments should be dismissed because:
(a) the MEN clause set out in Article 10(7) of the ECT does not apply to taxes on income
or on capital, only to indirect taxes; (b) the disputed measures are direct taxes and therefore
fall outside the scope of the MFN clause; and (c) in any event, Article 21(3)(a) of the ECT

prohibits applying the MEN clause of Article 10(7) as the Claimants intend.?*

First, Article 10(7) of the ECT contains an MEN clause by which ECT Contracting Parties
shall accord to investments in their territories “treatment no less favourable than that which
it accords to Investments of its own Investors or of the Investors of any other Contracting
Party or any third state”. In turn, Article 21(3) of the ECT provides that Article 10(7)
“shall apply to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties other than those on income
or on capital”.”> The Respondent relies on a document from the ECT Secretariat to assert
that the exclusion of taxation measures on income or capital “remains, in general.

applicable with regard to indirect taxes”.*°° The Respondent therefore concludes that the

284 Energy Charter Treaty (CL-0036 and RL-0006), Article 10(7).

MEN clause in Article 10(7) may only apply to indirect taxes (i.e. those which can be

legally passed on to another person).?°”

Second, according to the Respondent, both the TVPEE and the Water Levy are direct taxes,
levied “on income or on capital” for the purposes of the ECT and therefore, Article 10(7)
is not applicable to these measures.*°* The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument
that the measures are not taxes on income because they are levied on gross income and not
on net income.” For the Respondent, a tax on income under the ECT does not require it
to be a tax on net income.” The Respondent argues that the Claimants have acknowledged
that the measures are taxes on income because, inter alia, they stated in their Reply that

the measures are levied on gross revenues.”°!

Finally, the Respondent contends that, in any case, Article 21(3)(a) of the ECT prevents

the application of the MFN clause as it provides that:

3. Article 10[7] ... shall not apply to:

a) Impose_most_favoured_ nation obligations with respect to

advantages accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the tax

provisions of any convention, agreement o arrangement described

in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii)[. 7°
The Respondent relies on Article 21(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT, which refers to “international
agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound”, and argue that the

BITs invoked by the Claimants are encompassed by this provision.?°

Therefore, the Respondent concludes that Article 10(7) of the ECT cannot be applied so as

to impose MEN obligations, as intended by the Claimants.”

(2) The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over breaches of the Respondent’s

obligations under the ECT arising out of the TVPEE and the Water Levy.?°

The Claimants request the Tribunal to dismiss the Respondent’s objection given that: (i) the
TVPEE and the Water Levy do not fall within the taxation carve-out at Article 21 of the

ECT because they are not bona fide taxation measures;7°

and (ii) alternatively, the
Claimants may invoke breaches of standards of protection (FET, MCPS, and the non-
impairment obligation) found in a number of BITs entered into by Spain with third

countries, in view of the MEN clause of Article 10(7) of the ECT.?97

a. Inapplicability of the taxation carve-out set out in Article 21 of the
ECT with regard to breaches concerning Article 10(1) of the ECT

There is no dispute between the Parties that the TVPEE and the Water Levy are taxes
imposed by Spanish domestic law and therefore constitute taxation measures as defined in
Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT.7° The Claimants argue, however, that (a) the taxation carve-
out set out in Article 21(1) of the ECT only applies to bona fide taxation measures;
(b) neither the TVPEE nor the Water Levy are bona fide taxation measures; and

(c) accordingly, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear claims concerning these measures.”

First, the Claimants submit that Article 21(1) of the ECT carves out only genuine bona
fide taxation measures from the scope of protection of Part III of the ECT. They refer in

this regard to the definition of bona fide taxes found in the Yukos v Russia award (i.e. “those

‘that are motivated by the purpose of raising general revenue for the State’”), which
excludes actions carried out under the guise of taxation that in reality aim to achieve an

unrelated purpose.?””

The Claimants dismiss the Respondent’s criticisms to the Yukos v Russia award and note
that the key finding of that tribunal, which is fully applicable in this case, is that the ECT’s

taxation carve-out can only apply to bona fide measures.>”!

Second, the Claimants maintain that the TVPEE and the Water Levy are not bona fide
taxes for the purpose of Article 21 of the ECT, but “disguised, discriminatory tariff cuts,

introduced for the specific purpose of addressing Spain’s self-inflicted tariff deficit”.”””

Among other arguments, the Claimants contend that the TVPEE and the Water Levy are
not bona fide taxation measures because they: (a) did not tax the value of electricity as
purported, but instead reduced the value of the feed-in remuneration granted to the
Claimants in a manner that was not tied to income, operating costs or profitability;?”
(b) had a disproportionate and discriminatory impact on different electricity producers
(i.e. renewable energy producers and conventional power producers) and therefore they
were not taxes of general application;”” (c) did not raise any general revenue for the State
(as the amounts collected must be used to finance the costs of the electricity system);?”>
and (d) did not serve the purported purpose of raising general revenues for the State nor

. . wo 2
did they serve any environmental aim.?”°

Concerning the TVPEE, the Claimants further argue that: (a) before the New Regime
applied, the effect of this measure on the Claimants’ hydro installations was discriminatory

because the installations only received the RD 661/2007 regulated tariff (i.e. a fixed

payment per k Wh, detached from the market price) and after the New Regime generators
may not be able to recover the 7% levy if their production is below the standard operating
hours set by the Respondent;?”’ (b) the Respondent’s reference to a judgment of its
Constitutional Court upholding the taxation nature of the TVPEE is irrelevant as the
question before the Tribunal is not whether the TVPEE was contrary to Spanish law but
whether it is a bona fide taxation measure under international law;?’* (c) by passing on to
producers costs over which they have no control (i.e. electricity generation), the TVPEE
fails to comply with its alleged environmental purpose;?”? and (d) the Respondent’s
reliance on the findings of the /solux v Spain and the Eiser v Spain tribunals do not assist
its position because in Jsolux v Spain the tribunal agreed that only bona fide taxation
measures can benefit from the tax carve-out in Article 21(1) of the ECT, and in Eiser v
Spain the claimants accepted and the tribunal thus assumed without analysis that the

TVPEE had all the characteristics of a legitimate tax.?°°

With regard to the Water Levy, the Claimants further argue that: (a) it did not raise general
revenue for the State because, unlike all other fees collected under the Water Law
concerning the use of public waters, only 2% of the revenue collected by the Water Levy
is remitted to the relevant “Watershed agency” while the remaining 98% is allocated to
cover the costs of the Spanish electricity system;7*! and (b) the Respondent’s argument that
the pass-through of the Water Levy to the market price by big hydro-producers will also
benefit the Claimants’ hydro installations is misguided because before the New Regime
entered into force the Claimants’ facilities only received the RD 661/2007 regulated tariff
which was detached from the market price, and after the New Regime entered into force
the Water Levy can only be passed on to consumers by a small subsector of renewable

producers with a limited impact on the market price.?*?

Moreover, according to the Claimants, the Respondent’s reliance on domesic and
international law to categorize the TVPEE and the Water Levy as taxation measures is not
sufficient.?? The Claimants argue that: (a) investment treaty tribunals have confirmed that
domestic law is not determinative in classifying a purported taxation measure; and (b) the
defining characteristics of a tax under international law suggested by the Respondent are
inadequate because they ignore the bona fide criterion established by the Yukos v Russia
tribunal and in any case the measures fail to serve a legitimate “public purpose”, and thus

they do not meet the test proposed by the Respondent.?**

Third, in view of the above, the Claimants conclude that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to
hear breaches of the Respondent’s obligations under the ECT concerning the TVPEE and
the Water Levy.

b. Applicability of the MFN clause set out in Article 10(7) of the ECT, in
accordance with Article 21(3) of the ECT

The Claimants submit that, if the TVPEE and the Water Levy were considered bona fide
taxes for the purposes of Article 21 of the ECT, (a) they should be considered as taxes
“other than those on income or on capital” within the meaning of Article 21(3) of the ECT;
and accordingly (b) the Respondent must comply with its MFN obligation set forth in
Article 10(7) of the ECT.78>

First, the Claimants note that Article 21(3) of the ECT introduces an exception to the tax
carve-out at Article 21(1) of the ECT for taxes other than those on income or capital.?°°
Article 21(7)(b) of the ECT, in turn, defines taxes on income and capital as those “imposed

on total income, on total capital or on elements of income or of capital”.78”

In support of their argument that the measures are not a tax on income or capital, the
Claimants note that: (a) the TVPEE and the Water Levy are imposed on gross revenues;7**
and (b) the ordinary meaning of the term “taxes on income” refers to taxes on net income
(not on gross revenues).”*? The Claimants argue that the definition of “taxes on income”
in the OECD Model Tax Convention, which mirrors the definition under the Article
21(7)(b) of the ECT, does not include charges on “gross revenues”.”? According to the
Claimants, their argument is also confirmed by Article 2 of the OECD Model Tax
Convention and commentators’ interpretations which refer to net amounts, not

2
gross amounts.7?!

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that to benefit from the exception at
Article 21(3) of the ECT, a taxation measure must not only be a tax “other than those on
income and capital” but must also be an “indirect” tax. The Claimants maintain that the
only criterion for the application of Article 21(3) of the ECT is that the taxes are not “on

income and capital”.?°*

Among other arguments, the Claimants submit that there is no
textual basis for the Respondent’s assertion as Article 21(7)(b) of the ECT says nothing
about indirect taxes.?°? Also, they argue that the Respondent misquoted the excerpt from
the ECT Secretariat on which it allegedly bases its position.?°* Therefore, whether the

TVPEE and the Water Levy are direct or indirect taxes is irrelevant.?°>

Contrary to the Respondent’s submission, the Claimants highlight that there is nothing
contradictory in their submissions as they have “nowhere characterized either the TVPEE

or Water Levy as direct or indirect taxes”.”°° The Claimants refer to specific passages of

their prior pleadings and contend that the Respondent has partially quoted them to

: : we
misrepresent their position.?%”

Second, the Claimants argue that, because the TVPEE and the Water Levy are taxes “other
than those on income and capital”, the Respondent is obliged under Article 10(7) of the
ECT to accord the Claimants the same treatment with respect to these measures as it

accords to other foreign investors under relevant BITs.?°*

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that, because Article 21(7)(a)(ii) of the
ECT -concerning the definition of the term “Taxation Measure” for the purpose of
Article 21— refers to “any provision relating to taxes ... of any other international
agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is bound”, then the BITs entered
into by Spain from which the Claimants seek to import other investment protections are
international agreements by which Spain is bound, and the FET, MCPS and non-

impairment obligations of those BITs are “tax provisions”.?°?

The Claimants argue that the FET, MCPS and non-impairment provisions invoked do not
relate to taxes and it would be untenable to consider them as “taxation measures” for the
purposes of the ECT. These provisions concern substantive standards of treatment that the
Respondent must afford, as host State, to investments by investors of the home State, under
the relevant BITs. In the Claimants’ view, the fact that in certain circumstances these
provisions may be applied in respect of taxation measures adopted by the host State “cannot
transform them into provisions that relate to taxes. To put it another way, the use to which

the provisions may be put cannot define their nature”.*°°

Lastly, the Claimants maintain that, in any event, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide on
the Claimants’ claim that the TVPEE and the Water Levy form part of a series of measures

constituting a creeping expropriation of their investments in breach of Article 13 of the

ECT. This is so because Article 21(5)(a) of the ECT provides that Article 13 on
expropriation shall apply to taxes, and Spain explicitly states that it does not assert a

jurisdictional objection against this claim.*”!

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS ON LIABILITY

The Claimants submit that the Respondent has breached its obligations under the

Articles 13 and 10(1) of the ECT, based on four main claims.

First, the Claimants claim that the Respondent violated Article 13 of the ECT by subjecting
the Claimants’ investments to measures having an effect that is equivalent to
expropriation.** The Claimants further allege that these measures did not abide by the
ECT requirements of lawful expropriation.*? The Respondent maintains that the
Claimants’ investments have not been expropriated and that the challenged measures are

regulatory acts that do not generate an obligation to compensate.***

Second, the Claimants assert that the Respondent breached the FET standard under
Article 10(1) of the ECT. Specifically, the Claimants argue that the Respondent frustrated
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations; failed to provide a stable legal and business
framework for the Claimants’ investments; failed to act in a transparent manner and respect
the Claimants’ due process rights; and acted in a manner that was arbitrary, unreasonable,
disproportionate, and discriminatory.*°> The Respondent claims that it did not violate the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations; provided a stable legal and business framework for the
Claimants’ investments; acted in a transparent manner without infringing upon the
Claimants’ due process rights; and that the measures adopted were reasonable,

proportionate, and non-discriminatory.*°°

Third, the Claimants argue that the Respondent has impaired, by unreasonable and
discriminatory measures, the management, use and enjoyment of the Claimants’
investments in violation of Article 10(1) of the ECT.**’ The Respondent claims that the
measures were reasonable and non-discriminatory, ensuring a “reasonable rate of return”

for the Claimants’ investments.*°

Finally, the Claimants submit that the Respondent breached the standard of MCPS as a
result of dismantling the legal framework on which the Claimants’ investments relied.*°
The Respondent argues that the measures at issue were reasonable and in accordance with
the given circumstances, and therefore, it has provided full protection and security to the

Claimants’ investments.?!°

A. Alleged Unlawful Expropriation in Breach of Article 13 of the ECT
(1) Introduction

The Claimants assert that the Respondent indirectly expropriated the value of Claimants’
equity and debt investments through measures that did not meet the requirements provided

under Article 13(1) of the ECT.*!!

The Respondent argues that it has not expropriated the Claimants’ investments either
directly or indirectly.*!? The Respondent also asserts that the disputed measures are
regulatory acts that do not generate the obligation to compensate because they were

reasonable and proportional.*!*

(2) The Applicable Legal Standard

The text of Article 13 of the ECT is as follows:

ARTICLE 13
EXPROPRIATION

(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of
any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized,
expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect
equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter
referred to as “Expropriation”) except where such
Expropriation is:

(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;

(b) not discriminatory;

(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and
effective compensation. ...7!4

a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that the protection in Article 13(1) of the ECT extends to indirect
expropriation, which results from “measures having effect equivalent to

expropriation”.*!5. The Claimants state that indirect expropriation may take the form of
“creeping expropriation”, that is “a series of acts and/or omissions over time that
cumulatively result in expropriation even if each individual measure would not constitute

an expropriation standing alone”.*!®

The Claimants argue that the “equivalent effect” or “actual effect” of the measures on the
investments is the touchstone in all cases of indirect expropriation, not whether the State

intended an expropriation.*!”

The Claimants submit that an essential factor for finding that an expropriation has occurred
is whether there has been a substantial deprivation of the value or economic benefits of the
investment, “irrespective of whether ownership, control or management rights are also

directly affected”.*!*

The Claimants further rely on arbitral precedents to assert that States may carry out indirect

expropriations through regulatory measures.°!?

In addition, the Claimants argue that a State has an obligation to compensate investors for
the destruction of their investments in case of expropriation, irrespective of whether such
destruction was due to the State’s bona fide exercise of its police powers.*”° In any event,
the purpose of a State measure does not affect the State’s obligation to compensate the

expropriated investor.*?!

With respect to the lawfulness of an expropriation, the Claimants assert that failure to
comply with any of the subparagraphs (a) through (d) of Article 13 of the ECT entails a

breach of the provision.*??

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent asserts that the definition of expropriation requires the existence of an
“asset”.°?3. The Respondent further argues that this definition requires the Claimants to
prove that it has ownership over the allegedly expropriated asset and that there is a causal

relationship between the measures and their effect on the ownership of said asset.*?*

Regarding indirect expropriation, the Respondent refers to the findings of prior arbitral
tribunals to assert that, for governmental measures to be equivalent to expropriation, such
measures must prevent the investor from continuing to operate its investment or from using
it, or otherwise entail a substantial, radical, severe and devastating deprivation of

the investment.>?°

Concerning the lawfulness of an expropriation, the Respondent argues that tribunals have
considered whether the contested measures are reasonable or in proportion with the

intended objective or public interest sought.”

(3) The Claim
a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that the Respondent breached its obligation under the ECT by
subjecting the Claimants’ investments to measures having effect equivalent to
expropriation, and that such measures were unlawful.*?’ Each of these main arguments is

summarized below.

(i) Indirect Expropriation

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s measures had an effect that was “equivalent to
expropriation” on their investments. The Claimants assert that Spain substantially deprived
them of the value and economic benefits of their equity and debt investments through a
series of wrongful measures, thus resulting in an indirect, creeping expropriation.*”*> The

Claimants submit three main arguments in this regard.

First, the Claimants state that their investments in Spain are protected investments within
the meaning of the ECT and capable of being expropriated. The Claimants argue that the
Respondent miscategorised the Claimants’ future lost income as the Claimants’
investment.*?? The Claimants emphasize that their investments are the equity and debt
interests in Spanish companies, and consequently, such shareholding and debt investments

are protected “investments” under Article 1(6) the ECT.*”°

The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s reliance in the case Nations Energy v Panama,
which the Respondent cited to argue that measures that only apply to the future without
affecting any acquired rights cannot amount to expropriation.**! The Claimants emphasize
that the facts in the present case are different.*** Specifically, the Claimants argue that in
this case the Respondent conferred vested rights to the Claimants by providing express
guarantees that the feed-in remuneration regime would last for “the full operating lifetime
of qualifying facilities” and that any adverse future changes would not apply to installations

already in existence.**

Second, the Claimants dispute the Respondent’s justification that the challenged measures
are regulatory acts not subject to compensation. The Claimants submit that the nature and
purpose of the Respondent’s measures are relevant to their legality (per the wording of
Article 13(1) of the ECT), but do not affect their characterisation as expropriation or excuse
compensation.*** The Claimants further argue that, in any event, the Respondent has not
shown that the measures were taken for a bona fide public purpose nor that the regulations

were reasonable or proportional.**°

Finally, the Claimants contend that the Respondent’s measures deprived the value and
economic benefits of their investments in a manner that is equivalent to expropriation.>*°
The Claimants mention that the market prices in the small-hydro sector are insufficient to
service the installations’ project financing debt obligations and to generate a return on the
Claimants’ equity and debt investments. Therefore, “[t]he economic benefits of these
investments have ... disappeared, and those investments have thus been rendered

essentially worthless”.**7

As evidence of the deprivation of value and benefit on their investments, the Claimants
mention, inter alia, that the measures have reduced the fair market value of their equity
investments from EUR 130.2 million (in the but-for scenario) to EUR 19 million (in the
actual scenario), and the value of their debt investments from EUR 9.4 million (in the but-

for scenario) to EUR 1.8 million (in the actual scenario).***

(ii) Unlawfulness of the Measures

The Claimants argue that the Respondent violated each of the four cumulative requirements

for a lawful expropriation under Article 13 of the ECT.*

The Claimants first claim that the measures at issue did not serve any legitimate public
purpose. Among other arguments, the Claimants submit that: the tariff deficit that Spain
allegedly aimed at reducing was a consequence of its own actions; there is no reasonable
or proportional relationship between the State measures concerning the small-hydro sector
and Spain’s aim of reducing the tariff deficit given that the feed-in remuneration to small-
hydro contributed the lowest amount towards the electricity system’s regulated costs; Spain
failed to adopt other less restrictive means to fulfil its stated objective of reducing the tariff

deficit; and, in any event, a State has no right to expropriate only for financial purposes.*#°

294. The Claimants then submit that the measures at issue were also discriminatory;*! not
carried out under due process of law;*? and not accompanied by any prompt, adequate and
effective compensation (instead, the regulatory changes “were purposefully designed to
create the appearance of providing a ‘reasonable return’ and thus deny the existence of a

damage or the need to compensate the Claimants”).*#7

295. Based on the above, the Claimants conclude that the Respondent has unlawfully

expropriated their investment, and therefore, breached Article 13 of the ECT.*4

b. The Respondent’s Position

296. The Respondent submits that there has been neither direct nor indirect expropriation.*4>
The Respondent further claims that the measures cannot be considered expropriatory as

they are reasonable and lawful.*#° Each of these arguments is summarized below.

(i) Lack of Direct or Indirect Expropriation

297. The Respondent first considers that future returns, or loss of future income or revenues, are
not an asset subject to expropriation under the ECT, Spanish law or otherwise under
international law.*4” In particular, the Respondent notes that both Spanish law and
international law require the rights to be vested or acquired in order for their deprivation to
be compensable.*#® The Respondent contends that the facts of this case only establish the
Claimants’ acquired right to the remuneration under RD 661/2007 with respect to the

energy already sold, but not to future returns.*? The Respondent, citing Nations Energy v

Panama as an illustrative case, further argues that measures that do not affect acquired
rights (as in this case, which concerns future returns) cannot be considered equivalent

to expropriation.*°°

Furthermore, the Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal is required to refer to domestic
legislation, in this case Spanish law, in determining which rights are subject to
expropriation.*>!_ The Respondent claims that based on Royal Legislative Decree 1/2010
concerning Spanish corporations law, and Supreme Court case law, the Claimants’
ownership of shares grant them, at most, the expectation to receive dividends and to
oversee the management of the administrative body, but under no circumstance a right to
receive dividends nor a right to the direct management of the plants in which they

hold shares.*°

Therefore, the Respondent concludes that the Claimants’ investment is not an asset subject
to expropriation since the shares and subordinated debt held in the Xana Plants and in the
Ondina Plants do not imply the right to manage such companies or the right to receive

dividends, as protected under Article 13(1) of the ECT.*?

The Respondent further contends that the challenged measures do not constitute an indirect
expropriation because: (a) the Claimants continue to control their shares in the plants;
(b) the plants continue to operate; and (c) the Claimants continue to obtain a reasonable

rate of return from the plants.***

In short, the Respondent argues that neither the
Respondent has prevented the Claimants from continuing with the operations of their
plants, nor the effects of the challenged measures on the Claimants’ investments meet the

required threshold for “substantial deprivation” to be considered expropriatory.>*>

(ii) Lawfulness of the Measures

The Respondent claims that the measures adopted are “non-discriminatory regulatory
adaptations that were enacted in good faith for the purpose of protecting public interest in
a proportionate manner to the objective they were intended to achieve and in compliance

with due process”.**°

Accordingly, the Respondent asserts that the challenged measures are regulatory acts that
do not generate the obligation to compensate.**” Specifically, the Respondent argues that
the challenged measures consist of macroeconomic control measures which were adopted

to serve a public purpose, including resolving the tariff deficit.*>*

Furthermore, the
Respondent argues that the measures were reasonable as the Claimants can recover the
costs associated with their investments as well as a “reasonable rate of return”.*°? The
Respondent also argues that the measures were applied to all operators in the Spanish

energy system, and therefore, they are not discriminatory.*

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent maintains that the Claimants failed to meet their burden
of proof in showing that the measures at issue were not in the public interest.*°!
The Respondent argues that the disputed measures have been accepted as necessary and
reasonable macroeconomic control measures, and consequently, admissible as a public

interest policy.*°? The admissibility of reforms arising from a rational policy, the

Respondent argues, has been supported by several prior tribunals.**

Moreover, the Respondent reiterates that the disputed measures are proportionate,

compliant with due process requirements (e.g. without any irregularities in the legislative
process),*® and highlight that the competent Spanish tax authorities have confirmed that

the TVPEE and the Water Levy do not amount to an expropriation.*°°

Based on the above, the Respondent concludes that it has not unlawfully expropriated the

Claimants’ investment, and therefore, has not breached Article 13 of the ECT.*”

B. Alleged Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Obligation of Article 10(1)
of the ECT

(1) Introduction

The Claimants submit that the measures at issue violate the Respondent’s obligations under
the FET standard of the ECT. As part of their analysis, the Claimants argue that the
Respondent’s treatment of the Claimants’ investments: (a) failed to provide stability to the
Claimants’ investments; (b) failed to protect the Claimants’ legitimate expectations;
(c) was not transparent and failed to respect the Claimants’ due process rights; and (d) was

unreasonable, disproportionate, arbitrary, and discriminatory.*°*

The Respondent argues that it has complied with the FET standard of the ECT.
Specifically, the Respondent submits that: (a) it respected its duty to provide stable and
transparent conditions; *° (b) it did not violate the Claimants’ expectations; (c) the
measures were carried out in a transparent manner and following due process; and (d) its
treatment of the Claimants’ investments was reasonable, proportional, non-arbitrary, and

non-discriminatory.*”°

(2) The Applicable Legal Standard

308. Article 10(1) of the ECT requires Contracting Parties to “encourage and create stable,
equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors[, including] a commitment
to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and
equitable treatment”.*7!

309. Both Parties agree that the FET standard must be considered in the light of the object and
purpose of the ECT.*” The Parties also agree that the FET standard of the ECT includes

the duty to provide stable conditions for foreign investors,*”*

374

to refrain from acting in a

disproportionate manner,””” to respect investors’ legitimate expectations at the time of their

investment,*”> to act transparently and in accordance with due process,°”° and to refrain

from acting unreasonably or discriminatorily.*”

a. The Claimants’ Position

310. The Claimants agree with the Respondent that the protection standards of the ECT,
including FET, must be analysed in accordance with the objective of the ECT. However,
they reject the Respondent’s argument that the ECT’s objective is to ensure national

treatment or non-discrimination.*”* Instead, the Claimants maintain that:

the fundamental objectives of the ECT are to require the Contracting
States to maintain a stable and transparent legal and regulatory
framework for energy sector investments, and to provide substantive
protections (which include, but are not limited to, national
treatment) and the procedural mechanism of investor-State dispute
settlement, with a view to reducing political and regulatory risks and
thus facilitate investments in the energy sector.*””

The Claimants argue that FET is an autonomous legal standard of protection, which is
higher than the customary international law minimum standard for the treatment of

aliens.°°°

The Claimants submit that under the ECT, the Respondent has an obligation: (a) to respect
investors’ legitimate expectations and to provide a stable legal and business framework for
their investments; (b) to act in a transparent manner and in accordance with due process;
and (c) to refrain from acting disproportionately, arbitrarily, unreasonably or

discriminatorily.**!

First, the Claimants argue that the provision of a stable legal and business environment is
encompassed in the protection of investors’ legitimate and reasonable expectations, such
protection being a core element of the FET standard.**? The Claimants note that this is of
particular importance in the energy sector because of the heavy reliance investors have on
a stable legal and business environment when committing a substantial amount of capital
for generating long-term returns.**? The Claimants further argue that this reliance can be

derived from laws and regulations, as well as other indirect undertakings of a host State.***

Second, the Claimants note that the FET standard requires a State to act in a manner that
is transparent and in accordance with investors’ due process rights.*** The Claimants
submit that transparency requires the absence of administrative ambiguity or opacity,
which is closely related to respecting “procedural propriety and due process”.**° The
Claimants also highlight the investors’ right to receive information and be heard on

important decisions, in a fair and prior hearing.**”

Third, the Claimants argue that the FET standard encompasses a protection against

disproportionate, arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures.***

Concerning the proportionality principle, the Claimants argue that it applies equally to
administrative acts and to the enactment of legislation.**” The Claimants refer to a four-
stage test adopted by the Occidental v Ecuador tribunal for assessing the proportionality

of a State measure, as follows:

(a) the legitimacy of the State’s aim; (b) whether the measure
adopted by the State was suitable and/or reasonably connected to the
objective it pursued; (c) whether the measure adopted by the State
was necessary (i.e., was it the least restrictive measure available to
achieve the State’s aim); and (d) whether the effects of the measure
were disproportionate or excessive in relation to the interests
involved, i.e., whether the benefit of realising the State’s aim
exceeded the harm to the relevant rights of investors.*”°
The Claimants add that these four elements are cumulative and the State’s failure to comply

with any of them will result in breach of the FET standard.*?!

To determine whether measures are arbitrary, the Claimants refer to a fourfold
classification developed by Professor Schreuer, on whether the measures at issue: (a) inflict
damage upon investors without serving any apparent legitimate purpose; (b) are based on
“discretion, prejudice or personal preference” instead of acceptable legal standards; (c) are
adopted for reasons other than those put forward by the State; and (d) are taken in wilful
disregard of due process and proper procedure.*” In their Reply, the Claimants dismiss the

Respondent’s assertion that protection against arbitrariness is not a part of the FET standard

and submit there is a “well-settled jurisprudence finding States to be in breach of the FET

standard where they act in an arbitrary manner”.*”°

In determining the reasonableness of the measures at issue, the Claimants submit that it
must be shown that the measures were taken in pursuance of a rational policy goal and

were tailored to achieve that goal.***

Finally, the Claimants consider that unjustifiable or arbitrary regulatory distinctions made
without justification between things that are alike (e.g. between similarly situated groups

of people or categories), may amount to discriminatory treatment proscribed by the ECT.**

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent considers that the protection standards of the ECT, including FET, must
be analysed in accordance with the objective of the ECT, which is to ensure the principle
of national treatment or non-discrimination.°”° In this regard, the ECT does not limit nor
prevents the adoption of macroeconomic control measures on grounds of general
interest.**” In its Rejoinder, the Respondent also maintains that a number of precedents
have allowed reasonable and proportionate regulatory changes on the grounds of public
policy.*°* Accordingly, the protection afforded to investors under the FET standard is not
absolute, nor can it amount to an “insurance policy” in favour of the investor in a strategic

and highly regulated sector such as the energy sector.*””

The Respondent agrees with the Claimants that in examining the FET standard, tribunals
must assess the legitimate expectations that an investor had at the time of its investment.*°

The Respondent maintains that the standard of providing stable conditions under the ECT

does not extend to providing a “predictable” regulatory framework, since the wording of
Article 10(1) of the ECT does not contain such term. Moreover, the Respondent argues
that the ECT does not guarantee the predictability of the regulatory framework of the

Contracting States unless there is a specific commitment by the State in this regard.4°!

The Respondent submits that investors’ expectations must be reasonable and objective in
relation to the existing regulatory framework, and therefore, tribunals must assess whether
investors knew and understood the framework applicable to their investments, as well as

the risk associated with it.4

With respect to the duty to provide stable conditions, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’
interpretation of “retroactivity”, and submits that retroactive measures must affect acquired

rights in accordance with international and national precedents.*°

Regarding the interpretation of the principle of transparency under the ECT, the
Respondent refers to the tribunals’ decisions in the cases of Tecmed v Mexico, Electrabel
v Hungary, and Plama v Bulgaria.*°+ Concerning due process, the Respondent refers to

the interpretation of this concept by a number of arbitral tribunals.*°

In assessing compliance with the FET standard, the Respondent notes that the prohibition
of arbitrary measures is not an independent standard but is encompassed within the ECT
protection against impairment of investments by unreasonable or discriminatory

measures.*°° The Respondent submits that an analysis of whether the measures in dispute

(3) The Claim
a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s treatment of their investments is in breach of
the FET standard because the Respondent: (i) failed to provide a stable legal and business
framework for their investment; (ii) frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations;
(iii) failed to act in a transparent manner and to respect the Claimants’ due process rights;
and (iv) acted in a manner that was arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate,

and discriminatory.

(i) Respondent Failed to Provide a Stable Legal and Business Framework

for Claimants’ Investments
The Claimants maintain that the Respondent failed to provide a stable legal and economic
framework for their investments because it overhauled the RD 661/2007 feed-in
remuneration regime that was in place at the time of their investments, thus dismantling
the legal framework upon which Claimants’ investments were premised.*°* The Claimants
refer, inter alia, to the tribunal’s decision in Eiser v Spain to illustrate that the drastic and

abrupt change to the RD 661/2007 regime amounts to a violation of the FET standard.*°°

In particular, the Claimants identify six main changes between the RD 661/2007 feed-in
remuneration regime and the New Regime through which the value of their investments

was allegedly eviscerated.*!”

First, the RD 661/2007 regime was based on maximization of production while the New

Regime establishes a completely new remuneration framework applicable to existing

installations that is not production-oriented.*!! For instance, through the enactment of
RD-2/2013 the Respondent eliminated the premium under the “pool price plus premium”
option that was afforded by RD 661/2007 and replaced the Consumer Price Index (“CPI’”)-
linked updating index in RD 661/2007 with a lower index, resulting in lower

revenue growth.*!?

Second, the RD 661/2007 regime was not subject to any cap on renewable installations’
feed-in remuneration or investors’ level of profitability (by reference to an alleged principle
of “reasonable rate of return” or otherwise) while the New Regime subjects existing
installations to a cap by reference to a “target rate of return” on assumed costs.*!> The
Claimants argue, inter alia, that the “target rate of return” is retroactive and backward

looking in the calculation of the return.*!*

Third, the RD 661/2007 regime entitled the Claimants’ hydropower installations to feed-
in remuneration for their entire operational lifetimes while the New Regime limits payment
of the new feed-in incentive to 25 years from the deemed dates of installations’
commissioning without regard to their actual remaining useful life.*!> The Claimants note
that this 25-year period has either already expired or will come to an end shortly for most

of the Claimants’ plants.*!°

Fourth, the RD 661/2007 regime was based on kWh of electricity produced by each
individual plant and thus driven by actual plant-specific variables as determined by the
investor, while the New Regime sets arbitrary and unreasonable new remuneration
parameters derived from hypothetical standard installations as set by Spain.*!” This change

drastically reduced the level of feed-in remuneration enjoyed by existing

installations.*'® As a result of the Respondent’s measures, the Claimants submit that their

plants are now only entitled to market price for their electricity.“!

Fifth, the RD 661/2007 regime contained express commitments that adverse future
changes to the statutorily applicable feed-in remuneration would not affect existing
installations, while the New Regime enables Spain to unilaterally vary the ex-post target
return and update the new remuneration parameters for both existing and new installations

in regulatory periods with limited scrutiny.*”°

Finally, the RD 661/2007 regime was based on, and driven by, Spain’s desire to increase
its installed capacity base for different technologies to meet its renewable energy targets
by assigning specific Government targets to each technology, while the New Regime

abandons these targets and seeks to reduce the remuneration to renewables.*?!

(ii) Respondent Frustrated Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations

The Claimants argue that the Respondent made a number of representations to foreign
investors with the specific aim of inducing investment in the small-hydro sector.*?* In
particular, the Claimants submit that, at the time of their investments, they had legitimate
expectations that: the small-hydro plants they had acquired would be entitled to benefit
from the RD 661/2007 feed-in remuneration regime during their entire operational lives in
amounts pre-established in RD 661/2007, that any changes to that remuneration regime
would be unlikely and that, in any event, such changes would not adversely impact existing
small-hydro facilities nor would they fundamentally alter the essential characteristics of

the regulatory framework on the basis of which they invested.”

The Claimants claim that their expectations were legitimate based on the express
guarantees set out in RD 661/2007 and representations attributable to the Respondent
(e.g. through a press release issued by the Ministry of Energy, a statement issued by the
Council of Ministers, and presentations for investors given by personnel of the CNE and
InvestinSpain), which induced the Claimants’ investment by guaranteeing that facilities
registered by the legal deadline would not be subject to retroactive changes to the feed-in
tariff.*** In this case, all 33 of the hydropower plants in which the Claimants invested were
registered before the legal deadline and hence were eligible for and relied upon the

guaranteed feed-in tariff (“Fil”) under RD 661/2007.*75

The Claimants also submit that their expectations were legitimate, as they were the result
of the Claimants’ due diligence prior to making their investment.*”° The results of the due
diligence showed, inter alia, the following: (a) that for over 30 years the Respondent had
consistently updated and improved the regulatory regime of the small-hydro sector without
adverse, retroactive regulatory changes; (b) that small-hydro was the safest and most
“bankable” from among other renewable energy sectors in Spain (e.g. due to its negligible
contribution to the regulated costs of the Spanish electricity system and since several small-
hydro assets in Spain were owned by semi-public entities and large Spanish utilities);
(c) IDAE was looking to expand its portfolio of small-hydro assets; (d) according to IDAE
representatives, the small-hydro sector was sheltered from any future adverse regulatory
changes; (e) major utilities and foreign infrastructure funds had demonstrated
acquisitiveness in the Spanish small-hydro sector; and (f) lenders continued to fund small-

hydro projects.?”

The Claimants, relying on Masdar v Spain, dismiss the Respondent’s allegation that there
was any Supreme Court case law that could have constituted a warning to the Claimants of

the possibility of regulatory changes.*” The Claimants submit that (a) the first group of

case law upon which the Respondent relies did not concern the regime established under
RD 661/2007;*” (b) the second group of case law from December 2009 do not support the
Respondent’s contention that the government had unlimited authority to make sweeping
changes to the regulatory framework for the small-hydro sector;**° and (c) the third group
of case law are post-investment judgments that could not have put the Claimants on notice
— at the time of their investment — about Spain’s upcoming regulatory changes, nor could

they have an effect on the legitimacy of their expectations.**!

The Claimants submit that, because Spain is unable to engage with this record, the
Respondent has mischaracterized the regulatory regime applicable at the time of the

Claimants’ investments.**

The Claimants argue that, contrary to the Respondent’s
assertions: (a) renewable electricity generation was not a regulated activity under the
Electricity Act 54/1997;4 (b) there was no overriding principle of “economic
sustainability” or “financial self-sufficiency” within Spanish regulation at the time of the
Claimants’ investments;*** (¢) Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 contained an unambiguous
and unequivocal guarantee of non-retroactivity to specific facilities —i.e. those that were

435

commissioned by a particular date;**” and (d) under the regulatory regime existing at the

time of the Claimants’ investments, brownfield projects had the same rights and received

the same feed-in remuneration as greenfield projects.+*°

In response to the Respondent’s contention that the Claimants were or should have been
aware of surrounding circumstances and relevant regulations, the Claimants assert that the
facts, laws and case law invoked by the Respondent do not undermine the Claimants’

legitimate expectations.**”’ Specifically, the Claimants argue that the Respondent is

estopped from relying on the tariff deficit which pre-existed the commitments it made
under RD 661/2007, and in any case, the Claimants could not have expected, at the time of
their investments, that the tariff deficit could affect their feed-in remuneration to the small-
hydro sector, which accounted for only a fraction of the regulated costs to the Spanish

electricity system.***

The Claimants submit that they were not on notice of potential adverse changes despite the
evolution of the regulatory framework.**? On the contrary, RD 661/2007 provided
guarantees against adverse, retroactive regulatory changes and provided investors with
greater predictability.““° Even the regulatory changes introduced by Spain in 2010 to the
PV sector are said to reinforce this conclusion precisely because they were PV-specific,
since the PV sector was a major contributor to the regulated costs of the electricity system

(while small-hydro’s contribution was negligible).“!

Accordingly, the Claimants argue that the measures introduced by Spain in 2010 were not
comparable to the 2013 measures as they had a limited impact on the PV sector and were

not relevant to the small-hydro sector.*#?

In addition, the Claimants dismiss case law cited by the Respondent, noting that the vast
majority of those cases were issued after the Claimants’ investments in 2011 and involve
facts distinguishable from the present case.*4? Similarly, with respect to the Respondent’s
reliance on decisions by the Charanne v Spain and Isolux v Spain tribunals, the Claimants
argue that those cases are not relevant as they involved a different renewable energy sector

(PV, as opposed to small-hydro) and concerned different facts. Moreover, neither media

reports nor the Claimants’ transaction documents demonstrate knowledge of future

changes to the RD 661/2007 regime.

The Claimants further argue that, at the time of their investments in 2011, the Respondent
had expressly indicated that existing investments made under RD 661/2007 would
not be affected by any adverse future changes, and that this understanding was
confirmed by government institutions such as IDAE, financial institutions, and other

market participants.“

With regard to supporting documents that the Respondent introduced on the record in its
rejoinder to allege that other market participants were aware that Spain could revoke
RD 661/2007, the Claimants argue that: (a) the Respondent quoted the documents
misleadingly and selectively; (b) none of the documents concerned the small-hydro sector;
(c) a number of the documents introduced were post-investment; and (d) none of the
documents could have put an investor on notice of the possibility of revocation of

RD 661/2007.4%”

Finally, the Claimants highlight that their position “is not (and has never been) that they
expected that Spain would ‘petrify’ its regulatory framework ... Claimants’ case is that
Spain cannot modify its laws in a manner that is inconsistent with its specific promises and
representations, and resulting legitimate expectations, as to how it would modify its laws

in the future with respect to existing investments”.“*

Based on the above, the Claimants conclude that the Respondent’s disputed measures
frustrated the Claimants’ legitimate expectations at the time of their investments by

repealing the RD 661/2007 regime in its entirety, in breach of the FET standard.”

(iii) Respondent Failed to Act in a Transparent Manner and to Respect
Claimants’ Due Process Rights
The Claimants argue that the Respondent failed to act in a transparent manner and to
respect the Claimants’ due process rights.4° The Claimants arguments in support of this

assertion include the following:

First, the disputed measures were contrary to the Respondent’s Renewable Plans of 2005-
2010 and 2011-2020 which noted that the small-hydro sector required further

development.**!

Second, the ability of affected parties to participate in the design of the new regulatory
framework was very limited.*°* The Claimants submit that the Respondent failed to give
them “meaningful opportunity” to participate in adopting the disputed measures or disclose
reports the remuneration parameters were allegedly based on.* According to the
Claimants, they became aware of RD-L 9/2013 only a day before the measure was adopted,
which limited the Claimants’ ability to intervene in the design of the new regulatory

framework.**4

Third, during the eleven months following the enactment of RD-L 9/2013, the Respondent
failed to provide any information as to which remuneration any qualifying plant would be
entitled to. Therefore, the Claimants argue that the Respondent failed to provide

predictability and legal certainty to the Claimants’ investment.**°

Moreover, even after the
enactment of the implementing measures of June 2014, the Respondent failed to define the

precise economic regime that was to apply to qualifying installations.*°°

Fourth, the current regime provides no certainty regarding the applicable remuneration
parameters since all but two of them can be changed by the Government through regulatory

periods of six years (which are in turn divided into two periods of three years each).*°7

Finally, according to the Claimants, the Respondent also failed to disclose the technical
reports on which the remuneration parameters were allegedly based, despite multiple

requests.*8

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s subsequent explanations with
respect to these reports corroborate Claimants’ arguments because they reflect arbitrariness
of the methodology used and raise doubts as to what extent the Respondent relied on the

findings of the report.*?

(iv) Respondent’s actions were arbitrary, unreasonable, disproportionate,
and discriminatory
The Claimants submit that the Respondent also violated the FET standard because the
measures at issue were (i) arbitrary or (ii) unreasonable, (iii) disproportionate, and

(iv) discriminatory.

First, concerning the arbitrariness of the Respondent’s measures, the Claimants argue that
the sudden and retroactive change in the Respondent’s policy with regard to the small-
hydro sector, as well as the constant changes to the regulatory framework applicable to the

Claimants’ investments, were arbitrary.4©°

In addition, the Claimants consider that the New Regime is itself arbitrary, inter alia,
because: it limits payment of the specific remuneration to a maximum period of 25 years
of operation, far shorter than the operational life of hydro plants and the length of hydro-
energy concessions; the new remuneration parameters do not reflect the circumstances of
actual renewable facilities but are instead based on “standard” hypothetical categories of

installations unilaterally defined by Spain; the Respondent has imposed a cap for all

renewable technologies to ensure that the specific remuneration does not go beyond an
arbitrarily defined “ex post target return” of 7.398% pre-tax; and it allows the Respondent
to unilaterally modify at regular intervals the ex-post target return and the new

remuneration parameters for both existing and new facilities.4°!

Second, with respect to the alleged unreasonable nature of the measure, the Claimants
apply Professor Christoph Schreuer’s fourfold test and maintain that the Respondent’s
actions were arbitrary because they: (a) lacked a legitimate purpose; (b) were not based on
acceptable legal standards; (c) were taken for reasons different from purported reasons; and

(d) wilfully disregarded due process and proper procedure.*”

In addition, the Respondent’s measures do not satisfy the reasonableness test because they
were not taken to pursue a rational policy goal nor were they tailored to achieve such goal.
The Claimants highlight that the measures were enacted to cure the result of the
Respondent’s own “regulatory malfeasance”.*? The Claimants argue that the application
of the 7% TVPEE and the Water Levy were unreasonable since the TVPEE was ineffective
to meet its alleged environmental purpose and the Water Levy imposed a tax that was
already paid by the Claimants in existing hydraulic concession royalties.*“* Moreover, the
Claimants rely on BG v Argentina to assert that a unilateral withdrawal of undertakings
given by States in good faith to investors is by definition unreasonable. Accordingly, the
Respondent’s unlawful modification of its regulatory regime was “patently

unreasonable”.“®

Third, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s measures against the small-hydro sector
were disproportionate and in breach of the FET standard because: (a) they did not pursue

a legitimate aim nor were they reasonably connected to the Respondent’s stated

objective;*° (b) the Respondent failed to consider available, less restrictive, alternative
measures for reducing the tariff deficit, for instance by disregarding a National Energy

Commission’s Report which contained 24 alternative measures;*”

and (c) the harm
inflicted on the small-hydro sector by the disputed measures far exceeds the purported
benefit of the Respondent’s objective to reduce the tariff deficit. For instance, under the
current regime 85% of the small-hydro facilities no longer receive any remuneration above
the market price and the share of savings extracted from the small-hydro sector was about
four times higher than the share of its contribution to the costs of the Special Regime, while
the feed-in remuneration to small-hydro accounted for only a fraction of the regulated costs

to the Spanish electricity system.**

The Claimants add that the Respondent has not provided any evidentiary support for its
assertion that the disputed measures were proportionate.’ In fact, contrary to the
Respondent's assertion, neither Spanish court decisions nor international institutions or the
markets have endorsed the proportionality of the Respondent’s disputed measures.*”? For
instance, with regard to an alleged “renewable boom” in the market, the Claimants submit
that the vast majority of transactions from 2013 onwards consist of distressed sales at prices

materially below the original value of the investment.*7!

In addition, the Claimants submit that the regime in which they invested never gave rise to
any concerns of State aid (e.g. there is no finding by any EU institution that the
RD 661/2007 feed-in remuneration regime constituted incompatible EU state aid law),
and therefore the Respondent errs in arguing that an investor should have known that
the Special Regime could constitute illegal State aid and therefore would have to

be repealed.*”*

Finally, the Claimants argue that the Respondent’s treatment of other conventional power
and renewable energy producers reflects the Respondent’s discriminatory treatment against
the Claimants’ investments.*”* In their Reply, for example, the Claimants maintain that
the small-hydro facilities experienced a 92.6% cut in the revenues, which is almost six
times the average cut of 17.85% across all other technologies in the Special Regime.*”
In addition, the Claimants note that the Water Levy only applied to hydropower producers
and not to other renewable energy and conventional power producers.*”> Moreover, the
TVPEE was discriminatory since renewable energy producers were unable to pass through
the additional costs imposed by this tax to consumers while conventional power

producers could.*”°

Based on the above, the Claimants conclude that the Respondent breached the FET clause

of the ECT.

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that it complies with the FET standard of the ECT for the
following reasons: (i) the Respondent did not violate the Claimants’ expectations and
respected the duty to create stable conditions set forth in the ECT; (ii) the Respondent acted
in a transparent manner without infringing upon the Claimants’ due process rights; and
(iii) the measures adopted by the Respondent were reasonable, proportionate, non-

arbitrary, and non-discriminatory. Each of these arguments is analysed below.

(i) Respondent did not Breach Claimants’ Legitimate Expectations nor its

Duty to Create Stable and Equitable Business Framework
The Respondent submits that it did not breach the FET standard because it did not violate
the Claimants’ legitimate expectations, and it respected the duty to create stable conditions

set forth in the ECT.

The Respondent rejects that the Claimants had legitimate expectations because there is no
evidence that the Claimants performed an exhaustive analysis of the applicable legal
framework.*”” For instance, the Claimants failed to establish that they had examined
Spanish case law regarding the rights of renewable energy investor in Spain, prior to
making their investments.‘”® The Claimants’ lack of due diligence means that their

intended expectations cannot be deemed to be real and objective.*””

Moreover, even if a due diligence had been performed by the Claimants, the Respondent
argues that it has not breached the FET standard because: (a) there were no specific
commitments in the Spanish regulatory framework on the future immutability of
the framework of RD 661/2007 in favour of renewable energy facilities;**° (b) the
Claimants’ expectations are not reasonable in light of the regulatory framework actually in
place in Spain, nor can they have arisen out of alleged statements of Spain aimed at
attracting investment;**! (c) the Respondent has respected the duty to create stable
conditions set forth in the ECT; “*? and (d) no retroactive measures in breach of the ECT

have been adopted.**?

First, the Respondent maintains that RD 661/2007 does not provide any guarantee or
commitment to freeze the Respondent’s framework in favour of the Claimants or their

investment.*** The Respondent argues that the regulatory framework only guaranteed a

reasonable rate of return, which is a “level playing field” with ordinary power plants.**>

The Respondent draws attention to multiple case law that examined the Spanish

regulatory framework, which, contrary to the Claimants’ assertions, denied that RD

661/2007 granted investors reasonable expectations that the regulatory framework would

remain unchanged.**°

Second, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ expectations are not objective nor
reasonable with respect to the regulatory framework in place and all relevant
circumstances.**” The Respondent asserts that the Claimants knew or should have known
essential principles of Spain’s regulatory framework, including, inter alia, the following:
that subsidies to the special regime are a cost of the Spanish electricity system; the principle
of a reasonable rate of return within the framework of a sustainable Spanish electricity
system; that the subsidies were determined according to the evolution of the demand and
other basic economic data; and that the successive regulatory changes adopted by the
Respondent were motivated by the need to correct situations of over-remuneration and

guarantee the sustainability of the system. ***

Also, the Respondent claims that the Claimants could not have been unaware of the limits
to subsidies for renewable energies derived from EU law and therefore the Claimants could

not have expectations that they had acquired a right to receive public subsidies.**?

Moreover, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ argument is based on insufficient
evidence. The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ reliance on alleged statements of Spain
aimed at attracting investment, including presentations made by CNE workers (which were
in Spanish and not targeted at foreign investors), a presentation by InvestSpain (an
advertising brochure uncapable of creating objective expectations for diligent investors),
informal conversations with IDAE employees, and a press release announcing the future

publication of RD 661/2007.*”°

The Respondent points to other public statements and behaviours made during the time of
the Claimants’ investments that provided warnings for possible changes to the regulatory
frame in cases of over-remuneration or possible unsustainability of the market.*?!
In addition, the Respondent notes that the Claimants’ expectations were not shared by other
relevant investors, which evidences that the Claimants’ assertion is based on the Claimants’

own subjective expectations.*”” The Respondent considers that the Claimants were aware

or should have been aware of these circumstances.*”

The Respondent further claims that in Spain, courts control the regulatory power and the
legality of an administrative action; therefore, an investor’s due diligence process should
not neglect the importance of Supreme Court case law.*°* With regard to the Claimants’
argument that Supreme Court judgments could not have affected their expectations, the
Respondent submits that the Claimants attempt to mischaracterise the role of jurisprudence
in the Spanish framework when, in fact, the Spanish Supreme Court had ruled that
regulatory changes were permissible provided that the Government respected the principle

of a reasonable rate of return.“?°

The Respondent dismisses the Claimants’ reliance on Masdar v Spain to establish that there
was no Supreme Court case law that could have put them on notice of the possibility of
regulatory changes and argues that contrary to what the Masdar v Spain tribunal found,

three Supreme Court judgments of December 2009 examined RD 661/2007.*°

Third, the Respondent submits that it has respected the duty to create stable conditions
reflected in the ECT.*°” The Respondent claims that it maintained the essential nature of

the regulatory framework in which the Claimants made their investments by ensuring that

the Claimants were able to obtain a reasonable rate of return and recover investment and

operating costs.*°*

The Respondent submits that the obligation to create “stable conditions” set forth in ECT
Article 10(1) of the ECT has been respected, inter alia, since the contested measures:
(a) maintained the subsidies for renewables as a cost of the Spanish electricity system tied
to their sustainability; (b) maintained the priority of access and dispatch; (c) maintained the
principle that the remuneration of the special regime consists of a subsidy which allows
investors to receive a reasonable rate of return; (d) maintained the methodology whereby
subsidies are determined; and (e) resolved a situation of imbalance which jeopardized the
economic sustainability of the Spanish energy system.*”? The Respondent notes that these
essential elements were recognized by the Charanne v Spain award.°™ In this regard, the
Respondent rejects the Claimants’ reliance in the Eiser v Spain award, since such award
does not discuss the essential elements established in the Charanne v Spain case; instead,
it ignores them and incorrectly assumes that regulators should adjust the regulatory

framework to the subjective behavior of investors.*°!

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ references to other “essential elements” of the
Spanish regulatory framework because such elements have not been recognized in any
award and they did not exist during the Claimants’ investment; therefore, they are not

soot 2
admissible.*°?

For instance, to claim that the RD 661/2007 regime was based on
maximization of production is incorrect since the Claimants invested at a time (2011) when
they knew that the Government had limited the subsidized hours to other renewable energy
sectors. The Claimants could also not reasonably have expected unlimited profits based
on EU regulations of State aid. Also, regarding the Claimants’ argument that the
RD 661/2007 regime was based on Spain’s desire to increase its renewable energy

capacity, the Claimants should have known that the objectives were defined in periodic

ignored that there had been modifications over time for renewable energies technologies.*>

Fourth, the Respondent asserts that the disputed measures are not retroactive under
international law in that they only applied to “future events” and did not affect acquired
rights.°°* The Respondent also notes that its Supreme Court and the Council of State have
confirmed the non-retroactive nature of the modifications, given that they apply to the

future without affecting acquired rights.°”

Moreover, the Respondent highlights that some of the Claimants’ plants were built decades
prior to the enactment of RD 661/2007 and hence they could never have expected the

petrification of a future remuneration framework when they were built.°°°

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent claims, as further evidence of the Claimants’ lack of
legitimate expectations, that they made investments in the Spanish PV sector in 2009,°”
that the Claimants’ parent company filed a claim against Spain prior to its investments in
2011 for breach of the ECT arising out of 2010 measures in relation to facilities registered
with the RAIPRE,>™”® and that internal documents and contracts of the Claimants and their
related enterprises show that they were aware of the regulatory risks and warnings of the

Spanish Government.*”

The Respondent further submits that the Claimants failed to seek the necessary due
diligence that any diligent investor would have sought after the measures of 2010.°!° In
view of this lack of due diligence, the alleged infringement of the Claimants’ legitimate

expectations must be rejected.*!! Even if the Claimants had performed a due diligence, the

Respondent submits that the contested measures did not breach the objective legitimate
expectations of the Claimants since (a) there was no specific commitment in the Spanish
regulatory framework on the future immutability of the framework of RD 661/2007 in
favor of renewable energy facilities; (b) the Claimants’ expectations are not reasonable and
justified in relation to the contested measures; (c) Spain respected the duty to create stable
conditions set forth in the ECT; and (d) no retroactive measures in breach of the ECT have

been adopted.*!?

In its Rejoinder, the Respondent submits that due diligence reports submitted by the
Claimants only show that they were warned about possible changes in the tariffs of
RD 661/2007.53

(ii) Respondent acted in a Transparent Manner without Infringing upon
the Claimants’ Due Process Rights

The Respondent denies lack of transparency with respect to both the publication of the
disputed measures and the procedure followed for the adoption of the measures.*!*

In particular, the Respondent submits the following:

Spain has been transparent, since, in any case: (i) it has justified and
publicised the need for the reforms; (ii) it has followed the legally
established procedures, without any unjustified delays; (iii) it has
guaranteed participation in the regulatory process by the holders of
legitimate rights; (iv) it has not incurred in retroactivity contrary to
the legal framework; (v) it has not hidden any information that
would affect the drafting of the reforms; and (vi) it has approved a
regulatory system that is predictable and dynamic.*!>

First, the Respondent argues that the justification for reforming the electrical sector was
shared publicly over time, in a clear and foreseeable manner, accompanied by relevant

legislative changes such as the Electricity Sector Act in 2011.°!°

Second, with respect to the transitional period of eleven months that was taken to approve
MO IET/1045/2014, the Respondent highlights that the sector was “well aware” of the
drafts in the preparation of RD 432/2014 and of MO IET/1045/2014 because hearings were
provided for all stakeholders and there were multiple pleadings by interested parties
including renewable energy producers and associations from the sector.*!7 The
Respondent argues that these parties participated actively and were “clearly aware of the
reduced margins for the final wording of the remuneration parameters”.*!® The Respondent
also notes that contrary to what the Claimants assert, the delay of eleven months was a
consequence of the time spent in reviewing the volume of observations received, and

therefore is justified.*!”

Third, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion that the Respondent limited the
Claimants’ ability to intervene in the framing of the new legal regime and argues that
interested parties were granted participation in multiple occasions, and that the measures

were preceded by a broad debate with the renewable energy sector.>”°

Fourth, the Respondent argues that it has not violated the duty of transparency because the

disputed measures are not retroactive.>”!

Fifth, the Respondent acknowledges that the report issued by Roldan Berger was received
after the approval of both RD 413/2014 and MO IET/1045/2014.°*? The Respondent
explains that the report was only a “technical support” for IDAE in the preparation of the
analysis of the costs of the plants, and therefore, was not determinant for drafting the
order.*** Consequently, the Respondent argues that the report does not affect the

transparency analysis under the ECT.**

Sixth, the Respondent submits that the regulatory periods of three or six years established
by the new legal regime are predictable and constitute an element of security for investors.

Therefore, these periods provide stability for the value of the investment.*”°

Given that Spain publicised the disputed measures well in advance of their enactment,
allowed public participation and developed the reforms in accordance with the applicable
legal provisions, the Respondent asserts that it has complied with its obligation of acting

in a transparent manner, and respected due process.>”°

(iii) The measures adopted by Respondent were reasonable, proportionate,
non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory
The Respondent alleges that the measures at issue were (i) reasonable, (ii) proportional,

(iii) non-arbitrary, and (iv) non-discriminatory.

First, regarding the reasonability of the measures, the Respondent mentions that: the
Spanish energy system faced unsustainable economic circumstances in 2012;*2” the
remuneration method challenged by the Claimants was expressly proposed by the
renewable energy sector in 2009;°°8 the contested measures have been accepted by
domestic and foreign investors as reasonable and attractive (in fact, there was a “boom in
renewable energy” in 2015);>*? and the Claimants’ plants will receive a total after-tax

return of 17.2%, which is reasonable and proportionate.**”

In addition, the Respondent argues that the measures are reasonable and compliant with
the FET standard because they were (a) based on a rational policy, and (b) reasonable in
relation to the policy.>*! The Respondent maintains that the contested measures were based

on a rational policy to control the tariff deficit and protect consumers, and constitute an

admissible public policy interest according to relevant precedents.” Moreover, the
measures were reasonable because they affected all interested parties and there is an
appropriate correlation between the objective of the public policy (to deal with the tariff
deficit) and the measures adopted to reach this objective (by allowing investors to receive

a reasonable rate of return).>**

Second, in addressing the Claimants’ assertion that the measures at issue were
disproportionate, the Respondent dismisses the Occidental v Ecuador case cited by the
Claimants as irrelevant, on the basis that the case did not interpret the ECT.**4 The
Respondent further argues that, in any case, the Claimants’ arguments based on the criteria
set forth in Occidental v Ecuador are unfounded.**> Among other reasons, the Respondent
submits that the Claimants relied on proposed alternatives without examining their
feasibility, and therefore, have not demonstrated that the disputed measures were more
restrictive than other alternatives for achieving its aim.**° The Respondent adds that the
proportionality of the measures at issue has been confirmed by the European Commission,
domestic State bodies including the Spanish Constitutional Court, and other international

organizations such as the International Monetary Fund.**”

Third, regarding the prohibition of “arbitrariness”, the Respondent submits that this is not
an independent standard of protection under Article 10(1) of the ECT and Spain discusses

it within the above-mentioned standards of reasonableness and proportionality.>**

Fourth, the Respondent argues that the disputed measures are not discriminatory.
The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that regulatory distinctions made without
justification between things that are like may amount to discriminatory treatment. Among

other reasons, the Respondent submits that the Claimants fail to show to what degree the

different energy sub-sectors may be treated as a valid reference group; and do not
demonstrate in what way they have been discriminated in comparison to other investors in

the hydraulic sector when all renewable energy producers were affected by the reforms.**°

The Respondent also claims that the disputed measures are not discriminatory based on
Dr Schreuer’s fourfold test that was adopted by the EDF v Romania tribunal.**° According
to the Respondent, in addition to serving a legitimate purpose, the measures were
implemented in accordance with the relevant laws in place and Spanish Supreme Court
case law, adopted for the same reasons announced by the President of the Government in
2011 (i.e. adopted for the same reasons put forward by the decision maker), and adopted

in full compliance with due process and following the proper legal procedures.*#!

In conclusion, the Respondent argues that the measures were based on a rational policy and
were carried out in a reasonable, proportional, and non-discriminatory manner. Hence, it

has complied with the FET standard under the ECT.*#?

The Respondent maintains that its measures were reasonable and non-discriminatory.>*

The Respondent also contends that the Claimants’ investments suffered no impairment
because the Claimants’ Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) came to 16.4%, surpassing a

“reasonable rate of return”.*4°

(2) The Applicable Legal Standard

Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that “no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures [the] management, maintenance, use, enjoyment

or disposal [of Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties]”.**”

Both Parties seem to agree that Article 10(1) of the ECT prohibits impairment measures

that are either unreasonable or discriminatory.**

a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit that in meeting the standard of reasonableness, as examined in the
context of the FET standard, the Respondent must show that the measures at issue were
taken in pursuance of a rational policy goal and that they were appropriately tailored to
achieve the goal.**? The Claimants note that the analysis for reasonable and non-

discriminatory treatment under the FET standard is also applicable here.>*”

With respect to ‘impairment’, the Claimants submit that the concept must be determined
by assessing the objective impact that the measures at issue had on the investments.*°! The
Claimants further argue that the concept cannot be measured by the Respondent’s

subjective notion of a “reasonable rate of return”.*>*

10(1) of the ECT requires the existence of an impairment.>>+

(3) The Claim

a. The Claimants’ Position

408. The Claimants submit that the Respondent violated the standard of non-impairment under
the ECT because the Respondent’s measures were both unreasonable and discriminatory

for the same reasons set out under their FET standard analysis.°°>

409. In arguing that the contested measures inflicted impairment on the Claimants’ investments,
the Claimants argue that the measures have “wiped out the entirety of the value of
Claimants’ investments”.°°° In their Reply, the Claimants maintain that the Claimants’
investments lost the value and economic benefits, which amount to an impairment.>*’

Furthermore, the Claimants assert that the IRR analysis relied on by the Respondent is

“fundamentally flawed”.>°*

b. The Respondent’s Position

410. The Respondent contends that the Claimants did not suffer any impairment because,
according to Econ One’s analysis, the Claimants’ IRR came to 16.4%, which surpasses

Spain’s supposed reasonable rate of return.*?

Moreover, in the Respondent’s view, the standard of non-impairment under the ECT has

been respected since the disputed measures are reasonable and proportional.>°

For instance, the Respondent notes that the disputed measures were a reaction to the
unsustainable economic circumstances of the Spanish energy system and were in fact
proposed by the renewable sector.*°! Moreover, the current regulatory regime has attracted
more than EUR 5,000 million in investments and this reflects the measures’ proportionality

and reasonableness.>

In addition, the Respondent argues that the Claimants have not shown, inter alia, that they
were treated differently than other similarly situated investors, if there were any, and

maintains that the measures affected all renewable energy producers.**

The Respondent further argues that the measures pass other tests referring to the ECT’s
objectives, including those applied in EDF v Romania and AES v Hungary, and therefore

are not discriminatory or unreasonable.*™

D. Alleged Breach of Most Constant Protection and Security Standard under
Article 10(1) of the ECT

Claimants claim that the Respondent breached this obligation by dismantling the legal

framework on which the Claimants’ investments relied.*°

The Respondent distinguishes the MCPS standard from the FET standard and considers
that the Claimants have not accredited any fact that could lead to a breach of this obligation,
since they merely rely on the same facts used to address an alleged breach of the FET
standard.**” In any event, the Respondent affirms that it has provided full protection and

security to the Claimants’ investments.>°

(2) The Applicable Legal Standard

Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that investments shall “enjoy the most constant

protection and security”.

a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that the MCPS standard requires a State to take all necessary measures
to protect and ensure the legal security of the investments made by protected investors in

the form of certainty of norms and foreseeability of application.*?

Contrary to the Respondent’s suggestion, the Claimants argue, with reference to the
findings of the Biwater v Tanzania and the AES v Hungary tribunals, that the MCPS
standard is not limited to protection against acts by a third party and extends to actions by

organs and representatives of the State.>””

The Claimants argue that even if this ECT standard was not deemed to encompass the full
protection and security standard commonly incorporated in investment treaties, the

Respondent would still be required to provide this treatment by the operation of the MFN

clause in Article 10(7) of the ECT.°7! The Claimants do not seem to have made further
references to this argument in their Reply, at the Hearing, nor in their post-hearing

submissions.

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent maintains that the concept of the MCPS is different than the FET
standard.*”* Given that the guarantee of providing stable, transparent or reasonable
conditions to the investor already fall within the FET standard, such guarantee cannot also
constitute a part of the MCPS standard in the ECT.” In any event, the Respondent
maintains that the FET standard does not grant investors a right to “the petrification or

freezing of Government legislation”.°”*

The Respondent cites AES v Hungary and Professors Dolzer and Schreuer, emphasizing
that the MCPS standard does not provide protection against a State’s right to legislate or
regulate in a reasonable manner and in accordance with the circumstances.*” It also refers
to the Electrabel v Hungary case in support that States have a legitimate right to regulate
in the public interest and therefore a host State is not required to “elevate unconditionally

the interests of the foreign investor above all other considerations”.>”°

According to the Respondent, the MCPS standard refers to the guarantee that a State will
use “due diligence” to protect investors against injuries caused by third parties or to provide

remedies when such injuries occur.>””

(3) The Claim

a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants claim that the Respondent breached its obligation under the MCPS standard
because it failed to ensure legal certainty of the investments by dismantling the legal

framework on which the Claimants’ investments were relied upon.*””

In the Claimants’ words, “Spain ... violated its obligations to ensure that the agreed and
approved security and protection of the Claimants’ investments was not withdrawn or

devalued either by the amendment of its laws or by the actions of its executive bodies”.**°

The Claimants argue that the Respondent modified its laws in a manner that was not
consistent with the commitment it guaranteed to the Claimants’ investments.**! In support
of their argument, the Claimants rely on the reasons considered under the FET standard, as

summarized above.**”

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that it has not breached the MCPS standard.*** The Respondent
argues that the Claimants have failed to establish facts suggesting that the Respondent has

failed to practice due diligence in preventing injuries to their investments.***

Also, the Respondent claims that, based on the elements required by doctrine and case law,
it has respected the MCPS standard because the measures were proportionate and
reasonable in accordance with the circumstances.**° Among other reasons, the Respondent
submits that the Claimants’ investments received the most constant protection and security
in light of: (a) the factual background, including the tariff deficit and the need to halt rising
tariffs for consumers; (b) the State’s right to regulate in the public interest; and (c) the
adoption of reasonable measures in accordance with the existing economic circumstances
which have respected the essential elements of the regulatory framework in which the
Claimants invested, including the maintenance of a reasonable rate of return for renewable

energy producers to achieve the stabilisation of the tariff deficit.>*°

Finally, the Respondent rejects that the MCPS standard may be applied in this case by
means of the MEN clause of the ECT because the Claimants have not made any reference
to the treaties signed by Spain on which they base themselves to assert that other foreign
investors have received better treatment (i.e. MCPS) under treaties other than the ECT, and
because in any case the Claimants only refer to the same arguments concerning an alleged

breach of the FET standard.**”
Based on the above, the Respondent submits that there has not been an infringement of the

MCPS standard.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

A. Small-hydro

The Claimants say that these are the main characteristics of small-hydro.*** “Small-hydro”
facilities are hydropower installations with an installed capacity of up to 50 MW. Under
Spanish law, hydropower generators must obtain from the State: (a) administrative

concessions for the private use of water; (b) administrative authorisations for the

434.

construction and operation of the relevant plant; (c) approval of the project execution plan;
and (d) approval of the final construction works, and the obtaining of the commissioning
certificate. They are particularly efficient in terms of the environment and energy cost.
The technology is versatile (i.e. it can be used under a wide variety of water flow levels
and head heights), and is compatible with other economic uses, such as water for

agricultural irrigation or human consumption.

Small-hydro facilities have a long asset life, with many facilities operating more than
50 years when properly maintained. The small-hydro sector makes significant economic
and social contributions in the form of concession payments to hydrographic
confederations and water agencies, and public entities. The sector helps to create local jobs
and infrastructure in the rural areas where such facilities are most commonly built, because
these facilities have maintenance requirements that exceed those of other renewable assets
such as wind or solar PV installations. There was a broad consensus across the political
spectrum on the merits of small-hydro and on the need to increase its installed base, in
particular to meet Spain’s renewable energy targets under both international environmental
protection conventions and EU directives. The contribution of the small-hydro incentives
regime to the electricity system’s regulated costs has, in any event, been very limited. The
small-hydro incentives under RD 661/2007 accounted for only 1.1% of the system’s
regulated costs in 2013; and small-hydro was the technology which contributed the least to

the regulated costs of the system between 2008 and 2013.

At the time of the Claimants’ investments, the majority of small-hydro assets in Spain
(i.e. approximately 58% of the installed base) was owned by large Spanish utilities, semi-
public entities such as farmers’ cooperatives and municipalities, and the Spanish State,

through the IDAE.

B. The Investments*”

Each of the Claimants’ plants was certified as meeting the criteria necessary to qualify for
the RD 661/2007 regime by the relevant Spanish authorities (including through registration
in the RAIPRE).

Each of the hydropower plants had been commissioned, and was in full operation, when
the Claimants invested in them. There is some disagreement as to when the plants were
“commissioned”,>” but it appears that the Xana plants were put into operation between
1990 and 2004, without any expansion of the installed capacity after that date; and the
Ondina plants were put into operation between 1906 and 1986, and most of their installed

capacity has been operational since 1950.°7!

According to the Respondent, since all the hydraulic plants that the Claimants purchased
were already in operation at the time of their acquisition (some ever since the beginning of
the 20th century), and did not carry out any expansion of their installed capacity, the

? and their

Claimants did not contribute to achieving any installed power objective;>”
acquisition reflects a purely financial investment scheme, and was not made with the aim
of increasing the installed capacity of the plants.*°? In both cases the object was to make
acquisitions in special situations (in the case of Xana “the distressed nature of the sellers”)

and to sell them ultimately to utilities.

The Claimants say that their initial objective was to purchase one or two of the larger
portfolios of existing small-hydro plants, and subsequently acquire other smaller portfolios
and new projects for construction. Once they had acquired those assets, they intended to
use their expertise to improve operational performance (typically through capital

expenditure investments), maximize electricity production and reduce operating costs, and

pay out dividends from operating cash flows. Ultimately they intended to sell the “de-

risked” assets at a profit, to passive long-term institutional investors.°”*

The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimants made relevant investments, and that the
circumstances in which they were made, and their ultimate purpose, has no bearing on the

issues in this arbitration.

C. The Overall Nature of the Case

Although the Claimants’ overall case has many strands, their case on FET and legitimate

expectations has two main elements.

The first” is that the rights granted by RD 661/2007 amounted to a commitment (or, as it
is sometimes put, a guarantee*”°) that small-hydro plants (a) could sell all of their electricity
output; (b) at either a regulated tariff or a premium on the market price; (c) for pre-
established amounts revised yearly for inflation; (d) for the plants’ entire operational
lifetime; and (e) free from any future downward reviews or alterations to the specified feed-
in remuneration rates or term. Connected with that way of putting the case is the contention
that in other respects the Spanish State gave assurances or made representations to the same

or similar effect.°””

The Claimants say***

that this is not a case of investors seeking to rely on “general
statements in treaties or legislation which, because of their nature of general regulations,

can evolve”.°” Rather it is a case of Spain granting specific rights to specific small-hydro

plants in order to induce private investment, and then substantially altering and revoking

those rights after the investments had been made.

The second, and more general way of putting their case, is that the FET standard,
irrespective of any commitments, assurances, or representations, protects the legitimate
expectations of investors regarding the key terms of their investment and the stability of
the host state’s legal and business framework upon which an investor reasonably relied in

making its investment.°”

' is that in line with the business associations in the

The Respondent’s overall case®
renewable energy sector, the main companies that operated in the Spanish renewable
energy sector accepted that (i) regulatory measures affecting plants in operation were
possible, (ii) these measures could reduce the remuneration granted by previous
regulations, (iii) these measures may be based on guaranteeing the economic sustainability
of the Spanish electricity system and correcting situations of over-remuneration, and (iv)
the limit to the new regulatory measures lies in the fact that they must provide the plants
with a reasonable rate of return. The ECT does not oblige States to maintain a regulatory
framework that is stable and predictable for all investments and during its entire validity.
Article 10(1) of the ECT alludes to “stable conditions”, not to a “predictable framework”.
In no case is the power of the States to modify the regulatory framework to maintain an

efficient energy market nullified or limited.

The Claimants objectively could not be unaware of the purpose of the subsidies for
renewable energies (reaching a level playing field) and the limits derived from
EU legislation on State aid to avoid market distortion, such as the energy market. These
limits prevent the Claimants from having expectations that they had acquired a right to
receive public subsidies. Neither the Claimants nor their parent companies could have
been unaware of these regulations or have expected the subsidies to remain unchanged for

25 or 30 years even if they distort the energy market.

D. Jurisdiction
(1) The EU Issue

a. Introduction

The first Claimant is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg, and the second Claimant
is incorporated under the laws of Sweden. Luxembourg was an original member of the
European Economic Community (“EEC”). Spain joined the European Community on
1 January 1986. Sweden joined the EU on | January 1995. Luxembourg and Sweden
ratified the ECT in February 1997 and November 1997 respectively. Spain ratified the
ECT in December 1997. The ECT entered into force on 16 April 1998.

The relevant European treaty provisions at the time the ECT entered into force were those
of the Treaty establishing the European Community (“TEC”), but there is no material
difference between the versions of the relevant articles since their inception in the EEC

Treaty and their present iteration in the TFEU.

The arguments of the Parties have been summarised above and it is only necessary at this

stage to emphasise these points.
The Respondent’s arguments can largely be allocated between two main arguments.

The first main point is that, on the proper interpretation of the principal provisions of the
ECT, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction. The second main point, with some overlap with the

first point, is that intra-EU disputes are outside the competence of the Tribunal.

Within the first point may be included the arguments that (J) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention because the Claimants hold dual Luxembourg-
European and Swedish-European nationality; and (2) that Article 26 ECT does not generate
obligations between the EU Member States, because the Member States of the then
European Community were unable to contract obligations between them as regards the
Internal Market (as it is an area in which they had transferred their sovereignty to the then

European Community) and for this reason the EU is a Contracting Party to the ECT.

131

452.

453.

454,

455.

Within the second main point, that intra-EU disputes are outside the competence of the
Tribunal, are the arguments that (1) the Achmea ruling applies to multilateral treaties such
as the ECT; (2) EU law is international law; (3) EU law is paramount and displaces any
other national or international provision; (4) EU law (such as the law relating to issues in
the arbitration) applies to claims in the arbitration; and (5) the Tribunal would be interfering

with the EU judicial system.

The European Commission’s amicus curiae submission dated 3 December 2018 supports
the Respondent’s position, and in particular refers to (1) Commission Decision SA.40348
of 10 November 2017 that the contested measures did not violate the investment protection
provisions of the ECT and that Article 26 ECT does not apply intra-EU; and (2) the
Commission communication “Protection of Intra-EU Investment” of 19 July 2018 to the

same effect.

The Commission accepts that the Tribunal is competent to rule on its jurisdiction and
applicable law under the ICSID Convention, but says that if the offer in the ECT by the
Respondent to accept arbitration was inapplicable as a result of the principle in the Achmea
ruling, then there would be no consent to arbitration. EU law has a special conflict of laws

rule, namely the primacy of EU law.*”

The Commission also observes that the Treaty of
Lisbon post-dated the ECT, and re-stated the provisions on which the Achmea ruling relied
in holding that the investor-State dispute resolution provisions in the BIT were
incompatible with EU law. Accordingly, the effect of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties (“WCLT”), Article 30, is that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU take precedence

over Article 26 ECT.

b. The Starting Point

The obvious starting point is the express wording of the jurisdiction and choice of

law provisions.

2. Costa v ENEL; and TFEU (RL-0001), Declaration 17 annexed to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference
which adopted the Treaty of Lisbon, 13 December 2007.

458.

Energy Charter Treaty: The effect of Article 26(1)-(3) is that where there arise “Disputes
between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an
Investment of the latter in the Area of the former” which cannot be settled amicably, then
the Investor party may submit it to a form of dispute resolution including ICSID arbitration
“if the Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting Party to the dispute are both
parties to the ICSID Convention” and in such a case “each Contracting Party hereby gives
its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration ... in
accordance with the provisions of this Article” (Article 26(3)(a)), and the Tribunal “shall
decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and

principles of international law” (Article 26(6)).

By Article 1(2) “Contracting Party” means a state or Regional Economic Integration
Organization which has consented to be bound by the ECT and for which the ECT is in
force, and by Article 1(3) “Regional Economic Integration Organization” means an
organization constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over certain
matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty, including the authority to take
decisions binding on them in respect of those matters. By Article 38: “This Treaty shall be
open for signature at Lisbon from 17 December 1994 to 16 June 1995 by the states and
Regional Economic Integration Organizations which have signed the Charter.” The EU is

a Regional Economic Integration Organization, and is a party to the ECT.
Article 16 provides:

Where two or more Contracting Parties have entered into a prior
international agreement, or enter into a subsequent international
agreement, whose terms in either case concern the subject matter of
Part III [“Investment Promotion and Protection”, which includes
Articles 10 and 13] or V [“Dispute Settlement”, which includes
Article 26] of this Treaty,

(1) nothing in Part III or V of this Treaty shall be construed to
derogate from any provision of such terms of the other
agreement or from any right to dispute resolution with respect
thereto under that agreement; and

(2) nothing in such terms of the other agreement shall be construed
to derogate from any provision of Part III or V of this Treaty or

133

459.

460.

461.

462.

463.

from any right to dispute resolution with respect thereto under
this Treaty,

where any such provision is more favourable to the Investor or

Investment.
ICSID Convention: By Article 25(1): “The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any
legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that
State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent
in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may

withdraw its consent unilaterally.”
By Article 41(1): “The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.”

By Article 42(1): “The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law
as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply
the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of
laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.” As indicated above,

Article 26(6) ECT contains a separate choice of law provision.

The combined effect of these provisions on the face of their wording is that the Tribunal
has jurisdiction where the investor is a national of a Contracting State and the respondent

State is a Contracting State.

c. The Nationality Point

The Respondent says that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention because (J) the Claimants hold dual Luxembourg-European and Swedish-
European nationality; (2) Article 20 TFEU establishes that all citizens of an EU Member
State simultaneously hold European nationality; (3) the EU and the Member States made
an express declaration regarding Article 25 ECT to clarify that legal persons incorporated
in accordance with the legislation of any Member State should be treated in the same way
as natural persons who are nationals of the Member States; (4) Article 25(2)(a) of the

ICSID Convention precludes natural persons with dual nationality from filing an arbitration

134

464.

465.

466.

467.

claim; and (5) accordingly, because the Claimants hold dual nationality, they do not meet

the jurisdictional requirement of Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal rejects this argument. Article 20 TFEU establishes a separate category of EU
citizenship for nationals of EU Member States. It does not create dual nationality, and
Article 25(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention does not apply to corporations and is not engaged
by the declaration that legal persons incorporated in accordance with the legislation of any
Member State should be treated in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of

the Member States for the purposes of Article 25 ECT.

d. The Regional Economic Integration Organization (REIO) Point and
the “Area” Point
These points are linked, although the REIO point arises also as a subset of the intra-EU
argument, but it is convenient to deal with them together. The Respondent says that: (1) the
ECT acknowledges the special nature of the EU as an international organisation constituted
by States to which they have transferred competence over certain matters in an irrevocable
and binding way;®” and (2) when the ECT was signed, the Member States of the then
European Community were unable to contract obligations between them as regards the
Internal Market as it is an area in which they had transferred their sovereignty to the then
European Community. For that reason, the EU is a Contracting Party, the relevant Area is
that of the EU and not of an EU Member State and accordingly Article 26 ECT does not

generate any obligations between the Member States.°*
The provisions of the ECT on which reliance has been placed are as follows:

By Article 1:

(2) “Contracting Party” means a state or Regional Economic
Integration Organization which has consented to be bound by
[the ECT] and for which the Treaty is in force.

3 Resp. C-Mem., 67.
04 Resp. C-Mem., { 80.

135

468.

469.

(3) “Regional Economic Integration Organization” means an
organization constituted by states to which they have transferred
competence over certain matters a number of which are
governed by this Treaty, including the authority to take
decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.

(10) “Area” means with respect to a state that is a Contracting Party:

(a) the territory under its sovereignty, it being understood that
territory includes land, internal waters and the territorial
sea; ...

With respect to a Regional Economic Integration Organization
which is a Contracting Party, Area means the Areas of the member
states of such Organization, under the provisions contained in the
agreement establishing that Organization.

By Article 25:

(1) The provisions of this Treaty shall not be so construed as to
oblige a Contracting Party which is party to an Economic
Integration Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “EIA”) to
extend, by means of most favoured nation treatment, to another
Contracting Party which is not a party to that EIA, any
preferential treatment applicable between the parties to that EIA
as a result of their being parties thereto.

(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1), “EIA” means an agreement
substantially liberalizing, inter alia, trade and investment, by
providing for the absence or elimination of substantially all
discrimination between or among parties thereto through the
elimination of existing discriminatory measures and/or the
prohibition of new or more discriminatory measures, either at
the entry into force of that agreement or on the basis of a
reasonable time frame.

By Article 36(7):

A Regional Economic Integration Organization shall, when voting,
have a number of votes equal to the number of its member states
which are Contracting Parties to this Treaty; provided that such an
Organization shall not exercise its right to vote if its member states
exercise theirs, and vice versa.

136

470.

471.

472.

The Tribunal considers that these provisions do not assist the Respondent in its objections
to jurisdiction. Article 26(1) plainly means that the “[i]nvestment ... in the Area of the
former”, i.e. the Contracting Party, is an investment in the national territory of the
respondent State. The fact that the EU is also a Contracting Party and a “Regional
Economic International Organization” does not mean in the context of Article 26(1) that
the Area is the territory of the EU as a whole, which would simply make no sense. Nor
can it in itself bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction; nor can the Tribunal’s jurisdiction be removed
by the fact that the ECT recognises that competence may be transferred to such an
Organization, or the fact that in certain circumstances the Organization may vote instead
of the Member States. Article 25 does not prevent REIO members from agreeing to other

obligations under a different treaty regime, such as the ECT.

Nor is there anything express or implied in these provisions which could amount to a
“disconnection clause”, i.e. a provision that disapplies certain provisions of a treaty in

mutual relations between certain parties.

e. The Achmea ruling Point
(i) TFEU

The principally relevant provisions of EU law are as follows:

(LD Article 267 of the TFEU (formerly, with immaterial
differences, Article 177 EEC Treaty and Article 234 TEC)

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction
to give preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a
Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a
decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment,
request the Court to give a ruling thereon.

137

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court
or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no
judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring
the matter before the Court.

(2) Article 344 TFEU (formerly, with immaterial differences,
Article 219 EEC Treaty and Article 292 TEC)

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of
settlement other than those provided for therein.

(3) Article 351 TFEU (formerly, with immaterial differences,
Article 234 EEC Treaty and Article 307 TEC)

The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded

their accession, between one or more Member States on the one
hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be

To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the
Treaties, the Member State or States concerned shall take all
appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established.
Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end
and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common attitude.

In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph,
Member States shall take into account the fact that the advantages
accorded under the Treaties by each Member State form an integral
part of the establishment of the Union and are thereby inseparably
linked with the creation of common institutions, the conferring of
powers upon them and the granting of the same advantages by all
the other Member States.

474. Both Parties®> have relied on the VCLT, although several parties to the ECT are not, or
(like the EU) cannot be, parties to the VCLT, but the provisions relied on by them codify
customary international law relating to the interpretation of treaties. The VCLT provides
in Article 30 (which is headed “Application of successive treaties relating to the same

subject-matter”):

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the
rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating
to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with
the following paragraphs.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later
treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation ..., the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its
provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.

4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties
to the earlier one:

(a) As between States Parties to both treaties the same rule applies
as in paragraph 3;

(b) As between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only
one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties
governs their mutual rights and obligations.

475. By Article 31 (“General rule of interpretation’):

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall
comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the
other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its
interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations
between the parties.

f. The Achmea ruling

The underlying arbitration in the Achmea ruling was an UNCITRAL arbitration (with the
PCA as Registry), with a seat in Germany, brought under the Netherlands-Czechoslovakia
BIT by a Dutch investor against Slovakia. The tribunal awarded damages against Slovakia,
which sought, in the German courts, to have the award set aside on the ground (inter alia)
that the award was contrary to public policy because the tribunal was unable to make a

reference to the CJEU on questions of EU law which it had failed to take into account.

So far as material, the questions referred by the Bundesgerichtshof (“BGH”, Federal Court

of Justice of Germany) were:

(1) Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision
in a bilateral investment protection agreement between Member
States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT) under
which an investor of a Contracting State, in the event of a dispute
concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may
bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral
tribunal where the investment protection agreement was
concluded before one of the Contracting States acceded to the
European Union but the arbitral proceedings are not to be
brought until after that date?

140

If Question (1) is to be answered in the negative:

(2) Does Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of such a
provision? ....5%

478. The opinion of M. Wathelet, Advocate General, was that Articles 267 TFEU and 344 TFEU
were to be interpreted as not precluding the application of an investor-State dispute
settlement mechanism established by means of a bilateral investment agreement concluded
before the accession of one of the Contracting States to the European Union and providing
that an investor from one Contracting State might, in the case of a dispute relating to
investments in the other Contracting State, bring proceedings against the latter State before

an arbitral tribunal.
479. In the course of his opinion he said:

Furthermore, all the Member States and the Union have ratified the
Energy Charter Treaty, signed at Lisbon on 19 December 1994.
That multilateral treaty on investment in the field of energy operates
even between Member States, since it was concluded not as an
agreement between the Union and its Member States, of the one part,
and third countries, of the other part, but as an ordinary multilateral
treaty in which all the Contracting Parties participate on an equal
footing. In that sense, the material provisions for the protection of
investments provided for in that Treaty and the [investor-State
dispute settlement] mechanism also operate between Member
States. I note that if no EU institution and no Member State sought
an opinion from the Court on the compatibility of that treaty with
the EU and FEU Treaties, that is because none of them had the
slightest suspicion that it might be incompatible.*”

480. The answer by the CJEU, however, was that Articles 267 and 344 TFEU were to be
interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between
Member States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one Member

State might, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State,

bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose

jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.

The crucial steps in the legal reasoning were:

qd)

(4)

(5)

(6)

An international agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the
Treaties or, consequently, the autonomy of the EU legal system, observance of which

is ensured by the court (at paragraph 32).

That principle is enshrined in particular in Article 344 TFEU, under which the
Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for
in the Treaties: Opinion 2/13 (European Convention on Human Rights)

(at paragraph 32).

The autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the member States and to
international law is justified by the essential characteristics of the EU and its law,
relating in particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the very nature of

that law (at paragraph 33).

EU law is characterised by the fact that it stems from an independent source of law,
the Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by the direct
effect of provisions which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member States

themselves (at paragraph 33).

Those characteristics have given rise to a structured network of principles, rules and
mutually interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its Member States
reciprocally and binding its Member States to each other: Opinion 2/13, paragraphs
165-167 (at paragraph 33).

The Member States are obliged, by reason, inter alia, of the principle of sincere
co-operation, to ensure the application of and respect for EU law, and to take for
those purposes any appropriate measure to ensure fulfilment of the obligations
arising out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the EU:

Opinion 2/13, paragraphs 168 and 173 (at paragraph 34).

142

482.

In order to ensure that the specific characteristics and the autonomy of the EU legal
order, it is for the national courts and tribunals and the CJEU to ensure the full
application of EU law in all Member States and to ensure judicial protection of the

rights of individuals under that law (at paragraphs 35 and 36).

The EU judicial system has as its keystone the preliminary ruling procedure provided
for in Article 267 TFEU, which has the object of securing uniform interpretation of
EU law, thereby serving to ensure its consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as
well as the particular nature of the law established by the Treaties: Opinion 2/13,

paragraph 176 (at paragraph 37).

The application of those principles involved the following steps:

qd)

(2)

G)

(4)

Under the terms of the BIT, Article 8(6), the arbitral tribunal was called on to rule on
possible infringements of the BIT, but in order to do so it was obliged to take account
in particular of the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned and other relevant
agreements between the Contracting Parties, and might therefore be called on to
interpret or indeed to apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the
fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free movement of

capital (at paragraphs 39-42).

The arbitral tribunal was not part of the judicial system of the Netherlands or
Slovakia, and it was the exceptional nature of the tribunal’s jurisdiction compared
with that of the courts of the two Member States that was one of the principal reasons

for the existence of Article 8 of the BIT (at paragraphs 43-45).

Consequently, it could not be classified as a court or tribunal “‘of a member state”

within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU (at paragraphs 46, 49).

Under Article 8(7) of the BIT the decision of the arbitral tribunal was final, and,
pursuant to Article 8(5) of the BIT, the arbitral tribunal was to determine its own
procedure applying the UNCITRAL arbitration rules and was itself to choose its seat
and consequently the law applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of

the validity of the award (at paragraph 51).

143

(5)

(6)

7)

(8)

Because the arbitral tribunal chose to sit in Frankfurt am Main, German law was
applicable to the procedure governing judicial review of the validity of the arbitral
award, but the review was a limited review, concerning in particular the validity of
the arbitration agreement under the applicable law and the consistency with public

policy of the recognition or enforcement of the arbitral award (at paragraphs 52-53).

By contrast with commercial arbitration, where the requirements of efficient
arbitration proceedings justify limited review of arbitral awards by the courts of the
Member States, provided that the fundamental provisions of EU law can be examined
in the course of that review and, if necessary, be the subject of a reference for a
preliminary ruling (Eco Swiss China Time Ltd v Benetton International NV (Case C-
126/97) [1999] ECR I-3055, paragraphs 35, 36 and 40 and Mostaza Claro v Centro
Movil Milenium SL (Case C-168/05) [2006] ECR I-10421, paragraphs 34-39),
arbitration proceedings under Article 8 of the BIT derive from a treaty by which
Member States agree to remove from the jurisdiction of their own courts, and hence
from the system of judicial remedies in the fields covered by EU law (Associagdo
Sindical dos Juizes Portugueses v Tribunal de Contas (Case C-64/16) [2018],
paragraph 34), disputes which may concern the application or interpretation of EU

Jaw (at paragraphs 54-55).

By concluding the BIT, the Member States established a mechanism for
settling disputes between an investor and a Member State which could prevent those
disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensured the full effectiveness of
EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or application of that law

(at paragraph 56).
In a passage on multilateral treaties the CJEU said (at paragraphs 57-58):

It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an
international agreement providing for the establishment of a court
responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose
decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of
Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The
competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its
capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the
power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or

144

designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and
application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the
EU and its legal order is respected (see, to that effect, Opinion 1/91
(EEA Agreement-I) of 14 December 1991, EU:C:1991:490,
paragraphs 40 and 70; Opinion 1/09 (Agreement creating a unified
patent litigation system) of 8 March 2011, EU:C:2011:123,
paragraphs 74 and 76; and Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the
ECHR) of 18 December 2014, EU:C:2014:2454, paragraphs 182
and 183).

In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes
falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in
Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that
agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those
disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU
is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU
but by Member States. Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into
question not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member
States but also the preservation of the particular nature of the law
established by the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary ruling
procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore
compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation ...

483. The operative part of the ruling was:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and
reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under
which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the
event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member
State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an
arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has
undertaken to accept.°?

484. On 15 and 16 January 2019, the 28 EU Member States issued declarations on the legal
consequences of the Achmea ruling. Twenty-two of the Member States (including Spain)
expressed the view that the ruling applied also to international agreements concluded by

the EU, including the ECT, which were an integral part of the EU legal order and must

08 Achmea, 57-58.
9 Achmea, | 62.

145

therefore be compatible with the Treaties. Accordingly, if Article 26(3) were interpreted
as containing an arbitration clause applicable between Member States, “that clause would

be incompatible with the Treaties and thus would have to be disapplied.”°!°

485. Five other Member States (including Luxembourg and Sweden) issued a declaration, which
did not express a view on the effect of the Achmea ruling on multilateral treaties such as

the ECT. They said:

The Achmea case concerns the interpretation of EU law in relation
to an investor-state arbitration clause in a bilateral investment treaty
between Member States. The Member States note that the Achmea
judgment is silent on the investor-state arbitration clause in the
Energy Charter Treaty. A number of international arbitration
tribunals post the Achmea judgment have concluded that the Energy
Charter Treaty contains an investor-State arbitration clause
applicable between EU Member States. This interpretation is
currently contested before a national court in a Member State.*!!
Against this background, the Member States underline the
importance of allowing for due process and consider that it would
be inappropriate, in the absence of a specific judgment on this
matter, to express views as regards the compatibility with Union law
of the intra EU application of the Energy Charter Treaty.°!”

g. Conclusions

486. On this aspect of the objections to jurisdiction, a preliminary point arises as whether the
Achmea ruling has any application to multilateral treaties such as the ECT, to which both

Member States and the EU itself are members.

487. The Achmea ruling concerned BITs, but, as indicated above, M. Wathelet expressed the

view in the course of his opinion that the investor-State provisions in the ECT operated as

between Member States because it was concluded not as an agreement between the EU and
its Member States, of the one part, and third countries, of the other part, but as an ordinary
multilateral treaty in which all the Contracting Parties participate on an equal footing.°?
But his overall view that there was no incompatibility between dispute resolution
provisions in BITs and EU law was not accepted by the CJEU, and therefore only limited

weight can be given to his view on the ECT.

It is therefore necessary to turn to the ruling of the CJEU. The relevant paragraphs have

been quoted above.

What is being said there is that the EU has competence in the field of international relations
to enter into an international agreement providing for the establishment of a court created
or designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and application of their
provisions and whose decisions are binding on the institutions, including the CJEU. This
is not in principle incompatible with EU law, provided that the autonomy of the EU and its

legal order is respected.

There are two reasons for supposing that the CJEU did not express the view that investor-
State dispute resolution procedures in a multilateral agreement such as the ECT were
outside the scope of its intra-EU ruling. The first is that the following paragraph suggests,
by its reference to the BIT being concluded “not by the EU but by Member States”, °!* that
it was mainly directing itself to agreements with third States. The second reason is the
citation of previous rulings, two of which concerned treaties concluded by the European
Community or the European Union with third states: Opinion 1/91 (EEA Agreement - I)
EU:C:1991:490, paragraphs 40 and 70; and Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the
ECHR), EU:C:2014:2454, paragraphs 182 and 183). The third ruling, Opinion 1/09
EU:C:2011:123, concerned the draft Agreement creating a unified patent litigation system,
to which the Member States were parties, and concerned the draft agreement on the

European and Community Patents Court (“EPC”).

491.

492.

In Opinion 1/09 the CJEU ruled that although the CJEU had no jurisdiction to rule on direct
actions between individuals in the field of patents (since that jurisdiction was held by the
courts of the Member States), the Member States could not confer the jurisdiction to resolve
such disputes on a court created by an international agreement which would deprive courts
of their task, as courts within the EU legal order, to implement EU law and, thereby, of the
power or obligation in Article 267 TFEU to refer questions for a preliminary ruling in the

field concerned.
The essence of these decisions is contained in Opinion 2/13, paragraphs 182-184:

The Court of Justice has admittedly already stated in that regard that
an international agreement providing for the creation of a court
responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose
decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of
Justice, is not, in principle, incompatible with EU law; that is
particularly the case where, as in this instance, the conclusion of
such an agreement is provided for by the Treaties themselves. The
competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its
capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the
power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or
designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and
application of their provisions (see Opinions 1/91, EU:C:1991:490,
paragraphs 40 and 70, and 1/09, EU:C:2011:123, paragraph 74).

Nevertheless, the Court of Justice has also declared that an
international agreement may affect its own powers only if the
indispensable conditions for safeguarding the essential character of
those powers are satisfied and, consequently, there is no adverse
effect on the autonomy of the EU legal order (see Opinions 1/00,
EU:C:2002:231, paragraphs 21, 23 and 26, and _ 1/09,
EU:C:2011:123, paragraph 76; see also, to that effect, judgment in
Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and
Commission, EU:C:2008:461, paragraph 282).

In particular, any action by the bodies given decision-making
powers by the ECHR, as provided for in the agreement envisaged,
must not have the effect of binding the EU and its institutions, in the
exercise of their internal powers, to a particular interpretation of the

148

493.

494.

tules of EU law (see Opinions 1/91, EU:C:1991:490, paragraphs 30

to 35, and 1/00, EU:C:2002:231, paragraph 13).6'5
The Tribunal will therefore (and in respectful disagreement with the tribunal in Masdar v
Spain®'®) assume that there is at least the possibility, and perhaps the probability,
particularly as a result of the citation of Ruling 1/09 on the EPC, and the use of the term
“international agreement” in the dispositif (by contrast with the term “bilateral investment
protection agreement” in the reference by the BGH) that if the compatibility of the ECT
with the TFEU arose before the CJEU, it would apply the Achmea ruling to the dispute

resolution mechanism under the ECT.

It is also necessary to mention three fundamental points about EU law. First, it has been
established for more than SO years that, from the viewpoint of EU law, that European Union
“constitutes a new legal order of international law for the benefit of which the states have
limited their sovereign rights, albeit within limited fields, and the subjects of which
comprise not only Member States but also their nationals.”°!” In Electrabel v Hungary, it
was said that EU law is international law because it is rooted in international treaties as
legal instruments under public international law; and EU law as a whole is part of the
international legal order, without any material distinction between the EU Treaties and the

“droit dérivé’, with the result that all EU legal rules are part of a regional system of
international law and therefore have an international legal character (citing Van Gend den
Loos).°'8 Like the tribunal in Vattenfall v Germany, this Tribunal considers that this
formula can be accepted on the basis that “the corpus of EU law derives from treaties that
are themselves a part of, and governed by, international law, and contains other rules that
are applicable on the plane of international law, while also containing rules that operate

only within the internal legal order of the EU and, at least arguably, are not a part of

615 Opinion 2/13 of the Court (Full Court) of 18 December 2014, pursuant to Article 218(11) TFEU (Accession of the
EU to the ECHR) (RL-0109), 9 182-184.

international law ...”°!° The tribunal in Vartenfall v Germany went on to say that since the
CJEU was empowered by the EU treaties to give preliminary rulings on the interpretation

of EU law, including the treaties, the Achmea ruling’s “interpretation of the EU Treaties

likewise [constituted] a part of the relevant international law’”.°°

But in the view of this Tribunal, the point that EU (or most of it) is international law, or
that the rulings of the CJEU are part of international law is not in any sense conclusive.
The question still remains as to whether EU law and the rulings of the CJEU are part of the

applicable international law.

The second point is that it has also been established for more than 50 years that it is a
fundamental principle of EU law that the EU has created its own legal system, which is an
integral part of the legal system of Member States and which their courts are bound
to apply.©!

The third point is that the system of references under what is now Article 267 TFEU is
designed to ensure the proper application and uniform interpretation of EU law in all the
Member States between national courts, in their capacity as courts responsible for the

application of EU law, and the CJEU.

Although phrased in terms of interpretation of two provisions of the TFEU, it is hard to
read the Achmea ruling as a normal case of treaty interpretation, since Article 267 is simply
the latest iteration (originally in Article 177 of the EEC Treaty) of the power (and in some
cases the duty) of national courts to make references to the Court of Justice, and Article 344
(originally Article 219 of the EEC Treaty) simply prevents Member States from submitting
disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of

settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties.

The residual remedy for a national of an EU Contracting State who wishes to complain of

a breach by another EU Contracting State of the relevant provisions of the ECT is to

commence an ICSID arbitration against that State. The only time at which national courts
will normally be engaged in this process is at the time of enforcement. It is impossible to
see how, on the face of Articles 267 and 344 TFEU, and in accordance with normal rules
of treaty interpretation, the effect of Article 26(3) ECT is to prevent national courts from
making references to the CJEU or to allow Member States to submit disputes concerning
the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those

provided for in the EU Treaties.

The Achmea ruling is a decision on the constitutional order of the EU in support of the
policy of European integration, rather than an orthodox application of the rules of treaty
interpretation. As such the ruling of the CJEU is entitled to the greatest respect from an
international arbitral tribunal. But such a tribunal is not in any sense bound by the ruling.
Nor, consequently, can the Tribunal find that, on any normal basis of interpretation under
customary international law codified in the VCLT, the dispute resolution provisions of the

ECT are incompatible with Articles 267 and 344 TFEU.

The Achmea ruling says that the agreement to arbitrate is precluded (paragraph 60 and the
dispositif), not that it is void, or incompatible with the TEC/TFEU, and consequently the
tuling leaves open the question of the effect of preclusion, and in particular whether its
effect is that any such provision ceased to have effect, or whether Member States should

modify or abrogate the BITs between them.

The Tribunal therefore comes to these conclusions:°”

(1) The Tribunal is “the judge of its own competence”: ICSID Convention, Article 41(1).

(2) The question of jurisdiction must be distinguished from the question of applicable

law, or choice of law. As indicated above, Article 42(1) provides that the “Tribunal

Its in other ECT cases have been in the same sense: Masdar v Spain; Eiser v Spain; Infrastructure Services

    

Luxembourg $.a.r.l. and Energia Termosolar B.V. (formerly Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.d.r.l. and

shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by

the parties.”

In the present case Article 26(6) ECT provides that the “tribunal established ... shall
decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and

principles of international law.”

The issues in dispute are those concerning alleged breaches of obligations under the
ECT relating to investments: Article 26(1) ECT. Accordingly, Article 42(1) of the
ICSID Convention and Article 26(6) of the ECT do not determine jurisdiction, and

are not relevant for present purposes.

By virtue of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention jurisdiction exists where (I) there
is a legal dispute which (2) arises directly out of an investment, (3) between a
Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, and (4) which the

parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.

By virtue of Article 26(1)-(3) of the ECT: (1) where there arise disputes between a
Contracting Party and an investor of another Contracting Party relating to an
investment of the latter in the area of the former, (2) which cannot be settled
amicably, (3) the investor party may submit it to ICSID arbitration, (4) if the
Contracting Party of the investor and the Contracting Party to the dispute are both

parties to the ICSID Convention.

There is plainly a dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent which arises
out of an investment in Spain, and the Contracting Parties of the investors,
Luxembourg and Sweden, are parties to the ECT and to the ICSID Convention, as is

the Respondent.

Accordingly the Respondent has given “its unconditional consent to the submission
of [the] dispute to international arbitration” (Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT), and the

Claimants have taken advantage of that consent.

For the reasons given above there is nothing in the combination of the ECT and

EU law which could give rise to an implication of a “disconnection” clause.

The EU itself is a separate party to the ECT.

There is no conflict between Article 26(1)-(3) of the ECT and Articles 267 and 344
of the TFEU such as to bring the principles codified in Article 30 VCLT into play.

It is therefore not necessary to decide whether the effect of Article 16 of the ECT is
that, even if there were an inconsistency between Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU
(and their predecessors) and the ECT, there would be no derogation from the dispute

resolution provisions in Part V of the ECT.

There is nothing in the Achmea ruling which could deprive a Tribunal so constituted
of jurisdiction. Neither it, nor the decisions which it cites on multilateral agreements,
suggest that Member States had no capacity to enter into agreements such as

the ECT.

The fact that the Tribunal, as a creature of international law, and not national law,
cannot make a reference to the CJEU, does not deprive it of jurisdiction under
international law. Nor can the plain meaning of the jurisdictional provisions of the
ECT and the ICSID Convention be affected by the CJEU’s interpretation of
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.

The declaration of the majority of the Member States of January 2019 is a political
declaration without legal force and does not affect the jurisdiction of the Tribunal;
and in particular, as a declaration by only some of the parties to the ECT it cannot,
for the purposes of the rules codified in Article 31 of the VCLT, be regarded as a
subsequent agreement between the parties regarding its interpretation or application,

or as practice establishing agreement.

The fact that EU law is international law for at least some purposes does not affect
the conclusion that, on the plain meaning of the ECT and the ICSID Convention, the
Tribunal has jurisdiction. It is true that EU law is international law because it is
rooted in international treaties, but it does not follow that all of EU law is
international law for all purposes, or that it will necessarily be the applicable law in

all circumstances.

153

505.

(17) The fact that EU law has primacy under the principle in Costa v ENEL does not affect
the position. The principle is concerned with primacy over national law and not
international law, whether customary law or treaty law. As the Opinion of the
Council Legal Service, quoted in the Declaration on which the Commission relies,
put it: “*... the law stemming from the Treaty, an independent source of law, could
not, because of its special and original nature, be overridden by domestic legal
provisions, however framed, without being deprived of its character as Community
law and without the legal basis of the Community itself being called into

an 7762.
question. 623

(18) It follows that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute.

(2) Jurisdiction: The Taxation Issue

a. The Legislation

As noted at paragraph 136 et seq. above, Act 15/2012 introduced a 7% tax on all revenue
received from the generation of electricity, whether from conventional or renewable
sources (the TVPEE), and a new provision imposing a new royalty (the Water Levy) on
hydropower concessionaires (i.e. hydropower producers) for using the inland public

hydraulic domain to produce electricity.

Of the 33 hydroelectric plants that are the subject of this arbitration, because of the
territorial limitation, the following 16 are affected by the Water Levy: 11 plants of the Xana
Portfolio: Villar del Rey, Pefia Corada, La Confianza, Alange, Quebradas, Tedelche,
Vicarias, Canal de Almazan, Jerte, Ferreras and Porma; and 5 plants of the Ondina

Portfolio: Castillonroy, Ponts, San Lorenzo, La Pobla (3 and 4) and Molinos.

b. The Parties’ Position in Summary

The arguments have been set out above. In summary, the Claimants’ case is that the

TVPEE and the Water Levy were unreasonable and discriminatory, represented a back-

door tariff cut to the RD 661/2007 regime, and were part of the New Regime in breach of
Article 10(1) of the ECT. In answer to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection based on
the tax carve-out in ECT, Article 21, the Claimants say that they were not bona fide taxes,
and that, even if they were bona fide, the effect of Article 21(5)(a) is that under Article 13,
for expropriation, taxes are not excluded (which is common ground) and that the effect of
Article 21(3) is that, as taxes which are “other than those on income and capital”, they

remain subject to the MEN clause in ECT, Article 10(7).

c. The Tax Carve-Out

ECT, Article 21 provides:

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this
Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to
Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of
any inconsistency between this Article and any other provision
of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the
inconsistency.

(3) Article 10(2) and (7) shall apply to Taxation Measures of the
Contracting Parties other than those on income or on capital,
except that such provisions shall not apply to:

(a) impose most favoured nation obligations with respect to
advantages accorded by a Contracting Party pursuant to the
tax provisions of any convention, agreement or arrangement
described in subparagraph (7)(a)(ii) or resulting from
membership of any Regional Economic Integration
Organization; ...

(5) (a) Article 13 shall apply to taxes.

(7) For the purposes of this Article:

(a) The term “Taxation Measure” includes:

155

(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a
local authority therein; and

(ii) any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the
avoidance of double taxation or of any other international
agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is
bound.

(b) There shall be regarded as taxes on income or on capital all
taxes imposed on total income, on total capital or on
elements of income or of capital, including taxes on gains
from the alienation of property, taxes on estates, inheritances
and gifts, or substantially similar taxes, taxes on the total
amounts of wages or salaries paid by enterprises, as well as
taxes on capital appreciation.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the terms “tax provisions” and
“taxes” do not include customs duties.

507. Article 21(3) refers to Article 10(2) and Article 10(7). Article 10(2), together with
Article 10(3), imposes an obligation on Contracting Parties to endeavour to accord to
investors of other Contracting Parties treatment which is no less favourable than that which
they accord to their own investors or to investors of any other Contracting Party or any

third state, whichever is the most favourable.
508. Article 10(7) provides:

Each Contracting Party shall accord to Investments in its Area of
Investors of other Contracting Parties, and their related activities
including management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal,
treatment no less favourable than that which it accords to
Investments of its own Investors or of the Investors of any other
Contracting Party or any third state and their related activities
including management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal,
whichever is the most favourable.

d. Are the TVPEE and the Water Levy “Taxation Measures”?

509. Article 21 does not contain a comprehensive definition of “Taxation Measures”, although

Article 21(7)(a) does indicate that they include any provision relating to taxes of the

156

510.

S11.

512.

513.

domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a political subdivision or local authority; and
any provision relating to taxes of any convention for the avoidance of double taxation or
of any other international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting Party is
bound. Article 21(7) gives a (probably non-exhaustive) list of measures to be regarded as
taxes on income or capital for the purposes of (inter alia) Article 21(3),and excludes

customs duties.

Article 21 of the ECT as a whole must be interpreted in accordance with the principles of
customary international law codified in the VCLT, in particular the general rule of treaty
interpretation in Article 31, which provides that “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith
in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their

context and in the light of its object and purpose.”

In order to ascertain whether a measure qualifies as a taxation measure under Article 21 it
is first necessary to consider the characterisation of the measure in the State’s domestic
law. In order for Article 21 to apply, the domestic law of the host State must characterise
the measure as a tax in nature and substance. That is clear from several references in
Article 21 to taxation measures of the Contracting Parties (e.g. Article 21(1), (3)) or “taxes

of the domestic law of the Contracting Party” (Article 21(7)(a)(i)).

But simply describing a measure as a tax is not sufficient. Article 21(7) provides that the
term “Taxation Measure” includes “any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of
the Contracting Party.” But even if a measure is characterised as a tax by national law, the
characterisation by domestic law is not conclusive for the purposes of international law. In
the view of the Tribunal, to qualify as a taxation measure, the measure must be both a tax
under national law and also under the ECT. In the absence of a comprehensive definition

in the ECT, resort must be had to international arbitral decisions.

There is no doubt that the measures are regarded as taxation measures under Spanish
law. Act 15/2012 described itself as relating to “fiscal measures” and Act 17/2012 on the
Budget for 2013 provided that the taxes raised under Act 15/2012 should be assigned to

finance the costs of the promotion of renewable energy in the electricity system under the

157

Electricity Act 54/1997. In deciding that the legislation on TVPEE was justified by an
extraordinary and urgent need to make cost adjustments in the electricity sector and was
compliant with the Spanish Constitution, the Constitutional Court proceeded on the basis
that it was a tax in its decision of 6 November 2014,° as did several decisions of the

Spanish High Court in June 2014.7

514. International arbitral practice indicates that for the purpose of the interpretation of the
carve-out taxation in investment treaties, the following factors are relevant: (1) that it is
imposed by law and is part of a regime for the imposition of a tax; and (2) that it imposes

a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes.°**

515. In view of what is said above, there is no doubt that on its face the TVPEE and Water Levy
were imposed by law and were part of the taxation regime in Spain, and imposed a liability

on classes of persons to pay them for public purposes.

516. Nevertheless, even if a measure is prima facie a taxation measure, it may be outside the
carve-out if it is called a taxation measure but is imposed in bad faith for other reasons. In

such a case a tribunal would look beyond the form of the measure and consider the reality.
517. In Yukos v Russia® the tribunal said:

...the Tribunal finds that, in any event, the carve-out of Article 21(1)
can apply only to bona fide taxation actions, i.e., actions that are
motivated by the purpose of raising general revenue for the State.
By contrast, actions that are taken only under the guise of taxation,
but in reality aim to achieve an entirely unrelated purpose (such as
the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political

opponent) cannot qualify for exemption from the protection
standards of the ECT under the taxation carve-out in Article 21(1).

To find otherwise would mean that the mere labelling of a measure
as “taxation” would be sufficient to bring such measure within the
ambit of Article 21(1) of the ECT, and produce a loophole in the
protective scope of the ECT. Since the claw-back in Article 21(5)
of the ECT relates only to expropriations under Article 13 of the
ECT, a State could, simply by labelling a measure as “taxation”,
effectively avoid the control of that measure under the ECT’s other
protection standards. It would seem difficult to reconcile such an
interpretation with the purpose of Part III of the ECT.

Thus, the RosInvestCo tribunal concluded that:

[I]t is generally accepted that the mere fact that measures by
a host state are taken in the form of application and
enforcement of its tax law, does not prevent a tribunal from
examining whether this conduct of the host state must be
considered, under the applicable BIT or other international
treaties on investment protection, as an abuse of tax law to
in fact enact an expropriation.°”

Similarly, the Quasar tribunal opined that:

It is no answer for a state to say that its courts have used the
word “taxation” ... in describing judgments by which they
effect the dispossession of foreign investors. If that were
enough, investment protection through international law
would likely become an illusion, as states would quickly
learn to avoid responsibility by dressing up all adverse
measures, perhaps expropriation first of all, as
taxation. When agreeing to the jurisdiction of international
tribunals, states perforce accept that those jurisdictions will
exercise their judgment, and not be stumped by the use
of labels.*!

521.

But it is for a claimant to meet what must be the heavy burden of showing bad faith. It
would be a serious matter for a tribunal to find that the exercise of the sovereign power to
tax was exercised in bad faith. The Claimants say that the measures were taxation measures
“in name only”®? because they were thinly disguised retroactive cuts to the RD 661/2007
regime and because the revenues were to be spent on financing the electricity system. But
there is no evidential basis put forward to show that the TVPEE and the Water Levy had
any illegitimate ulterior purpose. Consequently, it does not require any elaboration for the
Tribunal to conclude that the Claimants have not established that the Respondent used the
taxation power for an ulterior purpose. The stated, and actual, purpose was to raise revenue
for the electricity system and create a balanced budget. A tax does not cease to be a tax

because there is a mandatory allocation of revenues received from the taxation measure.

The final question is whether the effect of Article 21(3) is to allow the application of
Article 10(7), the MFN clause. Article 21(3) provides that Article 10(7) (and also the
national treatment provision in Article 10(2)) shall apply to taxation measures, but not to
taxation measures on “income or on capital.” Article 21(7)(b) provides: “There shall be
regarded as taxes on income or on capital all taxes imposed on total income, on total capital

or on elements of income or of capital.”

The Claimants’ argument is that the essence of this definition is that taxes on income or
capital are those imposed on “total income” or “total capital” or on “elements of” either
income or capital. The TVPEE and the Water Levy are not imposed on either total income
or total capital, or elements of capital, but on gross revenues; and they rely on the OECD
Model Tax Convention, and commentaries on it, to suggest that the ECT should likewise

be interpreted to use income in the sense of gross revenues minus deductible expenses.°*

The Tribunal is satisfied that this argument fails. First, there is nothing in Article 21(3) or
Article 21(7)(b) to suggest that the exclusion is limited to taxes on net income. Second,

Article 27(1)(b) refers also to “total income ... or ... elements of income” which suggests

© Rey. Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 61:1 (Ms Martinez Lopez).
3 Cl, Reply, 1 426 et seq.

160

that it extends beyond net income. Third, although it is of course by no means conclusive,
the Energy Charter Secretariat takes the view that the purpose of the provision is to exclude

indirect taxes, which plainly the TVPEE and Water Levy are not.°*

522. Consequently, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to consider the Claimants’ claims in relation
to the TVPEE and Water Levy, other than expropriation claims under ECT, Article 13, and

only then under the conditions in ECT, Article 21(5).

E. The Expropriation Claim

(1) Article 13(1) of the ECT

523. By Article 13(1) of the ECT:

Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any
other Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or
subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to
nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as
“Expropriation”) except where such Expropriation is:

(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;
(b) not discriminatory;
(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation.

Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the
Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the
Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such a
way as to affect the value of the Investment...

524. By Article 1(6):

“Investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled
directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:

© The Energy Charter Treaty. A Reader’s Guide (RL-0053), p 39.

161

(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property,
and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and
pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other
forms of equity participation in a company or business
enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business
enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract
having an economic value and associated with an Investment;

(d) Intellectual Property;
(e) Returns;

(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any
licences and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any
Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.

A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect
their character as investments and the term “Investment” includes
all investments, whether existing at or made after the later of the
date of entry into force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party of
the Investor making the investment and that for the Contracting
Party in the Area of which the investment is made (hereinafter
referred to as the “Effective Date”) provided that the Treaty shall
only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective
Date.

525. The Claimants’ case is that the disputed measures amount to indirect and/or creeping

expropriation.

526. They also claim that the TVPEE and the Water Levy form part of a series of
measures constituting a creeping expropriation of the Claimants’ investments in breach of
Article 13 ECT for this purpose.**> It is common ground that there is no jurisdictional
issue concerning this claim because the effect of Article 21(5)(a) is that the tax carve-out
provisions of Article 21 do not apply to expropriation claims even if they are bona fide

taxation measures.®° The Claimants say that the procedural provisions of Article 21(5)(b)

requiring referral to the competent tax authority whenever an issue arises under Article 13,
to the extent it pertains to whether a tax constitutes an expropriation or whether a tax
alleged to constitute an expropriation is discriminatory do not apply, according to the
Claimants, because (a) they are not bona fide taxation measures; and (b) in any event, form
only a part of a series of Spain’s measures leading to a creeping expropriation of Claimants’
investments (i.e. it is not the Claimants’ position that these two measures by themselves
result in an expropriation). But without prejudice to the Claimants’ position that such a
referral is not required, the Claimants have made such a referral to the Competent Tax

Authority in Spain.°*”
There is no substantial dispute concerning the basic principles underlying Article 13(1).

First, for a taking to be lawful, each of the conditions of (a) public purpose; (b) non-

discrimination; (c) due process of law; and (d) compensation must be satisfied.°*

Second, it applies expressly to indirect expropriation by virtue of the reference to
“measures having an effect equivalent to ... expropriation”, and indirect expropriation may
take the form of “creeping expropriation”, i.e. a “specific form of expropriation that results
from a series of measures taken over time that cumulatively have an expropriatory effect,

rather than from a single measure or group of measures that occur at one time.”®?

Third, indirect expropriation has been described in a number of different ways, but all with

essentially the same effect, namely that the contested measures:

(1) | Irreversibly and permanently deprive the owner of property of the effective use of the

asset, even where legal ownership is not affected, and the form of the deprivation

measure is less important than its actual effects:°° or

significant or substantial depreciation in value of the asset amounts to indirect
expropriation may go too far, or must be read in a particular factual context, and that the
true test is whether the measures involve a “substantially complete deprivation of the
economic use and enjoyment of the rights to the investment, or of identifiable, distinct parts

thereof (i.e., approaching total impairment) ...”°>?

Sixth, regulatory measures can constitute indirect expropriation.** This is so where the
negative economic impact of such actions on the financial position of the investor is
sufficient to neutralize in full the value, or economic or commercial use of its investment

without the receipt of any compensation.

Seventh, a State is not required to compensate an investment for any loss sustained by the
imposition of a non-discriminatory, regulatory measure designed and applied to protect

legitimate public welfare objectives.°>

(2) The Tribunal’s Conclusion

What the Claimants say is that Spain has effected an indirect, creeping expropriation of
their investments. They say:°° (1) Spain’s measures have wiped out completely the fair
market value of the Claimants’ equity investments as of 30 September 2016, and the value
of their debt investments was reduced by around 85.3% as of the same date; (2) market
prices received by the small-hydro installations for their electricity are insufficient for the
installations to service project financing debt obligations and to generate a return on the
Claimants’ equity and debt investments; (3) the economic benefits of these investments
have therefore disappeared, and those investments have thus been rendered essentially
worthless; (4) Spain’s measures have reduced the fair market value of the Claimants’ equity

investments to EUR 19 million, and the value of their debt investments to

EUR 1.8 million;®’ (5) the Claimants have also been deprived of EUR 13.3 million in
historical cash flows from | January 2013; and (6) the Claimants have been permanently
deprived of the fundamental investment rights that enabled them to expect a reasonable

economic benefit from their investment.

As the above account of the relevant principles establishes, regulatory measures can
amount to indirect expropriation, but if they are to amount to indirect expropriation there
must be substantial deprivation, i.e. the loss of all significant economic value through the
loss of at least one of the constitutive attributes of ownership, such that the loss of value is
such that it could be considered equivalent to a deprivation of property, and the loss of
attributes of ownership. A mere loss in value of an investment, unless the loss of value is
such that it could be considered equivalent to a deprivation of the investment, is

not sufficient.

The Spanish measures were not intended to expropriate the Claimants’ assets nor did they
have that effect. The Claimants have not sought to establish that they were deprived of
their investment, because they are not in a position to do so. They still hold the shares in
the companies and the plants are still operating, albeit that there may have been a

substantial reduction in their value.

In these circumstances the Tribunal rejects the expropriation claim.

F. Article 10(1) of the ECT: Principles
By Article 10(1) of the ECT:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of
other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such
Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection
and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management,

maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall
such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than
that required by international law, including treaty obligations.
Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered
into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other
Contracting Party.

(1) General Considerations

a. Interpretation

As indicated above, the ECT standards are to be interpreted in accordance with the
principles of customary international law codified in the VCLT, including its reference in
Article 31(3)(c) to general international law,°* and against the background of the purposes

of the ECT.

Under the heading “Purpose of the Treaty” Article 2 of the ECT provides: “This Treaty
establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation in the energy
field, based on complementarities and mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives

and principles of the Charter.”

The Concluding Document of the Hague Conference on the European Energy Charter of
17 December 1991 recognised in its preamble “State sovereignty and sovereign rights over
energy resources” and “the role of entrepreneurs, operating within a transparent and
equitable legal framework, in promoting co-operation under the Charter.” Under the

heading “Promotion and protection of investments” the Charter provided:°?

In order to promote the international flow of investments, the
signatories will at national level provide for a stable, transparent
legal framework for foreign investments, in conformity with the
relevant international laws and rules on investment and trade.

They affirm that it is important for the signatory States to negotiate
and ratify legally binding agreements on promotion and protection

of investments which ensure a high level of legal security and enable

the use of investment risk guarantee schemes.°°
Consequently, the Tribunal approaches the ECT with due regard to its purpose of
establishing a legal framework in order to promote long-term cooperation,®! but also
balancing State sovereignty and the State’s responsibility to create an adapted and
evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities and the necessity to

protect foreign investment and its continuing flow.%

b. The Article 10(1) Obligations

Article 10(1) contains, so far as is relevant, the following principal obligations on the
Contracting Parties: (1) to encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for investors, including a commitment to accord fair and equitable
treatment; (2) to afford “the most constant protection and security” to investments; and
(3) not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the maintenance, use, or
enjoyment of investments. Other obligations in Article 10(1) such as the obligation to
afford at least the treatment standards required by international law, and to observe any
obligations entered into with an investor (the umbrella clause), have not played any

significant role in this arbitration.

Comprehensive analysis of the various obligations in Article 10(1) and their interaction
with each other is not necessary since the Parties have in these proceedings concentrated
on the core (and overlapping) obligations of (1) fair and equitable treatment, including
aspects of stability and transparency, and the implied or inherent obligation of respect for
legitimate expectations; (2) constant protection and security; and (3) impairment by

unreasonable or discriminatory treatment.

550.

It is apparent from the many awards in relation to the ECT and BITs that these obligations
overlap to a very great degree, and it is not necessary to undertake a minute examination

of the differences between them.

(i) The obligation to “create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions”
On the face of Article 10(1) there is a separate obligation to “create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions”, which includes a “commitment to accord at all

times ... fair and equitable treatment.”

It is, however, clear that even without an express obligation to create stable, equitable and
transparent conditions, that such an obligation would be included in the fair and equitable
treatment standard (FET), and that, no doubt, was what the tribunal in Plama v Bulgaria’?
meant when it said that “stable and equitable conditions are clearly part of the fair and

equitable treatment standard under the ECT.”

But some tribunals have taken this (wrongly in the view of this Tribunal) to mean “that the
stability and transparency obligation is simply an illustration of the obligation to respect
the investor’s legitimate expectations through the FET standard, rather than a separate or
independent obligation.”** But nothing turns on the point in this arbitration because it is

clear that stability and transparency are also part of the FET standard itself.

(ii) “... commitment to accord at all times ... fair and equitable treatment”

 

There are many awards which emphasise that protection of legitimate expectations is the

dominant element, or the most important element, of the FET standard. But before

the principles relating to legitimate expectation are set out, it is necessary to say something

about the State’s other obligations involved in FET, or connected by the ECT with it.

These elements are stability and transparency, the obligation to provide most constant
protection and security, reasonableness and non-discrimination, due process and

non-retroactivity.

(iii) Stability and transparency

As indicated above, stability and transparency are included in the express obligation in
Article 10(1) for the State to “create stable ... and transparent conditions” and are also
implicit in the obligation to accord FET, and stability is also part of the legitimate

expectation of the investor.

(iv) Meaning of stability

Stability is linked to the investor’s legitimate expectations that the legal framework will
not be arbitrarily changed and that commitments will be observed. But it does not mean
that an investor is protected from any change. The obligation has a relatively high

threshold, and the emphasis is on the subversion of the legal regime.”
The tribunal in Frontier v Czech Republic said:

Stability means that the investor’s legitimate expectations based on
this legal framework and on any undertakings and representations
made explicitly or implicitly by the host state will be protected. The
investor may rely on that legal framework as well as on
representations and undertakings made by the host state including
those in legislation, treaties, decrees, licenses, and contracts.
Consequently, an arbitrary reversal of such undertakings will
constitute a violation of fair and equitable treatment. While the host
state is entitled to determine its legal and economic order, the
investor also has a legitimate expectation in the system’s stability to
facilitate rational planning and decision making.°*

conditions does not mean that a State does not maintain its legitimate right to regulate.

In AES v Hungary the tribunal said:

The stable conditions that the ECT mentions relate to the framework
within which the investment takes place. Nevertheless, it is not a
stability clause. A legal framework is by definition subject to
change as it adapts to new circumstances day by day and a state
has the sovereign right to exercise its powers which include
legislative acts.

Therefore, to determine the scope of the stable conditions that a state
has to encourage and create is a complex task given that it will
always depend on the specific circumstances that surrounds [sic] the
investor’s decision to invest and the measures taken by the state in
the public interest.°”

The State’s right to regulate and its limits will be developed below.

(v) Transparency

But there are limits to the use of the concept of stability. The duty to provide stable

669

Transparency is plainly linked with stability. Transparency will enable the investor to be

shielded from arbitrary change and from the frustration of legitimate expectations.

In the context of the ECT, in Electrabel v Hungary the tribunal said:

Article 10(1) ECT not only speaks of fair and equitable treatment
and equitable and stable conditions, it also refers to “favourable and
transparent conditions.” The reference to transparency can be read
to indicate an obligation to be forthcoming with information about
intended changes in policy and regulations that may significantly
affect investments, so that the investor can adequately plan its
investment and, if needed, engage the host State in dialogue about
protecting its legitimate expectations. ..°7!

(vi) “... shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security...”

559. Article 10(1) of the ECT provides that investments shall “enjoy the most constant
protection and security”. This provision is similar to, and perhaps stronger than, the
commonly used language in investment treaties that obliges host States to provide “full
protection and security” to investments, but there is no reason to suppose that they will lead

to a different result in practice in any case.°”*

560. There are two views of the “protection and security” obligation, whether or not it is

characterised as “constant” or “full”.

561. The first view is that it is simply reflective of the traditional duty of the State in public
international law to protect property of aliens from interference by third parties or

(sometimes) State actors.°”* This view is exemplified by Electrabel v Hungary, in which

the tribunal said°” (approving the award in the El Paso v Argentina case®”’):

... The second part of Article 10(1) ECT requires Hungary to ensure
that all covered investments “shall also enjoy the most constant
protection and security”. The FET standard and this FPS standard
are two distinct standards of protection under the ECT, dealing with
two different types of protection for foreign investors.

In the Tribunal’s view, given that there are two distinct standards
under the ECT, they must have, by application of the legal principle
of “effet utile”, a different scope and role. The Tribunal generally
concurs with the description given by the E/ Paso award of the scope
of an FPS standard, as follows:

“The case-law and commentators generally agree that this
standard imposes an obligation of vigilance and due
diligence upon the government. ... The minimum standard of
vigilance and care set by international law comprises a duty
of prevention and a duty of repression. A well-established

aspect of the international standard of treatment is that
States must use “due diligence” to prevent wrongful injuries
to the person or property of aliens caused by third parties
within their territory, and, if they did not succeed, exercise
at least “due diligence” to punish such injuries. If a State
fails to exercise due diligence to prevent or punish such
injuries, it is responsible for this omission and is liable for
the ensuing damage. It should be emphasised that the
obligation to show “due diligence” does not mean that the
State has to prevent each and every injury.”

In Saluka v Czech Republic the tribunal said that “... the standard obliges the host State to
adopt all reasonable measures to protect assets and property from threats or attacks which
may target particularly foreigners or certain groups of foreigners. The practice of arbitral
tribunals seems to indicate, however, that the ‘full security and protection’ clause is not
meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an investor’s investment, but to protect more

specifically the physical integrity of an investment against interference by use of force.”°”°

The other view is that the duty to afford full or most constant protection and security also
extends to a duty to provide a legal framework which provides legal security.
In Siemens v Argentina, the tribunal defined legal security as “the quality of the legal

system which implies certainty in its norms and, consequently, their foreseeable

9677

application’ and in Vivendi v Argentina the tribunal said that it:

should be interpreted to apply to reach any act or measure which
deprives an investor’s investment of protection and full security,
providing, in accordance with the Treaty’s specific wording, the act
or measure also constitutes unfair and inequitable treatment. Such
actions or measures need not threaten physical possession or the
legally protected terms of operation of the investment.°”®

This approach is exemplified by the award in AES v Hungary, in which the tribunal said:
In the Tribunal’s view, the duty to provide most constant protection

and security to investments is a state’s obligation to take reasonable
steps to protect its investors (or to enable its investors to protect

themselves) against harassment by third parties and/or state actors.
But the standard is certainly not one of strict liability. And while it
can, in appropriate circumstances, extend beyond a protection of
physical security, it certainly does not protect against a state’s right
(as was the case here) to legislate or regulate in a manner which may
negatively affect a claimant’s investment, provided that the state
acts reasonably in the circumstances and with a view to achieving
objectively rational public policy goals.°”

565. On this view the full or most constant protection and security standard encompasses a
“guarantee of stability in a secure environment, both physical, commercial and legal’”®*° or
“stability afforded by a secure investment environment.”®*! But as the tribunal in Plama v
Bulgaria recognised, to include protection concerning legal security under this head means
that “the standard becomes closely connected with the notion of fair and equitable
treatment.”°*? Consequently, when the tribunal in Azurix v Argentina found that a failure
to provide a secure investment environment was a failure to afford fair and equitable
treatment, it “finds that the Respondent also breached the standard of full protection
and security.”°*>

566. In the present case, there is no allegation of failure to provide constant protection and
security in the traditional sense of protection against third parties, and since in the wider
sense it adds little or nothing to the FET standard, it is not necessary to say more than on
the normal reading of the expression, against the background of customary international
law and the practice of modern tribunals, the former view is correct and that it connotes an

obligation which is distinct from FET.

(vii) “shall [not] in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
measures”
The obligation not to impair investments by unreasonable or discriminatory measures
appears as a free-standing obligation, but there is no doubt that the FET standard contains

the same obligation.

Regulatory measures must be proportionate, non-arbitrary, and non-discriminatory.°*
Consequently, in the absence of a specific commitment, the State has no obligation to grant
subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they
are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a
manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should
have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed

substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.

Reasonableness means that “the State’s conduct bears a reasonable relationship to
some rational policy.”°*° But that alone is not sufficient. In Micula v Romania the

tribunal said:

... for a state’s conduct to be reasonable, it is not sufficient that it be
related to a rational policy; it is also necessary that, in the
implementation of that policy, the state’s acts have been
appropriately tailored to the pursuit of that rational policy with due
regard for the consequences imposed on investors.°*”

570. But the criterion of “unreasonableness” is not to be used as an open-ended mandate to

second-guess the host State’s policies.°*

571. In EDF v Romania,®® the tribunal adopted Dr Schreuer’s criteria in the context of
“unreasonable or discriminatory measures”: (a) a measure that inflicts damage on the
investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose; (b) a measure that is not based
on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference; (c) a measure taken
for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker; and (d) a

measure taken in wilful disregard of due process and proper procedure.
572. In AES v Hungary the tribunal said:

There are two elements that require to be analyzed to determine
whether a state’s act was unreasonable: the existence of a rational
policy; and the reasonableness of the act of the state in relation to
the policy.

A rational policy is taken by a state following a logical (good sense)
explanation and with the aim of addressing a public interest matter.

Nevertheless, a rational policy is not enough to justify all the
measures taken by a state in its name. A challenged measure must
also be reasonable. That is, there needs to be an appropriate
correlation between the state’s public policy objective and the
measure adopted to achieve it. This has to do with the nature of the
measure and the way it is implemented.°”

c. Proportionality

573. The requirement of proportionality is part of the reasonableness standard and of the fair

and equitable treatment standard.©!

574. A measure must be suitable to achieve a legitimate policy objective, necessary for that

objective, and not excessive considering the relative weight of each interest involved, and

a balancing or weighing exercise so as to ensure that the effects of the intended measure

remain proportionate with regard to the affected rights and interests.”

d. Due Process

“Procedural propriety and due process” are part of the FET standard, both in relation to
judicial and administrative action. But they are intimately linked with transparency in the
sense that in the legislative process, as distinct from the juridical process, where they play
a much greater role, they are relevant mainly to the Claimants’ complaint®? that in breach
of the Respondent’s obligation to act transparently, and in accordance with due process,°*
the disputed measures were enacted using Spain’s emergency Royal Decree law process,

thereby restricting consultation and input from affected parties such as the Claimants.

The Respondent does not deny that due process is required. It says that all the measures

were published and hearings were held about them.>

e. Non-Discrimination

“Non-discrimination” requires a rational justification of any differential treatment. For a
measure to be discriminatory two similar situations are objectively treated differently,

without objective justification. °°

f. Retroactivity

There is no general principle which prohibits the retroactivity of legislation, but it may,
depending on the context, be relevant to unreasonableness, breach of legitimate expectation

or destruction of acquired rights.

g. Legitimate Expectations
(i) The Relevant Time

An investor’s legitimate expectations must be assessed as at the time of the investment.°”

(ii) Legitimate Expectation and the Right to Regulate

In this context, legitimate expectation means a legally protected expectation. It is not
synonymous with a reasonable business judgment. It is in the nature of businesses to take
decisions or risks on the basis of the facts known to them and their reasonable predictions

about the future. Not every such decision is legally protected.

A very extensive review of arbitral practice enables the following propositions (some of

which overlap with each other) to be extracted from the many awards cited to this Tribunal.

First, the State’s sovereign right to regulate has been affirmed in many awards, and the

698 and the requirements of legitimate

State is entitled to a “high measure of deference,
expectations and legal stability as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the
State’s rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal system to

changing circumstances.”

Second, the idea that legitimate expectations, and therefore FET, imply the stability of the
legal and business framework does not mean the virtual freezing of the legal regulation of
economic activities.” There has to be a weighing of an investor’s expectations and the

State’s regulatory interests.”!

Third, in the absence of specific promises or representations by the State to the investor,
the investor may not rely on an investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the

risk of any changes in the host State’s legal and economic framework. ”°

Fourth, it has been said that it is inconceivable a State would make a general commitment
never to change its legislation whatever the circumstances, and it would be unreasonable
for an investor to rely on such a freeze,” in particular where times and needs change, or

where crisis arises.

Fifth, general laws are not promises, and the risk of change is for entrepreneurs to assess

and assume. ”°4

Sixth, economic, social, environmental and legal circumstances and problems are by
their nature evolutionary, dynamic and bound to constant change, and it is indispensable
for successful public infrastructure and public services to be adaptable to change in

evolving circumstances.’

Seventh, consequently, the FET standard preserves the regulatory authority of the host
State to make and change its laws and regulations to adapt to changing needs, including

fiscal needs, subject to respect for specific commitments made.7°

Eighth, the expression “margin of appreciation” can be used to convey the point
that the State’s right to regulate is subject to a wide latitude, subject to its compliance
with its duties under the ECT and customary international law. As the tribunal in

Electrabel v Hungary said:

Regulatory pricing (by operation of law) was and remains an
important measure available to State regulators in liberalised
markets for electricity. It is, even at best, a difficult discretionary
exercise involving many complex factors. In short, Hungary would

enjoy a reasonable margin of appreciation in taking such measures
before being held to account under the ECT’s standards of
protection.”””

590. Ninth, consequently changes to general legislation (at least in the absence of a stabilization
clause) are not prevented by the FET standard if they do not exceed the acceptable margin
of change in the exercise of the host State’s normal regulatory power in pursuance of a

public interest. In Philip Morris v Uruguay the tribunal said:

It is common ground in the decisions of more recent investment
tribunals that the requirements of legitimate expectations and legal
stability as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the
State’s rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to
adapt its legal system to changing circumstances.

On this basis, changes to general legislation (at least in the absence
of a stabilization clause) are not prevented by the fair and equitable
treatment standard if they do not exceed the exercise of the host
State’s normal regulatory power in the pursuance of a public interest
and do not modify the regulatory framework relied upon by the
investor at the time of its investment “outside of the acceptable
margin of change.’

(iii) Basic principles and the importance of commitments by the State

591. Most of these principles appear from the award in Micula v Romania:

...the fair and equitable treatment standard does not give a right to
regulatory stability per se. The state has a right to regulate, and
investors must expect that the legislation will change, absent a
stabilization clause or other specific assurance giving rise to a
legitimate expectation of stability.

The Parties agree that, in order to establish a breach of the fair and
equitable treatment obligation based on an allegation that Romania
undermined the Claimants’ legitimate expectations, the Claimants
must establish that (a) Romania made a promise or assurance, (b) the

27 Electrabel v Hungary Decision, {| 8.35; also Philip Morris v Uruguay, 399; RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited

Claimants relied on that promise or assurance as a matter of fact,
and (c) such reliance (and expectation) was reasonable. This test is
consistent with the elements considered by other international
tribunals.

This promise, assurance or representation may have been issued
generally or specifically, but it must have created a specific and
reasonable expectation in the investor. That is not to say that a
subjective expectation will suffice; that subjective expectation must
also have been objectively reasonable. As stated by the Saluka
tribunal, “the scope of the Treaty’s protection of foreign investment
against unfair and inequitable treatment cannot exclusively be
determined by foreign investors’ subjective motivations and
considerations. Their expectations, in order for them to be
protected, must rise to the level of legitimacy and reasonableness in
light of the circumstances.”

The Claimants must also have relied on that expectation when they
made their investments. However, it is not necessary for the entire
investment to have been predicated solely on such expectation.
Businessmen do not invest on the basis of one single consideration,
no matter how important. In the Tribunal’s view, that expectation
must be a determining factor in an investor’s decision to invest, or
in the manner or magnitude of its investments.

When the alleged legitimate expectation is one of regulatory
stability, the reasonableness of the expectation must take into
account the underlying presumption that, absent an assurance to the
contrary, a state cannot be expected to freeze its laws and
regulations...’

h. Commitments

592. The same or similar points are made in many other awards, often subject to the
same important proviso that a change in the law may be a breach of an investor’s legitimate
expectation if a specific commitment has been made not to change the regulatory

framework.

593. In the context of the ECT, in Plama v Bulgaria’ the tribunal made it clear that the ECT
did not protect investors against any and all changes in the host country’s laws. Under the
FET standard the investor was only protected if (at least) reasonable and justifiable
expectations were created in that regard by the State’s promises or other representations to

the investor to freeze its legislation on environmental law.

594. Usually general texts cannot contain such commitments, as there is no guarantee that they

will not be modified in due course. In Blusun v Italy the tribunal said:

... a representation as to future conduct of the state could be made
in the form of a law, sufficiently clearly expressed. But there is still
a clear distinction between a law, i.e. a norm of greater or lesser
generality creating rights and obligations while it remains in force,
and a promise or contractual commitment. There is a further
distinction between contractual commitments and expectations
underlying a given relationship: however legitimate, the latter are
more matters to be taken into account in applying other norms than
they are norms in their own right. International law does not make
binding that which was not binding in the first place, nor render
perpetual what was temporary only.7!!

595. In Philip Morris v Uruguay the tribunal said:

It clearly emerges from the analysis of the FET standard by
investment tribunals that legitimate expectations depend on specific
undertakings and representations made by the host State to
induce investors to make an investment. Provisions of general
legislation applicable to a plurality of persons or of category of
persons, do not create legitimate expectations that there will be no
change in the law.7!

596. But it has been said7!* that legitimate expectations may be engendered by the

legal framework at the time of the investment, especially if there has been “‘a reiteration of

the same type of commitment in different types of general statements,”’!* but this may

properly be regarded as an aspect of stability rather than as an example of a specific

commitment.

i. Authority

If the assurance is given informally by a State official, it is necessary to see if statements
have the necessary clarity, and to ensure that the person making the representation has the

appropriate authority to give undertakings binding on the State.”!>

Normally an entity of the State not vested with actual decision-making authority cannot be

taken to bind the entity which by law possesses the actual authority.’!°

j- Due Diligence

Fairness and consistency must be assessed against the background of information that the
investor knew and should reasonably have known at the time of the investment and of the

conduct of the host State.”!7

Consequently, given the State’s regulatory powers, in order to rely on legitimate
expectations, the investor should inquire in advance regarding the prospects of a change in
the regulatory framework in light of the then prevailing or reasonably to be expected

changes in the economic and social conditions of the host State.’!*

It follows that it is therefore important to assess the investor’s due diligence exercise when
it made the investment, and in particular whether, for example, (J) the investor investigated
or took advice on the host State’s applicable law;’! and (2) whether it took care that any

official statements on which it relied could reasonably be attributed to the State.’”°

(2) Whether There was a Legislative Commitment in RD 661/2007 on which
the Claimants were Entitled to Rely; the Relevance of the Decisions of the
Spanish Supreme Court; the Claimants’ Legal Advice; and the 2010

Changes
At the risk of over-simplification, the Claimants say that: RD 661/2007 amounted to
a specific legislative commitment that any changes to the regime would not affect existing
installations; they were entitled to rely on that commitment at the time of their investment;
and there was nothing in the decisions of the Spanish Supreme Court which would have

put them on notice that RD 661/2007, Article 44(3) could be rendered inoperative. ’!

It should be emphasised that the Claimants also say that, even if there was no such general
commitment, there was nevertheless a commitment, and therefore a legitimate expectation,

that any such change would not affect small-hydro.

It is important at the outset to emphasise that this is not purely a matter of Spanish law.
Whether there was a commitment which could give rise to a legitimate expectation is in
the first instance a question of international law. But in considering whether there was
such a commitment and whether it was reasonable to rely on it, it is necessary to look at it
in the context of Spanish law, and the advice which an investor took or should have taken

on the nature of the commitment if any.

a. The Claimants’ Position

To recapitulate what has been said above, 722

the case put in the Claimants’ Memorial was
that the rights granted by RD 661/2007 amounted to a commitment (or, as it is sometimes
said, a guarantee’?*) that small-hydro plants (a) could sell all of their electricity output;
(b) at either a regulated tariff or a premium on the market price; (c) for pre-established
amounts revised yearly for inflation; (d) for the plants’ entire operational lifetime; and

(e) free from any future downward reviews or alterations to the specified feed-in

remuneration rates or term. The Claimants say that Article 44(3) made it clear that any
revisions stemming from these reviews would not apply to existing installations.”"* Article
44(3) expressly stipulated that revisions of the feed-in remuneration in RD 661/2007 would
occur every four years, beginning in 2010. However, by contrast with the Article 44(1)
inflation-based update which was to apply to all facilities regardless of their commissioning
date, Article 44(3) expressly stipulated that the envisaged revisions would not apply to
existing plants or plants then under development that were commissioned by January of
the second year following the revision. A revision conducted in 2010 could not affect
existing installations or any installations that were commissioned by January 2012.
If Article 44(3) had intended to preserve the scope for Spain to make other “unplanned
revisions” to the feed-in remuneration for existing facilities regardless of their

commissioning date, it would have said so expressly (as in Article 44(1)).

606. The Claimants also rely on a press release from the Ministry of Energy of 25 May 2007
issued on enactment of RD 661/2007, which stated: “Any revisions of tariffs to be carried
out in the future shall not affect the facilities already in operation. This guarantee provides
legal certainty for the producer, providing stability for the sector and promoting

its development.”7?>

607. The express guarantees contained in RD 661/2007, combined with numerous unequivocal
statements made by Spain’s representatives (including IDAE) and the special features of
the small-hydro sector, were reasonably understood by the Claimants as guaranteeing their
small-hydro installations the RD 661/2007 feed-in remuneration for their electricity during
their entire operational lives, without downward revisions in respect of existing facilities.
There was no Supreme Court case law that could have constituted a warning to the

Claimants of the possibility of regulatory changes. The first group of cases upon which

the Respondent relies did not concern the regime established under RD 661/2007; the
December 2009 judgments considered the replacement of RD 436/2004 by RD 661/2007,
which afforded greater certainty to renewable installations and led to a significant increase
in renewable investments, and do not support the Respondent’s contention that the
government had unlimited authority to make sweeping changes to the regulatory
framework for the small-hydro sector; the other group involved claims which were based
on RD 2366/1994 or RD 2818/1998 and did not concern RD 661/2007. In any event, even
if a reasonable investor in the small-hydro sector could have considered the pre-
RD 661/2007 judgments to be relevant, these judgments would not have enabled the
investor to foresee that Spain could abandon its commitments under RD 661/2007
altogether (notwithstanding the express guarantees in RD 661/2007) and that its
prospective investments in the small-hydro sector would be subject to a total and drastic

overhaul of the regulatory framework such as that subsequent imposed by Spain.

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent says that the second paragraph of Article 44(3) applies only to the
revisions to be made in 2010 and every 4 years.’”° The Article does not refer to “any”
revisions of the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits. That Article limited its
scope exclusively to the revisions provided in “this section” (este apartado).’”"
This paragraph of Article 44(3) only makes reference to the revisions which necessarily
must be performed “in 2010” and to the revisions which must necessarily be made every
“four years,” and provides that there will be mandatory revisions to take advantage of the
reductions in the costs inherent to renewable energy technologies. But it does not exclude
other unplanned revisions such as (i) those arising from the adoption of macro-economic
control measures, or (ii) to avoid over-remuneration or unreasonable rate of return, or

(iii) to guarantee the economic sustainability of the Spanish electricity system.

No investor conducting a diligent and exhaustive analysis of the regulatory framework
could deduce that Article 44(3) is a stabilisation clause with regard to opting between the
tariff and a premium, or updates based on the CPI. Article 44(3) only refers to the revisions
“of the regulated tariff and of the upper and lower limits”. Article 44(3) does not refer to
the update of the CPI; or to the possibility of introducing tax or other measures that will
directly or indirectly impact the return of the plants. No investor could claim that there is
a regulatory provision that would prevent the adoption of measures to ensure the economic
sustainability of the Spanish electricity system. If such a regulatory provision existed, it
would be contrary to the basic principle on which the Electricity Act 54/1997 rests, namely

the sustainability of the Spanish electricity system.

The Respondent’s position’** is: (1) the Spanish Supreme Court had clearly ruled since
2005 that what the Spanish legal framework guaranteed to the owners of facilities under
the Special Regime was a reasonable return on the project and not a given level of profits
or income nor the indefinite permanence of the formulas used to set the subsidies; and the
renewable energy sector was aware of that Supreme Court case law: not only the
Asociacién de Empresas de Energias Renovables (APPA, the main renewable energy

729 and

association, with close ties with the Claimants) but also the Claimants themselves;
(2) renewable energy investors and their advisers knew in May 2011 that: (a) previous
tariff changes had been made in 2006 and 2007, notwithstanding Article 40(3) of
RD 436/2004; (b) changes to RD 661/2007 would be possible if it was necessary due to
economic reasons, as happened in 2010; and (c) the Supreme Court case law allowed those

changes. ”*°

c. The Tribunal’s View
(i) Legal due diligence

611. HgCapital and the financial institutions involved had access to advice from three eminent

law firms.

612. HgCapital were advised by the international law firm, Allen & Overy, but, according to

Mr Quiroga:

Allen & Overy did not produce any regulatory and/or legal due
diligence reports prior to Claimants’ investments, and_ its
involvement was limited to drafting and advising on relevant
transactional documents, and conducting negotiations in relation to
the same on behalf of Claimants.”*!

613. In June 2011 the eminent Spanish law firm Garrigues was asked to give a due diligence
report to banks” in connection with the purchase of the Xana plants. Their review did not

include the question of regulatory risk:

... itis expressly stated on the record that it has been confined solely
and exclusively to the areas of Commercial Law and Administrative
Law ... and ... verification of the existence of administrative and
environmental permits necessary for the operation of hydroelectric
power stations ... and the verification and analysis of administrative
sanctioning procedures and judicial proceedings in relation
to them...”

614. The Respondent also relied on two documents relating to another eminent Spanish law
firm, Cuatrecasas Gongalves Pereira, which had advised HgCapital. The first was a Legal
Due Diligence Report given to HgCapital in 2009 in connection with its acquisition of
PV plants, in which it pointed out that the Lease Agreements contained termination clauses
in the event of (inter alia) “lack of viability of the project due to a change in the economic

regime” of RD 661/2007.’* The second was a report of an interview with Juan Carlos

Hernandez, a partner of the firm, in which he said that “no Royal decree is free from being

amended according to the regulatory risk theory.””*

615. Mr Quiroga’s written evidence was that due diligence focused among other areas on the
right of the plants to receive the FiT under RD 661/2007; and that their assessment of
regulatory risk was based (inter alia) on “exchanges with Spanish legal advisers specialised
in public and corporate law relating to the energy sector.”’*° In evidence at the Hearing,
Mr Quiroga said: (a) in 2010 he “was aware about some of the discussions around the
applicability of the Supreme Court decisions” to RD 661/2007;"*” (b) Cuatrecasas did not
warn him about the possible modification of RD 661/2007 and the relevance of the
Supreme Court decisions;”** and (c) there was no need to ask Garrigues about regulatory
tisk because the Claimants and the lenders had no reason to doubt the stability of the

regulatory framework.”

616. The striking result is that the Claimants never sought, nor received, advice on regulatory
tisk from the three eminent firms who advised the Claimants or the banks in relation to

their acquisitions.

617. The reason must have been that all parties were aware that there was a regulatory risk and
that the Supreme Court had held previous changes to be valid. Although it is unnecessary
to make a finding, it is hard to resist the conclusion that the Claimants deliberately avoided
being advised that regulatory changes could be made. In themselves the financing

documents are neutral on the question of the expectation of change. Consequently, the

share purchase and option agreements '*” provided that loss of or change in the tariff under

the Special Regime would not be a ground for termination, or for damages, whereas in the
financing agreements such a change might amount a material adverse change justifying a
requirement for early repayment.”! None of these documents shows any actual

expectation of change.

The Claimants must also be taken to have been aware through their legal advisers (a) of
the hierarchical superiority of Electricity Act 54/1997 which guaranteed reasonable
profitability with reference to the capital market which in turn was echoed and specified
by Decrees such as in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and (6) that Article 44(3) of RD
661/2007 was not of a general character but concerned only the revision of specific

premiums contained in “this section” (“apartado”).”

(ii) The 2010 PV changes

In addition, the Respondent relied on the fact that not only did HgCapital know about the
2010 changes, but also, as an investor in PV, it was actively challenging the changes

relating to PV in arbitration proceedings, which it had not disclosed to this Tribunal.

The changes made by RD 1565/2010 and RD-L 14/2010 have been set out above in
section III. RD 1565/2010 capped the quantity of electricity produced by PV plants
(inter alia) which was eligible to receive incentive tariffs and eliminated the tariffs after
25 years of operation, which was later extended to 28 years and then to 30 years; and
imposed a reduction in the tariff rate available to certain facilities enrolling in the
RD 1578/2008 regime. RD-L 14/2010 also imposed an access fee (of EUR 0.50/MWh) on
all producers (including small-hydro installations) for access to transmission and

distribution networks.

The Claimants say that they took comfort from Spain’s 2010 measures, which focused on
those technologies for which the government targets had been exceeded, namely PV, CSP
and wind; those measures only had a financial impact on PV, although temporary (a cap
on hours during 2011-2013) and with partial compensation (higher FiT extended for five
years after year 25); the hours caps imposed on CSP and wind, which were agreed with
those sectors, had no actual financial impact and these technologies received reinforced
assurances of regulatory stability; and these were presented as a “one-off” which were not
going to recur.’*? The reason given by Spain for RD 1565/2010 and RD-L 14/2010 was
that the feed-in remuneration for the PV sector was, as a result of exceeding government-
set targets, a major contributor to the regulated costs of the electricity system and to the
tariff deficit. The volume of PV installations registered under RD 661/2007 within the
one-year deadline stipulated in Article 22 of RD 661/2007 had greatly exceeded
government targets for that period. As a result, the PV sector accounted for the largest
portion of the feed-in payments: 37% in 2010 and 34% in 2011. By contrast, the total
installed capacity of the small-hydro sector was well below the targets set out in the
Renewable Plan 2005-2010 and RD 661/2007, and the feed-in remuneration for the small-
hydro sector made the lowest contribution towards the “extra costs” imposed by the
RD 661/2007 regime on the Spanish electricity system: between 1% and 4% between 2008
and 2013.4

Spain’s PV-specific regulatory changes therefore clearly indicated its intention to reduce
feed-in remuneration for only those technologies (such as PV) that it considered to be
significant contributors to that deficit, and not without introducing compensatory measures
(e.g. the extension of the tariff term under RD-L 14/2010). It also indicated that Spain
would not enact any adverse retroactive measures against those renewable technologies
(such as small-hydro) that were below Government-set targets and which made immaterial

contributions to the regulated costs of the electricity system.

Mr Quiroga’s evidence was that RD 1565/2010 and RD-L 14/2010 showed the Claimants

the conditions under which Spain might consider it necessary to make change to the

743 Rey. Tr. Day 2 (ENG), 168:22-169:5 (Mr Quiroga); and Rev. Tr. Day 3 (ENG), 9:4-9:23 (Mr Solé).

RD 661/2007 regime, namely, where a technology had substantially exceeded its installed
capacity target and was making a meaningful contribution to the regulated costs of the
electricity system.”*° The PV-specific measures of RD-L 14/2010 were justified on the
grounds that the PV sector was a major contributor to the regulated costs of the electricity
system as a consequence of said objectives being exceeded, but in small-hydro it would be
very unlikely that those conditions would apply, because the objectives were far from being
achieved and the sites were scarce, and in any event the total share of the cost that could
be attributed to small-hydro was insignificant, and so it would be irrational to seek any
savings from the small-hydro sector, because the total contribution was negligible.““° As
a result of the benefits of small-hydro facilities, including the fact it is the most
environmentally friendly technology and has a number of positive economic and social
externalities, there was broad consensus across the political spectrum on the merits of
small-hydro and on the need to increase its installed base, in particular to meet Spain’s
renewable energy targets under both international environmental protection conventions

and EU directives.

During the validation debate of RD-L 14/2010, the Minister of Industry, Tourism and

Commerce, Mr Sebastiaén Gascén, said:

... since 2009 the Government has been working for the adoption of
a set of measures whose common denominator is the regulated cost
rationalisation and reduction of the tariff defic’

 

... But the measures of 2009 and 2010 were not sufficient. The
imbalances were highlighted as a consequence of the appearance of
a series of adverse circumstances, in some cases exceptional, two of
which I would like to mention here. On the one hand, the growth
beyond that expected of some of the regulated costs during 2010, in
particular of the special regime premiums, and, on the other hand,
the evolution of the demand for electricity, which in 2009 decreased
by 4.7 percent ... These reductions in the demand for electricity
reduce the income from the system and mean that the fixed costs
must be paid by fewer consumers of electricity, thereby increasing
the cost per user. These two circumstances have increased the tariff
deficit and mean that the measures adopted to date to guarantee the

progressive reduction of the tariff deficit in a balanced manner

among all the agents in the sector have been inadequate. Therefore,

the need to urgently adopt new cost saving measures and new

revenue generation measures for the system to prevent the

destabilisation of our electrical system or excessive electricity tariff

increases. 74”
Mr Quiroga had read the speech as part of HgCapital’s due diligence, and accepted in
evidence that, although Mr Sebastian Gasc6n made specific reference to solar and wind

power, he did not mention, or exclude, small-hydro.”*8

In answer to the point made in the Counter-Memorial”? that RD-L 14/2010 was not solely
focused on the PV sector, and also imposed an access fee (of EUR 0.50/MWh) on all
producers (including the Claimants’ small-hydro installations) for access to transmission
and distribution networks, the Claimants say that this short-term measure was introduced
provisionally to comply with EU Regulation 838/2010 on laying down guidelines relating
to the inter-transmission system operator compensation mechanism and a common
regulatory approach to transmission charging, establishing that “the value of the annual
average transmission charges paid by producers shall be within a range of 0 to
0.5 EUR/MWh”.”° To put the EUR 0.50/MWh in perspective, the RD 661/2007 FiT for
small-hydro plants under 10 MW in 2011 was EUR 84.237/MWh. Even assuming that a
reasonable investor viewed this access fee as equivalent to a reduction of the RD 661/2007
tariffs, this constituted a reduction of only 0.59% for small-hydro. No reasonable investor
would have concluded in 2011 that such a de minimis access fee on all producers was a
precursor to the wholesale abrogation of the RD 661/2007 framework and its replacement
with a dynamic return- and capacity incentive-based New Regime that would practically

destroy the value of the Claimants’ investments in the small-hydro sector. Mr Solé and

Mr Quiroga confirmed that the access toll applicable to small-hydro introduced by

RD-L 14/2010 had only a de minimis effect on small-hydro.”*!

d. The Tribunal’s Conclusion

HgCapital invested in the PV sector in 2009 and 2010. At the time HgCapital said that

... “the regulatory framework and capacity targets for renewables in
Spain provide an attractive environment for investors looking for
stability with moderate returns”.

... “In addition to the photovoltaic sector, we believe there are

interesting opportunities in the wind, solar thermal and mini-

hydraulic sectors[.]”7>”
Following the 2010 changes, in November 2011 HgCapital (or group members), and other
PV investors, commenced arbitral proceedings under the ECT against Spain: PV Investors
v Spain.”>? The Respondent criticised the Claimants for not revealing the existence of these
proceedings to this Tribunal. It might have been appropriate for the Claimants to have
disclosed the existence of the proceedings, but there has been no prejudice to the

Respondent from the failure to do so.

But the 2010 changes are, in the view of the Tribunal, another reason for concluding that
the Claimants must have known that the RD 661/2007 was not immune from change as
long as it remained within the framework established in the Electricity Act 54/1997. In the
view of the Tribunal, the 2010 changes show that the Claimants must have been aware that
there could be changes to the regime, and that there might be further changes, but they do
not show anything about the anticipated scale of the changes, or their lawfulness, or

whether further changes might apply to small-hydro.

The Tribunal therefore accepts the Respondent’s submission that HgCapital could not have
been unaware of the fact that RD 661/2007 might be amended beyond the compulsory
revisions every four years under Article 44(3), since they had already experienced a
revision after three years which, in addition, HgCapital had claimed to be a breach of the
duties established under the ECT; and the Claimants invested after the 2010 changes, in
May and December 2011, with the knowledge and conviction that RD 661/2007 could be

amended without Article 44(3) representing a commitment to the contrary.

(3) Whether There Were other Reasons to Justify a Legitimate Expectation
that There Would be no Change to the RD 661/2007 Regime in Relation to
Small-Hydro, Including Specific Commitments

a. The Claimants’ Evidence on Due Diligence and their Internal
Documents
The Claimants’ evidence was given by Mr Quiroga, which was: (1) in 2011 HgCapital
concluded that small-hydro was widely considered to be “safest and most ‘bankable’
renewable asset class from the regulatory point of view in Spain;” (2) “any changes to the
regulatory regime for small-hydro would be extremely unlikely, and, even in that extremely
unlikely case, they would not impact existing investments, as Spain had guaranteed in
RD 661;”7*4 (3) small-hydro made the smallest contribution (less than 5%) towards the
extra costs imposed by the RD 661/2007 regime on the Spanish electricity system and
therefore had a limited impact on Spain’s tariff deficit; (4) small-hydro made a significant
economic and social contribution; (5) small-hydro was one of the most underdeveloped
renewable energy technologies relative to Government targets;’°> (6) there was a broad
political consensus (in both the ruling socialist party (PSOE) and the main opposition party
(Partido Popular’) that small-hydro should be developed further, and small-hydro was
not subject to the same political criticism that the PV sector had received; (7) the majority
of small-hydro assets in Spain (approximately 58% of the installed base) were owned by,

inter alia, large Spanish utilities (such as Endesa, Iberdola, and Acciona), and semi-public

entities such as farmers’ cooperatives and municipalities; (8) those stakeholders had
political access and accordingly a good insight into the regulatory environment, and shared
the same view as the Claimants in relation to the stability of the feed-in remuneration
regime for the small-hydro sector; (9) by investing in small-hydro, the Claimants would
see their interests aligned with those of domestic Spanish companies and semi-public
bodies; (10) small-hydro plants also constituted the majority of the State-owned advisory
body, IDAE’s own portfolio of renewable assets, and therefore any adverse changes to the
feed-in remuneration for the small-hydro sector would have hurt the IDAE materially;
(11) discussions with the AAPA did not reveal any concerns about the regulatory stability
of the small-hydro sector; and (12) financial institutions and investors showed confidence

in the regulatory stability of the small-hydro sector, as did market analysts such as Péyry.’*”

The Claimants produced a number of internal presentations for internal investment
committees, at least some of which were prepared by Mr Quiroga. HgCapital’s Country
Profile for Spain, February 2009,”* (which did not deal with small-hydro) noted under
“Renewable Power Resources/Hydro”: “Limited potential for growth, dwindling water
resource” (page 3); under “Stated Objectives/Other”: “Limited growth potential for hydro”
(page 4); and under “Risks”: “Regulatory uncertainty around tariff levels as capacity nears

targets (wind, CSP)” (page 8).

In connection with the plan to acquire small-hydro interests in 2011, the internal HgCapital
presentations for approval of the projects indicate a view that (1) acquisitions in Spain were
possible “due to the distressed nature of the sellers”; (2) hydro assets in Spain were a
“defensive play in view of regulatory uncertainty”; (3) the goal was to acquire “good
resource and equipment plants from distressed sellers”; (4) there would be “attractive
returns due to particular financial stress of vendors”; and (5) “[t]he purchase price for the

portfolio [was] unusually low due to the distressed nature of the sellers.” °°

In particular one of the “Key Potential Issues” identified in the February 2011 BRN Note’

was whether “the next government [was] likely to completely overhaul the Spanish
electricity system,” and under “Political/Regulatory due Diligence’: “Political agenda

761 said

regarding new electricity market reform if any” (page 5). The May 2011 IN Note
that “Hydro assets in Spain are the best regulatory risk adjusted asset class in Spain” and
stated: “Regulatory: Is the asset class protected from potential tariff changes?” (pages 4-

5). Under “Due Diligence Status” it was said (page 7):

Mini-hydro considered protected from regulatory changes as:

— Lowest cost renewable producer (net of concession fees, feed-in
tariff below wind)

— Small portion of the special regime cost (less than 3%)

— Majority owned by utilities and local administrations (58% of
installed base)

— Both the current government and the conservative opposition
favour growth in small hydro over other renewable energy
technologies

— Local governments benefit from concession payments by small-
hydro installations (€10/MWh or ca. 12% of revenues in the case
of Xana)
In March 2011, the HgCapital presentation said in relation to PV and RD 661/2007:’
“Material retroactive changes have materialized, due to lack of support by interest groups
(utilities) and contagion from debt markets” and in relation to CSP: “Further retroactive
changes possible if macroeconomic situation worsens,” but in relation to small-hydro:
“Material retroactive changes extremely unlikely” and “Reprice equity to compensate for
macro risk perception” (page 3, emphasis in the original) and “Dispatchability, long asset
life, low regulatory risk, low technological risk make the asset class highly attractive to

industrial and financial buyers” (page 7). Under the heading “Regulation” the presentation

says: “Although regulatory instability will continue in Spain for as long as there is a
tariff deficit it is clear to everyone that wind is very safe and we do not expect material

retroactive changes” (page 9).

In May 2011 it was being said that: “Hydro assets in Spain are the best regulatory risk
adjusted asset class in Spain” (page 4), and repeated “Key Potential Issues”: “Regulatory:
Is the asset class protected from potential tariff changes?” (page 5).’ In the same month
a presentation repeated the question whether “the next government [was] likely to
completely overhaul the Spanish electricity system.”’ In July 2011 a presentation
repeated in relation to small-hydro: “Material retroactive changes extremely unlikely” and
“Reprice equity to compensate for macro risk perception” (page 2, emphasis in

the original).’°

The Respondent places reliance on a statement from July 2011: “2012-2013: ... Prepare
for exit 2014 Exit!”,” and suggests that this demonstrates that the Claimants did not trust
that the tariffs would be maintained for 10, 15 or 25 years. But the Tribunal does not place
any weight on this point, since frequently the object of private equity enterprises is to sell
in the long or short term. Nor does the Tribunal derive any assistance from references to

regulatory risk in HgCapital’s annual accounts.

The view of the Tribunal of Mr Quiroga’s evidence and of HgCapital’s internal documents
is that they show the Claimants making business assessments of the potential investment
and the regulatory risk in the light of available sources and knowledge. Their assessment
was that the regulatory risk for small-hydro was lower than for other renewables. They
support neither side’s case. They do not suggest that there was no risk, nor do they suggest

that the Claimants considered that there was a real risk of significant change.

b. IDAE and Mr Tapia

This aspect of the case became increasingly more important as it progressed. The IDAE is
a State-owned advisory body that reports to the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Energy and

Tourism (the “Ministry”).

At the relevant time in 2011 Mr Isidoro Tapia was the Secretary-General of IDAE, and
Mr Quiroga had one or more meetings with Mr Tapia. In their Memorial, the Claimants
say that as part of their due diligence they observed that government institutions such as
IDAE shared the Claimants’ assessment that small-hydro would be protected from adverse
change, and the Claimants noted: “A confirmation by IDAE that the small-hydro sector
would be sheltered from any adverse regulatory changes and was considered a ‘safe haven’
for investors.””*’ In the Reply, the statements by Mr Tapia were said to be
“representations.””°* In the Claimants’ Post-hearing Brief, they became “a specific
assurance in respect of the stability of the RD 661 regime from a representative of the State,

Mr Tapia.”7°°

There is no dispute between the Parties about the nature of IDAE. The Claimants accept’”°

that the basic function of IDAE is to advise the Spanish Government on policy in relation
to energy efficiency and the renewable energy sector and to invest Government money in
these sectors, and that IDAE had no specific jurisdiction to regulate the Special Regime.
According to the Respondent,’”! IDAE’s duties are limited to providing technical advice
to the Ministry and to implementing the government’s policy on energy efficiency,
diversification of energy sources and promotion of renewable energies. IDAE can perform
technical assistance, service engineering, consultancy, project management or

implementation, advisory activities, etc. being authorised to directly or indirectly invest

in projects of energy interest through participation in already established or newly

created companies.

Prior to his appointment at IDAE, Mr Tapia had worked as an adviser to the Secretary of
State for Energy, where he was part of the government team which worked on the 2010
changes affecting PV plants. In December 2010 he notified the Claimants that he was
entering a new stage as Secretary-General of IDAE, and a meeting was arranged between

him and Mr Quiroga on 30 March 2011.77

The Tribunal considers that it is probable that there were several meetings at the offices of
IDAE with Mr Tapia, and that at least in one of them Ms Lépez, who was IDAE’s head of

the Hydroelectric, Sea Energy and Geothermal Department, was present.

(i) The Claimants’ account

Mr Quiroga’s evidence’”? was that in the course of 2011, he met Mr Tapia on numerous
occasions. HgCapital had first met Mr Tapia in 2010, in the course of meetings between
the Spanish Government and international investors, during which he defended the changes
to the PV sector as being necessary due to the government target for PV having been
exceeded by a multiple; the high cost of PV technology; and the temporary nature of the
changes and partial compensation provided. In 2011, they heard that Mr Tapia had been
appointed to a senior position within the IDAE. They understood that in his capacity as
the Secretary-General of IDAE, Mr Tapia had direct and frequent interaction with the

Ministry and that his position generally reflected that of the Ministry.

When they were considering investing in the Spanish small-hydro sector they contacted
him in order to assess the Government’s outlook for this sector. They had meetings, which
were formal in nature, and were conducted at the offices of IDAE (both in Mr Tapia’s
private office and in one of the larger meeting rooms at IDAE’s premises) in the presence

of Mr Tapia and other IDAE officials, including Ms Lépez.

Mr Tapia emphasised that investments in the small-hydro sector remained an area of focus
for IDAE, as that sector was sheltered from any adverse regulatory changes and was
considered a “safe haven”, because (I) the level of investment in the small-hydro sector
was clearly below government targets, and therefore more investment in the sector was
needed; (2) by comparison with other renewable technologies such as PV, the small-hydro
sector’s feed-in remuneration made the lowest contribution to the Spanish tariff deficit, and
there was no need for government policies seeking to reduce costs to target this sector;
(3) IDAE assumed regulatory stability in small-hydro, and IDAE, in making its own
investments in small-hydro assets, had based its Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) analysis
on an FiT tariff remuneration regime that was locked-in for the entire operational life of
the assets; and (4) small-hydro plants constituted an important component of IDAE’s own
portfolio of renewable assets and any adverse changes to the feed-in remuneration for

small-hydro would have hurt IDAE materially.

They also had a meeting with Ms L6pez, which Mr Tapia arranged in September 2011, to
discuss the possibility of acquiring IDAE’s minority stake in Hidroastur S.A.
(“Hidroastur”), a Spanish Company with a portfolio of small-hydro plants, but IDAE said
that it was reluctant to sell its stake as it had no intention of exiting the small-hydro sector
and in fact would rather expand its own small-hydro plant portfolio. The Claimants say
that this decision by IDAE confirms the Claimants’ contention that IDAE thought that any

future changes would not affect small-hydro.

(ii) The Respondent’s account

The Respondent””*

accepts that there was at least one meeting with Mr Tapia, but no
evidence is provided that Mr Tapia stated at any time that the small-hydro sector would be

sheltered from any adverse regulatory changes.

The meetings held between Mr Quiroga and Mr Tapia did not take place in the course of
exercising any authority legally attributed to IDAE, nor are they reflected in documents

through public tender procedures, meeting minutes, etc. The contact between Mr Quiroga

652.

and Mr Tapia was strictly informal in nature, and the correspondence shows that the
meeting was based on a previous personal relationship between Mr Quiroga and Mr Tapia,

rather than being an institutional contact between HgCapital and IDAE.

The Claimants had already attempted to invest in the mini-hydraulic sector some
months prior to their discussions with IDAE.””° If the Claimants had already attempted to
invest in the mini-hydraulic sector prior to their conversations with IDAE, without success,
the purpose of their subsequent conversations must have been to seek a new investment

opportunity, not to gain certainty as to the immutability of the remuneration system.

Ms Lé6pez’s evidence was that Mr Tapia could not have promised the Claimants the
maintenance of the regulatory framework for hydro plants, because the issues related to the
regulatory framework of this technology were discussed with her. He had no authority to
promise or commit to maintaining the current regulations for certain facilities, since IDAE
has no powers in legislative matters, which were exclusive to the Ministry. She was present
at a meeting with Mr Quiroga and Mr Tapia, but IDAE never promised (i) that the tariffs
were going to remain unchanged for operating plants, or (ii) that hydroelectric technology
would be treated differently to other renewable technologies, or (iii) that this sector would

be considered a “‘safe haven” for investors. She said:

What I told you before — and I believe I’ve already answered the
question — is that considering IDAE’s remit — because we were in
constant contact with the sector, and there were many warnings. The
sector was aware that changes were in the offing, and such changes
could never have left the mini-hydro technology. Changes have
always affected all technologies. So there was an expectation that
changes were to be made[.]’”°

Ms Lé6pez attended one of the meetings referred to by the Claimants and she confirmed
that no explanation was given that would allow the conclusion that the small-hydro sector

would not be affected by regulatory changes. When the Claimants went through

75 First Quiroga Statement, {ff 11, 45; HgCapital BRN Note ‘RPP2: Spanish Hydro’, p 4.

653.

654.

655.

656.

Mr Quiroga's statement with Ms Lépez and, in particular, the fact that the mini-hydraulic

sector was to be regarded as a “safe haven”, Ms L6pez said:

But my opinion, which I can give you and I can repeat again,
because I’ve been talking about this paragraph right from the very
beginning of this cross-examination, is that I would find that rather
astonishing, that such a commitment could ever have been
proffered, could ever have been made.

And these are the very words that I can read here in the witness
testimony: “safe haven”, these words are very odd. I’ve been
working here in this sector for 22 years. “Safe haven” in this area?
It’s impossible.”
The meetings were held because the Claimants were interested in acquiring the shares that

IDAE had in a small-hydro company, Hidroastur. IDAE refused to sell those shares.’”8

There is a contradiction by the Claimants in saying that they attended a meeting with the
double purpose of proposing the acquisition of some shares of Hidroastur and, at the same
time, obtain confirmation that there would be no regulatory changes in the sector in which

the investor has already decided to invest.

The alleged content of the meeting between Mr Quiroga and IDAE employees would
constitute, at best, an analysis of the probability or likelihood of a regulatory change from
an opportunity perspective. However, it does not constitute an analysis about the legal

possibility of introducing regulatory changes within the Spanish regulatory framework.

The Claimants say in response that Ms Lépez’s evidence is unreliable, and that she
expressed a definitive view on what was said at Mr Quiroga’s meetings with Mr Tapia,
even though she was only present at one of them?” but in cross-examination, she conceded
that she was not aware of what happened at the meetings which she did not attend.”*°

But she agreed with most of the statements on which Mr Tapia, according to Mr Quiroga,

based his assessment.’”®! She accepted that the 2011-2020 PER, which was issued
in November 2011 and reflected the views of the administration as of that date,
did not anticipate any change to the remuneration model for any technology, let alone

small-hydro. 7°”

The meeting which Ms Lo6pez did attend concerned a potential sale of certain small-hydro
assets held by IDAE. But IDAE decided not to sell, which begs the question, why would
IDAE have decided not to sell, if, as Ms Lopez contended, it knew of the regulatory

changes to come?

(iii) The Tribunal’s view of the evidence

Mr Tapia did not give evidence in this arbitration. He now works for the European
Investment Bank. According to Mr Quiroga,’** Mr Tapia originally agreed to give
evidence for the Claimants, but his employers refused permission, and he told Mr Quiroga
that when the Respondent’s lawyers approached him, he confirmed the Claimants’ version
of the conversations. Considering all the evidence in the round, the Tribunal considers that
it is probable that Mr Tapia gave the impression at meetings with Mr Quiroga that in his
view there would be no substantial regulatory changes to the regime in so far as it applied

to small-hydro.

The Claimants’ case on this aspect has varied. At the conclusion of the Hearing their
position was that they were not saying their case was that Mr Tapia made a specific
commitment: “It’s not about a promise”’** but rather “... Mr Tapia’s opinion was very
important” to Mr Quiroga.”*> But, as noted above, in its post-hearing brief, the Claimants
said that: “Furthermore, Claimants ... received a specific assurance in respect of the

stability of the [RD 661/2007] regime from a representative of the State, Mr Tapia.”7*°

662.

663.

But in the view of the Tribunal, what Mr Tapia is claimed to have said cannot be regarded

as a commitment or assurance on behalf of the Spanish State.

The Claimants say7*”

that (J) in his capacity as the Secretary-General of IDAE, Mr Tapia
had direct and frequent interaction with the Ministry, and prior to his appointment at IDAE,
Mr Tapia had worked as an adviser to the Secretary of State for Energy and therefore
benefited from direct access to senior Ministry officials thanks to his recent work there;
(2) the Claimants understood that Mr Tapia’s position generally reflected that of the
Ministry, and as such, IDAE (and those leading it such as Mr Tapia) were uniquely well-
placed to opine on the stability of the RD 661/2007 feed-in regime and its representations
demonstrated that the Government entities shared the same expectations regarding the
continuing application of the RD 661/2007 regime to the small-hydro sector; and (3) it was
therefore reasonable for the Claimants to take their representations into account when

making the decision to invest.

The Claimants accept’

that IDAE had no specific jurisdiction to regulate the Special
Regime, and that the purpose of the Claimants’ meetings with IDAE was not to seek
guarantees regarding the stability of the RD 661/2007 remuneration regime. They argue
that that does not negate the legitimacy of the Claimants’ expectations based on the IDAE’s
representations, relying on Micula v Romania: “The crucial point is whether the state,
through statements or conduct, has contributed to the creation of a reasonable expectation,
in this case, a representation of regulatory stability. It is irrelevant whether the state in fact
wished to commit itself; it is sufficient that it acted in a manner that would reasonably be

understood to create such an appearance.””*?

The Tribunal, however, accepts the Respondent’s argument” that any rational investor

was aware that the activity of the IDAE was merely technical and advisory, and that it had

665.

666.

667.

no authority to regulate the Special Regime, and that Mr Tapia could not have had authority

to make commitments or give assurances on behalf of the Respondent.

Nor can the Claimants derive much from the fact that IDAE retained small-hydro plants,
and would not sell its shares in small-hydro investments, including its 20% minority stake

in Hidroastur.

The Tribunal accepts that IDAE’s decisions are not based on profitability criteria.

Ms Lopez said:

IDAE’s role is to promote ... ferment renewable energies. One of
the actions taken by IDAE to promote renewable energies is to
invest in projects or in companies. But that’s just one line of action;
it’s not, by far, the only line of action. IDAE also cooperates with
the PERs and develops renewable energy projects; cooperate in
various measures, in referencing statistics and renewables,
publications on renewables. We have so many different lines of
action, the overriding purpose of which is obviously to promote
renewable energies.

Now, obviously our business is not commercial. It’s not

commercial. We're a public entity. And so our purpose is to

promote stations — PV, wind, what have you — to develop this sector,

so that they reach a level of competitiveness with the conventional

producers. That has been our purpose.”*!
Consequently, the Claimants were of course entitled to take account of Mr Tapia’s view in
making their business decisions, but the Tribunal does not regard those views as a

commitment of the Spanish State.

c. Other Alleged Assurances

The Claimants also rely”? on:

(1) A press release issued on 25 May 2007,”? the day on which RD 661/2007 was

approved by Spain’s Council of Ministers, stating that the aim of the legislation was

to establish a stable system of incentives guaranteeing an attractive return, with any

not shown that they ever had knowledge of it, but in any event it could not reasonably
create a real and objective expectation that the framework of RD 661/2007 was going to

remain unchanged.’°?

For those reasons, in the view of the Tribunal, these are not matters which could have given

rise to any expectations in 2011 when the Claimants made their investments.

d. Banks’ Willingness to Lend

The Claimants say that lenders were willing to provide long-term project financing for
small-hydro assets on the basis of Spain’s feed-in remuneration regime.**” At the time of
the Claimants’ acquisition, both the Xana and Ondina Portfolios had project finance in
place.*°! The Ondina Portfolio was refinanced in the summer of 2011, immediately prior
to the Claimants’ acquisition. In this refinancing, two of Spain’s largest banks, Bankia and
Banco Sabadell provided EUR 146 million of project finance and mezzanine debt to the
Ondina Portfolio. The existence of this project financing was an important part of the
Claimants’ due diligence work. The refinancing agreement itself indicated that the loan
presupposed regulatory stability, as can be inferred from the “banking case” (i.e. the
financial projections used to calculate the terms of the loan) which showed stable future
revenues implying a price per unit of electricity generated consistent with the FiT under
RD 661/2007. As part of their strategy to merge the Xana and Ondina Portfolios, the
Claimants sought interest from Spanish lenders such as Santander, Caixa Bank and
international banks (such as Natixis) to refinance those portfolios. The fact that all these
lenders, who were familiar with the renewable energy sector in Spain and who do not take
on the risk of regulatory instability, were willing to provide long-term project financing for
small-hydro assets on the basis of Spain’s feed-in remuneration regime further reinforced

the Claimants’ expectations as to the regulatory stability of the sector.*°

In the view of the Tribunal, the most that this shows is that, like the Claimants, financial

institutions were not anticipating major changes.

Overall the matters relied on by the Claimants were facts that an investor would have taken
into account in a risk assessment process, but they did not engender a legally enforceable
expectation that there would be no change. In particular, the special characteristics of
small-hydro were plainly capable of being weighed in the balance in taking business
decisions and business risks, but those characteristics did not make them immune from

change or subject to special considerations for FET purposes.

(4) Overall Conclusions

The Tribunal has concluded that the Claimants did not receive any specific commitments
or assurances in the legislation or otherwise that there would be no changes in the
RD 661/2007 regime, and that, on the contrary, the Claimants must have known that
change was legally and politically possible, even though they took the commercial view

that there was a low regulatory risk, especially for small-hydro.

The Tribunal will not repeat its factual findings, but it emphasises that when the Claimants
made their small-hydro investments, they or their bankers had been advised by two eminent
Spanish law firms (Garrigues and Cuatrecasas) and one eminent English firm practising in
Spain (Allen & Overy), none of whom was apparently asked to advise on regulatory risk
or on the powers of the Spanish legislature or executive to change the regulatory system.
None of them could have been unaware of the relevant decisions of the Spanish Supreme
Court (and indeed Mr Quiroga himself was aware of them in general terms). In addition,
not only had the 2010 changes been made when the Claimants made their small-hydro
investments, but HgCapital was itself challenging the 2010 changes under the ECT in
UNCITRAL arbitral proceedings.

But it does not follow that the Respondent was free to make radical changes to the regime
without incurring liability under Article 10(1) ECT, nor that the Claimants had no

legitimate expectations protected by the ECT and international law.

209

676.

The Tribunal has already pointed out:

(8)

On the face of Article 10(1) there is a separate obligation to “create stable, equitable

. conditions”, which includes a “commitment to accord at all times ... fair and
equitable treatment” and that irrespective of whether there is an express obligation to
create stable and equitable conditions, that such an obligation would be included in

the FET standard.

Stability is linked to the investor’s legitimate expectations that the legal framework

will not be arbitrarily changed and that commitments will be observed.

But it does not mean that an investor is protected from any change. The State has a

legitimate right to regulate, and the obligation has a relatively high threshold.

Regulatory measures must be proportionate, and the State should have due regard to
the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial

resources on the basis of the earlier regime.

The criterion of “unreasonableness” is not to be used as an open-ended mandate to

second-guess the host State’s policies.

A measure must be suitable to achieve a legitimate policy objective, necessary for
that objective, and not excessive considering the relative weight of each interest
involved, and a balancing or weighing exercise so as to ensure that the effects of the
intended measure remain proportionate with regard to the affected rights

and interests.

There is no general principle which prohibits the retroactivity of legislation, but it
may, depending on the context, be relevant to unreasonableness, breach of legitimate

expectation or destruction of acquired rights.

The State’s sovereign right to regulate has been affirmed in many awards, and the
State is entitled to a high measure of deference, and the requirements of legitimate
expectations and legal stability as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect
the State’s rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt its legal

system to changing circumstances.

(9) The idea that legitimate expectations, and therefore FET, imply the stability of the
legal and business framework does not mean the virtual freezing of the legal
regulation of economic activities, and there has to be a weighing of an investor’s

expectations and the State’s regulatory interests.

(10) Economic, social, environmental and legal circumstances and problems are by
their nature evolutionary, dynamic and bound to constant change, and it is
indispensable for successful public infrastructure and public services to be adaptable

to change in evolving circumstances.

(11) Consequently, changes to general legislation (at least in the absence of a stabilization
clause) are not prevented by the FET standard if they do not exceed the acceptable
margin of change in the exercise of the host State’s normal regulatory power in

pursuance of a public interest.

The Special Regime under RD 661/2007 gave registered installations the right to fixed
feed-in remuneration for the entire electricity output, with no cap on profitability, for their

operational lifetime, and free from downward reviews.

The overall effect of the 2012/2014 measures (which on 12 July 2013 the Government
described as a “structural reform” to correct the tariff deficit)®°? was to eliminate the

Special Regime generators’ entitlement to the regulated tariff.

As outlined in the account of the legislation above, the only option available to renewable
energy generators was to sell their entire electricity output at market prices, with the

possibility “in exceptional circumstances”®™*

of receiving from the State an additional
specific remuneration, which might include one or both of the following elements: (1) a
“remuneration to investment” (investment incentive) (RIN), per MW of installed capacity,
to cover the hypothetical investment costs of a “standard installation” that cannot be met

by market prices; and (2) a “remuneration to operation” (operating incentive) (ROP), per

(1) is calculated on the basis of standard historical values of the operation and performance

of a “standard facility” throughout its regulatory lifespan, so that it theoretically reaches a

target return; and (2) is only received by facilities which have not exceeded a certain

number of years of operation (25 years, in the case of small-hydro).

Remuneration parameters (including the rate of return) may be revised every three or six

years, including for existing facilities. The use of CPI as an index to inflation is abandoned.

There are no transitional provisions (no grandfathering for existing facilities).5°°

The Tribunal accepts that the main changes were these:

qd)

(2)

G)

The RD 661/2007 regime was based on maximisation of production while the New
Regime establishes a new remuneration framework applicable to existing
installations which is not production-oriented: through RD-2/2013 the Respondent
eliminated the premium under the “pool price plus premium” option under
RD 661/2007 and replaced the CPI-linked updating index in RD 661/2007 with a

lower index.

The RD 661/2007 regime was not subject to any cap on renewable installations’ feed-
in remuneration or investors’ level of profitability, whereas the New Regime subjects
existing installations to a cap by reference to a “target rate of return” on assumed
costs. The “target rate of return” (a) applies to both new and existing facilities; and
(b) takes into account the renewable energy installations’ past earnings under the
RD 661/2007 feed-in remuneration regime in order to reduce its specific

remuneration under the New Regime.

Under the New Regime, the new remuneration is calculated so as to theoretically
ensure the target return for standard facilities over their entire regulatory lifespan. If

the return obtained by a facility prior to July 2013 exceeds the new ex post target

return, the facility will no longer be entitled to regulated revenue under the
New Regime, irrespective of whether or not it has reached the end of its

regulatory life.*°°

(4) The RD 661/2007 regime entitled small-hydro plants to feed-in remuneration for
their entire operational lifetimes while the New Regime limits payment of the new
feed-in incentive to 25 years from the deemed dates of installations’ commissioning

without regard to their actual remaining useful life.

(5) The RD 661/2007 regime was based on kWh of electricity produced by each
individual plant and thus driven by actual plant-specific variables as determined by
the investor, while the New Regime sets new remuneration parameters derived from

hypothetical standard installations as set by Spain.

(6) The New Regime enables Spain to unilaterally vary the ex-post target return and
update the new remuneration parameters for both existing and new installations in

regulatory periods with limited scrutiny.

Even though, as indicated at paragraph 566 above, there is no allegation in this case of
failure to provide constant protection and security in the traditional sense of protection
against third parties, on the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal finds that there was
no breach of the separate constant protection and security/non-impairment obligations. But,
although the Claimants recognised and accepted some risk of change, the overall effect is
to amount to such a radical change in the renewables regime as to breach the FET obligation
of stability (or the legitimate expectation of stability) of the overall legal framework, by

dismantling the entire legal framework going back in different forms to 1998.

The change was unprecedented internationally, as the CNE recognised.*”’ The CNE
Report of 7 March 2012 proposed alternative measures, which were not adopted, including

(a) elimination from system regulated costs of certain items that are not strictly driven by

the activity of electricity supply; and (b) partial funding of Special Regime incentives by
sectors responsible for the consumption of fossil fuels, or alternatively by the State
Budget.®*

But breach of the obligation of stability would, in the present context, not give rise to any
damage unless the regulatory measures caused damage, for example as a result of

impermissible retroactivity or disappointing the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.

It is important to signal at this stage the close connection in this type of case between the

issues of liability and the issues of damages.
The Parties accept, as they must, the principle in the Chorzéw Factory case:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal
act — a principle which seems to be established by international
practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is
that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment
of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind
would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained
which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment
in place of it — such are the principles which should serve to
determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to
international law.5”

But the words in italics above are crucial. In the case of a subsidy regime, an investor
claimant is not automatically entitled to the difference between the subsidies before the
unlawful act (but for) and those after it (actual) in a case where the respondent State could
have enacted, and would have enacted, measures which would have reduced the subsidies

in the same or similar ways.

688. This indicates that the Tribunal has to assess what would have happened if the disputed
measures had not been enacted, and the answer must be that Spain would have enacted

some measures to deal with the tariff deficit.

689. — This is in line with what the tribunal in RREEF v Spain said of tribunals which had found
liability, that they had:

... considered that, since the Respondent had been found in breach
of Article 10 of the ECT, it was obliged to make full reparation for
the losses suffered; this has been the position taken by the Eiser and
Novenergia tribunals. This last position would be illogical in the
present case since the Tribunal accepted that the Claimants were not
immune from reasonable changes in the regime applicable to its
investment; therefore, it is only to the extent that the modifications
would have exceeded the limits of what is reasonable that
compensation would be due and should be calculated.*!°
690. The questions which then arise are these: what is the essence of the previous regime which
was abandoned and to what legitimate expectations did it give rise? In the view of the
Tribunal, the essence of the regime was that it was intended to promote, and ensure the
continuance of, renewables having a reasonable rate of return for their future lifetime
balanced against the cost to the consumer. This is a recurring theme from 1997 until, and

including, the disputed measures:

(1) Article 30(4) of the Electricity Act 54/1997 provided that the object of the
determination of premiums was to achieve reasonable profitability rates with

reference to the cost of the money on the capital markets.
(2) The Economic Report on RD 436/2004 prepared by the Ministry of Energy
emphasised that any plant in Spain in the special regime, provided it is equal or better

than the standard (the standardized plant) for its group, would obtain a reasonable

return.

(3) RD 436/2004’s preamble stated that it guaranteed the owners of the facilities under

the special regime a reasonable remuneration for their investments.

80 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, | 515. See also id., | 523.

215

691.

692.

(4) RD 661/2007’s preamble said that the economic framework established by it
implemented the principles contained in the Electricity Act 54/1997 guaranteeing
owners of facilities in the special regime a reasonable return for their investment and
the consumers of electricity an allocation of the costs attributable to the electrical
system that was also reasonable, and Article 44(3) contemplated a review from 2010
to determine whether the incentives still reflected (inter alia) a reasonable return for

the investor.

(5) The 2011-2020 PER also stressed that the system under RD 661/2007 was intended

to guarantee a reasonable return.

(6) The decisions of the Supreme Court of 25 October 2006 and 9 December 2009

referred to the reasonable return in the Special Regime system.

(7) RD-L 2/2013, RD-L 9/2013, Act 24/2013, and Order 1045 all purported to apply

notions of reasonable profitability or reasonable rates of return.

This puts into context what is called in some of the renewables cases*!' (although not in
the present case) the “‘claw-back” of past remuneration. It arises because the remuneration
from 2013 onwards is determined by subtracting all (theoretical) historical profits achieved

by a power plant since its inception.®!?

The new regulated, specific remuneration is
calculated so as to theoretically ensure the target return for standard facilities over their
entire regulatory lifespan. All income, both past and future, must be estimated and
considered. Consequently, if the return obtained by a facility prior to July 2013 exceeds
the new ex post target return, the facility will no longer be entitled to regulated revenue
under the New Regime, irrespective of whether or not the facility has reached the end of

its regulatory life.*!?

The Respondent’s position is that there is no issue of retroactivity because there is no

question of reimbursement of excessive returns. What is involved is establishing a

reasonable rate of return for the useful life of the facility, which makes it possible to take
into consideration the remuneration already received from the facility’s commissioning

date, for the purpose of calculating the future subsidies to be received.*!*

In RREEF vy Spain the tribunal decided that such retroactive application required
“appropriate compensation” for the damage that breach caused to the Claimants,*!> and
other tribunals have taken a similar view.*!® But in Isolux v Spain the tribunal took the
view that the fact that the new remuneration system took existing and past parameters into
consideration was not objectionable, since it applied to existing installations, but projected

all of its effects to the future.*!”

In the view of this Tribunal, it would be objectionable and contrary to FET for past
remuneration to be taken into account when determining a reasonable rate of return for the
future. It is not necessary to resort to the concepts of acquired rights to conclude that
removing subsidies for the future on the basis that reasonable returns have been made in
the past may involve (as it would in the present case) unfair and inequitable treatment in

breach of the FET standard.

The Tribunal agrees with the analysis in RREEF v Spain*'® that (1) the Claimants had a
legitimate expectation of receiving a reasonable return for their investment through special
means such as the FiT, designed to attract investments in a sector which was unattractive
at market prices; (2) the Claimants could legitimately expect a return for their investment
at a reasonable rate significantly above a mere absence of financial loss, taking into account
the cost of money on capital markets for such investments as well as other objectives;
(3) the Claimants were entitled to expect that the Respondent would not significantly
modify the legal framework applicable to the investors as provided for in Spanish law when

the investments were made, but not necessarily for their operational lifetimes; and (4) the

217

Claimants had, when they made their investments, a legitimate expectation of a reasonable

return on their investments, and that any modifications would be reasonable and equitable.

696. This Tribunal agrees with RREEF v Spain that it is not possible to say whether there has

been a breach until it has been decided that the projected rate of return is not reasonable:

the Claimants had, when they made their investments, a
legitimate expectation to get a reasonable return on_ their
investments. Such expectation did not include a guarantee to have
the legal regime in place unchanged until the end of the operation of
the plants, but it did include to have any modifications reasonable
and equitable. Whether such a legitimate expectation was violated
can only be assessed by way of a global view of the situation that
resulted from the modifications introduced by the Respondent after
the date of the investment. It is only in case the answer to this
question is in the affirmative that compensation is due to the
Claimants under this head of claim.*!

697. The real question which will determine whether the Claimants are entitled to compensation

is whether the remuneration of the facilities going forward (without reference to past

remuneration) accords with a reasonable rate of return.

698. The way in which this was approached in RREEF v Spain is apparent from the following

passages:

As recalled above, the Respondent has decided, in its own words, to
take into account “the remuneration already received from the
beginning of the operation of the facility, for the purpose of
calculating the future subsidies to receive [...].”” The Tribunal has
already concluded that such a means of calculation was in
contradiction with the principle of nonretroactivity and entailed a
right to compensation for the Claimants.

 

Since the Tribunal has determined that the only legitimate
expectation of which the Claimants could prevail themselves was
that of a “reasonable return”, it is appropriate to compare both
regimes depending on the IRR that the Claimants can get under each
of them. As the Novenergia Tribunal put it, “the internal rates of
return is a relevant measurement for what the Claimant was

89 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, { 399.

218

expecting to get from its investment in the Kingdom of Spain at the
time of making the investment.”

As a result, the Tribunal considers that, while entitled to
compensation for unreasonable return on their investments — if
established —, the Claimants cannot claim full compensation for
the total decrease in their profits as a result of the adoption of
the new regime by the Respondent; they can only get compensation
to the extent that such decrease is below the threshold of a
reasonable return. *2?
699. However, in this case, neither the Claimants nor the Respondent adopted this approach.
Each approached the question of compensation very differently, as will appear from the

next section of this Decision.

VII. DAMAGES

A. The Parties’ Positions
(1) The Claimants’ Approach to Compensation

700. The Claimants say that the New Regime is backward-looking in the calculation of the
return and note that, once an installation is judged to have recovered its investment (while
achieving the ex post target rate), it is no longer entitled to any specific remuneration.
Based on the application of this methodology, from the next regulatory period commencing
1 January 2020, the Claimants assert that only 8 of their small-hydro plants are likely to

receive any specific remuneration. **!

701. The Claimants’ approach to the calculation of resulting compensation is that they are
entitled to receive the diminution in the fair market value of their equity and debt
investments plus additional amounts to compensate for losses they said they

would suffer.**

702.

705.

The Claimants rely on the Chorzéw Factory case and say that where, as here, restitution is
impracticable, they are entitled to monetary compensation that will wipe out the
consequences of the Respondent’s unlawful acts and place the Claimants in the same
pecuniary position in which they would have been if the Respondents had not breached the
ECT. They say this should be achieved by assessing the “fair market value” of the affected
investment, supplemented, as necessary, by any profits already lost by the valuation date,

as well as any additional losses resulting from that conduct.*?3

The diminution of value was calculated by the Claimants’ experts, Compass Lexecon,
using a DCF model of Free Cash Flows to Equity (“FCFE”). The calculation was made on
the basis of historical cash flow losses from 1 January 2013 (the date when Act 15/2012
came into effect) to a “date of valuation,” which is stated to be the date of the award, plus
losses in fair market value of the Claimants’ equity and debt investments as of the “date of
valuation” plus the loss in the fair market value of the Claimants’ debt investments as at

the “date of valuation.”

The Claimants maintain that the DCF methodology is typically applied by international
tribunals, in particular where the business in question is a going concern and had a
sufficient record of operations. They also submit that it is settled law that in the case of
unlawful conduct by the State an investor is entitled to choose between a valuation as of

the expropriation date and as of the date of the award, whichever is higher.*”>

The Claimants note that Compass Lexecon estimate the total damages as of
31 August 2017 to be EUR 132.1 million and at the date of breach to be EUR 108.1 million.

The Claimants submit they are entitled to the higher figure.*”°

The Claimants’ experts did not produce a damages assessment based on a reasonable

827

return,’ although they did carry out what the Claimants refer to as “a reasonability check

... by calculating operational equity IRRs for both the Xana and Ondina portfolios.”**8
The Claimants say this shows equity IRRs in the actual case of 2.8% and 0.5% for the

Ondina and Xana portfolios respectively.*”

(2) The Respondent’s Approach to Compensation

The Respondent’s experts did not produce a valuation of the losses suffered by the

Claimants on their debt and equity investments.**°

The Respondent considers that such an approach fails to take into account the concept of
regulatory entire lifespan and omits the joint consideration of cash flows, past and future,
in order to guarantee a reasonable rate of return on the investments that were made.*?!
It submits that arbitration doctrine and case-law tend towards verifying that investors get
their investments back plus a reasonable rate of return on the costs of those investments
and that the DCF approach has been rejected on numerous occasions and can lead to the

overvaluation of financial impacts based on future events.*°?

The Respondent states that its experts, Econ One, have calculated the economic impact of
the measures on the plants and have concluded that the measures have had a positive impact

on them.**

This conclusion is based on the approach that, in view of the age of the hydroelectric plants
(the Xana plants have been in operation for more than 20 years and some of the Ondina
plants for more than 90 years) they should be considered as having been fully amortised.

In consequence, Econ One consider that they are projected to generate substantial positive

cash flows from operations, such that the Xana plants will operate at a margin of about

30% and the Ondina plants at a margin of about 55%.°**

The Respondent notes that Econ One calculates the IRR on the plants to be 17.1%.**°

Econ One say that they consider it is most appropriate to calculate an “exit IRR” (17.1%),
which assumes the Claimants sell the plants rather than a “holding IRR” (16.4%), which
assumes the Claimants retain the plants. Having said that, they note that neither calculation
changes their conclusion that the IRR is well in excess of the reasonable rate of return on

the plants.*°°

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ claim is based on a simplistic comparison of
scenarios, real and counterfactual, and assumes that the real scenario is going to be
maintained during the next decades, ignoring that the guiding principle of the system is

constituted by reasonable guaranteed return.*°”

Further, the Respondent says that the Claimants’ “but-for” scenario does not admit the
State’s right to regulate or the possibility of regulatory changes and it is, therefore, a
fictitious, broadly overestimated, scenario. It submits that the damages calculated by
Compass Lexecon should, at any rate, be reduced in line with the actual regulatory risk
existing prior to the measures; otherwise, it would deny the State’s right to regulate or the

possibility of regulatory changes. ***

The Respondent also takes issue with the Claimants’ contention that an investor is entitled
to choose between a valuation as of the expropriation date and as of the date of the award.

The Respondent refers to Article 13(1) of the ECT which states:

Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the

investment expropriated at the time immediately before the

expropriation or impending expropriation became known in such a

way as to affect the value of the investment (hereinafter referred to

as the “valuation date”).
The Respondent submits that this demonstrates that the only valuation date considered in
the ECT is the date of the measure which is challenged under the ECT, and that this date
is the only one which guarantees compliance with the principles of full reparation

and causality.*°°

B. The Tribunal’s Analysis

(1) Aggregation or Individual Plant

As will be apparent from the conclusion reached by the Tribunal, what determines whether
the Claimants are entitled to compensation is whether the remuneration of the facilities
going forward from the date of the New Regime (without reference to past remuneration)
accords with a reasonable rate of return. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider the
DCF approach adopted by the Claimants to be the correct way to calculate any

compensation which may be payable.

The approach taken by the Respondent accords more closely with the manner in which the
Tribunal considers any compensation payable should be calculated, in that it seeks to
establish an IRR. However, that IRR is not calculated on the correct basis in that it takes
into account the remuneration already received from the beginning of the operation of the
plants for the purpose of calculating the future subsidies. This was an approach with which
the RREEF v Spain tribunal disagreed and which this Tribunal also considers to

be incorrect.

Further, the Respondent aggregates the IRR of the individual plants, and then of the two

portfolios, to produce a final IRR.

723.

Econ One say that:

To determine whether the Measures had a negative economic
impact, it is more accurate to calculate the IRR of the combined
Hydro Plants. This allows us to determine the average return of all
the plants by mitigating the individual effects of outlier plants that
might be performing above or below average for reasons unrelated
to the Special Regime.

This can be illustrated with the Hydro Plants. The combined IRR of
the Hydro Plants is 17.2%. If we separate the two portfolios, the
IRRs of the Xana and Ondina Hydro Plants are 6.6% and 22.0%,
respectively. Given that both portfolios operate under the same
Special Regime, the fact that one has a lower IRR is a clear
indication that specific Xana Hydro Plants are performing below
average for reasons unrelated to the Special Regime...

The calculation of the combined IRR of the Hydro Plants allows us

to mitigate these plant-specific effects.**°
The Tribunal considers there is a fundamental inconsistency with arguing that a reasonable
rate of return should be calculated on an individual plant basis but then aggregating the

individual plants to iron out inconsistencies.

If, as the New Regime contemplates, a reasonable rate of return is to be calculated on the
basis of a theoretical individual standard facility or plant, then the IRR of the individual
real facilities/plants should be used as the comparator. If the IRR of a particular
facility/plant is above the calculated standard reasonable rate of return it should not attract

compensation, if it is below, it should.

If a portfolio comprised just three small-hydro plants and two had extremely low IRRs, and
one had a higher IRR, well above the rate of return fixed by the regulator, with the
consequence being that, overall, the portfolio was below that rate of return, would the

regulator, with equanimity, subsidise all three plants? Clearly not.

728.

The clear rationale behind the legislation is to consider what constitutes a reasonable rate
of return on a plant by plant basis and the Tribunal finds there is no justification for an
aggregation approach. The fact that a plant happens to be in a portfolio owned by a
particular investor should not impact whether that plant is considered to make a reasonable
rate of return. Each plant should be considered on its own, as would have to be the case if

each were individually owned by different investors.

The Tribunal also notes that in RREEF v Spain, the Respondent adopted an individual

project approach:

Both the Claimants and the Respondent agree that the reasonable

return targeted by the Spanish law is a project IRR. The Tribunal

see[s] no reason to decide otherwise. **!
Having concluded that the reasonable rate of return should be considered on an individual
plant basis it is then necessary to consider firstly, what constitutes a reasonable rate of
return, secondly how the IRR of the individual plants should be calculated, and thirdly
whether each of those plants are achieving a rate of return above or below that which has

been calculated to be reasonable.

(2) Reasonable Rate of Return

a. Pre-tax or Post-tax

The New Regime altered a variable system of target returns for various renewables to a
target of 7.398% for all renewables. The first question, therefore, is does that constitute a

reasonable rate of return for small-hydro facilities?

This question, and this approach, is consistent with the approach taken by the
RREEF vy Spain tribunal which was not willing simply to accept that the target set by the

New Regime constituted a reasonable rate of return.5””

731.

732.

The RREEF v Spain tribunal noted that the rate of return fixed by the regulator at 7.398%
is a pre-tax rate of return and commented:
To assess the reasonability of these returns, the Tribunal has to

calculate post-tax figures. The Tribunal considers that taxes are
costs impacting the return of the Claimants’ investments.

 

The Parties disagree on the targeted post-tax project under the new
regime. The Claimants consider that 7.398% IRR pre-tax is
equivalent to an average 5.8% IRR post-tax for CSP plants; for its
part, the Respondent denies these rates but without giving its own
numbers. *43

In this case, the Claimants assert that 7.398% pre-tax is equivalent to a post-tax reasonable
rate return of 5.549%;'+ the Respondent asserts the equivalent post-tax figure is 7%.*45
It is not clear to the Tribunal what taxes have been included by the respective experts in
their calculations, so the Tribunal is not in a position to decide whether the post-tax

equivalent of the pre-tax figure of 7.398% is 5.5%, 7% or another figure.

In any event, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in RREEF v Spain that taxes are costs
impacting the return of the Claimants’ investments and, in consequence, the measure of
what constitutes a reasonable rate of return should be considered on a post-tax basis. Thus,
rather than simply accepting that the post-tax equivalent of 7.398% pre-tax is a reasonable
rate of return, it is necessary to calculate, on an appropriate basis, what does constitute a

reasonable rate of return in the small-hydro market in Spain.

b. Reasonable Rate of Return Calculation

In RREEF v Spain, the tribunal found that the reasonable post-tax rate of return was WACC
(as calculated by the tribunal) plus 1% and found the Respondent to be in breach of its
obligations to ensure a reasonable rate of return insofar as the return per plant, in that case,

was lower than the figure it calculated.*4°

“3 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, 1" 571-572.

“4 First Compass Lexecon Report, 56.

*5 Second Econ One Report, { 314.

“6 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, {{] 586 to 589 and 600(3).

226

733. In RREEF v Spain the tribunal considered a WACC calculation was required because the
legislation mandated the calculation must be made by reference to the cost of money, and

both sides had proceeded on that basis:

According to Act 54/1997, the reasonable return should be assessed
“with reference to the cost of money in the capital market”.
The Tribunal understands this reference to the cost of money in the
capital market as a guideline to assess the reasonableness of the
return generated by the plants. Under this cost of money, a project
is likely to be seen as being not profitable, and no investor would
likely invest in it. A reasonable return has therefore to be superior to
this cost of money. To calculate this cost of money, both Parties
calculated the WACC, which “reflects the cost of raising funds from
shareholders and lenders for a typical company operating in a

given industry”.*47

734. The tribunal in RREEF v Spain calculated WACC as at June 2013 (which it determined to

be the correct date):

... taking into consideration the Spanish 10 years bond as the risk-
free rate that is 4.398%, a market risk premium of 5.5%, a beta of
0.455%, a ratio debt/equity of 60/40 and a cost of debt of 3.43% in
2013 (as calculated by the Respondent and taking into consideration
that both Parties use the 30% corporate tax rates). The WACC
calculated by the Tribunal on this basis is 5.86%.*48

735. The RREEF v Spain tribunal then added 1% to this figure on the basis that the claimants in

that case:

... had legitimate expectations that the return on their investment
would be above the mere level of the WACC since the Respondent
attracted investments in the renewable energy sector by raising hope
of above-average profits.*4?

“7 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, 4 574 (internal footnote omitted).
“8 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, 586.
“° RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, 587.

227

736. The RREEF v Spain tribunal thus found:

Consequently, the Respondent must be held responsible for a breach
of its obligation to [e]nsure a reasonable return to the Claimants
investment and it must pay to them a compensation amounting to
the difference between their actual return and the reasonable rate of
return as calculated above by the Tribunal: 6.86%.°"

737. This approach seems consistent with what Compass Lexecon say in their Second Report:

Furthermore, it is not uncommon for regulators to provide rates of
return above the WACC to achieve desired objectives. For example:

a. In Spain, the regulator used a premium over the WACC in
setting tariffs so as to promote speedy deployment of
renewables, and in particular in those technologies
where deployment was below government targets, such as
small-hydro.

b. In other regulated energy sectors in Spain, such as gas storage,
the regulator has set returns to at least the WACC + 300 basis
points.

°

. In at least 12 European jurisdictions, regulators provide

premiums over the cost of capital for energy network
utilities!

738. In this case, the Claimants’ DCF analysis involves a Cost of Equity calculation made at
differing dates (8 July 2015 and 30 September 2016) to account for the cost of raising
equity for a hydro plant portfolio in Spain, and the Claimants’ experts Compass Lexecon
conclude that the average pre-tax WACC for renewable energy investments from 1989-

2016 was 13.76%.

739. The Respondent does not produce a WACC calculation and its experts simply raise

criticisms of the calculations made by Compass Lexecon.

When it comes to calculating what constitutes a reasonable rate of return, the Tribunal sees
no reason to depart from the principles adopted by the RREEF v Spain tribunal, namely
taking the appropriate post-tax WACC calculation and adding 1%. In doing so the Tribunal
notes that the Respondent’s experts, Econ One accept the principle that a benchmark for a

reasonable rate of return needs to include an uplift on risk free investments.**?

As for the constituent parts of the WACC calculation, the Tribunal agrees with the
RREEF vy Spain tribunal that the appropriate date is the date of the relevant legislation,
namely June 2013.

The Tribunal also considers that, for the same reasons as the RREEF v Spain tribunal,
the average yield on Spanish 10 year bonds should be taken as the risk-free rate,

namely 4.398%.°°3

As for the other components of the calculation, namely market risk premium, applicable
beta, appropriate debt/equity ratio and cost of debt in 2013, the Tribunal does not have
sufficient material from the experts to be able to come to firm conclusions at this stage.
The Claimants use a market risk premium and beta in their cost of equity calculations**
but the CAPM approach used by Compass Lexecon is criticised in general terms by
Econ One and it is not clear to the Tribunal, in consequence, whether there is any measure
of agreement between the Parties as to appropriate figures for these two elements of the
calculation, not least because Econ One consider that an illiquidity discount should be

included and Compass Lexecon disagree.**>

852 First Econ One Report at J 299 “One benchmark for the reasonable rate of return is the average yield of government
bonds in Spain, German, and United Kingdom, plus 3 percentage points.”

853 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, | 580: “Concerning an investment in Spain, the Tribunal is more
convinced by the Claimants approach to use the average yield on ten-year Spanish government bonds as the relevant
free-risk rate. All the more so that RD-L 9/2013 itself provides that ‘[s]uch reasonable return will be based on, before
taxes, the average returns in the secondary market of the State’s ten-year bonds plus the adequate differential’.”

747.

The Tribunal agrees with RREEF v Spain in principle where the tribunal stated:

Both Parties have calculated a post-tax WACC for renewable energy
companies. They differ significantly in their results. The
Respondent calculates a WACC of 4.9% while the Claimants’
calculation comes to about 8.148%. This difference lies mainly in
the fact that the Claimants have only calculated a cost of equity,
using Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), while the Respondent
calculated both a cost of equity and a cost of debts, taking into
consideration the common financial structure of the projects.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent[’s] approach. Considering

that the reasonable return provided by the Respondent is allocated

to the project, it seems logical to take into consideration the financial

structure of the whole project. The return obtained by the projects

will be used to remunerate both equity and debt. The Tribunal

follows the Respondent calculation on this point and accepts the

following financial structure: debt 60% / equity 40%. Consequently,

it will be necessary to leverage the beta, that is the “company’s

systematic risk”, in the calculation of the cost of equity, as does

the Respondent.*°°
Further, there is the question as to what taxes to include, and at what rates. Although there
has been some discussion of this by the experts, there is no detailed explanation as to the
approach taken by each, at least so far as the Tribunal has been able to discern, no doubt

as a result of the different approach each side has taken.

In consequence, unlike the RREEF v Spain tribunal, this Tribunal is unable, at this stage,
to state categorically what constitutes a reasonable post-tax rate of return for small-hydro
assets save to express the expectation that it is likely to be somewhere in the region of 5.5%

to 7%. More assistance is, therefore, needed from the experts.

c. Calculation of the IRR of the Individual Plants

Just as the reasonable rate of return should be calculated on a post-tax basis, so should the

IRR of the individual plants.

230

748.

749.

750.

751.

752.

As to what taxes should be included in the calculation, again the Tribunal adopts the

RREEF vy Spain approach:

Therefore, taxes must be taken into consideration for the global
assessment of the reasonable return to which the Claimants are
entitled and the IRR should be evaluated post-tax. This applies in
particular to the 7% levy. The Tribunal recognizes that Article 21(1)
of the ECT is a carve-out from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and,
therefore, it does not take a decision over the legality of the levy.
But this does not change the fact that the levy has an impact on the
return. In this respect, the Tribunal recalls that it has decided that the
7% levy has to be taken into account in this calculation.**7
Another basic question to be considered in calculating the IRR of the individual plants is

whether the IRR is to be calculated on an exit basis or on an operational/holding basis.

Econ One calculate an exit IRR although they say “In any case, the difference between the
exit IRR and the holding IRR is not significant enough to affect either Compass Lexecon’s
conclusions or our own. We conducted a sensitivity analysis which shows a holding IRR
of 16.4%, that is, similar to the exit IRR of 17.2%. Both the exit IRR and the holding IRR
are above all benchmarks presented in our Reports. Thus, the distinction between holding

and exit IRRs is irrelevant in this case”.*°*

Compass Lexecon criticise Econ One’s exit analysis and say “the Operational IRR is
consistent with the benchmark return, and furthermore relies on fewer assumptions
(namely, there is no need for a discount rate or to speculate on an exit date), it is more

objective and, therefore, it is better suited for Econ One’s analysis”.°°°

As the name suggests, an operational IRR represents the return from operating the plants
until the end of their useful life (with no assumed exit sale). In RREEF v Spain the tribunal
noted that the lifetime of plants has a major impact on holding IRR calculations and, after

determining the lifetime of the CSP plants to be 25 years, was happy to conclude that the

887 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, 571.

231

753.

754.

755.

756.

distinction made between the exit IRR and the holding IRR did not have a major impact

on the calculation in that case. The tribunal did, however say:

As the IRR determined to be applicable in this case by the Tribunal

is the project IRR, it is assumed that the profitability will be

calculated during the whole life of the investment, that is the lifetime

of the plant.
Ministerial Order MO IET/1045/2014 limits payment of the specific remuneration for
small-hydro installations to the regulatory useful life of a hydropower plant, which has
been set at 25 years, after which projects will receive no specific remuneration. A “useful
life” of 25 years is clearly inappropriate when considering the actual lifetime of small-
hydro plants and the concessions to produce electricity which have been granted to them.
The Tribunal considers the actual lifetime should be used when calculating the operational

IRR of the individual plants in the Xana and Ondina portfolios.

Effectively, the lifetime of the small-hydro plants will be determined by the end date of the
concessions granted to the individual plants and the Tribunal considers this to be the most
appropriate way of fixing the lifetime of the plants. In paragraphs 35 and 39 of their First
Report Compass Lexecon set out tables which show the end of concession dates for the
individual plants comprising the Xana and Ondina portfolios respectively. The latest date

in the Xana portfolio is 2063 and in the Ondina portfolios, 2061.

The Tribunal is not aware that any doubt has been cast on these tables and considers that
the dates in those tables should be the ones used to represent the lifetimes of the individual

plants when calculating their operational IRRs.

Each set of experts in RREEF v Spain had provided pre-tax IRRs for each of the plants in
question. The calculations differed but as the 3 solar plants averaged out at approximately
7% and the 3 wind plants at 13% (with the lowest individual calculation being 12.6%), the

tribunal was able to conclude that post-tax IRRs of the individual wind plants would be in

80 RREEF v Spain Decision on Responsibility, 4 548 (internal footnote omitted).

232

excess of its calculated post-tax reasonable rate of return of 6.86% and found that Spain

was not in breach of its obligations in respect of the wind plants.**!

757. As for the solar plants, although the parties’ experts disagreed as to the post-tax IRRs for
the individual plants, all the calculations for all the individual plants came in below the
post-tax reasonable rate of return of 6.86%.°°?

758. Having reached that conclusion, the tribunal then told the parties and their experts to go
away and to reach an agreement with respect to each of the solar plants on the amount of
compensation to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimants in respect of its breaches of

its obligations.°
759. In this case, the Tribunal notes that Compass Lexecon have stated that:

The 15.3% post-tax exit IRR Econ One computes is for the Xana
and Ondina Portfolios combined. We have disaggregated Econ
One’s figures for each Portfolio separately, finding that there is a
large discrepancy between the two Portfolios: the post-tax exit IRRs
are 4.5% for the Xana Portfolio and 22.2% for the Ondina Portfolio
under the Measures. Such a discrepancy stems from the flawed
implementation of the Ondina Portfolio IRR, due to two main
reasons:

»

. First, 87% of the Ondina Portfolio’s capacity was already online
by 1930. The capital expenditure figures Econ One uses are based
on accounting values from the financial statements for years 1999
onwards, while these plants were built over half a century before.
These accounting values therefore most likely do not represent
the true cost of building the plants, given the distortions created
by, among other things, inflation, depreciation and maintenance
CAPEX.

s

Second, if the project IRR is to be computed for the life of the
plants, the cash flows since the plants came online in the early
1900s should also be taken into account.*+

760.

761.

762.

763.

If the disaggregation performed by Compass Lexecon is correct, it seems more than likely
that some compensation is due to the Claimants in respect of some of the plants in the Xana
portfolio, even if none is due in respect of Ondina. It is, of course, possible that a few
Ondina plants may be below the properly calculated reasonable rate of return and
compensation may be payable in respect of those individual plants also, depending on the
validity of the criticisms made of Econ One’s approach to calculating the operational IRRs

of the individual plants.

d. Next Steps

As stated above, unlike the RREEF v Spain tribunal, on the basis of the information
available from the experts to date in this case, this Tribunal is unable, at this stage, to state
categorically what constitutes a reasonable post-tax rate of return for small-hydro assets,
and is unable to be certain which, if any, of the individual plants in the Xana and Ondina
portfolios have a post-tax holding IRR below such level of reasonable post-tax rate of

return and, therefore, in respect of which the Claimants are entitled to compensation.

Accordingly, in order to make any finding as to any compensation that may be due to the

Claimants, the Tribunal needs to have:

(1) an agreed post-tax reasonable rate of return calculated using the WACC as at

June 2013; and

(2) agreed post-tax holding IRRs for the individual plants in the Ondina and Xana

portfolios.

Insofar as agreement is not possible between the Parties on either or both of the above, the
Tribunal will require submissions, on those two matters and, on the basis of their respective
submissions what, if any, compensation each side considers appropriate for those plants

which have a post-tax IRR below the post-tax reasonable rate of return.

865

With regard to calculation of the post-tax reasonable rate of return, the Tribunal has
provided some principles which the Parties should follow, namely the calculation date of
June 2013, that the calculation should be post-tax, that the risk-free rate should be the
Spanish 10 year bond rate of 4.398%*and that a reasonable rate of return will be 1%

above whatever the result of the WACC calculation turns out to be.

The Tribunal is, equally, conscious that there are some components of this calculation upon
which it cannot give guidance as they have not been discussed in detail between the experts,
namely the market risk premium, the beta, the debt/equity ratio and the correct approach
to tax (save that the 7% levy and the Water Levy should be taken into account in

the calculation).

The Tribunal therefore invites the Parties to attempt to reach agreement on the two matters
above and, insofar as the holding IRR of any of the individual small-hydro plants falls
below the calculated and agreed reasonable rate of return to agree the compensation due to
the Claimants amounting to the difference between the actual rate of return of the small-

hydro plant in question and the reasonable rate of return.

The Parties are therefore directed to agree within 42 days (or such longer period as may be
agreed by the Parties or directed by the Tribunal) following the notification of this decision
on a reasonable timetable for reaching agreement on what constitutes a reasonable rate of
return for small-hydro projects in Spain, what are the individual holding IRRs of the plants
in the Xana and Ondina portfolios and, in consequence, what, if any, compensation is

payable to the Claimants.

In the absence of agreement on a timetable within the period set out above, the Tribunal
will, following consultation with the Parties, set a timetable for submissions from the

Parties on whatever the Parties have failed to agree.

Costs are reserved.

In doing so the Tribunal notes that this removes the need for any country risk premium to be used.

For the reasons set out above:

the Tribunal declares that it has jurisdiction over the Claimants’ claims in the present

arbitration;
the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants’ claim under ECT, Article 13(1);

the Tribunal declares that the Respondent might (or would) be in breach of ECT,
Article 10(1), if and to the extent that the remuneration of each of the plants in the
Ondina and Xana portfolios failed to accord with a reasonable post-tax rate of return
in the small-hydro market in Spain on the basis of WACC plus 1%, with the risk-free
rate being the Spanish 10 year bond rate of 4.398%;

the Tribunal accordingly directs the Parties to endeavour to agree on the bases in
Section VIII B hereof (i) an agreed post-tax reasonable rate of return calculated using
the WACC as at June 2013; and (ii) agreed post-tax holding IRRs for each of

the plants;

the Tribunal directs the Parties to report to the Tribunal within 60 days hereof
whether agreement has been reached, and if not, on the principal areas of

disagreement;
the Tribunal will give such further directions as may be necessary;

the Tribunal reserves all consequential matters, including interest (if any) and costs,

to a further Decision or final Award.
