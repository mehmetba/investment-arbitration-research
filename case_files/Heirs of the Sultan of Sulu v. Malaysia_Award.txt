(henceforth, the Updated Procedural Calendar) and with Procedural Order 44 for the
abovementioned arbitration.

2. Claimants in this arbitration are, jointly, (i) Nurhima Kiram Fornan; (ii) Fuad
A. Kiram; (iii) Sheramar T. Kiram; (iv) Permaisuli Kiram — Guerzon; (v) Taj — Mahal

Respondent). Claimants and Respondent will henceforth also be referred to jointly as the
Parties.

3. The Final Award seeks to determine the differences addressed by the Parties
during the present arbitration. The Arbitrator will decide on the admissibility and the
factual and legal merits of the Parties’ respective claims. The footnotes are to be considered
part of the Final Award.

Il. THE BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE

4. The arbitration concerns a dispute which arose between Claimants and
Respondent on the legal characterization and enforcement of an instrument over a portion
of territory along the North Coast of Borneo —known today as Sabah, Malaysia- concluded
on January 4, 1878, between Sultan Mohammed Jamal-ul Alam and Messrs. Alfred Dent
and Baron Gustavus de Overbeck, an Austrian Consul General from Hong Kong
(henceforth, indistinctly, the Deed or the 1878 Agreement).!

5. Mr. Alfred Dent applied for a Royal Charter from the British Government on
December 2, 1878. In July 1880, Mr. Dent established the British North Borneo
Provisional Association Limited (hereinafter, the British North Borneo Provisional

Exhibit C 13. The Spanish translation of the Deed refers the date of January 4, 1878 and prevails over the English
(Exhibit C 14), for the reasons contained in 4 126 of the Preliminary Award. It is its English translation which
determines that date on «...the 22 of January in the year 1878...». The Final Award will refer to January 4, 1878 as
the date of the Deed.

Association), for it to apply to the British Government for a Charter of Incorporation of a
company to be constituted for the management of the 1878 Agreement.? Mr. Overbeck
relinquished all his rights and interests in the affair to Mr. Dent on September 1, 1880,
leaving Mr. Dent in control.? On November 1, 1881, the British Government granted the
Royal Charter and the British North Borneo Company was incorporated (hereinafter, the
British North Borneo Company).‘ The British North Borneo Provisional Association was
dissolved and the British North Borneo Company started to operate in May 1882.° On
April 22, 1903, the Sultan of Sulu and the British North Borneo Company concluded a
confirmatory deed of the 1878 Agreement (hereinafter, the 1903 Confirmatory Deed).®

6. Claimants are direct descendants and legal heirs of Jamal-ul Kiram II (1894-
1936), the last Sultan of Sulu and North Borneo and successor-in-title of the signatory of
the 1878 Agreement.’ Malaysia, on its part, admitted that it became the successor-in-title
of the British North Borneo Company under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed upon the establishment of its Federation on September 16, 1963.8

7. The Parties have antagonistic views on the substantive aspects of this dispute.

8. Claimants characterise the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed as
a commercial transaction, a leasing agreement of certain territory along the North Coast
of Borneo, constituted for an undetermined period with Malaysia and in return of a series
of annual rental payments. On this basis, Claimants seek to vindicate before Respondent
their commercial rights under the terms of both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed.®

Claimants plead a principal claim that they have been complying with both the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, but Malaysia, on its part, would have
incurred in a fundamental breach of its essential payment obligations under their terms
since January 1, 2013, for reasons attributable, in their opinion, to the Respondent, as it
admitted by the latter in its correspondence of September 19, 2019.1!

Final Award

Claimants seek, as main remedy,’ the termination of the 1878 Agreement pursuant to
Article 7.3.1 of the UNIDROIT Principles as of January 1, 2013 or, in the alternative, as of
February 2020," so that:

A. Ifthe Final Award declares January 1, 2013 as the date of termination of both
the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, Claimants submit that
they are entitled to the restitution value of the rights over the leased territory
along North Borneo, with interest as of January 1, 2013, of USD 32.20 billion,
or alternatively, USD 24.15 billion, or alternatively, USD 16.10 billion and so
seek reimbursement from Malaysia; or, alternatively,

B. If the Final Award declares February 1, 2020, or a later date, as the date of
termination of both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed,
Claimants submit that they are entitled:

a. To the restitution value of the rights over the leased territory along
North Borneo, with interest as of February 2020, of USD 26.71 billion, or
alternatively, USD 19.28 billion, or alternatively, USD 12.85 billion; and

b. To non — performance damages for the (adapted or rebalanced) unpaid
rent from 2013 to the date of termination of the 1878 Agreement, which
amounts to USD 5.72 billion, or alternatively, USD 4.29 billion, or
alternatively, USD 2.86 billion, plus interest and so seek reimbursement
from Malaysia.!4

Claimants plead, as an alternative claim, that the 1878 Agreement had become
unbalanced to their detriment, as the surrounding circumstances at the time of its
signature would have radically changed by the subsequent discovery of natural resources
(i.e., hydrocarbons and palm oil) during the decade of the 1970s. Claimants allege that the
Parties would not have been unable to anticipate nor to include this expansion in either
the 1878 Agreement or the 1903 Confirmatory Deed and failed to make any further
amendment of both documents after said discoveries. Claimants seek the delimitation by
the Arbitrator of the scope and terms of a properly rebalanced agreement, under the
hardship doctrine contained in Article 6.2.2 of the UNIDROIT Principles, as alternative
relief, if the Arbitrator does not terminate the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory
Deed.'6

Also, as alternative relief, if the Final Award does not terminate the 1878 Agreement and
the 1903 Confirmatory Deed and decides to restore its equilibrium, Claimants seek:

A. From January 1, 2013 to the date of the Final Award, as unpaid rent under the
1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, the amount of USD 5.72
billion, or alternatively, of USD 4.29 billion, or alternatively, of USD 2.86 billion,
plus interest, and so seek reimbursement from Malaysia;!’and

B. The determination of all future annual rent payments in the rebalanced amount
of USD 714 million, or alternatively, of USD 535 million, or alternatively, of USD
357 million.

9. Respondent had chosen not to be involved in the present procedure from the
beginning of the case, except for a short period of time that will be considered in further
Sections of the Final Award.

Notwithstanding its voluntary absence, Respondent submitted a letter dated September
19, 2019, addressed to Claimants —incorporated into the proceedings as Exhibit C 52- and
later attached to its email submitted to the Arbitrator on October 3, 2019, with copy to
Claimants.!8 This email and its attachments were also incorporated into the proceedings.

Further, on January 4, 2021, Claimants submitted Exhibits C 114 to C 118, which were
also incorporated into the proceedings.

On December 17, 2021, the Arbitrator received, by email, an ex parte communication from
Malaysia in this arbitration (henceforth, the ex parte communication of December 17,
2021), informing him, amongst other issues, of the existence of a suspension order, dated
December 16, 2021, rendered ex parte upon reasoned request by Malaysia before the First
President of the Paris Court of Appeal (henceforth, the Suspension Order). The Suspension
Order and the Respondent’s request of December 17, 2021 were incorporated into the
proceedings. The effects of the Suspension Order in this arbitration are analysed in
Section IV.4.viii.D of this Final Award.

 

 

The contents of the email of October 3, 2019, of Exhibits C 52 and C 114 and of the
reasoned request of Malaysia to obtain the Suspension Order allow the Arbitrator to
portray the Respondent’s main contentions on the substantive aspect of this dispute.

Respondent rejects Claimants’ position as to the legal characterisation of both the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed. It affirms that, jointly considered, the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed would constitute an instrument for the
permanent cession of territorial sovereignty over certain territories of North Borneo by
the Sultan in favour of both Messrs. Alfred Dent and Baron Gustavus de Overbeck.

Fornan et al v Malaysia

Final Award

Therefore, the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed would affect Malaysia’s
sovereignty and, as such, the Respondent would challenge its substantive arbitrability.
Malaysia would also consider its sovereign immunity breached by this arbitration.!9

However, Respondent admits that it had paid the agreed monies both under the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed to Claimants «...continuously... until 2010.
For the years 2011 and 2012, the Cession Monies were paid directly to the heirs of the Sulu
Sultanate...Regrettably, payments ceased in 2013. Malaysia is now ready and willing to
pay your clients all arrears from 2013 to 2019, and agrees to fully comply with the 1878
Grant and the 1903 Confirmation of Cession from henceforth with regards to future
payments...».2°

These Exhibits contain no relief sought by the Respondent in this arbitration.

10. The Arbitrator has considered all the factual and legal arguments presented by
the Parties in their submissions.

The Parties’ fuller summary of their positions and specific requests for relief are contained
in Section VI of the Final Award. The Arbitrator has carefully considered in his analysis
the sparse written submissions from Respondent and the Claimants’ written memorials,
including case law, and oral pleadings made at the convened hearings throughout the
arbitration.

To the extent that these arguments and cases are not referred to expressly in the Final
Award, they should be deemed to be subsumed into the Arbitrator’s analysis.

procedural organization of the arbitration, in accordance with the proposed agenda of
matters for possible consideration, prepared by the Arbitrator and enclosed in Procedural
Order 5. Claimants were represented by their Counsel. Respondent —aware of its

site.

42. As previously stated, at 20.17 hours (Madrid Time), on October 25, 2019 -to

the appointment of Dr. Arias and Mr. Capiel as its Counsel in this arbitration.

Respondent’s Counsel sought the stay of the proceedings for one month from the date they
had got access to the filed documents, sustained on the limited information allegedly
provided by its client, apparently insufficient to familiarize themselves with its content
and with the case. Respondent’s Counsel did not specify the date on which this
documentation was received from its client, nor whether Respondent was aware of having
been convened for the Preparatory Conference and the eventual procedural consequences
of its inaction.

Claimants sent an email addressed to the Arbitrator —with copy to Respondent- on October
26, 2019, objecting to the suspension sought by Respondent and proposing to move forward
with the arbitration, as decided in the Preparatory Conference. Respondent’s Counsel
rebutted Claimants’ arguments on October 26, 2019, through an email sent to the
Arbitrator, with copy to Claimants, where he referred to {76 of the Notice of Arbitration,

that Claimants reserve the right to request that the Sole Arbitrator revisit the Updated
Procedural Calendar, should it become clear(er) as this matter proceeds that Malaysia chooses

51. Respondent failed to acknowledge receipt, nor did it provide any comments on
the Updated Procedural Calendar.

52. The arbitration suffered some difficulties -unexpected and unforeseeable,
beyond the responsibility of the Arbitrator- from the end of June 2021, which created a
disruptive situation. Section IV.4.viii of the Final Award will detail these difficulties. As a
consequence of this situation, Procedural Order 42 declared the proceedings in abeyance
from July 20, 2021 until October 30, 2021 and stayed the deadline for rendering the Final
Award, as contained in the Updated Procedural Calendar. The abeyance of the proceedings

Respondent and they were incorporated into the proceedings.”

57. The Arbitrator warned Respondent that if it failed to avail itself of the
opportunity to present its case on jurisdiction and applicable substantive law to the
Arbitrator —notwithstanding having been given such opportunity to do so- he would
proceed to determine its jurisdiction and the substantive law applicable to the matter at

the issue of jurisdiction and applicable substantive law (if any) by no later than 20.00

Claimants characterised the Clerk Communication of July 7, 2021 and the Clerk

Claimants confirmed their willingness to proceed with the arbitration with this Arbitrator
remaining in office until the issuing of the Final Award, during the hearing of July 7,
2021.9 The Exequatur of the Preliminary Award ratified this reasoning.

126. Based on these arguments, Procedural Order 42, rendered on July 20, 2021,
considered that the Arbitrator should not be swayed by outside pressures, including
unauthorised intrusion by local courts, such as the Clerk Communication of July 7, 2021,
and the Clerk Communication of July 12, 2021, in breach of Article 7 of the SAA. According
to the principle of minimum interference with the arbitral process contained therein, if
the arbitration process has been initiated, it follows that (i) judges cannot prohibit parties
from initiating arbitration, and (ii) judges cannot interfere in an ongoing arbitration. This
provision excludes judicial intervention except for cases especially provided for in the SAA,
so that the scope for the court to intervene by injunction before an award is rendered by
arbitrators is very limited.

127. Procedural Order 42 (i) confirmed that the Arbitrator remained in office, (ii)
stayed the present arbitration proceedings to ensure his jurisdiction and to protect their
integrity and legitimacy pending the clarification of the situation generated by the
Decision of June 29, 2021, the Clerk Communication of July 7, 2021, and the Clerk
Communication of July 12, 2021 and (iii) invited the Parties to comment and inform the
Arbitrator on the evolution of this situation, including whatever procedural steps were
adopted by the Parties to facilitate the continuation of this arbitration and the rendering
of the Final Award —whichever occurred first- at their earliest convenience. 1° The
Arbitrator refers the Parties to its contents.

Arbitrator in the ex parte communication of December 17, 2021 that it had filed an appeal
against the Exequatur of the Preliminary Award on December 10, 2021, before the Paris
Court of Appeal, but did not submit to this proceeding a copy of its arguments.

C. On the Relocation of the Place of Arbitration

133. Madrid was selected in the Preliminary Award as the place of arbitration
based on its consideration as a neutral venue, located in a third country from that of either
of the Parties (see Section IV.3.v of this Final Award).1°°

134. On October 11, 2021, Claimants also submitted their reasoned request to
relocate the place of arbitration so established from Madrid to Paris. It was based on the
concurrence of two factors, after the Preliminary Award: (i) the Exequatur of the
Preliminary Award, which implies the recognition of the Preliminary Award in France,
and (ii) the questionable interference by the Civil and Criminal Chamber of the Superior
Court of Justice of Madrid, in view of the Decision of June 29, 2021, and the subsequent
Clerk Communication of July 7, 2021, and Clerk Communication of July 12, 2021,
characterised as supervening events aimed at stopping the present ongoing international
arbitration proceedings without any legal support.!07

136. The Arbitrator carefully considered this submission in Procedural Order 44.199

137. The Arbitrator confirmed that the Arbitration Agreement —valid- remains
silent on the issue of the place of the arbitration; it was determined in the Preliminary
Award. The Arbitrator also ensured himself that Claimants were entitled to request a
modification of the place of arbitration and that the Parties failed to reach any agreement
on this relocation otherwise. The arbitration proceedings were closed as of March 26, 2021,
according to Procedural Order 40. The Final Award had not yet been rendered at the time
Claimants filed the request for relocation.

138. In the absence of an agreement by the Parties and any other rule for the
relocation thereof, the Arbitrator assessed Claimants’ request, «...having regard to the
circumstances of the case and the convenience of the parties...».1!°

139. The Arbitrator concluded that circumstances that gave rise to the need of a
relocation of the place of arbitration from Madrid to Paris were reasonably unforeseeable
at the time the Arbitration Agreement was entered into and at the time the Preliminary
Award, rendered.

140. As explained in Section IV.4.viii.A of this Final Award, the Decision of June
29, 2021 vacated the Judgment of March 29, 2019, amongst other decisions. The Decision
of June 29, 2021, rendered two years after the conclusion of the judicial appointment of
this Arbitrator, thus created a disruptive situation in the arbitration, with no analogous
precedent known to date in Spain.

141. The Clerk Communication of July 7, 2021, and the Clerk Communication of
July 12, 2021 followed the Decision of June 29, 2021 and were served on the Arbitrator.!"

The Arbitrator characterised the Decision of June 29, 2021, the Clerk Communication of
July 7, 2021, and the Clerk Communication of July 12, 2021 as supervening events to the
Preliminary Award that threaten to render the Arbitration Agreement inoperative or
incapable of being performed and the Parties’ legitimate expectations in the arbitration,
thwarted.

Final Award

The Clerk Communication of July 7, 2021, and the Clerk Communication of July 12, 2021
lack any support in the provisions of the SAA and therefore can be categorized as an
unauthorised local—court intrusion on this ongoing arbitration process, in breach of the
principle of judicial non—interference recognised by Article 7 of the SAA,!!2 by the New York
Convention "* and by the Geneva Convention, !4 both ratified by Spain. 1° These
provisions leave no room for national courts to supervise or regulate the arbitrator's
procedural decisions during an ongoing arbitration.

It follows that this intrusion will simply lead to the relocation of the current place of
arbitration —Madrid- to another venue (Paris) where no local courts interfere with the
arbitral adjudicatory process —at least, until the enforcement stage is reached- and allow
the parties full control over the procedural and substantive rules governing the
arbitration.116

142. It is the Arbitrator’s view that the Decision of June 29, 2021, the Clerk
Communication of July 7, 2021, and the Clerk Communication of July 12, 2021 create a
certain risk for the Parties of incurring in a denial of justice in Madrid, as the Parties
would not be able to exercise their rights of access to arbitration under the Arbitration
Agreement and pursuant to the Exequatur of the Preliminary Award as the agreed
mechanism to solve their current dispute on the Deed.” Claimants confirmed their
willingness to proceed with the arbitration and with this Arbitrator remaining in office
until the issuing of the Final Award, during the hearing of July 7, 2021.18 The Exequatur
of the Preliminary Award ratified this reasoning. The right of a party to an arbitration
agreement to submit its dispute to arbitration is part of French public policy.

143. France is a favourable venue for international arbitration. Its legal climate is
supportive of international arbitration, which legal framework is established through the
provisions of the FLA. Its Article 1505.4 confers on the courts the power to support any
international arbitration proceedings if a party is at risk of denial of justice.!!® Its Article
1448.1 provides a legal safeguard which reinforces the authority and discretion of the
Arbitrator in the case at hand to conduct the proceedings. This provision enables the

Parties to conduct the present arbitration in accordance with the principles of due process
and equal treatment and without undue interference by the courts of the place of
arbitration.

144, Within France, Paris is a well-established impartial and neutral venue, a
major arbitral seat where the prominent factors to be considered in the selection of a
reliable place of arbitration concur, located in a third country from that of either of the
Parties.

The neutrality of the present arbitration proceedings or of the Arbitrator will not be
impaired. France signed the New York Convention on November 25, 1958 and ratified it
on June 26, 1959. The New York Convention entered into force in France on September
24, 1959. To date, only the reciprocity reservation remains in force, as France withdrew
the commercial reservation on November 17, 1989. France signed the Geneva Convention
on April 21, 1961 and ratified it on December 16, 1966.

Its election as the place of the arbitration does not and will not be seen as favouring either
of the Parties.

145. For these reasons, the Arbitrator decided in Procedural Order 44, to uphold
Claimants’ request for the relocation of the place of this arbitration from Madrid to Paris.
The Arbitrator refers the Parties to its contents.

D. On the Suspension Order

146. Mr. Tim Portwood, acting on behalf of Malaysia but without submitting proper
evidence of such representation, addressed the ex parte communication of December 17,
2021 to the Arbitrator, by email. The ex parte communication of December 17, 2021
contained a letter, with enclosures, informing of the filing by Malaysia of an appeal against
the Exequatur of the Preliminary Award on December 10, 2021, before the Paris Court of
Appeal and of the existence of the Suspension Order, which was also attached, along with
its request filed before the First President of the Paris Court of Appeal and dated
December 10, 2021 (henceforth, the Suspension Order Request).

147. On December 18, 2021, the Arbitrator acknowledged receipt of the ex parte
communication of December 17, 2021 and attached both the email received and its exhibits
to Claimants, once noted that Claimants had not been copied by Respondent and so

preserving Parties’ fundamental rights in this arbitration. The Arbitrator invited
Claimants to provide their comments by December 18, 2021.!2°

148. In the ex parte communication of December 17, 2021, Malaysia requested that
the arbitration be immediately discontinued —«...by December 20, 2021...”- on the basis of
the Suspension Order, as the «...First President of the Paris Court of Appeal has: (i) stayed
the effects of the [Exequatur Order]; (ii) barred Messrs. Nurhima Kiram Fornan, Fuad A.
Kiram, Sheramar T. Kiram, Permaisuli Kiram-Guerzon, Taj Mahal Kiram-Tarsum
Nuqui, Ahmad Nazard Kiram Sampang, Widz Raunda Kiram Sampang and Ms. Jenny
K.A. Sampang from availing themselves of the [Exequatur Order]...».

Respondent’s representative, Mr. Portwood, stated that «...nothing in this correspondence
or in the suspension order should be construed as participation in or acknowledgement by
Malaysia of the legitimacy of the proceeding or any of the decisions and orders rendered by
you in the proceedings, including the purporting change of the arbitral seat to Paris,
France...”. 21 The Arbitrator noted Respondent's awareness of both the ongoing
arbitration and the decisions rendered in the proceedings. !22

149. Claimants submitted their views on December 22, 2021, pursuant to the
Arbitrator’s invitation of December 18, 2021.

Claimants rebutted Respondent’s position on the suspension sought based on several
arguments. Claimants denied that the Suspension Order could have any effect on the
arbitration itself, as the Preliminary Award is still recognised in France and incorporated
into the French legal order by virtue of the Exequatur of the Preliminary Award.

Claimants rejected that Malaysia’s sovereignty is at risk, as the sole purpose of the
arbitration, in their opinion, is to adjudicate a commercial dispute under the UNIDROIT
Principles.

Claimants also considered that the Suspension Order is flawed and cannot serve for the
intended purpose of the Respondent, because the Suspension Order cannot have any effect
on the arbitration under the FLA.

“2 Claimants acknowledged receipt on December 18, 2021, at 18:17 hours, Madrid Time. The Embassy of Malaysia in

Final Award

Claimants finally sustained that the Suspension Order cannot curtail, delay or disrupt the
ongoing arbitration proceedings and characterised the Respondent’s request for this
arbitration to be discontinued on such basis as procedurally and substantially groundless
under Article 1526 FLA.

Claimants thus requested that the Respondent’s pretension be dismissed, and arbitration
continued as planned to issue the Final Award.

150. Having considered the Parties’ arguments carefully, the Arbitrator rejected
the Respondent’s request contained in the ex parte communication of December 17, 2021.

The Preliminary Award had declared on May 25, 2020 the validity of the Arbitration
Agreement and the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction over the claims made by Claimants in their
Notice of Arbitration, pursuant to Article 22 of the SAA.

The Preliminary Award has not been set aside by any Court, as the Clerk Communication
of October 14, 2021 confirmed. At the date of the Suspension Order being rendered, the
Preliminary Award was still recognised in France, as the Exequatur had incorporated it
into the French legal order.

Respondent confirmed in the Suspension Order Request that «... Malaysia does not ask the
Tribunal to intervene in the arbitral proceedings...». Therefore, Respondent admitted that
the Suspension Order had no effect on the arbitration and proceedings continued as
planned.!23

151. Mr. Tim Portwood, apparently acting on behalf of Malaysia but without
submitting proper evidence of such representation, addressed a further ex parte
communication of February 18, 2022 only to the Arbitrator, by email (henceforth, the ex
parte communication of February 18, 2022). Claimants were not copied.

The ex parte communication of February 18, 2022 contained a letter, which was both
intimidatory and coercive, with terms which cannot be acceptable in any circumstance.
Respondent reiterated its request that the arbitration be immediately discontinued,
already sought in the ex parte communication of December 17, 2021.

The Arbitrator enclosed the ex parte communication of February 18, 2022 in its Procedural
Order 50 for proper service and information of Claimants under the principles of due

process and procedural fairness, which comprises, amongst others, the following rules:

a. Throughout the proceedings, the parties shall be treated with equality;

b. Each party shall be given a full opportunity to present its case at all stages of
the proceedings and to rebut its opponent case at a meaningful time and

manner;

c. All written pleadings, documents or other communications supplied to the
arbitral tribunal by one party shall be communicated to the other party; and

d. The parties are entitled to be legally represented.

The Arbitrator invited Mr. Portwood to provide a letter of representation in his favour,
given by his apparent client, Malaysia, and a written confirmation by Respondent that
has duly authorised its Counsel, Mr. Portwood, to act and express himself in this
arbitration on its behalf and of his procedural activities in this arbitration (i.e., the ex parte
communication of December 17, 2021 to the Arbitrator and the ex parte communication on
February 18, 2022).

The Arbitrator also informed the Parties of an ongoing criminal investigation against the
Arbitrator, initiated by Respondent —according to the summons received by the Arbitrator-
before the Prosecutor’s Office at the Provincial Court in Madrid early in February 2022
which has been referred to Criminal Court of Madrid number 40 for further investigation
under the Spanish Court of Criminal Procedure.

152. On February 23, 2021, Mr. Portwood submitted his views, pursuant to the
Arbitrator’s invitation contained in Procedural Order 50, portrayed as follows:

«... Dear Sir,

Iwrite as counsel of Malaysia in France in the context of the defence of its interest in connection
with (but without any form of acknowledgement of the legitimacy of or participation in) the
supposed «proceedings» in which you purport to act as «sole arbitrator» (the «Purported
Proceedings») despite:

— the Spanish courts’ decision rendered on 29 June 2021 annulling your appointment as
arbitrator and all subsequent acts (the «Annulment Decision») and those courts’ clear
instructions to you to stop the Purported Proceedings; and

— the ex-parte order rendered on 16 December 2021 by the First President of the Paris
Court of Appeal upon reasoned request by Malaysia (the «Suspension Order»), through
which the First President of the Paris Court of Appeal has «stay[ed] the effects» of the
exequatur order on the basis of which I understand you allege to find grounds to carry
on the Purported Proceedings.

For good order, I note that you were informed of the Suspension Order on 17 December 2021
and that its nature and effects were further explained to you by letter of 18 February 2022.

Despite the above, the facts of which Iam aware show that you are still purporting to act as

This letter is a formal notice sent on behalf of Malaysia for you to stop the wrongful acts
committed by pursuing the Purported Proceeding:

 

Should you fail to put an end to these wrongful acts, Malay

  

ia will seek your liability for
continuously acting as an arbitrator in these Purported Proceedings and for the consequences
for Malaysia of any purported «final award» that may be rendered in these Purported
Proceedings, as well as for the costs of challenging any such «final award» and its enforcement,

 

if, wherever and whenever this may occur.

Should you have counsel instructed to represent you, please do not hesitate to provide me with
his or her contact details or to request that he or she reaches out to me directly.

 

This correspondence is sent exclusively to preserve the rights of Malaysia and without prejudice
to (i) Malaysia’s sovereign i including its jurisdictional immunity and ity from
execution, (ii) Malaysia’s rejection of and challenges to the Purported Proceedings, and (iii)
Malaysia’s claims and defences relating to the Purported Proceedings.

Nothing in the fact or contents of this correspondence should be construed as participation in
or by Malaysia of the legitimacy of the Purported Proceedings or any of the
supposed «decisions» and «orders» rendered by you in the Purported Proceedings, including the

 

 

purported change of the supposed «arbitral seat» to Paris, France. The Purported Proceedings
are illegitimate, null and non-existent. For the avoidance of doubt, this correspondence is not a
procedural request within the framework of the Purported Proceedings; it is a formal notice.

Sincerely yours...».

Claimants were not copied. The Arbitrator acknowledged receipt and enclosed
Respondent’s Counsel letter, with copy to Claimants, for proper service and information
under the principles of due process and procedural fairness.

153. Claimants submitted their views on February 23, 2022, pursuant to the
Arbitrator’s invitation contained in Procedural Order 50 and portrayed as follows:

«...Dear Dr. Stampa,
Iwrite on behalf of Claimants pursuant to your instruction in Procedural Order 50.

We are astonished to learn that Malaysia has resorted to referring you to the Spanish criminal
authorities for your conduct of these proceedings. We had no idea it was a crime to serve as an
arbitrator (or even, per Malaysia's misrepresentations, to pretend to serve as one).

We are likewise appalled by Mr. Portwood’s specious, melodramatic, utterly wrong and highly
offensive letter of 18 February 2022. Threatening an arbitrator in an ex parte communication
with civil and criminal liability is outrageous and an affront to all the ethical principles our
profession is supposed to hold dear. To add insult to injury, virtually every argument Mr.
Portwood advances is flatly incorrect.

Malaysia toggles between the extremes of decrying this arbitration as a transparent farce (in
which case it should have no fear of its conclusion, because enforcement and annulment
proceedings would inevitably see through it) and warning that it represents a mortal threat to
Malaysia’s territorial security.

 

Ad Hoe Arbitration
Fornan et al v Malaysia

Final Award

Neither position, of course, is anything close to the truth. As you well know, this is a commercial
dispute concerning the proper valuation of payment arising out of the 1878 Agreement, from the
time Malaysia stopped making payments in 2013, through the early 2020s. In the course of the
French proceedings, however, Mr. Portwood and company have invented a new -and fictitious-
claim that the dispute is somehow a proxy for Claimants’ true aim, to «reclaim» the State of
Sabah for themselves, at the cost of the Malaysian Federation’s integrity.

This would be amusing if it were not so serious. The assertions of Malaysia’s counsel have placed
our clients in legitimate fear for their own safety; it has led them to take measures to safeguard
their personal security. The insinuation that Claimants are fighting a proxy legal battle for
extremists who launched a violent attack on Sabah in 2013 is reckless and irresponsible.

It is also plainly wrong, as Malaysia’s own Attorney-General acknowledged in his
autobiography:

Although there appears to be no evidence of any link between the Sulu
descendants who were receiving the annual fees from Malaysia, under the 1878
Agreements [sic], and the armed invaders into Lahad Datu, the Malaysian
government ceased payments from 2013.

‘There were no legal grounds for Malaysia’s refusal to pay annually since 2013.
It resulted in Malaysia being in breach of the 1878 Agreement.

Mr. Thomas took the same position in his correspondence of 19 September 2019 (sent to me,
copied to the Sole Arbitrator, and thus part of the record of this arbitration), when he offered to
settle the matter by resuming pay ;, provided that Cl the

Clearly (and correctly), Malaysia’s Attorney-General never perceived this arbitration as in any
respect an assault on Malaysia's sovereign prerogatives.

 

  

Malaysia’s counsel have turned what its Attorney-General had conceded was a dispute over
resuming payment in a contract ~ albeit one in which the Parties disagree radically over the
quantum into a full-blown fight about the ownership of Sabah. Deluded rhetoric of this kind
not only massively misrepresents the nature of the case (as indeed Malaysia has done before the
French courts); it also exposes Claimants to a very real risk of violence, because of the volatile
part of the world where they live.

Our clients’ lives are at stake. They do not have the luxury of living in London, Paris, or Madrid,
where throwaway misrepresentations against them are mere abstractions. Allegations that blur
the otherwise-obvious distinction between this arbitration and the incursion of 2013 are
dangerous. They must stop.

Mr. Portwood’s misrep! ions concerning the current state of affairs, the
status of the various proceedings actually is as follows:

The Decision of 29 June 2021
Claimants incorporate by reference their views on the impact of the Decision of 29 June 2021 in

their letters to the Sole Arbitrator of 6 July 2021, 8 July 2021, 12 July 2021, 11 October 2021
and 25 October 2021.

 

Ad Hoe Arbitration

Final Award

Leaving aside our well-aired opinion about the manifest irregularities of the Decision of 29 June
2021, we reiterate that it does not deprive the Sole Arbitrator of his function as such. Nor, thus,
does it prevent him from concluding -as he did- that the 29 June 2021 decision constituted

interference in a Spain-based arbitration, in ion of the explicit terms
of the Spanish Law 60/2003, of 23 December, on Arbitration («Aa»), requiring and warranting
a change of seat.

 

The Decision of 29 June 2021 is currently on appeal to the Constitutional Court. Claimants
launched the appeal on 5 November 2021. As you know, there is no set timeframe for when the
Court might decide whether to hear the appeal. No other proceeding (to our knowledge) is in
prospect in respect of the decision.

 

Mr. Portwood states at p. 2 of his letter that the Superior Court of Justice of Madrid has
repeatedly reminded you that you are no longer authorized to act as arbitrator and has
expressly requested you to cease acting as arbitrator». In fact, the Superior Court of Justice of
Madrid has never ordered the Sole Arbitrator to do any such thing. It is the clerk —not the court-
who has been corresponding with the Sole Arbitrator. For the reasons explained in Claimants’
letters of 8 and 12 July 2021, any request or «order» from the clerk does not bind the Sole
Arbitrator.

The Sole Arbitrator agreed with Claimants at 4 24 of Procedural Order No. 44, of 2 November
2021:

Clerk Communication of July 7, 2021, and the Clerk Communication of July
12, 2021 lack any support in the provisions of the SAA and therefore can be
categorized as an unauthorised local-court intrusion on this ongoing
arbitration process, in breach of the principle of judicial non-interference
recognised by Article 7 of the SAa, the New York Convention and the Geneva
Convention —both ratified by Spain- and by international and domestic judicial
case law. These provisions leave no room for national courts to supervise or
regulate the arbitrator's procedural decisions during an ongoing arbitration...

Mr. Portwood and the clerk appear to share an affinity for ex parte communications, as well as
an unfortunate tendency to mischaracterize court decisions. Mr. Portwood’s misrepresentations
thus come as no surprise.

The Preliminary Award

There has never been any suggestion that the Preliminary Award was rendered contrary to the
letter or spirit of the original court decision appointing the Sole Arbitrator. Recall that
Malaysia’s Attorney-General wrote to me and you on 19 September and 14 October 2019; the
Attorney-General was clear that his letters should not be taken to imply his acceptance of either
the Spanish courts’ or the Sole Arbitrator’s jurisdiction over the dispute, but at no point then or
thereafter did he allege any misconduct or irregularity in relation to the Sole Arbitrator’s
rendering of the Preliminary Award.

 

Likewise, during Herbert Smith Freehills’ brief foray into the arbitration in late 2019, there was
much discussion of the Sole Arbitrator’s jurisdiction or lack thereof, but no mention of any
impropriety in respect of the pursuit of his court-certified appointment. If there had been any
such concern, one would imagine Herbert Smith Freehills would have raised it. To the contrary,
the Sole Arbitrator provided the courtesy (and then some) of extending the procedural schedule
on the jurisdiction phase by nine whole months to accommodate Malaysia's ostensible new
counsel.

Final Award

Malaysia’s only argument concerning the illegitimacy of the Preliminary Award therefore rests
on its assertion that the Decision of 29 June 2021 (issued more than a year after the Preliminary
Award) unwound everything that the Sole Arbitrator had done previously. The Sole Arbitrator
has already rejected that contention in Procedural Orders 42 and 44; therefore, there is no extant
point of argument concerning the legitimacy of the Preliminary Award.

As explained in Claimants’ letter to the Sole Arbitrator of 25 October 2021, the Preliminary
Award has not been, and will not be, annulled in Spain. Indeed, the Decreto issued by the clerk
on 14 October 2021 states, in relation to the vacatur of the Preliminary Award, «acuerda el
archivo del presente procedimiento, por carencia de objeto, y sin imposicién de costas a las
partes». Neither party appealed the Decreto.

Hence, the Preliminary Award has not been vacated by a Spanish Court and therefore remains

in full force.

The uatur of the Preliminary Award

 

Mr. Portwood’s hyperbolic description of the French proceedings completely distorts the reality.
Claimants’ counsel, first of all, are not violating the stay of the Exequatur by responding to the
Sole Arbitrator’s invitation to comment on it (what an absurd allegation!).

Second, the stay of the Exequatur has no bearing on the Sole Arbitrator’s right -and duty- to
conclude proceedings with a Final Award. This is a point we have already litigated and the
Sole Arbitrator decided in Procedural Order 49.

Contrary to Mr. Portwood’s assertion, the date for the appeal of the Exequatur has not been
finalised. Claimants consider that no procedural calendar has been validly set for the time being
in the appeal proceedings of the Exequatur Order; a procedural hearing is set for 28 February
2021 [corrected, 2022], during which the judge and the parties will discuss the schedule.

As for Mr. Portwood’s
French law and liable to civil penalty in France by rendering a Final Award, this is a complete

 

scurrilous suggestion that the Sole Arbitrator would be in violation of

 

misrepresentation. Even overlooking the fact that Mr. Portwood’s communication is based on
contested legal and factual issues before the French Courts in the pending proceedings, and that
Malaysia’s Counsel has misleadingly presented the same contested issues as established facts,
Mr. Portwood’s ex parte communication to the Sole Arbitrator is unfounded as a matter of
French law.

According to case law that has been settled and applied consistently for decades (inter alia, since
the French Supreme Court decisiol
under French law are «decisions of international justice». They are not integrated into the legal

    

in the Hilmarton and Putrabali cases), arbitral awards

system of any State and can only be subject to review pursuant to the rules in force in the country
where recognition or enforcement is sought, in the context of recognition or exequatur
proceedings.

Consequently, and further to our correspondence of 22 December 2021, neither the
recognition/exequatur of the Preliminary Award pursuant to the Exequatur Order by the
French Courts, nor the order purportedly staying the effects of the same, nor the appeal brought
by Malaysia before the Paris Court of Appeal, nor any decision rendered by Spanish courts, can
affect pending arbitration proceedings, or the Sole’s Arbitrator’s duty to conduct those
proceedings diligently and expeditiously through to the Final Award.

Consistent with the above, it is a fundamental principle of the French legal order that French
courts lack jurisdiction and/or power to interfere with arbitratio:

 

;, including inter alia to order

 

Ad Hoe Arbitration
Fornan et al v Malaysia

Final Award

an arbitral tribunal to suspend any such ongoing proceedings. In respect, the Paris Court of
Appeal has ruled that anti-arbitration injunctive measures are contrary to international public
policy and cannot be recognized in the French legal order.

For the same reason, the Sole Arbitrator cannot incur any criminal or civil liability whatsoever
under French law for diligently discharging his duties as to the conduct of the proceedings. This
is true both where non-French decisions purportedly set aside an arbitral award previously
rendered in the same arbitration, and where parties seize French courts to deny or frustrate the
arbitration’s exequatur.

Mr. Portwood’s assertion is therefore wholly incorrect: not only is there no rule of French law
that the Sole Arbitrator could possibly violate by rendering a Final Award, nor any provision
that could impose civil penalties upon him for doing so; but also, more fundamentally, the
imposition of any such liability would be fundamentally antithetical to the French philosophy
of arbitration.

 

Criminal Proceedings in Spain Against the Sole Arbitrator

 

We reiterate our bafflement upon learning that Malaysia has prompted a criminal investigation
against the Sole Arbitrator in Spain. Claimants note that «no further particulars are known to
the Arbitrator in this regard».

While we reserve our right to comment on the criminal investigation if and when further
information emerges, Claimants are unaware of any provision of the Spanish Criminal Code
that the Sole Arbitrator could possibility have violated in the conduct of these proceedings.
Serving as arbitrator is not a crime. Moreover, there is no obligation in Spain to stay or
spend an arbitration p ing in light of a ially related satellite criminal

 

 

 

 

investigation.

Jn nearly 25 years of practice on matters domestic and international, civil and criminal, I regret
to state that I have never d_ more hostile, vexatious, and desp

behaviour from a litigant and its counsel. Malaysia veered long ago off the course of vigorous
advocacy for its case into outright intimidation and falsehood. Malaysia’s recourse to the
criminal authorities in Spain and Mr. Portwood’s letter epitomize Malaysia’s willingness to
abandon all standards of legal practice and ethics.

 

 

As we have said many times before, Malaysia has every right to challenge the Sole Arbitrator’s
decisions and Awards, even if it chooses not to participate in the arbitral proceedings. But to
endanger the other side’s safety by equating a commercial dispute with an armed incursion is
reckless endangerment.

 

not lawyering — it is

 

Likewise, to posit that the proper -or even the improper- assertion of an arbitrator's role is
somehow a matter of criminal culpability is as reprehensible as it is nonsensical. It goes against
every established principle of arbitral immunity and all the canons and customs of
international law.

Portwood’s letter of earlier today (yet again rendered ex parte) recycles the unfounded and
unethical threats made to the Sole Arbitrator in Mr. Portwood’s prior correspondence. There is
nothing new in his latest letter. Given that Mr. Portwood’s threats, as discussed herein, are
utterly empty, and that he has pointedly declined to provide a letter of representation for this
arbitration, we find no basis for further comment. Likewise, the Sole Arbitrator should ignore

 

Ad Hoe Arbitration
Fornan et al v Malaysia

Final Award

all further communications from Mr. Portwood, as they are full of sound and fury, signifying
nothing.

For the reasons set forth above, the Sole Arbitrator should ignore these latest, and most
shameful, efforts to deter him from fulfilling his function on or before 1 March 2022. Enough is
enough.

Respectfully...».

154. Having considered the Parties’ arguments carefully, the Arbitrator rejected
the Respondent’s request and proceedings continued as planned. !24

5. Respondent’s Refusal to Participate in the Arbitration

155. It is the Arbitrator’s view that both due process and equality of arms of the
Parties have been duly respected throughout this arbitration.!25

156. Claimants were properly served with all submissions, procedural steps and
requests; were aware of their content, acknowledged receipt in a timely fashion and
participated throughout the proceedings.

157. Respondent was given an equal, fair and reasonable opportunity to present its
case to the Arbitrator throughout this arbitration. Respondent refused to participate, nor
intervene —directly or by proxy- in the arbitration, except for the period from October 25,
2019 until November 18, 2019 and Mr. Capiel’s Motion. The Arbitrator notes that
Respondent finally admits that it was properly served with all submissions, procedural
steps, notices, documents and requests in connection with the arbitration, sent to its
official address.!26 Respondent also admits that it was summoned to the hearings held in
these proceedings and was aware of their contents.!27

In the ex parte communication of December 17, 2021, Respondent’s representative, Mr.
Portwood, admitted that «... Malaysia chose not to participate in the arbitral proceedings
because of, inter alia, (a) the irregularity of the appointment of the Sole Arbitrator (see
infra, § 23) and (b) the serious infringement of its immunity from jurisdiction resulting

from the initiation of arbitral proceedings against it (i) without its consent to the arbitration
(the 1878 Agreement does not contain an arbitration clause) and (ii) to hear claims that
would challenge its sovereignty over its own territory (see supra, §§ 10-13). It thus indicated
that it was challenging the arbitration proceedings in their entirety...».128

Mr. Portwood also stated that «...nothing in this correspondence or in the suspension order
should be construed as participation in or acknowledgement by Malaysia of the legitimacy
of the proceeding or any of the decisions and orders rendered by you in the proceedings,
including the purported change of the arbitral seat to Paris, France...».129

Respondent was aware of the consequences of its non-participation, as it had been
repeatedly warned and informed throughout the arbitration, that notwithstanding having
been given such opportunity to do so, the Arbitrator might proceed with arbitration as
scheduled and that both the Preliminary Award and the Final Award are binding and
legally enforceable against Respondent.

158. Respondent’s non-appearance will not be treated as an automatic admission
of Claimants’ assertions and relief sought on the substantive issues of this dispute. 3!
Before doing so, the Arbitrator needs to satisfy himself the Claimants’ arguments are well
founded in fact and law and Claimants —as appearing party- are entitled to obtain the
relief they sought in this arbitration.

V. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND ON THE MERITS

159. This Section of the Final Award summarizes the essential characteristics of
the claim as set out in the Notice of Arbitration, in the Counter — Memorial on Jurisdiction,
in the Statement of Claim and in some written submissions from Respondent and as
resulted from the evidence on these disputed issues gathered throughout this substantive
phase of the arbitration, as presented by the Parties to the Arbitrator.

The relevant documents were contained both in the Exhibits for Claimants and,
eventually, in those for Respondent; reference is made to both where necessary.

Most of these materials to which the Parties referred in their pleadings in this arbitration
are historic in nature and contained in archives for public and unrestricted access. It is
the Arbitrator’s view that the Parties’ right to be heard and the principle of their equal
treatment were observed because the Parties referred —directly and indirectly- to these
exhibits in their pleadings and therefore it must be presumed —unless otherwise stated-
that the Parties were familiar with their contents.

Within these boundaries, the contents of these materials will be complemented in the
Final Award, where necessary, by those other related and which consultation may be
eventually recommended for the proper assessment of the present dispute. Additional
facts will be discussed in the Arbitrator’s analysis of the disputed issues, to the extent they
are relevant and useful.

160. Sultan Mohammed Jamalul Alam and Messrs. Alfred Dent and Baron

161. Mr. Dent applied for a Royal Charter from the British Government on
December 2, 1878. In July 1880, Mr. Dent and his partners established the British North
Borneo Provisional Association, a British commercial syndicate which «...consists of
persons who lately agreed to join together for the temporary purposes of acting as
intermediaries between the Petitioner Alfred Dent, on the one hand, and a company to be
incorporated (if We should so think fit) by Royal Charter, on the other hand, and of carrying
out until the grant of such a Charter the management of the affairs arising...»° under the
management of the 1878 Agreement. Mr. Overbeck relinquished all his rights and
interests in the affair to Mr. Dent on September 1, 1880, leaving Mr. Dent in control.1*6

162. On November 1, 1881, the British Gladstone Government granted the Royal
Charter and the British North Borneo Company was incorporated.!37 The British North
Borneo Provisional Association Limited was dissolved and restructured itself as the

Agreement.!*9 The British North Borneo Company was authorised and empowered to
assume the management of the territory delimited on the 1878 Agreement,'° under the
conditions provided by the Royal Charter.

163. The granting of the Royal Charter created concerns with both the Spanish and
Dutch authorities, as it might overlap other relevant colonial spheres of influence already
existing in the Indian Archipelago: the Spanish Government of the Philippines and the
Netherlands Indian Government.'4!

164. The Netherlands, alarmed with the granting of the Charter, sought to protect
their existing colonial possessions in the region from Great Britain.'42 In September 1879,
a landing party of a Dutch gunboat hoisted the Netherlands flag well within the territory
of North Borneo and initiated a dispute on the determination of its north-eastern
boundary. !* After diplomatic exchanges, the Netherlands Government complained in
August 1881 before the British Government of the political power to be exercised by the
British Government over the affairs of the British North Borneo Company. On November
21, 1881, the Right Honourable Earl Granville —Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in
Gladstone’s Second Government of the United Kingdom- sent a note to the Netherlands
Government clarifying that «...the territories ceded to Mr. Dent will be administered by the
Company under the suzerainty of the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, to whom they have
agreed to pay a yearly tribute. The British Government assumes no sovereign rights
whatever in Borneo...”.144 The Boundary Treaty of June 20, 1891, entered into between the
Netherlands and Britain, had the express purpose of delimiting the land boundary
between North Borneo and the Dutch territories in Borneo.

165. Spain was also worried about British expansion in North Borneo. The basis
for its claim on Borneo was based on the terms of the Treaty signed on April 19, 1851
(henceforth, the 1851 Treaty), which codified peace terms between Spain and the
Sultanate of Sulu as a consequence of the Spanish expedition initiated on December 11,
1850 against Sulu for the suffocation of an internal revolt in that area.14°

Final Award

The 1851 Treaty contained the Act of Incorporation of the Sultanate of Sulu with the
Spanish Crown, where the Sultanate of Sulu admitted vassalage to Spain. Under its
Article 3, the signatories declared that «...all treaties made with other powers to be null
and void if they are prejudicial to the ancient and indisputable rights held by Spain over
the entire Sulu Archipelago as part of the Philippine Islands, and they ratify, renew and
leave in force all documents containing clauses favourable to the Spanish Government that
may have been drawn up before this date, however old they may be...». Spain and the
Sultanate of Sulu signed and sealed the 1851 Treaty, with its complete and exact
translations into Spanish and Sulu.

The effect of the 1851 Treaty was temporary, as it was not immediately acknowledged by
Britain.™¢ It also created an ambiguous situation for Spain; it would be willing to defend
before the international system its rights over Borneo and the Sulu Archipelago, but it
would only deploy its military forces in the protection and preservation of the latter, in
fear of otherwise creating an international conflict. In fact, Spain perceived the granting
of the Charter as a confirmation of the emergence of a potential British sphere of influence
in North Borneo, which might affect political jurisdiction between Spain and Great
Britain.

However, the absence of the desired internal consensus, along with its weakness in the
international arena, led Spain to cede its rights to the designs of the great commercial
powers in that region. Further to the conversations held between 1881 and 1882 in London
and Berlin to overcome these differences, Spain, Germany and Great Britain finally signed
a protocol in Madrid on March 7, 1885 (henceforth, the 1885 Madrid Protocol),!47 where
the latter two nations recognised both the undisputed sovereignty of Spain over the Sulu
Archipelago and the limits of its influence on the region. Under its Article III, Spain
relinquished all claims to Borneo and adjacent islands and renounced, as far as regarded
the British government, all claims of sovereignty over the territories of the continent of
Borneo which have belonged in the past to the Sultan of Sulu and «...which form part of
the territories administered by the Company styled the British North Borneo Company...”
delimited in the 1878 Agreement and in the Royal Charter.!48

The Government of the United Kingdom sought to forestall any further claims from
Germany and France derived from their interest in the Asian region and to finalize the
prevailing anarchy in Brunei. Great Britain achieved this twofold object on May 12, 1888,
when the Government of the United Kingdom and the British North Borneo Company
signed a protectorate agreement for the territory delimited in the 1878 Agreement —to be
officially referred to from then on as the State of North Borneo until 1946- to become a

Agreement, the British North Borneo Company came under the protection of Great
Britain. Thus, the British North Borneo Company would continue to manage the territory
without inferences and could call upon the support of the Royal Navy and the British Army
should any European power have attempted to or seized control over the territory."

166. On April 22, 1903, the Sultan of Sulu and the British North Borneo Company
concluded the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, in which the names of a certain number of islands
were to be treated as having been included in the 1878 Agreement were specified.!*! The
1903 Confirmatory Deed added 300 dollars to the annual rental of 5,000 dollars provided
by the 1878 Agreement, paid retroactively.

167. On March 21, 1904, the United States of America unilaterally abrogated the
agreement known as the Bates Treaty, because its conditions were not complied with.!*?
Following this abrogation, on March 22, 1915, Mr. Frank W. Carpenter —acting as the
North American Governor-General and representative of the government of the United
States of America of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu- and the Sultan of Sulu signed
a mutual understanding (henceforth, the Carpenter — Kiram Agreement).!°*

The Carpenter — Kiram Agreement instrumented the Sultan’s recognition as the
ecclesiastical or spiritual head of the Sulu Mohammedans in consideration of the
agreement of the Sultan of Sulu to relinquish its temporal powers over Sulu. In his letter
of May 4, 1920, addressed to the Director of Non-Christian Tribes, Mr. Carpenter stressed
that the sovereignty of the Sultan of Sulu over the Sultanate of Sulu remained and was
not affected by the Carpenter — Kiram Agreement.!*4

The Sultanate of Sulu was understood to be held under lease by the British North Borneo
Company.!**

169. The British North Borneo Company administered the territory until the
Japanese occupation in January 1942. On September 10, 1945, Lieutenant General Masao
Baba, Supreme Commander of the 37'* Japanese Army in Borneo, was escorted by
Australian Soldiers of the 9" Division of the Australian Imperial Forces to the Surrender
Point in Labuan, where he capitulated the forces under his command and signed the
Instrument of Surrender before Major General George Frederick Wootten CB CBE Dso,
General Officer Commanding the 9» Division of the Australian Imperial Forces.1°?

170. Immediately after the liberation of North Borneo, the British North Borneo
Company faced the reconstruction of a devastated area’® and decided to relinquish its
ownership —defined as «...all the...properties and assets as they exist on the fifteenth day

June 26, 1946, the British North Borneo Company assigned all its rights and assets in
North Borneo to the British Crown effective July 15, 1946 and North Borneo thereby
changed its status from that of a British Protectorate —as established in the Protectorate
Agreement- to a British Crown Colony (henceforth, the 1946 North Borneo Cession
Agreement).!62

173. Preceded by high level meetings and discussions started on May 27, 1961, the
proposal to create a Federation of Malaysia —which would embrace the Federation of
Malaya, Singapore, North Borneo, Sarawak and Brunei- was considered a desirable aim.
During the meeting of July 23, 1961, of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association
Branch of Malaya and Borneo, held in Singapore, it was agreed to establish the Malaysia
Solidarity Consultative Committee.

On February 3, 1962, the Committee rendered a Memorandum on Malaysia, submitted for
consideration by the Commission of Enquiry, North Borneo and Sarawak, known as the
Cobbold Commission (henceforth, the Cobbold Commission).

The Cobbold Commission issued a Report on June 21, 1962, which unanimously agreed
that a Federation of Malaysia was in the best interest of North Borneo (henceforth, the
Cobbold Report). The proposal of the Cobbold Report was that the Federation should be
brought into being by August 31, 1963.16

VI. PARTIES’ POSITIONS AND RELIEF REQUESTED ON THE MERITS

180. The Arbitrator will summarize Parties’ respective positions, before setting out
the reasons for his decision. For the avoidance of any doubt, the Arbitrator has considered
the entirety of Parties’ submissions on record; its summary is not meant to be exhaustive.

181. In the Notice of Arbitration, Claimants’ position in this arbitration is formally
pleaded as follows:17!

«...The Claimants respectfully request that the Sole Arbitrator issue an Award in the following
terms:

(i) Declaring that the Respondent has breached the 1878 Lease Agreement;

(ii) Ordering (a) the Respondent to pay the Claimants damages that more fairly and
accurately reflect the value of the 1878 Lease Agreement from the year of Malaysia's
breach (2018) through the date of the award; and (b) the rebalancing of the 1878 Lease
Agreement for prospective revenues;

(iii) In the alternative, if the Sole Arbitrator chooses not to rebalance the 1878 Lease
Agreement, an award ordering (a) the termination thereof and (b) the Respondent to
pay damages to the Claimants;

(iv) Ordering the Respondent to pay pre-award and post-award interest on any and all
damages awarded to the Claimants;

(v) Ordering the Respondent to pay all of the Claimants’ costs of this arbitration and pay
post-award interest on these amounts; and

(vi) Ordering any and all other relief that the Sole Arbitrator deems appropriate...».

182. Respondent’s substantive position in this arbitration is contained in its letter
of September 19, 2019, and pleaded as follows:!72

«...2. It is vital at the outset to appreciate the legal basis of your clients’ claim against the
Government of Malaysia...

8. That legal basis arises from a Grant by Sultan of Sulu of Territories and Lands on the
Mainland of the Island of Borneo dated 22" January 1878 (1878 Grant) issued by the Sultan
of Sulu to a British Company acting through its representatives Gustavus Baron de Overbeck
of Hong Kong and Mr. Alfred Dent Esquire of London, whereby the Sultan of Sulu granted and
ceded to the British Company «for ever and in perpetuity all the rights and powers» belonging
to the Sultan of Sulu, territories and land in the island of Borneo specified in the said Grant to
the British Company, in consideration of «the sum of five thousand dollars per annum».

4... the British Company can only transfer the territories and lands concerned upon «the
sanction of Her Britannic Majesty's Government first being obtained»...

5. On the same day the Grant was issued (22"4 January 1878) the Sultan of Sulu also issued a
Commission appointing Baron de Overbeck (the chief and only authorized representative of the
Company in Borneo) to be the Datu Bandahara and Rajah of Sandakan. Upon the death or
retirement from office of Baron de Overbeck, the British Company was empowered to appoint
others to the office of Datu Bandahara and Rajah of Sandakan.

6. Over time, obviously the contracting parties changed. Upon the establishment of Malaysia on
16% September 1968, Malaysia became the successor-in-title to the British Company viz. the
British North Borneo Company under the 1878 Grant and Confirmation by Sultan of Sulu of
Cession of Certain Islands dated 22nd April 1903 (1903 Confirmation of Cession). From 1963
to 2012, that is, for an unbroken and continuous period of 49 years, Malaysia had been, under
the 1878 Grant, paying your clients (themselves the successors-in-title to the Sultan of Sulu) the
annual sum 5300 dollars. The payment was increased by 300 dollars per annum by way of the
1903 Confirmation of Cess

  

7. From the beginning, Malaysia paid to your clients the agreed annual sum (Cession Monies)
of 5300 dollars in Malaysian Ringgit, that is, 5300 Myr. The payment of Cession Monies had
been made to the rightful heirs of the Sulu Sultanate, consistent with the judgment delivered
Chief Justice C.F.C Macaskie in 18 December 1939 in the High Court of the State of North
Borneo in the case Dayang — Dyang Haji Piandao Kiram of Jolo, Philippines & 8 others v. The
Government of North Borneo & Others [Civil Suit No 169/39]. That judgment declared that the
Plaintiffs are the rightful heirs with the right over the Cessions Monies. The grounds of
judgment are attached hereto as Annexure A.‘

 

8. Malaysia had continuously paid the Cession Monies to the heirs of the Sulu Sultanate
through their appointed attorney Ulka T. Ulama until 2010. For the years 2011 and 2012, the
Cession Monies were paid directly to the heirs of the Sulu Sultanate and not through their
appointed attorney as the Ambassador of Malaysia to the Republic of the Philippines had
received complaints from the heirs to the Sulu Sultanate on the delay of payments made
previously and costs charged by the attorney for such services. Due to these complaints, the
Ambassador of Malaysia to the Republic of Philippines decided to make payment directly to the
heirs of the Sulu Sultanate. The payment of the Cession Monies were made in Philippine Peso
based on the prevailing exchange rates. A copy of letter dated 28 June 2012 from the
Ambassador of Malaysia to the heirs of the Sulu Sultanate concerning the aforesaid payment is
attached as Annexure B.

 

9. Regrettably, payments ceased in 2013. Malaysia is now ready and willing to pay your clients
all arrears from 2013 to 2019, and agrees to fully comply with the 1878 Grant and the 1903
Confirmation of Cession from henceforth with regards to future payments. As to the arrears,
Malaysia is also agreeable to paying simple interest of 10% p.a. on the annual payments for
each of the years concerned, as stated in the Table below:

 

 

Year Arrears (Malysian Ringgit) 10% interest
20138 3,180.00 (6 years)

therefore expect your clients to discontinue all proceedings they have instituted in Spain (or

183. In the Statement of Claim, Claimants’ substantive position in this arbitration
is formally pleaded as follows:!™4

«...590. Claimants had hoped to settle this dispute amicably; they tried for decades to negotiate
in good faith for a change in the terms of the 1878 Lease Agreement. It was to no avail.
Claimants nonetheless anticipate dedicating a substantial portion of any monies received to a
fund for the enrichment of the region that spanned the old Sultanate of Sulu — a region that,
despite its wealth in natural resources, has found itself impoverished from colonial times to this
day.

591. Claimants, in sum, seek redress for the manifest unfairness of the situation into which the
Malaysian Government has placed them. They pray that they can find it through this
proceeding. And they hope for the realization of the words of Martin Luther King: «The moral
arc of the universe is long, but it bends toward justice».

592. The Claimants accordingly request that the Sole Arbitrator issue an award:

(i) Declaring that the 1878 Lease Agreement is a lease;

(ii) Declaring Malaysia in breach of the 1878 Lease Agreement;
(iii) Declaring the 1878 Lease Agreement terminated, and:

a. if terminated as of 1 January 2018, ordering Malaysia to pay Claimants the
restitution value of the rights over the Leased Territories as of that day,
reflected at § V.F above; or

b. if terminated as of February 2020 or later, ordering Malaysia to pay
Claimants the restitution value of the rights over the Leased Territories as of
that termination date, reflected at § V.F above, plus non-performance
damages for the (adapted or rebalanced) unpaid rent from 2013 to the date of

termination of the 1878 Lease Agreement, reflected at § V.F above (currently

(iv) Alternatively, if the Sole Arbitrator does not terminate the 1878 Lease Agreement,

a. alump sum for the (adapted or rebalanced) unpaid rent from 2013 to the date

b. all future annual rent payments in the adapted or rebalanced amount
reflected at § V.F above;

(v) Ordering Malaysia to pay all Claimants’ costs in this arbitration;

(vi) Ordering Malaysia to pay pre-award and post-award interest on any and all amounts
awarded to Claimants, except for the award on costs, which should accrue post-award
interest only; and

(vii) Ordering any and all other relief that the Sole Arbitrator deems appropriate...».

184. In the Reply, Claimants portrayed their position as follows:

«...2. As the Sole Arbitrator knows, Malaysia was due to submit its Statement of Defence on 20
August 2020.1 Malaysia did not do so. The Sole Arbitrator accordingly extended Malaysia's
deadline to submit a Statement of Defence until 1 September 2020.2 Again, Malaysia failed to
make a submi

 

8. As with a Redfern Schedule -where Malaysia likewise declined to engage- Claimants see no
point wasting the Sole Arbitrator’s time with a Reply in a vacuum. The Procedural Calendar
calls for Claimants to respond to Malaysia’s contentions; there are no such contentions to which
to respond.

4, As before, should Malaysia eventually deign to engage in these proceedings, and should the
Sole Arbitrator indulge any desire Malaysia might have to submit a grossly untimely Statement
of Defence, Claimants reserve their right to issue a more fulsome Reply accordingly...».

185. The Arbitrator has had the benefit of some written submissions from
Respondent and of extensive written and oral submissions from the Claimants, both in
relation to the substantive issues presented. The Arbitrator has carefully considered all
these submissions and refers to their central point in the next Section of the Final Award.

VII. THE ARBITRATOR’S ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS ON THE MERITS

1. The Legal Characterisation of the 1878 Agreement and of the 1903 Confirmatory
Deed

i. The Parties’ Positions

186. Claimants characterise the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed
as a commercial transaction, a leasing agreement of certain territory along the North
Coast of Borneo, constituted for an undetermined period with Malaysia and on which the
Sultan remained sovereign.!

187. Respondent denies Claimants’ position. It affirms that, jointly considered, the
1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed would constitute an instrument for the
permanent cession of territorial sovereignty over certain territories of North Borneo by
the Sultan in favour of both Messrs. Alfred Dent and Baron Gustavus de Overbeck.
Therefore, in the Respondent’s opinion, the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory
Deed would affect Malaysia’s sovereignty and, as such, the Respondent would challenge
its substantive arbitrability.!7°

ii. The Arbitrator’s Analysis and Findings

188. The core of the Parties’ debate on the legal characterisation of both the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed is to ascertain whether their terms and
conditions (i) could imply the cession by the Sultanate of Sulu of its sovereignty or its
sovereign title to the territories defined therein —i.e., North Borneo and adjacent islands-
in favour of both Mr. Alfred Dent and Baron Gustavus de Overbeck or, to the contrary, (ii)
were to be considered as a simple commercial lease of these territories in favour of Messrs.
Alfred Dent and Baron Gustavus de Overbeck, with a perpetual duration and an annual
rental.

A. The 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed: Invalid Instruments Under
International Law of Permanent Cession of Territorial Sovereignty over the Mainland of
North Borneo and its Adjacent Islands

189. Malaysia purports to present the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory
Deed as an instrument for the permanent cession by the Sultan of Sulu of territorial
sovereignty over certain territories of North Borneo in favour of both Messrs. Dent and
Overbeck. !77 It is Respondent’s view that both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed would affect Malaysia’s sovereignty and, as such, Respondent would
challenge its substantive arbitrability. Respondent failed to develop its assertion further
in this arbitration. The allegations contained in the Suspension Order Request and in
Exhibit C 114 are not supported by any evidence. The Arbitrator carefully considered
Respondent's position in this issue, as it could affect the present arbitration, and reached
the conclusion of the inaccuracy of the Respondent’s assertion, for the reasons which are
explained below.

190. The Sultanate of Sulu, founded in 1457, existed as international legal person
prior to the signature of both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed. The
1851 Treaty so demonstrates, as it was entered into by Spain and the Sultanate of Sulu,
both acting as two sovereign countries, independent from each other.!7*

191. The wording of the 1878 Agreement clearly identifies «...His Majesty and Lord
the Sultan Muhammad Jamalul Azam, son of the late Majesty the Sultan Muhammad
Fadlu, Sultan of the State of Sulu...», as the signatory of the 1878 Agreement, on the part
of and on behalf of the Sultanate of Sulu.

192. The wording of the 1878 Agreement highlights that, on the other part, Mr.
Alfred Dent and Baron Gustavus de Overbeck jointly acted therein as private individuals,
representing private commercial interests. The phrasing is clear: «...Mr Gustavus Baron
de Overbeck, resident of Hong Kong, and to Alfred Dent Esquire, resident of London,
representing a British company...”. The evidence available in the proceedings ratify the
correctness of this conclusion.

On January 2, 1878, Acting Consul — General, Mr. William Hood Treacher, KCMG, sent a
letter to the Earl of Derby, reporting on the activities of Baron Gustavus de Overbeck,
when he arrived at Labuan. It is dated two days prior to the signature of the 1878

Agreement. Mr. Treacher identified Messrs. Dent and Overbeck as private businessmen
and portrayed them as follows:!79

«..Baron Gustavus de Overbeck, an Austrian, and Consul-General (unpaid) for Austria-
Hungary at Hong Kong, where he has been long resident as a merchant, having previously, I
am informed, been manager in the house of Dent and Co. of Shangae...

Baron de Overbeck...was acting in conjunction with Mr. Alfred Dent, a member of the well-
known British firm of Dent and Co., who, indeed, had the principal interest in the scheme; that

the main desire being to develop the agricultural resources of the northern portion of Borneo,
which, as your Lordship is aware, is considered to be the most fertile part of the island, and
well adapted for the cultivation of sugar, pepper, gambier, and coffee, its hills affording at
different altitudes the various degrees of temperature requisite...».

On January 22, 1878, Mr. Treacher sent a letter to the Earl of Derby, explaining that!®°

«...the Sultan did me the honour of consulting me on the subject of the Baro
told him that any advice I gave would be given in the capacity of a friend of His Highness and
would bear no official weight, as I had received no instructions from your Lordship in the
matter. I Informed him that, to the best of my belief, the Baron represented a bona fide British
Company or co-partnership with sufficient capital or the capacity of raising it, to carry out an
undertaking of this kind...

request, and I

 

On signing the 1878 Agreement, Mr. Dent confirmed to his brother, Mr. Edward Dent, in
a letter dated February 18, 1878, his condition of private businessman in the following
terms: «...We can ask anybody to put money into mortgages in a Crown Colony, but this
Borneo scheme is a matter for us to take up as merchants not as investors...».!81

The grant of the Royal Charter of the British North Borneo Company —dated November 1,
1881- recorded that:!*?

«...an humble Petition has been presented to us in Our Council by Alfred Dent, of 11, Old Street,

Most Honurable Order of the Bath, a Rear-Admiral in Our Navy; and William Henry Macleod

Company...». This British Company to which Malaysia refers was the British North
Borneo Provisional Association Limited, later known as the British North Borneo
Company (see Section V of this Final Award). In § 3 of the Respondent’s letter of
September 19, 2019!8°, Respondent admitted that the «.../egal basis arises from a Grant
by Sultan of Sulu of Territories and Lands on the Mainland of the Island of Borneo dated
22nd January 1878 (1878 Grant) issued by the Sultan of Sulu to a British Company acting
through its representatives Gustavus Baron de Overbeck of Hong Kong and Mr. Alfred Dent
Esquire of London...»

On September 19, 2019, Malaysia also admitted that it became the successor-in-title of
the British North Borneo Company under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed upon the establishment of its Federation on September 16, 1963.!*4

193. Malaysia seems to sustain that both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed would be characterised as international treaties, as they are the only
valid instruments to articulate the alleged cession of territorial sovereignty in
international law. Respondent’s assertion and assumption imply the analysis of this
question from the perspective of international law, which operation is limited in two
dimensions: place and time.

194. The principle of contemporaneity applies to treaty interpretation and,
consequently, examines the parties’ intentions and the relevant circumstances that
occurred at the treaty’s conclusion.

When it comes, as occurs in the present case with Respondent, to the analysis of the
alleged acquisition of territorial sovereignty of North Borneo though cession —one of the
five acquisition methods recognised in international law-'** the application of the general
principle of intertemporal law should also guide the examination of the disputed question.
This principle provides that the effect of a juridical fact must be determined according to
the law contemporary with it, and not of the law in force at the time when a dispute about
it arises or fails to be settled.

The result of this assessment, in conjunction with these general principles of international
law, the evidence available in this arbitration and the circumstances of the case, must
allow the Arbitrator to establish the title -if any- by which territorial sovereignty over
North Borneo would have been validly acquired at a certain moment by Messrs. Dent and
Overbeck. This critical date provides a definite point at which sovereignty is to be finally

determined; in the case at hand, January 4, 1878, the date of the signature of the 1878
Agreement. The Arbitrator should also be satisfied that this territorial sovereignty did
exist at the critical date and that, once acquired, this territorial sovereignty has continued
to exist in favour of Messrs. Dent and Overbeck, as Respondent alleges.

195. The evidence available in the proceeding shows that the Sultanate of Sulu met
all the criteria for statehood and sovereignty. It had a permanent population, it had a
defined territory, it had a government, and it had the capacity to enter into diplomatic
relations. !86 But the Sultanate of Sulu lacked any written enacted legislation on
international treaties at the time of the signature of the 1878 Agreement. In the absence
of this legislation, the Arbitrator will also examine the surrounding circumstances.

196. Territory is a tangible attribute of statehood and, within that particular
geographical area which it occupies, a state enjoys and exercises sovereignty. As a land,
the territory is the place where the imperium is exercised, whereas, as a good, it can be
subject to appropriation and to the exercise of dominium.

197. The concept of sovereignty, a more complex term, is the most fundamental
principle of international law because nearly all international relations are bound up with
sovereignty of States. It has a threefold aspect: the external sovereignty, the internal
sovereignty and the territorial sovereignty.

The external sovereignty —also known as independence- is the right of the State freely to
determine its relations with other States or other entities without the restraint or control
of another State.

The internal aspect of sovereignty is the State’s exclusive right or competence to determine
the character of its own institutions, to ensure and provide for their operation, to enact
laws of its own choice and ensure their respect.

Territorial sovereignty is one of the most important rules of international law, as it
represents the nexus between the State and its territory. It encompasses the complete and
exclusive authority which a State exercises over all persons and things found on, under or
above its territory. It may thus be defined as the right to exercise therein the functions of
a State, to the exclusion of any other State.

198. It is the Arbitrator’s view that the result of the evidence in this arbitration
demonstrates (i) that the behaviour of the British Government from 1878 until its

signature of the Protectorate Agreement (1888) indicated that it rejected any pretensions
to sovereignty over North Borneo and its adjacent islands and (ii) that the behaviour of
Mr. Dent, of the British North Borneo Company and some others, even into the twentieth
century, suggested that they believed the Sultan of Sulu still to be sovereign.

In his letter of January 2, 1878, Mr. Treacher admitted, in relation to the 1878 Agreement,
that

«...The concessions obtained by Messrs. Overbeck and Dent include the whole northern portion
of Borneo from the River Sulaman on the west to the River Sibuco on the east, and, to the south
of Sulaman, the harbours and coasts of Gaya and Sapangar, the districts of Pappar, Benoni,
and Kimanis in the near vicinity of Labuan... The remaining territory mentioned in the grants
is actually under Sulu rule, and occupied by Sulu Chiefs, and it was only because the districts

were mentioned in the original American grants that they are again included, and Mr. Overbeck
187

 

will now have to make a separate Agreement with the Sultan of Sulu for them...

 

Mr. Dent wrote a letter to his brother, Mr. Edward Dent, on February 18, 1878,
interpreting the conduct of the Sultan of Sulu: «...it looks as if the Sultan (of Soloo)
retained some of his old rights over that part of the country...».188 Mr. Dent further
pencilled his perception in his correspondence of April 11, 1878, also addressed to his
brother, Edward, as follows: «...Borneo: Treaty of 1847. I have a copy of it here; the Sultan
evades the treaty clause by giving us a sort of perpetual leasehold (instead of freehold)...».189

The Treaty of 1847 to which Mr. Dent referred to be the bilateral Treaty of Friendship and
Commerce, and for the Suppression of Slave Trade, concluded on May 27, 1847 between
«...Her Majesty the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland...and His
Highness Omar Ali Saifadeen, who sits upon the throne and rules the territories of
Borneo...the Sultan of Borneo...» (henceforth, the 1847 Treaty).

The letter sent by Mr. Robert George Wyndham Herbert —Colonial Office of the Kingdom
of Great Britain- to Sir Julian Pauncefote on April 24, 1878 contained the position of the
British Government on this issue, portrayed as follows:!9%°

«...2. It appears that this Society is composed partly of foreigners and partly of British subject,

The Right Honourable Earl Granville sent a note on November 21, 1881 to the
Netherlands Government clarifying that «...the territories ceded to Mr. Dent will be
administered by the Company [i.e., the British North Borneo Company] under the
suzerainty of the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, to whom they have agreed to pay a yearly
tribute. The British Government assumes no sovereign rights whatever in Borneo...».!92 His
Lordship later explained during debates held in the House of Lords on Monday, March 13,
1882 that

«...the Royal Charter gives no additional powers to the Company. It is of a restrictive character.
We obtain a negative control over the Company with regard to their general treatment of the
Natives and to their dealings with foreign Powers. We incur no obligation to give them military
assistance, except that which we give to all Englishmen engaged in trade in uncivilized
countries. ... the Charter would entail no responsibility upon Her Majesty's Government for the
protection of the country, beyond that which is inseparable from the nationality of those engaged
in developing its resources...The granting this Charter does not vest in Her Majesty any
Sovereignty over the territory, which remains under the suzerainty of the Sultan, although he
has delegated the administrative power to the Association...»

 

 

According to the above statements, the terms of the granting of the Royal Charter denied
the powers of British Government to the British North Borneo Company. Lord Granville
also clarified that the British Government was to be considered the only proper party who
should have entered into a protectorate agreement with the Sultan of Sulu, in whom —and
this is a crucial aspect- the sovereignty over North Borneo remained vested.

The 1903 Confirmatory Deed shows that the Sultan’s legal situation with respect to the
territory of North Borneo remained unaltered and therefore, the same reasoning and
conclusion apply.1%

him in 1845 of the Island of Labuan, situated on the north-west coast of Borneo, together with the adjacent islets of

In his letter of May 4, 1920, addressed to the Director of Non-Christian Tribes, Mr.
Carpenter admitted the sovereignty of the Sultan of Sulu over the Sultanate of Sulu —
including North Borneo- remained and was not affected by the Carpenter — Kiram
Agreement.!%

Based on the preceding analysis, it is the Arbitrator’s view that Mr. Dent, the British
Government and other authorities continuously acknowledged the sovereignty and the
dominion of the Sultan of Sulu over North Borneo. Therefore, the assessment of the
evidence available at the present arbitration sustains that the Sultan was never deprived
or divested of sovereignty over the territories of North Borneo, mentioned in both the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed.1%*

199. Once the issue of sovereignty and dominion of the Sultan of Sulu over North
Borneo is clarified, the Arbitrator should then turn to the immediate foundation of
Respondent’s defence in this arbitration.

It is that of cession, which, in its opinion, transferred on a permanent basis all rights of
sovereignty which the Sultan of Borneo may have possessed over certain territories of
North Borneo in favour of both Messrs. Dent and Overbeck through the signature of both
the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed.

The Arbitrator is not persuaded by Respondent’s arguments, unsupported by any
evidence.

200. The distribution of their own territory between two States is their sovereign
prerogative.

Cession was and still is a recognised mode of acquisition of territory in international law.

Cession can be characterised as a bilateral transaction which involves the consensual and
explicit transfer of sovereignty over a part of a given territory by one State or ruler (the
ceding State, which must be the legitimate sovereign) to another (the acquiring State). It
indisputably requires the co-operation and full consent of the two States concerned: the
ceding State and the acquiring State.

Cession is composed of two elements: (i) an agreement to cede, embodied in a treaty, and
(ii) the actual handing over of the territory ceded.

A treaty of cession —-which effects are opposable to all third States, to wit, erga omnes-!97
is the most unequivocal way in which a ceding State expresses its relinquishment of all
territorial claims to a territory in favour of another State, the receiving State, which
accepts it. The provisions of the treaty of cession should specify precisely the area to be
transferred and the conditions under which the transfer should be accomplished. Cession
may take place through a treaty of sale,!°* by exchange of one piece of real estate for
another,!°? by means of a gift? or, occasionally, by conveyance of title by devise.2°

Since cession entails a derivative title2°? which transfers full rights to the territory
concerned, the acquiring State may not possess more rights over the land than its
predecessor (Nemo plus juris ad alium transferre potest quam ipse habet).2°

201. In the Arbitrator’s opinion, the 1878 Agreement does not meet any of these
requirements under international law.

202. The 1878 Agreement cannot be characterised as an international treaty of
cession. The same reasoning and conclusion apply to the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, as both

the characterisation of the 1878 Agreement and the legal situation with respect to the
territory of North Borneo remained unaltered.2%

Under international law, a treaty conforms a binding formal agreement, contract, or other
written instrument that establishes obligations between two or more subjects of
international law, primarily independent States and international organizations.

The content of the 1878 Agreement shows that its terms were neither negotiated, nor
signed between two States but, conversely, by the «... Sultan of the State of Sulu...», on the
one part, and two private individuals, Messrs. Dent and Overbeck —jointly, on the other
part- both private individuals representing private commercial interests, specifically «...@
British Company...». Professor Dr. Brédermann confirms that, in his opinion, «...the 1878
Agreement does not bind two states...».20

The Spanish translation of the 1878 Agreement does not refer to the word tratado —the
Spanish translation of the word Treaty- but rather to the term escrito, which may be
translated into English language as document or writ.2°° The 1903 Confirmatory Deed
referred to the 1878 Agreement and characterised it as «...the Agreement...”, not as an
international treaty according to the definition provided above.

The content of Mr. Dent’s letter of April 11, 1878 evidences his technical ability to
distinguish between the concept of treaty —in the sense of an international instrument, the
1847 Treaty to which he referred therein- and of commercial agreement, «...a sort of
perpetual leasehold (instead of freehold)...» which corresponded to the private scheme he
convened with the Sultan of the State of Sulu in the 1878 Agreement.2°7

As analysed in the Preliminary Award, in his letter of July 24, 1878, Baron of Overbeck
referred to the 1878 Agreement as «...the agreement executed between His Highness, the
Sultan and myself as representative of British interests, in connection with the assignment
of certain portion of the eastern coast of Borneo...» and made a clear distinction «...with
any subsequent treaty executed by His Highness with other parts concerning those
territories which may still belong to him...». Therefore, it seems that the Baron of Overbeck
—as one of the signatories of the 1878 Agreement- clearly distinguished the term agreement
from the term treaty and, on that basis, characterised the 1878 Agreement as an
agreement of a commercial nature.2°°

Mr. Martinez answered this letter on July 24, 1878. Its wording also differentiated
between the term agreement —referring to the 1878 Agreement as «...a contract of lease

The 1903 Confirmatory Deed include some islands of North Borneo which would have been
later «...ceded to the Government of British Borneo...» and were to be treated as having
been included in the 1878 Agreement.

203. As previously explained, the cession of sovereignty over a given territory
requires the co-operation of the two States concerned: the ceding State and the acquiring
State. The ceding State —which must be the legitimate sovereign, in this case, the
Sultanate of Sulu- can only agree on a cession of sovereignty over a part of its territory to
the acquiring State. The terms of the 1878 Agreement do not contain any reference to any
acquiring State. The 1903 Confirmatory Deed, on its part, included an alleged cession of
certain islands of North Borneo «...to the Government of British Borneo...».

204. The capacity of the transferee in the 1878 Agreement and in the 1903
Confirmatory must be assessed carefully and individually.

205. Following Respondent’s allegations, Messrs. Dent and Overbeck, the joint
counterparty of the 1878 Agreement, were to be considered the transferee of the territory
of North Borneo.

The assessment of the evidence contemporary to the signature of the 1878 Agreement
submitted to the proceedings confirms —in the Arbitrator’s opinion- that Messrs. Dent and
Overbeck were acting in the 1878 Agreement as private individuals and not as
international persons (i.e., a State or an international institution).

Messrs. Dent and Overbeck had private speculative schemes in mind in relation to the
exploitation and management of the territory of North Borneo and did not even purport to
enter these transactions on behalf of the British Crown. In his letter of April 24, 1878, sent
from Downing Street and addressed to Sir Pauncefote, Mr. Herbert confirmed «...on behalf
of this [Colonial] Office an opinion on matters relating to Borneo and the contiguous island,

Mr. Treacher’s letter of January 2, 1878, addressed to the Earl of Derby, briefly explained
the scheme as follows: 2!

«...Baron de Overbeck...was acting in conjunction with Mr. Alfred Dent, a member of the well-
known British firm of Dent and Co., who, indeed, had the principal interest in the scheme; that
the object proposed was to buy out the American interest, and form a British Company
somewhat, though on a much smaller scale, after the manner of the late East India Company,
the main desire being to develop the agricultural resources of the northern portion of Borneo...

I more earnestly desired that that resources if this portion of Borneo should be developed by a
bona fide British Company...».

Its text contained no reference to the word Treaty.

Mr. Treacher further clarified in his letter of January 22, 1878, also addressed to the Earl
of Derby, that «...the Baron represented a bona fide British Company or co-partnership
with sufficient capital or the capacity of raising it, to carry out an undertaking of this
kind...».2!8, Mr. Dent confirmed this description in the correspondence sent to his brother,
Mr. Edward Dent, on February 18, 1878, where the former reflected on the fact that «...we
can ask anybody to put money into mortgages in a Crown Colony, but this Borneo scheme
is a matter for us to take up as merchants not as investors...»"4 and also in his application
for a Royal Charter from the British Government made on December 2, 1878.21

A cession of sovereign territory to private individuals (i.e., Messrs. Dent and Overbeck) or
to a private entity (ie., the British North Borneo Company) is not possible under
international law, because entities which do not rank as international persons are not
considered capable of acquiring sovereignty or competent to enter treaties or other
international relationships.

The British Government shared this conclusion. In his letter April 24, 1878, addressed to
Sir Julian Pauncefote, Mr. Herbert expressed «...0n behalf of this Office an opinion on
matters relating to Borneo and the contiguous island...3. If it is to be an English Company,
it appears to Sir Michael Hicks Beach that it is highly objectionable that sovereign rights
should be exercised by a private Company...».216

206. For the sake of discussion, it could have been further argued that Messrs. Dent
and Overbeck might have been commissioned as agents of the British Government, with
the mandate of acquiring sovereignty over North Borneo from the State of Sulu on behalf

of Britain through the signature of the 1878 Agreement and take successive possession of
this territory in favour of the United Kingdom (cession or acquisition by agents).

In this event, either of these two options would have been available:

A. That Messrs. Dent and Overbeck had received a previous authorization from
the British Government to take possession of North Borneo, so that the
assumption of sovereignty over North Borneo on the part of the authorizing
state —United Kingdom- would have been complete when Messrs. Dent and
Overbeck had properly carried out the annexation on the spot; or

B. That they had acted without any authorisation, subject to subsequent
ratification of their act by the British Government, so that the assumption of
sovereignty could then, within a reasonable time, be consummated by the
ratification of Messrs. Dent and Overbeck’s by the United Kingdom.

In either case, Messrs. Dent and Overbeck’s alleged acquisition of sovereignty over the
territory of North Borneo cannot by any means be imputed to the state for whose benefit
they were supposed to be acting (i.e., Great Britain), unless Respondent demonstrated in
this arbitration that Messrs. Dent and Overbeck were authorised agents of the United
Kingdom in advance, or their acts subsequently ratified by the British Government.

207. Respondent failed to demonstrate in this arbitration that Messrs. Dent and
Overbeck acted as authorised agents for the British Crown in the supposed acquisition of
North Borneo through the 1878 Agreement.

The Kratz Report confirms that the contents of the 1878 Agreement «...would not be
outside the well-established Malay model of governance and would keep the ruler in his
supreme position. Sovereignty was maintained...”.2!7 In his testimony during the Hearing,
Professor Kratz confirmed that the Sultan of Sulu was an absolute ruler in the territory
under his sovereignty, who must look after his people.2!8

On April 26, 1878, the Sultan of Sulu expressed his concern to Mr. Treacher on the fact
that the Datu Bandhara (i.e., Baron Overbeck) had hauled down the Sulu flag at
Sandakan and «...has made a Treaty with the Rajah of Brunei concerning our
territories...this also we cannot understand. We know this much; that a person is never
allowed to sell or dispose of other people’s property; the sale will not be considered

the House of Lords on Monday, March 13, 1882, 22! that sovereign rights to the North
Borneo territory remained vested in the Sultan in effect deny the issuance of any
authorization to Messrs. Dent and Overbeck to act as authorized agents of the British
Crown in the signature of the 1878 Agreement.

208. Respondent also failed to establish in these proceedings —through submission
of proper evidence in support of its statements- that the British Government subsequently
ratified Messrs. Dent and Overbeck’s alleged acts of acquisition of North Borneo. On the
contrary, the evidence available in the proceedings shows that it does not amount to an
expression of ratification of their acts of acquisition of North Borneo by the British
Government.?”?

209. Based on the preceding reasoning, the Arbitrator is of the view that
Respondent’s alleged permanent cession of sovereignty over North Borneo under the 1878
Agreement, while eventually made by a sovereign ruler such as the Sultanate of Sulu, did
not involve a State as a transferee of the territory of North Borneo. Messrs. Dent and
Overbeck acted as and remained private individuals. Therefore, the 1878 Agreement did
not embrace a permanent cession of sovereignty over North Borneo because it is not
possible under international law.

210. The 1903 Confirmatory Deed referred «...to the Government of British
Borneo...», as the supposed transferee of the territory of North Borneo.

The expression «...the Government of British Borneo...» deserves attention.

The first aspect to be highlighted is the reference to an undefined entity known as
«...British Borneo...» The Protectorate Agreement —signed on May 12, 1888- officially
referred to the territory of North Borneo as the State of North Borneo.228 This official
denomination remained until 1946. But the Protectorate Agreement does not mention any
form of State officially named or known as «...British Borneo...» —as referred in the 1903

 

Confirmatory Deed- and therefore «...British Borneo...» cannot be characterised either as
a subject of international law, or an acquiring State.

The second aspect to be emphasised is the use of the term «...Government...» in the 1903
Confirmatory Deed. Under the Protectorate Agreement, the British North Borneo

Company would continue to manage the territory without inferences and could call upon
the support of the Royal Navy and the British Army should any European power have
attempted to or seized control over the territory.2%4 This recognition is consistent with
certain relevant facts that occurred prior to the signature of the 1903 Confirmatory Deed.

On November 21, 1881, Earl Granville clarified to the Netherlands Government that
«...the territories ceded to Mr. Dent will be administered by the Company under the
suzerainty of the Sultans of Brunei and Sulu, to whom they have agreed to pay a yearly
tribute. The British Government assumes no sovereign rights whatever in Borneo...».225

In Article III of the 1885 Madrid Protocol,226 Spain relinquished all claims to Borneo and
adjacent islands and renounced, as far as regarded the British government, all claims of
sovereignty over the territories of the continent of Borneo which had belonged in the past
to the Sultan of Sulu and «...which form part of the territories administered by the
Company styled the British North Borneo Company...» delimited on the 1878 Agreement
and in the Royal Charter.227

Thus, the Arbitrator is of the view that Respondent’s alleged permanent cession of
sovereignty over North Borneo under the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, while eventually made
by a sovereign ruler such as the Sultanate of Sulu, did not involve a State as a transferee
of the territory of North Borneo.

The British Borneo referred therein did not exist as an international person, nor did it
have any Government. Since May 12, 1888, the State of North Borneo —on which the
British Government assumed no sovereign rights whatsoever- was admittedly
«...administered by the Company styled the British North Borneo Company...”.

The British North Borneo Company was a chartered company. A chartered company is an
association with investors or shareholders that is incorporated and granted rights (often
exclusive rights) by royal charter (or similar instrument of government) for the purpose of
trade, exploration, and/or colonization. The granting of the Royal Charter permitted the
British North Borneo Company, as a private Company, to administer the State of North
Borneo under the conditions provided by the Royal Charter. Hence, the British North
Borneo Company had two main responsibilities in return for annual payments made by
its shareholders: the economic development through the exploitation of natural resources
of the area, purported to producing dividends; and the protection of local religions, customs
and rights of its residents, including the commitment to abolish slavery and to cede its
foreign relations to Britain to administer. Following the opinion of Sir Michael Hicks

Beach, previously quoted, «...it is highly objectionable that sovereign rights should be
exercised by a private Company...».228

Therefore, the 1903 Confirmatory Deed cannot be characterised as an international treaty.
It did not embrace a bilateral transaction between two States to cede with a permanent
character the sovereignty over territory of North Borneo by the then Sultan of the State
of Sulu in favour of the British North Borneo Company, as transferee. The British North
Borneo Company, a private entity, cannot be considered a subject of international law, or
an acquiring State.

211. The wording of the 1878 Agreement, as well as the 1903 Confirmatory Deed,
also lacks the second element for a cession of sovereignty to be categorised as validly made
under international law: the actual handing over of the territory which sovereignty is
ceded —to wit, North Borneo- in favour of an acquiring State. The assessment of the
evidence available in these proceedings reinforces the Arbitrator’s view.

The Royal Charter indicated the exact scope of the powers of the British North Borneo
Company. As a private entity incorporated under the laws of Great Britain, the British
North Borneo Company cannot be considered as an acquiring State and therefore it could
not have possessed sovereign powers on its own under international law. Mr. Treacher (in
his correspondence of January 2, 1878 and of January 22, 1878), Mr. Dent (in his letter
dated February 18, 1878) and the Respondent in Exhibit C 52 confirmed the private nature
of this scheme.

Mr. Dent admitted in his correspondence to his brother of February 18, 1878 that the
Sultan of Sulu acted as if he wanted to retain some rights over North Borneo. The Sultan’s
apparent reluctance was real, derived from the limitations imposed by Clause 10 of the
1847 Treaty, the contents of which were admittedly known to Mr. Dent. In his
correspondence of January 2, 1878, Mr. Treacher confirmed to the Earl of Derby that the
Sultan of Sulu «...stated that he had desired to act in accordance with the Treaty...he had
endeavoured, so far as he was capable, to fulfil his Treaty engagement in this matter...».229
The letter sent by Mr. Herbert to Sir Julian Pauncefote on April 24, 1878 contained the
serious objections of the British Government to the viability of this private scheme,
because of the possible infringement of Clause 10 of the 1847 Treaty.

Lord Granville disclaimed on November 21, 1881 any intention on the part of the British
Crown to assume either dominion or sovereignty over North Borneo and categorically
stated that sovereign over that territory remined vested in the Sultan of Sulu.

Article III of the 1885 Madrid Protocol clarified that North Borneo belonged to the Sultan
of Sulu and was to be considered as territories administered by the British North Borneo
Company.

The Protectorate Agreement recognized that the British North Borneo Company
administered the territory of North Borneo. But it did not state nor suggest that
sovereignty over North Borneo appertained to the British North Borneo Company as a
consequence of the 1878 Agreement.

The 1903 Confirmatory Deed upheld the continuing and uninterrupted sovereignty of the
Sultan of Sulu over North Borneo and its adjacent islands and confirmed the extent of his
dominion over which the British North Borneo Company had authority to administer and
manage under the terms and conditions of the Royal Charter.

The 1903 Confirmatory Deed ratified that the legal situation over North Borneo since the
signature of the 1878 Agreement remained unaltered. As a commercial Charted Company,
the British North Borneo Company continued as administrator of this territory and not as
sovereign, because it was not an international person capable of acquiring sovereignty or
competent to enter treaties or other international relationships.

212. The result of the evidence gathered and assessed in this arbitration allows the
Arbitrator to conclude that the conduct and legal commitments of both Great Britain and
the British North Borneo Company have upheld the independence and sovereignty of the
Sultan of Sulu over North Borneo, within the framework of the British legal system as
well as before the international community.

Neither Messrs. Dent and Overbeck, nor the British North Borneo Company were
authorised to assume sovereign title over the territory of North Borneo for and on behalf
of the British Crown.

The 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed cannot be characterised as valid
instruments under international law of permanent cession of territorial sovereignty over

the mainland of North Borneo and its adjacent islands.

Therefore, the signature of the 1878 Agreement and of the 1903 Confirmatory Deed do not
affect Malaysia’s sovereignty.

individuals, representing private commercial interests. The Claimants maintain that the
Spanish translation of the 1878 Agreement «...unambiguously describes it as a lease...»
agreement constituted by Messrs. Dent and Overbeck with the Sultan of Sulu for the
exploitation of the natural resources of certain territory along the North Coast of Borneo
on which the Sultan of Sulu remained sovereign, for an undetermined period and in return
of a series of annual rental payments. Therefore, Claimants allege that the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed articulate a «...commercial concession for the
territory at issue...»?*! and thus a matter of commercial law, rather than that of
international law. In support of this conclusion, Claimants submitted with their
Statement of Claim both the Kratz Report and the Brédermann Report II.

214. As already explained in the Final Award, Respondent rejected Claimants’
characterisation of the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed and chose not to
provide any expert report.

215. The analysis deployed in Section VII.1.ii-A of this Final Award confirmed that
the disputed relationship, transacted —at least on one side- by private individuals and
companies and, therefore, did not involve the transfer of sovereign or even ownership
rights over the territory of North Borneo in accordance with international law.

216. The construction of a contract must determine the common intention of the
parties, taking into account, in particular, the nature and purpose of the contract, the
conduct of the parties though its negotiation and enforcement and the meaning commonly
given to contract and trade expressions in the trade concerned. Its stipulations shall be
interpreted consideration the entire contract in which they appear.

From this standpoint, it is the Arbitrator’s view that the assessment of the legal
characterisation of the 1878 Agreement needs to commence on April 11, 1878, immediately
after its signature. On this date Mr. Dent, one of the signatories and therefore a relevant
source of interpretation, admitted that, through the 1878 Agreement, the Sultan of Sulu
gave him and Baron of Overbeck «...a sort of perpetual leasehold (instead of freehold)...»
over the territory of North Borneo and its adjacent islands. 22

The result of the evidence gathered ratifies the exactitude of Mr. Dent’s assertion.

217. Mr. Dent’s statement differentiates three commercial legal concepts
pertaining to common law that the Arbitrator needs to consider: the concept of lease and
the concept of leasehold, as opposed to the concept of freehold.

Freehold is legally defined as permanent and absolute tenure of land with freedom to
dispose of it at will. The proprietor of the freehold —the freeholder- owns the property and
the land it stands on.

If a freeholder grants a lease, it becomes a landlord, through the signature of a lease
agreement with the tenant, defined as a person who has the right to use something such
as land, a building, or a piece of equipment, according to a lease contract and pays a rent
to its owner. In the lease agreement, the two parties -the landlord and the tenant- will
specify the terms and conditions under which the landlord will convey to the tenant
exclusive possession, control, use or enjoyment of land or a building, in return for a
quantified rent and for a specified period after which expiration the property reverts to
the owner.

Hence, the lease agreement does not result in the transfer of rights of dominion or
ownership over the land. The lease creates, instead, the leasehold, defined as the right to
use and have exclusive possession (but not ownership) of land where it stands by the
tenant for a set period —which can be a number of years, decades or centuries- and subject
to the fulfilment of certain conditions as recorded in the lease agreement entered into with
the landlord.

218. The 1878 Agreement provides that the Sultan leased?" the territory of North
Borneo —«...haber convenido en terminar el contrato de arrendamiento de Sandakan...»- to
Messrs. Dent and Overbeck. Claimants identify this point as the core of the present
dispute:234

«...182. This misconception stems for a British (mis)translation of the original language of the
1878 Lease Agreement, namely the Jawi (formal Malay in Arabic script). Whether deliberately
or otherwise, the British rendered the operative Malay description of the contractual
arrangement as «...to grant and cede...»

183. This translation is quite simply wrong. A plethora of both contemporary and modern
sources show beyond doubt that the key term in the 1878 Lease Agreement —«...pajakan..-
means «...to lease...»...».

219. Page 2 of Exhibit C 14 contains the Malay text of the 1878 Agreement, where
the term pajakan appears. Claimants sustain their position on this linguistic issue in the
Kratz Report, not rebutted by Respondent. The exact interpretation of this term is of

utmost importance in this matter, because when there is doubt as to the meaning of a
contract term, an interpretation should be preferred that makes the contract lawful and
effective (ut res magis valet quam pereat).

In § 1 of the Kratz Report, Professor Kratz discloses that he had «...been asked by Paul H.
Cohen, Esq., of 4-5 Gray’s In Square, London WC1R 5AH, to provide a lexicographical
analysis of the Malay word pajakan, as well as a more extensive report on the pajakan
system in the context of the traditional Malay polity, with particular reference to two hand-
written Malay documents originating from the court of the Sultans of Sulu, a contract of
1878 and a regal declaration from 1903. I understand that these documents have been
submitted in an arbitration proceeding as Exhibits C-12 and C-17, respectively...».

Professor Kratz declared to be independent and impartial of the Parties and their Counsel
and held to the statement of truth during the Hearing.”*> The Arbitrator is satisfied with
his impartiality and independence, as well as with his technical competencies to deal with
this sophisticated analysis. Professor Kratz was made witness available to cross examine
regarding the Kratz Report.

The Arbitrator found in the § 38 of the Kratz Report a proper semantical explanation of
the term pajakan, which is significant for the determination of the debated issue:

«...88. Turning to the three Sulu documents from 1878 (A. Treaty and B. Letter of Authority)
and 1903 (Declaration and Reaffirmation of 1878 Treaty) pajak appears in several forms which
are not unusual and conform to the conventions of forming nouns and words in Malay by
affixation. Pajakan which occurs several times is simply the noun which is created by adding
the suffix -an to the root word pajak; it means lease, leasehold. Dipajakkan is a fully formed

 

narrative (passive) verb which translates best as «...being given in lease...». Pajakkan in its
turn is grammatically the same dipajakkan as before, different only by the dropping of the prefix
di- which syntactically has been replaced by the royal We (kita) which is best translated as
«...We have given in lease...» (lit. (the territory) has been given in lease by Us). However, it is
probably fair to say that in the third line from the bottom of the 1903 declaration there should
be a noun which the scribe spelt erroneously pajakkan by adding -kan instead of an to the root
word. This is probably the result of a hearing error as a scribe would listen to the dictation of
this statement rather than fully thinking about the meaning of what he took down. The 1903
document looks after all rather like a hastily drawn up declaration. Generally it would have
been poor penmanship to correct any scribal mistake in a document of this kind and by doing
so draw attention to the mistake. Hence it stands...»

«..Pajakan...means lease, leasehold...».26 Exhibit 6 of the Kratz Report contains an
extract of «...classic Jawi-Malay-English Dictionary...» of 1903, where the word «...Pajak

26 Kratz Report, 38. During his testimony, Professor Kratz clarified that «... pajakan is a contract which allows one party,

a person and company to own or occupy land and cultivate land, use a building, make use, exploit a building for a certain

time against a payment and other conditions which are agreed by the owner...» (Professor Kratz Transcription, p. 65).

North Borneo and its adjacent islands gave to him and Baron of Overbeck by the Sultan
of Sulu.?88

220. In his letter of January 2, 1878, Mr. Treacher —a direct witness of the
transaction- conceptually explained the scheme as follows: 2°?

 

«...Mr. Torrey, an American subject, now United States’ paid Vice-Consul at Bangkok, Siam,
and formerly a trader at Hong Kong, who was the President of the American Trading Company
...and in whim, as President were vested all the rights, &c., conceded to said Company by the
various grants of the Sultan and Rajahs of Brunei, with the power of disposing of them to other
parties...Mr. Torrey consequently claims the right of disposing as he likes of the concessions he
holds...

 

 

When I casually suggested to the Baron that it was possible that the concession held by Mr.
Torrey had lapsed from time, they having been made for ten years only, because no payments
had been made by the grantee, he pointed out that the concessions were renewable at the end of
ten years, and that no fixed time is appointed for the payment of the rental, and that
consequently Mr. Torrey had grounds to go upon claiming that the concessions he possessed
were still in force, and that in order to take away any such grounds form under his feet, and to
do away with the chance of any complication with the United States’ Government he had
decided to buy him out, as I have already said.

I then suggested that the better plan would be not to transfer Mr. Torrey’s grant, but to have it
cancelled and obtain a fresh one from the Sultan, which should be formally drawn up, and be,

so far as regards the Sultan, as fairer and less one-sided concession.

Such, the Baron said was his desire.

 

His Highness had a boat prepared to send over to Labuan the drafts of the concessions, but Mr.
Overbeck by threatening to leave the river if the deeds were not at once signed, and by actually
sending his snip down to the bar while he himself remained in the town io his steam-launch,
prevailed upon the Sultan to affix his seal...

The concessions obtained by Messrs. Overbeck and Dent include the whole northern portion of
Borneo from the River Sulaman on the west to the River Sibuco on the east, and, to the south of
Sulaman, the harbours and coasts of Gaya and Sapangar, the districts of Pappar, Benoni, and

27 During his testimony, Professor Kratz stated that «... One should stress these are contemporary dictionaries for the time
when treaties were -- contracts were negotiated, and Klinkert later, the Dutch ones that follow that and Wilkinson are not
just old dictionaries of old Malay texts. They were contemporary at the time, and they hit precisely the time of colonial
expansion, as well, further contact with Europeans and greater interest in trying to find out what Malay is and using it.
That is what it means...» (Professor Kratz Transcription, p. 69).

In his description, Mr. Treacher detailed the existence of previous concessions granted by
the Sultan of Sulu to an American citizen for a period of ten years in exchange of the
payment of a rental. These concessions were of commercial nature, as they were granted
to American private citizens.

It also mentioned the recommendation Mr. Treacher made to Mr. Overbeck, concerning
the obtention from the Sultan of Sulu of a brand-new commercial concession, «...to develop
the agricultural resources of the northern portion of Borneo...». «...Such, the Baron said,
was his desire...». The reiterated use of the term concession should be highlighted.2“°

The use of the word «...lessees...» by Mr. Treacher applied to refer to Messrs. Dent and

It is the Arbitrator’s view that the terms and conditions contained therein corresponded
to the ones articulated in the 1878 Agreement: the proper identification of the parties (the
Sultan of Sulu, on the one part, and Messrs. Dent and Overbeck, on the other), the
delimitation of certain territory along the North Coast of Borneo for the exclusive
possession, control, use and management by Messrs. Dent and Overbeck, a quantified
annual rent «...to the Sultan of the sum of 5,000 dollars...» and its duration, constituted
for an undetermined period and therefore constituting a long-term contract.243 These are
the constituent elements of a lease agreement, which created «...a sort of perpetual
leasehold (instead of freehold)...» over the territory of North Borneo and its adjacent
islands, in accordance with Mr. Dent’s assertion of April 11, 1878.244

The Sultan of Sulu reaffirm his twofold condition of freeholder and landlord of North
Borneo. According to the of the 1878 Agreement, the purpose of its signature was to allow
Messrs. Dent and Overbeck the management of North Borneo and its adjacent islands,
«.,..the lands that are of my domain...» («...las tierras que son de mi dominio...»). Messrs.
Dent and Overbeck hence became tenants. In the Arbitrator’s opinion, the Sultan’s
statement also confirmed that the 1878 Agreement, as a lease agreement, did not result
in the transfer of rights of dominion or ownership or permanent cession of his territorial
sovereignty over the mainland of North Borneo and its adjacent islands in favour of
Messrs. Dent and Overbeck.?#°

 

221. As mentioned in the Preliminary Award, on July 22, 1878, Mr. Carlos

Baron of Overbeck answered his letter on July 24, 1878 and referred to the 1878
Agreement as «...the agreement executed between His Highness, the Sultan and myself as
representative of British interests, in connection with the assignment of certain portion of

agreement of a commercial nature.247 Mr. Martinez answered this letter on July 24, 1878.
Its wording once again, referred to the 1878 Agreement as «...a contract of lease with the
very Sultan...» and made the reservation that it would be Baron of Overbeck himself who
«,..will understand the value of your contract...».248

222. Based on this analysis, the Arbitrator concludes that the 1878 Agreement can
be characterized as an international private lease agreement, of commercial nature,
entered between a local ruler -the Sultan of Sulu- and international private investors,
Messrs. Dent and Overbeck.

2. The Objection on the Admissibility of the Claim

i. The Parties’ Positions

223. Respondent raised objection on the admissibility of the Claimants’ claim on
the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed. Respondent failed to provide
allegations on this issue in the arbitration and, instead, chose to develop them scattered
in an anti-suit injunction request filed before the Courts of Malaysia on December 3,
2019,49 in 9 6, 7, 14 to 23 and 77 to 89 of Exhibit C 114 and in § 14 of the Suspension
Order Request, all of them incorporated into the proceedings.

Based on their contents, Respondent’s position on the challenge can be summarised as
follows. Respondent contends the commercial nature of the 1878 Agreement and
characterises it instead as an international treaty that would have articulated the cession
by the Sultan of Sulu of his territorial sovereignty over North Borneo in favour of Messrs.
Dent and Overbeck. The 1903 Confirmatory Deed ratified, in its opinion, the nature of the
1878 Agreement.

Respondent submits that the present arbitration breached its sovereign immunity, as,
through this arbitration, Claimants would seek the reversion in their favour of these
territories «...internationally recognized as belonging to Malaysia, a sovereign State...».2>°
On this premise, Respondent affirms that the subject matter in dispute is not freely
negotiated between the signatories of the 1878 Agreement and therefore, it is not capable
of being settled by arbitration.

Respondent concludes that the present dispute conflicts with public policy and thus
breaches Article 2.1 of the SAA. Respondent chose not to provide any expert report along
with its allegations in support of this position and provided no reasons for the absence of
this submission.

224. Claimants reject Respondent’s position and sustain the arbitrability of the
present dispute, based on the arguments contained in {| 78 — 87 of the Counter — Memorial
on Jurisdiction and in {78 and 162 to 231 of Exhibit C 115. Claimants also consider as
relevant the contents of {J 90 to 97, 115 and 116 of the Preliminary Award.

Claimants are direct descendants and legal heirs of Jamal-ul Kiram II, the last Sultan of
Sulu and North Borneo and successor-in-title of the signatory of the 1878 Agreement.?*!
Malaysia, on its part, admitted that it became the successor-in-title of the British North
Borneo Company under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed upon
the establishment of its Federation on September 16, 1963.22

Claimants affirm that the purpose of the present dispute concerns the resolution of a
commercial difference arising from the execution of the 1878 Agreement, a simple private
commercial agreement unrelated to any claim of sovereignty over the territory of North
Borneo and its adjacent islands. Claimants allege that, through this arbitration, they
simply seek to vindicate before Respondent their legitimate commercial rights under the
terms of the 1878 Agreement.

Claimants conclude that, contrary to Respondent’s opinion, the matter in dispute was
freely negotiated by the Parties and is arbitrable.2*

ii. The Arbitrator’s Analysis and Findings

225. The Arbitrator will analyse the challenge of the substantive admissibility of
Claimants’ claim raised by Respondent in this international commercial arbitration,
pursuant to the provisions of the SAA, which remain silent on any conceptual distinction
between jurisdiction and admissibility in arbitration. The Parties’ submissions provide no
clear — cut distinction between these terms.

226. Jurisdiction is the power of the Arbitrator to hear and decide the case at hand.
Respondent challenged the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction, through the medium of a plea that,
in its opinion, the Arbitrator himself would be incompetent to give any ruling at all
whether as to the merits or as to the admissibility of the claim on both the 1878 Agreement
and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed. §/{/ 88 — 121 of the Preliminary Award analysed the
issue, dismissed Respondent’s objection and declared the validity of both the Arbitration
Agreement and the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction over the claims made by Claimants against
Respondent, in relation with the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed. The
Parties are kindly referred to the contents of the Preliminary Award.

227. An objection on the substantive admissibility of the claim refers to the
acceptability of the case.

In the case at hand, Respondent articulated the substantive objection as a plea to
determine whether the present case itself is defective —so that the Arbitrator should rule
the claim inadmissible on some ground other than its ultimate merit- or whether it is
appropriate for the Arbitrator to hear it.

For that purpose, Respondent challenged the Arbitrator’s exercise of his adjudicative
power in relation to the claims on the 1878 Agreement submitted to him by Claimants.

Respondent alleges that, through this arbitration, Claimants would seek the reversion in
their favour of territories of North Borneo, «...internationally recognized as belonging to
Malaysia, a sovereign State...»?>4 and therefore and because of its nature, in its opinion,
the subject matter of the arbitration would not be capable of being settled in this
arbitration.

The result of the evidence gathered in this arbitration disproved Respondent’s contention.

228. The doctrine of sovereign immunity is composed of two facets: its procedural
defence and its substantive defence.

229. As an objection of procedural nature, State immunity serves, amongst other
functions, as a method of distinguishing between matters relating to public administration
of a State and private law claims. When it comes to arbitration, if there is no title of
jurisdiction, then the Arbitrator cannot act.

4] 88 — 121 of the Preliminary Award analysed this issue and declared the Arbitrator’s
jurisdiction to decide over the Claimants’ claim related to both the 1878 Agreement and
the 1903 Confirmatory Deed. The Preliminary Award has not been set aside by any Court
and has been recognised in France, as the Exequatur of the Preliminary Award
demonstrates.

Therefore, beyond the jurisdictional objection decided in the Preliminary Award,
Respondent’s formulation of a substantive objection related with the 1878 Agreement
necessarily assumes the prior existence of the Arbitrator’s jurisdiction in deciding the
merits of the present claim, as the Preliminary Award declared.

230. The determination of sovereign immunity also depends on the substantive
characterisation of the act in question as sovereign or non-sovereign, and, specifically, on
whether the debated difference arises from or conforms a commercial transaction of the
State.

A simple commercial act performed by a State in the normal course of trading activities
implies that it descended into the sphere of commercial contracts and transactions so as
to acquire rights and to assume obligations like any other private person. Therefore, in
cases involving obligations arising out of contracts or transactions of this nature
concluded, a State should not attempt to enjoy immunity as these acts have nothing to do
with the exercise of sovereign acts.

This is the essence of the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity, which contributed to a
redefinition of sovereign activities and therefore of sovereignty. This restrictive approach
focuses primarily on the sovereign or commercial nature of the transaction at issue, rather
than on the structural relationship between a private party and the State entity
concerned. Even a State is not immune if the disputed transaction is commercial, as it will
recognise immunity for those acts the State carried out in the exercise of its sovereign
authority but will deny immunity for those acts of a commercial or private law nature

undertaken by the State.2°> Malaysia subscribes to the common law doctrine of restrictive
immunity.2°6 This will also be the approach followed in the Final Award.

231. The notion of commercial activity -the commerciality test- imports the
existence of an activity related to business and trade, arising from a transaction engaged
voluntarily between two parties and made —expressly or impliedly- by reference to the
private law of a national jurisdiction or alternative dispute resolution mechanism. These
requirements are met in the present case.

The Preliminary Award declared the validity of the Arbitration Agreement.

The Final Award has already determined the commercial nature of the 1878 Agreement.
It is an international private lease agreement,?*’ voluntarily entered into between a local
ruler —the Sultan of Sulu- and international private investors, Messrs. Dent and Overbeck,
for the exploitation of the natural resources —«...aprovechar sus minerales, productos
forestales y animales...» («...profit from its minerals, forest products and animals...)- of
certain territory along the North Coast of Borneo —on which the Sultan of Sulu remained
sovereign- for an undetermined period and in return of a series of annual rental
payments.2°8

232. Mr. Treacher’s letter of January 2, 1878 confirmed Messrs. Dent and
Overbeck’s «...main desire being to develop the agricultural resources of the northern
portion of Borneo...».259 These activities included the exploitation and management of
mber...tropical produce...valuable mineral resources and the trade in bird-nests,

233. Claimants are direct descendants and legal heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu

determined in the Mackaskie Judgment.2

In its letter of September 19, 2019,26° Malaysia admitted in this arbitration that it became
the successor-in-title of the British North Borneo Company under both the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed upon the establishment of its Federation on
September 16, 1963, as follows:

«...6. Over time, obviously the contracting parties changed. Upon the establishment of Malaysia
on 16" September 1968, Malaysia became the successor-in-title to the British Company viz. the
British North Borneo Company under the 1878 Grant and Confirmation by Sultan of Sulu of
Cession of Certain Islands dated 22nd April 1903 (1903 Confirmation of Cession)...».

 

On that contractual condition, Respondent freely proclaimed in its letter of September 19,
2019 that «...from 1963 to 2012, that is, for an unbroken and continuous period of 49 years,
Malaysia had been, under the 1878 Grant, paying ... (... the successors-in-title to the Sultan

the settling of the present dispute and so invited Claimants to «...discontinue all

Final Award

It is the Arbitrator’s view that Respondent’s position contained in this letter is inconsistent
with its challenge of the arbitrability of the dispute.

The transcribed terms reveal the absence of any reservation made at that time (ie.,
September 19, 2019), once the present arbitration was set in motion, that these
proceedings would breach its sovereign immunity or that Claimants would seek, through
their institution, the reversion in their favour of these territories «...internationally
recognized as belonging to Malaysia, a sovereign State...» as Respondent seems now to
maintain.

On the contrary, the wording of this letter may indicate the commercial nature of the
transaction articulated under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed.

In accordance with Articles 2.1.1 and 2.1.6 (3) of the UNIDROIT Principles, this letter
demonstrates that Malaysia, Respondent, accepted the validity of the 1878 Agreement and
of the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, their commercial nature and their binding effects between
the Parties: Respondent «...agrees to fully comply with the 1878 Grant and the 1903
Confirmation of Cession from henceforth with regards to future payments...».

Article 2.1.1 of the UNIDROIT Principles establishes that «...[a] contract may be concluded
either by the acceptance of an offer or by conduct of the parties that is sufficient to show
agreement...». This provision should be read in conjunction with Article 2.1.6 (3) of the
UNIDROIT Principles, which provides guidance on this «...conduct of the parties that is
sufficient to show agreement...» as follows: «... if, by virtue of the offer or as a result of

 

practices which the parties have established between themselves or of usage, the offeree may
indicate assent by performing an act without notice to the offeror, the acceptance is effective
when the act is performed...».

Its official comment establishes «...the form such conduct should assume: most often it will
consist in acts of performance, such as the payment of an advance on the price...»
Respondent admitted the existence of annual payments to Claimants under the terms of
the 1878 Agreement and of the 1903 Confirmatory Deed «...from 1968 to 2012, that is, for
an unbroken and continuous period of 49 years...». Respondent therefore admitted that it
voluntary incurred in a «...conduct...that is sufficient to show agreement...» with the legal
nature and binding terms and conditions of the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed towards Claimants.

234. Treating the whole issue as one of individualization and having regard to the
factual and legal issues, the assessment of the nature of the 1878 Agreement as a State
transaction, and not of the purpose of the State activity, is crucial to determine the
existence of State immunity —as Respondent maintains, and Claimants deny- and
therefore of the substantive arbitrability of the present dispute. The surrounding
circumstances of the case will be characterised as narrowly as reasonably possible as
either a commercial transaction or a sovereign act.

Ad Hoe Arbitration
Fornan et al v Malaysia

Final Award

235. The general principle is that a State is presumptively immune under
International Law.

236. For Respondent’s objection to succeed, the preponderance of the evidence
required Respondent to prove in this arbitration the characterisation of its acts in relation
to the enforcement of the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed as sovereign.
However, the fact that the commercial act serves some sovereign or public purpose will
not be sufficient to attract sovereign immunity, since every act of the State, by definition,
serves a public purpose. For the governmental character to concur, Respondent had the
burden of demonstrating to the Arbitrator that what is done must be something which
explicitly possesses that nature; specifically, that it has exercised powers peculiar to
sovereign (acta de iure imperii), as it alleges, that belong to its sovereign authority and
therefore to public law. Otherwise, it would be concluded that a State —including
Respondent- engages in commercial activity for the purpose of the restrictive theory only
where it acts in the manner of a private player within the market.

237. Therefore, a commercial or private law exception to immunity is the hallmark
of the restrictive approach, recognised, in principle, by all countries which adhere to the
restrictive doctrine of State immunity. When a State is engaged in a commercial
transaction, it acts as a trader, not as an independent sovereign State; because it has
ceased to act in a public capacity, it has no immunity for the commercial transactions.
Consequently, immunity shall be denied in the case at hand in relation to the claims on
the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed only if a commercial exception is
established through the result of the evidence gathered in this arbitration.

Claimants have the burden of proving in these proceedings that Respondent engaged in
the 1878 Agreement as a commercial activity carried out for profit (the payment of an
annual rent of 5,300 dollars to Claimants for the exploitation by Respondent —as the
successor-in-title of the British North Borneo Company- of the natural resources of North
Borneo).

In that case, the commercial nature of the acts performed by Respondent under the 1878
Agreement can be readily assumed, as it is understood that Respondent has then acted as
a private person and that activity related to the enforcement of both the 1878 Agreement
and 1903 Confirmatory Deed belongs to the sphere of private law, because Respondent, as
a sovereign State, then only exercises those powers that can also be exercised by private
citizens (acta de iure gestionis).

238. It can be established that the commercial exception to sovereign immunity will
be demonstrated when two conditions are fulfilled:

A. That Claimants discharged in this arbitration their burden of proving the
existence of this exception in relation to the enforcement of the 1878 Agreement
and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed; and

B. That Respondent, being a foreign State, has not appeared in this arbitration,
where the immunity is debated, and therefore provided no defence whatsoever.

Both conditions were fulfilled in the present case. As analysed in Section VII.1.ii.B of this
Final Award, the result of the evidence in this arbitration demonstrated the commercial
nature of the transaction articulated under the 1878 Agreement and, therefore, the
concurrence of the aforementioned commercial exception. Respondent’s non-involvement
in this arbitration and the absence of any defence whatsoever on this issue has also been
determined in Section IV.5 of this Final Award, the contents of which are reiterated hereby
for the sake of brevity.

239. Once demonstrated that on September 16, 1963, Respondent —as a sovereign
State- entered the market as the successor-in-title of the British North Borneo Company
for the enforcement of the 1878 Agreement, an international private lease agreement, a
characterisation of that act as commercial continues. The admitted undertaking of this
commercial activity by Respondent may be treated as irrevocable in its nature and its
subsequent conversion into an exercise of sovereign immunity, as Respondent purported
with the objection on the substantive admissibility of the claim in this arbitration, should
not be permitted. Therefore, Respondent’s objection of the admissibility of Claimants’
claims under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed cannot be upheld.

3. The Breach of the 1878 Agreement and of the 1903 Confirmatory Deed

i. The Parties’ Positions

240. Claimants submit that they have been complying with both the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, but Malaysia, on its part, would have
incurred in a fundamental breach of its essential payment obligations under their terms
since January 1, 2013, for reasons attributable, in their opinion, to the Respondent,?* as

remedy, 2°? the termination of the 1878 Agreement pursuant to Article 7.3.1 of the
UNIDROIT Principles as of January 1, 2013 or, in the alternative, as of February 2020.2”

Claimants plead, as an alternative claim,27! that the 1878 Agreement had become
unbalanced to their detriment, as the surrounding circumstances at the time of its
signature would have radically changed by the subsequent discovery of natural resources
(i.e., hydrocarbons and palm oil) during the decade of 1970.

Claimants allege that the Parties would have been unable to anticipate nor to include this
expansion in either the 1878 Agreement or the 1903 Confirmatory Deed and failed to make
any further amendment of either of the documents after said discoveries. Claimants seek
the delimitation by the Arbitrator of the scope and terms of a properly rebalanced
agreement, under the hardship doctrine contained in Article 6.2.2 of the UNIDROIT
Principles as alternative relief, if the Arbitrator does not terminate the 1878 Agreement
and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed.272

Claimants submitted the Brédermann Report II with their Statement of Claim, in support
of their position. Professor Dr. Brédermann was made witness available to cross examine
regarding the Brédermann Report II.

241. Respondent’s letter of September 19, 2019 contains its position on this issue
as follows:?7

«...6. Over time, obviously the contracting parties changed. Upon the establishment of Malaysia
on 16% September 1968, Malaysia became the successor-in-title to the British Company viz. the
British North Borneo Company under the 1878 Grant and Confirmation by Sultan of Sulu of
Cession of Certain Islands dated 22nd April 1903 (1903 Confirmation of Cession). From 1963
to 2012, that is, for an unbroken and continuous period of 49 years, Malaysia had been, under
the 1878 Grant, paying your clients (themselves the successors-in-title to the Sultan of Sulu) the
annual sum 5300 dollars. The payment was increased by 300 dollars per annum by way of the
1903 Confirmation of Cession.

Respondent chose not to provide any expert report nor reasons for the absence of this
submission.

ii. The Arbitrator’s Analysis and Findings

242. Claimants plead a principal claim and seek, as main remedy, the termination
of both the 1878 Agreement and of the 1903 Confirmatory Deed. Claimant plead an
alternative claim and seek, as alternative remedy in the event that the principal claim is
rejected, the delimitation by the Arbitrator of the scope and terms of a properly rebalanced
agreement. Therefore, the admissibility of the alternative claim will be examined only if
the principal claim is rejected.

243. The parties to a contract must always act according to what is reasonable in
view of the particular nature of their relationship and the circumstances involved,
including their economic interests and expectations.

244. The Final Award characterised the 1878 Agreement as an international
private lease agreement, of commercial nature, entered into between a local ruler —the
Sultan of Sulu, in his twofold condition of freeholder and landlord of North Borneo- and
international private investors, Messrs. Dent and Overbeck, who hence became tenants.
The 1878 Agreement is a valid contract and its terms, binding upon the Parties.

Final Award

On November 1, 1881, the British Gladstone Government granted the Royal Charter and
the British North Borneo Company was incorporated. The British North Borneo
Provisional Association Limited was dissolved and restructured itself as the British North
Borneo Company, which started its activity on May 12, 1882. The British North Borneo
Company assumed and honoured the payment obligations undertaken by Dent and
Overbeck and the North Borneo Provisional Association Limited in the 1878 Agreement.
The British North Borneo Company was authorised and empowered to assume the
management of the territory delimited on the 1878 Agreement, under the conditions
provided by the Royal Charter. The British North Borneo Company was tenant since then
until the signature of the 1946 North Borneo Cession Agreement.27>

The Final Award has also determined:

A. That Claimants are direct descendants and legal heirs of the last Sultan of Sulu
and North Borneo and successor-in-title of the signatory of the 1878 Agreement;
and

B. That Malaysia became the successor-in-title of the British North Borneo
Company under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed
upon the establishment of its Federation on September 16, 1963, and assumed
the role of the contractual counterparty under the 1878 Agreement and the
1903 Confirmatory Deed.2”6

Accordingly, Claimants are freeholder and landlord of North Borneo and Respondent,
Malaysia, tenant under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed.

245. The Parties agreed that Respondent would pay an annual rent of 5,300 dollars
to Claimants for the exploitation by Respondent of the natural resources of North Borneo
pursuant to the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, which added 300
dollars to the annual rental determined in the 1878 Agreement, paid retroactively.
Respondent confirmed this view in its letter of September 19, 2019277 as follows:

«..6. ...From 1963 to 2012, that is, for an unbroken and continuous period of 49 years, Malaysia

246. The result of the evidence gathered in this arbitration confirmed that the
payment of the agreed rent under the 1878 Agreement was a matter of serious concern for
tenant. On November 27, 1946 (to wit, immediately after the signature of the 1946 North
Borneo Cession Agreement), the office of the Britain’s Prime Minister, Mr. Clement
Richard Atlee, sought information about?"*

«...the whereabouts of the private heirs of the late Sultan Mohammed -Jamalul Kiram of Sulu,
who died on the 10% -June, 1936. My object is to arrange for the resumption of the payment to
them of the annual grants of cession monies, formerly paid by the British North Borneo
(Chartered) Company...For your own strictly confidential information I hope that it will be
possible to resume payment of the cession monies without delay, since the alleged failure of the
North Borneo Company to pay these annual grants is being used as a pretext for claiming that
the concession granted to the Company by the late Sultan has terminated...».

There is no evidence in the proceedings to confirm that these annual payments ceased at
any moment.

Muhammad Esmail Kiram signed on November 25, 1957 a «...Proclamation...for himself
and on behalf of the heirs of Sultan Mohammad Jamalul Alam...» apparently terminating
the 1878 Agreement. In its pleadings of February 24, 2021, Claimants clarified that:

«...Sultan Esmail was one of the original nine Macashie Heirs. Consistent with Sultan Jamalul
Kiram II's will, he was awarded 1124th (4.17%) of the entitlement to payments under the 1878
Lease Agreement. His son, Sultan Fuad Kiram, inherited Sultan Esmail's entitlement under
the 1878 Lease Agreement; Sultan Fuad is one of the Claimants in this arbitration.

 

 

There is no evidence to confirm that Sultan Esmail was in fact speaking on behalf of all the
Heirs. Claimants, fmthermore, do not ratify his statement. Consequently, the 1957
Proclamation bears little relevance to this case...

Indeed, Respondent, Malaysia, disregarded this unilateral declaration and continued to
pay Claimants the annual rental of 5,300 dollars agreed in the 1878 Agreement and the
1903 Confirmatory Deed and pursuant to the Macaskie Judgment?” «...from 1968 to 2012,
that is, for an unbroken and continuous period of 49 years...».2°° It is the Arbitrator’s view
that Respondent continued to perform the 1878 Agreement —freely and without

 

reservations- until the end of 2012, as no one may set himself in contradiction with his
own previous conduct.?*! Articles 2.1.1 and 2.1.6 (3) of the UNIDROIT Principles apply, with

247. A party who performs a contract in accordance with its terms is thereby
discharged from its obligations under it and entitled to enforce the other party's
undertakings. The 1878 Agreement is valid and articulates binding reciprocal obligations
between landlord and tenant, between Claimants and Respondent, between the Parties.

Claimants allege that they have been complying with both the 1878 Agreement and the
1903 Confirmatory Deed. The result of the evidence in the arbitration confirms that
Claimants, as landlord, respected the leasehold articulated therein, as they deliver
possession of North Borneo to Respondent on their signature and since then allowed
Respondent to exploit the territory indefinitely, in accordance with terms of both the 1878
Agreement and 1903 Confirmatory Deed.

A breach of contract is committed when a party, without lawful excuse, fails or refuses to
perform what is due from it under the contract. It is the Arbitrator’s view that Malaysia’s
admitted failure to attend these payments since 2013 may be characterised as a
contractual non-performance under Article 7.1 of the UNIDROIT Principles, as it
establishes that the breach of a contractual obligation exists where it concurs a «...failure
by a party to perform any of its obligations under the contract...».

Article 7.3.1 (1) of the UNIDROIT Principles contains the general rule regarding the
termination of reciprocal obligations for breach of a fundamental contractual obligation in
the following terms: «...[a] party may terminate the contract where the failure of the other
party to perform an obligation under the contract amounts to a fundamental non-
performance...». Hence, Claimants are entitled to seek the termination of both the 1878
Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed.

The test is to determine whether the party who refuses to perform shows a justified or an
unjustified determination to disregard any essential term of the contract. Article 7.3.1.(2)
of the UNIDROIT Principles provides the alternative foundations?® to be applied in

«...determining whether a failure to perform an obligation amounts to a fundamental non-
performance regard shall be had, in particular, to whether

the non-performing party will suffer disproportionate loss as a result of the preparation
or performance if the contract is terminated...».

In the case at hand, it will be the burden of Respondent to establish —through the
submission of appropriate evidence before the Arbitrator- that its failure to attend the
payment under the 1878 Agreement was justified. However, Respondent ostensibly
admitted in § 9 of its letter of September 19, 2019 that «...[rlegrettably, payments [under
the 1878 Agreement] ceased in 2013...». The result of the evidence in this arbitration
shows that Respondent has been unable to demonstrate the concurrence of any lawful or
contractual excuse for its non-performance of its contractual duties under the 1878
Agreement and thus failed to comply with the indicated burden.?8*

This contractual non-performance deprived Claimants of payment of agreed rent under
the 1878 Agreement, without explanation. In its letter of September 19, 2019, Respondent
offered Claimants to resume this payment under the 1878 Agreement, but solely upon
Claimants’ withdrawal of this arbitration and the discontinuance of «...all proceedings
they have instituted in Spain (or indeed elsewhere) upon receipt of the arrears...”.

248. It is the Arbitrator’s view that Respondent’s breach of the 1878 Agreement is
material.?*+

The payment of the agreed rent under the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory
Deed consistently, in full and on time was Respondent’s most fundamental duty as
tenant.?8 Respondent failed to perform what was due under the 1878 Agreement and the
1903 Confirmatory Deed and it was unable to demonstrate the concurrence of any lawful
or contractual excuse for its non-performance of these contractual duties. On the contrary,
Respondent freely admitted that «...[rlegrettably, payments [under the 1878 Agreement
and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed] ceased in 2013...» and thus acknowledged its
responsibility in the causation of a serious contractual breach to the prejudice of
Claimants.

Consequently, pursuant to Article 7.3.1 (1) of the UNIDROIT Principles, the Arbitrator
declares the termination of the 1878 Agreement as of January 1, 2013.28°

i. The Parties’ Positions

250. Claimants plead that, being the 1878 Agreement being an international
private lease agreement and based on Article 7.3.5 of the UNIDROIT Principles, its
termination would require, in principle, that Respondent return the rights of exploitation
of the natural resources of the leased territory along the North Coast of Borneo to
Claimants.28’ However, Claimants «...acknowledge that restitution of the kind called for
above is essentially impossible. Malaysia considers Sabah to be its own by right of sovereign
prerogative; it is hardly about to surrender the Leased Territories, of any rights associated
therewith, no matter how compelling Claimants’ argument that the Sultan never ceded
Sabah and that sovereignty therefore remains in his descendants’ hands. Failing
restitution in kind, Claimants seek a sum of money for the loss of what should be theirs
after the 1878 Lease Agreement is over...».288

Claimants allege that, based on Articles 6.1.9.(4) and 7.4.12 of the UNIDROIT Principles,
that U.S. Dollars should be the currency to be used in the Final Award to calculate and to
determine the amount Claimants seek to recover from Respondent, to prevent them
«...from suffering further damages as a result of the interplay between Malaysia’s delay in
making payment and the fluctuation of exchange rates...».28%

 

As main remedy,

A. If the Final Award declares January 1, 2013 as the date of termination of both

amounts to USD 5.72 billion, or alternatively, to USD 4.29 billion, or
alternatively, to USD 2.86 billion, plus interest and so seek
reimbursement from Malaysia.29

As alternative relief, if the Final Award does not terminate the 1878 Agreement and the
1903 Confirmatory Deed and decides to restore their equilibrium, Claimants seek:

A. From January 1, 2013 to the date of the Final Award, as unpaid rent under the
1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, the amount of USD 5.72
billion, or alternatively, of USD 4.29 billion, or alternatively, of USD 2.86 billion,

B. The determination of all future annual rent payments in the rebalanced amount
of USD 714 million, or alternatively, of USD 535 million, or alternatively, of USD

an alternative remedy and alternative claim and an alternative remedy. Therefore, the
admissibility of the alternative claim will be examined only if the principal claim is
rejected.

253. Section VII.3.ii of this Final Award determined that the violation of
Respondent consisted, as it acknowledged, in the breach of its payment obligations of the
annual rent towards Claimants under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed —both characterised as a long term international private lease
agreement, of commercial nature- as of January 1, 2013. The consequences of the breach
of this private contract are subject to the applicable contract law, that the Partial Award
determined as being the UNIDROIT Principles.2%° The Arbitrator declared the termination
of the 1878 Agreement as of January 1, 2013, pursuant to Article 7.3.1 (1) of the UNIDROIT
Principles.2%*

254. The starting point of this assessment is the applicability of the principle of
restitution in kind to the present case.

Final Award

UNIDROIT Principles,?%" its termination would require, in theory, that Respondent returns
the rights of exploitation of the natural resources of the leased territory along the North
Coast of Borneo to Claimants.2%8 Indeed, upon the termination of the leasehold, the tenant
—Respondent in this matter- may revert the property possessed under the leasehold (i.e.,
North Borneo), in principle, to the landlord or to the freeholder, the Claimants.

However, it is the Arbitrator’s view that this effect should be contextualised with the
niceties of the present case.2°

The result of the evidence available in the proceedings shows that, through the
proclamation of Malaysia on September 16, 1963, North Borneo became the 13 State of
its Federation.® This situation did not prevent Respondent anyhow from continuing to
pay Claimants the annual rental of 5,300 dollars agreed in the 1878 Agreement and the
1903 Confirmatory Deed and pursuant to the Macaskie Judgment! «...from 1963 to 2012,
that is, for an unbroken and continuous period of 49 years...”, as Respondent admitted in
its letter of September 19, 2019.302

Regardless North Borneo being one of its States as from September 16, 1963 (an objective
fact of which existence Respondent was fully aware), Respondent continued to perform
both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed —freely and without
reservations- until the end of 2012. That contractual behaviour is significant in the
assessment of the disputed transaction in this arbitration. Respondent accepted this
situation and created a reasonable reliance of Claimants in relation to the 1878 Agreement
and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, the contractual relationship existing between the
Parties. As the Parties were certainly involved in an international business transaction —
a legal character that Respondent did not deny to Claimants on September 16, 1963 nor
thereafter- it is presumed that the negotiation, formation, performance and interpretation
of the 1878 Agreement and of the 1903 Confirmatory Deed is affected by the standard of
good faith and fair dealing in international trade, recognised by Article 1.7.(1) of the
UNIDROIT Principles.*° The principle of prohibition of inconsistent behaviour applies to
the Parties and, specifically, to Respondent.*

27 UNIDRoI? Principles, Article 7.3.6.(1): «...On termination of a contract to be performed at one time either party may claim

Aware of this situation, Claimants still «...acknowledge that restitution of the kind called

commercial rights before Respondent under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed.

 

».305 Claimants hence confirmed that their claim

 

255. Claimants allege that, because of the aforementioned situation, «...it is
therefore safe to assume that «restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate» in
accordance with Article 7.3.6...»°°° of the UNIDROIT Principles. The Judgement of the
International Court of Justice of September 13, 1928, rendered in the Factory of Chorzow
case, establishes compensation as prevalent remedy in those cases where, as occurs here,
restitution in kind is not possible or inappropriate.*°” According to its { 125, if restitution
—as Claimants admitted- is not possible, the financial equivalent of this restitution should
be paid:

«...Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value

which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for I sustained

 

which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the
principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary
to international law...».

Article 7.3.6.(2) of the UNIDROIT Principles endorses this principle as follows: «...[f
restitution in kind is not possible or appropriate, an allowance has to be made in money
whenever reasonable...». In its commentary, UNIDROIT clarifies that «...the allowance will
normally amount to the value of the performance received...» and thus ratifies that the
principle enunciated by the Factory of Chorzow case uses the criteria of fair market value
at the time when restitution was due;*°8 in the present case, as of January 1, 2013. The
fair market value is a widely accepted basis of value and can be defined as the amount at
which property would change hands between a willing seller and a willing buyer when
neither is acting under compulsion and when both have reasonable knowledge of the
relevant facts.

Final Award

256. It is a general principle of international law that any breach of an engagement
involves an obligation to make reparation of the actual and specific harm caused by an
unlawful act.

Damages represent the remedy for contract violation. Article 7.4.1 of the UNIDROIT
Principles enunciates this general right to damages as follows: «...Any non-performance
gives the aggrieved party a right to damages either exclusively or in conjunction with any
other remedies except where the non-performance is excused under these Principles...».

The monetary sums awarded for this reason seek to place the aggrieved party in the same
pecuniary position that it would have been if the contract had been performed in the
manner provided for by the parties at the time of conclusion. These monetary sums are
equivalent to the harm caused to the aggrieved party. Its calculation should follow the
general principle of full reparation, formulated in the Factory of Chorzow case, as follows:

«...The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act -a principle which
seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral
tribunals.

  

is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal
act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had
not been committed...».30

Based on this Judgement, Article 7.4.2. (1) of the UNIDROIT Principles emphasises that
«...[t]he aggrieved party is entitled to full compensation for harm sustained as a result of
the non-performance. Such harm includes both any loss which it suffered and any gain of
which it was deprived, taking into account any gain to the aggrieved party resulting from
its avoidance of cost or harm...». Although Claimants are entitled to whatever damages
result directly from Respondent’s failure to comply with both the 1878 Agreement and the
1903 Confirmatory Deed, the compensatory nature of damages sought to establish that
they must be a source neither of gain nor of loss for the aggrieved party.

Claimants —the aggrieved party- have the burden of demonstrating in this arbitration the
sufficient causal relationship between an event which may equate to a failure to perform
any of the contractual undertakings and the specific breach alleged, as that right to
damages arises from the sole existence of non-performance.*!° Respondent admitted that
«..[rlegrettably, payments [under the 1878 Agreement] ceased in 2013...»°"1, without
excuse. Respondent therefore recognized the non-performance of its payment obligations
of the annual rent towards Claimants under both the 1878 Agreement and the 1903
Confirmatory Deed as of January 1, 2013, and so discharged Claimants of their burden of
proving in this arbitration the existence of this relationship.

257. Section VII.1.ii.B of this Final Award established that the 1878 Agreement
and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed were constituted for an undetermined period of time and
thus conform long term contracts under Article 1.11 of the UNCITRAL Principles.*!2

Article 7.3.7.(1) of the UNIDROIT Principles*!* contains a special rule applicable to long-
term contracts, which excludes restitution for performance made in the past and remits to
the provisions of Article 7.3.6 of the UNIDROIT Principles. In § 454 of the Statement of
Claim, Claimants complied with this rule, as they allege that «...[i]f the Sole Arbitrator
deems the 1878 Lease Agreement terminated from January 2018, all economic benefits from

 

then onward should form part of the restitution value (since Claimants would have
collected those economic benefits if Malaysia had tendered restitution upon
termination)...». Respondent did not rebut this allegation in the arbitration and, therefore,
it must be considered as validly made, within the boundaries of Article 7.3.7.(1) of the
UNIDROIT Principles.

258. Claimants allege that «...Brattle makes its calculations in U.S. dollars because
the industries at issue are indexed to U.S. dollars. Moreover, production of oil, gas and
palm oil is mainly intended for export, and therefore paid abroad in U.S. dollars. As a
result, damages should be calculated in U.S. dollars...».2\4

Based on Articles 6.1.92!5 and 7.4.123!6 of the UNIDROIT Principles, Claimants allege that
U.S. Dollars should be the currency of payment to be used in the Final Award to calculate
and to determine the amount Claimants seek to recover form Respondent as a consequence
of the termination of the 1878 Agreement.

UNIDROIT Principles, Article 1.11: «... «long-term contract» refers to a contract which is to be performed over a period of
time and which normally involves, to a varying degree, complexity of the transaction and an ongoing relationship between
the parties...». Its commentary clarifies the «...elements [that] typically distinguish long-term contracts from ordinary
exchange contracts: duration of the contract, an ongoing relationship between the parties, and complexity of the
transaction. For the purpose of the Principles, the essential element is the duration of the contract...».

UNIDROIT Principles, Article 7.3.7: «...(1) On termination of a long-term contract restitution can only be claimed for the
period after termination has taken effect, provided the contract is divisible. (2) As far as restitution has to be made, the
provisions of Article 7.3.6 apply...».

convertible; or (b) the parties have agreed that payment should be made only in the currency in which the monetary
obligation is expressed.

 

 

 

(2) If it is impossible for the obligor to make payment in the currency in which the monetary obligation is expressed, the
obligee may require payment in the currency of the place for payment, even in the case referred to in paragraph (1)(b).
(3) Payment in the currency of the place for payment is to be made according to the applicable rate of exchange prevailing
there when payment is due.

(4) However, if the obligor has not paid at the time when payment is due, the obligee may require payment according to
the applicable rate of exchange prevailing either when payment is due or at the time of actual payment....».

UNIDROIT Principles, Article 7.4.12: «...Damages are to be assessed either in the currency in which the monetary
obligation was expressed or in the currency in which the harm was suffered, whichever is more appropriate...».

Final Award

Provided that the principle of full compensation is respected, Claimants are entitled to
choose the currency to be used to calculate the compensation sought.

The result of the available evidence in these proceedings, along with the absence of any
rebuttal on the part of Respondent, confirm that Claimants’ choice is made in accordance
with this principle and with aforementioned provisions of the UNIDORIT Principles.
Claimants made this election with the aim to prevent them «...from suffering further
damages as a result of the interplay between Malaysia’s delay in making payment and the
fluctuation of exchange rates...»*!7 and hence it does not subject Claimants to further
losses.

Claimant therefore seek «...their compensation in U.S. dollars, which is the appropriate
currency under the circumstances. This choice binds the Sole Arbitrator...».318

259. The concrete valuation inherent in the principle of full reparation according
to the criteria provided in the Factory of Chorzow case requires also the assessment of
developments occurred after the contractual breach.

The UNIDROIT Principles demand damages representing the full amount of what was
agreed in the contract, regardless of the reasons of the breach and regardless of what was
damnun emergens and lucrum cessans. Its Article 7.3.6.(2) emphasises that an allowance
in money should be reasonable. It condenses the principle of good faith and fair dealing
provided by Article 1.7.(1) of the UNIDROIT Principles.*!9

As the UNIDROIT Principles should focus on the market value at the time restitution is
due, the determination of the valuation date is a relevant factor to consider in the
calculation.®2° On that basis and given the long-term nature of the 1878 Agreement and
the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, it is the Arbitrator’s view that, in the present case, Claimants
have the right to ask for the fair market value at the date of the violation of the 1878
Agreement, to wit, as of January 1, 2013 onwards. Only those subsequent factors and their
negative consequences connected to the breach should be included in this calculation, with
the aim to arrive as closely as possible at the situation Claimants would be in absence of
the breach.*”! For that purpose, Claimants allege that «...all economic benefits from then
onward should form part of the restitution value (since Claimants would have collected
those economic benefits if Malaysia had tendered restitution upon termination)...».*22 This
pretension, which Respondent did not contend in this arbitration, is aligned with the

special rule contained in Article 7.3.7.(1) of the UNIDROIT Principles and, therefore, valid
and legitimate.*?3

260. The standard of proof on the existence and amount of damages claimed
includes (i) their existence, (ii) their exact calculation and (iii) their causal relationship
with the specific breach alleged. The Final Award already determined the causal
relationship and the existence of Claimant’s entitlement to damages sought in this
arbitration. Therefore, their exact calculation is the only issue pending of assessment by
the Arbitrator.

261. 9 566 to 569 of the Brddermann Report II -which Respondent did not rebut
in this arbitration- provide the applicable criteria for this calculation as follows:324

 

«...566. To determine the quantum of an allowance in money instead of restitution in kind under
a reasonableness-test, regard is to be had to the market value of performance far the lessee, As
the exploitation of rights over the Territory has a value for the lessee such value needs to be
determined.

 

567. Again, the criteria in article 4.3 can assist. The nature and purpose of the 1878 Lease
Agreement (article 4.3 lit. d) - ie., to exploit the Territory indefinitely - requires, in case of
termination under article 6.2.3 (4)(a), that an allowance in money would need to reflect in one
sum the indefinite commercial exploitation of the Territory if restitution in kind is impossible
or inappropriate. Thus, it would require to not only consider the actual value generated by the
lessee between the date of termination and today, but also the value far the lessee in the future.

568, Furthermore, applying the reasonableness-test, the Sale Arbitrator may wish to consider
that, even if the lessor would receive the rights over the Territory back in their entirety, it would
not be able to exercise those rights of exploitation alone. This may require a splitting the revenues
between the farmer lessor and the farmer lessee. Good faith and fair dealing (article 1. 7) suggest
that the lessor should be awarded at least the share which it would receive if the farmer lessee
were to agree with him on a modus to exploit the Territory with due regard to market conditions.
In this context, the Sole Arbitrator might also have regard to usages in the industry (articles 4.3
lit. f, 1.9 (2)), e.g. to what kind of revenue splitting is usual in the trade of oil and gas or
industrial palm oil exploitation...».

 

 

262. Claimants prepared the damage computations and their quantifications, based
on both the Brattle Report and the Meehan Report, submitted to the proceedings.
Respondent did not rebut this expert evidence, nor did it offer any expert witness to cross
examine regarding the contents of both the Meehan Report and the Brattle Report.

 

UNIDROIT Principles, Article 7.3.7: «...(1) On termination of a long-term contract restitution can only be claimed for the
period after termination has taken effect, provided the contract is divisible. (2) As far as restitution has to be made, the

Agreement be terminated, Counsel for the Claimants has also asked us to compute the
restitution value to the heirs of the Sultan of Sulu from Malaysia’s failure in light of the
significant and unanticipated economic value created by oil and gas, and palm oil
production...». 26 Mr. Lapuerta was made witness available for cross examination
regarding the Bratttle Report.

265. The basis of valuation —critical to understanding valuation in this arbitration
context- defines the fundamental assumptions on which the value will be based. The
Meehan Report —properly supported as expert evidence- concludes that the assumptions
of the valuation contained in the Brattle Report are substantively correct on the oil and
gas fields assessed and their upside producing potential remining and consistent with the
reserves to production ratios. On that basis, the Meehan Report embodies the calculations
contained in the Brattle Report as conservative.*27

266. It is the Arbitrator’s views that the Brattle Report, after the establishment of
the basis of value, selects the method of valuation defined, explains the result achieved
through its assessment, and submits appropriate documentation in support of its analysis.

In its § 25, the Brattle Report declares that «...Counsel for the Claimants has instructed
us to limit our analysis of economic benefits to the oil and natural gas, and palm oil
industries...». ®88 According to this scope, the Brattle Report considers that «...the
restitution value should represent only a portion of the total economic benefits to Malaysia,
reflecting that neither the Sultan of Sulu in 1878 nor the Claimants as of today are in a
position to manage the Leased Territory. Counsel for the Claimants has instructed us to
assume that the Claimants should receive a percentage entitlement of 10%, 15% or 20% of
the economic benefits from the Leased Terrvitory...».329

Final Award

The valuation of contract damages should be based in the actual harm incurred and should
follow a subjective and concrete approach in accordance with the specific principle of full
reparation under international law, contract law and with the UNIDROIT Principles
previously indicated. Along these lines of action, § 111 of the Brattle Report discloses that
it followed «...recommended best practice in financial valuation and use the Capital Asset
Pricing Model («CAPM») to derive risk-adjusted discount rates. The analysis follows the
standard approach of determining the discount rate by reference to the historical stock price
performance of comparable companies and financial assets. Appendix E describes in detail
our discount rate calculations...». The Brattle Report refers to the income capitalization
approach, a valuation method, based on the economic principle of anticipation of benefits,
which includes the application of a discount factor —one of the most widely used types of
the Discounted Cash Flow method- that helps to calculate the present value of an amount
of money expected in the future.**° This approach is in accordance the principle of fair
market value contained in the Factory of Chorzow case.

267. Article 7.4.4 of the UNIDROIT Principles**! should be taken into account and
be analysed in accordance with Exhibits C 35 and C 36.

Exhibit C 35 is a letter dated April 28, 2017 sent by Claimants to Respondent, where
Claimants indicated that

«...the discovery of game-changing petroleum resources in the region. The last resulted in
additional revenue to Malaysia massive that it would have been inconceivable in scope and
scale to the original signatories.

Those resource discoveries -fist oil, then more recently natural gas- have utterly transformed
the complexion of the region. They were unforeseeable and unexploitable at the time of
conc-JJusion of the 1878 Agreement, and they have fundamentally unbalanced the equilibrium
of the bargain in the 1878 Agreement.

We are thus now in a position where the heirs receive the equivalent of Us$1,200 annually in
connection with territory that (even with today's lower oil and gas prices) produces
approximately 20 million times that much in annual revenue from petroleum resources. If ever
there were a case for the renegotiation of an agreement that had become fundamentally
unbalanced due to changed circumstances, this is it....».

 

Exhibit C 36 is another letter sent by Claimants to Respondent on July 2, 2018, where
Claimants stated that «...[t]he core of my clients' claim is that the contract with the Sultan
of Sulu allowed for the payment of annual compensation for all lost revenue to the Sultan
from what is now, essentially, Sabah. The laws in force when and where the agreement
were signed, and today, allow for this to be adjusted as circumstances radically change

Final Award

(which of course they have). The payments have never been so adjusted, and the cumulative
debt is nominally in the region of RM 2 trillion...».

Claimants offered negotiations to Respondent in both letters. Respondent simply ignored
this reiterated offer and provided instead no answer to either of them. The contents of
these Exhibits show, in the Arbitrator’s opinion, that Claimant informed Respondent of
the situation concerning the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed and on
their potential financial consequences if Respondent refused to enter into any negotiation
with Claimants and the dispute were to be submitted to arbitration, as has finally
occurred.

The parties to a contract are always expected to act according to what is reasonable in
view of the nature of their relationship, their economic interest and their legitimate
expectations. § 603 of the Brédermann Report II identifies the consequences to be derived
from Respondent’s conduct, in the context of the UNIDROIT Principles, as follows: «...The
refusal to react to any request to renegotiation gives ground for a claim for damages under
article 7.4.1 et seq. because it constitutes non-performance to cooperate under article 5.1.3.
The amount of damages will need to be calculated on the basis of the principles of full
compensation (article 7.4.2) certainty of harm (article 7.4.3) and foreseeability (article
7.4.4). Each refusal to renegotiate may constitute an individual act of non-performance
giving rise to damages. It is sensible to include within these damages the legal costs of an
arbitration to terminate or rebalance the agreement...»

268. The Final Award declares January 1, 2013 as the date of termination of the
1878 Agreement and of the 1903 Confirmatory Deed. Claimants’ seek, as main remedy,
the recognition of their entitlement to the restitution value of the rights over the leased
territory along North Borneo, with pre-award interest as of January 1, 2013, of USD 32.20
billion, or alternatively, of USD 24.15 billion, or alternatively, of USD 16.10 billion and so
seek reimbursement from Malaysia.

269. The Brattle Reports concludes that each field in Sabah produces crude oil of
unique quality. The oil production in this territory amounted to 1,916 million barrels from
1965 to February 2020 and forecasts an additional 1,154 million barrels of oil production
from February 2020 to 2044, equivalent to an additional 60% relative to historical
production. Based on the financial commitment which represent future contracts for Brent
deliveries as far as 2029, the Brattle Report calculates «...the economic benefits to Malaysia
based on the EIA’s reference or base case, which forecasts a Brent price of USD 96 per barrel
(in 2019 prices) in 2044, equivalent to USD 156 per barrel in nominal terms...».*82
Respondent did not rebut these figures in the arbitration and was unable to assess an
alternative value. The calculations contained the Brattle Report are correct and accurate.

270. The Brattle Report determines that gas production amounted to 364 million
barrels of oil equivalent through January 2020 and forecasts a further 1,365 million
barrels of oil equivalent in gas production from 2020 to 2044, equivalent to another 375%.
It also states that gas production in Sabah nevertheless expanded significantly in late
2014, following the construction of the Sabah-Sarawak pipeline and the development of a
cluster of gas fields, which gathers most of the offshore gas from Sabah and transports it
to Petronas’s Bintulu liquefaction facility in Sarawak for liquefaction and onward export
as LNG.

271. The Brattle Report fixes the lifecycle costs around USD 18 per barrel for oil
only fields, around USD 8 to 14 per barrel of oil equivalent for gas only fields, and between
UsD 18 and 23 per barrel of oil equivalent for oil and gas producing fields.**? Respondent
did not rebut these figures in the arbitration and was unable to assess an alternative
value. The calculations contained the Brattle Report are correct and accurate.

272. Respondent has promoted the cultivation of oil palm trees in Sabah since the
1960s and saw an overall expansion since 1975.

The Brattle Report concludes that Respondent obtained significant economic benefits from
this cultivation under the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed and will
continue to generate significant tax and other income for the Malaysian Government, as
Malaysian upstream palm oil producers paid corporate income tax at a rate of 25% before
2014, after which the rate decreased to 24%. Additionally, Respondent collects an export
duty of approximately 20% from producers of crude palm oil and crude palm kernel oil
prior to 2013. The effective export duty rate for crude palm oil was approximately 20%
prior to 2013. Respondent implemented a new export duty structure in 2013, reduced the
effective duty rate on crude palm oil to less than 5% and effectively eliminated export taxes
on crude palm kernel oil. Malaysia finally collects an excess profit tax from crude palm oil
producers, which depends on the level of crude palm oil prices.**4

The Brattle Report indicates that «...unlike oil and gas, we know of no independent study
of palm oil production disruption risks. We therefore apply the same haircut to the
production to palm oil in Sabah, as we did to the production of oil and gas. The assumption
is that events which could disrupt palm oil production would be similar in frequency,
duration and magnitude to those likely to disrupt oil and gas production...».3*>

The Brattle Report concludes that, in accordance with its calculations, «...Malaysia will
receive total undiscounted cash flows of more than USD 2.75 billion from 2020 until 2030.
We estimate a corresponding present value of USD 9.12 billion out to perpetuity, equivalent
to MYR 37.94 billion at the prevailing USD/ MYR spot exchange rate...».3°6

Respondent did not rebut these figures in the arbitration and was unable to assess an
alternative value. The calculations contained the Brattle Report are correct and accurate.

273. Claimants seek to determine their share based on a comparative analysis of
«.,.the royalty rates of various countries, the practices and promises of the Federal and State
Governments of Malaysia and Sabah with respect to their royalties, and the historical
expectations of the Sultanate’s revenue stream...Claimants consider a restitution value that
reflects 20% ..., 15%...or 10%...0f Malaysia’s economic benefit from the Leased Territories
to be appropriate...”,®*7 in this order of preference.

The option of 20% royalty rate should be disregarded, as Claimants admit in their analysis
that «...[gliven the current state of federal Malaysian politics, it is unclear when or whether
the 20% rate will apply...».38

The option of 10% share to Malaysia’s economic benefits should also be discarded, as
Claimants consider that «...[t]his 10% share is equivalent to the 10% royalty levied by
Malaysia on the value of all oil and gas produced in Sabah. The 10% is also close to the
ratio of the Dent Brothers’ estimate of the territory’s value, compared with the Sultan’s
annual lease payments according to their correspondence, as well as the ratio of those
annual payments to the Company’s annual revenue in its first reported year...».°°9

Therefore, it is the Arbitrator’s view that the option of the 15% share to Malaysia’s
economic benefits is the more appropriate to comply with the criteria of the UNIDROIT
Principles, as explained in the preceding paragraphs. Claimants admit that «...[flifteen
percent includes the 10% royalty the Malaysian government levies on the value of all oil
and gas produced in Sabah, and the newly imposed 5% sales tax on petroleum products
instituted by the Sabah government in April 2020, pursuant to the State Sales Tax
Ordinance 1998...».34°

274. On this basis and pursuant to Article 7.4.11.(1) of the UNIDROIT Principles,**"
the Brattle Report concludes that the restitution value payable to Claimants since
January 1, 2013 to February 2020 under the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory
Deed is USD 4.87 billion, including pre-award interest,*42 corresponding to a 15% of the
historical benefits obtained by Respondent during that period (i.e., USD 32.49 billion). The
Brattle Report also concludes «...that Malaysia should pay to the Claimants in restitution
of the stream of expected economic benefits from Sabah now lost to the Claimants...from
continued oil and gas development in Sabah out to a 2044 horizon...» and «...from the
ongoing cultivation of oil palms in Sabah out to perpetuity...» (i.e., USD 66.99 billion) the
amount of USD 10.05 billion, corresponding to a 15% sharing factor.*4*

275. Claimants also sought compensation from Respondent, in the amount of USD
9.23 billion, as the estimated future economic benefits and revenue that Respondent
would, in their opinion, continue to produce after 2044. Claimants maintain that «... [i]f
these future economic benefits are not included within the restitution value to be paid to
Claimants, they would obviously be undercompensated...».44

This claim cannot be upheld, as it is composed of an assessment of an estimation of future
costs projections and therefore, contrary to Article 7.4.3 of the UNIDROIT Principles.*4*

Material damages are calculated as the financial or economic equivalent of the loss caused
to Claimants and therefore compensation for damages will only cover the damages that
Claimants are able to prove before the Arbitrator, respecting their compensatory nature.

The damage for which compensation is sought must be real and certain and be properly
proven. Claimants submitted an assessment of the estimated future, as they admit that
«...contingent fields have not yet been developed...»*4® and that «...[fluture economic
benefits beyond 2044 cannot be precisely quantified...».°*7 In this regard, the Brattle
Report concludes that «...given the extent of available information, we cannot assess with

Jointly considered, these statements confirm that damages sought by Claimants on this
basis do not rest on sufficiently certain economic projections, with sufficient degree of
certainty. They can be characterised as future damages, which cannot be recognised as
such.

These reasons, jointly considered, justify the rejection of this Claimants’ claim.

276. For the reasons detailed above and on the result of the evidence presented in
this arbitration, the Arbitrator concludes that Claimants are entitled to recover from
Respondent the restitution value of the rights over the leased territory along North Borneo
under the 1878 Agreement and the 1903 Confirmatory Deed, with pre-award interest of
3,96% per annum, as of January 1, 2013 until 2044 in the amount of USD 14.92 billion.

Pursuant to Article 11.2.1 of the UNIDROIT Principles*° in relation to apportion of
performance in cases of several obligees, Claimants admit that their rights are joint and
several and, on that basis, kindly consider that the «...Arbitrator need only award the full
amount to Claimants, and thereafter Claimants can distribute the proceeds among
themselves...”.°°° This petition is upheld, as Respondent fails to provide any position on

ii. The Arbitrator’s Analysis and Findings

280. Post-award and pre-award interest should be handled in a different manner
in the present matter. Section VII.4.ii of this Final Award dealt with the issue of pre-award
interest.

281. Post-award interest, different from pre-award interest, begins to accrue after
the Final Award defines the final amount with certainty and the payment obligation is
established. From that moment on, there is a payment obligation so that Respondent is
simply in default if it does not fulfil this obligation.

282. Respondent agreed «...to paying simple interest of 10% p.a. on the annual
payments for each of the years concerned...». Claimants made no objection and therefore
the offer made by Respondent should be considered as accepted. The Arbitrator finds that
this rate is reasonable. The Arbitrator orders Respondent to pay interest at a rate of 10%
per annum, calculated on a simple basis (i.e., non—compound).

283. Considering the significant amount of damages which Respondent owes to
Claimants, Respondent is given a grace period of three months as from the date of the
Final Award in which no interest will accrue for it to address the financial and
administrative necessities for the payment of the amount of damages determined in the
Final Award. After the expiration of such grace period, the simple rate determined in the
Final Award will apply until full payment of the sums awarded to Claimants.

Respondent failed to provide any views on the issue. The Arbitrator will render a decision
on the costs of the merits phase on the arbitration in this Final Award.

285. Claimants’ argument, based on the principle of costs follow the event, seek that
Respondent bear the costs of the arbitration. Claimants also consider Respondent’s
obstructive behavior in these proceedings as another factor to be aseesed when allocating
costs, which Claimants pleaded as follows:

«...578. The Sole Arbitrator should take Malaysia's obstructive behavior into account when
making a decision on costs. Malaysia's egregious conduct includes the following:

 

@ Claimants repeatedly, but unsuccessfully, sought to avoid the submission of this
dispute to an arbitrator by attempting to engage in negotiations of the 1878 Lease
Agreement. Malaysia failed even to reply to Claimants’ repeated requests. Therefore,
Malaysia breached its duty to engage in renegotiations under both the 1878 Lease
Agreement and Article 6.2.3(3) of the UniproiT Principles. Prof. Brédermann
confirms that Malaysia’s evasive behavior is a violation of said provision of the
Uniproir Principles.

(ii) During the arbitration, Malaysia has refused to take part in the proceedings by
failing to appoint legal counsel and to respond to the Sole Arbitrator’s
instructions.714 Out of nowhere, Malaysia appointed the law firm Herbert Smith
Freehills (Hs) mere hours after the fi
in the proceeding for a few weeks and then renounced its representation. Th

caused substantial unnecessary delay and work, also affecting the merits part of
this arbitration, which would otherwise be considerably more advanced by now.

(iii) Malaysia has failed to pay its portion of the deposits for this arbitration, forcing
Claimants to pay all such deposits.

(iv) Despite its official non-app in the pi ings, Malaysia has s lly
sent intimidatory communications addressed to Claimants and the Sole Arbitrator,

often containing threats.

(v) Malaysia has self-servingly sought an anti-suit injunction in the courts of its own

 

territory, which has led to further intimidatory and coercive visits to, and ex parte

communications with, the Sole Arbitrator.

 

(vi) Malaysia’s conduct has substantially increased the costs of the proceedings by
forcing Claimants to serve Malaysia hard copies of their submissions at no fewer
than 5 different addresses to ensure safe receipt.

579. For more than two years, beginning with Claimants’ notice of intent to commence
arbitration dated 2 November 201,720 Malaysia’s tactics have ranged from obstinate silence,
to overt defiance of the Court's and the Sole Arbitrator’s jurisdiction, to disingenuous delay
tactics, and ultimately to illegal attempts to intimidate the Sole Arbitrator. Despite these tactics,
the Sole Arbitrator generously offered Malaysia every opportunity to participate in the arbitral
process and put forward its position. Malaysia has snubbed the Sole Arbitrator at every turn,
either with aggressive threats of contempt of court, or with stubborn silence, All thi:
bad faith, at the very least...

 

plain

286. Article 37.6 of the SAA provides as follows:

«...Subject to the agreement of the parties, the arbitrators shall decide in the award on the costs
of the arbitration, which shall include the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and, where
applicable, the fees and expenses of counsel or representatives of the parties, the cost of the
services provided by the institution administering the arbitration and the other expenses of the

arbitral proceedings...».

Based on these guidelines, the term costs, in the case at hand, includes:

A.

B.

The fees of the Arbitrator and his reasonable expenses incurred;
The legal and other costs incurred by the Parties in relation to the arbitration,
to the extent that the Arbitrator determines that the amount of such costs is

reasonable;

The reasonable costs of expert advice of the Parties;

. The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such

expenses are approved by the Arbitrator; and

The expenses related to the organisation of the proceedings.

287. It is acknowledged that the successful party is entitled to prosecute or defend
its claims in the manner it considers necessary and appropriate, and arguably the party

and its representatives are best placed to evaluate what resources are required to win the
case. However, it will remain within the arbitrator’s discretion to decide whether or not
that party will recover its costs in full, according to the reasonability of the expenses

incurred and to allocate the costs, weighting the concurring circumstances as he considers

relevant.

When allocating costs in international commercial arbitration it may be necessary to

consider other circumstances, where relevant, including the extent to which each party
conducted the arbitration in an expeditious and cost-effective manner.

Final Award

In the present case, Respondent’s reiterated and unjustified refusal to comply with the
deadlines granted were, amongst others, circumstances that contributed to delay the
conduct of this arbitration and to incur additional costs. Claimants submitted extensive
and supported pleadings, which were not rebutted by Respondent. Respondent’s
procedural conduct has substantially —and, in the Arbitrator’s view, unnecessarily-
increased the amount of time the Arbitrator and each Party has had to devote to these
proceedings of the arbitration to determine the debated issues contained in the Final
Award. The relevance of the grounds raised by Respondent proved to be of limited
importance for the proceedings.

The Arbitrator has considered all the circumstances to determine the most appropriate
allocation of costs in this arbitration.

288. As a rule, a party may seek reimbursement of its legal and other costs so far
as those have been incurred in connection with these proceedings of the arbitration; to wit,
only expenses which were necessary for the preparation of the case and directly linked to
the filing of the arbitration will be considered costs of the arbitration.

The Arbitrator needs to be satisfied that a cost was incurred specifically for the purpose
of pursuing the arbitration, has been paid or is payable, and was reasonable.

The Claimants submitted a summary of detailed costs incurred in this merits phase of the
arbitration, including both Counsel (i.e. 4-5 Gray’s Inn, B. Cremades & Asociados
