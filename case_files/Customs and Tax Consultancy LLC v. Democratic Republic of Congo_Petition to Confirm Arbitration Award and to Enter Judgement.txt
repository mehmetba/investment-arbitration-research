JURISDICTION AND VENUE

10. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to two statutory bases: first, 28
U.S.C. § 1330(a) and 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6); and second, 9 U.S.C. § 203.

11. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) to
confirm an arbitral award against a foreign state provided that the foreign state does not have
immunity. Title 28 U.S.C. § 1330(a) states:

The district courts shall have original jurisdiction without regard to
amount in controversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign
state as defined in section 1603(a) of this title as to any claim for
relief in personam with respect to which the foreign state is not

entitled to immunity either under sections 1605-1607 of this title or
under any applicable international agreement.

28 U.S.C. § 1330(a).
12. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is not entitled to immunity because this is

an action under 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6) to confirm an arbitration award under the New York

Case 1:18-cv-01408-RJL Document1 Filed 06/14/18 Page 5 of 16

Convention, a treaty providing for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards to which
the United States is a party.
13. The Arbitral Award is governed by the New York Convention because: (i) the
award arose from a commercial legal relationship between the parties; (ii) there was an
agreement in writing to arbitrate any dispute(s) arising from that relationship; (iii) the agreement
provided for arbitration proceedings to take place in France, a signatory to the New York
Convention; and (iv) at least one of the parties is not an American citizen. See 9 U.S.C. § 202.
14. The Democratic Republic of the Congo is also not entitled to immunity because
the Democratic Republic of the Congo expressly waived “any immunity of any kind whatsoever”
in the dispute resolution clause of the contract giving rise to liability here.
15. The second basis for this Court’s subject matter jurisdiction is Section 203 of the
Federal Arbitration Act, which provides jurisdiction to enforce an arbitration award governed by
the New York Convention stating:
An action or proceeding falling under the Convention shall be
deemed to arise under the laws and treaties of the United States.
The district courts of the United States (including the courts
enumerated in section 460 of title 28) shall have original
jurisdiction over such an action or proceeding, regardless of the
amount in controversy.

9 U.S.C. § 203.

16. This Court has personal jurisdiction over the Democratic Republic of the Congo
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1330(b), which provides that personal jurisdiction over a foreign state
shall exist as to every claim for relief for which the district court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.

§ 1330(a) and where service has been made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1608. Petitioner is serving

the Democratic Republic of the Congo pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1608.

17. Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4), which provides
that a civil action against a foreign state may be brought in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia.

FACTS
The Democratic Republic of the Congo attempts to reform

18. The Democratic Republic of the Congo’s Customs and Excise Office (“OFIDA,”
as it was then called)” was charged by Congolese law with the duty to collect duties, taxes, and
fees of a customs and fiscal nature; collect existing and future excise taxes; patrol the borders;
investigate and establish customs and excise infractions and violations of the statutes in
connection therewith; and train personnel in modern management techniques in the customs and
excise field. OFIDA operated under the supervision of the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s
Finance Minister.

19. In 2003, OFIDA undertook a customs reform and modernization program with the
International Monetary Fund (“IMF”).

20. In 2007, at OFIDA’s request, the World Customs Organization (“WCO”)
conducted a diagnostic mission to, among other things, enhance OFIDA’s capabilities. The
WCO coordinated with the IMF representatives in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

21. In November 2007, as part of a broader report of various economic sectors in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, the IMF concluded that the reform of OFIDA was

insufficient.

? OFIDA is an acronym of the office’s name in French: Office des Douanes et Accises.

The Democratic Republic of the Congo contracts with
CTC and then breaches the Contract

22. In June 2008, the Democratic Republic of the Congo entered into a Technical
Assistance Contract (the “Contract”’) with CTC.

23. CTC counted among its principals the consultant who had been responsible for
the successful customs reforms that had been executed in Angola and Mozambique.

24. Per the terms of the Contract, CTC was to deploy a team of experts to support
OFIDA’s operations in the field, inspect goods exported and imported, conduct a post-customs
clearance audit, and combat customs fraud through investigations and intelligence gathering—
with the goals of obtaining an immediate and lasting increase in customs receipts and to
transform OFIDA into a modern and efficient customs department consistent with the highest
international standards as defined by the WCO.

25. The Contract also required CTC to propose an appropriately revised statutory and
regulatory framework that would both encourage trade and protect the Congolese state and
people.

26. The Contract required the Democratic Republic of the Congo to, among other
things, make timely payment to CTC and ensure OFIDA cooperated in CTC’s efforts.

27. The Democratic Republic of the Congo repeatedly failed to meet its financial
obligations under the Contract. For example, the Democratic Republic of the Congo failed to
make full payment due for even the mobilization payment due to CTC.

28. The Democratic Republic of the Congo repeatedly failed to meet its obligation to
ensure OFIDA officials cooperated with CTC’s efforts. Instead, OFIDA attempted to impede
CTC’s performance of the Contract. For example, OFIDA refused to assist CTC in fighting

corruption within OFIDA.

Case 1:18-cv-01408-RJL Document1 Filed 06/14/18 Page 8 of 16

29. After repeated efforts to resolve the situation, CTC terminated the Contract on
January 15, 2010. The letter of termination further stated that it constituted notice of a dispute
pursuant to Clause 24 of the Contract.

The Arbitration
30. At Clause 24, the Contract includes an arbitration agreement that provides:

Any dispute that may arise concerning the formation, performance,
construction or termination of this Contract shall be first resolved
amicably by direct negotiations between the two contracting
Parties.

Tf at the end of a three (3) month period from the date notice of a
dispute is given by one party to the other party the two contracting
parties have not reached an agreement to resolve their dispute,
either party may submit the dispute to arbitration by an Arbitral
Tribunal appointed in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of
the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The Arbitral
Tribunal shall comprise three arbitrators appointed in accordance
with said Rules. The seat of arbitration shall be Paris and the
language of arbitration shall be French. The parties shall comply
with any arbitration award and, accordingly, the State expressly
waives any immunity of any kind whatsoever.

31. A copy of Clause 24 of the Contract is attached to the Honlet Declaration as
Exhibit 7. A certified translation of Clause 24 is set out in the certified translation of the Partial
Award at page 10, in Exhibit 2 to the Honlet Declaration.

32. On May 31, 2013, CTC submitted to the ICC a request for arbitration against the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.

33. Both CTC and the Democratic Republic of the Congo nominated arbitrators who
served on the Arbitral Tribunal alongside the Tribunal President, who was appointed by the ICC.

34. Both CTC and the Democratic Republic of the Congo were represented by

counsel in the arbitration.

Case 1:18-cv-01408-RJL Document1 Filed 06/14/18 Page 9 of 16

35. The parties agreed to the Terms of Reference, dated March 5, 2014, subject to the
ICC’s 2012 rules.

36. In addition to the claims asserted by CTC, the Arbitral Tribunal was presented
with certain counterclaims asserted by the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

37. At CTC’s request and after consultation with the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal
bifurcated the arbitration. The first phase would decide the merits of CTC’s claims and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo’s counterclaim. The first phase would also include a
determination of the amount owed on CTC’s invoices.

38. The Arbitral Tribunal reserved decision on the quantum of CTC’s claimed loss of
profits and loss of opportunity claims for the second phase. The Democratic Republic of the
Congo, given the choice, reserved decision of the quantum related to its counterclaim for the
second phase of the arbitration.

39. On April 7, 2014, CTC submitted its Claim Memorandum and supporting
documents.

40. On June 6, 2014, the Democratic Republic of the Congo submitted its Defense
Memorandum and supporting documents.

Al. On August 8, 2014, CTC submitted its Reply Memorandum and supporting
documents.

42. On October 8, 2014, the Democratic Republic of the Congo submitted its
Rejoinder and Final Memorandum and final documents.

43. On October 27, 2014, the Arbitral Tribunal heard testimony from the parties’

witnesses and argument at the ICC Hearing Center in Paris. At the request of the Democratic

Case 1:18-cv-01408-RJL Document1 Filed 06/14/18 Page 10 of 16

Republic of the Congo, one of its witnesses was permitted to testify by videoconference. Both
parties were permitted the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses.

44. The parties determined it was not necessary to submit post-hearing memoranda.

45. The parties submitted their Costs and Fees Memoranda on November 4 and
December 3, 2014.

46. The Arbitral Tribunal formally closed the proceedings on January 23, 2015.

The Award

47. On July 22, 2015, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered the Partial Award.

48. The Arbitral Tribunal denied the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s claim that
the Contract was void for non-compliance with the contractual provisions or statutes governing
public procurement contracts. Partial Award {J 107-18.

49. The Contract was not void as a matter of a public policy against corruption
because, as the Arbitral Tribunal specifically noted, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had
stated and confirmed that there was no corruption or attempted corruption giving rise to the
Contract. Id. [ 111, 113.

50. The Contract was not void under French law because the parties did not intend to
apply French public procurement rules to public procurement contracts in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo. Jd. J 114. Moreover, French law considers finding a contract to be void
to be an exceptional measure, requiring a weighing of the general interests involved. Jd. J 115. In
this case, however, the Arbitral Tribunal found, the highest authorities of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo approved the contract at issue in a transaction that was encouraged by

international financial institutions—a set of facts never before submitted to French courts and

Case 1:18-cv-01408-RJL Document1 Filed 06/14/18 Page 11 of 16

one which the French courts would find difficult to judge on the basis of the public interest in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. Jd.

51. The Contract was not void as violative of the Congolese Public Procurement Code
because the Democratic Republic of the Congo had failed to show that a competitive tender
process was required in this instance. /d. { 116. Congolese law permits contracts without such a
process where there are insufficient qualified competitors, and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo had failed to show that the Democratic Republic of the Congo would have attracted any
qualified tender other than CTC. Jd. { 117. Moreover, the Contract’s recitals included a
representation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo had decided to enter into the Contract
with CTC after consulting with various companies that specialize in the reform of customs and
tax departments. Jd. J 118.

52. The Arbitral Tribunal likewise denied the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s
arguments that the Contract was the result of fraud. Jd. {J 119-29. There was no fraud by non-
disclosure as the Democratic Republic of the Congo had at all times the information necessary to
it and had at its disposal experts from the WCO and IMF to counsel it regarding the Contract. Id.
{ 120. The Democratic Republic of the Congo further failed to prove any deceitful acts by CTC.
Id. J 121-27. Further, any right to avoidance premised on fraud would have been waived by the
Democratic Republic of the Congo’s repeated requests to CTC to postpone CTC’s decision to
terminate the Contract, which allowed the Democratic Republic of the Congo to continue
receiving the benefits of the Contract. Jd. { 129.

53. The Arbitral Tribunal likewise found that the Democratic Republic of the Congo
had failed to show any basis for reformation of the Contract. /d. 133-39. In response to the

Democratic Republic of the Congo’s allegation that the Contract was imbalanced because CTC’s

Case 1:18-cv-01408-RJL Document1 Filed 06/14/18 Page 12 of 16

services were minimal, the Arbitral Tribunal found that CTC had deployed up to 60 consultants
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and further noted that until CTC terminated the
Contract, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had never given notice to CTC of any asserted
breach. Id. J 137.

54. The Arbitral Tribunal next turned to the parties’ claims as to performance.

55. The Arbitral Tribunal found that the Democratic Republic of the Congo had
breached its payment obligations under the Contract. Jd. {| 150-58. The Arbitral Tribunal found
that prior to CTC’s termination of the Contract, the Democratic Republic of the Congo had never
disputed the unpaid invoices and that the Democratic Republic of the Congo did not dispute that
it had not paid the amounts claimed by CTC. Jd { 152.

56. The Arbitral Tribunal also found that the Democratic Republic of the Congo had
breached its obligation to ensure OFIDA’s cooperation with CTC. Jd. {J 159-63.

57. The Arbitral Tribunal found that the Democratic Republic of the Congo failed to
prove any of the breaches it alleged against CTC. /d. {J 164-78.

58. The Arbitral Tribunal then awarded damages to CTC for the unpaid invoices in

the following amounts:

a. Monthly fixed remunerations in the amount of $49,064,000;
b. Variable remunerations in the amount of $39,540,439; and
c. The balance of a certain mobilization indemnity in the amount of

$3,091,908.72.
For a total of $91,696,347, together with interest at the rate of 1.5% per month on each invoice as

from five days after its presentation until full payment. Jd. {| 239.

Case 1:18-cv-01408-RJL Document1 Filed 06/14/18 Page 13 of 16

59. The Arbitral Tribunal further awarded damages to CTC for demobilization
indemnity and repatriation allowance of its personnel in the amount of $3,750,000 with interest
at the rate of 1.5% per month from January 15, 2010 until full payment. Jd.

60. The Arbitral Tribunal also deferred decision regarding the costs of arbitration
until the Final Award. Id.

6l. On November 19, 2015, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered the Addendum, which
corrected a calculation error in the Partial Award by awarding to CTC the additional amount of
$853,751. Addendum, at Ruling Clause.

62. On November 27, 2015, CTC informed the Arbitral Tribunal that it waived
proceeding with the second phase of the arbitration and proposed a procedural calendar for the
determination of the allocation of the arbitration expenses.

63. On December 2, 2015, Democratic Republic of the Congo stated it had no
observations regarding the proposed procedural calendar.

64. After considering the briefing submitted by the parties, on February 22, 2016, the
Arbitral Tribunal rendered the Final Award. Final Award, {| 17-23, 48. The Final Award:

a. Allocated the responsibility for arbitral fees as between the parties,
ordering that the Democratic Republic of the Congo pay to CTC $162,500 in accordance
with that allocation;

b. Decided liability for legal fees, ordering the Democratic Republic of the
Congo to pay to CTC €200,000;

c. Awarded interest at the rate of 5% per year on both of these amounts from
the date of the Final Award until full payment; and

d. Dismissed all the parties’ other claims. Id. J 48.

CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
9 US.C. § 207

First Claim for Relief
(Confirmation of the Awards’ Monetary Relief)

65. Petitioner repeats and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in the
foregoing paragraphs and incorporates them herein by reference.

66. The United States is a contracting party to the New York Convention.

67. The New York Convention has been implemented in the United States by Chapter
Two of the Federal Arbitration Act.

68. The Partial Award, Addendum, and Final Award are governed by the New York

70. None of the grounds available for refusal or deferral of recognition and
enforcement of an award specified in the New York Convention apply to the Partial Award, the
Addendum, and the Final Award.

71. Therefore, the Partial Award, the Addendum, and the Final Award should be
confirmed pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207 and judgment in the United States should be entered for
the monetary relief awarded by the Tribunal.

Second Claim for Relief
(Prejudgment Interest on Amounts Due)

72. Petitioner repeats and re-alleges each and every allegation contained in in the

foregoing paragraphs and incorporates them herein by reference.

76. The Final Award includes interest at the rate of 5% per year on the arbitral fees of
$162,500 and the legal fees of €200,000 from the date of February 22, 2016 until full payment.
