FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS

 

THE REPUBLIC OF POLAND,
Petitioner, Civil Action No.

v.

VINCENT J. RYAN, SCHOONER CAPITAL LLC,
and ATLANTIC INVESTMENT PARTNERS LLC,

Respondents.

 

 

PETITION TO RECOGNIZE AND ENFORCE ARBITRATION AWARD

1. The Republic of Poland (“Poland”), by its undersigned attorneys, pursuant to
Section 207 of the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 207, and the Convention on the
Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958 (the “New York
Convention”), petitions this Court for an Order: (1) confirming, recognizing, and enforcing the
final award (the “Award”) rendered by an arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) on November 24, 2015,
in an arbitration (the “Arbitration”) commenced by Vincent J. Ryan (“Ryan”), Schooner Capital
LLC (“Schooner”), and Atlantic Investment Partners LLC (“Atlantic,” and, collectively with Ryan
and Schooner, “Award-debtors”) against Poland (collectively, with Award-debtors, the “Parties”’),
conducted pursuant to the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules of the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (the “ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules”);
(2) entering judgment in Poland’s favor against Award-debtors in the amounts of the Award plus
post-Award, pre-judgment interest accruing at a rate of 12% per annum; and (3) awarding Poland
such other and further relief as this Court may find just and proper. A copy of the Award is

attached as Exhibit 1 to the accompanying Declaration of Alexandre de Gramont (“de Gramont

Declaration”). A copy of the ICSID Additional Facility Arbitration Rules is attached as Exhibit 4
to the de Gramont Declaration.
PARTIES, JURISDICTION, AN! NUE

2. Poland brings this proceeding under Chapters 1 and 2 of the Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1 et seq., and the New York Convention.

3. Poland is a foreign state and was the respondent in the Arbitration.

4. Upon information and belief, Respondent Ryan is a citizen of the United States and
maintains a business address at 60 South Street, Suite 1120, Boston, MA 02111, and a residence
at 2 Avery St, Boston, MA 02111.

5. Upon information and belief, Respondent Schooner is a limited liability company
registered in Delaware and maintains a business address at 60 South Street, Suite 1120, Boston,
MA 02111.

6. Upon information and belief, Respondent Atlantic is or was a limited liability
company registered in Delaware with a business address at 60 South Street, Suite 1120, Boston,
MA 02111.

7. This Court has original jurisdiction over this action under 9 U.S.C. §§ 203 and 207
because this is a civil action seeking recognition and enforcement of an award rendered in an
arbitration falling under the New York Convention.

8. The Award was rendered in Paris, France, and is governed by the New York
Convention under 9 U.S.C. § 202 because it arises out of a commercial legal relationship that is

not entirely between citizens of the United States.

Case 1:18-cv-12382 Document1 Filed 11/14/18 Page 3 of 7

9. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 204, 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(1),
and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(3) because, inter alia, all Award-debtors reside and/or have their
principal place of business in Massachusetts.

THE AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE

10. The Parties’ agreement to arbitrate arises from a bilateral investment treaty between
the United States of America and Poland, namely, the Treaty Between the United States of
America and the Republic of Poland Concerning Business and Economic Relations (the “BIT”).
De Gramont Declaration, Exhibit 2. The BIT was signed on March 21, 1990, and entered into
force on August 6, 1994.

11. Article IX of the BIT contains a standing offer by Poland to arbitrate certain
investment disputes (as provided for under the terms of the BIT) with nationals of the United States
such as the Award-debtors.

12. The Award-debtors, as nationals of the United States, accepted Poland’s offer to
arbitrate disputes in a Declaration dated September 2, 2010. De Gramont Declaration, Exhibit 3;
Award, { 340.

THE ARBITRATION AND AWARD

13. In the Arbitration, Award-debtors alleged that Poland had breached its obligations
under the BIT with respect to investments that they had made in Poland. Award-debtors alleged,
inter alia, that certain matters of taxation and local proceedings undertaken in Poland had violated
Poland’s BIT obligations concerning expropriation and fair and equitable treatment. See Award,
{I 348-49, 497-501.

14. As stated above, Award-debtors commenced the Arbitration on March 31, 2011.

The Arbitration took place before a distinguished Tribunal consisting of Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan

Case 1:18-cv-12382 Document1 Filed 11/14/18 Page 4 of 7

(President), Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia (appointed by Award-debtors), and Professor
Claus von Wobeser (appointed by Poland). The Tribunal received multiple written submissions
from the Parties and held a hearing on jurisdiction and the merits in Paris from April 28, 2014, to
May 6, 2014. On November 24, 2015, the Tribunal dispatched a well-reasoned, 189-page Award
to the Parties, rejecting all of the claims asserted against Poland.

15. The Tribunal ordered Award-debtors, as the losing parties, to pay to Poland
USD 2,725,657.10 in costs. Award, J{[ 522, 527. At the same time, the Tribunal also awarded
Award-debtors USD 85,209.92 in respect of certain procedural applications on which they
prevailed against Poland in the Arbitration. Offsetting that sum against the Tribunal’s award in
Poland’s favor results in a total costs award for Poland in the amount of USD 2,640,447.18. See
Award, {{[ 523,527. The Award-debtors are jointly and severally liable to Poland for said amount,
plus interest.

16. Pursuant to Article IX of the BIT and Article 52(4) of the ICSID Additional Facility
Arbitration Rules, the Award is final and binding on the parties within the meaning of the New
York Convention and Chapters 1 and 2 of the FAA.

17. Poland has requested that Award-debtors pay the Award, but Award-debtors have
failed to do so.

18. The Award did not address the question of post-award interest. Poland is entitled
to post-award, pre-judgment interest because “federal law allows a district court to award post-
award, prejudgment interest in actions under the New York Convention.” Ministry of Def. &
Support for the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran v. Cubic Def. Sys., Inc., 665 F.3d
1091, 1103 (9th Cir. 2011); see also Indus. Risk Insurers v. M.A.N. Gutehoffnungshutte GmbH,

141 F.3d 1434, 1446-47 (11th Cir.1998); Waterside Ocean Navigation Co. v. Int’! Navigation

Case 1:18-cv-12382 Document1 Filed 11/14/18 Page 5 of 7

Ltd., 737 F.2d 150, 153-54 (2d Cir.1984). Further, an award of prejudgment interest “avoids
unjust enrichment.” TMTV, Corp. v. Mass Prods., Inc., 645 F.3d 464, 474 (1st Cir. 2011).

19. Poland is entitled to post-Award, pre-judgment interest calculated at the
Massachusetts interest rate of twelve percent per annum as provided by Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231,
§§ 6B, 6C, and 6H, on the Award amounts accruing from November 24, 2015, the date the payment
under the Award was due, through the date of this Court’s judgment. See In re Gianasmidis, 318
F. Supp. 3d 442, 454 (D. Mass. 2018) (“Under Massachusetts law, the 12% interest rate set forth
in Massachusetts General Laws chapter 231 [ . . . ] automatically attaches to arbitration awards --
even when the award is silent on the issue.”’).

LEGAL STANDARD

20. Section 207 of the FAA provides that a court “shall confirm” an award covered by
the New York Convention “unless it finds one of the grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition
or enforcement of the award specified in the [New York] Convention.” 9 U.S.C. § 207.

21. Accordingly, this Court must confirm the Award unless “it finds one of the grounds
for refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award” specified in the New York
Convention. Sesostris, S.A.E. v. Transportes Navales, S.A., 727 F. Supp. 737, 741 (D. Mass. 1989).
No such grounds exist in the instant case. There is a strong public policy in favor of international
arbitration, and review of arbitration awards should be quite limited “to avoid undermining the
twin goals of arbitration, namely, settling disputes efficiently and avoiding long and expensive
litigation.” Encyclopaedia Universalis S.A. v. Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc., 403 F.3d 85, 90 (2d
Cir.2005). The basis for the Award against the Award-debtors — that arbitral tribunals may assess

costs against the losing parties — is well accepted and uncontroversial in international arbitration.

Case 1:18-cv-12382 Document1 Filed 11/14/18 Page 6 of 7

22. For the foregoing reasons, Poland is entitled to an order confirming, recognizing,
and enforcing the Award pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207 and Article IV of the New York Convention.
REQUESTED RELIEF

23. Petitioner Poland therefore requests that this Court, pursuant to the Convention on
the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 9 U.S.C. § 201 ef seq., enter an
Order against Award-debtors:

1. Confirming the Award and granting judgment in favor of Poland and
against Award-debtors, jointly and severally, in the amount of USD 2,640,447.18.

2. Awarding Poland post-Award, pre-judgment interest, accruing at a rate of
twelve percent per annum under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, §§ 6B, 6C, and 6H, from
November 24, 2015, through the date of this Court’s Order, or in such other amount as the
Court deems just and proper.

3. Awarding Poland such other and further relief as the Court may deem to be

just and proper, including, as appropriate, the posting of security.
