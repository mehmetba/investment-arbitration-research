Witness Statement

THE PARTIES

A. THE CLAIMANT

The Claimant is Burlington Resources Inc. (“Burlington” or the “Claimant’), a
corporation created under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of
America, in 1988 and active in the exploitation of natural resources. On 31 March
2006, Burlington was acquired by ConocoPhillips, a multinational energy company
with headquarters in the State of Texas, United States of America.

The Claimant is represented in this phase of the proceedings by Mr. Nigel Blackaby,
Mr. Elliot Friedman, Mr. Carlos Ramos-Mrosovsky, Mr. Leon Skornicki, and Ms.
Bonnie Doyle of the law firm FRESHFIELDS BRUCKHAUS DERINGER US LLP; by
Mr. Craig Miles, Mr. Wade Coriell, Ms. Elizabeth M. Silbert, Ms. Jamie Miller, and
Ms. Kate E. Hill of the law firm KING & SPALDING LLP; by Mr. Jan Paulsson of the law
firm THREE CROWNS LLP; and by Mr. Javier Robalino of the law firm FERRERE
(Ecuabor).

B. THE RESPONDENT

The Respondent is the Republic of Ecuador (“Ecuador” or “Respondent”’).

The Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Dr. Diego Garcia Carrion,
Procurador General del Estado, Dra. Blanca Gomez de la Torre, Directora de
Asuntos Internacionales y Arbitraje, Dr. Christel Gaibor and Dr. Diana Moya from
the PROCURADURIA GENERAL DEL ESTADO, REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR; by Prof.
Eduardo Silva Romero, Mr. Philip Dunham, Mr. José Manuel Garcia Represa, Mr.
Alvaro Galindo, Ms. Erica Stein, Ms. Maria Claudia Procopiak, and Ms. Audrey
Caminades of the law firm DECHERT (Paris) LLP; and by Professor Pierre Mayer who
left DECHERT (Paris) LLP on 1 June 2015.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. DECISIONS ON JURISDICTION AND LIABILITY

On 2 June 2010, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, informing the
Parties that it would take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings
towards the merits phase.

On 14 December 2012, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Liability and informed
the Parties that it would take the necessary steps for the continuation of the
proceedings towards the quantum phase.

The Decisions on Jurisdiction and Liability are made an integral part of this Award.

B. DECISION ON COUNTERCLAIMS

In the course of this arbitration, on 17 January 2011, Ecuador raised counterclaims
seeking compensation for damage to the environment and to the infrastructure of
the oilfields allegedly caused by the Consortium. The Parties later entered into an
agreement conferring jurisdiction over the counterclaims to this Tribunal, as
recounted in Procedural Order No. 8 dated 21 July 2011 (Procedural Orders are
referred to herein as “PO” followed by their respective numbers).'

The proceedings on the counterclaims gave rise to a Decision on Counterclaims
issued shortly before this Award. The Decision on Counterclaims is made an integral
part of this Award.

Cc. WRITTEN PHASE ON QUANTUM

On 28 January 2013, Ecuador sought leave to submit (i) additional document
requests and (ii) a motion for reconsideration of the Decision on Liability. Ecuador
further requested the Tribunal to suspend the quantum proceedings or, in the
alternative, organize parallel proceedings, set out a briefing schedule and reserve a
2-3 day hearing on the motion for reconsideration. In its letters of 1 and 5 February
2013, Burlington responded that it did not object to additional document production
requests, nor did it contest the right of either Party to request reconsideration or
clarification, but it did object to the suspension of the quantum proceedings
requested by Respondent.

On 22 March 2013, the Tribunal set a document production schedule allowing the
Parties to make requests before the first round of quantum briefs. In PO11, the
Tribunal authorized Ecuador to file a motion for reconsideration, but denied the
suspension of the quantum proceedings or the holding of parallel proceedings.

On 30 April 2013, the Tribunal issued PO12 addressing Burlington’s quantum-
related document requests.

The POs not referred to here, for instance, POs No. 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21, 24, 30,
31, dealt with another aspect of these proceedings, for instance with the counterclaims.

10

20.

21.

On 24 June 2013, Burlington filed its Memorial on Quantum.

On 24 July 2013, Ecuador proposed the disqualification of Professor Orrego Vicufia,
following which the Centre informed the Parties on 25 July 2013 that the
proceedings were suspended pursuant to Rule 9(6) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure
for Arbitration Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”). On 13 December 2013, the Centre
issued its decision disqualifying Professor Orrego Vicufia. On 11 January 2014, the
Centre informed the Parties that the proceedings resumed upon Mr. Stephen
Drymer’s acceptance of his appointment as arbitrator in replacement of Professor
Orrego Vicufia.

On 31 January 2014, the Parties agreed to a revised calendar setting out the
procedural steps for the counterclaims as well as the quantum proceedings. On 10
February 2014, the Tribunal issued PO15 addressing Ecuador's quantum-related
document requests.

In PO18, issued on 22 April 2014, the Tribunal addressed Ecuador's renewed
request seeking a decision from the Tribunal ordering Burlington to comply with
PO15.

On 23 May 2014, Ecuador filed its Counter-Memorial on Quantum together with a
Motion for Reconsideration. In addition, Ecuador made a renewed attempt to
bifurcate its motion for reconsideration, to suspend the quantum proceedings, or
alternatively, to organize parallel proceedings allowing the Tribunal to rule on the
motion for reconsideration as a matter of urgency. On 7 July 2014, the Tribunal
issued PO22 denying Ecuador’s request to bifurcate the motion for reconsideration
from the proceedings on quantum.

On 9 August 2014, the Tribunal issued PO23, addressing Burlington’s request for
updated documents.

On 3 October 2014, Burlington filed its Reply on Quantum and Counter-Memorial on
Reconsideration.

In PO24 issued on 22 December 2014 the Tribunal ruled on Burlington’s request for
quantum-related documents and in PO25 issued on 23 December 2014, the
Tribunal resolved Ecuador's quantum-related document requests.

Thereafter, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder on Quantum and Motion for Reconsideration
on 12 January 2015.

22.

23.

24.

25.

26.

On 20 January 2015, the Tribunal and the Parties held a telephone conference to
discuss procedural aspects relating to the organization of the hearing on quantum
and Ecuador's motion for reconsideration.

On 29 January 2015, the Tribunal issued PO26 setting out the organizational
aspects of the upcoming hearing.

On 11 February 2015, the Tribunal issued PO27 deciding Burlington’s request to
introduce new evidence into the record, and on 18 February 2015, in PO28, the
Tribunal resolved Ecuador's request to introduce additional evidence.

On the same day, 18 February 2015, Burlington filed a supplemental witness
statement of Mr. Crick.

E. Post HEARING PHASE

On 29 May 2015, the Parties simultaneously filed their Post-Hearing Briefs (“PHBs”).

The Parties simultaneously filed their cost submissions on 2 May 2016, and their
reply submissions on 23 May 2016.

At the Tribunal’s request (as discussed and agreed with the Parties and their
experts prior to the close of the Hearing), in accordance with PO29 dated 13 March
2015, on 24 April 2015 the Parties’ experts submitted a joint valuation model
allowing for the calculation of potential damages according to the DCF methodology
under different assumptions and scenarios (the “Model”). The Tribunal understands
that, to the extent that each Party’s assumptions are applied as described in each
expert's individual report, the result of the joint model replaces the experts’ previous

damages figures. This is particularly relevant for valuations using the date of the
award or valuations of interest, which vary with time.

On 27 July 2016, the Tribunal invited the experts to update the Model, providing
additional assumptions and specifications (the “Updated Model”). The experts did so
on 20 September 2016 and the Parties commented on the Updated Model on 4

2016, and 29 November 2016, the Tribunal reported to the Parties on the progress
of its deliberations.

On 25 January 2017, the Tribunal declared the proceeding closed.

Ecuador submitted the following Request for Relief in its Counter-Memorial:®

“603. For the foregoing reasons, Ecuador respectfully requests that the Arbitral
Tribunal issue an award holding that Ecuador did not unlawfully expropriate
Burlington’s investment in Blocks 7 and 21 under Article III of the Treaty:

604. Should the Arbitral Tribunal nonetheless be inclined to rule in favor of
Burlington on its expropriation claim (contrary to the evidence presented by
Ecuador that no breach of the Treaty occurred), Ecuador respectfully requests
that no compensation be awarded to Burlington on account of its behavior leading
to its loss.

605. Should the Arbitral Tribunal nonetheless be inclined to award compensation
to Burlington, Ecuador respectfully requests that it be calculated in accordance

SCOPE OF THIS AWARD

This Award deals with and resolves Ecuador's motion to reconsider the Decision on
Liability, with the quantum of Burlington’s claims further to the Decision on Liability,
and with the costs of the entire arbitration, including the proceedings on Burlington's
claims (jurisdiction, liability and quantum phases) and Ecuador’s counterclaims. As
stated above, the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Decision on Liability and the Decision
on Counterclaims are also made integral parts of this Award.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS

A. Law APPLICABLE TO THE MERITS

The Tribunal refers to paragraphs 177 to 179 of the Decision on Liability. There, the
Tribunal reached the conclusion that it would apply (i) first and foremost the BIT and,
if need be, (ii) Ecuadorian law and those rules of international law “as may be
applicable”. In this latter respect, the Tribunal further stated that it was of the view
that the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate
matters to either law. It is thus for the arbitrators to determine whether an issue is
subject to national or international law, it being understood that a party may not rely
on its internal law to avoid an obligation under international law.

B. UNDISPUTED MATTERS

When applying the law (whether national or international), be it in this Award or in
earlier decisions, the Tribunal is of the view that it is not bound by the arguments
and sources invoked by the Parties. The principle iura novit curia — or better in this
instance, iura novit arbiter — allows the Tribunal to form its own opinion of the
meaning of the law, provided that it does not rely on a legal theory that was not
subject to debate or that the Parties could not anticipate or address.®

See, for instance: Daimler Financial Services A.G. v. Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No.
ARB/05/1 (“Daimler v. Argentina’), Decision on Annulment of 7 January 2015, § 295 (“[...] an
arbitral tribunal is not limited to referring to: or relying upon only the authorities cited by the
parties. It can, sua sponte, rely on other publicly available authorities, even if they have not
been cited by the parties, provided that the issue has been raised before the tribunal and the
parties were provided an opportunity to address it”). See also: Fisheries Jurisdiction Case

c. RELEVANCE OF DECISIONS OF OTHER INTERNATIONAL COURTS AND TRIBUNALS

As stated in the Decisions on Jurisdiction and Liability, the Tribunal considers that it
is not bound by previous decisions of international tribunals. The majority
considers, however, that, subject always to the specifics of a given treaty and to the
circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to adopt solutions established in a
series of consistent similar cases, if such exist, absent compelling contrary grounds.
Arbitrator Stern does not analyze the arbitrator’s role in the same manner, as she
considers it her duty to decide each case purely on its own merits as argued before
her, independently of any apparent jurisprudential trend.

D. LANGUAGE OF DECISIONS AND AWARD

In accordance with Clause 7 of the Minutes of First Session, the Tribunal renders
this Award, and has rendered its prior decisions, in both English and Spanish. This
being so, it notes that English is the language in which this Award and the prior
decisions were originally drafted. Hence, in the event of any discrepancy between
the two versions, the English version must be deemed to reflect the meaning
intended by the Tribunal, and such version shall thus prevail.

ECUADOR’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION

In its Motion for Reconsideration (the “Motion”), Ecuador requests that the Tribunal
reconsider its Decision on Liability on the ground of two exceptional circumstances.
A. PARTIES’ POSITIONS

1. Ecuador’s position

Ecuador requests that the Decision on Liability be reconsidered because it is
“fundamentally and fatally flawed” with respect to the question whether there was an

 

1974, 18 (‘i]t being the duty of the Court itself to ascertain and apply the relevant law in
the given circumstances of the case, the burden of establishing or proving rules of
international law cannot be imposed upon any of the Parties, for the law lies within the
judicial knowledge of the Court”); Albert Jan Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The

expropriation.'° Ecuador raises essentially two “exceptional circumstances”, which,
it says, justify reconsideration “even though a finding for Ecuador on either count will
suffice to reverse the unlawful expropriation holding”:'"'

(i) _ the Tribunal based its decision on expropriation on a legal
argument over Article 74(4) of the Hydrocarbons Law (the
“HL”) that neither Party had raised;'? and/or

(ii) the Tribunal reached its decision without the full

knowledge of the significant, real and immediate risks

created by the suspension, Burlington having withheld key

evidence in this regard."
According to Ecuador, the Decision on Liability is not an award, but a “decision
preliminary to an award” which does not carry res judicata effects, '4 as was recently
confirmed by the tribunal in Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB’) v. Tanesco."® It is
therefore capable of reconsideration in the Tribunal’s discretion. Here, the Tribunal
should exercise its discretion to reconsider as a result of the exceptional
circumstances just referred to. ®

Ecuador further argues that the Motion is admissible and that the Tribunal has the
power to reconsider the Decision on Liability.'” In particular, it notes that Burlington
expressly agreed that both Parties could seek reconsideration and thus cannot now
object that the Motion is inadmissible.'® It further explains that “powers of
reconsideration” exist in exceptional circumstances, such as those embodied in
Articles 49(2), 51, 52 of the ICSID Convention, as well as ICSID Arbitration Rules 25

and 38(2).'9 In any event, Ecuador submits that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention
provides the Tribunal with the inherent power to reconsider prior decisions.

According to Ecuador, SCB v. Tanesco confirms that the Tribunal has the power to
reopen and amend the Decision on Liability.?° Ecuador admits that such power is
limited to exceptional circumstances,”' but it argues that it is not constrained by the
requirements of Article 51 or Article 52 applied by analogy or by any other provision
of the ICSID Convention.” If, par impossible, the Tribunal were to hold that the
Decision on Liability is res judicata, it could still reconsider the decision, under the
higher standard of Article 51.° In contrast to the Perenco tribunal, which merely
examined whether any of the provisions invoked by Ecuador applied to the motion
for reconsideration in that case, the Tribunal should focus on the existence of
exceptional circumstances justifying reconsideration.24 According to the
Respondent, exceptional circumstances exist if “any of the grounds for reopening a
Convention award or decision apply, or if it is otherwise in the interest of justice”.

Turning to the merits of the Motion, Ecuador asserts that its intervention in Blocks 7
and 21 did not constitute an unlawful expropriation.2° For Ecuador, the conditions
under which it could intervene in the Blocks were met and the significant risks of
damage posed by the suspension justified its immediate intervention. Ecuador also
stresses that the tribunal in SCB v. Tanesco reconsidered its prior decision in
circumstances similar to the present ones.?”

First, Ecuador submits that the Tribunal should reconsider its decision on
expropriation and hold that Ecuador was entitled to intervene in the Blocks “following
the Consortium’s suspension”.”® It essentially invokes five reasons in support of this

submission: (i) the Tribunal, in breach of due process, reached its decision by
engaging in an interpretation of Article 74 HL “that neither party had raised in these
proceedings”;® (ii) Article 74(4) HL only relates to caducidad, not to suspension or
intervention;*' (iii) Ecuador was entitled to intervene in the Blocks to ensure the
continuity of hydrocarbon production as required under its Constitution, Ecuadorian
law, and the PSCs;* (iv) intervention is not a sanction, but a coercive measure
aimed at protecting Ecuador's strategic assets in a situation of urgency, and
Ecuador had inherent powers to substitute itself to a private oilfield contractor in
default;3° and (v) provisions of Ecuadorian law provide for inherent powers of the
State to fulfill its duty to minimize “all negative impact on the hydrocarbon
production”.**

In addition, Ecuador requests that the Tribunal reconsider its decision not to assess
arguments based on the exceptio non adimpleti contractus. Instead, it should hold
that the Consortium could not rely on that defense, since (i) Burlington admitted that
“the only reason” why the Tribunal found just cause to suspend operations was that
Ecuador had breached its contractual commitments, which is precisely an
application of the exceptio;°° (ii) the exceptio is inapplicable in the circumstances of
the present case, as hydrocarbon operations are subject to the principle of
continuity;%* (iii) there are no Ecuadorian cases allowing a contractor to raise the
exceptio against the State;°” and (iv) Burlington should have sought the Tribunal’s
authorization to suspend operations.**

Second, Ecuador argues that the suspension of the oilfield operations created risks
of damage so significant as to justify immediate intervention. According to Ecuador,
the technical action plan of 3 June 2009 to suspend operations at Blocks 7 and 21

(in Ecuador's abbreviation, the “Suspension Plan” or, in Burlington’s terminology, the
“Draft Action Plan’) which Burlington disclosed belatedly and the Tribunal thus did
not have knowledge of when making the Decision on Liability is “highly relevant
evidence”.*° It demonstrates the existence of significant risks of reservoir,“
mechanical*! and environmental damage.“ It also shows that the Consortium was
aware of these risks. The Decision on Liability was therefore premised on
incomplete and misleading evidence.** Contrary to Burlington’s view, that document
is not privileged since it addresses the technical risks of suspension.“

In response to the Tribunal’s questions on the relevance of Article 51 of the ICSID
Convention, Ecuador submits that the Suspension Plan constitutes a fact proving
that the suspension entailed “serious risks” of which the Consortium was aware.“>
While Article 51 only applies to awards, the rule enshrined in that provision should
apply to pre-award decisions as well. Accordingly, revision should be available when
a fact is discovered which decisively affects a pre-award decision.‘® Ecuador also
argues that, since Burlington produced the Suspension Plan belatedly, the time
limits set forth in Article 51 do not apply.

In addition, so says the Respondent, the Suspension Plan proves that the
Consortium imprudently planned to abandon the Blocks, as it failed to engage in an
in-depth risk assessment.’” In short, the Suspension Plan identified ‘real and
significant risks” associated with the suspension, in particular reservoir, mechanical

and environmental risks. These risks justified Ecuador's immediate intervention*® to
avoid significant damage and economic loss.*°

2.  Burlington’s position

Burlington argues that the Motion is inadmissible as a matter of law, as the ICSID
system does not provide for such a review mechanism. In any event, Burlington
alleges that the Draft Action Plan does not affect the Tribunal’s finding of unlawful
expropriation.

In the first place, Burlington submits that the ICSID Convention “firmly forecloses”
interlocutory reconsiderations such as the one sought by Ecuador. The ICSID
Convention provides that review can only occur after a final award and is “extremely
circumscribed”.®° The Tribunal has no power to invent remedies not present in the
ICSID framework.*' In addition, the Tribunal’s implied or inherent powers are only
“gap-filling powers”; they cannot operate in a manner “contrary to the positive
architecture of the ICSID Convention and Rules”.°? The kind of “open-ended
reconsideration” requested by Ecuador would lead to “procedural paralysis”, in
particular in bifurcated or trifurcated cases.*°

More specifically, Burlington states that (i) the ICSID system allows no
reconsideration of final decisions;® (ii) the Decision on Liability is final according to
the principle of res judicata;>> and (iii) the Tribunal has no inherent powers under
Article 44 of the ICSID Convention or otherwise to entertain the Motion.®° For
Burlington, the Decision on Liability is not a draft. Even though it is not a final award,
it is final as to liability “just as the Decision on Jurisdiction was to jurisdiction”.°” The
finality and res judicata nature of pre-award decisions was confirmed in

ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela and Perenco v. Ecuador, as well as in other cases.
In addition, Burlington highlights that Ecuador acknowledged the finality of pre-
award decisions disposing of issues in this case when it objected to the purported
reintroduction of claims that had been discarded at the jurisdictional stage.

For Burlington, SCB v. Tanesco cannot be understood as an “endorsement of free-
for-all reconsideration”.*' That decision confirms that ICSID tribunals only assume a
power to reconsider final decisions “in circumstances of the most extreme injustice”,
such as perpetrating fraud upon the tribunal.® Unlike the present dispute, so says
Burlington, SCB v. Tanesco presented an “extreme set of facts”, where the tribunal
was deliberately misled on a material fact, which required the tribunal to fashion a
“correspondingly extreme — and unprecedented — remedy”.® In doing so, the
tribunal stressed that the power to reconsider is not unlimited, since an
unconstrained power would lead to considerable uncertainty. It therefore set an
“extremely high threshold” for reconsideration, which is not met here.

In response to the Tribunal’s questions on the pertinence of Article 51 of the ICSID
Convention, Burlington submits that (i) revision is not allowed if the relevant fact was
known prior to the issuance of an award;® (ii) Ecuador has not alleged a fact that
could support the application of Article 51 by analogy;® and (iii) Ecuador failed to

act timely as it was in possession of the Draft Action Plan for 135 days before it filed
it.°” While Ecuador now argues that that document is “decisive”, it “did not think so
at the time”. Regardless of Ecuador's motives, Burlington insists that ‘if a party
seeking to reopen a past decision was, or should have been aware before the
decision was issued of the facts upon which reconsideration is sought, such a
request must be denied”.

On the merits, Burlington is of the view that the Motion must fail both on the law and
the facts. On the law, and more specifically as regards the complaint that the
Tribunals interpretation of Article 74 HL breached due process, the Motion is a
“direct appeal” of a legal determination, which is “categorically foreclosed” under the
ICSID system.” As confirmed in SCB v. Tanesco, the power of reconsideration, if it
exists, cannot encompass the situation where “an unsuccessful party simply wants
to re-argue an issue”.”' In any event, the Tribunal’s decision was “entirely correct”,
since (i) Ecuador’s conduct was “expressly prohibited’ under Ecuadorian law and
therefore breached the principle of legality;”* (ii) no inherent power otherwise
authorized Ecuador to intervene in the Blocks;”° and (iii) the Tribunal’s inquiry under
Article 74 HL obviated the need to assess the applicability of the exceptio non
adimpleti contractus.”

On the facts, Burlington argues that the Draft Action Plan is irrelevant to the
Decision on Liability.”° On the one hand, the plan is privileged and protected by the
work product doctrine.”° It was thus properly withheld until Perenco produced it on
1 August 2012.’” On the other hand, the Draft Action Plan “would not have, and
cannot now cause, the Tribunal to alter the findings in the Decision on Liability’.”*
Thus, unlike in SCB v. Tanesco, the Draft Action Plan “was neither ‘material’ nor

could it have had ‘an impact’ on the Tribunal’s decision on liability”.”® The Plan was
only the starting point for discussions within the Consortium and was not intended to
reflect Burlington’s or the Consortium’s views on the risks of the planned
suspension.® It remained a draft enumerating a number of issues. That draft was
superseded by conversations held in Bogota on 18-19 June 2009;%' by Ecuador's
suspension plan review of 30 June 2009;* by the decision of the Consortium’s
representatives entitled “Consent Action of the Representatives” of 8 July 2009
authorizing suspension;® and by the organigram of the Consortium’s post-
suspension team.* The draft status of the plan is demonstrated by the fact that
various proposals which it contains, such as terminating work contracts, were not
retained.® As Mr. d’Argentré testified, “we moved on to a new plan”.®

In the circumstances, Burlington contends that “Ecuador cannot now argue that
these claimed risks were unknown to it, or that they emerged only with the
production of the Draft Action Plan, when Ecuador in fact claimed (incorrectly) that
the risks of suspending operations justified its actions, and submitted extensive
briefing and expert evidence on the issue before the Decision on Liability’.®” In fact,
so Burlington, RPS stated that the Draft Action Plan “confirmed” its “prior
conclusions”, thus showing that it “added nothing of substance”.®°

Regarding the risks alleged by Ecuador, Burlington claims that the suspension
would not have increased the risk of reservoir, mechanical or environmental
damage. It stresses that “controlled suspension of operations is routine and does
not create significant risk of harm”.® It further highlights that the Consortium

suspended operations for a week in all of Block 7 in 2005, as well as in all of Block
21 and parts of Block 7 in 2006, without any material harm to the oilfields.°°

With respect to reservoir damage more specifically, Dr. Strickland testified that the
alleged risks of cross-flow and water encroachment were immaterial and would in
any event have stabilized within a matter of hours.°' The shut-ins in 2005 and 2006
showed that no such risks existed.9?

In connection with environmental damage, Burlington argues that the risks of
sabotage and looting during the suspension were already addressed in the Decision
of Liability, where the Tribunal recognized the Consortium’s intention to keep
personnel on the ground to supervise the fields.°° To Ecuador's argument that
naturally flowing wells could contaminate the surrounding environment, Burlington
responds that the pressure of these wells is 400 psi and that any naturally flowing
crude would have been contained by wellheads resisting 5000 psi.°* As RPS
admits, leaks may occur “whether operations are suspended or not”, which
discredits the claim that the suspension increases environmental risks of naturally-
flowing wells. Various wells had previously been shut-in without environmental
damage resulting from naturally flowing wells.°°

Finally, in respect of mechanical damage, Dr. Egan’s testimony showed that the
suspension would have reduced the strain on electric submersible pumps (ESPs).%
Further, the allegation of risk of pipeline rupture has been proven wrong since the
Consortium, as an experienced professional field operator, knew perfectly well how
to gradually ramp-up production upon restarting the operations without breaking the
pipeline.°”

For these reasons, Burlington requests the Tribunal to declare the Motion
inadmissible, or, in the alternative, to dismiss it as unfounded.°*

B. Discussion
1. Applicable legal framework

Ecuador invokes Articles 49(2), 51, 52 of the ICSID Convention, as well as Rules 25
and 38(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules in support of the Motion.°° Ecuador also
relies on Article 44 of the ICSID Convention to argue that the Tribunal has inherent
powers to entertain the Motion. For its part, Burlington relies on Article 53 of the
Convention to argue that the Motion is inadmissible.

Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which deals with the procedural powers of ICSID
tribunals, reads as follows:

“Any arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the
provisions of this Section and, except as the parties otherwise agree,
in accordance with the Arbitration Rules in effect on the date on which
the parties consented to arbitration. If any question of procedure
arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or
any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the
question”.

Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention concerning the rectification of awards, is
worded as follows:

“The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after
the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the
other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the
award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the
award. [...]’.

Article 51 of the ICSID Convention, which is the provision on revision of awards, has
the following relevant wording:

“(1) Either party may request revision of the award by an application
in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on the ground of
discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the
award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was
unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant and that the applicant's
ignorance of that fact was not due to negligence.

Id., 4.240.

Ecuador also invoked various other provisions, such as Articles 14 and 48 of the ICSID
Convention, as well as Rule 12 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which the Tribunal does not
deem necessary to spell out in more detail at this juncture.

Article 52 of the ICSID Convention about the annulment of awards, reads in

more of the following grounds:

Ll
(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;
Ll

(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule
of procedure; or

(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based

Lal’.

Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, which provides for the finality of ICSID
is worded as follows:

“(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject
to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this
Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of
the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been
stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.

(2) For the purposes of this Section, “award” shall include any
decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to
Articles 50, 51 or 52”.

Arbitration Rule 25 entitled “Correction of Errors”, has the following content:

“An accidental error in any instrument or supporting document may,
with the consent of the other party or by leave of the Tribunal, be
corrected at any time before the award is rendered”.

follows:

“(1) When the presentation of the case by the parties is completed,

2. Analysis

The Tribunal will address its power to reconsider the Decision on Liability (2.1), and
then review the two legs of the Motion, namely the contention that the Tribunal erred
as a matter of law (2.2) and that it was misled by Burlington and reached its decision
on the basis of incomplete facts (2.3).

2.1 Power to reconsider the Decision on Liability

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that, contrary to Ecuador's contention, Burlington
has not accepted the admissibility of the Motion. Indeed, Burlington merely accepted
that Ecuador raise the Motion in parallel to the quantum proceedings. Specifically,
Burlington stated that it had “no objection to either party raising any requests for
reconsideration or clarification in the context of its pleadings in the quantum
phase”.'°° The lack of objection went to the procedural setting of the request for
reconsideration, not to admissibility.

Neither the ICSID Convention nor the Arbitration Rules contain provisions dealing
with the power of tribunals to reconsider their decisions.'°' Unlike most national
arbitration laws and the New York Convention, the ICSID legal framework
distinguishes between “decisions” and “awards”. The term “award” is reserved for
the decision putting an end to the arbitration, which under other regimes is called a
final award. So for instance, a decision denying jurisdiction over the entire dispute
(Arbitration Rule 41(6)) or a decision on the merits that resolves all or all the
remaining claims before the tribunal is an “award” (Article 48(3) ICSID Convention).
On the other hand, a preliminary decision affirming jurisdiction or resolving other
issues arising “on the road” to the final award, e.g. on applicable law, or liability, or
part of the claims, is a (pre-award) “decision” for ICSID purposes. Under other
regimes, these decisions would be designated by terms such as interim, preliminary,
interlocutory, or partial awards.

Pre-award decisions must also be distinguished from procedural orders that
organize the proceedings and from provisional measures. Due to their nature, such

Letter of 1 February 2013 from Burlington to the Tribunal, p. 1.

Except for Article 39(3) of the Arbitration Rules, which provides that the tribunal “may at any
time modify or revoke its recommendations” on provisional measures.

32

84.

85.

86.

procedural orders and orders for provisional remedies can be reconsidered at any
time, if circumstances so require.’ In effect, Arbitration Rule 39(3) expressly
authorizes a tribunal to reopen a decision on provisional measures.' This is the
only provision in the ICSID legal framework expressly empowering a tribunal to
reconsider a decision which it has rendered.

These distinctions being made, one notes that the ICSID framework is silent about
the possibility of reopening a pre-award decision.

The majority in ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela held that decisions preliminary to an
award “that resolve points in dispute between the Parties” are vested with res
judicata and can thus not be reopened.'™ A similar view was adopted in Perenco v.
Ecuador,’® although the tribunal envisaged the possibility that “a very specific
situation” may call for a tribunal to “revisit its prior findings”.'°° By contrast, the
tribunal in SCB v. Tanesco recently held that pre-award decisions are not res
judicata, and that “there may be circumstances where a tribunal should consider
reopening a decision that it has made”.'°’ This view had previously been expressed
in the dissenting opinion of Professor Abi-Saab'® in the Conoco case just referred

to.1

The Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in SCB v. Tanesco when it states that a pre-
award decision does not carry res judicata effects, for reasons essentially connected
to the structure or architecture of the ICSID Convention. First, apart from orders on

occasion of the second Conoco reconsideration decision (ConocoPhillips et al. v. Venezuela,

procedural matters under Article 44 and under other rules dealing with the
organization of the proceedings and other than decisions on provisional measures,
the ICSID framework contemplates that arbitration proceedings give rise only to (i)
one decision on preliminary objections, if such objections are raised and are not
joined to the merits (Arbitration Rule 41(4)), and to (ii) one (final) award (Article 48
ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules 46 ff.).''° It provides further that the award
must deal with “every question submitted to the Tribunal” (Article 48(3)) and contain
the “decision of the Tribunal on every question submitted to it” (Arbitration Rule
47(1)(i)). To comply with these provisions, the practice is for tribunals to incorporate
earlier decisions into their (final) award.

Second, remedies, i.e. rectification, requests for supplementary decisions,
interpretation, revision, and annulment, are only available from the time when the
award is rendered. In other words, a decision affirming jurisdiction, for instance, can
only be challenged in annulment proceedings brought once the (final) award in
which it is incorporated is issued.

Third, following the same logic, the duty of ICSID Contracting States to recognize
decisions emanating from the Centre and to enforce pecuniary obligations imposed
by such decisions under Article 54(1) of the Convention only applies to awards, not
to earlier decisions even though these could include pecuniary obligations, for
instance a cost order contained in a decision accepting jurisdiction.

In the Tribunal’s view, the requirement for incorporation of earlier decisions into the
award, the absence of remedies against these decisions, and the fact that the
Contracting States’ obligation to recognize and enforce only attaches to the award,
not to earlier decisions, show that res judicata attaches to the “award” in the ICSID
meaning and not to earlier decisions.

This being so, the lack of res judicata does not mean that decisions on preliminary
objections and what under other rules would be called interim or preliminary awards
on issues other than jurisdiction and admissibility can necessarily be reopened.
Indeed, ICSID tribunals have had no hesitation finding that preliminary decisions
bind the parties and the tribunal in the course of the proceedings. That view is

This restrictive position was, for instance, adopted in Tanesco v. Independent Power
Tanzania: “[T]he ICSID Arbitration Rules contain no provisions which permit or even
contemplate ‘Partial’ or ‘Interim’ Awards, indeed, it seemed to the Tribunal that the Rules
contemplated only one, Final Award”. Tanzania Electric Supply Company Ltd. v.
Independent Power Tanzania Ltd., ICSID Case No. ARB/98/7 (“Tanesco v. Independent
Power Tanzania’), Final Award of 22 June 2001, § 32 (Exh. TL-001).

34

92.

114

sometimes put in terms of res judicata (quod non, as was concluded above).'"' It is
also occasionally expressed as a manifestation of the intentions of the tribunal, as
for example in Electrabel v. Hungary:

“Although necessarily described as a ‘Decision’ and not an ‘Award’

under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules, the several

decisions and reasons contained in this Decision are intended by the

Tribunal to be final and not to be revisited by the Parties or the

Tribunal in any later phase of these arbitration proceedings”. "2
In the words of the second Amco Asia tribunal, the approach is stated as a general
principle “that a right, question, or fact distinctly put in issue and distinctly
determined cannot be disputed”.''? Whatever the justification, these tribunals
express the opinion that an issue resolved once in the course of an arbitration
should in principle not be revisited in the same proceedings. Irrespective of res
judicata, the rationale for this opinion is obvious: a contrary view would defeat the
purpose of efficient dispute settlement, entailing constant re-litigation of issues
already resolved, with unavoidable adverse consequences in terms of increased
costs and length of proceedings. In addition, the possibility of re-litigating issues
would jeopardize legal certainty and ultimately undermine the confidence of the
users in the system.

Having reached the conclusion that ICSID tribunal decisions (other than orders on
procedure and provisional measures) which are not final awards are not res
judicatae, but are nevertheless binding on the parties and the tribunal within the
proceedings in which they were issued, the Tribunal also agrees with the finding in
SCB v. Tanesco according to which “there may be circumstances where a tribunal
should consider reopening a decision that it has made”.

Waste Management v. Mexico II, Decision on Mexico’s Preliminary Objection concerning the
Previous Proceedings of 26 June 2002, ¥ 45 (Exh. EL-141) (“[A]t whatever stage of the case
it is decided, a decision on a particular point constitutes a res judicata as between the parties
to that decision if it is a necessary part of the eventual determination and is dealt with as
such by the tribunal”).

be noted that in connection with the merits the Respondent has again raised certain

jus standi of the Claimant. These issues were decided upon at that stage and will not be
reopened in this Award”).

The SCB tribunal saw practical advantages in accepting such a power of
reconsideration, be it based on Article 51(1) or 44 of the ICSID Convention: “It
avoids having the Tribunal decide issues on the merits on the basis of a decision
which has been seriously called into question, and then have the parties wait until
the whole matter has been included in its final award before having its decision
reopened or subject to annulment, thus potentially wasting the time and expense
that has been incurred since the Tribunal became aware that its decision could be
called into question. Efficiency grounds alone suggest that there may be
circumstances where a tribunal should consider reopening a decision that it has
made”."*® In other words, procedural efficiency, which requires that an interim
decision be binding on the tribunal that has issued such a decision, may at the same
time call for an exception to the principle of binding force under certain
circumstances. The Tribunal agrees with this view.

The question thus is to determine what exceptional circumstances may warrant
reopening a decision that binds an ICSID tribunal. In answering this question, the
Tribunal is in agreement with the SCB decision, pursuant to which it “should be
guided by, although not bound by, the limitations that apply to awards”, adding that
the power to reconsider extends “at least [...] to the grounds for reopening an award
in Article 51”.'® The limitations applicable to awards include the prohibition of
appeals in Article 53(1), the restrictive bases for revision in Article 51, and possibly
the limited grounds for annulment in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, to which the
Tribunal will revert.

Ecuador refers to a number of provisions, quoted above, to substantiate its
argument that exceptional circumstances may justify reconsidering decisions
preliminary to an award. While Ecuador concedes that none of these provisions
specifically apply to pre-award decisions, it argues that “exceptional circumstances”
warrant reopening a pre-award decision in all cases where it can be shown “that any
of the grounds for reopening a Convention award or decision apply”,'"” or if it is
“otherwise in the interest of justice”.‘"® Ecuador further submits that the standard of
review to reconsider the Decision on Liability “must necessarily be lower under pre-

97.

98.

closing circumstances than the standard of review at the post-award annulment
stage (or even in post-closing circumstances)”.'1°

The Tribunal cannot follow Ecuador's far-reaching interpretation of a tribunal's
power to reconsider pre-award decisions or the proposed standard of review. The
tribunal in SCB v. Tanesco rightly held that an unconstrained power of
reconsideration would lead to “considerable uncertainty”.'° In the present case, the
Decision on Liability is binding on the Tribunal and the Parties; it is not a draft that
can be reopened at will.

As was mentioned earlier, guidance must be sought by analogy in the limitations
applicable to the reconsideration of awards. In this respect, Article 51(1) allows a
party to request the revision of an award “on the ground of discovery of some fact of
such a nature as decisively to affect the award”, provided that “when the award was
rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and the applicant and that the
applicant's ignorance of the fact was not due to negligence”. Article 51(2) requires
that the application be made within 90 days after the discovery of such fact and no
more than 3 years after the award was rendered. Venezuela Holdings summarized
the requirements of knowledge and timing contained in the first paragraph of Article
51 as follows:

“Only a fact that existed when the award was rendered could have

been known when the award was rendered. Only ignorance of a fact

that existed when the award was rendered could be due to

negligence. It follows that only a fact that existed when the award was

rendered may form the basis for a request for revision under Article

51(1) of the ICSID Convention”. 12"
The Tribunal is of the view that this provision, although worded as a post-award
remedy, may apply by analogy to pre-award decisions. This view relies in particular
on Article 51(3), which favors a solution where, to the extent possible, the tribunal
that rendered the award is reconstituted to deal with a revision request. Where the
arbitration is still pending and the tribunal still constituted, it appears all the more
compelling that the tribunal be afforded the opportunity to revise a pre-award
decision if a decisive and previously unknown fact comes to light.

102.

This view is further confirmed when one observes that it is generally accepted in
proceedings before both international tribunals and national courts that an
adjudicatory body can reopen a judgment or award that it has rendered in revision
proceedings.

The International Court of Justice ruled that it cannot be excluded that the same
tribunal revise a judgment “in special circumstances when new facts of decisive
importance have been discovered”, a process which cannot be likened to an appeal
and which would “conform with rules generally provided in statutes or laws issued
for courts of justice”.'?? Mixed claims commissions as well as the Iran-US Claims
Tribunal, have also accepted the existence of a power to revise their prior decisions
or awards under exceptional circumstances, such as the appearance of decisive
new evidence, even in the absence of an express power under the applicable
rules. The lran-US Claims Tribunal circumscribed exceptional circumstances
justifying the revision of an award to situations where the challenged decision was
induced by fraud or perjury and to cases of “discovery of some fact of such a nature
as to be a decisive factor’,'*4 provided that the ignorance of the new fact was not
due to the applicant's negligence and that it was raised in a timely manner.'2

An additional reason for accepting to apply Article 51 by analogy is the timing that it
envisages. Ecuador argues that, unless a remedy analogous to that of Article 51
were available, a party would be deprived of an opportunity to seek revision when
the relevant fact became known to the applicant and the Tribunal after the
preliminary decision but before the award. '7°

At the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties whether the absence of an
analogous remedy may not encourage a party that discovers a decisive fact to

conceal that discovery until after the award is rendered.'2” The Parties did not
dispute that Article 51 may find application by analogy, although Ecuador argued
that the conditions set out in Article 51 should not apply as such to pre-award
requests for revision, while Burlington submitted that Ecuador’s request did not fulfill
the conditions set in that provision.

More specifically, in respect of the time limit set in Article 51(2), Ecuador states that
it “does not apply”, since it was only stipulated to avoid indefinite revisions after the
issuance of an award. As the arbitration here is still pending, the time limit is “devoid
of any rationale”, says Ecuador. This position appears to be supported by SCB v.
Tanesco, where the tribunal decided that the constraints of the requirements of
Article 51 need not apply if pre-award decisions are not considered to be res
judicata.

In the Tribunal’s view, the discovery of outcome-determinative facts unknown to the
Tribunal and the applicant prior to the rendering of a pre-award decision should
open the possibility of revising such decision prior to the issuance of the award in
application of Article 51 by analogy. This exception to the binding nature of a
preliminary decision must, however, be balanced against the interests of legal
certainty and procedural efficiency. These interests militate in favor of keeping the
requirements set out in Article 51(1), as well as the time limit of 90 days from the
discovery of the decisive fact set out in Article 51(2). While the time limits for the
revision of an award (90 days after discovery and in any event no later than three
years after the award) are meant to avoid that an award vested with res judicata
may be put into question indefinitely, a consideration that does not apply here, there
are nonetheless good reasons to stick to the 90 day time period even when the
proceedings are still pending. Indeed, the sooner the discovery is brought to the
attention of the tribunal, the lesser the potential consequences on the proceedings,
as this case well shows. Moreover, the existence of a time limit encourages “good
behavior” and discourages “bad behavior”, such as concealing the fact until such
time as a party considers it strategic or tactical to disclose it. Such a limitation
cannot be said to unduly restrict the applicant’s rights, as parties and counsel seem
in a better position to promptly assess and act on the discovery of a new fact while
they are still actively involved in pursuing their case than after the end of the
proceedings.

Procedural Order No. 29, § 4(a).

39

105.

106.

107.

108.

In summary, the Tribunal considers that a pre-award decision (other than a
procedural order or decision on provisional measures) may be revised under Article
51 applied by analogy, provided (i) a fact is discovered; (ii) of such a nature as
decisively to affect the pre-award decision; (iii) which was unknown to the Tribunal
and to the applicant when the pre-award decision was rendered; (iv) the applicant's
ignorance not being due to negligence; and (v) the request for reconsideration being
made within 90 days after the discovery of the fact.

Turning now to the other provisions that Ecuador invokes to support the Motion, the
Tribunal considers that the Respondent's reliance on Article 49(2) of the Convention
and Article 25 of the Rules is to no avail, since Ecuador does not allege that the
Tribunal omitted to decide a particular question in the Decision on Liability nor does
it request the rectification of a clerical, arithmetical or similar error. Ecuador also
accepts that Article 38(2) of the Arbitration Rules does not apply to pre-award
decisions and that, in the present case, it cannot apply since the proceedings still
have not been closed. At best, Rule 38(2) could have applied by analogy if Ecuador
had requested to file new evidence just prior to the issuance of the Decision on
Liability, which it did not do.

Finally, Article 52 of the ICSID Convention deals with annulment proceedings.
Unlike revision proceedings which, as a rule, are conducted by the tribunal which
issued the litigious decision, annulment actions are brought before a different body,
namely (under the ICSID regime) before an annulment committee. If it were to
assume the power to rule on a challenge based on grounds falling within the scope
of Article 52, the Tribunal would in effect exercise a competence reserved for
another body in disregard of the organization of powers under the ICSID
Convention.

In conclusion, it is the Tribunal’s view that a decision preliminary to an ICSID award
(other than a procedural order or decision on provisional measures) is not a res
judicata until it is incorporated into the award pursuant to Article 48(3) of the
Convention, but that it nonetheless binds the parties and the tribunal. Therefore,
such decisions can be reconsidered only in exceptional and very limited
circumstances. Absent any specific rule in the ICSID framework, the most
reasonable approach is to apply by analogy the test for revision provided in Article
51 of the Convention. This is so mainly because, under Article 51, the power of
revision is in principle entrusted to the tribunal that issued the litigious decision. By
contrast, it does not appear appropriate to resort to Article 52 by analogy, since the

40

109.

110.

111.

112.

113.

power to annul awards is vested in a body other than the tribunal that issued the
decision. An analogy with the grounds of Article 52 would thus disturb the allocation
of powers mandated by the ICSID Convention. Furthermore, considerations of
efficiency of the dispute settlement process and of manageability of the proceedings
call for the application of strict limits so as to avoid opening the floodgates of
reconsideration requests.

Having reached these conclusions, the Tribunal will now review the two grounds for
reconsideration raised by Ecuador.

2.2 The Tribunal erred as a matter of law

Ecuador alleges that the Tribunal erred as a matter of law with respect to its “sua
sponte interpretation” of Article 74 HL and the contradiction concerning the exceptio
non adimpleti contractus. |n this context, Ecuador argues that the Tribunal breached
the Parties’ due process rights, since the Parties only discussed Article 74 HL in the
context of caducidad, whereas the Tribunal’s interpretation of that provision
addressed suspension and intervention.

To the extent that Ecuador asserts that the Tribunal’s interpretation of Article 74 HL
and the decision to dispense with analyzing whether Burlington could also rely on
the exceptio non adimpleti contractus, are errors of law, the Tribunal agrees with
Burlington that these submissions amount to an appeal. As was discussed above,
appeals are impermissible under Article 53 of the ICSID Convention.

Turning then to due process, Ecuador complains that the Tribunal’s interpretation of
Article 74(4) HL “was never debated nor proposed by the Parties in the liability
phase”.'® For Ecuador, that provision does not address the power to intervene in
the Blocks and take over the operations, but relates to caducidad only. According to
Ecuador, subject to force majeure, the law of Ecuador and the PSCs barred the
Consortium from suspending its operations, on the grounds of the principle of
continuity. On that basis, Ecuador argues that it had inherent or implicit powers to
perform the PSCs in lieu of the Consortium in default, and that it could therefore
intervene in the Blocks and assume operations when it did.

Following the approach outlined above, this complaint falls within the scope of
Article 52 and thus within the remit of an ad hoc committee. This being so, the
Tribunal is mindful of the SCB decision which does not appear to entirely rule out

a

resort to Article 52 by analogy. Indeed, paragraph 320 quoted above refers to the
decision being “reopened or subject to annulment”. With this opinion in mind and
although it favors limiting the power of reconsideration to cases within the ambit
Article 51 for the reasons explained above, the Tribunal will nevertheless briefly
address this complaint, for the sake of completeness.

The record shows that Article 74(4) HL was debated prior to the issuance of the
Decision on Liability in connection with suspension and intervention. The second
expert report of Ecuador’s expert, Dr. Aguilar, discusses Article 74(4) HL in the
context of the principle of continuity and suspension of operations.'?® Further,
Ecuador cited the text of Article 74(4) HL in its Counter-Memorial and added that
“Burlington’s unilateral decision to suspend operations in Blocks 7 and 21, without
cause, was illegal both under the Ecuadorian Constitution and under the HCL”.'°°

Furthermore, compliance with fundamental principles of procedure and especially
the parties’ opportunity to be heard does not mean that a tribunal cannot adopt its
own reasoning.'3' The maxim of iura novit curia allows the Tribunal to establish and
assess the content of the law without being constrained by the Parties’ arguments,
as long as it remains within the legal framework established by the Parties. '°? Since
both Parties provided their views on the scope of Article 74(4) HL during the liability
phase, the Tribunal’s interpretation of that provision is clearly within the legal
framework set by the Parties. The same is true in respect of the arguments on the
principle of continuity'®® and the provisions dealing with suspension and intervention
in the hydrocarbons sector. 4

the public services described in Article 249 of the 1998 Constitution, which was later
replaced by Article 314 of the 2008 Constitution. See also: Aguilar ER2, 7 36-37.

sector, the telecommunications sector or the mining sector — is explicitly regulated under

In conclusion, this leg of the Motion is denied.

2.3 The Tribunal was misled on the facts

Ecuador alternatively argues that Burlington wrongfully withheld key evidence and
misled the Tribunal. Ecuador invokes the Suspension Plan as the decisive fact
which would affect the outcome of the Tribunal’s determination that Burlington was
unlawfully expropriated of its assets. This leg of the Motion falls within the scope of
Article 51 applied by analogy. The Tribunal must thus review whether Ecuador's
arguments fulfill the requirements of Article 51. They do not.

Indeed, Ecuador knew of the existence of the Suspension Plan since 2011 when
Burlington noted that it was privileged in its privilege log. Ecuador later obtained the
Suspension Plan on 1 August 2012 through document disclosure in the parallel
Perenco case.'** Burlington thereafter produced the document in this arbitration on
14 November 2012 to Ecuador's” and Ecuador filed it on 14 December 2012,'%* on
the day of issuance of the Decision on Liability. Accordingly, 135 days lapsed
between the moment when Ecuador became aware of the content of the
Suspension Plan and when it produced that document in this arbitration. From
August to December 2012, Ecuador had ample opportunity to advise the Tribunal
that it had come into possession of a document that it regarded as decisive to the
outcome of the case.

On this basis alone, this leg of the Motion fails and the Tribunal could dispense with
further analysis. This said, the Tribunal recognizes that there is another view on the
adequacy of applying the time limit of Article 51(2) of the Convention to requests for
revision of pre-award decisions and, because the Parties have extensively argued
this part of the Motion, the Tribunal will nevertheless briefly consider further
arguments advanced by the Parties.

 

telling that Ecuador amended Article 11 HL in 2010 to provide for intervention in the
hydrocarbons sector. In other words, in July 2009, the only topical provisions were Article
74(4) HL read in conjunction with Article 75. (Law Reforming the Hydrocarbons Law and the
Internal Tax System Law, Official Registry No. 244, 27 July 2010, Article 5(g) (Exh. Pérez-

The Tribunal agrees with Burlington that Ecuador cannot now argue that it entered
into Blocks 7 and 21 because of alleged risks justifying intervention and, argue at
the same time, that it discovered these risks when it obtained a copy of the
Suspension Plan.

It is true that Ecuador argues that its ability to rely on the Suspension Plan during
the liability phase was compromised by Burlington’s allegedly wrongful invocation of
privilege. However, that argument fails, since the Tribunal considers that the
Suspension Plan is indeed privileged under the work product doctrine, as it was
generated by in-house and outside counsel for Perenco for the purposes of ongoing
arbitral proceedings. '%° Accordingly, it could only have been produced once Perenco
consented to lift the privilege.

Moreover, the Tribunal also notes that the Suspension Plan contains no factual
information that was previously unknown to the Parties or the Tribunal, nor was it
susceptible of decisively influencing the outcome of the Decision on Liability.

First, Burlington demonstrated that the Suspension Plan was the starting point of
discussions on risks associated with the suspension, which was later superseded by
other discussions between the Consortium partners, such as the meeting held in
Bogota on 18-19 June 2009 and the Suspension Plan’s review on 30 June 2009. ‘4°
Second, the Consortium offered on two occasions to provide Ecuador with
“additional details about the suspension activities”, but Ecuador did not follow up on
these offers prior to intervening in the Blocks on 16 July 2009.'*' Third, for
Ecuador's expert RPS, the Suspension Plan showed that the Consortium conducted
a risk assessment in or around June 2009.'#* The expert added that that document
“expressly recognizes the risks and uncertainties” which RPS had previously
identified during the liability phase in relation to reservoir damage, mechanical
damage and serious economic loss, as well as risks of sabotage and looting. '** RPS.

The document bears an identification number of Debevoise & Plimpton, thus demonstrating
that it was generated by lawyers with input from technicians (Suspension Plan) dated 3 June
2009 (Exh. E-309). See: Tr. Quantum (Day 5) (ENG), 1438:22-1439:20 (Closing, Mr.

also insisted that prior to the Decision on Liability, it “lacked the specific data
necessary to decisively refute the testimony of Mr. Martinez” that there were no
significant risks associated with suspension. '** Be this as it may, these risks were
abundantly debated prior to the Decision on Liability and the Suspension Plan adds
nothing new in this respect, let alone does it provide the “specific data” that RPS
required to assess the concreteness of the risks it had identified.

As a result, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that this leg of the Motion does not
meet the conditions of Article 51 applied by analogy and must consequently be
denied.

2.4 Conclusion

For these reasons, the Motion is denied.

QUANTUM

In its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that, by taking over Blocks 7 and 21
(which takeover became permanent on 30 August 2009), Ecuador expropriated
Burlington's investments,'*® and that this expropriation was unlawful.'4° The
Tribunal’s task here is to determine what compensation is due to Burlington for
Ecuador's treaty breach.

The Tribunal will first provide an overview of the Parties’ positions (Section A) and
address the question of the standard of compensation (Section B). It will then
determine whether the heads of claim sought by Burlington are compensable
(Section C), followed by the valuation of the claims that pass this test (Section D). It
will conclude its analysis with an assessment of Ecuador’s defense on contributory
negligence (Section E) and Burlington’s request for post-award interest (Section F).

A. OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

1. Overview of Burlington’s position

Burlington argues that it is entitled to full reparation for the losses resulting from

Ecuador's unlawful expropriation of its investment, which (according to Burlington)

the Tribunal defined expressly to include Burlington’s contractual rights.”

Burlington seeks compensation for the following three categories of losses:

Past Law 42 dues paid or seized by Ecuador, i.e., “[t]he accrued amounts
owing to Burlington at the time of the expropriation as a result of Ecuador's
failure to indemnify Burlington for Law 42 payments and seizures effected
previously”."“® Burlington’s quantum expert, Dr. Abdala of Compass Lexecon,
calls this head of claim “pre-expropriation tax debts” and has calculated them
from the day those taxes became effective (20 April 2006) until the date of the
expropriation (30 August 2009).'*° Burlington characterizes these losses as
“lost contract rights”. ‘°°

The Jost profits that Burlington would have received under the PSCs absent (or
“but for”) Ecuador’s unlawful acts. Compass Lexecon refers to this head of
damages as the value of Burlington’s expropriated operating assets.'®'
According to Burlington, the valuation of these lost profits must take into
account Burlington’s contractual right to be indemnified against Law 42.
Accordingly Compass Lexecon calculates these lost profits net of the economic
effects of Law 42.

Burlington’s lost opportunity to engage in good faith negotiations with regard
to an extension of the Block 7 PSC.'®* Compass Lexecon refers to this head of
damages as the “Value of Block 7 Extension”.

In its Second Report, Compass Lexecon quantifies these damages as follows:

Source: Compass Lexecon Second Valuation Model. (CLEX-49)

Burlington claims compound interest on all of these amounts and requests that the
award be protected against taxation.

In the Updated Model, using a valuation date of 31 August 2016 and all of Compass
Lexecon’s assumptions, Burlington's damages are quantified damages at
USD 1,515,603,095, including pre-award interest.

2. Overview of Ecuador’s position

Ecuador denies that Burlington has a right to be compensated for the pre-
expropriation tax debts, or for the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC. First, it
submits that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over either of these claims, which in its
view are contract and not treaty claims. Even if the Tribunal should find that it has
jurisdiction, says Ecuador, both claims fail on their merits.

By contrast, and of course subject to its motion for reconsideration, Ecuador
acknowledges that Burlington has a right to the fair market value (FMV) of its
expropriated investment (which Ecuador appears to accept is reflected in the value
of its rights under the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 on the date of the expropriation).
However, it contends that Burlington’s valuation of these assets is grossly inflated,
mainly because Burlington misapplies the relevant standard of compensation, uses
the wrong valuation date, adopts false assumptions (in particular, the failure to
account for Law 42 taxes when projecting future profits) and applies an exaggerated

interest rate.

Ecuador argues that, in any event, any compensation awarded to Burlington must
reflect Burlington’s contribution to its own losses.

Finally, Ecuador argues that Burlington's claim for interest is unreasonable.

In the Updated Model, using a valuation date of 30 August 2009 and all of Fair
Links’ assumptions, Ecuador's valuation of the Burlington’s base case scenario is
quantified at USD 27,597,980, including pre-award interest.

B. STANDARD OF COMPENSATION
1. Burlington’s position

Burlington argues that, because the Tribunal found that the expropriation was
unlawful, the appropriate standard of compensation is the customary international
law standard of full reparation. Relying in particular on the Chorzow case,‘ as well
as on the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the “ILC Articles’),'5° Burlington
submits that this standard requires that the award fully eliminate the consequences
of Ecuador's unlawful conduct, and reestablish the situation that would have existed
in the absence of that unlawful conduct. '®”

The Tribunal understands these figures to be in million USD.

Indemnity) (The Merits), Permanent Court of International Justice, Series A., No. 17,

In the context of an unlawful expropriation, “the tribunal's task is to require the State
to place the investor in the economic position that it would have enjoyed had the
wrongful acts never occurred — that is, the situation that would have existed ‘but for’
the unlawful expropriation”.'®* If restitution is impossible or impracticable, as here,
the Tribunal should make an award of damages “equal to the current value of the
investment taken, plus compensation for any losses that would not have been
incurred but for the State’s unlawful actions”. "©?

According to Burlington, this standard applies to all unlawful expropriations,
regardless of the breach that caused that unlawfulness. It argues that Article III(1) of
the BIT provides that all expropriations are unlawful (this being the default position
agreed by the contracting States), unless four cumulative conditions are met: the
taking must be (i) for a public interest, (ii) non-discriminatory, (iii) in accordance with
due process of law, and (iv) upon payment of compensation.'® Stated differently, if
any one of these conditions is not met, the expropriation is unlawful. Burlington
submits that the Treaty makes no distinction between these conditions, and there is
no authority under international law to make one.'®' There is thus no basis for
Ecuador's theory that a failure to pay compensation “somehow renders an
expropriation ‘less unlawful”. '©2

As the Treaty itself does not provide the standard of compensation for unlawful
expropriations, Burlington argues that the Tribunal must turn to the customary
international law standard. Any expropriation carried out in violation of Article III(1)
thus triggers the full reparation standard set out in Chorzdw. Restitution is not
feasible and so the Tribunal must award compensation sufficient to wipe out all of
the consequences of the illegal act.

Burlington contends that, as with the other requirements for a lawful expropriation,
the compensation requirement would serve no practical purpose if an expropriation
that violated the requirement attracted the same remedial consequences as an
expropriation that complied with the requirement, with the result that there would be

Mem., 4 52.

no incentive for States to pay prompt, adequate and effective compensation. '®
Upholding Ecuador's position would incite States to expropriate industries with likely
increases in value so as to limit liability to the value at the time of the initial seizure,
and impose a “hierarchy of unlawfulness” that does not exist in the BIT or any other
investment treaty. "+

According to Burlington, far from being an “anomaly” as claimed by Ecuador,
tribunals regularly awarded full reparation in cases of expropriation that are unlawful
for failure to pay compensation, as demonstrated in ConocoPhillips (a case relied
upon by Ecuador, except for this specific matter), Unglaube, Siemens and
Funnekotter.'© Furthermore, leading commentators such as Dolzer and Schreuer
do not provide any support for “the notion that some unlawful expropriations are
remedied differently from others”. '

Burlington submits that Ecuador's recited authorities are not persuasive in this
regard. For Burlington, the case law of the European Court of Human Rights
(ECtHR), which distinguishes between “inherently unlawful dispossession” and
expropriation unlawful by failure to pay compensation, provides “limited, if any,
guidance on a State’s remedial obligations to foreign investors under investment
treaties”.'°” The ECtHR deals with takings by a State of property of its own
nationals, and therefore applies different standards of protection than those
applicable in international investment law. The doctrine of the “margin of
appreciation”, and thus a larger degree of deference to the State, is also inept in the
international investment context, as confirmed in Siemens and Quasar,'® and
indeed by the ECtHR itself in Lithgow."

Burlington adds that the scholarly authorities relied on by Ecuador are similarly
unpersuasive. Audley Sheppard’s advocacy for the abolition of any distinction
between takings in the context of the ECT, disregards Article 31 VCLT and is
unsupported by the text and structure of Article III(1) of the BIT, which makes clear
that “the elements of a lawful expropriation are cumulative and of equal
importance”.'7° And while Brownlie speaks of the failure to pay compensation as
unlawful sub modo, he acknowledges that any expropriation in breach of a treaty
provision is illegal per se.'7'

In any event, argues Burlington, Ecuador’s arguments are ultimately irrelevant, since
the expropriation failed to satisfy any of the four criteria set out in Article III(1) of the
BIT.172

i. First, it served no public purpose. The Tribunal found that Burlington had just
cause to suspend operations. It also held that evidence did not support the
contention that suspension created significant risks. Since Ecuador violated its
own laws, no /egitimate public purpose was served by the taking.'°

ii. Second, the taking was discriminatory.'74 Ecuador offered compensation to
other oil companies, but not to Burlington.

iii. Third, Ecuador admits that it did not offer compensation. '”

iv. Fourth, no due process of law was followed, there being no reasonable advance
notice, no fair hearing, and no unbiased and impartial adjudicator.'”° In fact,

Ecuador, through President Correa, admitted that Decree 662 was a
“pressuring” measure intended to force investors to abandon their contracts. '””
Ecuador also failed to abide by order on provisional measures set out in PO1 by
persisting with the coactiva process, thus violating Burlington’s procedural
rights.'”® According to Burlington, “[a]n expropriation effected through the
violation of an investor's procedural rights and flouting the orders of an
international tribunal cannot be found consistent with due process of law”.17°

v. Finally, the expropriation also breached the FET standard of Article II(3) of the
BIT, which is expressly incorporated into Article III(1) of the BIT.'®° Specifically,
Ecuador breached the FET standard by failing to respect due process, as well
as through its conduct leading up to the expropriation, which “nullified by
sovereign action Burlington’s core rights”,"®' as recognized by the Tribunal. By
finding that Burlington had “just cause” to suspend operations, the Tribunal
“perforce” recognized that the taking “was linked with, and premised upon, State
conduct” violating Article II(3) of the BIT.'®? In particular, the refusal to absorb
Law 42 and the seizures, “were necessary links in the chain that ultimately led
to the formal expropriation”. ®

As a result, Burlington submits that the Tribunal should award compensation
equivalent to “full reparation”, that is, compensation that fully eliminates the
economic consequences of Ecuador’s unlawful acts. While Burlington agrees that
this compensation should reflect the FMV of its lost investment, '®* it emphasizes

that what matters when compensating an unlawful expropriation is what the investor
has lost as a result of the State’s unlawful conduct. '®

2.  Ecuador’s position

Ecuador contends that the applicable standard of compensation is not found in
customary international law, but in Article III(1) itself, which provides:

“Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the
expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action
was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be calculated in a
freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market rate of
exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a
commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully
realizable and be freely transferable”. '°

As a result, in the Respondent's submission, Burlington is only entitled to the fair
market value of its investment, valued on the date of expropriation, plus interest
from the date of the taking.

Ecuador's primary case is that this standard applies to all expropriations, whether
lawful or unlawful, and regardless of the breach giving rise to the unlawfulness. 1°”
Ecuador argues that Burlington is wrong to contend that the simple failure to pay
compensation inexorably leads to a standard of compensation different from the one

in the BIT. Burlington’s cited authorities do not support that proposition, nor does the
text of the Treaty lead to such a result. As Funnekotter makes clear, case law “is not
perfectly clear” as to whether the treaty standard of compensation does or does not
apply in cases of unlawful expropriation, “particularly in case of lack of
compensation”.' The Iran-US Claims Tribunal, and in particular the views
expressed by Judge Brower, show that the treaty standard, not customary
international law, was applied in cases of expropriation that was lawful save for the
lack of compensation.'®® Audley Sheppard has opined that “in the absence of clear
language to the contrary”, the treaty standard is applicable in all cases of
expropriation, whether lawful or not.'®° This position has been adopted in a “long line
of cases”, such as Wena, Middle East Cement, Tecmed, Goetz, Rumeli, CME,
Sistem in a BIT context (where there was no material difference between the BIT
language in those cases and here), and Metalclad or SD Myers in the NAFTA
context. 191

Quoting Judge Brower’s Dissenting Opinion in Amoco, Ecuador argues that to resort
to customary international law would be “to ignore the fact that the State Parties to
the Treaty [...] have carefully negotiated an express commitment in that Treaty
precisely in order to avoid to the maximum extent possible any future reference to
customary international law”.'? Relying on Phillips Petroleum, Ecuador submits that
“where the Contracting Parties have stipulated a standard of compensation in their
Treaty, something more is required to be found in the text of the Treaty itself in order
to ignore the application of that carefully stipulated and negotiated commitment
between the State Parties”.'® In this case, “[t]he text of the Treaty reveals no test by

which to limit the application of the Article III(1) standard of compensation to some
but not all unlawful expropriations”.'®* Burlington is asking the Tribunal to rewrite the
BIT. 195

Ecuador contends that, “at a minimum, Article Ill(1) standard applies to
expropriations which, having complied with the conduct requirements of the Treaty,
were unaccompanied by compensation”, as is the case here.'°° This is evident from
the requirement in Article III(1) that interest be paid from the date of the
expropriation: if the treaty standard did not apply to expropriations lacking
compensation, then there would have been no need to stipulate that compensation
should include interest from the date of the expropriation. “It follows that, even if,
quod non, Burlington succeeds in convincing the Tribunal to revisit its findings on
liability and hold that the purported taking of Burlington’s investment was unlawful
for reasons other than because it was unaccompanied by prompt, adequate and
effective compensation, the Treaty standard of compensation would still apply to the
exclusion of customary international law”.'°”

Alternatively, Ecuador submits that customary international law leads to the same
result. Relying on Chorzéw, Ecuador contends that “[t]he remedial response to an
unlawful taking differs under customary international law depending on whether the
taking would have been lawful ‘but for’ the payment of compensation”. '°® Where (as
here) an expropriation would have been lawful if compensation had been paid, the
State’s obligation is “limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of the
dispossession, plus interest to the day of payment”. °°

Ecuador denies that the expropriation can be characterized as unlawful for other
violations of Article III(1), as Burlington alleges. First, the Tribunal has found that it
has no ratione materiae jurisdiction to address Burlington’s claim based on fair and
equitable treatment, arbitrary impairment and full protection and security, which are
premised on the legal notions of “public purpose”, “discrimination”, “due process of

law’, “fairness” and “equity”. Burlington cannot now reintroduce these claims through
the back door.?°°

Second, the Tribunal has already dismissed Burlington's allegations. In the Decision
on Liability, the Tribunal considered the same allegations that Burlington now seeks
to repeat, but declared that Ecuador's purported expropriation was unlawful solely
on the basis of lack of compensation. This means that the Tribunal did not accept
Burlington's allegations that the expropriation had breached other conditions of
Article III(1). No other conclusion can be drawn from the Tribunal’s silence. The
dispositive section of the Decision on Liability confirms that Burlington’s other
allegations regarding the unlawfulness of the expropriation were dismissed.”

Third, Burlington has not filed a motion for reconsideration on these counts.

Lastly, if, par impossible, the Tribunal should decide to enter into the merits of
Burlington's alternative case, it should dismiss it for the following reasons:

i. Ecuador has demonstrated through its Motion for Reconsideration that under
Ecuadorian law it was entitled to take over Blocks 7 and 21, given the risks
identified in the Consortium’s Suspension Plan (among other documents).?02

ii. There is no evidence on record to support the allegation that the expropriation
was discriminatory. The other companies referred to by Burlington as having
received compensation from Ecuador were not in the same circumstances as
Burlington, in particular because they accepted to renegotiate their oil contracts,
migrate them to service contracts and pay Law 42 taxes, whereas Burlington
did not.

iii. While it is undisputed that Burlington has not received compensation for
Ecuador's purported expropriation, it is also undisputed that, had Burlington not
torpedoed the Consortium’s negotiations with Ecuador, the Consortium would
have entered into transitory agreements with the State and eventually either
continued to operate the Blocks under service contracts, or discussed with the
State the liquidation of the PSCs, which under Ecuador's new hydrocarbon legal
framework would have led to compensation. That being said, Ecuador

emphasizes that Burlington is owed no compensation in accordance with Article

75 of the Hydrocarbons Law and the Caducidad Decrees.”

iv. Finally, there is no evidence on record showing that Ecuador's purported

expropriation was carried out in violation of due process or any of the elements

in Article II(3). It is untenable for Burlington to have abandoned the oilfields and

then allege that the State, which had no choice but to intervene in the Blocks,

did not follow a “process of law’. In any event Ecuador followed the procedure

for emergency situations.?°° According to Ecuador, Burlington also ignores five

relevant facts:206

The Consortium (as recognized by the Perenco tribunal) failed to provide
the State with the economic study required for the tax renegotiation
clauses to be triggered. It was thus the Consortium’s own fault if the
Parties did not follow the contractual procedure foreseen in Clauses 11.12
and 15.2 of the PSC for Block 7 or Clauses 11.7 and 15.2 of the PSC for
Block 21.207

Ecuador considered, in accordance with the ICSID Convention, that the
provisional measures adopted in PO1 were “mere recommendations and,
hence, not binding upon the State”.°® According to Ecuador, “[n]o breach
of due process of law may occur for not following some recommendations.
If, however, those provisional measures were to be considered binding
upon Ecuador (quod non), their breach does not entail a violation of any of
the elements (right of defense, equality of the parties, etc.) forming the
due process of law principle”.2°

Ecuador invited the Consortium several times to resume operations in the
Blocks, without success. Burlington’s reaction was disproportionate in the
circumstances.?"°

d. The internal rate of return offered by Ecuador for the service contracts
was the same as the one implied in the economy of the PSCs,?"" and

e. _ If due process of law was violated by Ecuador’s purported expropriation,

administrative courts, which it chose not to do.?'2

For these reasons, Ecuador argues that “Burlington’s renewed attempt to
circumvent the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and findings on liability should be given short
shrift”.2"5

3. Analysis

In the Tribunal’s view, the appropriate standard of compensation in this case is the
customary international law standard of full reparation. Article III(1) only describes
the conditions under which an expropriation is considered lawful; it does not set out
the standard of compensation for expropriations resulting from breaches of the
Treaty. This conclusion has been reaffirmed in a number of cases where the treaty
in question had similar language.*"4 The authorities cited by Ecuador in this regard
are unpersuasive: it is clear in this case that the Treaty provides the primary rules of
international law, i.e., the State’s substantive obligations, and not the secondary
rules, i.e., those that determine the State’s responsibility for breach of those

obligations. In the absence of such a secondary rule in the Treaty, the Tribunal must
turn to customary international law.

However, during the quantum phase, Ecuador has argued that the standard of
compensation under customary international law is different for expropriations that
are unlawful solely as a result of the failure to pay compensation as opposed to
expropriations that are unlawful on other grounds.'> This is a question that was not
pleaded during the liability phase and that the Decision on Liability did not address.
As the conditions set out in Article III(1) of the Treaty are cumulative, in the Decision
on Liability the Tribunal concluded its analysis of the lawfulness of the expropriation
after having found that Ecuador had breached one of those conditions (specifically,
the requirement to pay or offer compensation). This was done in the interest of
procedural efficiency, not because Ecuador's failure to pay compensation was
necessarily the only breach of Article III(1). At that stage, the Parties’ submissions
did not require the Tribunal to proceed any further with its legality analysis. This
being said, given Ecuador’s argument during this phase according to which the
nature of the unlawfulness of an expropriation impacts the quantum of damages, the
Tribunal has re-examined the Parties’ arguments and evidence and concludes that
Ecuador failed to comply with other conditions set by Article III(1) for a lawful
expropriation.

Doing so, contrary to Ecuador’s suggestion, the Tribunal is not contradicting or
reconsidering the Decision on Liability. In that Decision, the Tribunal declared that
“Ecuador breached Article Ill of the Treaty by unlawfully expropriating Burlington's
investment in Blocks 7 and 21 as of 30 August 2009”;?"° it did not declare that
Ecuador's expropriation was unlawful solely on the basis of lack of compensation.
Likewise, the Tribunal declared that “all different or contrary requests for relief in
connection with Ecuador's liability are dismissed”;?"” it did not dismiss Burlington's
allegations that the expropriation was unlawful also due to other reasons. The
Tribunal’s finding that the expropriation was unlawful because it did not meet one of
the conditions of Article III(1) of the Treaty was sufficient for its Decision on Liability.
Whether or not Ecuador breached the remaining conditions of Article III(1) is now
raised by Ecuador as a factor allegedly relevant to establish the standard of

that the treaty standard should apply).

compensation, which is a question for the quantum phase of the proceedings, as is
shown by the fact that the Parties have submitted extensive arguments on this
subject in this phase. The Tribunal now turns to that question.

Article IIl(1) of the Treaty provides in relevant part as follows:

“Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly
or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or
nationalization (“expropriation”) except: for a public purpose; in a
nondiscriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and
effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law
and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(3)”.

As this language shows, Article III(1) expressly incorporates the requirement that, to
be lawful, an expropriation must be carried out in accordance with the general
principles of treatment provided in Article II(3) of the Treaty, which reads as follows:

“(a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable
treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in
no case be accorded treatment less than that required by
international law.

(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or
discriminatory measures the management, operation,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or
disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution
under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or
discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or
has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the
courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.

(c) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered
into with regard to investments”.

In the Tribunal’s view, the combination of these two provisions means that, to be
lawful, an expropriation must be carried out (i) for a public purpose; (ii) in a non-
discriminatory manner; (iii) upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective
compensation, (iv) in accordance with due process of law; (vi) in accordance with
the principle of fair and equitable treatment, including in particular the requirement
that the expropriation not be arbitrary*"® and that it be conducted in accordance with
the minimum standard of treatment; (vii) in accordance with the principle of full
protection and security, and (viii) without breaching obligations it may have entered
with regard to investments.

In the Tribunal’s view, the prohibition of arbitrary conduct is already included in the fair and
equitable treatment standard.

60

168.

The Tribunal rejects Ecuador's argument that it has no jurisdiction to determine
whether an expropriation was carried out in accordance with the general principles
provided for in Article II(3). It is true that, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal
held that it had no jurisdiction over Burlington’s separate fair and equitable treatment
claim, arbitrary impairment claim, and full protection and security claim.?'° However,
it has upheld jurisdiction over Burlington’s expropriation claim, and the Treaty
standard expressly provides that, to be lawful, an expropriation must be carried out,
inter alia, in accordance with the general principles contained in Article II(3). To
ignore this would contradict the plain language of Article III(1) and render the phrase
“in accordance with [...] the general principles of treatment provided for in Article
Il(3)” without effet utile. This does not mean that Burlington may revive FET claims
through the back door. The Tribunal’s analysis is limited to determining whether the
expropriation (which the Tribunal has found occurred when the physical takeover of
the Blocks became permanent)?” was carried out in accordance with these general
principles.

It arises from the record underlying the Decision on Liability and this Award that the
expropriation was not carried out in accordance with the general principles of
treatment provided in Article II(3). Indeed, the Tribunal finds that the expropriation
was not carried out in accordance with the principle of fair and equitable treatment,
which is a condition of a lawful expropriation under Article III(1) referring to Article
Il(3), even under a stringent interpretation of that standard.

The tribunal in Waste Management II defined the minimum standard of treatment
under customary international law (which provides the floor for the fair and equitable
treatment standard) as follows:

“[T]he minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment
is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the
claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or
idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional
or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an
outcome which offends judicial propriety—as might be the case with a
manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete
lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process”.”*!

Having said that, Mondev clarified that “[t]lo the modern eye, what is unfair or
inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious” and that “a state
may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in
bad faith”.*?2 It also observed that "[a] judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot
be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case”.°*
The Tribunal concurs.

Burlington argues that “[u]nder any reading of [the FET] standard, a state’s use of its
sovereign power to expropriate an investment in retribution for an investor's refusal
to surrender its rights in specific legal instruments designed for, and afforded to, the
investor by the state is certainly a violation thereof”.?*4 The Tribunal agrees. Indeed,
after reviewing the totality of the circumstances that surrounded the takeover of the
Blocks, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Ecuador’s permanent takeover of
the Blocks, which it has found to have been without justification in the law and in the
facts,225 was the final step in a chain of harassment measures directed to forcing
Burlington to migrate the PSCs into service contracts or abandon them altogether.

As recognized in Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan, the obligation to provide fair and equitable
treatment includes “[t]he obligation not to exercise unreasonable pressure on an
investor to reach certain goals”. While that tribunal considered that such conduct
constituted a violation of due process (which is one aspect of the fair and equitable
treatment standard), other tribunals have considered that such harassment violated
the fair and equitable treatment or minimum standards of treatment more generally.
For instance, the Tecmed tribunal found that the state agency's denial of a license
extension was “a means to pressure [the investor] and force it to assume a similar
operation in another site, bearing the costs and risks of a new business”, and that
“[u]nder such circumstances, such pressure involve[d] forms of coercion that may be
considered inconsistent with the fair and equitable treatment” standard?”

Here, the record shows that Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks was the final step ina
series of acts of harassment directed against Burlington in order to force it to
renegotiate the PSCs. As reported in the Ecuadorian press, President Correa stated
that Decree 662, which increased the Law 42 dues to 99%, “was only a ‘pressuring
measure’ for the parties to sit down to negotiate”.?® Ecuador has not disputed this.
Indeed, in the context of its analysis of whether Law 42 was expropriatory, the
Tribunal noted that “Ecuador argue[d] that Law 42 was intended to prompt oil
companies to negotiate with the State”.**° It reasoned that “[wJhile this goal may
have been related to Ecuador's view that the allocation of oil revenues under the
PSCs was unfair, it provides no ground to disregard Burlington’s rights under the
PSCs”,° adding that “Ecuador appear[ed] to have passed Law 42 without intending
to apply the correction factor required by the tax absorption clauses of the PSCs’”,
which “len[t] credence to Burlington's allegation that Law 42 was intended to force
Burlington to abdicate its rights under the PSCs”.25!

In this context, it bears repeating that the Tribunal has found that “by enacting Law
42 and then refusing to absorb its effect pursuant to the tax absorption clauses,
Ecuador has in effect nullified Burlington’s right to a correction factor by preventing
the exercise of this right. Moreover, this nullification was made possible through the
use of Ecuador’s sovereign powers. While both parties to the PSCs may invoke the
tax absorption clauses, only Ecuador, as a sovereign State, may increase taxes and
disregard this clause”.”* While this conduct may not have had an expropriatory
effect, it undoubtedly had an impact on Burlington’s business. Seen together with
President Correa’s statements quoted above, it confirms that Ecuador was using its
sovereign powers to pressure Burlington into negotiating.

While the Tribunal has dismissed the argument of a creeping expropriation, it did so
because the physical takeover of the Blocks constituted an expropriation in and of
itself.2%° That does not preclude the Tribunal from assessing whether the
expropriation was carried out in accordance with fair and equitable treatment. This
assessment cannot take place in a vacuum; it involves reviewing the totality of the

facts and circumstances surrounding the expropriation. Having done so, the Tribunal

holds that Ecuador's takeover of the Blocks was carried out in breach of the

principle of fair and equitable treatment.

The Tribunal further notes that none of Ecuador's additional arguments justifies the

conduct in breach of FET in the course of the expropriation:

Ecuador first argues that (as recognized by the Perenco tribunal), the
Consortium failed to provide the State with the economic study required for the
tax renegotiation clauses to be triggered and, as a result, it was the
Consortium’s own fault if the Parties did not follow the contractual procedure
foreseen in the PSCs. The findings of the Perenco tribunal are not binding on
the present Tribunal, but even if they were, the fact that the contractual
procedure for the application of the correction factor was not triggered would not
justify the adoption of pressuring measures to force an investor to renegotiate or
give up its investment.

Ecuador's arguments with respect to its failure to comply with the Tribunal’s
provisional measures are irrelevant in this context, as indeed are Burlington's.
While Ecuador's failure to comply with the Tribunal’s provisional measures
could have breached Burlington’s procedural rights, it does not in itself involve a
violation of due process with respect to the expropriation.

As to Ecuador's allegation that the Consortium refused to resume operations
despite Ecuador's invitation to do so, in its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal
found that Minister Pinto’s letter of 19 August 2009, in which Ecuador urged the
Consortium to resume operations within a maximum period of 10 days, was
“inconsistent with Burlington’s right to suspend operations with ‘just cause’ on
account of Ecuador's breaches of the PSCs and of [the] provisional measures
order” and, as a result, “Burlington had no obligation to accept Ecuador's
demand”. In any event, Ecuador's account is incorrect: as recorded in the
Decision on Liability, on 28 August 2009, the Consortium answered that it
“would be prepared to resume” operations provided that Ecuador brought itself
into compliance with its legal and contractual obligations, and there is no

demand was no different from that which had given rise to Burlington's right to suspend
operations with ‘just cause’ to begin with”. DoL, 4 533.

The Tribunal thus reaches the conclusion that the expropriation was unlawful not
only for failure to pay compensation. As a result, it can dispense with determining
whether the standard of compensation under customary international law is different
for expropriations that are unlawful solely as a result of the failure to pay
compensation as opposed to expropriations that are unlawful on other grounds.

The appropriate standard of compensation is thus the customary international law
standard of full reparation set out in Article 31 of the ILC Articles, applied by
analogy. While Part Two of the ILC Articles, which sets out the legal consequences
of internationally wrongful acts and to which Article 31 belongs, is not applicable to
the international responsibility of States vis-a-vis non-States,* it is generally
accepted that the ILC Articles can be transposed to the context of investor-State
disputes.7°” ILC Article 31 provides that “[tlhe responsible State is under an
obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful
act”. Pursuant to this principle, first articulated in the landmark Chorzdw case,
“reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act
and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act
had not been committed”.23°

c. CATEGORIES OF COMPENSABLE LOSSES

Applying the relevant standard of compensation, Burlington is entitled to full
reparation for the losses resulting from Ecuador's unlawful expropriation of its
investment.

As anticipated in Section A above, Burlington claims three categories of losses:
(i) past Law 42 dues paid or seized (what the Claimant’s expert Compass Lexecon
calls “pre-expropriation tax debts”); (ii) its lost profits under the PSCs (what
Compass Lexecon calls the “value of the operating assets”), and (iii) the lost
opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC (what Compass Lexecon calls the “value of
Block 7 extension’).

The Tribunal will first determine whether Burlington is entitled to each of the heads
of damages it seeks (this Section B), starting with the past Law 42 dues (Section 1
below), followed by the value of Burlington's operating assets (Section 2 below), and
ending with Burlington’s claim for the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC
(Section 3 below). If it determines that any of these categories of claims constitutes
a compensable loss, it will discuss its valuation in Section C below.

1. Past Law 42 dues
1.1 Burlington’s position

Burlington claims that it is entitled “to recover damages equal to all Law 42 amounts
paid under protest or extracted in kind through the coactiva seizures”,°° which
Burlington characterizes as “lost contract rights” and Compass Lexecon refers to as
“pre-expropriation tax debts”. In the Updated Model, using Compass Lexecon’s
assumptions this claim is quantified at USD 298,639,960, including pre-award
interest. Burlington puts forth five main arguments in this respect.

 

239

Concurring Opinion of Judge Brower at § 18 (Exh. CL-173) (“In my view Chorzow Factory
presents a simple scheme: If an expropriation is lawful, the deprived party is to be awarded
damages equal to the ‘value of the undertaking’ which it has lost, including any potential
future profits, as of the date of the taking; in the case of an unlawful taking, however, either
the injured party is to be actually restored to enjoyment of his property, or, should this be
impossible or impractical, he is to be awarded damages equal to the greater of (i) the value
of the undertaking at the date of loss (again including lost profits), judged on the basis of
information available as of that date, and (ii) its value (likewise including lost profits) as
shown by its probable performance subsequent to the date of loss and prior to the date of
the award, based on actual post taking experience, plus (in either alternative) any
consequential damage”).

First, Burlington contends that these lost contract rights were assets that were
expropriated and, as such, for which it must be compensated. According to
Burlington, when Ecuador expropriated its investment, it “took everything of value
relating to Burlington’s investments in Blocks 7 and 21, including Burlington's
contractual rights”.”4° In particular, says Burlington, Ecuador took its right under the
PSCs to have a correction factor applied to absorb the effects of Law 42, a right that
the Tribunal found to be “part and parcel” of Burlington’s investment.?4’ For
Burlington, this right was a protection against both past and future taxes. As a result,
“by unlawfully expropriating the PSCs, Ecuador not only deprived Burlington of its
future rights under those contracts, it also deprived Burlington of its acquired rights —
the right to be indemnified by Ecuador for the sums paid and seized under Law
42’. Burlington adds that “Ecuador cannot be permitted to wipe out its own debts
by unlawfully expropriating the contracts pursuant to which those debts are
owed”. 243

According to Burlington, the Decision on Liability confirms that past Law 42 dues
were expropriated. The Decision on Liability found that the investment had to be
viewed “as a whole” and not as discrete parts. It also found that the entire
investment had been expropriated, as it did not specify that there were parts of the
investment that were not taken. As a result, the Tribunal must now value that
investment “as a whole”.?44

The Decision on Liability also confirms, says Burlington, that the Claimant lost
everything that constituted its investment, including all of its rights related to the
investment. The Tribunal expressly found that “[w]hile Burlington still had its
subsidiary’s rights in the PSCs as well as the subsidiary’s shares, these rights and
shares had no value without possession of the oilfields and access to the oil’, and
that “[e]ven though these contract rights were still nominally in force after the
takeover [...], they were bereft of any real value from the moment Burlington
permanently lost effective use and control of its investment’, which according to the

Tribunal occurred when Ecuador entered the oilfields and physically occupied the
Blocks, a situation that became permanent on 30 August 2009.45

In addition, Burlington continues, the Decision on Liability confirms that what was
expropriated was “not a simple accrued debt”, but “a contractual adjustment that
requires a contractual mechanism”.”“° Specifically, when discussing the content of
the tax absorption clause and the impact of Law 42 on the PSCs, the Tribunal
considered that the parties jointly were required to calculate the readjustment and
that “Law 42 trigger[ed] the contractual mechanism applicable in the event of a
modification to the tax system”, that is, an administrative procedure providing for
“the mandatory application of a correction factor’, which Burlington argues is a
contractual mechanism that arose from and depended on the existence of the
PSC.*47 Ecuador was required to apply this contractual mechanism but failed to do
so, and so breached the PSC. On the date of the expropriation, Ecuador was still
under an obligation to apply this mechanism. However, when the PSCs were
expropriated, the means by which Burlington could enforce that mechanism was
also expropriated. For Burlington, “the expropriation and the failure to apply the
correction factor and the contractual mechanism to get it were inextricably linked”.24°
The right to a mechanism to obtain that correction factor was “wrapped up” in the
investment in and the operation of the Blocks, which were lost with the seizure of the
oilfields on 30 August 2009. As found by the Tribunal, the right remained only
“nominally” in existence (given that caducidad would not be declared until almost
one year later), “bereft of any real value”, as the means to obtain the “mandatory”
correction was gone. Although Burlington may not have needed access to the oil to
obtain its past Law 42 payments, it certainly needed the PSCs themselves.°

As a result, the Claimant submits that its claim for indemnification for past Law 42
dues forms part of the expropriated investment. This was the approach taken by the
tribunal in Tidewater v. Venezuela, which held that, because Venezuela had
expropriated the claimant’s enterprise “as a whole, by assuming control in fact of its

business and all of its assets’, “the investment that was lost must include
outstanding unpaid accounts receivable”.?5°

In any event, the Claimant contends that “international law likewise requires that the
value of Burlington’s ‘investment’ includes the value of any accrued payments that
Ecuador owed to Burlington as of the date of expropriation, the right to which was
seized along with the Blocks”.*5' Relying on Tidewater, Siemens, and Tippets,
among other decisions, Burlington argues that international tribunals routinely
compensate expropriated parties for unpaid services or accrued debts. The contrary
would in fact create perverse incentives as States would be permitted to wipe out
accrued contractual liabilities through expropriation.*** Likewise, relying on Phillips
Petroleum, American International Group and Azurix, Burlington argues that
tribunals exclude from the calculation of compensation any diminution of value
resulting from prior wrongful acts by the State related to the expropriation or to the
enterprise at issue.5°

Burlington's second argument in favor of compensation for past Law 42 dues is that
since its contractual rights were nullified by sovereign action, the effects of
Ecuador's conduct must be wiped out. Burlington recalls that in the Decision on
Jurisdiction the Tribunal held that a breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard could only occur if Ecuador had acted in its sovereign capacity. Then, in
its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal held that Ecuador's failure to honor the tax
absorption clause was a measure taken in the exercise of its sovereign powers.*°°
Accordingly, the failure to absorb the effects of Law 42 was “an internationally
wrongful act involving Ecuador's sovereign power”.

191.

This is relevant, says Burlington, because Article IIl(1) of the Treaty incorporates a
requirement that expropriations be carried out in a fair and equitable manner.*” The
Tribunal’s findings confirm that the expropriation did not meet that requirement, as it
was preceded by sovereign acts nullifying Burlington’s “core rights”.2°° Burlington
notes that Ecuador itself acknowledged that Law 42 was part of a “plan to induce
foreign investors to abandon their rights”.°°° Burlington also points to Occidental II,
where the tribunal held that Law 42 breached the PSC and the investor's legitimate
expectations, thus violating the fair and equitable treatment standard under the
BIT.26°

Third, Burlington pleads that its position is consistent with the fact that the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction only covers Treaty breaches. It explains that “[t]he conduct for which
Burlington claims relief is not a breach of contract but the destruction of contract
rights by sovereign action, [...] the nullification of such rights”, which “must be by its
essence a treaty claim because only a sovereign can destroy contractual rights by
its action”.?°' Burlington claims no more than the value of the PSCs that were
unlawfully expropriated, and a significant part of that value is the accrued right to
reimbursement for Law 42 payments and seizures that occurred prior to the
expropriation.” This does not mean that this is a contract claim; it is a matter of
determining the value of the expropriated investment.76>

Ecuador fails to realize, argues Burlington, that arbitral tribunals routinely include the
value of lost contract rights when valuing expropriated assets even when those
tribunals were not presented with the contract claims themselves or lacked
jurisdiction over contract claims.” For instance, in Tippetts, the tribunal had no

jurisdiction over the contract which was the source of the right to claimed debts, but
nonetheless included unpaid invoices in its valuation. The same occurred in SPP
v. Egypt as well as in arbitrations arising from the Argentine debt crisis.?°° “This did
not mean [...] that the Tribunals in those cases were entertaining contract claims
[...]. Rather, they simply recognized that most investments are comprised of a
bundle of contractual rights and that international breaches by States are frequently
aimed at the destruction of those rights or the impact on the value of those rights”.?6”

As a fourth element, Burlington opposes Ecuador's contention that this claim is
barred as a consequence of Burlington’s so-called waiver of contract rights in this
arbitration. Burlington primarily advances the following arguments in support:

i. Ecuador confuses contract and treaty claims. Burlington seeks compensation
for these sums “as part of the value of its investment on the date of
expropriation”, not to pursue contractual indemnification.76

ii. Further, although it withdrew its right to pursue a claim under the PSCs,
Burlington did not waive the underlying right to be compensated for Law 42
payments. The Tribunal has already found that Burlington only waived the
possibility of re-filing its claims under the PSCs, but did not waive its underlying
rights, and can thus rely on them to pursue its treaty claims. This is confirmed
by Ecuadorian law: in his expert report, Dr. Pérez Loose explains that
Ecuadorian law distinguishes between substantive legal rights and “procedural
vehicles that convey those rights”, differentiating between (a) an underlying
substantive right, (b) a right of action, (c) a claim, and (d) a legal action.?”° The
withdrawal of a legal action or claim in no way destroys the substantive right.?”"
Furthermore, Ecuador’s position squares poorly with case law holding that an
investor cannot — even explicitly — waive its substantive treaty rights; it can only

waive its procedural rights.?’? Finally, it is undisputed that on 30 August 2009,
“the dispositive date for identifying the expropriated assets”, Burlington
possessed the contractual right to tax absorption.?”°

iii. Moreover, Burlington argues that the contract claims of the Burlington
Subsidiaries?“ were withdrawn as a result of the expropriation, since they had
become “superfluous”.?”° From then on, Burlington sought to recover the value
of its tax absorption rights forming part of its investment as part of its
expropriation case, rather than as a stand-alone claim for damages. The
withdrawal of Burlington’s contract claims is irrelevant for purposes of valuing
the expropriated investment because, “but for” the expropriation, Burlington
would not have waived its right to file the contract claim.?” Tribunals have
shown themselves to be reluctant to question strategic litigation decisions, and
properly so. Be this as it may, what matters here is that Burlington clarified in
written statements to the Tribunal and Ecuador that the withdrawal of its
contract claims was predicated on Ecuador's conduct.?”” Burlington emphasizes
that, “[hJaving agreed that the conclusion that led to Burlington’s withdrawal of
the claim was correct, namely that Burlington was faced with an unlawful
expropriation, the Tribunal cannot be asked to penalize Burlington through its
damages valuation for something that would not have occurred but for
Ecuador's unlawful conduct”.?”

iv. Finally, Burlington argues that it is in any event entitled to indemnity against the
effects of Law 42 arising after the withdrawal of its contract claims, since the
withdrawal could only apply to existing claims arising from Ecuador's pre-
withdrawal conduct, not to potential future claims arising from its post-
withdrawal conduct. That is, even if the Tribunal considered that the withdrawal

gave rise to some form of waiver of Burlington’s substantive rights (quod non), it
would still have to ignore the effects of Law 42 after the date of the withdrawal.
This is because a breach of Burlington’s contractual rights occurring after that
date would justify new claims by Burlington or any purchaser of the investment.
Burlington contends that it would make no sense to allow Ecuador to profit “from
future unlawful acts by erasing the future value of the tax absorption clauses
based on (at the very most) a waiver of claims for past breaches”.?”° For a
prospective buyer, the tax absorption clauses of the PSCs would include
“tremendous future value” irrespective of a withdrawal of any pre-existing
contract claims.?®° As noted above, Dr. Pérez Loose explains that Ecuadorian
law provides that a withdrawal of a legal action entails the loss of the right to
refile that same legal action, not future legal actions, and in any case does not
affect the underlying substantive rights, which continue to form part of the
assets.?8!

Fifth and last, Burlington denies that the contract rights that give rise to its claim
for past Law 42 dues are disputed, as Ecuador alleges. In its Decision on
Liability, the Tribunal determined the meaning of the tax absorption clauses and
that determination is binding: “So, the dispute, to the extent there was one, has
been resolved, and it's been resolved in Burlington’s favor”.?62

1.2 Ecuador’s position

Ecuador opposes Burlington’s claim for past Law 42 dues. Its primary submission is
that these are contract claims which Burlington now seeks to reintroduce through
the back door and over which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction. Alternatively, Ecuador
argues that this claim is inadmissible because it pertains to the vindication of
contract rights that are disputed by the Parties. In the further alternative, it submits
that this claim fails on the merits because (i) these are credits that do not form part
of the expropriated assets and are still held by the Contract Claimants,”®° and (ii) in
any event, the Contract Claimants have waived their entitlement to enforce their

contractual right for indemnification against Law 42 payments.

It is Ecuador's primary case that Burlington's claims related to Law 42 (including
Burlington's claim for its accrued right to receive reimbursement for payments made
under Law 42 or coactiva seizures) are contract claims and not treaty claims. As a
result, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over these claims.?&

As a general matter, Ecuador argues that all of Burlington’s claims related to Law 42
payments (whether past or future) are contractual in nature. Burlington attempts to
circumvent the Tribunal’s lack of jurisdiction by disguising these claims as treaty
claims, when in fact they rest entirely on the PSCs.”°5 For Ecuador, contract and
treaty claims have “different legal bases and give rise to separate legal analysis,
with distinct tests and applicable rules”, as recognized in case law and doctrine.
As confirmed in Pantechniki, the key to the distinction is the “normative source” from
which the different types of claims derive and the assessment whether a claim “truly
does have an autonomous existence outside the contract”.2°” Awards and scholarly
writings have confirmed that an objective test must be adopted, meaning that
tribunals are not bound by the parties’ characterization of the legal foundation of

Ecuador also raises the arguments summarized later in this section, in response to
Burlington’s submissions related to the future impact of Law 42 on its lost profits claim.

their claims.?8° Here, the legal foundation of Burlington’s Law 42 claims reveals that
they are contractual in nature.”°°

For Ecuador, Burlington is wrong to contend that its Law 42 claims are part of the
value of the investment at the time of the expropriation. These claims are identical to
its previous contract claims to enforce the tax renegotiation clauses in the PSCs, as
the Tribunal already found in its Decision on Jurisdiction (“this claim revolves around
a contract matter, not a ‘matter of taxation’”’).?°° They have the “same factual
predicates, the same legal basis, and seek the same relief” as the contract claims
put forward by Burlington’s Subsidiaries and as Burlington’s umbrella clause
claim.?°' Whereas the Subsidiaries withdrew their contract claims and the Tribunal
dismissed the umbrella clause claim, Burlington now seeks to reintroduce these
same claims through the back door. If the Tribunal puts Burlington in the pecuniary
position in which it would have been if the tax renegotiation had been performed, it
will in effect uphold a contract claim.?9?

As the Contract Claimants are no longer parties to the arbitration, the Tribunal has
no jurisdiction over Burlington's contract claims.?%° For Ecuador, these claims must
be dismissed because (i) contract claims cannot be entertained by the Tribunal if the
Parties to the proceedings are not also parties to the contract, (ii) the Tribunal
already held that Burlington may not rely on the umbrella clause to enforce its
Subsidiaries’ contract claims, and (ii) while the Tribunal considered disputed
contract rights as facts, it cannot take into consideration the value of those disputed

jurisdiction.”°> As Professor Stern acknowledged in her dissent in Occidental, there
is nothing unjust if Burlington is not entitled to compensation for contract claims due
to the limited jurisdiction of the Tribunal.?® If anything, granting Burlington's contract
claims would be “unfair and unjust”, since these claims were withdrawn with
prejudice at a time when Burlington was expected to file its response to Ecuador's
objections to jurisdiction (including jurisdiction over the contract claims).?9”

Alternatively, Ecuador submits that, even if the Tribunal deems the basis for
Burlington’s claim to be a treaty obligation, this claim is inadmissible because (i) it
“pertain[s] to the vindication of contract rights and (ii) there is a genuine dispute as
to the existence and scope of said rights”.*°* With respect to (i), Ecuador submits
that “a claim pertains to the vindication of contract rights when the claimant relies
upon contractual rights in the formulation of its investment treaty claim”,?°° which is
the case here. With respect to (ii), according to Ecuador, “there is undeniably a
genuine dispute between the Parties as to the existence and scope of Burlington’s
alleged contract rights purportedly affected by Law 42”,°°° as recognized in the
Decision on Liability.°°"

Ecuador asserts that where, as in the present case, “treaty claims pertain to the
vindication of genuinely disputed contractual rights, a tribunal constituted pursuant
to a treaty cannot examine such claims unless it has jurisdiction to rule on the
disputed contractual rights”.°° This is a well-established principle, “especially in
cases where the relevant contract contains a choice of forum clause”, which “applies

a fortiori where, as here, the parties to the contractual obligations in dispute are no
longer part of the proceedings. In both instances, the treaty tribunal lacks jurisdiction
to resolve the contractual dispute, which must be resolved by a different tribunal”.
While in most cases, the treaty tribunal can generally stay the proceedings and
await the determination by another tribunal mandated to determine the parties’
contract claims, this is not an option here because the contract claims are not
pending before any tribunal, nor can they ever be, since the possibility of refiling
these claims was waived with prejudice.°*

Faced with Burlington’s argument that the Tribunal has already resolved the dispute
between the Parties regarding these contract rights, Ecuador acknowledges that
“the Tribunal made some dicta in their [sic] Decision on Liability regarding the effect
of the renegotiation clauses, but we all know this very distinguished tribunal doesn’t
have jurisdiction over Contract Claims”. Ecuador contends that, as a result, “[t]here
cannot be any Decision, any adjudication whatsoever, in the Decision on Liability or
elsewhere on the Contract claims”, as a result of which these rights are still
disputed.°°>

In_a further alternative, in the event that the Tribunal were to hold that it has
jurisdiction over Burlington’s claim for Law 42 payments and that this claim is
admissible, Ecuador is of the view that the claim fails on its merits for two main

reasons.

First, the rights for which Burlington seeks compensation were never
expropriated.°°° Ecuador notes that, because the Tribunal dismissed its fair and
equitable treatment and umbrella clause claims and found that Law 42 was not an
expropriation, the Claimant effectively has no choice but to argue that Burlington
Oriente’s acquired right to tax absorption is part of the expropriated investment. This
argument fails because, as a matter of fact, Ecuador did not take these past contract
rights when it expropriated Burlington’s investment. The Tribunal deemed the
expropriation to have occurred on 30 August 2009 when Ecuador's physical
takeover of the Blocks became permanent. As a consequence, from that day
forward the PSCs could not be a source of profit for Burlington. In other words,

“[w]hat Ecuador took was the right to, in the future, explore and exploit the oilfields,
keep a share of the oil and sell it for its profit. It did not take any other asset of
Burlington Oriente”.°°” According to Ecuador, paragraphs 530° and 536°°° of the
Decision on Liability confirm that “the rights which had crystallized before Burlington
lost control of the Blocks [were] not affected by the takeover”.°"°

Ecuador emphasizes that it did not expropriate Burlington Oriente as a company
with all its assets; it only expropriated the PSCs. Burlington Oriente retained its other
assets, and in particular its credits.°'' This is confirmed by the fact that Burlington
has repeatedly stated in this arbitration that it still holds its contract rights.°1

Burlington’s argument that what was expropriated in this regard was a contractual
mechanism, as opposed to a simple debt, also fails. Burlington ignores that “when a
contract terminates, termination is not retroactive, and a court or an arbitral tribunal
can still apply its clauses to obligations that had appeared before termination”.°"> At
the time of the expropriation, Burlington had a right to specific performance of these
pre-existing contractual obligations and, as Ecuador refused to perform, it had a
right to damages to replace that specific performance. In Ecuador’s submission, this
right to damages stems from the non-performance of a contractual obligation that
predates the expropriation; “[e]xpropriation has nothing to do with it’.°"4

As a result, because Burlington’s right to be reimbursed for past Law 42 dues was
not expropriated, Burlington does not have a treaty claim for these rights; only a
contract claim over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction.°"5

The second reason why this claim must fail on the merits in Ecuador's opinion is that
it is a contract claim which Burlington has withdrawn and can thus no longer raise.
On 10 October 2009, the Burlington Subsidiaries withdrew “with prejudice” their
claims to recover Law 42 payments. The consequences of this withdrawal were
recorded in PO2, which noted that Burlington Oriente, Burlington Andean and
Burlington Ecuador ceased to be parties to this arbitration as of 6 November 2009
and that, consequently, the arbitration would deal solely with Burlington’s treaty
claims.%'®

Burlington is wrong to argue, says Ecuador, that it did not waive its underlying right
to be compensated. As the Tribunal determined, the Burlington Subsidiaries “waived
the possibility of ever re-filing their claims under the PSCs in any form”.3'7
Accordingly, the underlying rights are unenforceable and thus valueless. Ecuadorian
law confirms that a withdrawal of a claim with prejudice entails a waiver of the
underlying rights; Dr. Pérez Loose fails to cite a single decision to the contrary.°"®

Ecuador also opposes Burlington’s alternative argument that it is entitled to post-
withdrawal indemnity.*!° To the extent that this argument relates to pre-expropriation
tax debts, it is nonsensical. The Law 42 payments accrued before the withdrawal of
the claims and before the expropriation date determined by the Tribunal. The legal
foundation of these claims is still the alleged breach of the tax renegotiation clauses,
and therefore these claims are not new.°°

Ecuador further observes that the reasons why Burlington withdrew its contract
claims are irrelevant. It does not matter whether it did so as a result of the
expropriation, because the past dues were in any event not part of the expropriated
investment. Regardless of the reasons, “[t]he consequences of the withdrawal are

there. Burlington Oriente is not a party. Contract Claims have been withdrawn for
whatever good or bad reason, and the Tribunal cannot revive what is dead”.°?"

Ecuador appears to recognize that other tribunals have awarded the value of
accrued account receivables as compensation for expropriation. However, it argues
that “[n]one of the cases on which Burlington relies for the proposition that
compensation is due for expropriated contractual rights addresses the situation
where those contractual rights were waived by the claimant party.° It adds that,
unlike in the present case, in those cases the debts were in any event not
disputed.°7°

1.3 Analysis

At the outset, it is necessary to recall that the Tribunal has declined jurisdiction over
Burlington's umbrella clause and FET claims,°*4 that no contract claims are before
it,5*° and that it held that Law 42 and Ecuador's failure to absorb its effects did not
amount to an expropriation.°2° The only unlawful act identified in the Decision on
Liability was the expropriation of Burlington’s investment through Ecuador's
permanent physical takeover of the Blocks. As a result, the Tribunal’s task is
circumscribed to awarding damages “arising from and ascribable to”®2” that
takeover.

In carrying out this task, the Tribunal must proceed to the valuation of Burlington’s
expropriated investment, even if the valuation involves considering contract rights
which allegedly form part of the expropriated investment.%° Considering contract
rights in this context, the Tribunal does not exercise jurisdiction over the PSCs; it

Commentary 9 to Article 31 of the ILC Articles specifies that “it is only ‘[iJnjury ... caused by

from and ascribable to the wrongful act, rather than any and all consequences flowing from
an internationally wrongful act”.

values an expropriation claim over which there is no question that it has jurisdiction.
The Tribunal thus dismisses Ecuador’s jurisdictional objection.

The Tribunal likewise dismisses Ecuador's admissibility objection. In resolving
Burlington’s treaty claim, and in determining Ecuador’s liability under the Treaty, the
Tribunal made certain determinations regarding the content and scope of the rights
arising under the PSCs’ tax absorption clauses.**° The content and scope of these
contract rights are thus no longer in dispute for purposes of this phase of the
proceedings and the Tribunal relies on its assessment in the Decision on Liability to
the extent necessary in the present context.

That being said, the Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that Burlington’s claim fails on its
merits. The Tribunal can only award compensation for the damages caused by the
internationally wrongful act. Here, the internationally wrongful act was the
permanent physical takeover of the Blocks, which the Tribunal has held to constitute
an unlawful expropriation of Burlington’s investment. The consequence of that
physical takeover was that Burlington through its Subsidiaries lost the capacity to
operate the Blocks and thus to earn revenues under the PSCs. As stated in the
Decision on Liability:

“As a purely factual matter, Ecuador’s entry into and occupation of

Blocks 7 and 21 dispossessed Burlington of the oil fields. Such

dispossession deprived Burlington not only of its oil production share

— and thus of its revenues — but also of the means of production that

made those revenues possible. In a nutshell, the occupation of the

Blocks deprived Burlington of all the tangible property embodying its

investment in Ecuador. While Burlington still had its subsidiary’s rights

in the PSCs as well as the subsidiary’s shares, these rights and

shares had no value without possession of the oil fields and access to

the oil”.3%°
This can only mean that Ecuador’s physical takeover of the Blocks destroyed the
value of Burlington’s rights under the PSCs going forward, i.e., its possibility of
producing oil and obtaining revenues from oil sales in the future. The Decision on
Liability makes this clear when it states that ‘[ajs of this date [30 August 2009],
Ecuador deprived Burlington of the effective use and control of Blocks 7 and 21 ona

permanent basis, and thus expropriated its investment”.°*"

See, for instance: DoL, 9 334-335 (among others).
Id., 1530.
Id., 4 535 (emphasis added).

220.

By contrast, the physical takeover of the Blocks could not per se destroy the value of
Burlington's credits for the reimbursement of Law 42 dues that had accrued before
the date of expropriation. The Burlington Subsidiaries retained their right to demand
payment of these accrued credits. Had Ecuador expropriated the Burlington
Subsidiaries’ shares, the situation may have been different. And while the Tribunal
held that, as a result of the expropriation, the Burlington Subsidiaries’ rights in the
PSCs “had no value without possession of the oil fields and access to the oil”,°*? this
statement only applies as of 30 August 2009.

The fact that the Tribunal stated that Burlington’s right to tax absorption under the
PSCs was “part and parcel” of the value of its investment®*? and constituted “the
most valuable portion”** of that investment does not assist Burlington’s case. The
expropriation caused Burlington to lose this right from 30 August 2009 onwards; it
would not have prevented the Burlington Subsidiaries from exercising it with respect
to debts accrued before this date, if they had not waived their right to claim.

At the Hearing, Burlington raised a new argument, according to which its right to
past Law 42 dues is “not a simple accrued debt”, but a right to the application of a
“contractual adjustment that requires a contractual mechanism” that was taken
together with the PSCs.%°° Since it has lost the PSCs, so Burlington argues, it can
no longer request Ecuador to apply that contractual mechanism. The Tribunal
cannot agree. As Ecuador points out,°** the Burlington Subsidiaries’ right to specific
performance of that contractual mechanism became a right to claim compensation
for Ecuador's failure to perform, which survived the contract (otherwise no contract
claimant could ever claim damages on the basis of a terminated contract).

Burlington's additional arguments similarly fail. Although the Tribunal did state that
“by enacting Law 42 and then refusing to absorb its effect pursuant to the tax
absorption clauses, Ecuador has in effect nullified Burlington’s right to a correction
factor by preventing the exercise of this right”, and that “this nullification was made
possible through the use of Ecuador's sovereign powers”,°*” it ultimately held that
Ecuador's failure to absorb the effects of Law 42, be it at 50% or at 99%, did not

substantially deprive Burlington of its investment. It thus rejected Burlington’s
indirect expropriation claim based on Law 42 and Ecuador's contractual
breaches.*°°

Moreover, the Tribunal expressly rejected Burlington’s claim that Ecuador's
measures taken together constituted a creeping expropriation.**° Indeed, the
Tribunal found that “Burlington was not operating under conditions of substantial
deprivation before Ecuador physically occupied the Blocks”, “[nJor is it possible to
conclude that before that point Burlington had lost its ability to ‘make rational
decisions’”.3*"

Finally, in the circumstances described here, if the Tribunal were to grant
compensation for past Law 42 dues, it would give relief for Ecuador's failure to
comply with the PSC tax absorption clauses, when it has held that such non-
compliance was not an expropriation and it had no jurisdiction over other treaty
breaches and contract violations. In other words, it would grant relief for an act for
which it has ruled out liability or over which it lacks jurisdiction.

For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Burlington’s claim for its accrued rights
against Ecuador for the reimbursement of past Law 42 payments or coactiva
seizures is not a compensable loss under Burlington’s treaty claim.

That does not mean that Burlington (or rather, the Burlington Subsidiaries) may not
have a contract claim against Ecuador. However, as a result of the withdrawal of the
claims of the Burlington Subsidiaries, these companies are no longer parties to this

and § 457 (finding that “the effects of Law 42 at 99% were not tantamount to expropriation
and, accordingly, that Law 42 at 99% did not expropriate Burlington's investment’).

arbitration and the Tribunal cannot rule on their claims. This arbitration deals solely
with Burlington's treaty claims against Ecuador.°4?

2. Value of the operating assets (lost profits under the PSCs)
2.1 Burlington’s position

Burlington asserts that Ecuador must compensate it for profits lost “from the
production foregone”, which Burlington would have obtained under the PSCs absent
the expropriation, as valued on the date of the award. Burlington's financial expert,
Compass Lexecon, calls this head of damages “value of operating assets”, the
assets in question being the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21.

Burlington submits that “[iJnternational law requires that the State pay an amount of
damages representing the fair market value of the affected investment”, adding that
“[w]here (as here) the investment was a ‘going concern’ prior to the unlawful
expropriation, an assessment of fair market value must take future profitability into
consideration in order to provide full compensation”.*“°

Because Burlington values this head of damages on the date of the award, its lost
production can be broken down into two elements: (i) profits already lost, i.e., losses
to the date of the award, with interest applied to actualize the cash flows to present
value, and (ii) future lost profits, i.e., losses from the date of the award until the
expiry of the PSCs, discounted to present value.*“4

Using the discounted cash flow (DCF) method and Compass Lexecon’s
assumptions, in the Updated Model these lost profits are quantified at
USD 840.9 million as of 31 August 2016 (the date used as a proxy for the date of
the award), including pre-award interest. Relying on the full reparation principle,
Compass Lexecon has ignored the economic effects of Law 42 when making this
quantification.

2.2 Ecuador’s position

Ecuador acknowledges that “in accordance with international law, compensation
should correspond to the fair market value (“FMV”) of Burlington’s purportedly
expropriated investment” and that, “[i]Jn the context of going concerns, the tribunal

Mem., 9 53, 55.
Id., | 74. See: paragraph 287 below.

84

230.

231.

232.

will look to the investment’s “earning capacity during the remainder of its life for
assessing its ‘market value’”.°45

More specifically, Ecuador accepts that the expropriated assets in this case consist
of Burlington’s rights to operate Blocks 7 and 21 under the PSCs, and that
Burlington is entitled to the FMV of these rights as reflected in the profits that
Burlington would have earned under those contracts.5“° Ecuador does not contest
that the value of Burlington’s expropriated investment should be quantified by
reference to the contract rights indirectly held by Burlington through its Subsidiaries.
As discussed in more detail below, Ecuador also agrees that a DCF analysis is the
appropriate valuation method.%47

By contrast, Ecuador submits that Burlington’s valuation of these lost profits is
grossly inflated, mainly because Burlington misapplies the relevant standards of
compensation, uses the wrong valuation date, bases its calculation on incorrect
assumptions (in particular, it fails to account for Law 42 taxes when projecting future
profits), and applies an exaggerated interest rate. According to Ecuador's expert,
Fair Links, the FMV of the PSCs, valued on the date of the expropriation, is USD
26.3 million. Because Ecuador values the investment on the date of the
expropriation, the Tribunal notes that its valuation is composed solely of projected
future profits discounted back to the date of the expropriation.

2.3 Analysis

There is common ground that the value of Burlington’s investment should be
quantified by reference to the profit-making capacity of the PSCs (which Burlington
indirectly held through its Subsidiaries)*“* as of the date of expropriation and for the
remainder of their term. As stated in the Decision on Liability,5*? Ecuador's physical
takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 deprived Burlington of the possibility to earn future

CM, 44 8, 327, citing: Middle East Cement v. Egypt, § 127 (Exh. CL-271).

See, for instance: CM 4 8, 324-327; Rejoinder, § 454. Ecuador clarifies that it does not
agree that the FMV is “simply a proxy for the lost future cash flows”, since under certain
circumstances, “lost future cash flows operate as a proxy for FMV”, and Dr. Abdala now
admitted to have calculated the value of future cash flows, not the FMV of Burlington’s
investment. Rejoinder, § 455.

See: Section VII.D.2.2 below.

The Tribunal recalls that Article |(1)(a) of the Treaty provides that “investment” means “every
kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by
nationals or companies of the other Party”, and includes “any right conferred by law or
contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law” (Emphasis added).

revenues under the PSCs. The Tribunal further held that Ecuador’s physical
takeover of Blocks 7 and 21 became permanent on 30 August 2009.%°° As a result,
“[als of this date, Ecuador deprived Burlington of the effective use and control of
Blocks 7 and 21 on a permanent basis, and thus expropriated its investment”.5" In
other words, the physical takeover of the Blocks deprived Burlington of the
possibility of obtaining future revenues from the PSCs from 30 August 2009
onwards. On this basis, the Tribunal considers that Burlington’s lost profits claim
from 30 August 2009 onwards is a compensable loss.

It is undisputed that Burlington seeks to recover the value of its own investment,
represented by its share in the Consortium’s revenues, and not the entire value of
the Consortium’s investment. Compass Lexecon makes this clear when it states that
it “[i]In order to compute the damages incurred by Burlington, | apply its equity
participation in each of the Blocks: 42.5% in Block 7 and 46.25% in Block 21 (since
October 2006)”.2°* Ecuador acknowledges this.°** As a result, no risk of double
recovery by Burlington and Perenco (who has initiated its own claim) would arise
from an award from this Tribunal on this head of claim.

The Tribunal will address Ecuador's objections to the valuation of this claim in
Section C below.

3. Lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC
3.1 Burlington’s position

Burlington argues that Ecuador's “unlawful conduct” deprived Burlington of the
opportunity to negotiate in good faith an extension of the Block 7 PSC, and Ecuador
must compensate for that loss of opportunity.*5* According to the Chorzéw standard
of full reparation, damages include all the profits that Burlington would have
obtained absent the unlawful activity, which destroyed the opportunity to negotiate a

Id., 1535.

Ecuador notes in particular that “[iJt It is not in dispute that Burlington’s free cash flows,
assuming no Law 42, result from deducting from the Consortium’s gross revenues (i) the
State’s participation (i.e., share of production), (ii) the operating costs (OPEX) and capital
expenditures (CAPEX), (iii) Perenco’s share of the Blocks’ revenues (53.75% of Block 21
and 57.5% of Block 7), and (iv) Burlington’s income tax and labor participation” (R-PHB, 4
345).

contract extension.°°° Burlington submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this
claim (Section 3.1.1), that in the “but for’ world, Burlington would have enjoyed a
right to negotiate the extension of the Block 7 PSC (Section 3.1.2), and that
Burlington would “in all probability” have obtained an eight-year extension under
revised contractual terms (Section 3.1.3).

3.1.1. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over this claim

Contrary to Ecuador’s contention, Burlington submits that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction to compensate the lost opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC.*°° In the
Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that the investment must be assessed “as a
whole” and the value of the lost opportunity to negotiate the extension is part of the
value of the PSC that was taken. The claim for the value of the Block 7 extension is
thus a treaty, not a contract claim. Burlington’s submission is not that Ecuador
“breached an agreement for a contract extension”, but that Burlington was deprived
“of the valuable opportunity to seek an extension”.**’ In other words, Burlington does
not claim the breach of a contractually agreed extension, but for the economic value
of the right to negotiate such an extension, which, it argues, would probably have
been agreed but for Ecuador's unlawful conduct. Ecuador's argument that
Burlington may not raise this claim because it was not a party to the PSC and
because its Subsidiaries have withdrawn their contract claims fails for the same
reasons.3%

According to Burlington, the argument that it brings a new treaty claim for lost
opportunity without having given Ecuador notice under Article VI of the BIT is
equally ill-founded. The term “investment” is defined broadly under the BIT. It
includes “any right conferred by law or contract”, which encompasses Clause 6.2 of
the PSC providing the right to an extension.** Therefore, Burlington's existing treaty
claim covers Burlington’s lost opportunity to negotiate an extension of the Block 7
PSC.

Burlington also submits that, in the “but for” world, it would have enjoyed a right to
negotiate the extension of the Block 7 PSC (Section 3.1.2),5° and would ‘in all
probability” have obtained an eight-year extension under revised contractual terms
(Section 3.1.3).°*' Burlington further argues that tribunals have recognized the
importance of lost opportunities in the valuation of an investment (Section 3.1.4).°°2

In support of its claim, Burlington relies on Mr. Moyes’ expert report, which explains
the terms on which Burlington would “in all probability” have obtained a contract
extension in a context of good faith negotiations as mandated under the PSCs and
Ecuadorian law.

3.1.2 In the “but for” world, Burlington would have enjoyed a
right to negotiate the extension of the Block 7 PSC

According to Burlington, Article 6.2 of the Block 7 PSC sets out the conditions for a
“mandatory negotiation concerning an extension”. Under that provision, the contract
term may be extended in four situations: (a) if and when it is in the State’s best
interests, (b) if the production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon
infrastructures, (c) if the contractor proposes significant new investments during the
last five years of the contract, or (d) if new deposits are discovered as an exclusive
result of new exploration.

In addition, Article 1562 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code establishes the general duty to
perform all contracts in good faith. Hence, once the Consortium satisfied any of
the conditions set forth in Article 6.2, Ecuador was under a duty to negotiate an
extension in good faith.°

Burlington alleges that the Consortium would have met at least three of the four
alternative conditions.**° First, as Mr. Moyes explains, it would undoubtedly have
been in Ecuador's best interests to extend the Block 7 PSC.°°” Ecuador is wrong to

argue that it has the discretionary power under Clause 6.2 to grant an extension or
not. Dr. Pérez Loose clarified that Ecuador's public administration was under a duty
to protect Burlington’s “legitimate expectation” and Ecuadorian law recognizes
compensation for lost opportunities.°°* Fair Links’ suggestion that Petroamazonas
had the capacity to operate the Blocks directly misses the point, says Burlington.
The fact that Ecuador entered into contracts with seven private consortia between
2010 and 2012 demonstrates that Ecuador itself considered that its interests were
best served by having its oilfields operated by third parties.°°

Second, Burlington and its Consortium partner unquestionably proposed and made
significant investments during the last five years of production (at least until October
2007 when Decree 662 was imposed). Burlington invested USD 213 million
between 2005 and 2007 “yielding substantial increases in production”.°”°

Mr. Crick confirms that, absent Law 42, the Consortium would have made larger
investments well beyond 2007, which would have supported the Consortium’s
extension rights.9”' On this topic, Mr. Martinez explains that the abandonment of the
Consortium’s investment program not only decreased the value of the investment
but also prejudiced the exercise of the Consortium’s extension right.5”? He further
testified as follows:

“The extension right could be triggered by Burlington Oriente making

new investments to increase production, which, before the

introduction of Ecuador’s measures, Burlington Oriente fully expected

to do”.9”8
Burlington explains that its decision to stop investing in Block 7 in December 2007
“says nothing about what [it] would have done in the absence” of Law 42.°”%
Furthermore, as Mr. Martinez stated, even if Burlington “may have been interested
in selling, or attempted to sell” the Blocks in 2006 and 2007 this does not preclude

that it had “an even greater incentive to maintain the value of the Blocks”.°”° As an
example, Mr. Moyes highlighted that the negotiation of an extension of Murphy Oil's
contract for Block 16 “increased Block 16’s value even though the terms of the new
service contract were speculative and had yet to be negotiated”.°”°

Moreover, contrary to Ecuador's contentions, “internal ConocoPhillips documents
prove that Burlington was indeed interested in seeking an extension”.°”” The 2007
Sales Memorandum expressly stated that “an extension is possible, especially with
a commitment to enhance the productivity of the field beyond the continuation of a
standard drilling program”, and noted that “[iJt is thought that any new field
discovered will receive an automatic term extension to 2017”.978 In turn, the 2007
Budget Presentation noted that “10 years of extension seems to be a reasonable
target”.9”9

Finally, Burlington contends that its refusal to accept the transitory agreement
negotiated between Ecuador and Perenco*®° was legitimate, as (i) this agreement
did not protect Burlington’s rights under the existing PSCs, and (ii) the terms of the
Ley de Equidad Tributaria were not the only possible outcome. Mr. Moyes’ evidence
shows that, beyond a short transitory period, not a single extension signed by
Ecuador was subject to its terms.°*"

Third, according to Burlington, the Consortium’s operations likewise led to the
discovery of extensive new deposits.*®* In support, Burlington relies on Mr. Crick,
who explains that this was particularly so regarding the Oso reservoir, where the
Consortium’s drilling program revealed significantly larger reserves than initially
thought, for instance when discovering that the reservoir formed part of the Frontino
field.*°° For Burlington, these “extensive discoveries in Block 7 were the exclusive
result of the Consortium’s operations” since no other entity operated in the Block.

The estimated reserves grew from an initial 33.5 million barrels in 2004 to 70 million
barrels in 2006, namely an increase of over 100%.384

Burlington adds that, contrary to Ecuador's assertions, the Consortium did carry out
the required exploratory activities in Oso.*® The 2006 Oso Development Plan
“resulted exclusively from the Consortium’s new exploration activities” leading to the
discovery and development of the north Oso field, which was sufficient to “trigger”
the extension under Article 6.2, as Mr. Moyes confirms.%°°

3.1.3. Burlington would “in all probability” have obtained an
eight-year extension under revised contractual terms
Burlington is of the view that it would “in all probability” have obtained an eight-year
extension of the Block 7 PSC, although it acknowledges that it would have had to
accept revised contract terms.°°” According to Mr. Moyes, assuming good faith on
both sides, contractual negotiations for an extension would most likely have resulted
in a revised contract with the following characteristics: (a) a service contract with a
fixed fee per barrel, (b) and a service fee of USD 35 per barrel, adjusted for inflation,
for existing wells, and a fee yielding 25% return on investment for new or
incremental production, (c) for a duration of eight years.°%

It is Burlington’s submission that, had Ecuador complied with its contractual
obligation to absorb the tax and acted as a reasonable contract partner, the
Consortium would have accepted such revised terms, as Mr. Martinez confirmed.*®°
In Mr. Moyes’ expert opinion, these terms would also have been acceptable to
Ecuador, since they compare to those achieved in Blocks 10 (Agip) and 16
(Repsol).°° They would also have been in line with President Correa’s new “single
model” contract form.°*"

3.1.4 Tribunals have recognized the importance of lost
opportunities in the valuation of an investment
According to Burlington, tribunals recognize that the lost opportunity to earn future
profits is a recoverable loss and that “the prospect for renewal of an authorization to
do business is an asset with a value of its own” and thus an important element of a
going concern.°*? Examples include Sapphire Petroleum, SPP v. Egypt, and CME v.
Czech Republic. For Burlington, these cases show that “an investment’s future
prospects, whether dependent on a contract or license, are central to its value”.°% In
Sapphire Petroleum, the arbitrator awarded compensation for lost opportunity to
generate profit from the concession although operations were in an early stage and
no oil had yet been discovered.°™ The arbitrator found it clear that the plaintiff had
lost an opportunity to discover oil, which he regarded to be “very favourable”.°°> He
further held that, where damage cannot be proven, it is enough “to be able to admit
with sufficient probability the existence and extent of the damage”.*° In SPP, the
tribunal considered the lost opportunity of making a commercial success of the
project.°%” In CME, the tribunal applied the “but for” scenario assuming that the
broadcast license would have been renewed “in all likelihood”, and considered the
“reasonable probability of license renewal” when valuing the investment.°% In the
present circumstances, the situation is much simpler, says Burlington, since Block 7
was already “highly productive” at the time of expropriation “and remains so to this
day”.°%° By contrast, Gemplus, upon which Ecuador relies, must be distinguished

from the present case given that Burlington produced “extensive evidence” proving
the “strong likelihood” of receiving a contract extension.4°°

Finally, Burlington opposes Ecuador's contention that lost opportunity damages are
speculative.*°' According to Burlington, customary international law, as SPP shows,
does not require Burlington to prove its lost opportunity damages “with complete
certainty”, but with “sufficient probability’.4°? This is especially so where the
uncertainty derives from Ecuador’s unlawful conduct. This latter test is “more than
satisfied”, since, absent Law 42, an extension was “reasonably certain”.

Accordingly, Burlington submits that the Tribunal “can and should fairly value” the
lost opportunity at USD 300.5 million in the extension scenario.*% In the Updated
Model, assuming a valuation on 31 August 2016, the value of this claim was
updated to USD 376 million, including pre-award interest.

3.2 Ecuador’s position

Ecuador opposes Burlington’s lost opportunity claim with respect to the extension of
the Block 7 PSC. First, Ecuador argues that this is a contract claim over which the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction (Section 3.2.1). Alternatively, Ecuador submits that the
claim is inadmissible or fails on the merits (Section 3.2.2).

3.2.1 Burlington’s lost opportunity claim is a contract claim
over which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
It is Ecuador's primary submission that Burlington’s lost opportunity claim is
contractual in nature, as a result of which the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction.**
Ecuador's arguments regarding contract claims set out in Section VII.C.1.2 above
apply mutatis mutandis to the present claim.

More specifically, Ecuador argues that Burlington’s self-serving argument that the
negotiation of a contract extension is part of the value of its investment is
“insufficient” to support the existence of a treaty claim. By resorting to the broad

definition of the term investment, Burlington attempts to introduce a contract claim
through the back door. If the Tribunal applies an objective test, it will recognize that
the claim is based on the PSCs. This is clear if one considers that the claim is based
on the alleged breach of the tax renegotiation clauses.“

3.2.2 In the alternative, Burlington’s claim is inadmissible or
fails on the merits
Alternatively, if the Tribunal were to hold that Burlington’s claim is based on a treaty
obligation, this claim would be inadmissible, because “(i) Burlington's claims pertain
to the vindication of contract rights and (ii) there is a genuine dispute as to the
existence and scope of said rights”.*°° Ecuador's specific arguments in this respect
are set out in Section VII.C.1.2 above.

If the Tribunal does not reject the claim for lack of jurisdiction or inadmissibility,
Ecuador submits that it must dismiss it on the merits. According to Ecuador, this
claim is nothing more than an attempt by Burlington to create damages “where none
exist”.“°” Mr. Moyes is not an expert on the Ecuadorian oil sector, as a consequence
of which his opinion is irrelevant. This is especially true of his speculations with
respect to the buy-out of Murphy Oil's interest in Block 16 and his
misrepresentations regarding the context of the negotiations of the contracts to
which he refers.*°® Nor is Dr. Pérez Loose’s opinion of any support for Burlington's
imaginary claim, which artificially inflates its damages claim by “a staggering USD
300.5 million (of which USD 135.6 million is interest)”.4°°

For Ecuador, this claim must be dismissed for three reasons: (i) Ecuador had full
discretion to grant an extension or not, (ii) Burlington is solely responsible for having
foregone the opportunity to continue operations, and (iii) no willing buyer would have
attributed any value to the remote and uncertain alleged opportunity.

First, Ecuador asserts that it holds discretionary power under Article 6.2 of the Block
7 PSC to decide ‘if and when” it is in its best interests to grant an extension.*'°

Id., 4.343.

Id., § 370. Ecuador advances this argument for all claims related to Law 42, as well as for
the claim for lost opportunity to extend Block 7.

Burlington had no vested right, not even a legitimate expectation to a contract
extension.*’ To wit, Article 6.2 provides that the contract term “podra ser
prorrogable, siempre y cuando convenga a los intereses del Estado”.*'? This
language unequivocally shows the State’s discretionary power. It does not create an
“entitlement” to an extension, as Burlington argues.*'? Prof. Aguilar, Ecuador's legal
expert, opined that the use of the words “podra ser’ indicates that Ecuador was
under no obligation to grant an extension, and that it had the authority to determine
if and when a contract extension was in the State’s best interest." Even if there is
an obligation to negotiate (in French, an obligation de moyens), there is no
obligation to achieve a specific result (in French, an obligation de résultat).*"®

In any event, Ecuador asserts that Burlington failed to meet the technical
requirements under Article 6.2 to qualify for a potential extension. But even if it had,
it would still be irrelevant in light of the discretionary power of the State. Beyond
economic considerations, Ecuador would have considered the following aspects
before accepting an extension: the imposition of the single service contract model,
Burlington's sabotage of the negotiations with Perenco, the fact that Burlington had
stopped investing in Ecuador since December 2007, and Burlington's intention to
sell its Ecuadorian assets.‘® These facts would have led Ecuador to conclude that
an extension was not in its best interest.‘"”

In its Rejoinder, Ecuador notes that Burlington has abandoned its prior argument
that it qualified for an extension based on significant investments. Instead, it now
limits itself to arguing that it allegedly discovered new oil deposits." However,
notes Ecuador, Burlington failed to rebut its argument that every new oil discovery
gives rise to the application of a specific economic regime under Article 8.1.1 of the
Block 7 PSC for purposes of allocation of produced oil. Yet, the alleged Oso field

Dr. Pérez Loose translates this as “this term may be extended, if and when it is in the best
interests of the State [...]”. (Pérez Loose ER (English translation), § 159). Ecuador provides
a virtually identical translation of this language (“this term may be extended, if and when it is
in the State’s best interest [...]”. CM, § 230, note 213).

266.

discoveries “remained subject to the same economic regime” as the rest of Block 7,
indicating that Burlington itself did not truly believe to have made a new discovery.*'°

As a second substantive reason for the Tribunal to refuse to award damages
concerning the potential extension of the Block 7 PSC, Ecuador submits that
Burlington’s claim fails for lack of causation, since Burlington’s alleged loss was not
and could not have been caused by Ecuador. It was Burlington's strategic decision
to leave Ecuador and to torpedo the negotiation process that led to its alleged
losses. Indeed, Burlington admitted that it preferred to proceed with its “asset
divestment strategy”.“2° Ecuador engaged in negotiations with Perenco, which
remained open, but Burlington prevented Perenco from agreeing to “fairer
contractual terms”.**' In fact, Burlington was never interested in reaching an
agreement and even threatened legal action against Perenco. Accordingly, for
Ecuador, Burlington is solely responsible for having foregone the opportunity to
negotiate an extension of its operations.

According to Ecuador, this failure to prove causation is fatal to Burlington’s claim, as
only damages caused by an internationally wrongful act are subject to compensation
in international law. Burlington’s “abusive mention of purported unlawful actions, in
the plural” must not be entertained, in light of the Tribunal’s finding that the only
internationally wrongful act in this case was Ecuador’s failure to pay
compensation. 422

Ecuador's third argument is that no willing buyer would have attributed a value to the
alleged lost opportunity in light of its uncertainty and remoteness.‘ Burlington's
own test of “reasonable certainty” and “sufficient probability” leads to the conclusion
that its claim must fail. Burlington cannot even show that it sought the negotiation of
an extension, and the ConocoPhillips sale documents show that the intent was to
sell the group’s interests in Ecuador in any event. Moreover, the true reason for
Burlington's decision to stop investing in the Blocks was the poor quality of the
reservoirs and the ‘imminent expiry” of the Block 7 PSC, not Law 42.44 For

Ecuador, it cannot have been Law 42, since contemporaneous documentation
shows that the Oso field was still profitable in October 2007 and the Consortium
considered drilling new wells even under Law 42 at 99%.*5

Unlike the present case, damages were granted for lost opportunity in CME because
there was a “high degree of certainty, supported by the practice in the television
broadcasting industry” that the investor's license would be extended.“”° In addition,
Mr. Moyes’ opinion that the Consortium would have obtained an extension in light of
seven other extensions granted by Ecuador is misconceived; no participation
contract was extended. All the examples cited by Mr. Moyes relate to renegotiated
and amended contracts which were to migrate to the service contract model.
Furthermore, the service contracts agreed with Eni/Agip and Repsol cannot be used
as reference here as the contracts are not comparable. Repsol reached an
agreement during the transitory period in 2008, when Burlington insisted on blocking

a similar agreement.

Finally, Mr. Moyes’ analysis of the “likely terms” of a renegotiated contract is based
on his personal considerations, and he failed to show that Ecuador's position on the
relevance of such “likely terms” is wrong.‘?”

3.3. Analysis

Through its lost opportunity claim, Burlington is in effect asking the Tribunal to find
that its profit stream under the Block 7 PSC would have continued for an additional
eight years after the expiry of the then-existing contract term, albeit on different
terms.‘° It can thus be understood as expanding the production profile under which
Burlington values the Block 7 PSC, with some modifications. In this context,

Relying on Mr. Moyes’ testimony, Compass Lexecon projects the Block 7 PSC’s profit
stream from 16 August 2010 to 16 August 2018 based on a service contract where the
Consortium receives (i) “[a] service fee of US$ 35 per gross barrel produced from all wells
that Claimant would have drilled absent the extension, partially adjusted for inflation”; and (ii)
“[a] service fee for incremental investments (i.e., new wells and associated facilities that are
only to be drilled under the extension scenario) which would allow the Consortium to achieve
a 25% return on such incremental investments”. Compass Lexecon ER1, § 56.

although this claim (like all the other claims of Burlington) is linked to the PSCs, the
Tribunal considers that it is in essence a claim for damages caused by the
expropriation, that is, a treaty claim over which the Tribunal indeed has jurisdiction.

Ecuador nonetheless invokes the inadmissibility of this claim. The Tribunal has
already examined this objection with respect to Burlington’s claim for past Law 42
dues (see paragraph 214 above), to which discussion it refers. As a result, it holds
that this claim is admissible.

In the further alternative, Ecuador is of the view that this claim fails on its merits. The
Tribunal agrees. Under the clear and unambiguous terms of Article 6.2 of the Block
7 PSC, Burlington did not have an entitlement to a contract extension that could
have been taken or destroyed as a result of Ecuador’s expropriation. All that it had,
and all that it lost, was a right to negotiate such an extension. Its claim for profits
allegedly lost as a result of this loss of its right to negotiate a contract extension fails
for the reasons explained below.

It is evident from the wording of Article 6.2 that Ecuador had full discretion to allow
an extension of the Block 7 PSC or not, even under a new service contract model.
Article 6.2 reads as follows:

“El Periodo de Explotacién durara en el presente caso, hasta el
dieciséis de agosto de dos mil diez; este plazo podra ser prorrogable,
siempre y cuando convenga a los intereses del Estado por las
siguientes causas: Cuando el area de explotacidn se encuentre
alejada de la infraestructura hidrocarburifera petrolera existente,
previa aprobaci6n del Ministerio del Ramo y por un periodo de hasta
cinco (5) afios. Cuando la Contratista proponga nuevas inversiones
significativas en los ultimos cinco (5) afos del Periodo de
Explotaci6n, previa aceptacién del Ministerio del Ramo y aprobacién
del CEL, siempre y cuando requieran plazos adecuados de
amortizacion para dichas inversiones. Para el caso de eventuales
descubrimientos de nuevos Yacimientos de  Hidrocarburos
Comercialmente Explotables provenientes exclusivamente de
trabajos de nueva exploracién que realizare la Contratista, el plazo
de Periodo de Explotacién se prorrogara previa aceptacién del
Ministerio del Ramo y aprobacién del CEL”.4°

Exh. C-1. Burlington provides the following [unofficial] translation (Mem., § 116): “In this
case, the Production Period will last until August sixteenth (16), two thousand ten (2010); this
term may be extended, if and when it is in the State’s best interest, or for the following
reasons:

e When the Production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon production
infrastructure, with the prior approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and for a
period of up to five (5) years;

98

273.

274.

275.

As Prof. Aguilar opines, this clause contains three rules that must be analyzed
separately: (i) first, the contractual term may be extended; (ii) second, the extension
will only be granted if it is in the State’s interests, and, additionally, (iii) at least one
of three requirements must be met.*°

With respect to (i), it appears from the use of the verb “podra’ (“may”) that this
provision grants the State discretion to grant the extension or not. If the extension
had been mandatory, the provision would have used the verb “deberd’ (“shall”) or
the future imperative tense “se prorrogarda’ (“shall or will be extended”). The Tribunal
further notes that the provision states that the contract “podra ser prorrogable’,
which strictly speaking should be translated as “may be subject to an extension”, or
“may be extendable”, instead of “podraé ser prorrogado”, meaning “may be
extended”. The use of two terms that indicate possibility rather than certainty
(“podra” and “prorrogable’) confirms the opinion of the Tribunal that this was a
discretionary power.**' This does not mean that the State had unfettered discretion.
The State’s discretion must be exercised reasonably and the PSCs imposed further
limits, as described below.

Second, the extension may be granted “siempre y cuando” (if and when) it is in the
State’s interests. The determination of what are the State’s best interests can only
rest with the State itself, which strengthens the discretionary nature of this

years of the Production Period, with the agreement of the Ministry of Energy and
Mines and the approval of the [Special Bid Committee], if and when adequate
amortization periods are required for those investments;

«If new Commercial Hydrocarbon Deposits are discovered as an exclusive result of
new exploration work performed by the Contractor, the Production Period will be
extended with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the
approval of the [Special Bid Committee]” (emphasis added by the Tribunal).

In turn, Ecuador provides the following unofficial translation (CM, § 230, note 213): “In this
case, the Production Period will last until August sixteenth (16), two thousand ten (2010); this
term may be extended, if and when it is in the State’s best interest for the following reasons:
When the Production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon production infrastructure,
with the prior approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and for a period of up to five (5)
years; When the Contractor proposes significant new investments during the last five (5)
years of the Production Period, with the agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and
the approval of the CEL, if and when adequate amortization periods are required for those
investments; If new Commercial Hydrocarbon Deposits are discovered as an exclusive result
of new exploration work performed by the Contractor, the Production Period will be extended
with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of the CEL”).

The Tribunal prefers Ecuador's translation, which does not contain the emphasized “or” in
first sentence, and which does not exist in the Spanish original.

extension. As Prof. Aguilar explains, the interests of the State are not merely
economic; they are also social and political.“? Even if Burlington could prove that
the Block 7 extension would have been economically rational for Ecuador (a
question of fact that the Tribunal need not address), it cannot be presumed that the
extension would necessarily have been in the State’s interests.

Finally, under Article 6.2 of the Block 7 PSC, the extension may only be granted in
one or more of the following three scenarios:

“When the Production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon production
infrastructure, with the prior approval of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and
for a period of up to five (5) years”;

ii. “When the Contractor proposes significant new investments during the last five
(5) years of the Production Period, with the agreement of the Ministry of Energy
and Mines and the approval of the CEL, if and when adequate amortization
periods are required for those investments”;

iii. “If new Commercial Hydrocarbon Deposits are discovered as an exclusive
result of new exploration work performed by the Contractor, the Production
Period will be extended with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and
Mines and the approval of the CEL”.*%°

In each of these three scenarios, the consent of the State is required. None gives
rise to an “automatic” extension. In addition to the discretion of the State just
referred to, the extension is subject to the “prior approval of the Ministry” and in the
last two scenarios also to the “approval of the CEL”. It is true that the third scenario
uses more imperative language (“se prorrogara’, or “shall be extended”), but that is
only if the prior approval of the State is obtained. While Mr. Moyes might possibly be
right that in the ordinary course of business an extension would likely have been
agreed on service contract terms acceptable to Ecuador and Burlington (that

Id., § 73 (“[W]hen we are dealing with the public interest, which is the one assessed the
moment a discretional power is exercised, judgments do not respond solely and necessarily
to economic rationality, which is doubtless very important in Private Law. Public interest
consults not only this rationality, but also social rationality and political rationality, which the
administrative authority is required to consider to satisfy collective interests and the common
good”) (translation by the Tribunal).

Burlington refused it in the actual circumstances is not determinative), it nonetheless
remains that any extension was subject to the consent of the State.

The Tribunal thus finds that, even if Burlington had met any of the three conditions
listed above (a factual inquiry in which, for reasons of procedural efficiency, the
Tribunal does not engage), Burlington would not have been entitled to an extension
of the Block 7 PSC. In other words, as noted above, Burlington did not have a right
to a contractual extension that could have been either taken or destroyed as a result
of Ecuador’s expropriation. At most, Burlington had a right to negotiate a contract
extension — in its words, a right to a “mandatory negotiation concerning an
extension” (see paragraph 240 above). In the Tribunal’s view, Burlington has not
proven, with the reasonable certainty that international law requires for a lost profits
claim, that an extension capable of being “taken” would in fact have materialized
from its right to negotiate. As noted in Merrill Ring, “the state cannot guarantee a
profit which is no more than an expectation on the drawing board and which may or
may not be realized”.“° Thus, as in Gemplus,*° when valuing Burlington’s lost
profits under the Block 7 PSC, the Tribunal will project lost profits until the expiry of
the term Block 7 PSC on 31 August 2010 and not beyond.

Article 36 of the ILC Articles provides that “compensation shall cover any financially
assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is established”. Tribunals have
consistently found that lost profits may only be awarded if there is sufficient or reasonable
certainty that they would have materialized. See, for instance: Asian Agricultural Products
Ltd v Republic of Sri Lanka (ICSID Case No ARB/87/3) (“AAPL v. Sri Lanka”), Award of 27
June 1990, § 104 (Exh. CL-113), Micula v. Romania, Award of 11 December 2013, {J 1006-

Law 61 (2004), p. 111.

Concession Agreement was ten years, commencing on 15 September 1999 and expiring on
14 September 2009 [...]. There was a possible extension thereafter of not more than ten
more years, subject (inter alia) to the discretion of the Secretariat. Whilst the exercise of that
discretion was not unfettered under Mexican law, the Tribunal considers that the Claimants’
claim for this second period of ten years is far too contingent, uncertain and unproven,
lacking any sufficient factual basis for the assessment of compensation under the two BITs.
At the relevant date, the Concessionaire had no legal right to any extension of the
Concession’s original ten-year term; and as the Concessionaire’s minority shareholders, the
Claimants’ rights as investors under the BITs were still more nebulous and speculative.
Accordingly, the Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the Concession Agreement would not
have continued beyond 14 September 2009, i.e. 8.25 years after the Requisition of 25 June
2001; and the Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ claims based upon any period thereafter”).

The Tribunal appreciates that, even if Burlington did not have a right to a contract
extension, it may have had an opportunity to extend the contract that could
potentially have value. Tribunals have recognized that the loss of a business
opportunity (or “loss of a chance”) may give rise to compensation.*?” That is not
equivalent to the lost profits that the opportunity, had it materialized, would have
been generated. Indeed, there is a possibility that the chance may not have
materialized. That element of uncertainty must be built into the claim.*°° As counsel
for Burlington put it in a legal publication:

“A loss of opportunity (or chance) is a sub-category of lost profits
where not only the magnitude but even the existence of monetary
prejudice is doubtful. Ordinarily, this would be viewed as a matter of
speculation and therefore not lead to recovery at all. What
distinguishes this category of damages and rescues the claimant's
prospects for recovery is that the possibility of profits itself has a
value. The paradigm case is Sapphire, which involved the
cancellation of rights to explore and exploit any hydrocarbon
resources found in a specific area. At the time of the breach, there
was no way of knowing whether there would be any discovery of
commercial value. Yet the chance itself had a value; a third party
would have paid something for the licensee’s rights”.*°°

Here, while Burlington and its legal expert appear to accept that this claim is for the
loss of an opportunity,““° Burlington has not quantified the value of that

See, for instance: Sapphire v. NIOC, Award of 15 March 1963, p. 187-188; SPP v. Egypt,
Award of 20 May 1990, 4§ 214-216; and Gemplus v. Mexico, Award of 16 June 2010, 4
13.98 (“In the Tribunal’s view, there was therefore as at 24 June 2001 no certainty or realistic
expectation of this project's profitability as originally envisaged, but there was nonetheless a
reasonable opportunity. That opportunity, however small, has a monetary value for the
purpose of Article 36 of the ILA Articles and the indemnities for compensation provided by
the two BITs’).

This is reflected for instance in Article 7.4.3(2) of the UNIDROIT Principles, according to
which “[c]ompensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of
is occurrence”. See also: Gemplus v. Mexico, Award of 16 June 2010, 9§ 13.96-13.100.

See, for instance: Mem., Title IV C (“Lost Opportunities: Ecuador Is Obligated To

PSC’); Tr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 822:4-22 (Cross of Dr. Aguilar, Blackaby) (“Mr. Aguilar,

opportunity.**" It claims, rather, the full value of the lost profits which it would
allegedly have obtained had the contract been extended (under the terms envisaged
by Mr. Moyes). “4

While the Tribunal could possibly attempt to assess the lost opportunity in monetary
terms, it finds that it would be too speculative for it to do so in the circumstances and
on the basis of the evidence before it. Indeed, as noted above, the State had
discretion to decide whether the contract would have been extended, within the
limits set out in the PSCs themselves, and this discretion involved the delicate
assessment of the best interests of the State. Hence, even if the Tribunal were to
find that the economic terms proposed by Mr. Moyes were reasonable, there is no
way for the Tribunal on its own to assess the probability that the contract would have
been extended, or on what terms. The Tribunal notes in this regard that it is not
prepared to rely on other contracts that were extended by Ecuador. In particular, the
Tribunal considers that the Repsol-Murphy contract and the AGIP contract are not
comparable because they were already service contracts (AGIP) or presupposed
acceptance of Law 42 payments (Repsol-Murphy).“

Nor can the Tribunal fail to observe that, at the relevant time, Burlington itself
appears to have assigned zero value to the chance of a contract extension. Indeed,
while the 2007 Sales Memorandum recognized the possibility of a contract
extension,*“* it did not project any production beyond the original term of the Block 7
PSC, i.e., August 2010.44

 

then the Minister or Petroecuador or whoever the official public authority is would extend the
Contract. That is my position”).

Although at the Hearing Mr. Moyes suggested that the Tribunal could adjust the value to
87.5% (because he had testified that 7 out of 8 contracts had been extended), and
Burlington’s counsel further suggested that the Tribunal could in its discretion decide to
award 60 or 70% of the amount claimed, Burlington's claim is for the total amount of the
profits to be generated by the extension. See: Compass Lexecon ER1, J 55-63.

See, for instance: Compass Lexecon ER1, {J 55-63.

R-PHB, §§ 180-186, citing: Tr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 974:19-975:1 (Cross, Moyes) and

The 2007 Sales Memorandum stated that “[aJn extension is possible, especially with a
commitment to enhance the productivity of the field beyond the continuation of a standard
drilling program. An offer to conduct pressure maintenance via water injection may be
attractive to Petroecuador and could be an enticement for a contract extension. It is thought
that any new field discovered will receive an automatic term extension to 2017” (Exh. E-
214).

For these reasons, the Tribunal dismisses Burlington’s damages claim for the lost
opportunity to extend the Block 7 PSC.

D. VALUATION

The Tribunal now turns to the valuation of the expropriated assets, i.e., the value of
the PSCs going forward, as identified in the previous sections. As noted above,
Ecuador agrees that this is a compensable loss, but argues that Burlington’s claim is
grossly inflated.

The Tribunal will first provide an overview of the Parties’ positions and their experts’
opinions (Section 1). It will then address the valuation method (Section 2), the date
of valuation (Section 3), and whether the economic effects of Law 42 should be
accounted for (Section 4). It will then proceed to the computation of cash flows,
assessing the different variables needed to determine revenues and costs, as well
as the applicable actualization and discount rates (Section 5). Finally, the Tribunal
will review Burlington’s claim that the award must be protected against taxation
(Section 6).

1. Overview of the Parties’ valuations

1.1. Overview of Burlington’s valuation

Burlington submits that the value of the PSCs is equivalent to the lost profits “from
the production foregone” that it would have received under the PSCs absent the
expropriation.

Relying on the full reparation standard, Burlington values these lost profits at the
date of the award. As a result, its lost production can be broken down in two
elements:4#°

i. Past lost profits, i.e., lost profits that would have accrued from December 2007
until the date of the award, with an interest factor applied to actualize the cash
flows to present value. Compass Lexecon refers to these as “historical lost
profits”. The Tribunal will refer to them as “past lost profits”.

ii. Future lost profits, i.e., lost profits that would have accrued from the date of the
award until the expiry of the PSCs, discounted to present value. Compass

Mem., § 74.

104

288.

447

448

Lexecon refers to these as the “fair market value” at the date of the valuation.
To simplify, the Tribunal will refer to them as “future lost profits”.

Applying accepted principles of corporate finance, Compass Lexecon undertook a
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis, simulating in its view the analysis that would
have been undertaken by willing buyers and sellers “with a long-term investment

perspective”, on the basis of the following elements:

Future cash flows were discounted to the valuation date at a rate equivalent to
the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of the project, which “represents
the opportunity cost of funding the operations of the PSCs”. Using the Capital
Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Compass Lexecon calculates the WACC of the
project at 12.1% in its First Report (with a valuation date in May 2013) and
12.5% in its Second Report (with a valuation date in September 2014).

Historical lost cash flows were “actualized” to the valuation date through the
application of interest at the same rate;

All lost profits were calculated net of the economic effects of Law 42, i.e., based
on the assumption that Ecuador would have complied with its obligations under
the PSCs;

Production was calculated “as it would have been, but for the crushing effects of
Ecuador's breaches”. Accordingly, the lost profits analysis starts in December
2007, when the Consortium ceased all investment in the Blocks as a result of
the 99% tax following Decree 662. Burlington explains that Compass Lexecon
correctly assumes that, in such a “but for” scenario the Consortium would have
continued investing rather than decreasing and eventually ceasing its
investment in the Blocks.**”? Specifically, Compass Lexecon bases its
projections on Mr. Crick’s production forecasts, which Compass Lexecon has
found to be consistent with the information on actual production and reserves
produced by Ecuador from early 2010 onwards.*#8

Compass Lexecon forecasts future crude oil prices using North Sea Brent
Crude (Brent) prices as a marker for Oriente crude (the crude oil produced by
Block 7) and Napo crude (the crude oil produced by Block 21) prices. To

Mem., § 77.
Compass Lexecon ER1, 6.

105

290.

291.

forecast Brent prices, Compass Lexecon uses a median of projections
published by industry analysts and US government agencies. After reviewing
the historical relationship between Brent prices and Oriente/Napo prices,
Compass Lexecon computes expected price paths for Oriente and Napo crudes
from the date of valuation until the expected expiration of the PSCs.*#°

vi. Compass Lexecon assumes operating costs (OPEX) and capital expenditures
(CAPEX) that are consistent with the Consortium’s historical expenditures,
updated with US PPI. With respect to the existing wells on Block 21, it also
bases its projections on historical operating, drilling, and maintenance costs as
incurred by the Consortium. With respect to the additional developments and
production from new wells projected by Mr. Crick, Compass Lexecon uses
“information on required investment costs based on Mr. Crick’s calculations”,
and estimates “variable operating costs (on a per barrel basis) that increase
proportionally to the volumes of fluids produced in line with the expected ratio of
water to crude oil fluid extraction”.“5°

Compass Lexecon also makes certain assumptions with respect to prices, taxation
and others, which are discussed in the sections below.

Using the methodology and assumptions described above, in its Second Report
Compass Lexecon values Burlington’s claim at USD 811.1 million. In the Model
submitted by both experts, this claim is updated to USD 753.5 million with a date of
valuation of 31 March 2015.*5' In the Updated Model this amount is stated to be
USD 840,954,354, including pre-award interest.

Burlington asserts that its experts have employed reasonable production estimates
to calculate the financial consequences of Ecuador’s unlawful conduct and that
these estimates have been “fully validated” by documents Ecuador was obliged to
produce in these proceedings.*** Burlington states that it seeks no more than the fair

If Compass Lexecon’s assumptions are chosen as inputs in the Model, the item “Value of
Operating Assets” amounts to USD 753,533,729 with a valuation date of 31 March 2015.

market value of its investment according to production volumes and estimates
“according to Ecuador's own figures”.4°

1.2 Overview of Ecuador’s valuation

Ecuador acknowledges that Burlington has a right to compensation for the value of
the PSCs, but contends that its claim is grossly inflated. According to Ecuador and
its expert, Fair Links, once the FMV of the PSCs is properly calculated, Burlington's
claim for lost profits shrinks to USD 26.3 million.**

Ecuador agrees that damages correspond to the FMV of its lost investment and that
the DCF is the proper method in the present case. However, it argues that
Burlington's valuation misapplies the relevant standards of compensation under the
Treaty and international law, is based on false assumptions, and applies an
exaggerated interest rate. In particular, it argues that:

i. The appropriate standard of compensation is that provided under Article III of
the Treaty, that is, the fair market value of Burlington’s investment on the date
of the expropriation, plus interest up to the date of payment (both under the
Treaty and customary international law). The customary international law
principle of full reparation does not apply to this case.

ii. Burlington wrongly uses the date of the award as date of valuation, when it
should use the date of the expropriation.

iii. Fair Links calculated the FMV of Burlington’s investment in the Blocks at
USD 26.3 million (excluding interest) “considering all the information available
as of the date of expropriation”.

iv. Burlington fails to account for Law 42 taxes when projecting future profits.

v. The interest rate used to actualize past lost profits can only be a risk-free rate,
as opposed to the WACC.

Ibid.
Rejoinder, § 451.

107

294.

295.

296.

Ecuador takes particular issue with Burlington’s application of interest, which
Ecuador points out amounts to USD 366 million out of a total valuation of USD 811.1
million. 4°

Finally, Ecuador acknowledges that, besides the interest rate, the other value
drivers chosen by Compass Lexecon have “a lesser impact” on the calculation of the
FMV. The values for CAPEX, OPEX, oil prices, and oil production volumes adopted
by Compass Lexecon “only affect Fair Links’ base case by USD 9.9 million,
increasing it from USD 26.3 million to USD 36.2 million”.4°°

2. | The DCF valuation method
2.1 Burlington’s position

Burlington requests the Tribunal to apply the DCF methodology to quantify its lost
profits claim. According to Burlington, to calculate the FMV of a going concern with
an established track record of historical cash flows, the future profit-making potential
of the investment must be taken into account.**”? As explained by Compass
Lexecon, the DCF method is the most appropriate technique in present
circumstances, since it ascertains the value of an asset on the basis of expected
future cash flows, taking into account the risk and the time value of money.“*? This
method has been applied by most recent awards and has become the industry
standard for valuing oil and gas interests.*°° For instance, in CMS, the tribunal held
the DCF method to be “universally adopted”. The Walter Bau tribunal deemed it to
be the “only method that can accurately track value through time”.*® In Occidental
I, DCF was called the “standard economic approach”.**' Accordingly, expected free
cash flows generated under the PSCs, “absent [i.e., ‘but for’] unlawful government

Mem., 4 148.

Id., § 149. Burlington further explains that a “forward-looking DCF valuation is not the same
as a calculation of damages for lost profits. It is simply a calculation of the fair market value
of the asset by reference to the future earnings potential of the asset”. /d., note 203.

conduct”, must be discounted “at a rate reflecting the business's costs of raising
capital and the appropriate levels of risk”.*©

2.2 Ecuador’s position

Ecuador agrees that the DCF method is the proper method in the present case.*®
Its expert, Fair Links, notes that “[tlhe DCF approach is a widely accepted and
implemented valuation method to determine the Fair Market Value of an asset”.‘®
Ecuador does not agree, however, that the FMV is “simply a proxy for the lost future
cash flows”, since under certain circumstances “lost future cash flows operate as a
proxy for FMV”, and argues that Compass Lexecon has admitted to calculating the
value of future cash flows, not the FMV of Burlington's investment.‘

In addition, for Ecuador, Compass Lexecon calculates the FMV by misrepresenting
the impact of various variables. Compass Lexecon “considers the value drivers
underlying a DCF valuation in a sequence that is not in keeping with how a DCF is
built”. For instance, Burlington’s expert considers taxation — Law 42 — before
considering oil production and oil prices, and thus does not show its full impact. Nor
does it show the full impact of applying an exaggerated 12.5% interest
(actualization) rate until the date of the award.*°° Both Law 42 and interest should be
considered “at the end of the sequence once revenue (production and price) are
determined”.*°” Indeed, when these value drivers are analyzed in the correct order,
“it becomes clear that the key differences in the Parties’ damages calculations are (i)
the application of Law 42 (a USD 409 million impact) and (ii) Burlington’s use of an
exaggerated 12.5% actualization rate to calculate pre-judgment interest (a USD 366
million impact)”.“°* By contrast, the other parameters (such as price, production,
CAPEX, OPEX and discount rate) have a lesser impact.*©°

2.3 Analysis

The Parties agree that Burlington’s investment should be valued using the DCF
method. The Tribunal concurs: as both Parties’ experts have noted, the DCF
method is widely accepted as an appropriate method to value going concerns, and
has been endorsed by the World Bank.4”°

The DCF method is an income-based valuation method. As Fair Links has
explained, this method “values an asset by considering its ability to generate future
economic benefits’.*”1 As Compass Lexecon puts it, “[bJusinesses have value
because they are expected to produce net cash flows to the investor at some point.
The DCF approach determines value on a particular date on the basis of the net
cash flows that the asset is expected to generate over time”.*”* Similarly, Fair Links
explains that “[u]nder this approach, the value of an asset is related to its expected
economic benefit, i.e. the remaining cash available to the investor or creditor once
the operating costs and capital expenditure of the asset have been paid. Assessing
these expected economic benefits allows one to determine the ‘free cash flows’
generated by the asset”.47>

Despite this, Ecuador appears to take issue with Compass Lexecon’s use of free
cash flows. The Tribunal is somewhat puzzled by this comment, as both Parties’
experts expressly agree on the use of the DCF method and thus necessarily agree
on valuing the investment on the basis of its future cash flows. The Tribunal thus
dismisses Ecuador's objection, to the extent that it is one.

Although there is agreement on the method of valuation, the Parties’ disagree on
several variables and assumptions to be used to perform the valuation, in particular
the date of valuation and whether the experts should use ex ante or ex post data,
and as well as the actualization rate to apply to past cash flows. The Tribunal
addresses these assumptions and variables in the following sections.

The World Bank considers that the determination of compensation for the FMV of a going
concern with a proven record of profitability will be deemed reasonable if undertaken on the
basis of the discounted cash flow value. World Bank (1992), “Guidelines on the Treatment of
Foreign Direct Investment”, Foreign Investment Law Journal, Chapter IV Expropriation and
unilateral alterations or termination of contracts, paragraphs 5 and 6 (Exh. CLEX-12).

Ecuador also objects to the sequence used by Compass Lexecon in its DCF
calculation. The Tribunal addresses this objection in Section VII.D.5.2.6 below.

3. Date of valuation
3.1 Burlington’s position

As explained in Section VII.B.1 above, Burlington submits that the standard of
compensation in cases of unlawful expropriation is the international law principle of
full reparation. Since an award of compensation must take the place of restitution, it
is “appropriate and logical to value the investment at the date of the award”.474

According to Burlington, this was the position adopted by the PClJ in Chorzow,
where the Court held that the wrongdoer should pay the value of the undertaking “at
the time of the indemnification”.‘”° This approach was adopted in other cases such
as Unglaube, Kardassopoulos, and ADC, and was again recently confirmed by the
Yukos tribunal.

Tribunals, such as in ADC, have particularly used this valuation date where the
value of the assets taken increased after the expropriation “due to objective factors,
such as improving market conditions”.47° Adopting another date, says Burlington,
would allow Ecuador to retain the increase in value and would thereby create
“perverse incentives, financially rewarding a State for its own unlawful conduct”.4””
Burlington argues that in the present case it is particularly important to compensate
for any increase in value, as this increase “is attributable to subsurface conditions
known by the investor at the time of expropriation but not fully exploited due to the
economic disincentives created by the State’s unlawful conduct”.47°

Burlington further argues that valuing the expropriated investment as at the date of
the award also ensures that the Tribunal has all relevant evidence at its disposal

with respect to the value of the assets at the time of the award.‘”? Burlington notes
in particular that it is now known to both Parties and the Tribunal how much Ecuador
actually produced in the oilfields since the expropriation, which supports Burlington's
projections.‘®°

For Burlington, the date of the award is the appropriate date of valuation regardless
of the nature of the unlawfulness that taints the expropriation. Whether the State
failed to make compensation or breached any of the “conduct” requirements of the
Treaty is irrelevant. The case law confirms this point. In ConocoPhillips, the
expropriation was unlawful because of the failure to comply with the compensation
standard under the treaty, and the tribunal valued the investment on the date of the
award.*®' Similarly, in Unglaube, the tribunal held that Costa Rica’s failure to offer
adequate and timely compensation was sufficient in itself to make the expropriation
unlawful, triggering the application of the customary international law standard.‘

Ecuador's attempts to discard these “settled principles” so as to minimize the
amount of damages are misplaced.*® As discussed in Section VII.B.1 above,
Burlington is of the view that the case law of the European Court of Human Rights
(ECtHR), which distinguishes between “inherently unlawful dispossession” and
expropriation unlawful for failure to pay compensation, provides little guidance in
investment disputes. *°*

With respect to investment case law and doctrine, Ecuador’s arguments are equally
unavailing and unpersuasive. Burlington stresses that, while the tribunal in Rurelec
took the date of the taking as the date of valuation, that solution resulted from the
plaintiff's choice of that specific date for the valuation.‘®° Furthermore, it should be

noted that the tribunal did hold the taking to be unlawful for lack of payment,
notwithstanding the fact that Bolivia made efforts to seek a solution.“°° And in
Funnekotter, the date of the award was not used because the value of the farms had
not increased in the meantime. That decision rather supports the opinion that the
date that best assures full reparation should be adopted.*®” Moreover, reliance on
Santa Elena is misplaced since that case concerned a lawful taking in which the
state recognized that compensation was due and the only issue to be determined
was the amount of compensation owed.*®°

Burlington states that Ecuador's argument based on Kardassopoulos according to
which the date of the award is only appropriate if the investor would have retained
the investment, is misconceived.**° In that case, the determination of the appropriate
valuation date did not hinge on whether the investor wished to retain the investment,
but whether he would have retained it. There, the tribunal held that the co-investors
likely would have bought the plaintiff's investment. In the present case, to the
contrary, by the time of the taking “it was clear that Burlington was not going to sell
its interests in Ecuador, regardless of Burlington’s preference”.*°° As Mr. Martinez
confirmed, prospective purchasers rescinded their offers after the introduction of
Decree 662, and with the seizures it became clear that “Burlington had no option but
to retain its investment’.**! Hence, whether Burlington wished to sell its investment
prior to the taking is irrelevant to the question whether it “would or could have done
so, but for the expropriation, in the period between the expropriation date and the
date of award”.*%?

claim and because its findings (in particular its decision not to rely on ex-post data),
“are entirely dependent on the unique factual circumstances of that case”.4™ In
particular, the tribunal held that, because Murphy had sold its interest, actual post-
sale production under new contractual conditions was not an appropriate proxy for
Murphy's but-for scenario. For Burlington, Murphy “supports the principle that ex-
post data should be used to determine the value of an investment when that data
reflects the but-for scenario, as is the case in this arbitration”,“°° and confirms that
“ex-post data can properly be used to validate ex-ante assumptions”, as is the case
here.“°® Burlington stresses that “Mr. Crick’s projections were first prepared in the
absence of the Petroamazonas data. Ecuador then produced that data, which
proved to line up almost perfectly with Mr. Crick’s projections. Moreover, even if this
Tribunal were to follow the Murphy tribunal’s decision not to use ex post information,
the result would be the same because Mr. Crick’s projections yield results fully
consistent with the actual performance of the Blocks in Ecuador's hands and as
assessed by Ryder Scott, even when Mr. Crick’s inputs are limited to technical data
available up to July 2009" .4°”

On this basis, Burlington submits that the appropriate valuation date is the date of
the award, or the closest proxy. Accordingly, in its first expert report, Compass
Lexecon used 30 April 2013 as the proxy date; in its second report, 15 September
2014, and in the Updated Model, 31 August 2016.

By contrast, says Burlington, Ecuador’s instructions to Fair Links to employ the date
of expropriation for valuation purposes must be rejected. Fair Links’ entire damage
analysis is flawed because it relied on old and incorrect data (production forecast, oil
price forecast, CAPEX figures), that are inconsistent with actual figures. 49°

3.2 Ecuador’s position

For Ecuador, it is clear that under both the BIT standard and customary international
law Burlington’s interests in Blocks 7 and 21 must be valued on the date of the

“purported expropriation”, as the expropriation at issue here was held to be unlawful
by the Tribunal solely for lack of compensation.‘

As noted in Section VII.B.2 above, Ecuador argues that the standard of
compensation is set out in Article III(1) of the Treaty. That provision makes clear that
the FMV of the expropriated asset is to be calculated on the date of the

expropriation:

“Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the
expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory
action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier, be
calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing
market rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include
interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of
expropriation, be fully realizable and be freely transferable”.5°
According to Ecuador, this is particularly the case for expropriations that are
unlawful only for failure to pay compensation, as is the case here. This is confirmed

by the reference to interest from the date of the expropriation.°'

Ecuador contends that customary international law leads to the same result.
According to Ecuador, “Burlington continues to devote the entirety of its analysis to
an assessment of compensation under customary international law without making
the distinction at the heart of the foundational case on which its analysis purports to
rest’,©° i.e. the Chorzow case. In that case, the PClJ drew a fundamental distinction
between expropriations that would have been lawful had compensation been paid,
and expropriations that would have been unlawful even if payment had been made.
The PClJ “went out of its way to clarify that it is where the wrongful act consists of
the failure to pay compensation for the taking that customary international law limits
compensation ‘to the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus
interest to the day of payment’”.5°

Ecuador also points to the ECtHR’s distinction between “inherently unlawful
dispossession” and “per se illegal dispossessions”, while some commentators refer
to expropriations unlawful only by virtue of failure to pay compensation as only

“unlawful sub modo” or “provisionally unlawful’.°%* Ecuador emphasizes that “[t]he
point of principle lies [...] not in the characterization of the taking, but in the universal
recognition that the phenomena being described is different from (and has a
different remedial response to) expropriations which would have been unlawful
regardless of whether compensation was paid”.5°>

Ecuador further emphasizes that Burlington has not cited to a single case involving
the expropriation of a going concern that was unlawful solely for failure to pay
compensation where the tribunal has valued the investment on the date of the
award, and the damages awarded corresponded to the value of restitution in kind.
Despite Burlington’s arguments, ConocoPhillips is not such a case, because the
tribunal held the expropriation to be unlawful not because of lack of compensation,
but because Venezuela breached the BIT requirement to engage in good faith
negotiations over the amount of compensation.°°° Nor can Burlington rely on
Siemens, ADC or Kardassopoulos, which all involved expropriations that were
unlawful for reasons other than failure to pay compensation.°°’ Nor does
Funnekotter assist Burlington; in that case the value of the investment had not
changed between the date of the taking and the date of the award, so the tribunal
found that the differences in computation for lawful and unlawful expropriation were
not at issue.*°? Finally, Burlington's “blind reliance” on Yukos is also misplaced, as
that was “manifestly not a case in which the taking was unlawful only because it was
unaccompanied by prompt, adequate and effective compensation”.5°°

In the present case, according to Ecuador, the Tribunal found the expropriation to be
unlawful solely due to Ecuador’s failure to pay compensation. As a result, whether
the Tribunal applies the treaty standard or customary international law, Burlington is

only entitled to compensation of its investment valued on the date of the
expropriation plus interest.5"°

In any event, Burlington cannot purport to profit from the alleged increased value of
the asset after the date of expropriation. For Ecuador, “[clompensation for increased
value between the date of the expropriation and the date of the award is premised
on the fact that the investor intended to keep the asset”.°"' This was confirmed in
Kardassopoulos, where the tribunal clearly stated that this rationale only applies “in
cases where it is demonstrated that the Claimants would, but for the taking, have
retained their investment”.5"? This is not the case here: the evidence in the record
shows that even before Law 42 came into effect, Burlington had the intention to sell
its interest in the Blocks, and continued to seek to do so in 2007 and 2008.°'*

Ecuador also relies on Murphy v. Ecuador®"* to argue that the Tribunal must value
the expropriated investment on the date of the expropriation. Ecuador emphasizes
that the Murphy decision “deals with exactly the same legal issues and the same
factual background that this Tribunal is currently dealing with’.°'® Ecuador notes in
particular that the Murphy tribunal applied the Treaty governing in the present case
and analyzed the impact of Law 42 on similar participation contracts, albeit in the
context of breaches to Article IIl(2) of the Treaty. For Ecuador, Murphy supports a
valuation on the date of the expropriation using ex ante information because that
tribunal:

i. “[DJecided that, whilst Chorzow was applicable in that case, the full reparation
standard aims at ‘full reparation’ of the concrete and_ actual damage incurred
and that it provides a large margin of appreciation to tribunals with respect to
the selection of an appropriate valuation method”, and

i. “[F]ound that an ex-post approach was not appropriate because the ex-post
data generated after March 2009 (such as oil price and production data) did not
reflect what the situation would have been in a but-for scenario”.°"®

For the reasons set out above, Ecuador submits that, if compensation is due, it
should be based on the value of the investment on the date of the expropriation (i.e.,
30 August 2009) using ex ante information, plus interest.

3.3. Analysis

The Tribunal has already determined that the standard of compensation in this case
is the full reparation principle under customary international law. It has also clarified
that it need not determine whether the standard of compensation under customary
international law is different for expropriations that are unlawful solely as a result of
the failure to pay compensation as opposed to expropriations that are unlawful on
other grounds (see paragraph 176 above), given that Ecuador’s expropriation of
Burlington’s investment was unlawful not only as a result of Ecuador’s failure to pay
compensation, but also because the expropriation was not done in accordance with
other conditions for a lawful expropriation.

In the majority’s view, the full reparation standard requires that the damages
resulting from the unlawful act be valued on the date of the award, using information
available at that point in time. This conclusion derives from the Chorzéw case,
where the PClJ stated that, in cases where the State’s wrongful act was not limited
to failure to pay compensation, the compensation to be awarded “is not necessarily
limited to the value of the undertaking at the moment of the dispossession, plus
interest to the day of payment”.®” According to the Court, “[t]his limitation would only
be admissible if the Polish Government had the right to expropriate, and if its
wrongful act consisted merely in not having paid to the two Companies the just price
of what was expropriated”.5"® By contrast, when the expropriation is unlawful,>'? the

Chorzow, p. 47 (Exh. CL-102). The PClJ reiterates this principle when rejecting the use of a
previously negotiated contract price or offer of sale. The PClJ states that “[iJt has already
been pointed out above that the value of the undertaking at the moment of dispossession
does not necessarily indicate the criterion for the fixing of compensation. Now it is certain
that the moment of the contract of sale and that of the negotiations with the Genevese
Company belong to a period of serious economic and monetary crisis; the difference
between the value which the undertaking then had and that which it would have had at
present may therefore be very considerable”. /d., p. 50.

State is required to make full reparation for the injury caused, and this “reparation
must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-
establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not
been committed”.5° According to the Court, this ‘involves the obligation to restore
the undertaking and, if this be not possible, to pay its value at the time of the
indemnification, which value is designed to take the place of restitution which has
become impossible”.**! The Court highlighted that to conclude otherwise would be
“tantamount to rendering lawful liquidation and unlawful dispossession
indistinguishable in so far as their financial results are concerned”.5*2

The Court's task was thus to determine “what sum must be awarded [...] to place
the dispossessed Companies as far as possible in the economic situation in which
they would probably have been if the seizure had not taken place”. To this end,
the Court requested an expert to conduct two valuations: one based on the asset
value of the undertaking on the date of the taking plus any additional profits accrued
until the date of the judgment (Question |),5** and another based on the asset value
of the undertaking on the date of the judgment (Question II).°° Both valuations had

Id., p. 49.

In Question |, the Court requested the expert to establish the value of the undertaking on the
date of the expropriation on the basis of its assets, as well as the financial results (profits or
losses) that would have accrued from the date of the taking to the date of the judgment. It did
so in the following terms: “I.- A. What was the value, on July 3rd, 1922, expressed in
Reichsmarks current at the present time, of the undertaking for the manufacture of nitrate
products of which the factory was situated at Chorzow in Polish Upper Silesia, in the state in
which that undertaking (including the lands, buildings, equipment, stocks and processes at
its disposal, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects) was, on the date
indicated, in the hands of the Bayerische and Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke?

B. What would have been the financial results, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the
present time (profits or losses), which would probably have been given by the undertaking
thus constituted from July 3rd, 1922, to the date of the present judgment, if it had been in the
hands of the said Companies?”. /d., p. 51.

In Question II, the Court requested the expert to establish the value of the undertaking on the
date of the judgment if that undertaking (considering all of its assets) had remained in the
hands of the dispossessed companies and had either remained substantially as it had been
on the date of the taking or had developed in a similar fashion as other undertakings of the
same kind. It did so in the following terms: “Il.- What would be the value at the date of the
present judgment, expressed in Reichsmarks current at the present time, of the same
undertaking (Chorzow) if that undertaking (including lands, buildings, equipment, stocks,
available processes, supply and delivery contracts, goodwill and future prospects) had
remained in the hands of the Bayerische and Oberschlesische Stickstoffwerke, and had

the same purpose, which was to establish the value of the losses suffered by the
dispossessed companies on the date of the Court’s judgment. The losses on the
date of the judgment could be assessed either by reference to the value of the
undertaking on the date of the taking plus any lost profits accrued between the
taking and the judgment, or by reference to the value of the undertaking on the date
of the judgment. Although the Court did not use a DCF computation but an asset-
based valuation, under both valuations it would have awarded the value of the
losses on the date of the judgment.®?°

After recognizing the difficulties of this exercise, especially considering “the time that
elapsed between the dispossession and the demand for compensation, and with the
transformations of the factory and the progress made in the industry with which the
factory is concerned”,®*’ the Court “reserve[d] every right to review the valuations
referred to in the different formulae; basing itself on the results of the said valuations
and of facts and documents submitted to it, it will then proceed to determine the sum
to be awarded to the German Government, in conformity with the legal principles set
out above”.526

The Chorz6w case settled thereafter, with the result that we do not know how the
Court would have determined the amount of damages. However, three fundamental
conclusions can be drawn from the Court's ruling: (i) under the full reparation
principle, damages should be a substitute for restitution that has become
impossible; (ii) because damages must replace restitution, they should be valued on
the date on which compensation is awarded; and (iii) tribunals have full discretion to
assess the valuations for purposes of determining the amount to be awarded.

On this basis, the majority concludes that where the expropriation was unlawful for
several reasons, including the failure to pay compensation (as is the case here), the
appropriate valuation date is the date of the award or a proxy for that date — it being
noted once again that here it is not necessary to determine whether a different
standard is called for where the unlawfulness results solely from a failure to pay

 

either remained substantially as it was in 1922 or had been developed proportionately on
lines similar to those applied in the case of other undertakings of the same kind, controlled
by the Bayerische, for instance, the undertaking of which the factory is situated at

compensation. Other investment tribunals®*° and adjudicatory bodies (including the
ECtHR),°*° as well as several scholars,**' have come to the same conclusion.

It is true that Ecuador has submitted that Burlington cannot benefit from increases in
the value of its investment after the expropriation because it was in any event
seeking to sell Blocks 7 and 21. In support of this argument, Ecuador relies on
Kardassopoulos, where the tribunal stated that ‘“[iJt may be appropriate to
compensate for value gained between the date of the expropriation and the date of
the award in cases where it is demonstrated that the Claimants would, but for the
taking, have retained their investment”.®* It is undisputed that Burlington was trying

the award; Siemens v. Argentina, Award of 6 February 2007, 9] 322-389 (Exh. CL-79),
where although the tribunal endorsed the view that the principle of full reparation required
awarding the value of the investment on the date of the award, it was ultimately guided by
the claimant's request for relief, which sought the book value of the investment at the time of
the expropriation plus lost profits and other consequential damages arisen thereafter.

to sell its investment prior to the enactment of Law 42 and continued to do so at
least until 2007.53 However, Burlington was unable to sell, and this failure was due
at least in part to the increasingly hostile environment for oil investments in Ecuador.
As a result, but for the expropriation, the Tribunal accepts on the basis of the record
that Burlington would in fact have kept its investment.

The majority’s conclusion on the valuation date has two implications. First, it means
that the Tribunal may take into consideration information post-dating the
expropriation. The Tribunal's task is to place Burlington in the situation it would have
been had Ecuador not expropriated the PSCs. For this, the Tribunal must assess
what the PSC’s value would have been in real life on the date of the award. Such a
valuation will obviously be more accurate and reliable if actual information is used in
respect of relevant facts that have occurred between the expropriation and the
award, rather than projections based on information available on the date of the
expropriation. The valuation will be closer to reality if the Tribunal decides with
“maximum information” rather than “maximum ignorance”.*** The same rationale
was adopted in Amco II:

“If the purpose of compensation is to put Amco in the position it would
have been in had it received the benefits of the Profit-Sharing
Agreement, then there is no reason of logic that requires that to be
done by reference only to data that would have been known to a
prudent businessman in 1980. It may, on one view, be the case that
in a lawful taking, Amco would have been entitled to the fair market
value of the contract at the moment of dispossession. In making such
a valuation, a Tribunal in 1990 would necessarily exclude factors
subsequent to 1980. But if Amco is to be placed as if the contract had
remained in effect, then subsequent known factors bearing on that
performance are to be reflected in the valuation technique. [...]”.5%°

Mr. Martinez testified during the hearing on provisional measures that “Burlington Resources
has attempted to sell, and actually we were fairly close to the sale prior to the enactment of
Law 42, which affected that sale” (Tr. Provisional Measures (Day 1) (ENG), 149:9-11 (Cross,
Martinez)). Mr. Martinez confirmed this during the hearing on liability (Tr. Liability (ENG) (Day
2), 385:1-9 (Direct, Martinez): “Q: Mr. Martinez, shifting gears again, Ecuador has made
much of the fact that Burlington was looking to sell its interests in Blocks 7 and 21 even
before Law 42 went into effect. Can you address this. Is it true that Burlington was looking to
sell these two Blocks? A. We had some unsolicited offers in 2006. In 2007, we were looking
to just divest of the Blocks, so, yes”).

One might object that using information post-dating the expropriation would
somehow conflict with the requirement of causation, which is sometimes linked to
foreseeability. However, the fact that some of the information used to quantify lost
profits on the date of the award may not have been foreseeable on the date of the
expropriation does not break the chain of causation. What matters is that the injury
suffered must have been caused by the wrongful act. It is true that factual causation
is not sufficient, and that an additional element linked to the exclusion of injury that
is too remote or indirect (sometimes referred to as legal or adequate causation) is
required, and it is in this context where foreseeability plays a role.*°° If an injury was
not objectively foreseeable because it was caused by an unusual chain of events
that could not foreseeably derive from the act, legal causation may be absent and
recovery may be excluded. However, if the injury was objectively foreseeable (i.e.,
because the act was objectively capable of causing the injury), then the test for both
factual and legal causation will normally be met. It is generally accepted that the
expropriation of a going concern is objectively capable of causing the loss of its
future profit stream, and thus this loss is foreseeable. It is also foreseeable that
these future profits may fluctuate depending on various economic and other
variables, including prices, costs, inflation and interest rates, among others.

Contrary to Ecuador’s contentions, the Tribunal does not believe that the Murphy
decision®?’ stands for the proposition that valuations must necessarily be carried out
solely on the basis of ex ante information. First, the Murphy tribunal held that “[t]he
full reparation standard aims at ‘full reparation’ of the concrete and actual damage
incurred”, and “provides a large margin of appreciation to tribunals with respect to
the selection of an appropriate valuation method”,®* two propositions that underlie
the Tribunal’s analysis above. Second, the Murphy tribunal did not say that the use
of ex post information is proscribed; to the contrary, it held that “an ex-post approach

 

judgment or award, must be taken into account in the evaluation of damages”) (Exh. EL-
255).

See: ILC Articles, Article 31, Commentary 10. (“[C]ausality in fact is a necessary but not a
sufficient condition for reparation. There is a further element, associated with the exclusion of
injury that is too “remote” or “consequential” to be the subject of reparation. In some cases,
the criterion of “directness” may be used, in others “foreseeability” or “proximity”).

establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been

336.

is not appropriate in this case because the ex-post data generated after the sale of
Murphy Ecuador does not reflect what the situation would have been in a but-for
scenario”.5%°

In the Tribunal’s reading, Murphy thus confirms that tribunals have a large margin of
appreciation in attempting to quantify the amount of compensation that will wipe out
the effects of the wrongful act. If, in the circumstances of the particular case, the use
of ex post information is relevant, reasonable and reliable, it is the majority's opinion
that it should be preferred to ex ante information. As noted in Quiborax, “[t]he
Tribunal must value the loss with reasonable certainty. If the available ex post data
is not reasonably certain, then it will have no choice but to resort to appropriately
adjusted ex ante data [...]’.5*° As discussed further below, in building its
counterfactual scenario the Tribunal has used ex post data whenever it has
considered that it allows to calculate Burlington’s loss with reasonable certainty.

The second implication of a valuation on the date of the award is that the Tribunal
must consider two sets of lost profits: profits that would have accrued from the date
of the expropriation until the date of award (past lost profits) and profits that would
have accrued from the date of the award until the expiry of the contractually agreed
term of the PSCs (future lost profits).°’ Both sets of cash flows must be brought to
present value: past cash flows must be brought forward to present value through the
application of an interest rate and future cash flows must be brought to present
value through the application of a discount rate. Past cash flows are calculated on
the basis of information available on the date on which those cash flows would have
accrued, while future cash flows are projected on the basis of the latest available
information on the date of the award (or its closest proxy). The Tribunal discusses
these valuations in more detail in the following sections.

Id., § 484 (emphasis added). See also: { 485.
Quiborax v. Bolivia, Award of 16 September 2015, § 384.

The majority is aware that in Chorzéw the PClJ reasoned that the valuation on the date of
the judgment (Question II) would only include profits (Iucrum cessans) between the date of
the dispossession and the date of the judgment if those profits had not been absorbed in the
cost of the upkeep, development and improvement of the undertaking (Chorzow, p. 53).
However, the PClJ was using an asset-based valuation method, so any such profits would
have been added to the value of the undertaking’s assets, creating a risk of double-counting.
Here, the Tribunal is using an income-based valuation method (specifically, the DCF
method) that values the investment exclusively on the basis of the economic benefit it is
expected to generate (see: paragraph 300 above). As a result, in the majority's view, the risk
of double-counting identified by the PICJ does not arise here.

124

For the reasons set out above, the majority will value the compensation due to
Burlington for the unlawful expropriation of its investment on 31 August 2016 (the
date used by the Parties’ quantum experts in their Updated Model) as a proxy for
the date of the award. Arbitrator Stern disagrees with this method of valuation.°4?

4. Should the economic effects of Law 42 be accounted for?
4.1 Burlington’s position

Burlington submits that “in valuing Burlington’s expropriated investment, [the
Tribunal should] give full value to its contract rights”.°“? In particular, the valuation of
Burlington's lost profits should be insulated against the economic effects of Law 42.
In other words, the valuation should assume that Ecuador would have complied with
its tax absorption obligations under the PSCs. As a result, Burlington contends that:

i. Its cash flows should be valued as if Ecuador had provided Burlington with its
production share indemnified against the effects of Law 42.5

ii. Burlington’s production should be calculated as it would have been but for the
“crushing effects of Ecuador's breaches of the PSCs’, i.e., assuming that
Burlington would have continued its pre-Law 42 investment program.
Consequently, when building Burlington’s production profile, Compass Lexecon
assumes that Burlington’s drilling would have been consistent with its pre-Law
42 investment profile, as described by Mr. Crick.*5 As noted above, because
Burlington stopped investing in December 2007, Compass Lexecon starts its
lost profits analysis on that date.5**

In respect of (i), Burlington submits that the valuation of this claim should disregard
the effects of Law 42 for the following main reasons. First, relying on Occidental II
and SPP, Burlington argues that compensation for expropriation “must proceed on
the basis that the expropriated investment includes the contractual entitlements that

Arbitrator Stern disagrees with the analysis using ex post information, as well as adding
profits between the date of the expropriation and the date of the award, as she is convinced
that this methodology opens the way to some possible form of double counting. For further
discussion, see: Partially Dissenting Opinion to the Award of 16 September 2015 in Quiborax

were its foundation’.“” The Tribunal confirmed that the value of Burlington's
investment included the right to receive its production share shielded from the
economic effects of Law 42.5° Indeed, the Tribunal found that “the contract rights
under the PSCs represented a key component of Burlington’s investment”, that it
was “by virtue of these contract rights that, through its subsidiary, Burlington had
access to a share of the oil produced”, and that these rights had “a direct incidence
on the economic value of Burlington's investment”.*° The Tribunal further found that
“[t]he tax absorption clauses contained in the PSCs were part and parcel of the
value of Burlington's investment”.®° The Tribunal need not declare Law 42 illegal or
expropriatory, but Burlington has the right to be indemnified against the effects of
Law 42, and that indemnity “operated until the expiry of the PSCs”.5°"

Second and in relation to the foregoing argument, Burlington asserts that damages
must be calculated presuming compliance with the contractual framework.*? To
prevent Ecuador from expropriating contractual rights with impunity, damages must
be calculated “as if’ Ecuador had complied with its contractual obligations, (in other
words, “but for” its breach of those obligations).° In Occidental Il, Ecuador's
argument that Law 42 should be taken into consideration when assessing a
“hypothetical sale” of Block 15 was rejected as suffering a “fundamental flaw’, since
Occidental’s investment “was protected against the economic effects of Law 42”.
As a result, the tribunal in that case held that “what must be calculated is the
discounted cash flow value of the Participation Contract excluding breaches of it by
the Respondent”®®> and it disregarded Law 42 for the purpose of its valuation of the
quantum.°* It is Burlington’s submission that the solution adopted in Occidental II is

“commanded by international law’ and should be followed “in the present, virtually
identical circumstances”.°°”

In the same vein, Burlington argues that Ecuador cannot rely on its own breach of
contract to lower the damages. Arbitral tribunals have consistently applied the
principle nullus commodum capere de sua injuria propria. As a result, “for ‘full
reparation’ to wipe out all of the effects of the wrongful acts, value-depressing
measures taken prior to an ultimate confiscation must be excluded from the
assessment of damages”.°° For instance, in Phillips Petroleum, the tribunal held
that it “must exclude from its calculation of compensation any diminution of value
resulting from the taking of the Claimant's property or from any prior threats or
actions by the Respondent related thereto”. Likewise, in Amoco the tribunal
disregarded any value-depressing conduct prior to the breach. Similarly,
Chorzéw’s statement that damages are “not necessarily limited to the value of the
undertaking at the moment of dispossession” means that, “in order for reparation to
‘wipe out all the consequences’ of expropriation, measures that chip away at an
investment'’s value prior to the final taking must be taken as seriously as the final act
that extinguishes the investment completely”.* In Sedco, the tribunal thought it to
be “highly improper” to discount the value of a going concern based on the State’s
prior wrongful conduct,5* and in Azurix damages were determined “in a hypothetical
context where the State would not have resorted to such maneuvers but would have
fully respected the provisions of the treaty and the contract concerned”.5**

Faced with Ecuador's argument that the Tribunal found no creeping expropriation in
this case, Burlington submits that “[i]nternational law requires exclusion of the
effects of any [...] wrongful conduct” and does not distinguish “by category of
wrongful conduct so long as it’s related to the same enterprise or the same general
set of facts — here, the same enterprise or general sets of facts being the investment

in Block 7 and Block 21”.5® Burlington in particular invokes American International
Group, where the tribunal stated that “[i]n ascertaining the going concern value of an
enterprise at a previous point in time for purposes of establishing the appropriate
quantum of compensation for nationalization, it is [...] necessary to exclude the
effects of actions taken by the nationalizing State in relation to the enterprise which
actions may have depressed its value”.5°

Here, the Tribunal should follow the approach taken in Occidental Il, where in a
similar situation the tribunal (by majority) excluded the effects of Law 42 from the
consideration of damages.*®” According to Occidental II, the only value-depressing
acts that may be taken into account in the valuation of damages are “general
political, social and economic conditions”, i.e., acts that are not aimed at and do not
concern the specific investment.5 As to the Occidental II dissent, the crux of that
opinion was to say that the contract contained a renegotiation and not a tax
absorption clause.°®° In the present case, however, the Tribunal has already held
that the PSCs do contain “mandatory” tax absorption clauses.5”° Hence, Law 42
must be disregarded in the computation of Burlington’s future damages.

Burlington further contends that Ecuador’s defenses should be disregarded for the
following further reasons. Whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction or not over
Burlington’s contract claims is irrelevant. Burlington's claim is a treaty, not a contract
claim. Burlington is not asking the Tribunal to uphold its contract claims under the
PSCs; it is simply asking the Tribunal to compensate the value of its expropriated
investments, which include its contract right to tax absorption under the PSCs.°”!

In addition, Burlington insists that, as explained in Section VII.C.1.1 above,
Ecuador’s argument on contractual waiver fails. The Tribunal has already held that
Burlington’s Subsidiaries did not waive the underlying rights and that Burlington can
thus rely on them to pursue its treaty claims.” More specifically, “Burlington [did
not] waive its Treaty right to be compensated for the full effects of Law 42”.579

4.2 Ecuador’s position

According to Ecuador, the Tribunal must take into account the effects of Law 42
when calculating the FMV of Burlington's investment.5”

First, for the reasons set out in Section VII.V.1.2 above, Ecuador argues that the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Burlington’s claims relating to Law 42 because they
are based in contract. To value Burlington’s investment on the basis of these
contract rights would allow Burlington to reintroduce through the back door claims
that have already been dismissed.°”5

Even if the Tribunal were to consider that it has jurisdiction over these claims,
Ecuador contends that the valuation of Burlington’s investment must reflect the
effects of Law 42 because (i) as a result of the waiver of contractual rights, a willing
buyer could not enforce the right to be protected from the effects of Law 42, and (ii)
even if the waiver argument fails, Law 42 cannot be construed as a value-
depressing measure that should be disregarded for valuation purposes.

With respect to (i), Ecuador submits that “as a result of the waiver with prejudice,
Burlington's alleged contractual right to be insulated against the effects of Law 42 is
unenforceable and, hence, valueless”.5’ This is because an hypothetical willing
buyer would be placed in the same position as a willing seller, namely Burlington,
whose Subsidiaries have “waived the possibility of ever refiling their claims under
the Participation Contracts in any form in the future”.®”” Any willing buyer would thus
be barred from enforcing the right to be indemnified against the effects of Law 42.57
According to Ecuador, this is true not only of Burlington's already existing but also of

its future contract claims.°” Burlington's contention that a willing buyer could
enforce new claims based on new violations of the contract rights is unavailing since
the willing buyer would have “acquired Burlington’s shares in the Contract Claimants
(as opposed to the Participation Contracts)”, and hence any claim brought in the
future on the basis of the tax renegotiation clauses “would still be the same claims
that were waived by the Contract Claimants, and not ‘new’ claims”.5®°

With respect to (ii), Ecuador asserts that, even in the absence of a waiver, Law 42
should not be construed as a value-depressing measure and should be taken into
account when assessing damages.®*' This is essentially so for two reasons. First, a
willing buyer would necessarily have taken the impact of Law 42 into account when
assessing the FMV of the investment. Any valuation of Burlington’s assets must take
into account the impact of “generally applicable Ecuadorian law prior to the date of
expropriation”:5** Law 42 was duly enacted and its constitutionality was affirmed by
the Ecuadorian Constitutional Court. As a result, a willing buyer would not have
discarded its impact.®* Nor can a valuation ignore the impact of “binding restrictions
and the effects on the price of existing risks”. In particular, ‘[mJeasures similar to
Law 42 are common in the petroleum industry and should be factored in when
determining the price that a willing buyer may agree to pay”.5® Moreover, in its own
negotiations, Burlington never hinted that the effects of Law 42 should be ignored.**°
In particular, ConocoPhillips’ memorandum of May 2007 for the proposed sale of its
assets in Ecuador (the “ConocoPhillips Sales Memorandum”) referred to the
existence of Law 42, but did not state that the PSCs contained a tax stabilization
clause that would wipe out the effects of Law 42.%°” Tellingly, the offers made by
prospective buyers in 2007 did take into account the impact of Law 42 in the
assessment of the value of the Blocks. 8°

As a second reason not to view Law 42 as value-depressing, Ecuador invokes that
such law is not an internationally wrongful act.*° In its Decision on Liability, the
Tribunal refused to find that Law 42 was an internationally wrongful act, whether at
50% or at 99%. According to Ecuador, the Tribunal held it liable only for the failure
to pay compensation to Burlington following its intervention in the Blocks.°%°

Nor is Law 42 a value-depressing measure intended to diminish the value of
Burlington's investment.®*' The cases relied upon by Burlington are inapposite since
they deal with breaches consisting of composite acts, as set out in Article 15 of the
ILC Articles.5°? For instance, in Phillips Petroleum, the tribunal dealt with a “chain of
events”, just as the Azurix tribunal was confronted with “cumulative actions” leading
to the treaty breaches.°°? American International and Sedco make clear that “it is
only when the measures, in combination, are intended to depress the value of an
investment” that they are deemed part of a creeping expropriation.®™ In the present
case, the Tribunal excluded the hypothesis of creeping expropriation.°°° Equally
unavailing is Burlington’s reliance on Sempra and Enron. Not only did both of these
cases relate to composite acts, but the tribunals denied the existence of an
expropriation, finding only FET breaches.°%

It is Ecuador's further submission that reliance on Occidental I! is equally misplaced.

breached the participation contract, thus flouting the investor's legitimate

expectations.°°” Here, the Tribunal already held that Law 42 did not breach the
PSCs or the BIT.5* Burlington’s (and Occidental If's) reliance on Prof. Marboe’s
treatise is also misguided, as the quote on which they rely relates to measures
intended to depress the value of an investment just before the expropriation, which
was not the case here.°°® Ecuador also recalls that Prof. Stern dissented in
Occidental II, holding that Law 42 should have been taken into account in the
calculation of damages. ®°

Finally, argues Ecuador, there is no basis for relying on Tippetts and Siemens since
these cases did not deal with a situation where contract rights had been waived.
Moreover, in both cases, the receivables under scrutiny were in fact not in dispute at
the time of expropriation.®'

For these reasons, the valuation of Burlington’s investment should reflect the
taxation of extraordinary revenues at 99%, as well as a production profile assuming
that Burlington had made and would have continued to make Law 42 payments.

Fair Links’ reports show how disregarding Law 42 inflates revenues and production
volumes by USD 409 million.®? Specifically:

i. With respect to revenues, Fair Links “considers that 99% of the Extraordinary
Revenues above the Reference Price would have to be contributed to Ecuador.
Instead, based on instructions from Burlington, Compass Lexecon includes all
the Extraordinary Revenues in Burlington’s revenues for the purposes of
calculating its claimed damage”.

additional wells would have been drilled in Block 7, which in turn impacts crude
oil production and related capital expenditures. °*

4.3. Analysis

The standard of compensation being full reparation, the Tribunal’s task is to place
Burlington in the position in which it would have been but for the expropriation. The
Tribunal has found that the expropriation deprived Burlington of the possibility of
exercising its rights under the PSCs and deriving revenues therefrom from 30
August 2009 onwards. The Tribunal must therefore quantify the compensation that
will replace the value of the PSCs. It is common ground that this quantification can
be effected on the basis of the PSCs’ future profit-generating capacity using the
DCF method. This exercise requires calculating as accurately as possible the
revenues which would have accrued to Burlington under the PSCs from the date of
the expropriation until the date of the scheduled expiry of the PSCs in a
counterfactual scenario in which the expropriation is deemed not to have occurred.
The question here is whether, when assessing the value of the PSCs’ revenue
stream, the Tribunal should assume that extraordinary revenues are taxed at 99%
(as mandated by Law 42) or that Ecuador absorbs the impact of this tax.

In the Tribunal’s view, when quantifying the value of the expropriated assets, the
Tribunal must proceed on the basis that Burlington is entitled to exercise all of the
contractual rights it would have had but for the expropriation, and that Ecuador
would have complied with its contractual obligations going forward. In other words,
when building the counterfactual scenario in which the expropriation has not
occurred, the Tribunal must assume that Burlington holds the rights that made up
the expropriated assets and that those rights are respected. This does not mean
that the Tribunal is enforcing a contract claim. What the Tribunal does is to value an
expropriated asset, which the Parties agree consists of a bundle of rights allowing
Burlington to obtain future revenues.

In this case, the expropriated contracts included a mandatory tax absorption clause
which cannot be ignored for valuation purposes. Indeed, in the Decision on Liability,
“for the sole purpose of the resolution of the Treaty claim before it’, the Tribunal
found that “the PSCs provided for the following rights: (i) the right to receive and sell
the contractor's share of oil production irrespective of the price of oil and its internal

rate of return, subject to the payment of the taxes and employment contributions
specified in the PSCs; and (ii) the right to the application of a mechanism that would
absorb the effects of any tax increase affecting the economy of the PSCs, i.e. a right
to tax absorption under certain conditions”.

After analyzing the relevant language, purpose and context of the PSC,° the
Tribunal found that Ecuador was under an obligation to apply a correction factor that
would wipe out the effects of Law 42.°” This meant in practice that, after having
taxed Burlington’s extraordinary revenues at 99% (as mandated by Law 42),
Burlington's oil production share had to be increased to the point at which the impact
of Law 42 was eliminated.®® In other words, Burlington's revenues should be
restored to their pre-Law 42 levels. Accordingly, the PSCs gave Burlington the
contractual right to generate revenues as if Law 42 did not exist. The Tribunal is
aware that the Perenco tribunal adopted a different reasoning, but this Tribunal
stands by its finding that the impact of new taxes needed to be wiped out.

As determined in the Decision on Liability, the “[t]he tax absorption clauses
contained in the PSCs were part and parcel of the value of Burlington’s
investment”.°° As a result, the value of the expropriated assets going forward
includes the right to the application of a correction factor which would wipe out the
effects of Law 42.

It follows that when calculating the PSCs’ future revenue stream, the effects of Law
42 must be ignored. This is not because Law 42 was an internationally wrongful act

See: Article 11.7 of the Block 7 PSC and Article 15.2 of the Block 21 PSC, transcribed at
DoL, 9 335 and 405, respectively.

See: DoL, § 327 (‘[...] the tax modification provision contained in clause 11.12 of the PSC for
Block 7 calls for the application of a mandatory correction factor that absorbs any impact of a
tax increase or decrease on the economy of the Contract”), § 333 (“[...] the language of [the
tax modification clause of the PSC for Block 21] calls for the mandatory adjustment of the
parties’ oil production shares ‘in order to restore the economics of the contract in place
before the tax modification”), and § 334 (“the application of a correction factor is mandatory
when a tax affects the economy of the PSCs for Blocks 7 or 21. This correction factor must
be of such extent as to wipe out the effects of the tax on the economy of the PSC. Otherwise
stated, the correction factor must restore the economy of the PSC to its pre-tax modification
level”).

See: /d., § 315 (“[...] the economy of the PSCs was not a function of either a projected oil
price of USD 15/bbl or of a contractor’s IRR of 15%. Rather, the economy of the PSCs
entitled the contractor to receive its oil participation share, dispose of it on the market
irrespective of price, and thus to obtain its oil share’s market value — subject to the applicable
taxes and to the contract provisions on new taxes”).

or an otherwise unlawful value-depressing measure. It is because Ecuador was
contractually required to apply a correction factor that would “wipe out the effects of
the tax on the economy of the PSC”,*"° and that right is “part and parcel of the value
of Burlington’s investment”.®'' The fact that Ecuador had breached this contractual
obligation in the past®!? and threatened to do so in the future cannot diminish
Ecuador's liability. As the Iran-US Claims Tribunal observed in Tippetts, “[iJt is a well
recognized principle in many municipal systems and in international law that no one
should be allowed to reap advantages from their own wrong, nullus commodum
capere de sua injuria propria’.*" |n particular, when quantifying the value of a going
concern, the Tribunal must disregard the effects of value-depressing measures
taken by the State related to the investment.°'*

The Tribunal’s determination that Ecuador's breaches of the PSCs’ tax absorption
clauses was not an expropriation does not modify this conclusion. The Tribunal must
quantify the value of what was taken, and what was taken were contracts providing
among other things for the right to tax absorption. Nor is this inconsistent with the
Tribunal’s dismissal of Burlington’s claim for past Law 42 dues: the tax absorption
clauses form part of the asset that was taken, so when building the counterfactual
scenario the Tribunal must assume that they apply. By contrast, Burlington’s credits
against Ecuador for the amounts owed by Ecuador as a result of the application of
these clauses before the expropriation were not taken by Ecuador's takeover of the
Blocks.

The value of Burlington's investment must thus assume that Burlington can exercise
its contractual rights, including the right to tax absorption. Ecuador contends
however that “as a result of the waiver with prejudice, Burlington’s alleged
contractual right to be insulated against the effects of Law 42 is unenforceable and,

State in relation to the enterprise which actions may have depressed its value”). See also:
Phillips Petroleum v. Iran, Award of 29 June 1989, § 135 (Exh. CL-157), referring to:
American International (“{lJt is well established that the Tribunal must exclude from its

Claimant's property or from any prior threats or actions by the Respondents related thereto”).

hence, valueless”.®'5 This is allegedly so because a hypothetical willing buyer would
be placed in the same position as Burlington, whose Subsidiaries “have waived the
possibility of ever refiling their claims under the Participation Contracts in any form in
the future”.°"® According to Ecuador, any willing buyer would thus be barred from
enforcing the right to be indemnified against the effects of Law 42.°'7

The Tribunal cannot agree. First, while the Tribunal held that “the Burlington
Subsidiaries have waived the possibility of ever re-filing their claims under the PSCs
in any form in the future”, it also considered that “[t]hey have not waived the
underlying rights and Burlington may thus rely on these underlying rights to pursue
its Treaty claims in this arbitration’.®'® Accordingly, these underlying rights must be
considered when valuing Burlington's expropriated investment.

Second and more importantly, as the standard of compensation is full reparation,
the Tribunal must value what Burlington lost as a result of the expropriation. What
Burlington lost was a contract with a full set of rights, each of which must be given
its value. While the Parties agree that the Tribunal must search for the FMV of these
rights, the Tribunal is not bound by the “willing buyer-willing seller” analogy. This
analogy is only a tool to calculate the FMV of the expropriated investment, to be
used if and when it helps to appropriately quantify the investor’s loss. As Burlington
argued at the Hearing, as a result of the expropriation, Burlington did not lose an
opportunity to sell its contract rights; it lost an opportunity to exercise them.*'? The
relevant question is thus not whether a hypothetical buyer would have paid full value
for the PSCs, it is what value Burlington would have derived from exercising the
rights under the PSCs, but for their expropriation.

The Occidental II tribunal adopted a similar reasoning. When addressing Ecuador’s
argument that future cash flows should take into account the effect of Law 42, that
tribunal concluded that this argument “suffer[ed] from a fundamental flaw” because
the relevant test was not what a hypothetical buyer would pay under the current
circumstances, but rather what the claimants had lost:

370.

“It is obvious that a hypothetical third party would not pay more than

would be justified by the prospective returns on an investment, and

that Law 42 would have to figure in an assessment of these returns

(either because of the risk of its continued application or because

Ecuador would insist on this as a pre-condition to authorization). But

asking what a hypothetical investor would pay under Law 42 which

the Tribunal has found to be in breach of the Participation Contract is

irrelevant to assessing what OEPC, whose contract protected it

against things like Law 42, has actually lost. To reiterate, the test is

not “what would a hypothetical buyer pay in the circumstances as

they are now”; the test is “what have the Claimants lost.” The fair

market value is a guide to answering this question, but what must be

calculated is the discounted cash flow value of the Participation

Contract (i.e. Block 15) excluding breaches of it (i.e. Law 42) by the

Respondent”.®°
For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Burlington’s lost profits claim must be
valued assuming compliance by Ecuador with its contractual obligations under the
PSCs, in particular its tax absorption obligations. As the Tribunal discusses further
below, this means that the effect of Law 42 must be ignored when calculating the
production values that give rise to the projected cash flows on the basis of which

Burlington’s damages are quantified.

5. | Computation of cash flows

Having determined that the proper valuation methodology is the DCF method, the
Tribunal must now compute Burlington's lost cash flows. To this effect, it will first
refer to the Updated Model (Section 5.1). It will then examine the variables and
assumptions proposed by the Parties to compute those lost cash flows (Section
5.2). Thereafter, it will address the distinction between past and future cash flows,
including the relevant actualization or discount rate applicable to each (Section 5.3).
It will then address the sequence of the DCF analysis (Section 5.4) and end with the
computation of the lost cash flows, for which it has relied on the Updated Model
(Section 5.5).

5.1. The Updated Model

To compute Burlington’s lost (past and future) cash flows, the Tribunal has relied on
the Joint Valuation Model (the “Model”) provided by the Parties’ damages experts.
The Model was prepared jointly by Compass Lexecon and Fair Links pursuant to the

Occidental v. Ecuador II, Award of 5 October 2012, § 539 (Exh. CL-240). The Tribunal notes
that this part of the Occidental tribunal's reasoning was not affected by the partial annulment
(See: Occidental v. Ecuador, Decision on Annulment of 2 November 2015, § 590(1) and (2)).

Tribunal’s invitation and specifications in PO29.%' Specifically, the Tribunal
requested the experts jointly to prepare a valuation model allowing it to choose
between the different variables proposed by the Parties for the computation of cash
flows as specified by the Tribunal. The experts submitted a first version of the
Model, together with an explanatory memorandum, on 24 April 2015. On the
Tribunal’s invitation,®** the experts updated the Model on 20 September 2016 (the
“Updated Model”), again with a joint explanatory memorandum (the “Joint
Memorandum”). The Parties provided their comments to the Updated Model on 4
October 2016.

Burlington essentially agrees with the Updated Model.*?° Ecuador, by contrast, has
expressed certain reservations as to the accuracy and reliability of the model. It
emphasizes that it fundamentally disagrees with some of the technical and legal
assumptions upon which the model is based. It is also concerned about the caveats
set out by the experts in their Joint Memorandum. Accordingly, “[g]iven the
numerous limitations inherent in the Updated Model, Ecuador urges the Tribunal to
exercise the utmost caution in the reliance it may place on said Model for quantum
purposes”.°4

The Tribunal cannot accept Ecuador’s suggestion that the Updated Model is flawed
because it contains legal and technical assumptions with which Ecuador disagrees.
By definition, a joint valuation model must contain each side’s legal and technical
assumptions, regardless of their merit. It is then for the Tribunal to choose the ones
which it considers well-founded to carry out its computation.

The Tribunal notes that the experts jointly stated that they “agree with the
functionalities, computations and calculations of the Joint Model based on the
options that were put to us by the Tribunal, where feasible (not all the Tribunal’s
requests could be implemented)”.®° That said, the Tribunal has reviewed the
caveats raised by the experts in their Joint Memorandum (most of which refer to
functionalities that could not be implemented and thus require approximations)®>

and Ecuador's specific objections. Given the Tribunal’s choices below, some of
these caveats become moot, and the Tribunal addresses those that are still relevant
in the context of its discussion of the pertinent variable.

5.2 Variables and assumptions for cash flows

The Tribunal will start with the production profile (Section 5.2.1), followed by crude
oil prices (Section 5.2.2), operating expenditures (Section 5.2.3), capital
expenditures (Section 5.2.4), and taxation (5.2.5).

5.2.1. Production profile
a. __ Burlington’s position

Compass Lexecon values Burlington’s investment “in a hypothetical scenario where
Ecuador complied with its legal obligations regarding the tax absorption”.©” It
explains that “[iJn such a scenario, [Burlington] would have had economic incentive
to invest in new drilling, which, according to [Burlington], and as described by Mr.
Crick, would have resulted in additional production from new wells beginning in
December 2007 for Block 7, and January 2008 for Block 21. Consequently,
[Burlington’s] investment and production profile would have differed from what has
been actually observed in both Block 7 and Block 21 from 2007 onwards”.®°

According to Burlington, it would be improper to rely on a production profile based
on actual investment on the date of the expropriation, as actual production was
diminished by Ecuador's unlawful value-depressing measures. Messrs. Martinez
and Crick confirmed that Ecuador's failure to absorb the 50% tax affected the
incentive to further invest.®° With the 99% tax, “the viability of any further
investment was wiped out”, and by the end of 2007, all investment ceased.*°
Accordingly, actual production was “far lower” than in the but-for scenario. Had
Ecuador absorbed the tax, the Consortium would have had “the economic incentive
to continue” investing.®"

As a result, Burlington argues that it is entitled “to compensation representing the
present value of the incremental production that it would have generated from
December 2007 onwards, had Ecuador’s unlawful actions not forced the Consortium
to curtail, then cease, its investment”. Burlington further stresses that it only seeks
damages for “the decrease in investment and resulting production from December
2007 onwards” (i.e. after imposition of 99%, not from April 2006 onwards with the
50% tax).

Compass Lexecon relies on the projections of production volume found in Mr.
Crick’s witness statements.** Mr. Crick’s witness statements forecast how much oil
would have been produced by the Consortium from the oilfields in Blocks 7 and 21
had the Consortium been permitted to continue operations through the end of each
Block’s contract term (8 June 2021 for Block 21 and 16 August 2010 for Block 7).®%°
In making these forecasts, Mr. Crick assumes that Ecuador complied with its
obligations under the PSCs.®6

Mr. Crick calculated the lost production volumes on the basis of the number of wells
in existence at the time of dispossession, as well as the incremental wells that would
have been drilled “but for” the taking.°°” He then applied a “production/decline rate”
to both sets of wells to determine the number of barrels of oil that the wells would
produce.®* More specifically:

i. With respect to existing wells, Mr. Crick’s production analysis relied on actual oil
production data drawn both from Perenco records and the records produced by
Ecuador.®° Where appropriate, Mr. Crick extended the wells’ production values
into the future using standard engineering techniques.

7 contract would have been extended to August 2018, which is relied on by Compass

With respect to incremental wells, Mr. Crick explains that the Consortium’s
program of additional investment reflects what a reasonable and prudent
investor would have invested unconstrained by Ecuador’s breaches.*' After
determining the number of incremental wells that the Consortium would have
drilled in each Block, Mr. Crick applied “a reasonable drilling schedule for that
Block that takes into account Perenco’s historical practices, its financial
capabilities, and the equipment that would have been available to it’. He then
forecasted production for the new wells using data ranging from seismic
information to actual production data from the existing wells. Mr. Crick adopted
different approaches for his calculations depending on the field characteristics
(for instance, for Oso, the actual production and decline rates; and for Lobo and
CPUF, water injection simulations).°°

Mr. Crick concludes that, but for the expropriation and ignoring the effects of Law

42, the Consortium would have produced 17.7 million barrels of oil from Block 7
from December 2007 to August 2010 (the scheduled expiry of the Block 7 PSC), as
follows:®4

The production from existing wells (68 at the time of the expropriation)®*®
between December 2007 and August 2010 would have been 4.3 million barrels
of oil. This was the actual volume produced by Petroamazonas from existing
wells in that period and Mr. Crick assumes that Perenco would have produced
the same amount.”

With respect to production from incremental wells, Mr. Crick explains that “[i]f
Perenco had not been granted an extension it would have continued the
programme of drilling on Oso, by far the largest and most important project on
Block 7”, at a rate of one well per month, but would have stopped any new

Mem., 87, referring to: Crick WS1, 495, 9-10; as well as Martinez WS4 Supp., 7.
Crick WS1, 16.
Mem., 4 168.

Mr. Crick also provides a forecast for Block 7 in an extension scenario. However, as the
Tribunal has rejected this head of claim it will disregard this forecast for reasons of
procedural efficiency.

According to: Compass Lexecon ER1, § 40.

investments one year before the end of the contract.®® Mr. Crick thus calculates
that 21 additional wells would have been drilled in Block 7, specifically in the
Oso field, from December 2007 until August 2009, resulting in 13.4 million
barrels for the 21 new wells. To calculate production from these new wells,

 

Mr. Crick used a correlation for the initial rate and then a decline curve based
on a type curve derived from the existing wells.

According to Mr. Crick, this timeline and forecast are reasonable, which is confirmed
by Petroamazonas’ actual drilling and production since the expropriation.®' Mr.
Crick notes in particular that the 2013 Ryder Scott Reserves Report®?
“demonstrates that Petroamazonas is planning to drill far more wells at Oso than
were contemplated in the 2008 Perenco development plan, and projects total
recoverable oil volumes higher than what [Mr. Crick] predicted in the 2018 extension
case”.°3 By June 2013, Petroamazonas had drilled 88 wells in the Oso field (the
first 21 in just 18 months),®* and had stated that it would drill 110 more. In
addition, Petroamazonas’ Year-End Report for 2013 indicates that there are 761
million barrels of oil in place, which is over four times Perenco’s estimate in 2008
(175 million barrels). Mr. Crick concludes that “Block 7's Oso field was a very
good field that just kept getting better, and it would have been drilled aggressively,
just as Petroamazonas is doing now”.®°”

the Block 7 PSC been extended until 2018, yielding a further 105.8 million barrels (for a total
forecast of 125.7 million) (Reply, 9 134, 182; Crick WS1, 9§ 145-148, as revised by Crick

With respect to Block 21, Mr. Crick forecasts that, “but for” the expropriation and
Law 42, the Consortium would have produced a total of 37.9 million barrels of oil
as follows:

i. With respect to existing wells, Mr. Crick forecasts the production of the 33 wells
in place in the Yuralpa field on the date of the expropriation®* on the basis of
their historical production until August 2009, as well as Petroamazonas’ actual
production data.®©° Mr. Crick initially prepared his forecast on the basis of type-
curve analysis. According to Mr. Crick, the actual performance of the wells
drilled by Perenco shows an initial 43% well production decline that stabilized at
9%, which is confirmed by the actual performance of the wells drilled by
Petroamazonas.®' On that basis, Mr. Crick calculated that total recovery from
existing wells in Block 21 until June 2021 would be 25.7 million barrels. °?

ii. With respect to incremental wells, Mr. Crick starts by explaining that “[b]y the
end of March 2013 the Main Hollin in Yuralpa had produced 35.2 million barrels,
only 10% of the original oil in place” which “confirms the low volumetric sweep
efficiency of the present wells and implies that many more new wells are
needed to properly drain the reservoir’. After discounting the fringe of the
reservoir (which Perenco did not expect to develop due to its low oil thickness),
“the volume of oil originally considered developable is reduced to 246 million

14.3% of the developable oil’, which is low, showing that “there is still a

Mr. Crick explains that the Yuralpa field is the only producing field in Block 21 (Crick WS1, §
32). He further explains that by the time Perenco ceased drilling there were 32 wells able to
produce and 31 wells actually producing. Crick WS { 98; see also: Figures 9 and 11, Crick

Crick WS2, J 11-36. Dr. Strickland explains that type curve analysis “plots the oil rate
against time for multiple wells on the same plot. The time reflected on the x-axis is usually
displayed as months since the date of first production rather than time as a calendar date.
Thus, in this type of plot, all wells start at the same time (0) regardless of the calendar date
on which each well was drilled. At each point in time, the average rate of all wells combined
is calculated. Mr. Crick used this average to develop his rates of decline for future well
production” (Strickland ER, § 46).

tremendous amount of undrained oil in place”. Mr. Crick forecasts that the
Consortium would have drilled a further 24 wells until 2021 but for Ecuador's
unlawful conduct, 21 of which would have consisted of “in fill’ drilling (i.e.,
drilling that “filled in” the areas of unrecovered oil between existing wells) in the
center of the reservoir (the 1900 acre area with an oil column greater than 90
feet), and 3 additional wells outside that area. Mr. Crick assumes a drilling
rate of one well per month (which is consistent with Perenco’s historical drilling
rate),°°” starting in January 2008%* and ending in December 2009. Again
relying initially on type-curve analysis, and using the empirical data on average
initial production and decline rates,®”° Mr. Crick projects that the Consortium
would have recovered an additional 12.2 million barrels from these 24 wells®”'
(which, added to the 25.7 million barrels from existing wells, results in a total
production forecast of 37.9 million barrels).°”

Mr. Crick used four different methods to forecast oil production in the Yuralpa field:
(i) type-curve analysis; (ii) individual decline-curve analysis of existing wells (his
initial methodology); (iii) the Yuralpa full-field simulation model made in 2007, and
(iv) the same model, updated with data to July 2009 and modified to match
performance per date.®”? The results of these four methods essentially concur.°”
Mr. Crick explains that type-curve analysis is more reliable than well-by-well analysis
because, as a result of the poor behavior of some wells, reviewing their history on

Crick WS1, 9§ 102-107.

Mr. Crick explains that Perenco stopped drilling in Yuralpa on 10 February 2007 mainly
because of the uncertainty and economic penalty created by Law 42, but he does not
assume continuous drilling on Block 21. Rather, because Perenco was already conducting a
field study to better understand the nature of the reservoir, Mr. Crick assumes that Perenco
would have stopped drilling in February 2007, waited for the results of the study, and
recommenced drilling on 1 January 2008. /d., §§ 103-104.

Mr. Crick explains that the 24 new wells would have taken two years to drill, and while
“[aldditional wells may well have been profitable beyond these, [...] it is difficult to predict
how much oil would remain for such wells once the appropriate pump upgrades and water
shut-offs had been implemented”. As a result, he assumed no drilling in the Yuralpa field
after December 2009. /d., § 107.

As summarized by Dr. Strickland, Mr. Crick’s recovery forecast for future wells “was based
on (1) the initial oil rate (known for existing wells, and projected for new wells); and (2) the
average production decline rate” (Strickland ER, § 45).

an individual basis is not a good predictor of the future. By contrast, type-curve
analysis looks for constants in well behavior, which allows for better prediction. In
particular, it clearly shows a 9% decline rate after 36 to 40 months, whether one
looks at the performance between 2003 and 2004 or between 2006 and 2007.°’5

Mr. Crick regards his forecast for Block 21 as conservative and reasonable for at
least four reasons: (i) 21 of the 24 wells are located in a proven oil producing area
and are 1P wells;°’ (ii) his forecast assumes that Perenco stopped drilling in
February 2007 and did not resume until 1 January 2008°’’ when, in reality, but for
Law 42 the drilling would have been continuous;*” (iii) his recovery rate is at the low
end of the spectrum;®’? and (iv) the data received from Ecuador confirms the
reasonableness of the drilling plan: by 2013, Petroamazonas’ had already drilled 8
new wells and redrilled 3 in the Yuralpa field,®° but the 2013 Ryder Scott Reserves
Report shows that Petroamazonas intended to drill 28 new wells in the Yuralpa field
(a total of 36 new wells in Yuralpa after July 2009, compared to the 24 new wells
forecasted by Mr. Crick).°'

It arises from the foregoing that Burlington’s total “but for” production forecast (i-e.,
freed from the effects of Law 42) is as follows:

i. Block 7 (according to its original term) would have yielded an ultimate recovery
of 17.7 million barrels (4.3 + 13.4 million barrels).

See: note 668 above.

Mr. Crick explains that, according to a 2008 study by Denis Beliveau, the expected ultimate
recovery factor for 27 viscous oil reservoirs such as Yuralpa ranged between 15% and 52%,
and his recovery factor for the Main Hollin in Yuralpa including the proposed new wells is
15.5%. Crick WS2, J§ 9, 157-161, Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 379:16-380:15 (Direct,

the further wells proposed by Petroamazonas to be ‘proved’ (1P) locations, a further four
wells to be ‘probable’ (2P), and six additional sites as ‘possible’ (3P). Given that
Petroamazonas had already drilled eight new wells after taking over operations from
Perenco (together with three re-drills), this makes a total of 36 additional wells proposed or
drilled by Petroamazonas in Yuralpa field after July 2009, compared to the 24 new wells

Burlington Correctly Forecasts “But For” Oil Production

37-6 million 17.4million 125.4 million
arrels barrels arrels

The Tribunal thus understands that Burlington has amended its forecasted
production volumes, or at least limits its submissions as regards those volumes, to a
total of 37.6 million barrels for Block 21 and 17.4 million barrels for Block 7 (in a no
extension scenario).

Burlington argues that Mr. Crick’s forecast is reasonable, technically sound, and
accurate, as it has been confirmed by Ecuador's own data.

Burlington first contends that Mr. Crick’s drilling forecasts are reasonable. This is
because (i) the Blocks’ performance under Petroamazonas confirms that the only
reason that Burlington stopped drilling was Ecuador's failure to absorb the impact of
Law 42; (ii) the evidence otherwise shows that the Consortium would have drilled
more wells but for Ecuador’s unlawful conduct, and (iii) the new wells forecasted by
Mr. Crick would have been profitable. Specifically:

i. With respect to (i), Burlington observes that Petroamazonas, which is not
subject to Law 42, has undertaken a successful drilling and production program
that is very similar to the one forecasted by Mr. Crick for a scenario in which
Ecuador honors its obligation to absorb the economic impact of Law 42.° This
proves that, had Ecuador honored its tax absorption obligations, the Consortium
would have continued drilling. Indeed, Ecuador's failure to absorb the impact of
Law 42 was the only reason why the Consortium stopped drilling. Contrary to

Reply, 142.

147

Ecuador's contentions, the 9 October 2007 email from Jim Johnson,®* then
Partnership Operations Manager at Burlington, does not prove that the
Consortium believed that all drilling on Blocks 7 and 21 would still be economic
under Law 42 at 99%; that email clearly refers only to the drilling of four wells in
the Oso field in Block 7, which was still considered economic because the
Consortium had already paid to drill these wells (making them sunk costs), and
Block 7 benefitted from a higher reference price.®® If anything, that email shows
that the Consortium was hesitant to continue drilling, as Mr. Johnson
recommended that Burlington drill only the next programmed well on Oso, “and
then watch the situation and make decisions on the remaining wells based on
what happens in the country”.®°°

With respect to (ii), Ecuador's claim that, even absent Law 42, the Consortium
would in any event not have continued drilling in the Blocks is incorrect.
Burlington’s witnesses confirm that, had Ecuador not breached the PSCs, the
Consortium would have continued drilling.*' While Mr. Crick’s drilling
projections reflect Perenco’s proposed investment plan, Mr. Martinez confirmed
that Burlington would have supported this investment plan had Ecuador
honored its obligations under the PSCs.°°? More specifically:

a. Mr. Crick confirmed that the Consortium planned to continue developing
Block 21 despite the fact that the wells drilled in the first few years of
operation had produced less than expected.®°? Instead of abandoning the
field, Mr. Crick explains that the Consortium stopped drilling in 2006 and
undertook a major study to better understand the reservoir’s behavior.°*
Ecuador's claim that the Consortium stopped drilling in Block 21 because
it believed that it was fully developed is incorrect. The documents on
which Ecuador relies (specifically, the January 2007 Yuralpa Mapping
Update,°> the May 2007 Latin American Reserves Review, the

Committee Meeting Presentation,®°® and the Yuralpa Field Upper and

damages in the proper “but for’ scenario, because they reflect the impact
of Law 42 on the Consortium’s business plans.”°° In any event, Ecuador
and RPS take these documents out of context: properly interpreted, these
documents prove that only Law 42 caused the Consortium to stop
drilling.’°' Finally, Mr. Crick asserts that there is no evidence of an open or
extensive natural fracture network in the Yuralpa field; to the contrary, the
evidence suggests that no such fracturing exists or that the permeability of
existing fractures is such that their behavior is the same as that of the
reservoir rock.’ In Mr. Crick’s opinion, the cause for the water
breakthrough in the Yuralpa wells is water coning, which means that the
oil between the water cones may be extracted through in-fill drilling,
providing additional reserves.”

Ecuador's claim that the Consortium stopped drilling on Block 7 due to

 

concerns about reservoir quality is equally unfounded. The documents on
which Ecuador relies (specifically, the May 2007 Latin American Reserves
Review,’ the 2007 ConocoPhillips Sales Memorandum,’ and the 9
October 2007 email from Mr. Johnson)’ actually prove that the

iii. With respect to (iii), Compass Lexecon has run a profitability test” on
Mr. Crick’s production forecasts from late 2007 onwards and concludes that, but
for Ecuador's failure to absorb the impact of Law 42, Mr. Crick’s 24 proposed
new wells on Block 21 would have yielded USD 134 million in profits, while the
21 new wells for Block 7 (in the non-extension case) would have yielded
USD 294 million.”°°

Burlington further argues that Mr. Crick’s “but for” production forecast is technically
sound, as is confirmed by Dr. Strickland’s independent assessment. Using different

 

forecasting techniques, Dr. Strickland reaches very similar conclusions about the
future performance of the Blocks, proving that Mr. Crick’s forecasting methods and
conclusions are accurate and reliable.’"° Specifically with respect to Block 21,
Dr. Strickland confirmed that (a) the conditions for drilling on the Main Hollin are
good (the reservoir is fed by strong underground aquifer providing enough pressure
to extract oil, and the soil has a sufficient porosity to allow oil flow), (b) the wells still
perform economically in case of water coning, (c) the best way to extract further oil
was through in-fill drilling (decreasing space between wells from 70 to 40 acres),”"
(d) contrary to RPS’ claim, the Main Hollin reservoir is not fractured,’'* and (e) the
use of “type curves” of existing wells by Mr. Crick to determine future production is
more appropriate than the well-by-well analysis employed by RPS.’'> Finally,
Dr. Strickland also confirmed Mr. Crick’s production forecasts for new wells in
Block 21.74

More importantly, in addition to being reasonable and technically sound, Burlington
submits that Mr. Crick’s forecast is accurate, as it has been confirmed by
Petroamazonas’ actual production data and Ryder Scott’s report providing reserves

projections which had been commissioned by Petroamazonas.’'® The Ryder Scott
Reserves Report indeed shows that the ultimate recovery possible from the Blocks
is in line with Mr. Crick’s estimate: in June 2013, Ryder Scott calculated that the total
proven and probable reserves of oil that could be recovered from Block 21 was
60 million barrels, while Mr. Crick’s estimate was only marginally higher at 63 million
barrels.’'® Similarly, Ryder Scott's calculation of total proven and probable reserves
for Block 7 (230 million barrels) is higher than Mr. Crick’s estimate (205 million
barrels).’"” This is reflected in Slide 101 of Burlington’s Closing Presentation at the

393.

By contrast, Burlington argues that RPS’s predictions must be rejected, for the

following reasons:

RPS’s forecast is fundamentally flawed because it relies on the incorrect
assumption that the Consortium would have been subject to the full effects of
Law 42. This assumption invalidates RPS’s entire forecast as it is premised on
a reduced investment and drilling program that does not correspond to the
applicable “but for” scenario.’'® In particular, RPS wrongly assumes no new
wells in Block 7 due to the effects of Law 42.719

RPS’s opinion that, by August 2009, Block 21 was “fully developed” and that
additional wells would have only accelerated production of existing reserves is
wrong.”2° Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland, through the use of different forecasting
techniques, confirm that the Main Hollin reservoir still had large quantities of
oil.”2" Mr. Crick gives four reasons why RPS’s conclusion in this respect is
wrong: (a) the wells drilled by Petroamazonas in 2011-2012 have produced new
reserves’ (the Tribunal understands this to mean that the wells have allowed
Petroamazonas to discover reserves previously unknown): (b) RPS’s recovery
factor for Yuralpa is unreasonably low (10.5%, when the minimum considered in
the Beliveau study is 15%), and is based on a flawed calculation of initial oil in
place;’* (c) RPS’s opinion is founded on a “misguided interpretation of the
2007 study and model of the Yuralpa field”,’* and (d) as noted at (iii) below, the
Ryder Scott Reserves Report shows reserves that are much higher than those
used by RPS and more new wells than those proposed by Mr. Crick.” This is
confirmed by the fact that Mr. Daigre of RPS conceded at the Hearing that
Block 21 was in fact not fully developed in August 2009.76

More importantly, RPS’s projections have been proven wrong by
Petroamazonas’ actual figures. Mr. Crick explains that “[als of 2014,
Petroamazonas has already produced more oil from Block 21 than RPS’s
forecasts say the Block was capable of producing through 2021”, which means
that Petroamazonas is currently producing reserves that RPS believed do not
exist.’2” Indeed, by July 2014, the wells on Block 21 had produced more than
41 million barrels of oil and were still producing new reserves.’ This proves
that RPS'’s production forecast of 11.24 million barrels by the end of the
Block 21 PSC and of an ultimate recovery of 39 million barrels was obviously
incorrect.’° At the Hearing, RPS conceded that actual data had proven its
forecast to be incorrect.”°° Although RPS persists in stating that the drilling
program was a failure since “the wells only accelerated production from existing
wells”,’5' the evidence in fact shows that reserves have increased year after
year for the past three years, despite continuous production,”* a fact that
Mr. Daigre also conceded.’°*

The differences between RPS’s ultimate recovery projections for Block 21 and those
of Mr. Crick, Dr. Strickland, Ryder Scott and Petroamazonas are illustrated in the

Finally, Burlington argues that Ecuador's excuses for RPS’s failed forecast should
be disregarded. Ecuador cannot blame the inaccuracy of RPS’s forecast on the fact
that it used pre-expropriation data, because Mr. Crick checked his Block 21 forecast
against three alternative methods that were based solely on pre-expropriation data,
and concluded that they confirmed his original forecast.”° Nor can RPS argue that
Petroamazonas is not an appropriate proxy for the Consortium: like the Consortium,
Petroamazonas is a prudent operator which operates the Blocks with a profit-
maximizing motive.”°’ Further, while it is true that Petroamazonas would have
obtained 100% of the proceeds of the fields and the Consortium only 70-80%,
Compass Lexecon confirmed (on the basis of profitability tests) that “the net crude
oil prices that the Consortium would have received in the ‘but for’ scenario were high
enough for the Consortium to have drilled and produced at least at the same level
as Petroamazonas”.’* The evidence also suggests that the Consortium would have
pursued a drilling strategy similar to the one of Petroamazonas. For instance, it
would have also developed the fringe area of the field, and given the duration
remaining on the Block 21 PSC, it would have had the time to refine its drilling
strategy.”°°

For the reasons set out above, Burlington submits that the Tribunal should use
Mr. Crick’s production forecast to calculate cash flows.

b.  Ecuador’s position

Ecuador strongly objects to Compass Lexecon’s valuation of production volumes.
According to Ecuador, Compass Lexecon’s calculation of these production volumes
is flawed for three main reasons:

i. Compass Lexecon’s valuation relies on the production forecasts estimated by
Mr. Crick, which Ecuador characterizes as “unrealistic, technically flawed, and

accelerated”.’4°

ii. Ecuador alleges that “in a DCF valuation as performed by Compass Lexecon,
the earlier years of the model are the most valuable ones (because less
impacted by the discount rate), which gives an incentive to Burlington and
Perenco to accelerate production as much as possible in the earlier years to
increase the net present value of the Block 7”.”' This is compounded by the
fact that Compass Lexecon is applying an exaggerated actualization rate of
12.1% to bring past cash flows to the valuation date, which gives Burlington and
Perenco a further incentive to boost production in 2007 and 2008.74?

iii. Compass Lexecon artificially inflates the significance of production volumes by
applying value drivers in the calculation of FMV in an incorrect order (i.e.,
applying Law 42 and the actualization rate at the outset, instead of at the
end).”° The Tribunal addresses this argument of Ecuador in Section VII.D.5.2.6
below.

By contrast, Fair Links applies the proper DCF methodology and production profile.
Fair Links modelled three different production scenarios “in order to reflect a full
understanding of the level of production a willing buyer would have expected””* for
Blocks 7 and 21, specifically (i) a base case building on RPS’s production profile, (ii)
a low case (20% lower than RPS), and (iii) and a high case (20% and 15% higher
than RPS in Blocks 21 and 7 respectively).’4°

For its base case, Fair Links relied on RPS’s forecast, according to which the
Consortium would have produced the following volumes but for the expropriation:

i. With respect to Block 7, RPS forecasts that the Consortium would have

 

produced 3.61 million barrels of oil from Block 7 from 30 August 2009 until the
PSC’s scheduled termination on 16 August 2010.”4° RPS’s forecast is based on
the historical production performance of the wells through August 2009, which is
consistent with what a willing buyer would have done. RPS also considers that

the Block 7 PSC would not have been renewed”’ and, given the proximity of
the expiry date (one year from the date of the expropriation), no new drilling
would have been performed. 748

ii. With respect to Block 21, RPS assessed that the Consortium would have
produced 11.24 million barrels of oil after 30 August 2009 until the termination
of the Block 21 PSC (8 June 2021).”° RPS reaches this figure by projecting the
Block’s historical performance into the future, assuming no new drilling. This is
because in RPS’s opinion the Yuralpa field was fully developed by February
2007 and “[flurther drilling would have resulted in accelerated recovery of the
remaining reserves, but no new reserves would have been added”.”5°

RPS's production and reserves estimates are summarized in the following table:”°'

Remaining Reserves by Field and Block (barrels)
As of 31 August 2009

 

724

In Ecuador’s view, RPS used the correct methodology and assumptions to calculate
its production profiles:

i. Instructed to adopt the view of a willing buyer on the date of the expropriation
and to consider the effects of Law 42, RPS “disregarded events after 30 August

Because Ecuador objects to Burlington’s extension scenario for Block 7, it instructed RPS
not to draw a production profile for that scenario. Rejoinder, J 689.

2009 that could not have been anticipated by a willing buyer/seller at the

time”.752

RPS conducted a well-by-well analysis, in which it analyzed the performance of
every well and prepared 1P and 2P forecasts for all of the wells that were
producing as of August 2009. Contrary to Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland, “RPS did
not create any new ‘evidence’ to support its analyses and conclusions, such as
the ‘simple’ simulation models the Burlington witnesses have created to show
‘evidence’ of water coning. RPS merely reviewed the production data and the
related documents and presentations prepared by the Consortium, including 3rd
party engineering studies commissioned by it, in the full context of the time in
question, 2006-2009”.759

RPS used a 25% decline curve, which would have been conservative even
using post-expropriation data.”>*

RPS applied a Reserves Adjustment Factor (“RAF”) to account for the different
uncertainty levels of proven and probable reserves, as well as whether those
reserves are developed or undeveloped.’®> Mr. Crick’s failure to apply a RAF to
developed reserves is misconceived because, as RPS explains, “willing buyers
of oil and gas assets recognize that there is uncertainty in reserves estimates.
As a result, prospective buyers apply adjustments based on several factors
including, but not limited to, reserve classifications of Proved, Probable and
Possible and whether or not the reserves are Developed or Undeveloped”.’5°

By contrast, Ecuador opposes Mr. Crick’s production forecast. Ecuador and RPS

advance the following general criticisms of those forecasts:

The proper valuation date from the perspective of a willing buyer is the date of
Ecuador's intervention in the Blocks, 30 August 2009. This means that the only
new wells that could be considered for valuation purposes are those that would

404.

have been drilled from that date onwards. As a result, any predicted drilling that
predates 30 August 2009 should be discarded outright.’°”

To support his incremental drilling forecast starting from December 2007,
Mr. Crick wrongly assumes that Law 42 has no impact. Law 42 should not be
disregarded and, as Burlington has forever waived its contractual right to be
indemnified against the effects of Law 42, this right is valueless. As a result, “it
is wrong to assume as Mr. Crick does that additional investment would have
been made from the proceeds of indemnification for the effects of Law 42”.758

Mr. Crick wrongly relies on post-expropriation data, including Petroamazonas’
actual production data and Ryder Scott's 2011 and 2013 reserves certification
reports. This information would neither have been available nor foreseeable to a
willing buyer at the time of the expropriation.”° In any event, as explained
further below, Petroamazonaas is not the correct proxy for the Consortium.

Finally, Burlington has failed to prove that the Consortium stopped drilling only
because of the impact of Law 42. As explained in more detail below, Burlington
has failed to establish with certainty which incremental wells would have been
drilled “but for Law 42 at 99%” (which was the test enunciated in Burlington's
Memorial on Quantum),”©° as opposed to those which it would have drilled but
for Law 42 at 50%.

More specifically, Ecuador and RPS criticize Mr. Crick’s production forecast for

Block 7 (in the non-extension scenario)’*' for the following reasons:

 

Mr. Crick assumes that the Consortium stopped drilling because of the impact
of Law 42. This is false: the 9 October 2007 email from Mr. Johnson shows that
Burlington considered that drilling in the Oso field would have been profitable

CM, 436.

Rejoinder, § 705.

R-PHB, 287-288, referring to: Mem., p. 44, note 127.

Ecuador also objects to Mr. Crick’s projection for the extension scenario, but as it argues that
Burlington would not have obtained an extension, it limits its discussion to Mr. Crick’s non-
extension case (CM, § 433). That being said, in RPS’s view, Burlington's extension forecast
is “completely unsupported” and is contradicted by the documents produced by Burlington.
See: RPS ER3, Section 5.3.4.

159

even with Law 42 at 99%. Burlington’s argument that the Consortium faced a
great deal of uncertainty at the time does not change this conclusion.’°2

Mr. Crick’s drilling schedule for the 21 incremental wells is “overly aggressive
(thereby artificially increasing production in the earlier years) and not
corroborated by the Consortium’s contemporaneous documents”.’® Relying on
the 2006 Oso Development Plan’® (which was approved in March 2007) and
on the 2007 ConocoPhillips Sales Memorandum,’ Ecuador argues that the
Consortium planned to drill a maximum of 8 new wells (plus 8 contingent wells,
subject to agreement with Ecuador) before the expiry of the Block 7 PSC.’
This limited drilling plan was due to two factors: (a) the reservoirs in Block 7 are
difficult to characterize and, as a result, the performance of the wells in the Oso
field is more uncertain than Mr. Crick implies,”°” and (b) the proximity of the
expiry date for the Block 7 PSC.

Mr. Crick’s oil recovery forecasts are “overly optimistic and not technically
sound”,’® both for existing and incremental wells:

a. With respect to existing wells, Ecuador objects to Mr. Crick’s use of
Petroamazonas’ figures. As explained further below, Petroamazonas is
not an appropriate proxy for what the Consortium would have done on
Block 7. In addition, the favorable actual crude prices used by Compass
Lexecon could not have been anticipated by a willing buyer in August
2009.77

b. With respect to incremental wells, Ecuador argues that Mr. Crick’s
forecasts are partly based on “average well curves” using a flawed
methodology. Mr. Crick obtained these average well curves by dividing
the total monthly production by the number of wells producing each

month, which results in a higher average, and selectively included only the
wells that would result in higher production. The use of this methodology
is also problematic as total fluid production rates change throughout the
life of each well.?”"

c. Mr. Crick did not apply a RAF to his projections, which is necessary to
quantify the uncertainty in the reserves forecasts. This results in an
artificially inflated production profile.””

Ecuador also criticizes Mr. Crick’s projections for Block 21 for the following reasons:

cM,
cM,

Mr. Crick assumes that the Consortium stopped drilling because of the impact
of Law 42. This is false: internal ConocoPhillips’ documents from 2006 and
2007 show that Burlington would have stopped drilling regardless of the impact
of Law 42. These documents (which include the January 2007 Yuralpa Mapping
Update,” the 2007 Latin American Reserves Review,’ the 2007 Sales
Memorandum,’ the 2007 Budget Committee Meeting Presentation’”° and the
2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study)’”” show that it was the underperformance of
this Block and its geological uncertainty, not Law 42, that caused the
Consortium to stop drilling.’”* Burlington's argument that these documents are
not useful for measuring damages because they reflect the impact of Law 42
should be disregarded, as they “clearly show the information that a willing buyer
would have had access to on 30 August 2009 in order to value the Blocks,
including that Block 21 had performed lower than expected”.’”9

Mr. Crick ignores the historical underperformance of Block 21 and its difficult
geological conditions, in particular the watering out of certain wells.”®° While
Mr. Crick asserts that this is caused by water coning, this theory “ignores and

contradicts the evidence in Consortium and third-party documents strongly
indicating that the source of Yuralpa water production is not water coning, but is
associated with discrete zones of high permeability in this very heterogeneous
Main Hollin reservoir’.’®' Ecuador points out that the 2007 Sales Memorandum
and other documents record the difficulties encountered between 2004 and
2007 (which included the watering out of wells, the difficulty of isolating water
producing intervals, and lower oil production as a result of water
encroachment). According to Ecuador, two studies concluded that the
problems were caused by fracturing, albeit with different conclusions as to the
cause, and confirmed that there were “unpredictable water problems” on Block
21.789 Mr. Crick, however, overlooked the significance of these conclusions.

Mr. Crick’s aggressive well drilling program (according to which 24 additional
wells would be drilled, 21 of which before 30 August 2009) (a) is not
achievable’® and (b) shows an unrealistic profitability:

a. Mr. Crick ignores contemporaneous documents that show that his
proposed drilling program was not achievable. The 2007 Sales
Memorandum identifies only nine sites for potential drilling in Yuralpa.7°>
This figure was revised down in the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation study, 7°
which concluded that “[s]Jeven additional wells was the maximum
advisable to ensure complete field development and avoid drilling
unnecessary wells”,’°” and that first production from the new wells would
have occurred in September 2008, and not February 2008, as Mr. Crick
and Compass Lexecon assume. As a result, a willing buyer in August
2009 would have relied on documents such as these when assigning a
value to the fields.”®° In any event, despite what is stated in the Yuralpa

Simulation Study, RSP believes that the Yuralpa field was fully developed
and new drilling would not have resulted in additional reserves.”

Although Compass Lexecon claims to have run a profitability test on
Mr. Crick’s drilling program, Fair Links has tested Compass Lexecon’s
conclusions by calculating the Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) associated
with that program. Fair Links concludes that Mr. Crick’s production
scenario involves an IRR of 165% for Block 7 and 43% for Block 21,
which far exceed the standard profitability rate of 12% for an oil and gas
investment.’°°

iv. Finally, for Ecuador, Mr. Crick’s forecasting techniques are fundamentally

flawed:

a.

Mr. Crick used aggregated field-level production data to forecast future
production from existing wells, which is contrary to recommended industry
evaluation practice.”*' According to RPS, “fflield-level analysis should only
be cautiously considered reliable when field conditions are not changing
which was not the case for Yuralpa while Perenco operated the field”.’

Mr. Crick used average well curves, which as explained above is
problematic, and in this particular case allows a particular over-performing
well to have a disproportionate impact. Mr. Crick’s use of average decline
rates also ignores that, historically, the average initial/peak rate of the
wells on Block 21 has fallen significantly with each successive drilling
program.’

There is no support for the 9% decline curve used by Mr. Crick, either in
the performance data of the wells in August 2009 or in the post-
expropriation data.7*

Mr. Crick only applies a reserves adjustment factor to take into account
uncertainty to three Yuralpa wells which it identified as 2P wells. This

does not properly account for the uncertainty in the production of the
remaining wells.’%

By contrast, Ecuador maintains that RPS’s projections are “far more reasonable”
than Mr. Crick’s.’° In order to ensure the reasonableness of RPS’s production
profile, Fair Links performed a comparative analysis of the production scenarios
proposed by Mr. Crick and RPS.”%” Specifically, Fair Links compared the production
profiles to (i) the Consortium’s historical production levels up to the expropriation,
and (ii) ConocoPhillips’ internal assessment of the levels of reserves at the Blocks
between 2006 and 2009,”* and came to the following conclusions:

i. When comparing the profiles to historical production levels, Fair Links found
that “whereas RPS expected production levels are in line with historical (pre-
August 2009) data, the forecasts of John Crick are markedly in excess of past
production of Blocks 7 and 21”.79°

ii. When comparing the production profiles to ConocoPhillips’ assessment of the
level of reserves, Fair Links found that RPS’s projections were consistent with
the levels internally assessed by ConocoPhillips, while Mr. Crick’s assessment
was more than three times higher. ConocoPhillips’ internal documents show
that “the estimated levels of proved reserves for Blocks 7 and 21 are stable over
the years”, and “do not show any significant expected increase in reserves
(future oil production) that would result from the drilling of new wells”.®°' Indeed,
RPS’s results are even “more optimistic than what ConocoPhillips would have
itself considered just before the expropriation”.®°2

With respect to Burlington’s argument that Mr. Crick’s forecast has been validated
by Petroamazonas’ own figures, Ecuador contends that Petroamazonas is not an
appropriate proxy for the Consortium’s performance:

CM, 4 469.
Id., 1.476.
Id., 4 471; Fair Links ER2, {§ 66-86.

Fair Links also considered comparing the production scenarios with the actual production
levels achieved by Petroamazonas, but rejected this method, as this would not have been
“comparing like with like”. Fair Links ER3, { 76.

Id., 4 85.

i. As a public company, Petroamazonas is subject to a different tax system and
receives 100% production. Indeed, “contrary to private operators,
Petroamazonas’ main goal is to maximize production for the state, not
profits”,®°> which can only be achieved through heavy investment.
Petroamazonas also has an unlimited time horizon to recoup its investments.
By contrast, “the Consortium was seeking to maximize the return on its
investment for a period limited to the remaining duration of its contract”, and had
to give a share of its production to the state and comply with regulations (such
as Law 42) which reduced its ability to invest in the Blocks.**

ii. “From a purely technical perspective, Petroamazonas and the Consortium
would not have drilled the same wells”.®°> In particular, the Consortium would
not have drilled the 11 wells that Petroamazonas drilled in Yuralpa in 2011 and
2012 because “[a]ll but one of the 11 wells in Petroamazonas’ 2011/ 2012
drilling campaign would have been considered, per the Consortium’s own
benchmarks, ‘low EUR [estimated ultimate recovery] wells.’ Therefore, based
on the Consortium’s own policy, 10 of the 11 wells drilled by Petroamazonas
would not have even been drilled”.®° Nor is it likely that the Consortium would
have drilled in the fringe area of the Main Hollin reservoir, because that entailed
a high degree of risk that Petroamazonas could handle but not the
Consortium.®” For the same reason, Mr. Crick cannot rely on the 2013 Ryder
Scott Report for his production profile, because all of the 28 new wells shown in
the Ryder Scott report are in fringe areas. Mr. Crick made clear that the

Rejoinder, § 743, referring to: RPS ER4, § 282. RPS explains that “the majority of Ryder
Scott undeveloped wells are in locations which the Consortium would not drill. Based on the
2011 Ryder Scott net pay map and Perenco’s 90-foot minimum oil pay criteria for new wells,
the Consortium would not have elected to drill the 21 wells proposed in the southeastern and
southern areas by Petroamazonas and Ryder Scott in the June 2013 Ryder Scott Reserves
report. It is important to note that the additional seven wells proposed by Petroamazonas
and Ryder Scott in the 2013 Ryder Scott report are technically on the “fringe” area of the
developed Main Hollin reservoir and not in the heart of the developed area where most of
Mr. Crick’s ‘infill’ wells would be located”. RPS ER4, § 282.

411.

Consortium’s avoidance of the fringe areas “was a deliberate policy to avoid
drilling wells that might produce very little oil.°°°

Finally, Ecuador objects to the use of Updated Model to forecast production, for the
reasons explained further below.

c. Analysis

The Tribunal’s task is to determine the volume of oil that Burlington would have
produced “but for” the expropriation. In doing so, the Tribunal will rely on its prior
legal determinations.

i. First, the standard of compensation is full reparation. The goal is to determine
what Burlington would have produced (and sold) “but for” the expropriation, not
what a willing buyer would have paid for Burlington’s oil assets on the date of
the expropriation.

ii. Second, a majority of the Tribunal has also found that, to award full reparation,
the assets must be valued as at the date of the award (or its closest proxy). As
a result, it is appropriate to rely on post-expropriation information, as Mr. Crick
has done.

iii. Third, the Tribunal has found that the impact of Law 42 must be disregarded. In
other words, when projecting Burlington’s cash flows in the counterfactual
world, it must be assumed that Ecuador complies with its tax absorption
obligations, thereby eliminating the impact of Law 42 on Burlington’s production.

It follows that RPS’s calculations cannot be used as a basis for the Tribunal’s
assessment. Indeed, RPS’s objective was to forecast the production that a willing
buyer would have estimated on the date of the expropriation using information
available then and assuming that Burlington’s oil production share was affected by
Law 42. Even if RPS has carried out this exercise correctly (a question that the
Tribunal does not need to address), its calculation is invalidated by these incorrect
assumptions.

The Tribunal further notes that RPS’s reserve estimates, as well as its assertion that
more drilling would not have yielded more reserves, but would merely have
accelerated the depletion of existing reserves, have been proven wrong by

Rejoinder, { 744, referring to: Crick WS1, 4 94.

166

A412.

Petroamazonas’ and Ryder Scott's most recent reports.®"° In particular, by July
2014, Petroamazonas had already produced more oil from Block 21 than RPS
forecast as recoverable. Specifically, RPS forecast a total production of 11.24 million
barrels by the end of the Block 21 PSC,*"' and an expected ultimate recovery of 39
million barrels,®? while by July 2014 Block 21 had already yielded more than 41
million barrels and was still producing new reserves.*"3 As for Block 7, RPS forecast
production of 3.8 million barrels®"* through 2010 and an expected ultimate recovery
of 99 million barrels.*'5 However, from December 2007 to July 2014, Block 7 had
produced an additional 50.17 million barrels of oil,°"° and by the end of 2013
Petroamazonas had updated its reserve figures to (at least) 761 million barrels.®"”
The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Crick that “reality provides the surest check”,®"® and
reality shows that RPS’s projections were wrong. RPS conceded this at the
Hearing.®'°

This does not mean that the Tribunal must adopt Mr. Crick’s projections in their
entirety. It is well-established that a claim for loss of profits requires the claimant to
prove with reasonable certainty that it would have earned the profits sought but for
the wrongful act.® This means that Burlington must prove with reasonable certainty
what volumes the Consortium would have produced “but for” the expropriation.

416.

It must be stressed that the assumption underlying Mr. Crick’s forecast is partially
different from the one articulated in the preceding paragraph. Mr. Crick’s goal was to
establish how much oil the Consortium would have produced had Ecuador complied
with its tax absorption obligations prior to the expropriation and had there been no
expropriation. As a result, he calculates production from December 2007, the date
on which the Consortium stopped drilling, allegedly as a result of the enactment of
Law 42 at 99% and Ecuador's failure to comply with its tax absorption obligations.
By contrast, the Tribunal must quantify the production foregone solely as a result of
the expropriation. While the Tribunal has determined that this production must be
quantified assuming that Ecuador would have complied with its tax absorption
obligations going forward, it cannot take account of cash flows that would have
accrued before the expropriation. As a result, the Tribunal will disregard any cash
flows that would have accrued before the expropriation.

The Tribunal will first address Mr. Crick’s forecast for Block 7 (i) and then his
forecast for Block 21 (ii). It will end by addressing Ecuador’s objections to the use of
the Updated Model to forecast production (iii).

(i) Block 7

With respect to existing wells, Mr. Crick concludes that the Consortium would have
produced 4.3 million barrels of oil from 1 August 2009 to 16 August 2010.%' To
arrive at this figure, Mr. Crick has assumed that the Consortium would have
produced as much oil as Petroamazonas from the same number of wells in that
period.*” The Tribunal accepts this forecast: there is no reason to believe that the
Consortium would have produced less oil than Petroamazonas from the same wells
during the same time period. The Tribunal is mindful of Ecuador’s argument that
Petroamazonas is not an appropriate proxy for the Consortium. While it may see the
merits of the argument in respect of additional drilling (as discussed below), it rejects
it with respect to production from existing wells.

With respect to incremental wells, Mr. Crick assumes that, if the Block 7 PSC had
expired in August 2010, the Consortium would have continued drilling in the Oso
field at a rate of one well per month, but would have stopped drilling one year before
the end of the PSC (i.e. in August 2009), when new investments would have

become uneconomical.®* This would have resulted in 21 new wells drilled within 21
months (from December 2007 inclusive to August 2009 inclusive).

In this connection, the first question that arises is whether it is reasonable to assume
that the Consortium would have drilled new wells in Block 7 but for the expropriation.
For this purpose, the Tribunal will assume that any new drilling would have restarted
after the expropriation, i.e., in September 2009, and not in January 2008, as Mr.
Crick assumes. As noted in paragraph 413 above, the Tribunal cannot take into
consideration cash flows that would have accrued before the expropriation. The
Tribunal has also asked itself whether it may assume that drilling would have
restarted in January 2008 for its quantification of cash flows accruing after the
expropriation (in other words, whether to quantify cash flows accruing after the
expropriation it may assume a production profile resulting from new drilling
commencing in January 2008). It has concluded that it cannot: while the Tribunal
can use the assumptions it considers appropriate to quantify the situation that
Burlington would have found itself in, had the expropriation not occurred, it cannot
change what happened before the expropriation. As a result, the Tribunal will
assume that any new drilling in Block 7 would have resumed in September 2009.

However, as noted above, Mr. Crick admits that any new drilling in Block 7 would
have stopped one year before the termination of the Block 7 PSC, i.e. in August
2009. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot reasonably assume any drilling in Block 7
beyond that date. The Tribunal thus does not accept Mr. Crick’s incremental drilling
projections for Block 7.

The Tribunal has inserted its conclusions with respect to production for existing
wells in the Updated Model, and the results are included in the computation
provided in Section 5.3.4 below.

(ii) Block 21

With respect to existing wells, Mr. Crick forecasts that, between 30 August 2009 and
June 2021, when the Block 21 PSC would have expired, the 33 existing wells in the
Yuralpa field would have produced 25.7 million barrels of oil. Mr. Crick has reached
this figure by applying an initial well production decline rate of 43% that stabilized at

Id., § 140.

9%.**4 The Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. Crick’s quantification of production, which
originally relied on type-curve analysis, is reliable. The Tribunal accepts Mr. Crick’s
explanations on the reliability of type curve analysis and notes that Dr. Strickland
also approved the use of type curve analysis.®* The Tribunal notes in particular that
Mr. Crick’s type curve analysis for the Yuralpa wells shows a 9% decline rate after
36 to 40 months, whether one looks at the performance of the wells between 2003
and 2004 or between 2006 and 2007.®6 In any event, Mr. Crick tested his results
through three alternative methods (individual decline curve analysis of existing wells,
the 2007 Yuralpa full-field simulation model, and the same updated with data to July
2009 and modified to match performance to that date).®?” Notably, Dr. Strickland
separately calculated the estimated ultimate recovery (“EUR”) of Block 21 with four
different techniques (rate v. time, type curve, rate v. cumulative, and water to oil
ratio v. cumulative) in three subsets of wells and on the entire field (a total of
8 different calculations), and obtained results strikingly similar to Mr. Crick’s.®8 The
Tribunal finds this sufficient to substantiate the use of Mr. Crick’s methodology.

The situation for incremental wells is more complex. Mr. Crick forecasts that
24 additional wells would have been drilled in the Yuralpa Main Hollin reservoir,
21 of them 1P wells in the center of the reservoir, and three 2P wells outside that
area. The 21 1P wells were to be “infill” wells, that is, wells drilled between the

The Tribunal is aware that, during Dr. Strickland’s cross-examination, Ecuador pointed out to
a document produced by Burlington identified with Burlington Quantum number BURL-
QUANT00021837, at Tab 18 of Dr. Strickland’s cross-examination bundle. This document
appeared to show the Consortium’s year-end reserves estimate for 2004 and contained a
note that a 25% exponential decline was “typical of Hollin wells” (for P50 wells), noting also a
30% decline for P90 wells. However, Counsel was not able to identify the document, and Dr.
Strickland was not able to comment. The Tribunal has considered this document but has
given it no weight in its overall assessment based on the record as a whole: the document
was never identified, and Ecuador made no mention of it in its Post-Hearing Brief. The
Tribunal is also puzzled by the fact that the document was not presented to Mr. Crick, who
as a witness was in a better position to identify the document than Dr. Strickland. In any
event, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Crick acknowledged a 43% initial decline rate which
stabilized at 9%, which is not necessarily inconsistent with this document.

Strickland ER, §§ 47, 53 (noting that “Mr. Crick’s application of type-curve analysis is
consistent with industry methods of forecasting future production for fields where individual
wells are not well-behaved”).

follows: the aggregate EUR for all three groups of wells was 51,327 million barrels, and the
EUR for all Perenco operated wells calculated together was 51,800 million barrels. These
results are strikingly similar to Mr. Crick’s forecast (52,053 million barrels). Strickland ER,

existing wells to drain the reservoir. Mr. Crick explains that, because of the water
coning in the Yuralpa reservoir, “the sweep of the Yuralpa Field is not good, and you
are getting a very low recovery. There is, therefore, a large amount of oil to be
recovered, and the 21 new wells in the center and the 3 other wells are intended to
produce as much as possible of that remaining movable oil, producible oil”.®2° More
specifically, Mr. Crick explains that, as of the date of his first Witness Statement, the
wells in the Yuralpa Main Hollin had produced only 14.3% of the developable oil in
the reservoir, which is a low number, and that a significant amount of oil remains to
be drained.®° The purpose of the infill drilling would be to recover the oil from those
unswept areas and would provide additional reserves.**' Mr. Crick assumes a
drilling rate of one well per month (which he states is consistent with Perenco’s
historical drilling rate),®° starting in January 2008 and ending in December 2009.
On the basis of the methodology discussed above, Mr. Crick projects that the
Consortium would have recovered an additional 12.2 million barrels from these
24 wells.®>

Again, the Tribunal must determine whether Mr. Crick’s projected incremental
drilling is sufficiently certain to substantiate Burlington’s claim for lost profits in
respect of such production. For this, the Tribunal will first determine whether the
Consortium would have resumed drilling in Block 21 but for the expropriation and
assuming that Ecuador complied with its tax absorption obligations (1), and, if so,
how many new wells would reasonably have been drilled until the PSC’s
expiration (2). It must then determine when such new drilling would have started (3),
and whether Mr. Crick’s methodology for calculating the volumes to be produced
from those new wells is appropriate (4).

(1) But for the expropriation and assuming that Ecuador complied with its
tax absorption obligations, would the Consortium have continued drilling

in Block 21?
The Tribunal must first assess whether, but for the expropriation and assuming that
Ecuador complied with its tax absorption obligations, it is reasonable to assume that
the Consortium would have continued drilling in Block 21. This is not as evident as

for Block 7. Indeed, the Consortium stopped drilling in Block 21 not because of Law
42, but because of problems with the reservoir, which is why it initiated a study of
the Yuralpa field. Mr. Crick’s testimony is that, but for Ecuador’s failure to absorb the
effects of Law 42, the Consortium would have waited for the end of the study and
recommenced in January 2008.

In the Tribunal’s view, it is reasonable to assume that, but for the expropriation and
assuming that Ecuador had complied with its tax absorption obligations, the
Consortium would have recommenced drilling. While the record confirms (and,
indeed, Burlington does not deny) that the Consortium stopped drilling in 2007
because of problems with the reservoir (in particular water problems)®* and
because “disappointing well results in the latter part of 2006 reduced development
opportunities”,®°> the documents cited by Ecuador show that the Consortium would
have resumed drilling once these problems were identified and measures to
increase production were put in place. In particular:

i. The January 2007 Yuralpa Mapping Update®*® analyzes the problems in the
reservoir and describes possible strategies for drilling new vertical and
horizontal wells, including infill drilling, noting a total of 9 contingent wells for the
second semester of 2007 and early 2008.**” It also states that the purpose of the
2007 reservoir study and simulation (referred to at (v) below) is to “[cJonstruct a
forecast model for the new well drilling with optimisation of spacing and
recommendation on operational parameters such as drawdown, total fluid
rates, etc.”.8°8 Finally, this document also shows the Consortium’s concern with

See, for instance: 2007 Sales Memorandum, p. 44 (Exh. E-214) (“Development drilling in
Yuralpa has been challenged due to the presence of a massive, unstable and highly
fractured Napo formation and a fractured basalt layer above the Hollin reservoir, creating
steering and well control problems. A total of 15 wells were drilled in 2005, 14 in 2006, and
one well year to date 2007, the YCG-3. This field is under a strong water drive with relatively
low mobility (oil reservoir viscosity is 60 cp) and due to earlier than expected water
breakthrough in the latest wells, further drilling has been put on hold pending the completion
of a reservoir and completion practices study”).

Law 42, as it poses a question with respect to “[e]Jconomics of new hydrocarbon
Law and with the risk of increasing State share”.°°°

The May 2007 Latin American Reserves Review®*° states that drilling is
currently halted to conduct a field study, noting that the key issue is water
production and that reservoir management practices are needed to manage
water influx.®*1 This document also states that 4 additional wells are planned for
2007, contingent on the study.®4?

Similarly, while acknowledging the Consortium’s difficulties in developing a
drilling program for Block 21, the 2007 Sales Memorandum®* notes that “a
comprehensive field study commenced in October 2006 is being completed in
an effort to improve the following geological modeling and_ reservoir
management issues”, listing the various problems encountered in Block 21.84 It
then explains that “[o]nce this field study has been completed (estimated by late
summer 2007), the knowledge gained will provide for a more refined reservoir
management and development strategy”.®© The document also notes that
“[t]here are significant reserves in infill and offset locations, and the extent of the
field to the south and southeast has to be determined”, adding that “five offset
locations” and “four infill locations [...] have been identified as potential
targets”.° Notably, the Sales Memorandum also states that “[e]stimates
suggest only a small portion of total oil in place has been produced to date
leaving a significant exploitation opportunity”, adding that “[u]pon the completion
of the current reservoir study, improved reservoir management and well
operations ought to significantly enhance the productivity of the Block”.64”

In the same vein, while the September 2007 Budget Presentation®“® does state
that the “[mJain uncertainty for forecasting of new wells is the structure on the
Western flank”®° and that “[nJo investment is proposed for the first half of
2008”,®° it also indicates that projects could start in the second half of 2008
“depending on the new Ecuadorian Constitution’.®°' It also notes that the
“[rjeservoir model will help define [the] best development strategy” for Block 21,
and indicates that the Consortium is considering drilling between 4 and 8
additional wells on Block 21 in 2008.®?

Finally, the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study (also called Yuralpa Field Study or
Evaluation,® to which the previous documents refer), clearly envisages further
drilling on Block 21. In particular, the study states that “[t]o increase the
remaining reserves additional wells have been considered to be drilled on the
Yuralpa Field in [the] second half of 2008”.°5* More specifically, it also states
that:

“As a result of history match and predictions with existing wells, two
areas have been identified where new wells could be drilled. One is in
the southeast part of the reservoir between wells YCF-3 and CHO-01;
the other one is in the central area between wells YCD-1 and YCF-4.
Sensitivities with drilling between 5 and 7 new wells and maintaining
current liquid rates in existing wells indicate that remaining reserves
can be increased to 32.0 MMstb. Due to added production from new
wells, it is predicted that it will be necessary to upgrade water
handling capacity to 60,000 stb/d by converting CHO-01 to water
disposal well in February 2009. By maintaining current drawdown in
existing wells and drilling new infill wells, it can be expected that
reserves could be increased even further”.®°°

Annex E to Crick WS1. While the document's title appears to be “Yuralpa Field Upper and

page refers to it as “Yuralpa Field Upper and Main Hollin Reservoir Evaluation”. As to the
date, while the final version appears to have been issued in June 2008, the document states
that “[e]dited results were presented at a partner TCM in Quito in September 2007” (p. 1).
This was confirmed by Mr. Crick at the Hearing, who testified that the results of the study
were presented during the Budget Committee Meeting in September 2007 (Tr. Quantum
(Day 2) (ENG), 409:11-21 (Cross, Crick)). The Tribunal will refer to this document as the
“2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study”, which is the name the Parties have used most frequently.

Despite this evidence, Ecuador and RPS argue that the Consortium would not have
carried out new drilling in Block 21 because the Yuralpa field was fully developed on
the date of the expropriation. As has been demonstrated by Petroamazonas’ actual
figures, which has drilled 39 new wells (out of which 3 re-drills), this contention has
been proven wrong.*° Considering that the Block 21 PSC would not expire until
2021, it is reasonable to assume that the Consortium would have continued drilling if
there were undrained reserves in the reservoir. Indeed, the September 2007 Budget
Presentation notes in this respect that the “[Ilonger remaining time gives more
flexibility’®’ (presumably for the Consortium’s development strategy), and this was
confirmed by Mr. Daigre of RPS at the Hearing.®*

The Tribunal thus concludes that, but for the expropriation and assuming that
Ecuador complies with its tax absorption obligations, the Consortium would have
restarted drilling after the completion of the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study.

(2) | How many new wells would reasonably have been drilled in Block 21?

The next question is how many wells it is reasonable to assume that the Consortium
would have drilled until the expiration of the Block 21 PSC. The Tribunal will first
assess whether Mr. Crick’s incremental drilling forecast for Block 21 is reasonable.
To recall, Mr. Crick proposed 24 wells, 21 of which would have been 1P infill wells in
the center of the reservoir, in the 1900 acre area with an oil column greater than 90
feet, plus three 2P wells outside that area. According to Mr. Crick, these wells would
have been drilled between January 2008 and December 2009 at a rate of one per
month. In the Tribunal’s view, for reasons relating to the number of wells forecast
and their type and location, Mr. Crick’s projections are overly aggressive.

First, Ecuador has pointed out the “significant discrepancy” between the number of
new wells proposed by Mr. Crick, and the number of wells that the Consortium had
envisaged drilling prior to the expropriation, a discrepancy which Mr. Crick
acknowledged at the Hearing.®° Indeed, while the 2007 Budget Presentation
considered a preliminary program of 4 to 8 wells, and the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation
Study proposed drilling between 5 and 7 wells, Mr. Crick has proposed that 24 new
wells would have been drilled.

See: paragraph 411 above and paragraph 441 below.

431.

Second, the Tribunal must consider if the location and technical characteristics of
the wells proposed by Mr. Crick are reasonable. 21 of Mr. Crick’s 24 wells were to
be “infill wells” drilled in the center of the reservoir, i.e., wells drilled between existing
wells in an area that had already been drilled.®°° According to Mr. Crick, although
there had been drilling in this area, only approximately 14% of the oil had been
recovered. For Mr. Crick, this low recovery is mostly due to water coning and infill
wells would allow the Consortium to recover oil that had not been swept by the
current wells." In the Tribunal’s understanding, infill drilling as suggested by
Mr. Crick is linked to the existence of water coning.®°2

The existence of water coning in Yuralpa is disputed. While Mr. Crick and
Dr. Strickland affirm that the water encroachment problems in the Yuralpa field are a
result of water coning,®®° RPS denies this and opines instead that these problems
are caused by fracturing.®*

Mr. Crick explains that one of the “result[s] of the Main Hollin’s powerful aquifer is
that the water beneath the reservoir tends to push directly upwards underneath the
producing wells thereby displacing the oil. This is a common process known as
‘water coning’ because the water forms a cone-like shape beneath the oil in each
producing well”.8° According to Mr. Crick, “[t]he existence of water coning in the
Blocks is apparent from a simple application of physics”, as a result of the
characteristics of the field.®° Dr. Strickland shares this view and adds that the

Crick WS1, 9 54-65; Crick WS2, ¥ 146; Strickland ER, 45, 18-40.

RPS ER3, 9 429-450. In particular, RPS notes that two studies commissioned by the
Consortium, one by Beicip-Franlab in 2005 (Geomechanical audit of Yuralpa field, Final
Report, June 2005) and another by Geoscience (2007 Geomechanical Model for the Main
Hollin Reservoir) dismissed water coning as the cause of the water encroachment and
instead posited that the probable cause for the water surges was fracturing.

Crick WS1, 1.54.

Crick WS2, § 114. Mr. Crick explains that “[t]he force keeping the water below the oil — the
gravity force — is weak and cannot be modified. But the force moving the oil and water
towards the wellbore — the viscous force — is much stronger under economic production
scenarios. Therefore, it is easy for the water to move upward towards the wellbore, breaking
through the oil and forming a ‘water cone.’ Moreover, once the cone is formed it can take a
very long time before it settles, given that only the weak gravity force is trying to move the
cone down by moving the viscous oil into the cone. [...]”. Crick WS2, § 115.

176

434.

characteristics of the Yuralpa Main Hollin are such that its production will necessarily
be affected by water coning.**” Dr. Strickland explains:

“If the pressure in the reservoir is greater than the pressure at the

perforations in the well bore, oil and water will move from the high-

pressure region to the lower-pressure perforations. Water coning

occurs when water moves towards a low-pressure area surrounding

the well perforations. If the oil is viscous and not much lighter than

water, as is the case in Yuralpa, water can break through the oil and

swiftly move up into the perforations, resulting in a high percentage of

water produced with the oil (a high “water cut,” which is measured as

a percentage of total fluid production)”.
These explanations suggest that water coning is the direct result of the geology and
characteristics of the field. The Tribunal accepts this explanation, which is shared by
both Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland. The Tribunal has noted RPS's critique of
Mr. Crick’s water coning theory,®° but finds that Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland have

sufficiently substantiated their views.

It is true, as RPS has pointed out, that there is almost no reference to water coning
in the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study or in the other documents which analyzed the
water encroachment in the Yuralpa field.®”° However, while the Yuralpa Simulation
Study does not use the term, Dr. Strickland testified that that Study clearly described
the phenomenon of water coning.®”!

In addition, several of the documents cited in paragraph 424 above show that the
Consortium was considering infill drilling in the Yuralpa field (see in particular the
Yuralpa Mapping Update,®” the 2007 Sales Memorandum®’’ and the 2007 Yuralpa
Simulation Study).°% If, as the Tribunal understands, infill drilling is linked to the

Strickland ER, § 18.
Id, 419.

In particular, RPS maintains that “[w]ell performance data indicates that water coning is not
occurring in the reservoir to a degree which would affect production”, and that in the 9 wells
which experienced drops in the percentage of water (water cut) produced (which could be an
indication of coning), the reason for the drops in water were water shut-off workovers. RPS.

presence of water coning, the fact that the Consortium was considering infill drilling
in Yuralpa suggests that the Consortium believed that water coning was at least part
of the problem. The Tribunal is thus satisfied that, in principle, a drilling plan that
considers infill drilling is reasonable in the Yuralpa field.

That being said, an aggressive infill drilling program in the center of the reservoir
such as the one proposed by Mr. Crick finds little support in the Consortium’s drilling
plans. As noted in paragraph 424.v above, the seven wells proposed in the 2007
Yuralpa Simulation Study were to be drilled in two potential areas: “[o]ne is in the
southeast part of the reservoir between wells YCF-3 and CHO-01; the other one is
in the central area between wells YCD-1 and YCF-4”.8’5 Four of these wells (wells
YCF-AH5, YCF-BH4, YCF-CH2 and YCI-AH2) were to be drilled in the unswept
southeast part of the field two wells (YCF-EH and YCF-GH) in the central area, and
one well (YCF-5ST2) would replace YCF-5H.8° These locations are shown in
Figure 166 to the Yuralpa Simulation Study, which is reproduced below. Six of these
wells were to be drilled in areas of oil depth between 125 and 225 feet (marked in
salmon and red colors), and only one in an area below 100 feet (shown in green).
But only two of these proposed wells (YCF-GH or YCF-EH) could be deemed to
correspond to the characteristics proposed by Mr. Crick (i-e., infill wells in the center

of the reservoir).®””

Mr. Crick refers more to “the 1900 acre area with an oil column greater than 90 feet” (Crick
WS1, 98), which the Tribunal understands to refer to the large red to yellow area shown in
the center of the reservoir. During the Hearing Mr. Crick confirmed that the 21 infill wells
were to be in the center of the reservoir. Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 415:10-11 (Cross,

Once again, the Consortium’s plans do not match Mr. Crick’s proposal, as most of
the wells that the Consortium planned to drill were in the southeastern part of the
field. 882

This does not necessarily mean that the Consortium would not have considered
drilling infill wells in the future. Indeed, as noted above, several of the Consortium
documents referred to the possibility of infill drilling. In particular, the Yuralpa
Simulation Study noted that reserves could be increased, inter alia, by “drilling new
infill wells”,®®° for which more detailed geological work and simulations would need
to be undertaken.® But the record does not support Mr. Crick’s drilling forecast of
21 infill wells.

By contrast, the documents cited above appear to support Mr. Crick’s proposed
three 2P wells outside the central part of the reservoir. While Mr. Crick has testified
that it was the Consortium’s policy not to drill in the fringe areas (i.e., the areas
where the oil column was less than 90 feet deep),®8° the Consortium was clearly
planning to explore the deeper oil column identified in the southeastern area of the
reservoir. While there is some contradiction between the Consortium’s plans and
Mr. Crick’s proposal (Mr. Crick locates these wells in the fringe area and
acknowledges the uncertainty of their production, while the Consortium appears to
have been aiming for a deeper oil column), they both share the goal to test and
drain the unswept areas of the reservoir outside the central oil column.

Despite the discrepancy between the Consortium’s historical plans and Mr. Crick’s
proposal (which he has acknowledged),®®° Mr. Crick has affirmed that his drilling
program is reasonable in light of Petroamazonas’ actual and proposed drilling. It is
true that, since the expropriation, Petroamazonas has drilled 11 new wells in

of the Yuralpa field”).

Crick WS1, § 94. However, Mr. Crick also notes that the Consortium did drill in the fringe in
some instances (“Perenco did not expect to develop the portion of the reservoir toward the
edges where the total oil thickness is less than about 90 feet. This was a deliberate policy to
avoid drilling wells that might produce very little oil. That said, some wells were drilled in this
fringe, and although they are not amongst the best producers, they have cumulatively
produced 3.04 million barrels of oil, and are still producing. Overall these remain very
economic wells”).

Yuralpa (8 if one does not count the re-drills)®®’ and appears to be planning to drill
another 28 wells in that field,®°° which makes a total of 39 new wells (or 36 if we
ignore the 3 re-drills), compared to Mr. Crick’s 24 new wells. However, the Tribunal
agrees with Ecuador that Petroamazonas is not an entirely appropriate proxy for the
Consortium in this regard.

Indeed, the wells that Petroamazonas has drilled or proposes to drill in the future are
mostly of a different type or are in a different location from those proposed by Mr.
Crick. Specifically:

i. Of the 11 new wells drilled by Petroamazonas between 2011 and 2013, 7 were
in the areas recommended in the 2007 Yuralpa Simulation Study, and an
additional 4 were in areas which RPS considers to be infill wells.®° The
locations of these wells is shown in the following figure submitted by RPS:°°

R-PHB, § 323, relying on: RPS ER3, § 280. Mr. Crick has also referred to 11 wells,
specifically, to 8 new wells and 3 re-drills. (Crick WS2, § 188). Although Mr. Crick explained
at the Hearing that the re-drills do not yield new wells, but rather “you subtract one well and
then add it back in a slightly different place, so the total number of wells is not changed by
the redrill” (Tr. Quantum (Day 2) (ENG), 447:9-14 (Cross, Crick)), which would suggest that
Petroamazonas has only drilled 8 new wells, Ecuador and RPS continue to speak of 11 new
wells.

While Mr. Crick had identified these 28 new wells as proposed by Ryder Scott, counsel for
Ecuador have stated that they appear to have been originally proposed by Petroamazonas
and approved by Ryder Scott. See: Tr. Quantum (Day 3) (ENG), 873:15-874:19 (Cross,

As explained by RPS, the locations drilled by Petroamazonas in Areas 1 and 2 are

According to RPS, the four additional wells were drilled as “replacement” wells, and

failure by the Consortium’s standards.®** Dr. Strickland disagrees.®™ Be that as it
may, Petroamazonas’ actual drilling does not support Mr. Crick’s plan of 21 infill
wells.

using production history through 31 March 2013. The average 2P EUR for all 11 wells is

In addition, as RPS has explained, all of the 28 new wells proposed by
Petroamazonas and approved by Ryder Scott in Block 21 would be situated in the
fringe areas. The difference between Petroamazonas’ and Mr. Crick’s drilling
programs is illustrated in the following figure, which shows RPS’s depiction of the
Ryder Scott/Petroamazonas wells in red and Mr. Crick’s proposed wells in black.®%
RPS recognizes that Mr. Crick has not identified the exact location of its proposed
wells,®°” but considers that “Mr. Crick’s description of the locations in the text of his
first witness statement leaves little doubt as to the locations he envisions”.®° As
Mr. Crick described his twenty-one 1P wells as infill wells in the center of the
reservoir (see paragraph 429 above), spaced approximately 40 acres apart, the
Tribunal is satisfied that the figure below shows a reasonable approximation of the
location of Mr. Crick’s proposed wells.

RPS ER4, § 282.
Id., Figure 22.

RPS also criticized Mr. Crick’s failure to identify the exact location of these prospective wells.
It states that “[a]s per industry standards, it is always the case for any reserves reporting
purposes that drilling locations for undeveloped reserves are specifically identified in the
report to allow third parties to confirm the validity and test the ‘reasonable certainty’ of
recovery of those undeveloped reserves. As per the SPE-PRMS Reserves definitions,
Proved reserves in undeveloped locations can only be assigned if the ‘locations are in
undrilled areas of the reservoir that can be judged with reasonable certainty to be
commercially productive.’ Mr. Crick’s failure to specifically identify these locations adds to the
uncertainty of those reserves and Mr. Crick’s ‘water coning’ theory”. /d., § 277.

This figure confirms that almost all of Petroamazonas’ proposed wells are in the
fringe area of the reservoir. In view of Mr. Crick’s testimony that it was the
Consortium’s policy not to drill on the fringe, ®? it would not be reasonable to assume
that the Consortium would have drilled in these areas (with the exception of a few
selected wells to test the deeper oil reserves in the southeastern area, as noted in
paragraph 440 above).

Crick WS1, 4 94.

451.

The Consortium’s past practice and Petroamazonas’ current practice thus do not
support the extent of Mr. Crick’s drilling program. While the Tribunal accepts the
existence of water coning and the appropriateness of drilling infill wells, the record
does not support the drilling of 21 new infill wells in the center of the reservoir.

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Mr. Crick’s program of 21 infill wells in the
center of the reservoir is inconsistent with the Consortium’s past practice and
expectations. It must thus establish on the basis of the elements in the record how
many wells it is sufficiently certain that the Consortium would have drilled during the
remainder of the Block 21 PSC, and at what rate.

As noted above, the record suggests that, by September 2007 (before the
enactment of Decree 662), the Consortium was only planning to drill a maximum of
8 new wells in Yuralpa, only 6 of which were scheduled, starting in the second half
of 2008.°°° In view of all of the factors analyzed above, the Tribunal considers it
reasonable to conclude that the Consortium would have drilled the 6 scheduled
wells, all in 1P locations.

(3) | When would drilling have resumed, and at what rate?

Mr. Crick’s production forecast assumes that, but for Ecuador's failure to absorb the
effects of Law 42 at 99%, drilling would have resumed in Block 21 in January 2008.
The record suggests that this drilling would actually have started in July 2008, not in
January 2008 as Mr. Crick proposes.%' That being said, as explained with respect
to Block 7, the Tribunal will not quantify cash flows on the basis of new drilling that
would have started before the expropriation. It will thus assume that any new drilling
would have started in September 2009, after the expropriation.

The Tribunal has noted Ecuador’s concern that the Updated Model does not contain
a functionality allowing the Tribunal to adjust the start date of new drilling, as Fair
Links suggested. According to Fair Links, this could have been useful because
“changing the starting date of the drilling program would impact projected
production: as the terms of the Participation Contracts are limited and relatively
short (notably on Block 7), any change in the starting date of the drilling program in
fact would alter the marginal return of each investment, potentially leading to a

452.

453.

decision not to drill’.°°? Both experts discarded this possibility because they “cannot
reasonably allocate changes in operating and investment costs that are associated
to changes in the timing of drilling of new wells because implementing such a
manual input in the Joint Model is technically complex and would require to involve
technical and geological experts in order to avoid inconsistent outcomes”.°%°
Ecuador therefore proposes that, should the Tribunal consider implementing this
functionality, it should seek the input of the geological and petroleum reservoir
experts. 9

The Tribunal agrees that such a functionality could have been useful. However,
quantum issues have undergone several rounds and Ecuador could have requested
this function in March 2015, when the Tribunal invited the experts to prepare the first
Joint Valuation Model. At this late stage, Ecuador's request must be balanced
against the need for procedural efficiency.

In addition, it is well established that, once the existence of damage is established,
the Tribunal has wide discretion to determine its quantum. The Tribunal is satisfied
that using the current functionalities contained in the Updated Model allows it to
quantify Burlington’s losses with reasonable certainty, even if it defers the starting
date of new drilling to September 2009. Specifically, the Tribunal has considered
that the deferral of the start of new drilling shifts the cash flows resulting from new
wells forward approximately 1.5 years (from January 2008 to September 2009).
Assuming that Burlington would have drilled 6 new wells in Block 21, and assuming
that all wells produce equally, by the end of the PSC’s life these new wells would
have accounted for 15% of all cash flows.%° If the Tribunal assumes that new wells
were drilled 1.5 years later than has been calculated in the Updated Model, this
deferral can be accounted for by reducing the cash flows in the last 1.5 years of the
PSC’s life (i.e., from January 2020 to June 2021) by 15%. On the basis of the
spreadsheet in the Updated Model where annual cash flows are calculated and,
after applying the appropriate variables, the Tribunal has quantified the impact of
new wells in Block 21 at USD 3,238,801. The Tribunal will therefore subtract this
amount after computing the total cash flows with the Updated Model.

Compass Lexecon and Fair Links Joint Memorandum of 20 September 2016, § 12(c), 4 21.
Ibid.
Ecuador's letter of 4 October 2016, p. 9.

At the time of the expropriation, there were 33 existing wells in Block 21. Adding 6 new wells
gives a total of 39 wells, out of which the new wells account for 15%.

457.

459.

While the Tribunal is aware that this is an approximation,®® it considers that it
reasonably addresses the inability of the Updated Model to account for a deferral in
the drilling start date.

As for the drilling rate, the record supports the rate proposed by Mr. Crick. Indeed,
the tentative schedule set out in the 2007 Budget Presentation shows that the
Consortium was planning to drill new wells at a rate of one well every 20 days.°°” As
a result, the Tribunal accepts Mr. Crick’s drilling rate.

(4) | Production from incremental wells

With respect to incremental wells, Mr. Crick forecasted production using type-curve
analysis. He took empirical data from existing wells to project the initial oil rate, and
then applied the historical production decline rate (43% during the first 24 months of
production and 9% thereafter). For the reasons given at paragraph 420 above, the
Tribunal accepts Mr. Crick’s methodology. The Tribunal notes in particular that Mr.
Crick tested his results against three alternative methods, and Dr. Strickland
independently reached very similar results.

The Tribunal has inserted its conclusions with respect to production for existing and
incremental wells in the experts’ Updated Model, and the results are included in the
computation provided in Section 5.3.4 below.

However, because the Tribunal may only quantify foregone cash flows as of
30 August 2009, it will disregard cash flows computed by Compass Lexecon
between January 2008 and August 2009.

(iii) | Ecuador's objections to the use of the Updated Model to forecast production

Ecuador objects to the use of the Updated Model to calculate production, because it
objects to Mr. Crick’s drilling plans, which it considers unsupported and unsound,
and because “given that RPS did not contemplate any new drilling, the ‘Manual
Input’ option is constructed on the basis of the drilling plans put forth by Mr.
Crick”.°°® According to Ecuador, this means that “in the Updated Model, any new
wells that the Tribunal may be inclined to retain would be drilled according to the

Among other things, the Tribunal is aware that the amount it has calculated has not been
discounted to account for the fact that it would only have been earned in 2020-2021.

schedule, with the frequency and in the order proposed by Mr. Crick, and would
produce the amounts of oil forecasted by Mr. Crick”:9°°

The Tribunal notes that it has dismissed Mr. Crick’s drilling projections, and has
opted instead for drilling projections based on the Consortium’s historical practice
and drilling plans in 2007-2008. Ecuador is correct, however, when it states that, for
any new wells, the Updated Model will assume Mr. Crick’s drilling rate, order and
production forecasts. Ecuador submits that this is problematic for four reasons.

First, Ecuador notes that the Updated Model does not allow the Tribunal to insert the
rate at which new wells would have been drilled, as the Tribunal requested. It adds
that, according to the experts, this instruction could not be reasonably implemented
because it would have had an impact on costs or might entail unknown geological,
operational or technical restrictions. Ecuador emphasizes that “[uJltimately, the
Tribunal has not been briefed by either Party on any rate allowing for the drilling of
more than one well per month. If the Tribunal were minded to consider a drilling rate
of less than one well per month, Ecuador proposes that the Tribunal request the
input of the geological and petroleum reservoir experts to implement such a
functionality in the Updated Model”.°'°

It is true that the experts were not able to implement a functionality allowing the
Tribunal could choose the drilling rate for new wells. The experts explained that
changes in the drilling pace would have implications on the design of the drilling
plans and alter investment costs, and consequently the marginal profitability
associated with investment decisions. Consequently, changes in the drilling pace
would lead to an iterative process which would require geological expertise to
determine whether new wells would be profitable or technically feasible.°'' That
being said, the Tribunal has found that the drilling rate proposed by Mr. Crick (i.e.
one well per month) is in line with the Consortium’s historical practice and is thus
reasonable, and as a result this caveat (and Ecuador’s objection) has become moot.

Second, Ecuador notes that Fair Links considered including a functionality that
would allow the Tribunal to adjust the time when new drilling would have started.
Ecuador therefore proposes that, should the Tribunal consider implementing this
functionality, it should seek the input of the geological and petroleum reservoir

experts.°"? The Tribunal has already addressed this request in paragraphs 450 et
seq. above.

Third, as in Ecuador’s contention the Consortium was not entitled to a contract
extension for Block 7, it considers that the drilling plan associated with Burlington's
extension scenario is baseless. As the Tribunal has dismissed this claim (and, by
the same token, the associated drilling plan), this objection is now moot.

Fourth, Ecuador contends that “the production of such wells, as estimated by Mr.
Crick, is unduly optimistic, as it is based on unsound forecasting methodology”.°"
Ecuador submits that, to remedy this defect, “the functionality proposed by Fair
Links allowing for the adjustment of the productivity of the new wells should, at the
very least, be incorporated into the ‘Manual Input’ option and considered by the
Tribunal”.°'4 The Tribunal rejects this proposal as unnecessary: the Tribunal has
found that Mr. Crick’s production forecasts (both for existing and new wells, where
appropriate) were reasonable and well-supported, "5 so even if this functionality had
been available, the Tribunal would have chosen Mr. Crick’s production forecasts.

On this basis, the Tribunal considers that its reliance on the Updated Model to
calculate production is reasonable and well-supported.

5.2.2 Crude oil prices

The second element to determine revenues is the price at which the crude oil would
have been sold. Each Party relies on the prices provided by its financial experts,
having instructed them on the date of valuation to be used, namely the date of the
award or closest proxy for Burlington and the date of the expropriation for Ecuador.

The experts agree that Block 7 produced Oriente crude oil, while Block 21 produced
mostly Napo crude oil.°® They also agree that, since there are no standard industry
forecasts for Oriente or Napo prices, it is necessary to forecast their price with
reference to a benchmark crude price, adjusted by an average historical price
discount.°'” The main differences among the experts relate to (i) the benchmark

471.

crude oil used as reference, (ii) the methodology to forecast future prices, and (iii)
the use of projected versus actual prices.

For the benchmark crude oil used to project prices, Compass Lexecon favors North
Sea Brent crude (“Brent”), while Fair Links uses West Texas Intermediate crude
(‘WTI’). Compass Lexecon’s rationale for preferring Brent is that, from 2010
onwards, WTI started selling at a large discount to Brent “primarily due to increased
North American production and limited pipeline capacity’.°'® However, Compass
Lexecon does not object to using WTI for forecasts made in 2009 (assuming a date
of valuation in that year), because this was before the divergence between Brent
and WTI.%'° Fair Links does not explain why it prefers WTI over Brent, but
recognizes that Brent is “the other widely accepted crude oil reference”.°° While
Fair Links acknowledges that WTI fell compared to Brent in late 2010, it considers it
irrelevant because it has conducted its valuation as of 30 August 2009.°"

In terms of methodology, Compass Lexecon calculates a forecast for the price of
Brent crude, and then applies a differential to the Brent forecast series based on the
historical relationship between Brent and Oriente/Napo prices.°*? To forecast Brent
prices, Compass Lexecon explains that it has not limited itself to futures contracts
(as Fair Links has done), but has relied “on as many industry sources as possible
(i.e., government agencies such as the EIA, industry analysts, industry consultants
such as AJM and Sproule, and market data from futures contracts)”.°°°

Compass Lexecon explains that Oriente and Napo prices have consistently traded
at a discount to Brent prices, because they are heavier and sourer than Brent and
thus involve higher refining costs. To calculate this historical price differential,
Compass Lexecon has preferred absolute price level differentials (i.e., the absolute
difference in price between Brent and Oriente/Napo measured in US dollars) to price
percentage differences (i.e., the log difference in price measured on a percentage
basis), because the latter have been historically more volatile and because the
former is more reliable being “supported by the idea that the heavy-light differential

473.

is primarily determined by fixed-cost components (namely refining capacity and
technology)”.°24

In turn, Fair Links bases its projections on the price of WTI futures contracts as of
August 2009. It explains that “[flutures contracts can be considered as broadly
accepted price indicators since they provide a reasonable understanding of what the
market consensus on crude oil prices is at a given time”.°*° Indeed, Ecuador argues
that prices of futures contracts “are the only indicator providing a summary of the
expectations of every participant in the marketplace”.°*° Because ‘“[flutures contracts
are usually considered to provide an accurate view of market price expectations for
maximum periods of 5-6 years, given the inherently speculative predictions of prices
over longer time periods”,°”” Fair Links uses the prices of crude oil futures listed six
years forward to project prices between 2009 and 2015. Beyond August 2015, it
applies a constant growth rate corresponding to the expected inflation rate as of
2009. It then adjusts both sets of forecasts by the average historical price difference
between the WTI price and the Oriente/Napo price to account for difference in
quality.926

The most important difference between the experts concerns the use of projected
versus historical prices. Consistent with their instructions on the date of valuation,
Fair Links makes its forecasts with information available on the date of the
expropriation, while Compass Lexecon uses data available on the date of the
nearest proxy to the award (15 September 2014 for its second report, and 31 March
2015 for the Model, and 31 August 2016 for the Updated Model).° Ecuador
criticizes Compass Lexecon because, by using actual price data, it is improperly
relying on hindsight information instead of placing itself in the position of a willing
buyer on 30 August 2009.°°° For Fair Links, “[t]his approach does not reflect the Fair
Market Value of Burlington’s assets at the time of expropriation, i.e. August 2009 but
an ex post understanding of an economic situation that could not have been

anticipated back then”.°°' Fair Links notes that “taking into account subsequent
events would tend to consider lost cash flows as the compensation standard rather
than the Fair Market Value standard, which we understand is the compensation
standard applicable in cases of expropriation under the Ecuador-US Bilateral
Investment Treaty”.9°?

In any event, Fair Links notes that the use of actual oil prices following the recent
drop in international crude prices would result in a much lower valuation than that
advanced in Compass Lexecon’s reports. Indeed, Compass Lexecon’s adjusted
price projections in its second report (based on July 2014 prices) were 6% lower
than in its first report.°°° According to Fair Links, the use of actual prices on the date
of the award would further decrease the valuation of Burlington’s assets: if Compass
Lexecon were to use December 2014 prices instead of July 2014 prices, the
forecast prices over the 2015-2021 period would be US$ 29.56/barrel less than
those used in Compass Lexecon’s second report, thereby reducing the value
quantified by Compass Lexecon by approximately US$ 80 million.°4

At the outset of its analysis, the Tribunal stresses that the experts’ forecasts are
influenced by their instructions on the date of valuation, which depend in turn on the
compensation standard that each Party chose to use.

As explained in Section VII.B.3 above, the standard of compensation in this case is
the international law principle of full reparation. The Tribunal must thus award
Burlington the value of its investment on the date of the award or a proxy for that
date), not to award what a willing buyer would have paid for such investment on the
date of the expropriation. As a result, it is appropriate to award Burlington the cash
flows that it forewent as a result of the expropriation, adjusted to present value
(through an actualization rate for past cash flows and a discount rate for future cash
flows).

To value the asset on the date of the award, the Tribunal may use information
available after the date of the expropriation. As explained in Section VII.B.3 above,
the use of ex post information allows for a valuation that is closer to reality and less

speculative than one that relies on projections based on information available on the
date of the expropriation.

Fair Links points out that the use of actual information would mean that “the damage
assessment will never be fixed until the Block 21 Contract comes to an end in 2021
as oil prices would need to be constantly updated so as to reflect the actual
evolution of the lost cash flows”.%°° This criticism misunderstands the model adopted
by the Tribunal: past cash flows, i.e., cash flows that would have accrued from the
expropriation to the date of the award, are calculated on the basis of actual
information, while future cash flows, i.e., cash flows that would have accrued from
the date of the award to the contract’s termination date) are projected on the basis
of the latest information available on the date of the valuation. While this
computation may not reflect perfectly the actual value of the cash flows had the
contracts been performed until their term, it allows for a valuation that reflects reality
as much as possible on the basis of information available when the award is made.

For this purpose, the Tribunal requested the experts in July 2016 to update the
values used in their Model. The latest projections prepared by Compass Lexecon for
the Updated Model reflects the drop in oil prices since 2014.

For the same reason, the Tribunal accepts that Brent crude is a better benchmark
for the price of Oriente and Napo crude in the circumstances. As explained by
Compass Lexecon and recognized by Fair Links, the price of WTI experienced a
drop as of 2010 due to factors specific to the North American market and is
therefore inappropriate as a benchmark after that date. Nor does Fair Links dispute
that Brent is a widely used benchmark.

Finally, the Tribunal considers that Compass Lexecon’s forecast is more reliable
because it is based on a variety of industry sources, not only on futures contracts.
The Tribunal is not persuaded by Ecuador’s contention that futures contracts are
“the only indicator providing a summary of the expectations of every participant in
the marketplace”.°° As Compass Lexecon explains, by relying on a single source,
Fair Links “ignores all other available forecasts (such as those from government
agencies such as the EIA and industry consultants such as AJM and Sproule)”.°°” In
addition, because the Tribunal is carrying out an ex post valuation, it is more

appropriate to rely on both actual and forecast pricing of goods, including futures
contracts, rather than solely on futures.

5.2.3 Operating expenditures (OPEX)

Burlington relies on its actual operating expenditures (“OPEX”), while Ecuador relies
on OPEX proposed by Fair Links and RPS.

Compass Lexecon explains that OPEX include (a) direct and indirect costs of
producing oil and (b) selling, general and administrative costs associated with
managing the Blocks. Compass Lexecon forecasts OPEX on the basis of historical
costs: it “project[s] all variable Opex on a per barrel basis, based on the cost per
barrel amount for 2008 [...], the latest full-year available before expropriation”, and
“forecast[s] the administrative costs associated with each Block on a fixed basis,
based on the average administrative costs for 2006 through 2008”.°% It then adjusts
variable and fixed OPEX for US PPI inflation.°9

In addition, as a result of Mr. Crick’s expected production profile and associated
costs of development for Block 21, Compass Lexecon “escalate[s] direct extraction
costs and the cost of fluid, lubricants, and chemicals (a component of indirect
extraction costs) by the evolution of the ratio of water to crude oil production”.°°

Fair Links also distinguishes between fixed and variable OPEX, but uses RPS’s
forecast for these costs, which is also based on historical figures. It then adjusts
these costs for inflation using 2009 inflation rates estimated by the International
Monetary Fund.

Although both approaches are similar, they show some differences and Fair Links
criticizes Compass Lexecon’s valuation on three points:%?

i. Compass Lexecon overestimated its variable costs by counting twice the so-
called “Fondo ecodesarrollo regién amazéonica’.

Compass Lexecon ER1, § 49.
Ibid.

Ibid.

Fair Links ER2, 9 109-110.
Fair Links ER2, § 109.

195

487.

489.

ii. Compass Lexecon assesses variable costs on the basis of the Consortium’s
shares and inconsistently prorates fixed costs to Burlington’s shares, i.e. 42.5%
for Block 7 and 46.25% for Block 21, thus underestimating fixed costs.

iii. Compass Lexecon excludes the transportation costs deriving from the ship-or-
pay commitments related to the OCP (Oledoducto de Crudos Pesados) pipeline
from the Block 21 operating costs arguing that these are sunk costs as
Burlington was contractually obliged to pay them until September 2018.
According to Fair Links, “[e]conomic and practical reality dictates that any willing
buyer would have had to take on these costs in order to secure its
transportation rights”, and accordingly considers that they should be taken into
account in the valuation.°° Ecuador also argues that these costs should be
included in the FMV computation, since Burlington did not provide any evidence
that it committed to pay these costs until 2018, or that it indeed continued to pay
such costs after leaving Ecuador.°4*

Compass Lexecon accepted Fair Links’ critique on the first two points and adjusted
its model accordingly.° However, it rejected the third criticism in connection with
the ship-or-pay charges associated with the OCP Pipeline. For Compass Lexecon, it
is correct to exclude these costs from the DCF Model as Burlington had to incur
them whether there was an expropriation or not.®® Fair Links disagrees and
considers that not including the ship-or-pay costs is equivalent to saying that
Burlington “can export its crude from the Amazon to the Pacific for free”.°”

The Tribunal agrees with Fair Links, which is why it instructed the experts to include
OCP ship-or-pay costs in all scenarios considered in the Model.°“°

The Tribunal also notes that the level of OPEX is necessarily linked to a given
production profile. In their overview of the Model, the Parties’ experts observed this
dependence in the following terms:

492.

“21. In paragraphs 8b, 8d, and 8e of PO 29, the Tribunal requested
options concerning the production profile, operating expenses
(OPEX), and capital expenses (CAPEX). We note that these
three variables (production, OPEX and CAPEX) can only be
applied jointly, based on whichever production scenario is
chosen (RPS or Mr. Crick) since each production profile has
corresponding costs and capital expenditures associated with
their drilling plans and water production assumptions. The
corresponding costs (OPEX and CAPEX) are therefore linked
in the Joint Model to the chosen production profiles so as to
avoid any inconsistent and incoherent economic results.

22. The Joint Model therefore allows for the selection of Option 1)
RPS production and its related costs; and Option 2) Mr. Crick
production and its related costs; which can be selected in the
Model Inputs section of the control panel labeled ‘Production &
Costs”.%9
As the Tribunal has chosen a modified version of Mr. Crick’s production profile, the
Tribunal will apply Compass Lexecon’s OPEX calculations, which it understands are

automatically updated in the Updated Model to adjust to the production chosen.

5.2.4 Capital expenditures (CAPEX) and depreciation

Compass Lexecon distinguishes two categories of CAPEX: (a) those related to the
maintenance of existing wells and infrastructure and (b) those related to the
development of additional wells, as forecasted by Mr. Crick.°°

With respect to (a), Compass Lexecon relies on historical CAPEX per gross barrel of
production from 2007, adjusted for inflation."

With respect to (b), Compass Lexecon projects historical drilling costs at
USD 5.29 million per well, times the number of incremental wells estimated by
Mr. Crick (24 for Block 21, 21 for Block 7), for a total gross incremental CAPEX of
USD 250.2 million over 26 months from November 2007 to December 2009.9?
Compass Lexecon also includes ancillary CAPEX related to additional process
capacity, power upgrades and water handling and treatment facilities estimated by

Mr. Crick for a total of USD 92.7 million (USD 45.2 million for Block 7 and
USD 47.5 million for Block 21).

Compass Lexecon depreciates investments on a production per unit basis (“capital
costs are depreciated in a given period based on the amount of production in that
period as a percentage of remaining production”).°4

Fair Links agrees with the categories of CAPEX used by Compass Lexecon, as well
as with the depreciation methodology, but assumes no further drilling (as does
RPS). Consequently, Fair Links recognizes the need for CAPEX to maintain existing
wells, but does not include any CAPEX for additional wells.°°

The Tribunal notes the experts’ agreement on the categories of CAPEX to be
considered, as well as on the general methodology. It also notes that, as explained
in paragraph 489 above, the experts agree that the CAPEX are dependent on the
production profile adopted.°” As the Tribunal has chosen a modified version of
Mr. Crick’s production profile, it will apply Compass Lexecon’s CAPEX projections,
which are automatically adjusted in the Updated Model to correspond to the
production profile chosen.

5.2.5 Taxation

Both Parties’ experts apply a 25% income tax and a 15% labor tax to the
Consortium’s taxable income (i.e. revenues net of both OPEX and depreciation),
which results in an effective tax rate of 36.25%.%* Both experts’ valuations are thus
presented net of taxes.

However, because Fair Links considers the impact of Law 42 before arriving at the
taxable income, it also applies Law 42 taxes to the Consortium’s revenues, following
a “two-step evaluation”: (i) it “first assesse[s] the extraordinary income derived from

Fair Links ER3, § 114.

Joint Valuation Model Overview of 24 April 2015, 9§ 21-22. Fair Links had noted that if
Compass Lexecon’s CAPEX assumptions were applied in a scenario that reflected the
impact of Law 42, the negative effect of the CAPEX would not be compensated by a higher
production (Fair Links ER3, § 103). See also: Rejoinder, 686.

Compass Lexecon ER1, 53, referring to: Block 7 PSC, Clause 11 (Exh. C-1) and Block 21
PSC, Clause 11 (Exh. C-2). The rate is calculated as follows: 1-(1-25%)*(1-15%) = 36.25%.

the difference between Oriente and Napo monthly prices adjusted for quality and the
Reference Price adjusted for inflation’, and (ii) “then applie[s] the 99% State
participation on the extraordinary income’”.%°

The Tribunal has already determined that the economic effects of Law 42 must be
ignored. Because reparation is due assuming that Ecuador would have complied
with the PSC’s and specifically with the tax absorption obligation, the 99% tax on
extraordinary profits mandated by Law 42 must be disregarded. Had Ecuador
complied with this obligation, the Consortium would have been compensated
through the application of a correction factor that would have wiped out the effect of
the Law 42 tax. As a result, the only taxes to be applied in the model are income
and labor tax at a combined rate of 36.25%.

5.2.6 Sequence of variables in the DCF analysis

In addition to objecting to the assumptions used by Compass Lexecon in its DCF
valuation, Ecuador argues that Compass Lexecon calculates the FMV by
misrepresenting the impact of various variables. Referring to Figure 1 of Compass
Lexecon’s Second Report,°® Ecuador alleges that Compass Lexecon “considers the
value drivers underlying a DCF valuation in a sequence that is not in keeping with
how a DCF is built’.°°' For Ecuador, Compass Lexecon considers taxation — Law 42
— before considering oil production and oil prices and thus does not show its full
impact. Nor does Compass Lexecon show the full impact of applying an
exaggerated 12.5% interest on cash flows until the date of the award; both Law 42
and interest should be considered “at the end of the sequence once revenue
(production and price) are determined”.°* Indeed, when these value drivers are
analyzed in the correct order, so says Ecuador, “it becomes clear that the key
differences in the Parties’ damages calculations are (i) the application of Law 42 (a
USD 409 million impact) and (ii) Burlington’s use of an exaggerated 12.5%
actualization rate to calculate pre-judgment interest (a USD 366 million impact)”.°%

By contrast, the other parameters (such as price, production, CAPEX, OPEX and
discount rate) have a lesser impact.%*

501. Reviewing Fair Links’ comments,°® as well as Figure 1 of Compass Lexecon'’s
Second Report, it appears that Ecuador's objections are not directed at Compass
Lexecon’s DCF valuation, but at the reconciliation analysis that the latter offers to
compare its valuation to Fair Links’. Figure 1, which is shown below, does not
reproduce the sequence in which Compass Lexecon performs its DCF valuation; it
shows the sequence in which Compass Lexecon has attempted to reconcile its
damages calculation with Fair Links’:%°

502. From Fair Links’ Third Report, it is evident that its objections relate to the sequence
of the reconciliation, not of the DCF valuation. As Fair Links explains:

“In its second report, Compass Lexecon presents its reconciliation
between our assessment of Burlington’s assets value of $26.3 million
(base case as of 30 August 2009) and its own assessment of $811.1
million (as of 15 September 2014). Starting from the $26.3 million
value presented by Fair Links, Compass Lexecon adjusts this amount
by successively incorporating in a specific order, which we consider
inappropriate and even misleading, each parameter allegedly driving
the difference between the experts. [...]

Ll

[...] Several major issues arise from the logic of Compass Lexecon’s
analysis. In particular, the order of the parameters in the sequence
proposed by Compass Lexecon misrepresents the impact of the
differences between both experts”.°°”

503. In particular, Fair Links opines that “[b]y placing the various operational parameters
(prices, production, operating costs) at the end of the sequence, Compass Lexecon
misrepresents the financial impact of Law 42 and Related Measures”.% This is
because Compass Lexecon’s revenue and cost assumptions already reflect whether
Law 42 is being considered or not (for instance, Compass Lexecon’s revenue
assumptions include all extraordinary revenues, production figures consider the
drilling of new wells, and CAPEX include the cost of new drilling).% As a
consequence, Fair Links proposes the following adjusted reconciliation:°”°

By contrast, there appears to be no material controversy on the sequence of the
DCF computation. The Tribunal understands that both experts compute free cash
flows according to the following sequence: first, they establish revenues (determined
by production volumes and prices) and subtract costs (OPEX, CAPEX (where
relevant), and depreciation) to obtain taxable income, to which they then apply a
36.25% combined income and labor tax. The only difference regarding the
sequence is that Fair Links applies Law 42 taxes to revenues, while Compass
Lexecon does not.

On this basis, the Tribunal is of the view that there is no dispute on the sequence of
the DCF valuation, but merely disputed variables, in particular, the applicability of
Law 42 taxes, that Fair Links, but not Compass Lexecon, applies to revenues, and
the impact of this choice on other assumptions (such as new drilling and CAPEX).
Be this as it may, any possible disagreement between the experts regarding the
sequence in which the different variables are to be computed in their DCF valuation
has been put to rest by the Model, which reflects the valuation model (including the
sequence) agreed by both experts, subject to various assumptions.

5.3 Computation of past and future cash flows

As explained in Section VII.D.3.3 above, as the valuation is performed on 31 August
2016 as a proxy for the date of the award, the Tribunal must consider past cash
flows (that would have accrued to Burlington from the date of the expropriation until
the date of valuation as well as future cash flows (that would have accrued from the
date of the valuation until the term of the PSC). Both sets of cash flows must be
brought to present value: past cash flows must be brought forward through the
application of an interest or actualization rate and future cash flows must be brought
to present value through the application of a discount rate.

The Tribunal will address the discount rate applicable to future cash flows (4.3.2),
and then the actualization rate applicable to past cash flows (4.3.3). Before turning
to these points, it will address the situation of the pre-expropriation cash flows
(4.3.1).

5.3.1 Pre-expropriation cash flows

As noted in paragraph 288.iv above, Compass Lexecon calculates production from
December 2007, the date on which the Consortium stopped drilling, allegedly as a
result of the enactment of Law 42 at 99% and Ecuador's failure to comply with its tax
absorption obligations.

For the reasons set out in paragraph 413 above, the Tribunal will not take into
account cash flows that would have accrued before the expropriation. As a result, it
will disregard any cash flows computed by Compass Lexecon before 30 August
2009.97!

5.3.2 Discount rate applicable to future cash flows

The Parties are generally in agreement with respect to the discount rate to apply to
future cash flows: Compass Lexecon proposes a discount rate of 12.5%,9”* while
Fair Links endorses a 12% discount rate.°”° According to Fair Links, the impact of

The Tribunal notes that the Updated Model contains a functionality that allows the Tribunal to
disregard these cash flows.

Compass Lexecon ER2 q 70. In its First Report, Compass Lexecon proposed a discount rate
of 12.1% for a valuation date of 30 April 2013. Compass Lexecon ER1, 9 54.

Fair Links ER2, § 130.

511.

512.

this difference on the value of Burlington’s assets is USD 0.6 million,°% while
Compass Lexecon calculates it as less than 1%.975

However, the experts disagree on the methodology to arrive at the discount rate;
Compass Lexecon has calculated the Consortium’s Weighted Average Cost of
Capital (WACC) in accordance with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), a well-
accepted method for the valuation of discount rates.°’° Fair Links, by contrast,
opines that “the company’s WACC should not be used in valuing an individual
project due to its specific associated risk”.°’” According to Fair Links, “[t]his is key in
the oil and gas industry where the higher expected return of successful projects
offsets the sunk costs of unsuccessful exploration projects. This implies that the
required discount rate (used to value a specific oil and gas asset) is not the business
WACC, unless the risks associated to the specific asset are similar to those of the
entire business”.°”° In particular, in order to accurately reflect the capital structure of
an oil and gas asset, Fair Links explains that it is “essential to check the
appropriateness of the standard industry WACC before using it to discount the
future cash flows” of that asset.9’° In order to determine “a discount rate that fairly
reflects the return on Burlington’s assets that could have been reasonably expected
by an investor from Burlington’s assets but-for expropriation”, Fair Links considers
the following data: (i) the 12% discount rate used to assess Burlington’s assets at
the time when Perenco intended to purchase them in 2006; (ii) the 13.42% average
rate of return of 56 oil and gas projects in 15 different countries derived from an IHS
CERA study conducted in 2012, and (iii) the 9%-15% range of discount rates
generally used in the upstream oil and gas industry.°°°

The Tribunal takes note of Fair Links’ objections to the use of the WACC as discount
rate, but notes once more that the experts essentially agree with the use of a
discount rate of 12% to 12.5% and that neither of them objects to using the discount
rate proposed by the other. The Tribunal notes in particular that Fair Links accepts

that this range is “about quite the right level”.°' The Tribunal will therefore use
Compass Lexecon’s proposed 12.5%, which corresponds to the WACC, a widely-
used parameter for discounting cash flows. It observes that Compass Lexecon’s
proposed rate is higher than Fair Links’, thereby reducing future cash flows.

Following this rationale, the Tribunal instructed the experts to use a 12.5% discount
rate in their Model,°®* which the experts did.%°*

5.3.3 Actualization rate applicable to past cash flows

By contrast, the Parties fundamentally diverge on the actualization or interest rate to
be applied to past cash flows (what Burlington also refers to as “pre-award
interest’).°* The Parties agree that the same principles apply to interest accruing on
the amount awarded from the date of the award until payment (post-award
interest).°®° Therefore, the arguments and findings set out below apply as well to
that element of Burlington’s claim.

a. __ Burlington’s position

Burlington contends that compensation for delayed payment (i.e., interest) is an
integral component of full reparation under customary international law. According to
Burlington, a State’s duty to make full reparation arises immediately after the
unlawful act has caused harm. If that payment is delayed, the claimant loses the
opportunity to use the funds for productive ends, and thus payment must be subject
to interest. For Burlington, the interest rate must be equivalent to the opportunity
cost to it of having been deprived of the funds in question, and in Burlington’s
submission this opportunity cost is equivalent to its WACC.°®° Burlington asserts that
it “was deprived of the periodic dividends (profits) generated by the Blocks, and was
instead, de facto, forced to reinvest those funds into the fields (i.e., its dividends

Tr. Quantum (Day 4) (ENG), 1275:12-13 (Direct, de Feuardent).
PO29, ¥ 8(h).
Joint Valuation Model, § 30(b).

See, for instance: Mem. § 136 (“In the circumstances of this case, Burlington is entitled to
two forms of interest: pre-award interest, covering losses accruing up to the date of the
Tribunal's final Award; and post-award interest on the full amount of damages awarded by
the Tribunal until the date of payment. Pre-award interest is applied to losses that have been
quantified prior to the Award date (i.e., prior to the date of valuation), in order to reflect the
time value of money and to “actualize” the value of those losses. Post-award interest, on the
other hand, is applied to the entire sum of damages awarded by the Tribunal to ensure that
Burlington is not harmed further by delay in the payment of the Award”).

Reply, § 240; Rejoinder, § 605.
Mem., 9§ 134-144; Reply, 9§ 227-241.

517.

could not be “cashed-out” of the Blocks)”.°°” As a result, say Burlington and its
expert, “the interest rate on the foregone dividends must be equivalent to the return
that Burlington reasonably expected to earn from its investment in the Blocks—i.e.,
the projects’ cost of capital (WACC)”.°® Burlington submits that this approach has
been endorsed by both scholars®® and tribunals.°°°

Compass Lexecon explains in this respect that “to grant Burlington full
compensation for its losses, damages accruing prior to the date of valuation need to
be actualized to the date of valuation at a risk-adjusted rate that compensates
[Burlington] for the opportunity cost of capital of doing business in the industry. This
is because in the absence of Ecuador's measures, Burlington would still be in
business as of the date of award”. In Compass Lexecon’s view, the appropriate
actualization rate is the WACC, which is the same rate that is used to discount
future cash flows, in this case 12.5%, because “it reflects the return expected by an
investor when investing in assets with a similar risk profile”.°

Burlington and its expert object to Ecuador's use of LIBOR plus two percent as an
actualization rate on three grounds:

i. First, it asserts that “if the ‘post-expropriation interest’ rate is to serve as a
measure of the cost of debt for a firm or industry, it should be applied on a pre-
tax basis, not on an after-tax basis”, “because the risk embedded in any debt
agreement is reflected in the pre-tax interest rate”.%°°

ii. Second, it states that LIBOR “is no longer a representative measure of short
term borrowing costs since there has been evidence of manipulation of the
Libor”.°%

iii. Finally, Compass Lexecon “disagree[s] with the notion that, to determine the full
compensation as of a date of the award, one must treat Burlington as if it was
relieved from industry risk at the time of Ecuador's expropriation”.°° While
Compass Lexecon acknowledges that this is valid for the actual scenario, it
maintains that it is not so in the but for scenario, because “[aJbsent Ecuador's
measures, it must be assumed that Burlington would have kept operating in
Ecuador”.°°° Compass Lexecon therefore rejects the application of a risk-free
pre-award interest rate endorsed by Ecuador, noting that the paper by Fisher
and Romaine on which Ecuador relies has been criticized for ignoring the
defendant’s cost of borrowing.°°”

Alternatively, Compass Lexecon proposes to apply the “coerced loan theory”, under
which “the State’s failure or delay in paying compensation for expropriated assets is
recognized as effectively a free loan to the State”, which Ecuador must then repay
with interest on the date of the award.°°* This interest should be the one that
Ecuador would pay any other lender, namely “at a rate equivalent to Ecuador's
external cost of debt financing from private lenders”.% On this basis, Compass
Lexecon proposes to apply Ecuador’s long-term cost of debt, whose 1-year average
is 7.9%.'%° According to Compass Lexecon, if Ecuador should pay less than its cost
of debt, “it would be as if Ecuador had obtained a below market rate loan from
Burlington at the time of expropriation”, and “would thereby benefit economically
from what the Tribunal has found to have been an unlawful expropriation”. 10°
Compass Lexecon emphasizes that the coerced loan theory undercompensates

Burlington, but if an alternative actualization rate were used, it would have to be “at
least equal to or greater than Ecuador's cost of lending'° during the corresponding
update period”. 1

For Burlington, an award of interest should accrue on a compound basis.'°*
Burlington notes that many investment tribunals have found that this is the best way
to give effect to the principle of full reparation, and that compound interest reflects
economic reality in modern times.'°°> According to Burlington, Ecuador recognizes
the appropriateness of compounding, as it seeks compound interest on its claims
against Burlington.'°° Burlington thus requests that “{ajll interest awarded to
Burlington should thus be subject to reasonable compounding”, noting that “[t]he
appropriate periodicity of the compounding is annual, since the WACC is calculated
on the basis of annual expected returns”. 107

Contrary to Ecuador's contentions, Burlington argues that Ecuadorian law is
irrelevant to the question of compounding in this case. Burlington stresses that “[t]his
is an international law dispute in which Burlington seeks compensation for the
violation of its rights under international law’, and “[t]he law governing damages [is]
customary international law”. 1°°°

b.  Ecuador’s position

For Ecuador, “even if the Arbitral Tribunal were inclined to award compensation to
Burlington, it should not depart from customary international law and Ecuadorian law
(where applicable) and should, at the very least, apply the standard of compensation

The Tribunal understands that the expert means cost of borrowing.

set out in the Treaty for expropriation. Per international and Ecuadorian law, the
appropriate post-expropriation interest rate should be equivalent to LIBOR plus a
reasonable commercial spread of 2%”. 100°

Ecuador contends that using the WACC as interest rate, as opposed to using it as
discount rate, leads to overcompensation.'°"° According to Ecuador, Burlington
adopts a higher discount rate than Ecuador to discount future cash flows for purely
strategic reasons, since it wishes to apply that same rate to its past lost profits
where the impact is much greater.'°"' Indeed, with an interest rate of 12.5% on past
lost profits, Burlington adds USD 366 million (out of USD 632.6 million) in interest,
representing 58% of the total past lost profits claim.'°'? As a result, Burlington's lost
profits claim is “mostly a claim for pre-judgment interest at the exaggerated rate of
1 2.5%” 1013

Ecuador further argues that the use of the WACC as an actualization rate (or post-
expropriation interest rate, as Fair Links calls it) is particularly inappropriate because
the WACC includes a premium or “reward” for risk, when Burlington no longer bore
any risk having ceased operations.'°'4 As Fair Links stresses, the damage related to
the expropriation would be actualized “with a full industrial risk” between the date of
the expropriation and the date of valuation, when in fact (i) Burlington “was relieved
from the industrial risk related to the assets in August 2009”, and (ii) “[iJn any case
(and Compass Lexecon is surprisingly silent about that), the Participation Contract
of Block 7 (the most important and profitable Block operated by the Consortium in
Ecuador) and the related risk were to come to an end in August 2010”. 1°15

Ecuador further specifies that the WACC could only be used as an actualization rate
for lost profits accruing before 30 August 2009, for a time when Burlington was
exposed to industry risk in Ecuador (assuming, quod non, that Burlington could

claim for any pre-expropriation lost profits). Thereafter, only an interest rate
consistent with the Treaty should be applied. '°'

In this respect, Ecuador submits that Article Ill(1) of the Treaty requires the
application of a commercially reasonable pre- (and post-) award interest rate. 1°17
According to Ecuador, “[t]he ordinary meaning of ‘interest at a commercially
reasonable rate’ is one that is available to companies in the market and
remunerates the time value of money”.'°'8 In Burlington’s case, this requires a rate
that “reasonably reflects the after-tax cost of debt commercially available to U.S. oil
and gas companies for dollar borrowings”.'°'? Relying on Fair Links’ understanding
of industry practice, Ecuador submits that the appropriate interest rate is LIBOR plus
two percent, with an average yield of 2.33%. 107°

Ecuador contends that the use of LIBOR plus an appropriate margin has been cited
as an example of a commercially reasonable rate in other BITs signed by the United
States.'°2! In addition, several investment tribunals have applied LIBOR plus two
percent as an interest rate for purposes of treaties based on the U.S. Model BIT, 1°

as have other tribunals based on other treaties.'°° Commentators have recognized
that LIBOR plus two percent is a commonly-used interest rate. 1°

Ecuador rejects Compass Lexecon’s objections to the use of LIBOR plus two
percent for the following reasons:

i. First, Ecuador contends that “computing post-expropriation interest on a pre-tax
basis is inconsistent with the determination of the other damage components on
an after-tax basis and at odds with the full compensation principle”, because
“[nlo matter how Burlington would have used the funds received as
compensation to generate revenues, it would have had to pay taxes”.'° As
explained by Fair Links, by computing interest on a pre-tax basis, “Compass
Lexecon chooses to ignore one of the basic rules of business valuation
according to which an asset appraised on an after-tax basis is to be consistently
discounted through an after-tax actualisation rate”. 1°76

ii. Second, Fair Links explains that, regardless of the LIBOR “scandal”, LIBOR
remains a valid interest rate.'°°”

iii. Third, “were post-expropriation interest to reflect the industrial risk borne by
Burlington in a ‘but for’ scenario (represented by a 12.5% WACC according to
Compass Lexecon), compensation would be determined on the basis of a
theoretical risk, instead of the actual risk borne by Burlington”. 1°78

As a result, Ecuador argues that Burlington’s 12.5% pre-judgment interest rate must
be discarded,'°? as must its alternative case of a 7.9% borrowing rate.'°° If the
Tribunal were to reject the use of LIBOR plus two percent, Ecuador proposes as an
alternative that the Tribunal should apply one of the other commercially reasonable
rates applicable to the oil and gas industry proposed by Fair Links, i.e. (i)

ConocoPhillips’ after-tax cost of debt calculated over the 2009-2013 financial years

equivalent to the “cost incurred by a claimant party to borrow an amount equivalent
to the potential compensation of which they were deprived on the US financial
markets”. 103"

As regards compound versus simple interest, Ecuador submits that both customary
international law and Ecuadorian law require that any award of interest should
accrue on a simple interest basis.'°°? Ecuador argues that this is the position
reflected in the commentaries to the ILC Articles,'°° as well as the position adopted
by several arbitral tribunals.'°°* Ecuador denies that there is a trend towards the
application of compound interest, and submits that compound interest should only
be awarded when it is appropriate in the circumstances, which is not the case
here. 1035

In addition, Ecuador notes that Ecuadorian law prohibits compound interest,'%°
noting that the tribunal in Duke Energy v. Ecuador held that the prohibition of
compound interest in Ecuadorian law had to be enforced despite the fact that the
resolution of the dispute hinged on international law.'°” Finally, Ecuador clarifies
that, in accordance with Ecuadorian law, it is limiting its claim for interest on the
amounts sought under its counterclaims to simple interest. 1°*

c. Analysis

As it has already anticipated, a majority of the Tribunal agrees with Burlington that
past cash flows must be brought to present value through the application of an
actualization or interest rate. This is a consequence of the principle of full reparation:
in order to make Burlington whole, cash flows that would have accrued between the
date of the expropriation and the date of valuation must be actualized on the date of
the valuation in order to reflect the time value of money.

That being said, the Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the WACC is not necessarily
the appropriate actualization rate for this purpose. The WACC contains an element
of cost of capital that allows cash flows to reflect the time value of money, but it also
includes a reward for all the risks involved in doing business. The WACC is thus
appropriate to discount future cash flows, because these flows are adjusted to
reflect the time value of money (i.e., that 100 dollars in the future are worth less
today) and to reflect the risks of doing business due to the fact that the operator's
profit-making capacity is not certain.

By contrast, using the WACC as an actualization rate for past cash flows could
overcompensate Burlington. While the WACC contains an element of cost of capital
that would allow past cash flows to reflect the time value of money (i.e., that 100
dollars in the past are worth more today), it also contains an element of reward for
risk that is inappropriate here because Burlington no longer bears the risk of
operation. As Fisher and Romaine conclude in the paper quoted below, a claimant is
entitled to interest compensating for the time value of money, but not for risk:

“The violation took place at a single point of time, time 0. It involved
the destruction of an asset whose value at that time is clearly known
as Y. Hence, had damages been assessed at time 0, an award of Y
would have made the plaintiff whole. Unfortunately, however, the
processes of justice take time, and the award is to be made at time t
> 0. How (if at all) should the plaintiff be compensated for this fact?

At first glance, it may seem that the plaintiff is entitled to interest at its
opportunity cost of capital, r. After all, had the plaintiff received Y at
time 0, it would have invested the funds, receiving presumably its
average rate of return. Hence, by time t, the plaintiff would have had
Ye", so this is the amount that would make it whole. Another version
of this argument would compensate the plaintiff at the rate it
reasonably expected to earn on the destroyed asset.

The fallacy here (in either version) has to do with risk. The plaintiff's

opportunity cost of capital includes a return that compensates the
plaintiff for the average risk it bears. But, in depriving the plaintiff of an

213

534.

535.

1039

1040

1041

asset worth Y at time 0, the defendant also relieved it of the risks
associated with investment in that asset. The plaintiff is thus entitled
to interest compensating it for the time value of money, but it is not
also entitled to compensation for the risks it did not bear. Hence

prejudgment interest should be awarded at the risk-free interest rate,
re< ”,1039

This was also the approach taken by Perenco’s expert, Prof. Kalt also of Compass
Lexecon, in connection with Perenco’s claim for past cash flows against Ecuador.
After explaining that future cash flows must be discounted at the WACC, Dr. Kalt
refers to the actualization of past cash flows as follows:

“[P]ast amounts (such as revenue from additional wells that Perenco
would have drilled) that would have accrued to Perenco prior to the
date of valuation but for Ecuador’s unlawful actions must also be
accounted for and brought forward to December 1, 2014 in order to
reflect the time value of money between when those damages were
incurred and the date of valuation. If Perenco is to be kept
economically whole, the amount of the final damages awarded should
reflect the foregone value of not having access to that money for the
period between when the amounts accrue and the evaluation date.

Unlike the discount rate used to discount the stream of future cash
flows discussed above, which must be high enough to compensate
for the level of non-diversifiable project-related risk, the rate used to
compensate Perenco for the time value of these monies is lower. This
reflects the fact that, while Perenco is forgoing the time value of
money on any damages award while waiting for such an award, the
award amount is not being invested by Perenco in any risky
endeavour that would require compensation for risk. Accordingly, the
interest factor to be applied to the historical period up to the date of
actual payment of damages to Perenco is a relatively low and risk-
free rate of interest”. 14°

The Tribunal considers that this is the correct approach here. The Tribunal will thus
apply a reasonable risk-free commercial rate. Ecuador has proposed LIBOR plus
two percent for three month borrowings, and the Tribunal agrees. The Tribunal also
notes that this has been the rate used by many investment tribunals in recent
years. 1041

Having selected the applicable rate, the Tribunal must decide whether interest must
be compounded or not. For that, it must first determine the law governing this issue,
namely whether it is Ecuadorian or international law. At paragraphs 177 to 179 of
the Decision on Liability and as reiterated in paragraph 44 above, the Tribunal has
concluded that it will apply (i) first and foremost the BIT and, if need be, (ii)
Ecuadorian law and those rules of international law “as may be applicable”. It further
clarified that it is for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national
or international law, being understood that a party may not rely on its internal law to
avoid an obligation under international law.

In the Tribunal’s view, it is not appropriate to apply national law to the issue of
compound interest. The application of national law may be appropriate for contract
claims, but not for a claim of a breach of the BIT such as the present claim. The
responsibility of a State arising from an unlawful expropriation is governed by
international law, triggering the State’s obligation to make full reparation for the
injury caused, including compensation for the time value of money. As a result,
whether interest should be simple or compounded is a matter to be addressed under
international law. 1°

The cases cited by the Parties support this conclusion. In three of the cases cited by
Ecuador, Desert Line v. Yemen, Aucoven v. Venezuela and Duke Energy v.
Ecuador, the application of interest related to damages arising from contract claims.
As a result, both in Aucoven and Duke Energy, the tribunals found that it was
appropriate to apply national law to the question of compound interest, and thus
favored the award of simple interest.' In Duke Energy, the tribunal specifically
noted that “compound interest may be awarded for expropriation but not for contract

provided no reason for its decision to award simple interest. See: Desert Line v. Yemen,

claims”.'°4 Other arbitral tribunals have also distinguished between disputes arising
from treaty breaches and those arising from contract breaches. 145

The Tribunal will thus apply international law to determine whether interest must be
simple or compounded. In the Tribunal’s view, this question must be answered by
reference to the standard of compensation. As this standard is the customary
international law principle of full reparation, the interest awarded should aim to fully
repair the time value of money lost by the fact that Burlington was deprived of cash
flows due to it. Compound interest, which has become the standard to remunerate
the use of money in modern finance, comes closer to achieving this purpose than
simple interest. Indeed, being deprived of the use of the money to which it was
entitled, a creditor may have to borrow funds or may forego investments, for which it
would pay or earn compound interest. As noted in Continental Casualty:

“[C]ompound interest reflects economic reality in modern times, and

the hesitation may be directed more at extreme rates [...] rather than

compound interest in principle. The time value of money in free

market economies is measured in compound interest; simple interest

cannot be relied upon to produce full reparation for a claimant’s loss

occasioned by delay in payment; and under many national laws

recently enacted, an arbitration tribunal is now expressly empowered

to award compound interest”. 14°
Ecuador has pointed out that, according to the Commentary to ILC Article 38, “[t]he
general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound
interest”.'°47 Given the recent developments in international investment law, the
Tribunal cannot agree. As noted in Occidental II, while “[t]he traditional norm was to
award simple interest [...] this practice has changed and, in fact, most recent awards
provide for compound interest”. '°* Indeed, a significant number of arbitral tribunals
have adopted the view that compound interest achieves full reparation better than
simple interest.'°° This Tribunal is of the same view, and will thus award compound
interest.

545.

Burlington has submitted that compounding should be carried out on a yearly basis,
which the Tribunal considers reasonable.

For the reasons stated above, past cash flows (i.e., cash flows accrued from the
date of the expropriation to the date of valuation., i.e. 31 August 2016) will be
actualized at a rate of LIBOR plus two percent from the date on which they should
have accrued and until 31 August 2016, compounded on an annual basis. This
actualization rate has been applied by the Tribunal to all past cash flows through the
Updated Model. It is thus already included in the damage amount computed through
the model.

5.3.4 Computation of lost cash flows

Having applied the assumptions set out above to the Updated Model, Burlington's
lost profits are quantified at USD 383,041,068 on a 31 August 2016 date of
valuation. As anticipated in Section VII.D.5.2.1 above, to account for the deferral of
new drilling in Block 21, the Tribunal will subtract the part of the cash flows that can
be attributed to new wells in the last 1.5 years of operation of Block 21, i.e. from
January 2020 to June 2021. The Tribunal has calculated that 15% of these cash
flows could have been attributed to new wells, for a total of USD 3,238,801. As a
result, the Tribunal quantifies Burlington’s lost profits at USD 379,802,267.

6. _Burlington’s claim that the Award be protected against taxation

Burlington notes that it has calculated its damages net of Ecuadorian tax. As a
result, “any taxation by Ecuador of the Award would result in Burlington being
effectively taxed twice for the same income”.'° Citing ConocoPhillips v. PDVSA,
Burlington argues that this would undermine the principle of full reparation. 1°

As a result, Burlington requests the Tribunal to declare that:

i. “The Award is net of all applicable Ecuadorian taxes”;

Award of 5 October 2012, § 840 (Exh. CL-240) (holding that awarding compound interest

ii. “Ecuador may not tax or attempt to tax the Award”; and
iii. “Burlington has no further taxation obligations to Ecuador”. °°?

Ecuador does not engage with this claim, but it appears to accept that Burlington’s
damages are calculated net of taxes (indeed, both Parties’ experts’ calculate net
cash flows after the application of Ecuadorian income tax and labor participation
tax). 1058

It is undisputed that the cash flows have been computed net of income and labor
participation tax. As a result, the Tribunal agrees that the amounts awarded to
Burlington in this Award are net of income and labor participation taxes, and that
Ecuador may not impose or attempt to impose these taxes on the Award. By
contrast, the Tribunal is unable on the record before it to make a general declaration
about “all taxes”, as Burlington has not sufficiently substantiated this request.

E. Must COMPENSATION BE REDUCED TO ACCOUNT FOR BURLINGTON’S ALLEGED
CONTRIBUTION TO ITS OWN Losses?

The Tribunal will now address Ecuador's defense that any recovery by Burlington

must reflect Burlington’s contribution to its own losses, starting with Ecuador's

position.

1. Ecuador’s position

1.1. Asa matter of law, compensation must reflect the injured
party’s contribution to its own losses
Ecuador contends that, as a matter of law, compensation must be excluded (or, at
the very least, significantly reduced) if the alleged victim contributed to its loss. '°*
Relying on Article 39 of the ILC Articles, Ecuador maintains that “any compensation
for an internationally wrongful act must reflect any intentional, reckless or negligent
conduct of the injured party that contributed to the losses in question”.'°°° Ecuador
notes that the principle of contributory negligence is recognized by the majority of

legal systems (including Ecuador)'*® and has been endorsed by arbitral
tribunals'°°” and scholars. °°

According to Ecuador, an investor's conduct may “fatally sever[] the chain of
causation”, '°°° in which case compensation should be excluded. Even where the
causal chain is not broken, the fact that the victim by its behavior contributed to the
harm it suffers must lead to a reduction of the compensation awarded.

Ecuador contends that Burlington’s attempts to narrow the effect of the principle of
contributory negligence must be rejected. Admitting arguendo that Ecuador has
unlawfully expropriated Burlington’s investment, this does not preclude a finding of
contributory negligence.'°° Nor is this principle limited to cases in which the
claimant's behavior was unlawful or prohibited; it also applies when it was merely
imprudent. Finally, all 11 cases cited by Ecuador support the proposition that
contributory negligence must be factored in the calculation of compensation. 1°

1.2 Asa matter of fact, Burlington materially contributed to its
own losses

Ecuador alleges that Burlington’s behavior broke the chain of causation or at least
significantly contributed to the losses.’ It argues that “Burlington took a number of
willful, reckless, or negligent steps that exposed it to a serious risk that Ecuador
would intervene in Blocks 7 and 21, setting aside whether or not such intervention
was appropriate under the circumstances (which it was)”.'° Specifically, Ecuador
asserts that, if Burlington had paid its mandatory Law 42 dues and not suspended
operations'(Section 1.2.1 below), or not impeded the Consortium’s negotiations
with Ecuador’ (Section 1.2.2 below), Ecuador would not have been forced to take
over Blocks 7 and 21. In any event, if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over
Burlington's claim for past Law 42 dues, Burlington’s behavior during the coactiva
proceedings prevents compensation for the market value of the oil seized (Section
1.2.3 below).

1.2.1 Burlington contributed to its own losses by ceasing to
pay Law 42 dues and suspending operations
Ecuador argues that the Tribunal “cannot overlook the cause-effect relationship
between Burlington’s failure to pay its Law 42 dues, the coactiva process, the
abandonment of the Blocks and the declaration of caducidad. Had Burlington paid
its Law 42 dues, the Consortium would have continued to operate the Blocks and
the present Arbitral Tribunal, the jurisdiction of which is limited to alleged Treaty
breaches, would not be considering Burlington's compensation”.'°° When
Burlington ceased paying the Law 42 dues, “it manufactured a crisis which [...] was
entirely unnecessary”. '°” Burlington knew or should have known that ceasing to pay
Law 42 dues would force Ecuador to commence coactiva proceedings against it. It
should also have known that the “inevitable consequence” of deciding to suspend
operations would be State intervention, given the State’s constitutional duty to
ensure the continuity of oil operations and the risk of damage that the suspension

entailed. '°® Ecuador was thus left with no choice but to intervene. Even if the
Tribunal does not reconsider its decision that the intervention constituted an
expropriation, “it should at the very least take into account the recently disclosed
evidence to hold that Burlington's behavior was a contributory cause of its loss”.'°?

Contrary to its contentions, Burlington had no justification to cease paying the Law
42 dues. First, the Tribunal refused to find that Law 42 was expropriatory and that
the expropriation had been carried out in a manner that was unfair, inequitable,
arbitrary or in contravention of Ecuador’s obligations. As a result, Ecuador's
application of Law 42 to Burlington was not an internationally wrongful act. Even if it
had been a contractually wrongful act, Burlington could not rely on it because the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction over contract claims. In any event, Ecuador's contractual
breach did not substantially deprive the contract of value. '°”°

Second, the payment of taxes is a mandatory legal obligation. Like the claimants in
Micula, Burlington exposed itself to the consequences of failing to comply with a
legal obligation.1°”"

Third, Burlington cannot argue that its failure to pay the Law 42 dues was justified by
the Tribunal’s recommendation of provisional measures in PO1, which is dated 1
June 2009, when Burlington stopped its payments one year earlier. In any event, the
Tribunal’s recommendation in PO1 is not binding on Ecuador. Moreover, that order
was rendered on the Tribunal’s prima facie acquaintance with the case, and was
superseded by the Decision on Liability, which held that neither Law 42 nor the
coactiva measures were expropriatory. 1°72

Fourth, the Consortium was negligent in not submitting to Ecuador an economic
analysis demonstrating that Law 42 had affected the economy of the PSCs. While
the Tribunal refused to find that the Consortium’s “pledge” to submit these figures
was a condition precedent, it remains that the Consortium breached this pledge and
acted negligently.”

Ecuador also denies that Burlington's decision to suspend operations in the Blocks
was justified.'°* Ecuador has invited the Tribunal to reconsider its findings on these
facts in its Motion for Reconsideration, but “[e]ven accepting, quod non, that
Ecuador's intervention in Blocks 7 and 21 constituted an expropriation, the manner
in which the Consortium proceeded to first threaten to and then suspend its
operations, and the fact that it did not resume operations after having been invited
by Ecuador to do so clearly contributed to its losses”.'°’> Even if Burlington had the
right to suspend operations (which Ecuador denies), Burlington had the obligation to
exercise that right prudently, which it failed to do. Relying on RPS’s expert opinion,
Ecuador contends that “Burlington’s threatened suspension created four significant
types of risk for Blocks 7 and 21: (i) reservoir damage; (ii) mechanical damage; (iii)
environmental damage; and (iv) economic loss”.'°© The newly disclosed
Suspension Plan shows that Burlington was aware of these risks and of the risk that
Ecuador would intervene. Burlington nonetheless proceeded with the suspension
and failed to resume operations in “reckless disregard” of these risks.'”” This
decision was “fully disproportionate in the circumstances” because it meant “putting
the entire operation underlying the [PSCs] at risk”. It was also taken “in blatant
disregard of the Consortium’s obligation to first seek the Tribunal’s permission to
suspend operations”.'°”® The only explanation for Burlington's decision to abandon
the Blocks was that it was part of Burlington’s “cynical self-expropriation, exit
strategy”.'079

On this basis, Ecuador submits that the Tribunal should deny Burlington recovery
altogether or at the very least substantially reduce any compensation to which it
might be entitled. Ecuador argues that Burlington’s conduct is “far more
reprehensible” than the behavior that other tribunals have considered. As in Micula,
the Tribunal should hold that Burlington’s failure to comply with its tax obligations
excludes Ecuador's liability. Alternatively, it should hold that such failure was a bad

or imprudent business decision as in Enron, MTD, Azurix, RosinvestCo, Anatolie
Stati, and Goetz. ‘°°

1.2.2 Burlington contributed to its own losses by boycotting
negotiations with the State

For Ecuador, consistent with practice and international law, Burlington had a good
faith duty to negotiate with the State when oil prices increased. This duty arises from
the principle of good faith and trade usages, which Burlington itself invokes in
connection with the extension of Block 7. Burlington cannot argue that there is a
global practice to renegotiate contracts to extend their term (quod non) and deny at
the same time that there is a practice to renegotiate contracts in light of changed
circumstances. Similarly, Burlington had a duty not to withdraw from the
negotiations. 1°

In violation of this duty, Burlington boycotted the negotiations and prevented
Perenco from agreeing fairer terms with the State. But for Burlington’s boycott, the
Consortium would have continued operating the Blocks and would have entered into
service contracts for Blocks 7 and 21 with Ecuador, “and this case would be
over”. '°82 Rather than negotiating in good faith, says Ecuador, Burlington remained
focused on its self-expropriation exit strategy. It in particular refused to sign the Draft
Transitory Agreements negotiated by Perenco and threatened Perenco against
entering them. Burlington also wrongfully terminated negotiations after Perenco had
executed the March and October Transitory Agreements. While the former
contained reservations of rights, the latter did not and were duly executed. '°8

In boycotting the negotiations with the State, the Respondent submits, citing MTD,
that Burlington failed to “safeguard its own interest”.'°°* With reference to Enron,

1.2.3 Burlington contributed to its own losses due to its
behavior during the coactiva proceedings

In any event, if the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction over Burlington's claim
for “historical damages”, which the Tribunal understands to refer to the claim for past
Law 42 dues and seizures, Ecuador submits that compensation for such claim
should be reduced to take into account Burlington’s threats to take legal action
against any company that purchased the oil auctioned in the coactiva process. '%
The Tribunal has already found that only Burlington can be blamed for the failure of
other bidders to participate in the auctions and that, as a result, “the compounded
effects of the coactiva measures, over and above the effects of Law 42 at 99%, are
not attributable to Ecuador”.'°8” Consequently, Burlington can only claim the value at
which the oil was actually sold, as opposed to its market value. 1°

Burlington’s argument that Ecuador ignores the principles of a “but for analysis” is
patently wrong: even if the Tribunal had jurisdiction over Burlington’s contract claims
or finds these claims admissible, the compounded effects of the coactiva
proceedings were not caused by the expropriation, as they relate to debts that
accrued before the expropriation took place. 1°

2.  Burlington’s position

Burlington denies that it contributed to its own losses and submits that it was entitled
to insist on its rights throughout the course of the dispute giving rise to this
arbitration.

While Burlington recognizes that compensation may be reduced if a victim
contributed to its own loss, it argues that Ecuador misapplies the principle of
contributory fault. According to the Claimant, “[t]here is no authority for Ecuador's
extraordinary view that compensation should be reduced to punish Burlington for

lawful conduct in defense of its /awful rights against Ecuador's unlawful conduct”. '°°°
None of the 11 cases cited by Ecuador supports this contention. 1°"

On the facts, Burlington denies having engaged in any wrongful conduct that could
justify a reduction of the compensation owed to it. Burlington’s decisions to pay Law
42 amounts into a segregated account (i) and suspend operations (ii) were fully
justified, and Burlington behaved reasonably and in good faith during its negotiations
with Ecuador (iii).

In respect of (i), Burlington rejects the argument that it “manufacture[d] a crisis”. It
was Ecuador who failed to comply with the PSCs, violated the Tribunal’s order, and
ultimately its own law.' In particular, it was Ecuador's refusal to establish an
escrow account for the payment of Law 42 taxes and to discontinue the coactiva
proceedings in violation of the Tribunal’s order that escalated the dispute.

In connection with (ii), while Ecuador recognizes Burlington’s right to suspend
production, it wrongly argues that Burlington failed to exercise that right
prudently. '°° The Tribunal already held that Burlington could suspend operations for
up to 30 days regardless of just cause and that there would have been just cause if
Burlington had suspended for a longer period.'°% In addition, stresses Burlington,
the Tribunal was not “persuaded that the suspension posed such a significant risk of
damage as to justify Ecuador’s immediate intervention”.'° Indeed, Burlington has
established that there was no material risk of harm “in suspending operations in the
manner in which the Consortium intended”. In any event, Ecuador's argument
that “Burlington should be held contributorily negligent because the good faith,
justified exercise of its rights provoked a breach of domestic and international law by
Ecuador” is absurd and unsupported by authority. 19”

With respect to (iii), the Claimant opposes Ecuador’s theory that Burlington
contributed to its losses by boycotting negotiations. Contrary to what Ecuador
contends, it had no obligation to renegotiate due to increasing oil prices. The
Tribunal already held that the PSCs exposed Burlington to “full upside price risk”. 1°
Accordingly, “[i]t was not Burlington’s obligation to renegotiate the PSCs, but rather
Ecuador's obligation to apply a correction factor to the PSCs to absorb the effects of
Law 42”.1°° In any event, Burlington did not boycott negotiations with the
Government. Mr. Martinez confirmed that Burlington had negotiated in good faith
attending all meetings to the extent permitted.''°° Ultimately, it was simply unable to
accept Ecuador's proposals “because they were unreasonable and required
Burlington to relinquish its rights under the PSCs without even knowing what rights it
would obtain in return”."101

Finally, Burlington argues that its claim for historical damages should be awarded in
full. Ecuador ignores the principles underlying a “but for” analysis: had Ecuador
complied with its obligations under the contracts and international law, no coactiva
auctions would have taken place and the Consortium would have sold its oil in the
normal course of business at market price. Burlington must thus be compensated for
that lost production at market price. 1°

3. Analysis

It is undisputed that a claimant’s conduct may justify an exclusion or reduction of
damages if it has contributed to the injury. Article 39 of the ILC Articles expressly
provides:

“Article 39. Contribution to the injury
In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the
contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of
the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom
reparation is sought.”

The Commentary to Article 39 goes on to explain that this provision “deals with the

situation where damage has been caused by an internationally wrongful act of a

State, which is accordingly responsible for the damage in accordance with articles 1
and 28, but where the injured State, or the individual victim of the breach, has
materially contributed to the damage by some wilful or negligent act or omission”. 11°
This provision also “recognizes that the conduct of the injured State, or of any
person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought, should be taken into
account in assessing the form and extent of reparation”.''% This is consistent with
“the principle that full reparation is due for the injury — but nothing more — arising in
consequence of the internationally wrongful act”, as well as with “fairness as
between the responsible State and the victim of the breach”.11°

These provisions must be read in conjunction with ILC Article 31(1), according to
which “[t]he responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the
injury caused by the internationally wrongful act”. The Commentary to Article 31
clarifies that “unless some part of the injury can be shown to be severable in causal
terms from that attributed to the responsible State, the latter is held responsible for
all the consequences, not being too remote, of its wrongful conduct”. 11°

According to Ecuador, Burlington’s conduct prior to the expropriation (specifically, its
decision to stop paying Law 42 taxes, its threat of legal action against buyers in the
coactiva auctions, its decision to suspend the operations, and its alleged
“boycotting” of the negotiations with Ecuador) justifies the exclusion or reduction in
damages.

The question is whether by engaging in the conduct that Ecuador complains of,
Burlington contributed to the injury it suffered. The Tribunal notes in this respect that
“[nJot every action or omission which contributes to the damage suffered is relevant
for this purpose. Rather, article 39 allows to be taken into account only those actions
or omissions which can be considered as wilful or negligent, i.e. which manifest a
lack of due care on the part of the victim of the breach for his or her own property or
rights.” In addition, this willful or negligent act or omission must have “materially
contributed to the damage”. 11°

Ecuador first argues that Burlington's failure to pay Law 42 taxes was the triggering
factor for the chain of events that culminated with the expropriation of the Blocks. A
majority of the Tribunal cannot agree. The triggering factor was the enactment of
Law 42 and Ecuador's failure to abide by its contractual tax absorption obligations.

It was in response to Ecuador's contractual breaches that, from October 2008,
Burlington stopped paying Law 42 taxes and instead deposited the relevant
amounts in a segregated account. It is true that any person subject to the fiscal
power of a state must pay its taxes,'"® unless they are declared unlawful or an
agreement is entered into in this respect. Such an agreement was suggested in
PO1, where the Tribunal recommended that the Parties should “confer and make
their best efforts to agree on the opening of an escrow account at an internationally
recognized financial institution [...]”,'""° failing which they should report back to the
Tribunal for a different ruling.'"'' But the Parties did not agree.

More importantly, Burlington's failure to pay Law 42 taxes cannot be said to have
contributed to its injury. The injury suffered by Burlington and quantified in this
Award is the loss of its investment and more particularly of its future profit-making
potential. This damage was directly and decisively caused by Ecuador’s permanent
physical takeover of the Blocks; Burlington’s conduct did not contribute to the
magnitude of the loss or sever the chain of causation between the wrongful conduct
and the injury.

Even if Burlington’s non-payment were considered to be one of the factors in the
chain of events that eventually culminated in the takeover of the Blocks, it is neither
the triggering factor (which as noted above was the enactment of Law 42 and
Ecuador's failure to abide by its tax absorption obligations), nor the decisive factor.
In this respect, the Tribunal has asked itself the following question: had Burlington
paid its taxes but not agreed to a service contract, can it be concluded with
reasonable certainty that the expropriation would not have occurred? On the basis
of the record and especially of the findings in the Decision on Liability,'"? this

Tribunal confirms that Burlington's failure to pay Law 42 taxes did not contribute to
the injury it suffered through the takeover of the Blocks. Arbitrator Stern disagrees
with this analysis.‘"'

The next question is whether Burlington's threat that it would suspend operations
contributed to its injury. Ecuador argues that Burlington’s threat to suspend the
proceedings violated PO1, where the Tribunal ordered Burlington not to make good
on this threat.''* However, PO1 also ordered Ecuador to stop the coactiva
proceedings, which Ecuador did not do,'"® and to refrain from any action inducing
Burlington to suspend operations.'''® PO1 was revoked by PO2 in October 2009,
but the Tribunal “specified that the Parties remain under a duty not to further
aggravate the dispute”.''!? Ultimately, both Parties violated the Tribunal’s
recommendations, with the result that a reference to PO1 is unhelpful. In any event,
Burlington’s announcement that it would suspend operations came after Ecuador
had significantly aggravated the dispute through the coactiva proceedings.

Nor can it be said that Burlington contributed to the injury by refusing to sign the
Transitory Agreements. Under the test set out in ILC Article 39, the question is
whether Burlington’s conduct can be characterized as a manifest lack of due care
for its own property rights which materially contributed to the damage caused.
Burlington's refusal to sign the Transitory Agreements or otherwise come to an
agreement with Ecuador cannot be characterized as a manifest breach of due care
for is property rights. To the contrary, Burlington was trying to protect its contractual
rights. As Mr. Moyes stated during the Hearing:

“Looking at the Burlington letters . . . | see a company under duress . .
. . And my understanding of the process of negotiation was Law 42
taxes you pay; you enter into a Transitory Agreement with the
Government which is neither complete, it is not final; you continue

Arbitrator Stern disagrees with the analysis of the majority on the contributory negligence of
Burlington, as she is convinced that the behavior of Burlington refusing to pay its taxes
played a major role in the chain of events leading to the expropriation. In other words,
Arbitrator Stern believes that, if Burlington had paid its taxes, as it was obliged to do in order
to respect the State's fiscal sovereignty, nothing would have happened.

PO1, 4 IV.8 (“The Parties shall refrain from any conduct that may lead to an aggravation of
the dispute until the Award or the reconsideration of this order. In particular, Burlington
Oriente shall refrain from making good on its threat to abandon the project and Ecuador shall
refrain from any action that may induce Burlington Oriente to do so”).

Claimant under the coactiva process and shall not initiate new coactive actions”).

paying taxes that you have a dispute about; and you waive your rights

under the Participation Agreement to the tax-absorption clauses and

to any other benefits within that Agreement. That is not a good

negotiating position to put yourself into. That is not what | would

recommend the client do”.'"!®
While the Tribunal agrees that there is a duty to negotiate when there has been a
significant change of circumstances, this duty does not force the parties to reach an
agreement against their consent. Even if Burlington’s “hardball” approach was one
of the factors that induced Ecuador to take over the Blocks, it would be perverse to
find that Burlington’s decision to protect its valid and existing contract rights
contributed to their being taken by force.

Finally, Ecuador argues that Burlington’s threat of legal action against buyers in the
coactiva auctions contributed to its having earned less for the forced sale of oil. As
the Tribunal has dismissed Burlington’s claim for past Law 42 dues taken or seized,
it does not need to address this argument.

For the reasons set out above, a majority of the Tribunal rejects Ecuador's argument
that Burlington contributed to its own losses.

F. Post-AWARD INTEREST

It is undisputed that Burlington has a right to post-award interest. As noted in
Section VII.D.5.3.3 above, the Parties agree that post-award interest shall accrue at
the same rate and periodicity as pre-award interest.

Because the Tribunal has used 31 August 2016 as valuation date, interest shall
accrue to the Award on damages from the following day, i.e. 1 September 2016.

Accordingly, the Tribunal awards interest on the total amount of damages awarded,
compounded annually, at the rate of LIBOR plus two percent for 3-month
borrowings, which shall accrue from 1 September 2016, i.e. the day following the
date of valuation, until the date of payment.

COSTS

The Tribunal will first provide a summary of each Party's position on costs incurred
in connection with both claims and counterclaims (Sections A and B), before turning
to its analysis (Section C).

A. BURLINGTON’S POSITION

Burlington requests “full indemnification for the costs it reasonably incurred in
pursuing compensation for its losses”.'''? According to Burlington, “an award of
indemnity costs (i) is necessary to give effect to the governing principle of full
reparation, and (ii) is further justified in light of Ecuador's conduct in these
proceedings”. 112°

First, Burlington argues that the principle of full reparation requires that it be
awarded its costs in full. Because compensation must wipe out the consequences of
Ecuador's unlawful acts and restore Burlington to the position it would have been in
had Ecuador not breached the Treaty, “Ecuador's obligation [...] requires not only
the payment of damages representing the value of the assets Ecuador unlawfully
expropriated; it also requires reimbursement of the costs Burlington legitimately
incurred in pursuing that compensation”.''?' As a result, “[alny award that fails to
compensate a successful litigant for the reasonable costs it incurred in pursuing its
claim is not an award of full reparation, but something falling short of that
international law standard”. 1122

For this reason, so says Burlington, “[t]he increasing trend in investment arbitration
is [...] for costs to follow the event”."'? Contrary to Ecuador's contentions, this is not
limited to exceptional circumstances, such as evidence of misconduct. According to
Burlington, the “contemporary approach’ is to shift costs to the losing party. ''*

For Burlington, there can be no question that it is the successful party in this
arbitration. Although each side prevailed on some arguments and lost on others, it
was Burlington who prevailed on the two determinative questions that constitute the
core of the dispute between the Parties, namely (a) whether the Tribunal had
jurisdiction over this dispute and (b) whether Ecuador violated the Treaty. To
allocate costs on an argument-by-argument basis would ignore the fact that
Burlington was forced to spend considerable time and money to recover the
compensation for the unlawful expropriation of its investment.''® According to
Burlington, “[t]he test is not whether all of Burlington's arguments were accepted, but
whether, once it has been established that Ecuador's conduct giving rise to this
arbitration was unlawful and triggered an obligation of full reparation, Burlington's
claims and its associated costs were the natural consequence of Ecuador’s unlawful
conduct”.''?6 Burlington submits that “full reparation requires full indemnification of
those costs — costs that would never have been incurred by Burlington in the
absence of Ecuador's unlawful conduct”.'!?”

Second, Burlington argues that a full costs award is further justified by Ecuador's
conduct in these proceedings. For Burlington, “Ecuador's conduct has exacerbated
and delayed these proceedings at every stage, and has significantly increased the
costs incurred by Burlington”.'"2° In particular, Burlington argues that:

i. Ecuador violated the Tribunal’s order for provisional measures, which in
Burlington’s submission was binding, thus aggravating the dispute, foreclosing
the primary relief requested by Burlington (specific performance of the PSCs)
and showing contempt for the Tribunal.''?® Burlington argues in particular that
“had [Ecuador] complied with the Tribunal’s provisional measures order, a

significant proportion (at the very least) of these proceedings would have been
avoided”. 115°

ii. Ecuador's request to trifurcate these proceedings into separate jurisdiction,
merits and quantum phases added unnecessary expense and delay. ''3"

ii. In addition, Ecuador “asserted manufactured counterclaims, solely in an attempt
to offset the damages it would owe for having breached Burlington's
international law rights’, which gave rise to an additional phase of the
proceedings involving over 1,400 pages of briefs, 7 days of hearings and a 5-
day site visit to a remote location in Ecuador, which was “further prolonged by
Ecuador's insistence on repeatedly re-pleading its case on the basis of alternate
legal, technical and quantum theories”. ''

iv. Ecuador sought a sixth phase of the arbitration through its “baseless motion for
‘reconsideration’, requesting bifurcation twice. Although these attempts to
bifurcate were unsuccessful, they nonetheless caused a “protracted and costly

debate between the parties”.1'95

Further, Burlington denies that the interim decision of the Perenco tribunal on
Ecuador's environmental counterclaim in the Perenco arbitration (the “Perenco
Interim Decision”)''® entitles Ecuador to the costs related to its counterclaims in this
arbitration. No tribunal has ever awarded costs on the basis of another tribunal's
interim decision. Even if the Perenco Interim Decision were relevant to this
Tribunal’s cost award (quod non), “that decision does not find in favor of Ecuador on
any of its counterclaims, and it certainly does not support a costs award in favor of
Ecuador in this case”.''®> Burlington emphasizes that the Perenco tribunal reserved
its final finding on liability over the counterclaims, and noted that “the remaining
issues are most unlikely to lead to an award of damages anywhere near the amount
claimed by Ecuador”.'"° Burlington also argues that the Perenco tribunal agreed

with many of Burlington’s arguments in this arbitration, “including that (1) Ecuadorian
regulations (and not background values) set the standard for legal harm; (2)
Ecuadorian regulations and practice allow for permanent disposal of drilling mud
and cuttings in on-site mud pits; (3) strict liability does not apply prior to October
2008; (4) delineation is the industry standard method to determine the extent of
contamination; (5) IEMS’s models are unreliable and cannot be used to establish the
extent of contamination; and (6) local remediation costs are applicable”.''9” As a
result, Burlington contends that there are “no grounds for Ecuador's assertion that it
was successful on its counterclaims in the Perenco case, and even less justification
for seeking costs in this case on that unfounded basis”.''* If anything, Burlington
submits that the Perenco Interim Decision “confirms that Ecuador’s counterclaim —
except for the limited US$ 1.09 million that Burlington concedes is due to
Consortium operations — is a largely manufactured claim designed to offset
Burlington's expropriation damages [...]”.11°°

For these reasons, Burlington requests “indemnification in full, pursuant to Rule
28(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, of
costs incurred in this arbitration, in addition to compound interest assessed at a
reasonable commercial rate from the date of the award to the date of payment”.'"°

Burlington alleges that it has incurred in total fees and expenses amounting to USD
48,171,235.14 in these proceedings, broken down as follows:'"4"

i. Fees (including for legal fees, experts and other services) related to the merits
(the Tribunal understands this to mean fees incurred in connection with the
principal claims, including jurisdiction): USD 23,986,145.89;

ii. Expenses related to the merits: USD 2,453,258.53;

iii. Fees (including for legal fees, experts and other services) related to the
counterclaims: USD 16,892,289.00;

v. Advances to ICSID: although in its Submission on Costs Burlington indicates
that it has advanced USD 2,600,000, the Tribunal notes that, as of the date of
this Award, Burlington has advanced USD 3,250,000.

Burlington argues that the costs listed above are reasonable in light of the length
and complexity of the proceedings. Burlington notes that “[t]his arbitration involved
five separate phases — provisional measures, jurisdiction, merits, counterclaims,
quantum and reconsideration — each of which required extensive pleadings and
hearings”, which required a combined total of 30 major briefs totaling over 3,000
pages on highly complex and technical issues (not counting numerous submissions
on procedural matters), accompanied by 18 witness statements and 15 expert

reports, and involving five hearings and one site visit.114
In light of the above, Burlington requests the Tribunal to:

Lal

(e) ORDER Ecuador to pay all of the costs and expenses of this
arbitration, including Burlington’s legal and expert fees;

(f) ORDER Ecuador to pay compound interest on the sum awarded in
(e), above, until the date of effective and complete payment, at such a
rate and for such a period of compounding as the Tribunal considers
just and appropriate in the circumstances; and

(g) AWARD such further and other relief as the Tribunal considers
appropriate”. 14°

B. Ecuapor’s POSITION

Ecuador's submissions on costs distinguish the costs pertaining to the principal
claims (1), those pertaining to Petroecuador (2), and those pertaining to the
counterclaims (3).

1. Costs related to the principal claims

With respect to the costs incurred for the principal claims, Ecuador's primary
position is that it should recover all of these costs because “Ecuador is the clearly
successful party” in respect of these claims.''“4 Ecuador submits that, ‘in the event
the Tribunal reconsiders its unlawful expropriation holding, or finds that Burlington’s

1150

1151

behavior contributed to its loss to such an extent as to negate or significantly reduce
compensation, Burlington’s unmeritorious case falls away and Ecuador will have
fully prevailed in this matter’.''45 As a result, applying Burlington’s own standard, it is
entitled to recover all of its costs related to the principal claims. Ecuador claims in
this respect a total of USD 13,429,238.96 in legal and expert fees and expenses, ‘4°
and 100% of the costs of the arbitration (i.e. the Tribunal’s fees and expense and
ICSID’s administrative expenses), as apportioned by the Tribunal to the principal
claims,''*” plus simple interest on any costs awarded at the “commercially
reasonable rate of LIBOR + 2%, or alternatively at another commercially reasonable
rate, from the date of this Award until payment”. 148

Alternatively, Ecuador contends that even if the Tribunal were to reject Ecuador’s
Motion for Reconsideration and its argument that Burlington contributed to its own
losses, there is no clear successful party in these proceedings because each side
will have prevailed on certain issues. With one exception (Ecuador's intervention in
the Blocks), all of Burlington’s claims were found to be either inadmissible, outside
of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or simply meritless.''° In addition, Ecuador contends
that the Tribunal found the expropriation to be unlawful only because of Ecuador's
failure to pay or offer compensation, and Burlington has inflated the amount of
compensation during these proceedings. As a result the Tribunal should apply the
“pay your own way” rule, so that Ecuador should bear only its own legal and expert
fees and expenses, and half of the costs of the arbitration.''®° According to Ecuador,
this has been the practice of ICSID tribunals,''®' who have departed from it only in

Id. 7.
As further broken down in Annex 2 of Ecuador’s Submission on Costs.

Ecuador's position with respect to the advances paid by the Parties to ICSID is that, as these
advances are meant to cover the Tribunal’s fees and expenses and ICSID’s administrative
expenses, the Tribunal is in a better position to apportion them than the Parties. As a result,
Ecuador only specifies the percentage that it seeks to recover in each proceeding. R-
Submission on Costs, § 4. The Tribunal notes that the total amount advanced by Ecuador to
ICSID is USD 2,950,000.

exceptional circumstances.'®* Ecuador notes in particular that tribunals have
applied the “pay your own way” rule in circumstances similar to those of this case, in
cases where claimants have only partially prevailed on jurisdiction and the
merits,'"®° where the State was liable for some treaty violations but not others, ''®
and even when the claimants have won all their claims, but recovered a monetary
compensation much lower than the amount claimed.''®° For Ecuador, this would be
no different to applying Burlington’s “modern rule in favor of cost shifting” onto the
losing party.° Only in rare circumstances have tribunals shifted 100% of the costs,
and in Ecuador’s submission the circumstances of this case do not justify such a
shift.1197

Accordingly, Ecuador submits that “as the clearly successful party”, it “is entitled to
recover 100% of its costs incurred in connection with the principal claims, plus
simple interest at LIBOR + 2%, or alternatively at another commercially reasonable
rate, from the date of the Award until payment. Alternatively, each Party should ‘pay
its own way’ and Ecuador should bear no more than its own legal and expert fees
and expenses and one-half of the costs of the arbitration (i.e., Tribunal fees and

2. Costs incurred by Petroecuador

Ecuador submits that, in any event, Petroecuador (who is represented by the
Procuraduria General del Estado for these purposes) is entitled to recover all of its
costs, “as it fully prevailed over Burlington when Burlington withdrew its claims
against Petroecuador”.''®? In PO2, the Tribunal confirmed that (i) as of 6 November
2009, Petroecuador ceased to be a party to this dispute; (ii) the withdrawal of the
Contract Claims would have an effect on the apportionment of the costs in this
proceeding; and (iii) it would deal with the consequences of the withdrawal of the
Contract Claims on the costs of the arbitration at a later stage, presumably in the

final award.'"®

Ecuador submits that “[iJn light of the withdrawal of Burlington’s claims,
Petroecuador is — without question — the successful party vis-a-vis Burlington”.'"®"
Petroecuador thus claims a total of USD 48,589.72 for the legal fees and expenses
it incurred in its defense against Burlington's claims,''® plus simple interest at
LIBOR plus two percent, or alternatively at any other commercially reasonable rate,
from the date of the Award until payment. ''®

3. Costs related to the counterclaims

Ecuador submits that it is entitled to recover all of the costs pertaining to the
counterclaims as it is the prevailing party on those claims.

With respect to the environmental counterclaim, Ecuador submits that Ecuador’s
position has been vindicated by the Perenco Interim Decision, which according to
Ecuador's makes clear that the Consortium is liable for contamination.''® Ecuador

notes in particular that the Perenco tribunal found that “there is some contamination

in the Blocks for which it is likely that [the Consortium] will be held liable”.11

In any event, Ecuador contends that it is entitled to recover all of these costs
because “Burlington’s obstructionist behavior and its willful concealment of
contamination has forced Ecuador and the Tribunal to incur significant and

unnecessary costs”, and Burlington “deliberately prolonged these proceedings” in

order to hide its liability.'"°° For Ecuador, Burlington’s obstructionist behavior is

evident from the following examples:

Burlington has advanced a formalistic reading of the applicable legislation,
according to which only designated protected zones are considered sensitive
ecosystems. According to Ecuador, this position is absurd and has protracted
the debate between the Parties. ''”

Burlington disputed the presence of contamination on the basis that it was not
visible, when its own witness, Mr. Saltos, testified that environmental incidents
had taken place but that traces of contamination were not visible. This forced
Ecuador (through IEMS) to undertake a costly and extensive investigation to
measure the extent of the contamination in the Blocks. '®

Burlington portrayed the Consortium as a “model operator”, forcing Ecuador to
carry out detailed and costly site assessments to determine the real
environmental condition of the Blocks. These site assessments disproved
Burlington’s assertion that all significant incidents had been dealt with in a
timely fashion and disclosed to the authorities. After reviewing similar
evidence, the Perenco tribunal concluded that the Consortium’s “claims of
strong environmental law compliance are not made out”, and that “there is some
evidence that [the Consortium] was less than forthcoming in some

instances”.''7°

iv. Burlington relied on GSI, whose “utter disregard and manipulation of data”,
“inappropriate sampling methodologies” and “inadequate delineation based on
insufficient and unreliable data” required additional effort and costs from
Ecuador and its experts.''”’ Ecuador argues that its criticism of GSI has been
vindicated by the Perenco tribunal. ''7

In light of the above, Ecuador contends that Burlington and its expert have been
compelled to acknowledge that the Consortium’s operations caused contamination
within the Blocks. Ecuador notes in particular that “Burlington has recognized that
37,555 m° require remediation in 17 sites”, and as a result “it may no longer pretend
that the Consortium has not caused significant negative impact to the Blocks”.''”°

As a result, Ecuador submits that it is entitled to all costs related to the
counterclaims, regardless of the volume of contamination.''”4 For Ecuador, because
Burlington’s obstructionist behavior “unnecessarily and unacceptably” forced
Ecuador and the Tribunal to incur increased costs in the counterclaims phase,
Burlington should now pay for this.''”°

Contrary to Burlington’s contentions, Ecuador submits that the Perenco Interim
Decision is relevant for purposes of allocating costs in this arbitration for at least
three reasons:

i. Should the Tribunal accept Ecuador's counterclaim in its entirety, Ecuador
would be the “clearly successful party” and would be entitled to recover all of its
costs. The Tribunal could take the Perenco Interim Decision into account in
coming to this decision.'17°

ii. Should the Tribunal accept Ecuador’s counterclaim only partially but decide that
there is no clearly successful party, Ecuador contends that the Perenco Interim
Decision provides a basis for a full order on costs against Burlington, regardless
of the volume of contamination for which Burlington is held liable or the ultimate
costs of remediation awarded by the Tribunal. For Ecuador, the Perenco

tribunal’s findings confirm that Burlington did not comply with environmental
standards and concealed the contamination in the Blocks. Were the Tribunal
not to award costs to Ecuador on this basis, “this would send a message to the
international community that an investor can pollute the lands of a Host State,
hide such pollution, avoid remediating it, and yet not bear any costs for such
egregious conduct”.'1””

iii. Even if the Tribunal should reject Ecuador's counterclaim in its entirety, the
Perenco \nterim Decision demonstrates that Ecuador's counterclaim was
justified and reasonable, and as such provides grounds for the Tribunal to
conclude that Ecuador should bear no more than its own legal and expert fees
and costs and half of the costs of the arbitration allocated by the Tribunal to the
counterclaims proceedings. ''8

Ecuador also submits that it is entitled to its legal and expert fees and costs related
to the infrastructure counterclaim. Ecuador contends that it is “clearly the successful
party” with respect to this claim,''”? as it has “thoroughly demonstrated that the
Consortium did not follow the best standards and practices in the oil industry,
establishing through contemporaneous evidence that the equipment and
infrastructure were in a sub-standard state because the Consortium did not have
any preventative or predictive maintenance plans and simply operated under a ‘run-
to-failure’ strategy”.'®° By contrast, Ecuador alleges that Burlington has not
provided any contemporaneous evidence of the Consortium’s alleged maintenance
practices, and its other defenses fail. "8!

In the alternative, should the Tribunal find that there is no clearly successful party,
Ecuador submits that Burlington should be ordered to pay all costs incurred by
Ecuador in connection with the infrastructure counterclaim, because “Burlington’s
blatant denial of the poor state of the infrastructure — notwithstanding clear evidence
of wide-scale breaches of the Consortium’s obligations under the Participation

Ecuador claims for all of its costs in connection with the counterclaims, including

Burlington with its Reply, specifically, Olguin v. Republic of Paraguay,''®® Renée

expressed in Olguin and Levy, namely that a claimant's procedural conduct may
require it to contribute to the costs of the proceedings despite it having been
successful in its claims, ''®* and that “a finding of abuse of process justifies an award
of costs against the unsuccessful party”.'"®? That being said, Ecuador “disagrees
that these principles have any bearing in its regard, however, and strongly disputes
Burlington's characterization of Ecuador's behavior in this proceedings”.''% By
contrast, Ecuador denies that the principle for which Burlington cites Hrvastka

C.  ANALYsis
1. Applicable standards

The Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration between the
Parties, including legal fees and expenses, as it deems appropriate pursuant to
Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, which provides:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and
by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award”.

The Parties have not disputed this discretion.

In the exercise of this discretion, investment tribunals have tended to apply one of
two main approaches to the allocation of costs. Some tribunals have been guided by
the principle of “costs follow the event” and have thus awarded all or part of the
costs to the prevailing party.'*8° Other tribunals have split the costs of the arbitration
between the parties and ordered each party to bear its own costs.''* Some
tribunals effectively apply a mix of the two approaches, starting from one and
mitigating its results with the other, or considering a series of factors to be taken into
account to award costs. 115

In the Tribunal’s view, the apportionment of costs requires an analysis of all of the
circumstances of the case, including to what extent a party has contributed to the
costs of the arbitration and whether that contribution was reasonable and
justified.''°° This analysis should start by considering whether a party has prevailed

119) (holding that “the question of costs is within the discretion of the Tribunal with regard,
on the one hand, to the outcome of the proceedings and, on the other hand, to other relevant
factors”). See also: Funnekotter v. Zimbabwe, Award of 22 April 2009, § 147 (Exh. CL-150).

See, for instance: Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary, |CSID Case No. ARB/07/19,

on its claims, and if it has prevailed only in part, whether the rejected claims were
reasonable or frivolous. ''%” It should also take into account the procedural conduct
of the parties, and in particular whether such conduct delayed the proceedings or
increased costs unnecessarily. The Tribunal notes that both Parties appear to be in
agreement with these main principles: each Party considers itself to be the
prevailing party, and as such seeks the recovery of all of its costs. In addition, each
Party considers that the other party's conduct justifies a full award of costs in its
favor.

In the Tribunal’s view, after a consideration of all the relevant circumstances, the
principles above may be adjusted to take into account that the respondent is a
sovereign State. In particular, it considers that, even if a tribunal finds that a State
has breached its international obligations vis-a-vis an investor, consideration must
be given to the State’s motives and good faith. In particular, where the actions of a
State have been guided by its good faith understanding of the public interest and the
State could reasonably doubt that it was breaching its international obligations, the
Tribunal may consider it appropriate to apportion costs in a manner that alleviates
the burden on the respondent State. These considerations apply to situations in
which the State is the respondent, not the claimant.

The Tribunal will be guided by these principles when apportioning costs. The
Tribunal will first address the costs incurred by Petroecuador (2), and will then
address the bulk of the Parties’ costs pertaining to the claims and counterclaims (3).

2. Costs incurred by Petroecuador

Ecuador submits that, as a result of the withdrawal of claims by the Contract
Claimants (also referred to as the Burlington Subsidiaries), Petroecuador is the
prevailing party with respect to those claims and must recover all of its costs,
amounting to USD 48,589.72.

th[e] case”) (Exh. EL-299).

University Press, 2°¢ edition, 2009), p. 1233 (“Even the cases in which tribunals declined to
award costs indicate a growing awareness of the principle that the losing party should bear
the consequences in terms of costs also”) (Exh. EL-370).

In PO2, the Tribunal stated that it was “aware that the withdrawal of the Contract
Claims will have an effect on the apportionment of the costs in this proceeding, and
will deal with that issue at a later stage, presumably in the Final Award”. ''9°

Applying the principles outlined in the preceding sections, the Tribunal considers
that Burlington must bear Petroecuador’s costs in full. Petroecuador was only a
party to these proceedings because the Contract Claimants had brought the
Contract Claims’? against it. As a result of the withdrawal of the Contract
Claims, '°° Petroecuador ceased to be a party in these proceedings. '2°' While the
Contract Claimants also ceased to be parties in these proceedings for the same
reasons'? and can no longer be ordered to cover Petroecuador’s costs, the
Tribunal deems it appropriate for Burlington, as the Contract Claimants’ controlling
shareholder, to bear this burden.

Ecuador has requested simple interest at LIBOR plus two percent on awarded
costs, from the date of the Award until payment. For the reasons set out in Section
VII.D.5.3.3 above, the Tribunal considers that LIBOR plus two percent for three
month borrowings is an appropriate interest rate. Also for the reasons set out in that
section, the Tribunal is of the opinion that this amount must be compounded
annually. In this case, because costs are fixed on the date of the Award and do not
depend on the date of valuation of the compensation due to Burlington, interest will
accrue from the date of the Award, as requested, until the date of payment.

3. Costs pertaining to the claims and counterclaims

Both Parties seek recovery of all of their costs pertaining to the claims and
counterclaims. Alternatively, Ecuador requests that it be required to bear only its
own legal and expert fees and expenses, and half of the costs of the arbitration
(ICSID and Tribunal fees and costs).

In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to order the
Ecuador to bear 65% of the costs of the arbitration (Burlington bearing 35%), and for
each Party to bear its own legal costs and expenses, for the following reasons.

First, Burlington prevailed on its claims, in the sense that the Tribunal upheld its
jurisdiction and found that Ecuador had breached the Treaty. That said, the Tribunal
also found that it lacked jurisdiction over many of Burlington’s claims, found other
claims inadmissible, and held that several of Burlington’s claims were meritless.
Similarly, the Tribunal rejected two out of three of Burlington’s damages claims and
some of its legal and financial assumptions, with the result that the compensation
awarded to Burlington is 25% of the amount claimed.

On the other hand, while Ecuador also prevailed on part of its counterclaims, the
amount awarded to Ecuador is an extremely small percentage of the amount
claimed. Contrary to Ecuador's contention, the Tribunal does not consider that the
Perenco Interim Decision provides grounds for a full award of costs to Ecuador on
the counterclaims, regardless of the extent of contamination. The Tribunal is not
bound by the Perenco tribunal's findings of fact or holdings of law. Although as
previously noted the majority believes that it must pay due consideration to earlier
decisions of international tribunals, °° the Perenco tribunal's decision does not form
part of a series of established cases to which this Tribunal should defer. In any
event, as Burlington correctly points out, the Perenco tribunal has not yet ruled on
the Consortium’s final liability, and its decision provides support for some of
Burlington's arguments.

More importantly, the Tribunal considers that its decision on the apportionment of
costs must be made on the basis of the circumstances of these proceedings alone.
On the basis of the record before it, the Tribunal has found that, while the
Consortium did not always comply with the applicable environmental standards, the
actual contamination attributable to the Consortium was nowhere near as extensive
as Ecuador alleged, nor were the remediation costs as high as Ecuador claimed.

Second, while the Tribunal agrees with Burlington that Ecuador’s procedural
conduct increased the length and cost of the proceedings, the Tribunal finds that
Ecuador's procedural requests were generally reasonable under the circumstances.
Ecuador's request for a trifurcation of the proceedings into separate jurisdiction,
merits and quantum phases was not unreasonable in light of the complexity of the
claims, which at that time also included claims of the Burlington Subsidiaries.
Further, given the lack of clarity in the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules as to
whether a tribunal may reconsider a pre-award decision, it cannot be held

See: paragraph 44 above. See also: DoJ, J 100; DoL, § 187.

247

633.

634.

635.

illegitimate for Ecuador to have filed a Motion for Reconsideration. Ultimately, that
motion was heard jointly with the quantum phase and did not require a separate
phase. And while the delay and expense caused by the counterclaims phase may
be considered to have been disproportionate to the amount awarded, such
disproportion is somewhat mitigated by the public interest that underlies Ecuador's
environmental counterclaim, namely the protection of the Amazon rainforest, which
represents a major stake in the survival of mankind.

Having assessed all of these elements, and in the exercise of its discretion in
matters of cost allocation, the Tribunal deems it reasonable for Ecuador to bear 65%
the costs of the arbitration (ICSID and Tribunal fees and expenses), and for
Burlington to bear 35% of those costs.

By contrast, the Tribunal finds it appropriate for each Party to bear its own legal and
expert costs. In addition to the reasons given above, the Tribunal notes that
Burlington’s costs, in particular with respect to the claims, are significantly greater
than Ecuador's. Differences in disputing parties’ costs are to be expected, as they
essentially depend on the litigation choices that a party may make to advance its
case. The disparity of the levels of costs between the Parties here is an additional
reason for which the Tribunal finds it appropriate for each Party to bear its own legal
and expert fees and expenses.

OPERATIVE PART

For the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal:

A. Denies Ecuador’s Motion for Reconsideration of the Decision on
Liability;

B. Denies Ecuador’s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility
advanced in this phase;

C. On quantum:

1. Orders Ecuador to pay to Burlington the amount of
USD 379,802,267 together with interest, compounded
annually, at LIBOR for three month borrowings plus two
percent, which shall accrue from 1 September 2016, until
payment;

248

2. Declares that the Award is net of income and labor
participation taxes and that Ecuador may not impose or
attempt to impose income and labor participation taxes on
the Award;

D. On costs:

1. Burlington shall bear the entirety of Petroecuador’s costs in
the arbitration and is therefore ordered to pay Petroecuador
the amount of USD 48,589.72, together with interest,
compounded annually, at LIBOR for three month borrowings
plus two percent, which shall accrue from the date of this
Award until payment;

2. Ecuador shall bear 65% of the costs of the arbitration as
determined by ICSID’s final financial statement, and
Burlington shall bear 35% of those costs;

3. Each Party shall bear its own legal and expert costs;

E. Dismisses all other claims.
