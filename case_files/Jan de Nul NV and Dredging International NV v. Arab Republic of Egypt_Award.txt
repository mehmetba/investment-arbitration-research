PROCEDURE

THE PARTIES
The Claimants

The Claimants in these proceedings are (i) Dredging International N.V. (the “First
Claimant’) and (ii) Jan de Nul N.V. (the “Second Claimant’) (collectively the
“Claimants’).

The First Claimant, Dredging International N.V., is a company incorporated under
the laws of Belgium with its registered office at Scheldedijk 30, B-2070 Zwijndrecht,
Belgium.

The Second Claimant, Jan de Nul N.V., is a company incorporated under the laws
of Belgium with its registered office at Tragel 60, B-9308 Hofstade-Aalst, Belgium.

The Claimants are the two partners of the Joint Venture DI-JDN Suez, an
unincorporated joint venture (the "Joint Venture" or “JV"), entered into for the
purpose of jointly performing dredging operations in the Suez Canal under a
contract awarded by the Suez Canal Authority (the “SCA”), an Egyptian State
entity.

The Claimants are collectively represented in this arbitration by Prof. Antonio
Crivellaro and Prof. Luca Radicati di Brozolo, BONELLI EREDE PAPPALARDO, Via
Barozzi 1, 20122 Milan, Italy.

The Respondent
The Respondent in this arbitration is the Arab Republic of Egypt (“Egypt”).
Egypt is represented in this arbitration by

. Dr. Iskandar Ghattas, Under Secretary, Ministry of Justice; Dr. Mostafa Abdel
Ghaffar, Director of International Cooperation, Ministry of Justice; Mr. Hosam
Abdel Azim, President of the Office of State Litigation; Mr. Osama Mahmoud,
Office of State Litigation, and;

. Messrs Robert Saint-Esteben and Louis-Christophe Delanoy, BREDIN PRAT,
130, rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, 75008 Paris, France.

PROCEDURE LEADING TO THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION

On 23 December 2003, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration (the
“Request’) to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(‘ICSID” or the “Centre”), accompanied by nine exhibits (Exh. C-1 to C-9). In the
Request, the Claimants relied upon the provisions of the 1977 and 2002 bilateral
investment treaties (“BITs”) between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union and
Egypt and sought the following relief:

CLAIMS FOR DECLARATORY DECISIONS IN THE PRINCIPLE
1. The Claimants seek an Arbitral Award:

. acknowledging that the Respondent induced the Claimants
to make an investment in Egypt by negotiating in bad faith
and by fraudulently misrepresenting facts of crucial
relevance to the evaluation of the cost of the investment by
the Claimants;

. acknowledging that the Respondent has failed to promptly
repair the resulting damages by adequate compensation
and that all its organs have constantly disregarded the
Claimants’ rights to a just remedy;

. therefore, declaring that the Respondent has breached its
international obligations under the agreements between it
and Belgium, and notably the obligation to ensure fair and
equitable treatment and full protection and security to
foreign investments.

MONETARY CLAIMS

1. In addition, the Claimants request that the Arbitral Tribunal award
to them complete compensation for all the damages suffered as a
result of Egypt's breaches of its international obligations.

2. These damages include in particular:

. the difference between the fair value of the investment
made by the Claimants and the much lower amount
received in partial compensation therefore, amounting at
least to US$74 million;

. the amount unduly retained and expropriated by SCA in
relation to the subject-matter of the Second Case
amounting at least to US$2,890,370 (US$1,148,816.61 plus
EGP 5,244,659.82);

. the amount of the legal fees and other costs incurred by the
Joint Venture during the unfair and futile judicial
proceedings before the Egyptian domestic courts,
amounting approximately to US$4,500,000;

. the amount of the financial damages suffered by the
Claimants to be calculated by applying to the total amount
of damages indicated above a 9% compound interest
running from June 30, 1993 (the central point of the
performance period of the works) until actual payment by
the Respondent. The rate of 9% is the proper rate already
applied to an amount due by Egypt in a previous ICSID
case;

The exact amount of the damages will be determined more
precisely during the proceedings.

3 In addition, the Claimants request that the Respondent be ordered
to reimburse them for all costs incurred and to be incurred by
them in connection with the present arbitration, including legal
fees.

On 14 January 2004, the Centre transmitted a copy of the Request to the
Respondent and to the latter's Embassy in Washington, D.C, in accordance with
Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and
Arbitration Proceedings (the "ICSID Institution Rules").

Exchanges of correspondence ensued between the Parties and the Acting
Secretary-General of ICSID concerning the jurisdiction of ICSID over the Request
and its registerability under Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the "ICSID
Convention") and ICSID Institution Rules 6 and 7.

On 27 May 2004, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with ICSID
Institution Rule 7, notified the Parties of the registration and invited them to proceed
to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.

By letter of 17 June 2004, the Centre acknowledged that the Parties agreed “that
there shall be three arbitrators, one appointed by each party and the third, who
shall be the president of the Tribunal, appointed by the two party-appointed
arbitrators”.

On 29 June 2004, the Claimants appointed Professor Pierre Mayer, a national of
France, as arbitrator. On 18 July 2004, the Respondent appointed Professor
Brigitte Stern, a national of France, as arbitrator. On 7 September 2004, the Centre
informed the Parties that the two party-appointed arbitrators had appointed
Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as the President
of the Tribunal.

On 14 September 2004, the Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule
6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration
Rules”), notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their
appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the
proceedings to have begun on that date. The same letter informed the Parties that
Ms. Aurélia Antonietti, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Parties were later informed on 31 August 2006, that Mrs. Claudia Frutos-
Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would act as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), and after consulting with the
Parties and the Centre, the Tribunal scheduled a first session on 10 November
2004 in Paris. By letters of 28 and 29 October 2004, the Parties communicated to
the Tribunal the agreements they had reached on procedural matters identified in
the provisional agenda for the first session, which had been sent to them by the
Tribunal’s Secretary.

Consequently, the Arbitral Tribunal held its first session on 10 November 2004, at
the offices of the World Bank in Paris. At the outset of the preliminary hearing, the
Parties expressed agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted
(Arbitration Rule 6) and stated that they had no objections in this respect. The
Parties reiterated their agreement on the points communicated to the Tribunal in
their letters of 28 and 29 October 2004, and the remainder of the procedural issues
on the agenda for the session were discussed and agreed upon, including two
alternative procedural calendars depending on whether or not the Respondent
would raise objections to jurisdiction. Minutes were drafted, signed by the President
and the Secretary of the Tribunal, and provided to the Parties, as well as to the
Members of the Tribunal on 29 November 2004.

In accordance with Arbitration Rule 22, the Parties in particular agreed on the
following arrangements in respect of the procedural language:

. The Parties will file their written submissions and make their oral
arguments either in English or in French without any translation
needed.

. Any communication, decision, order or award issued by the

Tribunal will be rendered and the record of the proceeding will be
kept in English. At hearings, the Tribunal will use the English
language and might also use the French language when
appropriate.

. [...] all instruments including without limitation supporting
documentation, as well as witness statements and expert
opinions, would be filed either in French or English without
translation. Documents filed in Arabic shall be filed together with
an English or a French translation.

(Minutes of the First Session, at No. 7).

In accordance with the preliminary procedural calendar agreed upon during the first

session, the Claimants submitted their Statement of Claim on 15 March 2005

(“SoC”), accompanied by 155 exhibits (Exh. C-10 to C-164), including two witness

statements (Mr. Jacques Albert (Exh. C-18) and Mr. Pierre Tison (Exh. C-46)). In

their SoC, the Claimants invoked the provisions of the BITs and sought the
following relief:

[...] subject to later amendments during the proceedings, the Claimants
seek an award:

. declaring that Egypt has violated its obligations under the First
and Second BIT;
. ordering Egypt to compensate the damage caused to the

Claimants; and therefore

. ordering Egypt to pay to the Claimants the amounts of US$
76.531.040 and € 3.307.008,47, plus interest starting from the
dates and at the rate claimed in Section 12.3 above; and

. ordering Egypt to bear the entirety of the costs of the present
proceedings.
By a letter dated 13 April 2005, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it
intended to raise objections to jurisdiction.

Consequently, on 18 April 2005, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
(PO#1) which set the calendar for the jurisdiction phase of the proceedings.

Following written submissions and a hearing, on 16 June 2006, the Tribunal
rendered its Decision on Jurisdiction, in which it held that it had jurisdiction in the
following terms:

a) The Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to
it in this arbitration.

b) The Tribunal will, accordingly, make the necessary order for the
continuation of the proceedings on the merits.

c) The decision on costs is deferred to the second phase of the
arbitration on the merits.
The Decision on Jurisdiction, a copy of which is attached to the present Award and
made an integral part of it, is further addressed in Chapter IV.1.2 below.

PROCEDURE LEADING TO THE AWARD ON THE MERITS

On 11 August 2007, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (PO#2) setting the
calendar for the merits phase of the proceedings as follows:

Accordingly, the procedural calendar on the merits shall be as follows:
- The Claimants shall file their Memorial by November 15, 2006;

. The Respondent shall file its Counter-memorial by February 15,
2007;

. The Claimants shall file their Reply by April 20, 2007;
. The Respondent shall file its Rejoinder by June 25, 2007;
10

24.

25.

26.

27.

28.

- A pre-hearing telephone conference shall take place on July 10,
2007 at 5 pm, Paris time;

. A hearing for the examination of witnesses and/or experts will
take place on September 25 and 26, and, if necessary, on
September 27, 2007;

. The oral arguments on the merits will take place on October 17,
and if necessary on October 18, 2007.

In accordance with the procedural calendar set in PO#2, the Claimants submitted
their Memorial on the Merits on 15 November 2006 (Mem.) together with Exhibits
C-171 to C-175, including the supplemental witness statement of Mr. Gideon Hein
(Exh. C-171), and a statement by Mr. Hosni Abdelwahed (Exh. C-174).

In accordance with the procedural calendar set in PO#2, the Respondent submitted
its Counter-Memorial (CMem.), entitled “Mémoire du 15 février 2007” accompanied
by five exhibits (Exh. R-2 to R-7), including a witness statement by Mr. Abdel
Hamid Y. Salman (Exh. R-4), an expert report by Messrs. Christian Brossard and
Pierre Taillé (Exh. R-5), and a legal opinion by Prof. James Crawford ("Crawford
Opinion 1", Exh. R-6).

The Parties requested an extension of time for the submission of their respective
remaining pleadings by letters of 10 April and 11 April 2007. On 16 April 2007, the
Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal had no objections to
modifying the remaining schedule for the second round of submissions.

In accordance with the Secretary's letter of 16 April 2007, on 11 May 2007, the
Claimants submitted their Reply (Reply) together with exhibits C-176 to C-187,
including five witnesses statement (Messrs. Marc Stordiau, H. L. Taverne, Hosni
Abdelwahed, Jacques Albert and Pierre Tison, Exh. C-177 to 180), a legal opinion
by Prof. Giorgio Sacerdoti (Exh. C-176) and two experts opinions by Messrs.
Volker Patzold and Richard Nicholas Bray (Exh. C-181 and C-182).

On 31 May 2007, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to dismiss a request made by
the Claimants in their Reply that the opinion given by Mr. Taillé and filed as Exhibit
R-5 be declared inadmissible and his expert report struck from the record. The
Claimants contended that Mr. Taillé was not impartial having been a member of the
board of DEME (Dredging International) which knew of the contract in dispute in
the present proceedings. After an exchange of letters and the filing of new exhibits
on both sides (Exh. C-192 and Exh. R-8), the Tribunal dismissed the Claimants’
request in Procedural Order No. 3 (PO#3) of 9 July 2007:

29.

30.

31.

32.

23. Whereas the Tribunal is mindful of the Claimants’ allegations and
of their significance, it believes that they are not of such nature as
to make the report co-authored by Mr. Taillé inadmissible at this
stage. The Tribunal first notes that Mr. Taillé is just one of two co-
authors of the report and that no objection was presented against
his co-author Mr. Brossard.

24. The Tribunal further takes into account that the Claimants will
have an opportunity to cross-examine Mr. Taillé at the hearing. On
the basis of such oral testimony, the parties may then comment
on the value of Mr. Taillé’s evidence and the Tribunal will be in a
better position to assess such value and to decide what weight to
give to Mr. Taillé’s evidence, if any.

25. This ruling is made without prejudice to any later determination on
the evidentiary weight or relevance of the report co-authored by
Mr. Taillé and of his oral testimony.

In accordance with the Secretary’s letter of 16 April 2007, the Respondent
submitted its Rejoinder (Rej.), entitled “Mémoire du 16 juillet 2007”, accompanied
by 5 exhibits (Exh. R-9 to R-13), including a witness statement by Mr. Abdel Hamid
Y. Salman (Exh. R-9), observations by Messrs. Brossard and Taillé (Exh. R-10), a
legal opinion by Prof. Hossam El-Ehwany (Exh. R-12), and a further legal opinion
by Prof. Crawford ("Crawford Opinion 2", Exh. R-13).

In accordance with the calendar set in PO#2, on 10 July 2007, the Tribunal held a
telephone conference with the Parties in preparation of the hearings for the taking
of evidence and for oral arguments. The main content of the telephone conference
was reflected in Procedural Order No. 4 (PO#4) of 20 July 2007.

In accordance with the calendar set during the above-mentioned telephone
conference, the Parties submitted on 20 July 2007 their lists of witnesses and
experts to be called at the evidentiary hearing.

The Arbitral Tribunal held the evidentiary hearing from 25 to 27 September 2007 in
Paris. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary, the following

In Procedural Order No. 6 (PO#6) of 29 October 2007, the Tribunal settled certain
matters with respect to the correction of the transcripts and set dates for the filing of
the post-hearing briefs.

In accordance with the calendar set in PO#6, as modified by the letter of the
Secretary of 19 December 2007, the Parties filed simultaneous first post-hearing
briefs on 20 December 2007 and simultaneous second post-hearing briefs on 17
January 2008.

The Parties further filed submissions on costs on 11 March 2008 and their
respective comments by 26 March 2008.

On 15 October 2008, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed pursuant to
Rule 38(1) of the Arbitration Rules.

Regarding the admissibility of the expert report and testimony of Mr. Taillé (see
{28 above), the Parties did not comment further pursuant to PO#6. During the
hearing, it turned out in particular that, contrary to the Claimants' allegation, Mr.
Taillé had not personally applied for a position with the Claimants. Having heard
the Parties and the testimony of Messrs. Stordiau and Taillé, the Tribunal came to
the conclusion that Mr. Taillé was not biased. Consequently, the Tribunal decided
not to strike Mr. Taillé's written and oral evidence from the record.

MAIN FACTS

The dispute before this Tribunal relates to a project to dredge the Suez Canal, one
of the most important waterways in the world, to allow for the passage of larger
vessels. To implement this project, the Suez Canal Authority (the "SCA"), the
Egyptian agency in charge of the operation of the Canal, launched an international
tender process. After a series of incidents, the process eventually ended with the
award of the project to the Claimants, which are among the leading dredging
companies worldwide. The SCA thus entered into a contract with the Claimants for
the deepening and widening of certain southern stretches of the Canal. In the
course of the dredging works, the Claimants encountered a volume and distribution
of the materials to be dredged and a proportion of rocks that differed significantly
from their expectations. They sought additional compensation. As the SCA refused
to pay more, the Claimants filed actions in court in accordance with the contractual
dispute resolution clause. They mainly claimed that the contract was null and void
for fraud or error. After proceedings that lasted about ten years, the competent
court essentially dismissed the actions. The Claimants appealed to the higher court
and approximately five months later initiated this treaty arbitration.

This chapter sets forth the main facts of the dispute. It starts with the tender
process (1), continues with the performance of the contract (2) and ends with the
proceedings before the Egyptian Courts (3). Additional facts may be addressed in
the Tribunals analysis if appropriate.

THE TENDER STAGE

The SCA is a public agency, which was established by Law No. 30/1975 (Exh. C-
9). Its mission is the management, maintenance and development of the Suez
Canal.

On 19 March 1991, the SCA invited the Claimants, together with 21 competing
international dredging companies, to submit their pre-qualifications for the widening
and deepening of “some southern regions of Suez Canal” (Exh. C-11) in order to
accommodate vessels with draught up to 56 or 68 feet.

First tender

On 18 February 1992 (Exh. C-13), the SCA then invited the pre-qualified
companies to submit by 3 May 1992 offers for two sets of lots, namely lots (1) and
(1-1) from km 150,000 to km 162,250 starting from the Port Said lighthouse, and
lots (3) and (3-1) from km 122,200 to km 134,500 (Exh. C-13).

The main specifications of these lots were the following:

e Lot (1) was for vessels with draught up to 68 feet, requiring a widening of the
Canal by 70 meters to the East and a deepening down from -20.50 meters to
-25 meters (from a reference level referred to as the datum level), with a
period of execution of 46 months.

e Lot (1-1), which was a part of lot (1), was for vessels with draught up to 56
feet, requiring a widening of 20 meters to the East and a deepening down to
-20,50 meters from the datum level, with a period of execution of 15 months.

e Lot (3) was for vessels with draught up to 68 feet, requiring a widening of 60
meters to the East and a deepening down from -20.50 meters to -25 meters,
with a period of execution of 36 months.

e Lot (3-1), which was a part of lot (3), was for vessels with draught up to 56
feet, requiring a widening of 20 meters and a deepening of up to -20.50
meters, with a period of execution of 15 months.

1.1.1. The tender documents

The tender documents received by the Claimants on 8 March 1992 (Exh. C-14 and
C-15) contained information regarding the hardness and the volumes of the soil to

17

be dredged. As it will be explained below, the Parties disagree on the relevance

and accuracy of these tender documents.

50. The main documents regarding the composition of the soil provided by the SCA

were the following:

A soil report for lots (1) and (3) setting forth the results of a campaign
during which 37 boreholes were dug in 1975-1976 ("the 1975 Raymond
Campaign") and of a seismic survey conducted in 1975 by EG&G
Geophysical Ltd. for Raymond International Inc. (Exh. C-14(a)).

Plan 10433 of February 1992 entitled “Soil Characteristics from km
122.00 to km 135.00, km 150.00 to km 162.250” which contains
longitudinal sections for the layers of the soil in the area of the boreholes
just mentioned (Exh. C-14(b)).

Four drawings showing longitudinal sections of the layers of soil in the
contracted area based on a “high resolution seismic reflection survey”
carried out in 1976 by by EG&G Geophysical Ltd. for the SCA (Exh. C-
14(c)).

A soil report for lot (1) with 7 drilling studies of boreholes from 20 meters
to 25 meters allegedly made by the SCA in 1988 (actually done in 1987)
submitted to the bidders on 31 March 1992 (Exh. C-14(d)), stating that
major constituents of subsurface soil are “calcareous sand, calcareous
silty clay and highly weathered limestone”.

51. The main documents regarding the volume of soil to be dredged provided by the

SCA were the following:

e Plan No. 10401 of February 1992 showing the general plan of the site of the
Works (Exh. C-15(a)).

e Plan No. 10402 of February 1992 entitled “Profiles and Tolerances for Side
Slopes and Widening Works” (Exh. C-15(b)). Plan 10402 indicated a
"theoretical existing" East side slope 3/1, an “actual existing" East side

slope, and a "new theoretical" East side slope.

e Plan No. 10432 of February 1992 entitled “Sedimentation Basins between
km 149,000 km 162,250” (Exh. C-15(c)) gave “an idea of the topography of
the eastern bank’ (Art. 4 of the Specifications).

18

55.

56.

e Plan No. 10431 of February 1992 entitled “Lot ‘1’ between km 150,000 and
162,250, Detailed Plan and Cross Sections” showed the cross sections of
the Canal for the two alternatives (Lot (1) and (Lot (1-1)) (Exh. C-15(d)).

On 14 April 1992, the bidders met with the SCA. Faced with a request for a one
month extension of time to carry out a soil investigation presented on 16 March
1992 (Exh. C-16) and a request for different documents including a bathymetric
survey, the SCA merely stated that it had no other information available than the
one already provided to the bidders.

Further to that meeting, on 20 April 1992, the SCA sent additional information to
the bidders regarding tax and prices together with a document called a “drawing to
indicate the eastern boundary line of dredging” and “samples for canal profiles and
bathymetric survey” (Exh. C-19). The samples included five new drawings of cross
sections of the Canal resulting from a bathymetric survey carried out by the SCA
for kms 125, 128, 150, 153 and 157. The SCA stated that these samples were “to
be considered as a mere indication and S.C.A is not to be held responsible for any
discrepancy”. In the same communication, it added that the “closing date” would be
3 May 1992, thereby impliedly rejecting the JV's request for a one month extension
to carry out a soil investigation.

1.1.2 The bidders’ offer
a) The investigations of the bidders

Prior to submitting its offer, the JV carried out two main investigations: a boring
campaign and a bathymetric and seismic survey. The Parties to this arbitration
dispute the nature, the relevance and the adequacy of these investigations.

The bidders commissioned two companies, MISR Raymond Foundation and the
Site Investigation Bureau (SIB), to undertake an on-shore soil investigation
campaign for lots (1) and (3) and delegated to one of the bidders, Boskalis, the task
to assist the SIB. The boring campaign lasted from 11 April to 19 April 1992 and
was aimed at verifying the results of the 1975 Raymond campaign (Exh. C-20). The
bidders thus used the same consultant as in 1975, Raymond, to drill boreholes in
proximity of those of 1975.

The bidders also commissioned a Dutch company, GeoCom Groep B.V., to

perform a bathymetric and seismic survey of lots (1) and (3) in April 1992 (the

“GeoCom Report”, Exh. C-20 and C-168). Whether this survey was actually a
19

60.

61.

62.

bathymetric survey and to what extent its results could be used is a matter in
dispute, as will be shown below.

b) The Claimants’ offer

On 2 May 1992, the Claimants submitted their first offer (Exh. C-21). The following
day, that offer was ranked first for lot (1) and second for lot (1-1) (Exh. C-22).

On 1 June 1992, the Claimants together with the other bidders met with the SCA
upon the latter’s request. According to the Claimants, the SCA announced during
that meeting that it intended to receive the lowest offer for each couple of lots (i.e.,
lots (1) and (1-1) or lots (3) and (3-1)) from a single bidder. According to the
Respondent, the bidders had quoted prices which were too high in comparison to a
feasibility report it had obtained previously from a Dutch firm, named The
Netherlands Engineering Consultants or Nedeco, to which the Tribunal will revert
below, because they expected to find less than the 100% of the dredging volume
specified by the SCA. As a result, the SCA made a second call for tenders in which
it guaranteed at least 80% of the estimated dredging quantities (WS Salman, Exh.
R-4, 721).

Second tender

In the second round of tenders, a new bid form was issued on 3 June 1992 for lots
(1), (1-1), (3) and (3-1) (Exh. C-27). Two other lots were added, namely lot (3’) and
more importantly lot (1’) from km 150,000 to km 162,250.

Lot (1’), which is the lot at stake in this dispute, involved widening the Canal by 45
meters on the East slope and deepening the Canal bed from -20.50 meters to -
25 meters, with a volume to be dredged estimated at 17,6 million m®, the execution
time being 35 months.

A cross section entitled “Profiles of Alternative Options 1’ and 3”, drawn and signed
by Mr. Salman, bearing the date of 3 June 1992, was attached to the bid (Exh. C-
27).

The cover letter to the bid referred to the guaranteed minimum quantity to be
dredged and the related pricing in the following terms:

1. According to article (35) of General Clauses and Conditions S.C.A
guarantees that the minimum quantities to be dredged shall not be less
than 80% from the indicated quantity.

20

63.

64.

1.3

65.

Accordingly, the contractor is requested to submit two unit prices as
follows:

a) First unit price for the quantity of 80% from the total volume.

b) Second unit price for the quantities exceeding above mentioned limit
(assuming that the mobilization and demobilization cost is calculated on
the guaranteed quantities).

(Exh. C-27)

The Claimants submitted their second bid on 4 June 1992 (Exh. C-28), i.e. two
days in advance of the deadline. They also referred to the minimum quantity to be
dredged and to their related assumption with respect to the minimum widening of
the Canal:

Our calculations are based on the ‘profiles of alternative option 1' & 3”,
attached to your new Bill of Quantities, and which we consider to firm an
integral part of the tender documents. We have assumed that in
accordance with article 35 of General Clauses and Conditions, the
quantities to be dredged shall not be less than 80 % of the indicated
quantity and that therefore the minimum widening of the canal will be 36
m (45 m x 0,8).

(Exh. C-28)
On 6 June 1992, the Claimants’ offer was ranked first for lot (1) and second for
both lots (1-1) and (1’) (Exh. C-29). Two days later, the SCA announced a third
round of tenders (Exh. C-31).

Third tender
1.3.1. The tender documents

The third tender was issued on 22 June 1992. It covered only lot (1’) (Exh. C-32)
and called for offers to be submitted by 27 June 1992. The specifications of lot (1')
were the same as in the second tender, or in the words of the SCA:

1) The zone to be dredged is located between Km 150.000 to Km
162.250.

2) The approximate volume to be dredged is about 17,600,000 m®
(seventeen millions six hundred thousand cubic meters).

3) The dredging works required involves:
3/1 — Widening the canal by dredging the east bank to distance
of 45.0 m (Measured between theoretical slopes).
3/2 — Deepening the channel bed to a depth of -25.00 m.
measured under the corresponding datum level in the area (a
cross section is attached).

(Exh. C-32)

As the second bid, the third one requested two unit prices.

1.3.2

The Claimants submitted their offer for lot (1’) on 27 June 1992 (Exh. C-33) for a
price of LE 8,579,200 and USD 65,507,200. The Claimants’ offer provided for the
use of two powerful dredgers (by the name of "Marco Polo" and "Amazone") with a
total power of 70,000 HP on the cutter-heads for a period of twelve months.

The Claimants allege that their bid assumed a total volume to be dredged of 19.5
million m°, out of which 3% were hard material with a proportion of widening to
deepening of approximately 64% to 36%. These assumptions allegedly meant that

The Claimants’ offer

the works could be completed in 12 months:

1.3.3

According to the Respondent, the Claimants offered two unit prices (Exh. C-33):

The amount of these two volumes added up to 17,600,000 m*, out of which 80%

(i)

(ii)

(ii)

(iv)

(v)

the quantity of hard material was in the order of 3% of the entire
volume to be dredged, and therefore the operations could proceed
speedily and without excessive wear and tear on the equipment;

the total volume to be dredged — on which the total price
(calculated by the agreed unit rate) depended — was
approximately 19,5 million m®, as confirmed by the fact that the
existing profiles of the embankment to be widened were shown by
SCA to be uniform and parallel;

of this volume, approximately 64% was widening and
approximately 36% was deepening, which allowed (a) widening to
continue even when deepening had to be suspended because of
convoy traffic, and (b) deepening and widening to proceed in
parallel essentially on the same cross-sections of the Canal,
thereby avoiding idle time or the need to reposition the dredgers
back and forth along the Canal;

as a result of (iii) above, no unproductive time would have been
caused by the transit of convoys along the Canal;

consistent with all the above assumptions, the duration of the
Works (and the presence in Egypt of the equipment) would not
exceed 12 months.

1.3.4 The award of the third tender to the Claimants

The Claimants’ offer was the lowest and ranked first (Exh. C-34). Consequently,
the Respondent awarded the Contract for lot (1’) to the Claimants on 30 June 1992
(the "Contract"; Exh. C-35). The Contract was executed on 29 July 1992 (Exh. C-7)
together with the General Clauses and Conditions for widening and deepening of
the Canal (the "GCC") (Exh. C-5) and the Specifications (Exh. C-6).

According to the GCC, the Contract was concluded for a fixed price and no
increase was foreseen, it being the responsibility of the bidders. The relevant parts
of the GCC (Exh. C-5) read as follows:

Article 5 — Closing date for tendering

Before submitting his offer, each tenderer must under his full
responsibility, take all necessary steps and make all required
investigations to be able to estimate exactly the nature and extent of his
obligations. Having submitted an offer he will be deemed fully aware of
all servitudes inherent in the execution of the works.

The Contractor alone is qualified to solve all difficulties arising during the
execution of the works, whether these difficulties were foreseen or not at
the time of tendering. Consequently, the Contractor will not be
entitled to any increase in the prices of his offer or to any
indemnity or compensation whatsoever, on account of these
difficulties or of any other unexpected circumstances or for
additional expenses incurred, or for any error or omission which
may be found in the documents of the Contract or in any other
information received by the Contractor. In short, contract prices
must include and cover all risks, responsibilities and obligations of
the Contractor. (Emphasis added)

[-]
Article 59 — Currency — Prices

[-]

Prices include, this to be taken as a mere annunciation and not a
limitation, the expenses for study and transport; all supplies of plants
and materials expenses for labour, workshops insurance; incidental and
overhead expenses of the Contractor in Egypt and abroad; social
insurances; the Contractor's profits and generally all expenses incurred
by the Contractor for the execution of the works defined in the
Specifications and of anything resulting therefrom during their execution,
until the final reception.

Prices for earthwork and dredging shall be valid whatever the
nature of the soil extracted, even should this soil contain obstacles
such as angle irons, reinforced concrete or steel sheet piling,
concrete debris, rubble, etc.. and whatever the means of extraction,
the distance of transport and the level of the spoil and the

ion of the ially those
from the Sclonation of the Canal.

These prices also include the interruptions due to navigation in the
Canal, those necessary for the shifting of the dredges or of the spoil

23

72.

evacuating pipelines; those needed for lubrication, repairs or accidents;
those caused by stones or debris from the revetments or other waste;
unless otherwise stipulated in the Contract.

However in certain cases, to take into account fluctuations in the basic
elements of expenses concerning dredging works, the Contract may
provide for an increase or a reduction of the rates for dredging by means
of a coefficient calculated according to a formula defined in the Contract.
(Emphasis added)

The Specifications provided for the description of the project for lot 1’ (widening by
45 m between the existing slope (theoretically at 3/1) and a new theoretical slope at
3/1 and deepening by 25 m) as well as the estimated volume to be dredged
(17,600,000 m® out of which 14,080,000 m? were guaranteed). The Specifications
also addressed the nature of the soil to be dredged and the possibility of
encountering hard rock during dredging. The relevant parts of the Specifications
(Exh. C-6) read as follows:

Article (2): Object:

The following specifications pertain to dredging operations to be carried
out in the Canal between Km 150.000 & Km 162.250 as hereafter
described and shown on drawings No. 10401, 10402, 10431 &
10432 named as Lot (1’) consists of:

- Widening the Canal by dredging the Eastern side slope by about
45.00 m

- Deepening the Canal bed to 25.00 m below datum level.

Estimated volume of soil to be dredged in Lot (1') amounts to about
17,600,000 m*. This quantity is approximate and given as an indication
of the volume of the work.

According to Article (35) of the General Clauses and
Conditions, the Authority guarantees that 'the minimum quantity
to be dredged shall be not less than 80% of the above indicated
quantity (i.e. 14,080,000 M’), accordingly two different unit prices
are indicated in the Contract.

(a) First unit price for the 80% of the total quantity (14,080,000 M°)
guaranteed quantities.

(b) Second unit price for the quantities exceeding the above
mentioned limit (assuming that the mobilization & demobilization
costs will be covered totally by implementing the guaranteed
quantify). (Emphasis added)

Article (7): Widening and deepening of the Canal: - Lot (1’):
The approximate volume of dredging is 17,600,00 m’°, of which

14,080,000 m° is guaranteed. The zone to be dredged is located in
general plan No. 10401.

- Detailed drawing No. 10431 shows the limits of the site, the
general layout and the cross section of the Canal.

24

- The part to be dredged for widening is situated between the
existing slope (theoretically at 3/1) and a new theoretical
slope at 3/1.

- However if it is found that the side slopes will not be appropriate
at 3/1, the Authority and the Contractor will decide suitable slopes
by mutual agreement.

- The distance between these two slopes measured at a depth of
11m under datum level will be 45.00 m.

The detailed drawings for the new curves will be handed to the
Contractor in due time. The starting points, the ends and the widening
of the new curves may differ slightly from those shown above. Between
Km 157.550 and Km 161.050, the new theoretical slope is to be
extended till it meets the existing natural beam of the channel. The
Contractor has to dredge the bed of the widened channel between
Km 150.000 and Km 162.250 to a depth of 25.00 m measured under
the corresponding datum level. (Emphasis added)

Article (9): Working schedule and means of execution:

The Contractor has to submit to the Authority — within one month
following the Contract signing date — a detailed time schedule for the
execution of the work and a complete description of all installation and
equipment he proposes to use.

The Contractor may propose whatever equipment and system of
evacuation of spoil he thinks suitable.

Taking into consideration the nature of the soil to be dredged,
cutter suction dredgers having mot jess than 2000 HP on the cutter
an well to be ployed in
anditnon to other types of dredgers of suitable power.

However, the acceptance by the Authority of the time schedule and the
proposed means of execution shall not diminish the obligation of the
Contractor, who remains solely and entirely responsible for the
execution of the work in the time stated in the Contract.

If during the work it is found that the equipment proposed by the
Contractor and accepted by the Authority is not sufficient to finish the
work in the contracted time, then the Contractor must, on his own
expense and on his own responsibility, take the necessary steps to
substitute or add new equipment in order to speed up the work.
(Emphasis added)

Article (12): Hard rock encountered during dredging:
The Contractor must extract all types of soil including rock,

sand, clay, gy etc. the of the
strata and difficulties he may encounter during dredging.

 

In the event of a thick strata of hard rock being encountered during the
work, which cannot be cut and removed by the Contractor's dredgers
employed on the site, then the Contractor must procure the necessary
equipment to break and remove these hard strata.

The Authority will not consider the work completed until the specified
profiles and depths are attained.

The existence of such rocky strata will not however entitle the
Contractor to any increase in the unit price or to an extension of
the time of execution.

25

The Contractor declares that the unit prices for dredging works
mentioned in the Contract will cover completely all the difficulties that he
will encounter due to the hard strata whatever may be the amount and
degree of hardness of it.

He guarantees to execute the dredging work completely and adequately
so that the new slopes and depths correspond to those specified in the
Specifications, without leaving any parts above the required profiles,
whatever difficulties in dredging may be encountered. (Emphasis added)

73. The Contract also provided a description of the project and of the volume to be
dredged over 35 months. In pertinent parts, the Contract (Exh. C-7) reads as
follows:

Article (1): Purpose of the contract:

The Contractor agrees to carry out for the Authority, in accordance with
the Specifications and Drawings attached to this Contract, the works
pertaining to:

Lot (1’): about 17,600,000 m*:

Widening the Canal by dredging the eastern bank by a distance of about
45.00 m and deepening Canal bed to -25.00 m under datum level
between Km 150.000 and Km 162.250 comprising the dredging and
removal of about 17,600,000 m® of spoil. This quantity is approximate
and given as indication of the work volume.

According to Article (35) of the General Clauses and Conditions the
Authority guarantees that the minimum quantity to be dredged shall not
be less than 80 % of the above indicated quantity (i.e. 14,080,000 m’),
accordingly two different unit prices are indicated in the contract:

a) First unit price for the 80 % of the total quantity (i.e. 14,080,000 m*)
guaranteed quantity.

b) Second unit price for the quantity exceeding the above mentioned limit
(assuming that the mobilization and demobilization will be covered totally
by implementing the guaranteed quantity).

 

The Contractor agrees to execute the work mentioned in article (1) of
this Contract in accordance with the stipulations of the Specifications,
within a period of 35 months (thirty five) starting from the Contract
signing date.

However, if the total volume dredged is over or under the estimated
volumes indicated in the same article, the period of execution will be
increased or decreased on a prorata basis.

2. THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT

74. The works started in October 1992 and were completed on 5 May 1994 (Exh. C-
80), taking 7,5 months more than the Claimants expected when they submitted
their third offer (see § 67 above).

26

79.

As provided in the Contract, from late September to early November 1992, the
Claimants carried out a joint in-survey, i.e., a bathymetric survey, with the SCA
from km 150,000 to km 162,500 (Exh. C-37). The Claimants wrote to the SCA as
early as 21 November 1992 that the widening of the Canal was less than 45 meters
and that the deepening was less than 4.5 meters, thus resulting in a lower
production rate and reserved the right to claim additional compensation (Exh. C-
38). The SCA answered on 5 February 1993 that the Contractor was not entitled to
any compensation (Exh. C-44).

The Claimants contend that they encountered conditions during the performance of
the dredging works that were not mentioned at the tender stage, namely a lesser
volume to be dredged, an imbalance between the deepening and widening
operations, and a higher proportion of rock. The Respondent denies such
contentions.

There is common ground, however, on the fact that the Claimants finally dredged a
total amount of 14,564,706 m®, and that the SCA had pre-dredged certain parts of
the lot prior to the tender without expressly disclosing that fact during the tender
process. Whether the Claimants could or should have known about the pre-
dredging will be discussed below.

Consequently, on 4 April 1993, the Claimants submitted to the SCA a request for
"compensation of additional costs" (Exh. C-63). On 11 May 1993, they sent the
SCA a comparison between the tender theoretical quantities/SCA soil conditions
and the actual in survey quantities/soil conditions. The main conclusions were that
the volume of hard material had increased from 3% to 43% and that the quantity of
volume to be dredged was reduced by 5 million m? from 19.5 million m* to 14.5
million m® (Exh. C-72). On 29 May 1993, the Claimants submitted to the SCA a
formal claim for extra-compensation (Exh. C-73), which was rejected in July 1993
(Exh. C-74) on the basis of Articles 5 and 59 of the GCC and Articles 9 and 12 of
the Contract mentioned above.

On 29 June 1994, the SCA accepted the works and issued a certificate of
provisional and final reception for the dredging of lot (1°) (Exh. C-81).

THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE EGYPTIAN ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS
The two actions brought by the Claimants

On 17 July 1993, the Claimants brought proceedings against the SCA before the
Administrative Court of Port Said pursuant to the dispute resolution clause
contained in the Contract’ (Exh. C-83) (the “First Case”). Relying on Articles 120°,
121°, and 125‘ (error and fraud) of the Egyptian Civil Code, the Claimants
requested the Court (i) to declare the Contract null and void on account of the
SCA’s acts and omissions during the negotiation of the Contract and (ii) to award
compensation for all expenses and losses incurred during the performance of the
works, plus lost profits, the total cost of the works being assessed at USD 130
million. In July 1993, the Administrative Court of Port Said transferred the First
Case to the Administrative Court of Ismailia.

On 9 December 1995, the Claimants filed a second action against the SCA before
the Administrative Court of Ismailia seeking relief for a series of deductions made
by the SCA from the amounts to be paid under the Contract (Exh. C-114) (the
“Second Case”). The SCA was said to have made arbitrary deductions from the
monthly payments due under the Contract for an amount of USD 2.9 million in
relation with administration charges, customs duties on equipment and regulatory

Article 22 of the Contract reads as follows: “Any dispute, difference or controversy, which may arise

between the parties related to the interpretation, application, implementation or effect of this Contract

which cannot be resolved amicably, will be settled by the Egyptian courts, according to Egyptian

laws”. (Exh. C-35)

Article 120 of the Egyptian Civil Code reads:

"A contracting person who falls in significant error may ask for nullifying the contract, if the other

contracting party has fallen like him in the same error, or if he was aware of it, or it was easy for him to

detect it". (Exh. C-84)

Article 121 of the Egyptian Civil Code reads:

"(1) An error shall be significant if it is so gross that the contracting party would refrain from
concluding the contract if he did not fall in that error.

(2) An error shall be significant specifically:

a- If is it in the quality of a thing and is considered significant as such by the two
contracting parties, or should be considered as such on account of the surrounding
circumstances of the contract, and the good intention which should exist in dealings.

b- If it is in the contract itself or in any one of its qualities, and that such quality of the
contract itself was the main reason for concluding the deal". (Exh. C-84)

Article 125 of the Egyptian Civil Code reads:

"(1) A contract may be annulled for fraudulence, if the deceits to which one of the two contracting
parties, or which his deputy resorts are so tremendous that the second party would not have
concluded the contract if such tricks had not been there.

(2) Shall be considered as fraudulence a premeditated silence as to a fact or surrounding
circumstances, if it is evidenced the one who fell prey to such fraudulence would not have
concluded the contract if he has been aware of the said fact or the surrounding
circumstances". (Exh. C-84)

customs duties, mooring light, buoy damages, interest charges and certain so-
called arbitrary deductions/retentions.

The First Panel

When filing the First Case, the Claimants (referred to by the Egyptian Courts as the
Joint Venture, the “JV”) requested the appointment by the Court of a commission of
experts. Following the transfer of the First Case to the Administrative Court of
Ismailia, the latter appointed on 6 September 1993 a panel of three experts
specialized in soil mechanics (the “First Panel”) (Exh. C-89). The First Panel's
mission essentially consisted in determining whether soil studies had been carried
out at the tender stage (question 1); what volume had actually been dredged in
terms of widening and deepening (question 2); whether the Claimants should have
foreseen the difficulties encountered (question 3); the effects of the pre-dredging
carried out by the SCA on the Claimants' works (question 4); the losses suffered by
the Claimants and their causes (question 5). More specifically, the Ismailia Court
required the First Panel to answer the following questions:

1. Whether the two companies carried out any soil tests and
boreholes during the period designated for studying the Tender
documents in the light of correspondence exchanged with the
Authority in this regard, while indicating any facilities that may
have been extended to them for this purpose by the Authority?

2. The volume of deepening and widening works respectively
actually executed by the plaintiffs, and the approximate volume of
works still to be executed by them under the contract.

3. Whether the difficulties encountered by the plaintiff companies in
executing the deepening and widening works are among the
difficulties that could have been foreseen from the technical point
of view in the light of the obligations of the two companies as
defined in the contract, in the specifications of contract and its
general conditions and, in particular, in the light of the previous
experience of the two companies in deepening and widening
works.

4. The ratio of deepening and widening works carried out by the
Authority (in the period between notifying the two companies that
they had been awarded the contract on 30/6/1992 up till the two
companies commenced execution) to the total scope of works
under the contract, and to what extent this caused an increase in
the proportion of deepening works to widening works; also, to
what extent this affected the longitudinal sections, the width of the
widening works, the proportion of hard material existing at the
time the two companies presented their bid on the basis of the
information provided by the Authority on the longitudinal sections,
the width of the widening works and the nature of the soil.

5. Whether the two plaintiff companies suffered injuries as a result of
executing the works subject of the contract, while defining the
elements of these injuries, if any, their extent and causes?

87.

From October 1993 to April 1995, the First Panel conducted five meetings with the
parties (Exh. C-116) and received at least fourteen written submissions, including
expert reports.

At the third meeting with the First Panel (Exh. C-97), the SCA filed a report by
Nedeco, which in 1991 had analysed the feasibility of four alternative developments
of the Canal (56, 62, 68 and 72 feet stage) (the "Nedeco Report", Exh. C-98 — R-2).
Both Parties rely on this report in the present arbitration.

The parties to the local proceedings filed their last submissions with the First Panel
in the first half of 1995.

Following an invitation by the Commissaire d’Etat in November 1996, the First
Panel rendered its report on 6 February 1997 (Exh. C-116) and issued the following
conclusions:

There was a difference between the documents provided during the tender and
the actual cross sections on the East shore due to prior dredging works. The
actual profiles from the 1993 campaign showed that the widening works on the
Eastern shore were more extensive than what appeared in the cross sections
that the SCA supplied to the bidders. The SCA should have submitted all the
available information to the bidders. At the same time, the JV should have
conducted a bathymetric survey, the existence of which the Panel was unable to
establish, or requested the actual cross sections from the SCA at the tender
stage (Exh. C-116, p. 30).

The JV should not have based its studies on a dredging volume higher than the
one tendered. The total volume of dredging was higher than the quantity
guaranteed by the SCA.

The difficulties encountered by the JV resulting from the relative imbalance
between widening and deepening were due to the pre-Contract dredging carried
out by the SCA. In the absence of results from a bathymetric survey, such
difficulties could not have been expected.

Pre-dredging works led to an increase in the percentage of rock in the soil to be
dredged, the total rock components amounting to 37%.

Accordingly, the First Panel gave the following answers to the five questions of the
Administrative Court of Ismailia:

30

1. | The Panel was not in a position to determine whether bathymetric surveys
were performed by the JV at the tender stage.

2. The total volume of dredging was less than the total volume referred to in the
Tender Documents, but higher than the quantity guaranteed by the SCA.

3. The JV's claim that it had encountered difficulties due to the decrease of the
dredging volume was without merit, as the total executed volume was higher
than the volume guaranteed. The JV should have conducted a bathymetric
survey pursuant to Clause 5 of the GCC and the SCA should have provided
the JV with the pre-dredging drawings. The difficulties relating to the nature of
the soil were technically unexpected. The volume and hardness of the rock
encountered exceeded the level which could have been foreseen.

4. The SCA had carried out pre-dredging works until March 1991, but not any
more between the notification of the Contract and the commencement of the
works.

5. | There was a lack of information during the tender stage as to the actual
profile of the Eastern side and the nature of the soil and percentage of rock.
The First Panel attributed this lack of information to the JV (absence of a
bathymetric survey information, which JV should have conducted pursuant to
the GCC), to the SCA (the geological survey provided with the tender
documents did not accurately represent the nature of the soil and of the rock),
and to unforeseen conditions (higher volume of rock and rock harder than
expected).

3.3. The Commissaire d’Etat

88.

On 5 February 1996, the Administrative Court of Ismailia requested on its own
motion an opinion in the two cases from the Commissaire d’Etat, who issued such
opinion in September 1997 (Exh. C-118) based on the findings of the First Panel.
The Commissaire d'Etat reached the following conclusions with regard to the First
Case:

- It was established that the SCA’s performance had been deficient pursuant to
Article 121 of the Civil Code: “[TJhe SCA withheld important information from
the JV that was available to it, information which, if the latter had known
about it at the time of signing the contract, would have caused it not to accept
the contract at the prices quoted in its tender’ (Exh. C-118, p. 32).

31

89.

90.

- Due to the SCA’s failure, the JV was entitled to be compensated for the
actual value of the works executed.

- The SCA was not entitled to rely on Article 5 of the GCC and claim that the
contractor had failed to perform the necessary investigations, because it had
given the JV only 8 days, which was insufficient time to conduct the required
studies and surveys. To compensate for the brevity of time, the SCA should
have presented all the documents in its possession, which it failed to do.

- There were unforeseen material difficulties (lesser volume, greater deepening
than widening, and higher percentage of rock than sand) that entitled the
contractor to additional compensation.

- The JV was therefore entitled to recover the costs actually incurred, i.e.,
LE 340,553.90 and USD 66,178,594.16.

In connection with the Second Case, the Commissaire d'Etat reached the following
conclusions:

- The SCA was responsible for the late performance and thus “should not
benefit therefrom by making deductions from the JV's entitlements” (Exh. C-
118, p. 36);

- The JV’s claim for interest for delays in effecting monthly payments was ill-
founded;

- The JV’s claim for 10% administrative charges (customs supervision) was
upheld;

- The JV’s claim for the value of customs taxes for the 2" year of the Contract
was upheld;

- The JV’s claims for the refund of mooring and light charges and deductions
regarding alleged damages to the buoy were upheld;

- As a consequence, the SCA ought to be ordered to pay to the Claimants
LE 5,224,659.82 and USD 755,576.61, plus 4% legal interest.

In his opinion, the Commissaire d'Etat also suggested consolidating the two cases.

The Committee for Settling the Complaints of the Investors

On 30 September 1998, the Claimants resorted to the Committee for Settling the
Complaints of the Investors. Composed of three Ministers and of the Secretary of
the Cabinet of Ministers, this Committee had been established by the Prime
Minister's Decree No. 64 of 1996 to “settle the complaints of investors arising out of
differences between ministries, offices, public authorities, public institution and local
administration units in relation of determining the authority competent to finalize
applications of purchasing and owning the properties owned by the State or to
obtain the necessary licenses to construct and administer projects and other
disputes arising out of application of constructing and/or administering an
investment project” (Exh. C-127, p. 2).

The Committee held two meetings on 11 November 1998 and 28 December 1998
to deal with the Claimants’ complaint. However, the SCA objected to the
Committee's jurisdiction. The proceedings were not pursued beyond the spring of
1999 although no decision had been rendered.

The Second Panel

After the issuance of the opinion of the Commissaire d’Etat in September 1997, the
proceedings resumed before the Ismailia Administrative Court.

In its second statement of defense of 9 March 1998 filed in the First Case (Exh. C-
119), the SCA inter alia challenged the Commissaire d’Etat’s opinion which
allegedly violated the law on many counts and requested that it be disregarded. It
further requested the dismissal of the First Case and alternatively the appointment
of a panel of experts from the Ministry of Justice to find whether the JV had
suffered injuries and to complete the assignment determined by the Court in its first
judgment of September 1993 (Exh. C-119). As for the Second Case, the SCA
asked the Court to dismiss the actions (including for lack of jurisdiction regarding
the buoy claim) (Exh. C-120). Alternatively, it requested the appointment of an
accounting and engineering expert to establish whether the JV was entitled to claim
for delays in payment, a claim that the Claimants waived later in October 1998
(Exh. C-125). As an alternative relief, the SCA requested that the case be
remanded to the Commissaire d’Etat for reconsideration on the basis of a
memorandum filed by the SCA after the Commissaire had rendered his opinion
(Exh. C-137).

99.

According to the record, between March 1998 and November 1999, the SCA filed
nine written submissions (five in the First Case and four in the Second Case) and
the JV six (five in the First Case and one in the Second Case).

Having consolidated the two cases on 24 December 1998 (Mem., 74 103 and 175),
the Administrative Court of Ismailia rendered a judgment on 29 May 2000
dismissing the SCA’s objections to jurisdiction and entrusting the experts’ office of
the Ministry of Justice with the appointment of an expert to review certain elements
of the Second Case (Exh. C-141). Following such decision, the Claimants
requested that the First Case be adjudicated immediately and independently from
the Second Case (Exh. C-142, C-143).

On 12 September 2000, the Court further requested (Exh. C-144) the experts’
office of the Ministry of Justice to appoint a tripartite committee specialized in
engineering and accounting (the Second Panel) in order to supplement the First
Panel's fifth mission regarding the losses incurred by the Claimants and to review
certain elements of the Second Case:

[R]eview the file of the said project and all relevant documents and
undertake the necessary inspection of the works site to determine the
damage elements, assessment of same and causes thereof, if any,
incurred by the plaintiff companies as a result of the contract works. In
total, the completion of the fifth mission set forth in the judgment
rendered by the Administrative Court in Port Said on September 6,
1993, especially the items which were not dealt within the Report of the
Panel of Experts of the faculty of Engineering [First Case], and also to
execute the mission set in the judgment rendered by this Court on May
29, 2000 [Second Case], and to increase the experts fees deposit to LE
2,000 instead of LE 1,000 to be paid by the two plaintiff companies.
(Exh. C-144) (emphasis added)

Once constituted, the Second Panel held a hearing on 12 March 2001 during which
it submitted 15 questions to the parties (Mem., § 113), questions which the
Claimants considered ultra vires. Both parties then filed written submissions and
the Second Panel issued its report in March 2002 (Exh. C-152).

In its Report, the Second Panel revised the findings of the First Panel as well as the
opinion of the Commissaire d’Etat (Exh. C-152). It essentially concluded that the JV
was entitled to USD 8.6 million for excess consumption of pick points:

Firstly:

We found that the J.V. suffered damage from executing the contractual
works, this damage represented in:

. The numbers of pick points consumed due to the percentage of
rocks and sand [...]

34

Accordingly the total damage suffered by the J.V. regarding the pick
points used in the dredging rocks and cemented sand is US$
8622090,7 (eight million six hundred twenty two thousand and ninety
dollars, seventy cents).

Regarding the other damage referred to in the Commissaires d' Etat
and the Faculty of Engineering-Ain Shams University Professor's Panel
reports are not founded. [Exh. C-152, p. 33]

Secondly:

Based on the above [contractual provisions], the J.V. suffered no
damage from executing the Contractual works according to the principle
“The contract makes the law of the parties". [Exh. C-152, p. 34]

100. Regarding the Second Case, the Second Panel found that the SCA was entitled to

some of the deductions and owed the Claimants USD 1,087,997.64 and
LE 212,045.

101. The Report ends with a conclusion entitled "Final Result", which reads as follows:

The contractual works according to the contract dated 29/7/1992
entered between the J.V and the Authority were the widening and
deepening of the Suez Canal between Km 150.00 to Km 162.250.

We clarified in our report the fifth mission set forth in the Judgement
rendered by the Court of Administrative Jurisdiction in Port Said on
September 6th, 1993.

We clarified the following

1) According to the report of the professors of soil mecanics -
Faculty of Engineering - An-Shams University - and the
Commissaires d' Etat report, if the Court elects to follow, the total
damage suffered by the J.V from executing the contractual works
is the amount of US$ 8,622,090.7 (eight million, six hundred
twenty two thousands and ninety USD and seven cents) (pages
31,32,33).

2) Pursuant to the Contract entered between the Parties and
pursuant to our report, there are no damage suffered by the J.V.
from executing the contractual works as "the contract makes the
law of the parties" [p. 34].

According to the preliminary judgement dated 29/5/2000, there are
amounts due to the J.V. which were unduly deducted by the Authority
from the J.V. dues, these amounts are:

1) The amount of US$ 1,087,997.64 (one million eighty seven
thousand, nine hundred ninety seven USD and sixty four cents)

2) The amount of L.E.216,045 (two hundred sixteen thousand and
forty five L.E.) as have been clarified in our report pages 38, 39.

And it is left for the court justice. (Exh. C-152)

102. In April 2002, the Claimants submitted their comments on the Second Panel’s
report to the Court contending that the Second Panel had acted ultra vires as it was
empowered to complete but not to revise the findings of the First Panel (Exh. C-153
and Exh. C-154). The JV also argued that the Panel should not have relied on the
Contract as the Court had not yet adjudicated on the validity or revocation of the

35

103.

104.

latter (Exh. C-153). In August and October 2002, the SCA submitted its comments
on the Second Panel's findings and asked that the case be resubmitted to the
Commissaire d'Etat for the latter to issue a second report (Exh. C-155, Exh. C-156
and Exh. C-157). The parties presented oral arguments on 26 December 2002
(Exh. C-178).

THE DECISION OF THE ISMAILIA ADMINISTRATIVE COURT

The proceedings just described were completed on 22 May 2003, when the
Administrative Court of Ismailia rendered its decision in both cases (Exh. C-158).

In substance on the First Case, the Court declined to annul the Contract for
fraudulent misrepresentation or error and dismissed the claim for extra
compensation, because the Claimants had failed to make the necessary
investigations and had undertaken to perform at the price agreed regardless of the
dredging conditions. Specifically, it held as follows:

It is clear from the aforementioned [art. 5 of the Specifications and 56 of
the GCC] that the Contract wording and the General Conditions were
clear and explicit without any misunderstanding or ambiguity. However,
the material difficulties encountered were related to the soil nature
whereat the project was executed which difficulties are due to
unexpected natural phenomenon. Therefore, the conditions of
annulment of the Contract for fraudulent misrepresentation are not
fulfilled since the Defendant Authority did not have knowledge
about these difficulties encountered by the Claimants during the
execution of the works the subject-matter of the dispute. Therefore,
the Claimants’ request has no basis in law and shall be rejected.
[p.11]

[1

The Administrative jurisprudence established that the contracting party's
rights and obligations with the Authority shall be determined pursuant to
the Contract Conditions entered with the Administrative Authority.
Therefore, the provision agreed upon between the parties in the
administrative contract bind the parties thereto and shall be
applicable and could not be revoked, as what was agreed upon
between the parties is their law whereat their will had met and concluded
upon its basis their rights and obligations. "High Administrative Court
Judgment on Case No. 933 year 33 J hearing 20/4/1993" [p.12]

[1

In light of the above [art. 5 and 12 of the Specifications, art. 59 of the
GCC and 62 days granted to study the tender], the Claimants are not
entitled [sic] allege that there were difficulties encountered by them
during the execution of the Contract as the Claimants should have
performed guiding boreholes and Bathymetric surveys during the
period of studying the tender in order to be aware of the entire
expected and unexpected technical matters. In addition, the
Claimants had obliged themselves by Prices determined for dredging
whatever the nature of soil and frustrations therein. Therefore, the
Claimants request to order SCA to pay the difference between the

36

106.

107.

108.

109.

110.

111.

actual cost of the carried out works and the amounts certified for

payment by the Defendant shall be rejected. [p.13] (emphasis added)
The Claimants were held liable for the costs of the proceedings, the SCA having
prevailed.

With respect to the Second Case, the Court awarded the Claimants USD
1,087,997.64 and LE 216,045, that is approximately one third of the deductions
claimed. The SCA was held liable for the costs of the proceedings of the Second
Case.

The Claimants appealed the judgment on both Cases before the High
Administrative Court of Egypt on 20 July 2003. The SCA also appealed in relation
to the findings of the Second Case (mentioned by the Respondent's legal expert,
Exh. R-12, § 9-10; Rej., § 228). A few months thereafter, on 23 December
2003, the Claimants submitted the dispute under discussion to ICSID.

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

In this section, the Tribunal will summarize the main aspects of the Parties’
positions. It will refer to further arguments and allegations if appropriate in the
course of its analysis.

THE CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants’ case is based on an alleged violation by Egypt of the two
successive bilateral investment treaties between the Belgo-Luxembourg Economic
Union and the Arab Republic of Egypt (respectively the “1977 BIT” and the “2002
BIT”; collectively the “BITs”).

In substance, the Claimants assert that Egypt’s conduct since 1992 constitutes not
only a breach of the Contract and of Egyptian law (as submitted before the
Egyptian Courts) but also a breach of the rules of international law concerning the
treatment of foreign investments, specifically the provisions of the BITs.

In their pleadings on the merits, the Claimants revisited the issue of jurisdiction and

submitted that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the entire dispute before it,

including over breaches predating the entry into force of the 2002 BIT. In reliance

on the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Claimants consider that the jurisdiction of the

Tribunal is primarily based on the 2002 BIT and encompasses facts that took place
37

112.

prior to the judgment of the Court of Ismailia. In the alternative, the Claimants

invoke the 1977 BIT to assert the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over those facts.

On the merits, it is the Claimants’ case that Egypt committed a series of severe

illegalities, namely:

(i)

ti)

It made fraudulent misrepresentations at the tender stage about the scope
and nature of the contract works, thereby inducing the Claimants to a loss-
making investment, and it failed to redress this illegality after the
commencement of the works forcing the Claimants to resort to the local
courts and to incur even more losses (SoC, pp. 126 to 130; Mem., 4 309);

It committed a “gross miscarriage of justice" because of the “inordinate
duration and blatant defiance of the principles of fairness and due process” of
the local proceedings (Mem., {| 317), the behavior of the Egyptian judiciary
amounting to an “abuse of process and obstruction of justice” (Mem., § 318)
In relation with the conduct of the local proceedings, the Claimants have
more particularly insisted on

- “The systematic disregard of all evidence and findings favourable to
the Claimants” (Mem., § 317), the conduct of the proceedings thus
being biased (SoC, p. 130);

- “The joining of the First and the Second Case merely for dilatory
purposes” (Mem., ¥ 317), the joinder being a pretext to overrule the
findings of the First Panel and of the Commissaire d'Etat (SoC,
p. 131);

- | “The appointment of a new and non-independent body of experts by
the Ministry of Justice, as a pretext to overrule the findings
unfavorable to the State” (Mem., § 317);

- “The passive espousal [by the Court] of the unreasoned and ultra vires
conclusions of a panel of technical experts with no legal qualifications
who overruled the fully reasoned findings of the two competent
bodies, the First Panel and the Commissaire” (Mem., § 317), the
judgment having merely rubber-stamped the report of the Second
Panel (SoC, p. 131) and being in flagrant breach of all the rules of
Egyptian law and “the antithesis of due process” (SoC, p. 134).

38

The duration of the proceedings that lasted more than ten years prior
to reaching a decision of first instance, within which the Claimants
especially question the duration of the proceedings before the First
Panel (Reply, {J 231-232).

113. These illegalities are attributable to the Egyptian State, including the acts and
omissions of the SCA, and constitute violations of Egypt's international obligations.

More particularly, Egypt allegedly committed the following treaty violations:

It failed to grant the Claimants fair and equitable treatment pursuant to
Article |.1 of the 1977 BIT and Article 3.1 of the 2002 BIT.

It failed to grant continuous protection and security to the investment
pursuant to Article |.2 of the 1997 BIT and Article 3.2 of the 2002 BIT.

It failed to promote the investment pursuant to Article II.1 of the 1977
BIT and Article 2.1 of the 2002 BIT.

114. On the basis of these contentions, the Claimants request that the Tribunal:

(i)

(ii)

(ii)

Declare that it has jurisdiction over the entire dispute submitted to
it by the Claimants;

Declare that Egypt has violated its obligations under international
law towards the Claimants, rejecting any and all of the
Respondents’ objections and counterclaims; and

Award the Claimants the compensation requested by them for
damages suffered as a consequence of the behavior of Egypt.

(Reply, 293; 2" PHB, 145)

115. In respect of the last relief sought, the Claimants request the following financial
compensation:

(i)

US$73.631.040, equivalent to the difference between the total
amount of the execution costs (i.e. US$139.625.550) and the total
amount paid by SCA under the Contract, i.e. US$ 65.994.510;

€3.307.008,47 for legal costs relating to the domestic judicial
proceedings;

US $2.900.000 for the unlawful deductions made by SCA.

Interest at the rate of 9% p.a. to be compounded quarterly on the
above amounts (starting from June 30, 1993 for the amounts set
out in (i) and (iii) above, and from July 30, 1998 for the amount set
out in (ii) above).

The costs of the present arbitration.

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

For its part, the Respondent considers that the dispute which crystallized on
17 July 1993, that is on the date of the filing of the First Case, is not the same as
the one that crystallized on 22 May 2003, that is on the date of the judgment of the
Ismailia Court. The question to be solved by the Tribunal is whether that judgment
constitutes in itself a violation of the 2002 BIT (CMem., 6 and 210). The
Respondent submits that the judgment does not violate the 2002 BIT, and does not
constitute a denial of justice by reason of its content or of the time needed for the
proceedings. The Respondent further recalls that the Claimants have not
exhausted the available local remedies (Rej., | 255).

The Respondent also claims that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction on facts that took
place prior to the entry into force of the 2002 BIT (such as the SCA’s alleged acts
and omissions) and that it would be an excess of power on the part of the Tribunal
to assert such jurisdiction. In addition, the Respondent contends that it cannot be
held responsible for the alleged wrongful acts of the SCA since the SCA is not an
organ of the Egyptian State (CMem., { 282).

As an alternative, the Respondent contends that there were no misrepresentations
on the part of the SCA and that the case is ill-founded on the merits. It argues that
the Claimants acted in bad faith when entering into the Contract with a view
towards exploiting the existing difference in the Parties’ calculations and filing a
claim for additional compensation (CMem., 4 62), as well as after entering into the
Contract.

Consequently, the Respondent invites the Tribunal to

. Constater que le litige dont il est saisi, né du Jugement, ne peut
porter que sur I'éventuelle illicéité de ce Jugement au regard du
BIT 2002, c'est-a-dire sur l'existence d'un déni de justice, et non
sur l'illicéité de faits antérieurs a l'entrée en vigueur du BIT 2002,
tel le prétendu dol de la SCA ;

- Constater l'absence de tout déni de justice et débouter les
Demanderesses de I'intégralité de leurs prétentions ;

- Trés subsidiairement, si le Tribunal s'estime habilité a statuer
directement sur le grief de dol prétendu de la SCA, constater
l'inexistence de ce dol et, de ce fait, l'absence de toute violation
du BIT 1977 et, a fortiori, du BIT 2002, et débouter en
conséquence les Demanderesses de l'intégralité de leurs
prétentions ;

- En tout état de cause, condamner solidairement les
Demanderesses a lui rembourser l'intégralité des frais qu'elle aura
exposés depuis le début de la procédure pour faire face a leur

(Rej., 1315)

PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATIONS

Before turning to the merits of this case, the Tribunal wishes to address certain
preliminary matters regarding its jurisdiction (1) and the applicable law (2).

JURISDICTION

The Parties have addressed jurisdiction in their submissions on the merits. They
have a different understanding of the Decision on Jurisdiction essentially with
respect to the scope of the dispute before this Tribunal. Therefore, the Tribunal will
firstly summarize the Parties’ positions (1.1), and then restate the outcome of its
determination on jurisdiction (1.2). Doing so, it will be careful not to revisit any issue
which is res judicata.

The Parties’ positions

The Claimants understand the Decision on Jurisdiction to hold that the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal, which is based on the 2002 BIT, encompasses all the facts they
have alleged, including facts that took place prior to the entry into force of the 2002
BIT. In other words, they understand that jurisdiction covers facts from the call for
tenders (Mem., {| 252) to the Judgment of the Ismailia Court as the “last straw of a
crescendo of illegalities which began at the tender stage” (Reply, { 31). Among
these illegalities, in addition to those of the Court of Ismailia, they count the acts
and omissions of the SCA, the Prime Minister, the Committee for Settling the
Complaints of the Investors, the Second Panel of Experts (Reply, §/ 325).

Alternatively, the Claimants consider that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
entire dispute comprising all the facts alleged on the basis of a combination of the

4

124.

125.

126.

127.

1.2

128.

2002 and the 1977 BITs (Reply, {| 18), which offer a continuity of standards of
protection (Prof. Sacerdoti, Exh. C-176 § 18).

Upon the Tribunal’s question, the Claimants specified that the Decision on
Jurisdiction carried res judicata to the extent that the Tribunal had asserted
jurisdiction over the entire set of facts brought before it. By contrast, if the Tribunal
had restricted its jurisdiction to facts arisen after the entry into force of the 2002
BIT, then it still needed to rule on its jurisdiction under the 1977 BIT, a matter left
unresolved which could thus not be res judicata (1st PHB, {| 122).

The Respondent objects that the Decision on Jurisdiction asserted jurisdiction
pursuant to the 2002 BIT over a new dispute which arose after the Ismailia
Judgment. Such dispute cannot extend to facts predating the 2002 BIT, which
provides that it does not apply to “disputes having arisen prior to its entry into force”
(Art. 12 i.f.). It also contends that “the substantive guarantees of the [2002] BIT only
apply to the conduct of Egypt occurring after that date” (Prof. Crawford, Exh. R-6 ¥
12 and Exh. R-13 4 12). Therefore, for the Respondent, the only conduct that can
constitute a breach of the 2002 BIT is the one of the Ismailia Court and any
discussion of a possible attribution of responsibility to Egypt for the acts of the SCA
is inapposite.

The Respondent further objects to the application of the 1977 BIT to which the
Claimants refer in the alternative (Rej, §] 294). It mainly alleges that at the time of
the Request for Arbitration, Egypt’s consent to arbitrate under the 1977 BIT had
lapsed.

Finally, the Respondent asserts that the Decision on Jurisdiction carries res
judicata, the Tribunal having affirmed jurisdiction on the basis of the 2002 BIT over
a dispute that arose at the time of the Ismailia Judgment, which cannot include a
claim for fraud of the SCA (2nd PHB, § 30). In other words, the subject matter of
the dispute so defined is res judicata (Tr. H. p. 86, French version) and cannot be
reopened.

The Decision on Jurisdiction

According to the terms of the dispositif of the Decision on Jurisdiction, "the Tribunal
has jurisdiction over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration". In the conclusion
to the analysis, the Tribunal specified that it had jurisdiction “to decide the present
dispute under the 2002 BIT” ({ 137, emphasis added). The terms "dispute

42

129.

130.

submitted to it" and "present dispute” cannot but mean the dispute of which this
Tribunal is seized, including all the facts alleged. The Decision makes no mention
of certain facts being excluded from the scope of the jurisdiction so asserted. To
the contrary, it emphasizes that the Tribunal has reached its affirmative conclusion
after having “extensively considered’ — and thus affirmed — the question whether a
dispute arising after the Ismailia Judgment “could include claims that do not arise
directly out of the judgment but out of previous facts”. It goes on to consider that
the submissions at this stage of the proceedings were sufficient to establish
jurisdiction and notes that at the merits phase the Claimants would in particular
have to show that the acts of the SCA were attributable to the State ({ 138). Such a
statement would make no sense if the acts of the SCA were outside the scope of
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (see also § 89).

In the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion just set forth,
i.e., that the entire set of facts alleged falls within its jurisdiction under the 2002 BIT,
after having defined the dispute before it and the time when it arose. For purposes
of this definition, it distinguished in terms of parties involved and applicable legal
standards, the treaty dispute brought before it under international law ({{ 116 ff.)
from the contractual dispute brought before the local courts under national law, the
relevant consideration being that “the local dispute antedated the international
dispute and ultimately led to if’ ({ 119). On this basis, it held that the international
dispute only crystallized or arose after the date of the Ismailia Judgment ({ 121),
which together with the conduct of other organs of the State compounded the harm
caused by the alleged fraud of the SCA ({ 118). As a result, the reliance on the
exclusion of disputes arisen prior to the entry into force of the 2002 BIT contained
in Article 12 of such treaty was inapposite and the dispute resolution clause of the
BIT 2002 applied to the whole dispute brought before this Tribunal. Consequently,
there was no reason to review the applicability of the 1977 BIT for jurisdictional
purposes.

Accordingly, the issue of jurisdiction is res judicata. No aspect has been left
unresolved. Hence, having restated the content of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the
Tribunal will abstain from entertaining further arguments put forward by the Parties
after that decision was rendered.

APPLICABLE LAW

Unlike the issue of jurisdiction, the question of the law governing acts that occurred
before the entry into force of the 2002 BIT while forming part of a dispute that arose
thereafter has not been finally determined and will be addressed now.

It is undisputed, and rightly so, that the legality of an act must be assessed in the
light of the law applicable at the time of its performance.® This rule of intertemporal
law is well established in international judicial and arbitral practice.® It is a
consequence of the rule on non-retroactivity, which for treaties is codified in Article
28 of the Vienna Convention in the following terms :

ARTICLE 28
Non-retroactivity of treaties

Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise
established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or
fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the
date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.

The rule that acts are governed by contemporaneous law is also reflected in Article
13 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility ("ILC Articles"), which rules out
responsibility for an act in violation of an obligation not in effect at the time of the
performance of the act :

ARTICLE 13
International obligation in force for a State

An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international
obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the
time the act occurs.

In other words, the Tribunal must apply the provisions of the 2002 BIT with regard
to the acts of the Ismailia Court in relation to its judgment and the provisions of the
1977 BIT with regard to conduct that took place prior to the entry into force of the
2002 BIT. This said, in practical terms the application of different texts will make no

must be appreciated in the light of the law contemporary with it, and not of the law in force at the
time when a dispute in regard to it arises or falls to be settled." (Emphasis added).

meaningful difference as the protections of the two treaties are essentially identical.
The guarantee of fair and equitable treatment is provided in almost identical terms
in Art. | (1) of the 1977 BIT and in Art. 3 (1) of the 2002 BIT. The same is true of the
guarantee of continuous protection and security embodied in Art. | (2) of the 1977
BIT and Art. 3 (2) of the 2002 BIT, as well as of the duty to encourage investments
contained in Art. II (1) of the 1977 BIT and in Art. 2 (1) of the 2002 BIT.

As a result, the substantive provisions of both treaties will apply, while, as it follows
from the Decision on Jurisdiction, the jurisdiction over the dispute is based on the
2002 BIT only. In other terms, as was stressed by Prof. Schreuer, one of the
Claimants’ legal experts, "jurisdiction is independent of the substantive law
applicable to the dispute".”

The application by a tribunal established under one treaty (here the 2002 BIT) of
provisions of another treaty (here the 1977 BIT) implies that the dispute resolution
clause of the first treaty (the 2002 BIT) contains no restriction with respect to the
applicable law and that the acts at issue fall within the scope of application of the
second treaty (the 1977 BIT). The Tribunal will examine these questions in turn.

Article 8 of the 2002 BIT entitles the investor to submit to ICSID "any dispute which
may arise between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting
Party in connection with an investment in the territory of the other Contracting
State". Unlike the dispute resolution clauses of the 1977 BIT and of certain other
treaties®, this wording does not restrict the State’s consent to arbitration of disputes
involving the application of the substantive rules of the 2002 BIT.

Several ICSID decisions, including Salini v. Morocco, SGS v. Philippines and
Impregilo v. Pakistan® have interpreted such broad dispute resolution provisions to
include claims arising from a contract in connection with an investment entered by
an investor with the State, as opposed to being limited to claims of breach of the

Schreuer Opinion, Exh. C-165, § 81.

Art. IX of the 1977 BIT refers to "any disputes relating to a measure contrary to this Agreement [...]".
Further, the NAFTA dispute settlement provision for instance apply only to breaches of certain
obligations under the treaty (Art. 1116); the same is true of the Energy Charter Treaty (Art. 26(1)), or
of the UK Model BIT, which refers to disputes “concerning an obligation of the host state under this
Agreement (Art. 8(1)).

substantive provisions of the treaty containing the arbitration provision. SGS v.
Pakistan in particular has preferred the latter restrictive approach. "°

Absent specific circumstances to the contrary, this Tribunal sees no reason to
deviate from the “ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose”, which is the primary rule of
interpretation under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.
This is particularly so since the BIT embodying the broad clause replaces the
former whose substantive provisions are applicable, with the aim of giving a
continuity of protection of investments made in the territories of the Contracting
States.

Turning now to the scope of application of the 1977 BIT, in the Decision on
Jurisdiction, the Tribunal has already reviewed and affirmed the latter’s application
ratione materiae (see, J 97-104).'' Further, with respect to the scope ratione
personae, there is no doubt that the Respondent is a Contracting State and that the
Claimants are nationals of the other Contracting State. Finally, the question of the
application ratione temporis is resolved by the observation that the 1977 BIT is the
law contemporaneous to the facts, which is the only one that governs acts
performed while it was in force and that may give rise to the responsibility of the
host State.

If need be, this last conclusion is supported by the Commentary to Article 13 of the
ILC Articles. The Commentary specifies that the principle stated in Article 13 is not
only a necessary but also a sufficient basis for responsibility. It adds that “once
responsibility has accrued as a result of an internationally wrongful act, it is not
affected by the subsequent termination of the obligation, whether as a result of the

termination of the treaty or of a change of international law.”

ATTRIBUTION

The Claimants complain about the acts and omissions of a number of different
actors: the SCA, the Prime Minister, the Committee for Settling Disputes of Foreign
Investors, and the Court of Ismailia. It is only if the conduct of these actors is
attributable to the State that Egypt may be held responsible for any treaty breach.

145.

The Decision on Jurisdiction has expressly left the issue of attribution to be
determined at the merits phase because the debate was not exhausted at the
stage of the jurisdictional objections ({{]| 85 and 89). Accordingly, the Tribunal will
first deal with the SCA (3.1) and then turn to the other actors (3.2).

Acts and omissions of the SCA
3.1.1. The Claimants’ position

According to the Claimants, irrespective of its precise characterization, the conduct
of the SCA is attributable to Egypt on the alternative following grounds:

. The SCA is an organ of the State within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC
Articles. For Professor Sacerdoti, the SCA is a de jure organ of the State
since it is a public authority that exercises a public function and is part of the
structure of the State according to domestic law (Prof. Sacerdoti Opinion,
Exh. C-176, 51, 9 57-58).

. The SCA is an entity that exercises governmental authority within the
meaning of Article 5 of the ILC Articles.

. The SCA acts under the control and direction of the State within the meaning
of Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

More particularly, the Claimants argue that the SCA is an organ of the State and
satisfies the structural and functional test set out in Maffezini v. Spain, Salini v.
Morocco and RFCC v. Morocco, as well as Noble Venture v. Romania, Eureko v.
Poland and EnCana v. Ecuador. Even if it were not to be considered a de jure
organ, following Noble Venture v. Romania ({ 69-70), the SCA is in any case a de
facto organ of the Egyptian State according to Professor Sacerdoti ({ 58) in that it
is empowered by law to exercise elements of governmental nature (Mem., 9 219-
230).

According to the Claimants, it is sufficient to satisfy one of these tests — structural
or functional — to attribute the conduct of the SCA to Egypt (Mem., 4 204).
Moreover, the distinction between acta iure imperii and acta iure gestionis plays no
role whatsoever when it comes to the attribution of State responsibility (Reply, ] 94;
Professor Sacerdoti, Exh., C-176, 68). In addition, the fact that the Contract was
an administrative contract is a strong indication that the contracting entity is
engaging the State’s responsibility (Mem., § 241).
47

146.

147.

148.

149.

Applying a structural test, the Claimants put forward that:

(i) SCA is considered a "Public Authority" by Egyptian law (Article 2,
para. 1 of Law No. 30/1975);

(ii) | SCA's Chairman, Directors of the Board, Managing Director and
General Manager are all appointed by means of presidential
decrees of the President of the Republic (who also decides on
their salaries, their removal and their bonuses) (Article 3 of Law
No. 30/1975);

(iii), SCA reports to the Prime Minister, who must also approve all the
decisions of its Board of Directors before they become effective
(Article 2, para. 2 and Article 3, para. 2, of Law No. 30/1975);

(iv) the charges collected by SCA are included in the Public Treasury
Balance Sheet and SCA's accounts and balance sheets are
supervised by the Central Auditing Department, the State organ
exercising financial control over the administration of public funds
(Article 5 of Law No. 30/1975);

(v) all SCA's employees have the status of public officials (Article 13
of Law No. 30/1975);

(vi) SCA is subject to the rules on public procurement which apply to
ministries and State authorities (citation omitted);

(vi) SCA's acts are subject to the judicial review of the administrative
courts, whose jurisdiction is limited to disputes with the
government and government entities (as demonstrated also by
the judicial proceedings discussed in Chapters 4-7 above).

(SoC, pp. 96-97)
The Claimants also apply a functional test. On that basis, they find that the SCA
performs functions that are exclusively governmental in nature and is vested with
typically governmental powers. It has the responsibility of governing and
maintaining the Suez Canal, which is one of the most important waterways of the
world and an essential asset of the Egyptian economy (SoC, p. 97).

The Claimants find further useful indication in the SCA’s budget which shows that
"almost half of SCA's yearly revenues (the "governmental surplus") are transferred
to the Public Treasury every year and that the amount transferred equals almost
one _fifth of the current revenues of the entire State budget’ (Mem., § 215,
emphasis in the original).

As the SCA is the authority mandated by the Egyptian government to administer
the Suez Canal, the Claimants contend that it is also delegated to fulfill Egypt's
international obligations relating to the Canal. The SCA carries out these functions
by issuing decrees and by imposing and collecting charges, which are the most
characteristic manifestations of “puissance publique.” Furthermore,

48

(i) SCA is entrusted with “the management, utilization, maintenance,
improvement of the Suez Canal Utility’ (Article 1 [of Law No.
30/175);

(i) SCA has the exclusive power "to issue the decrees that are
related to the navigation in the canal and any other decrees
required for good performance of the utility and the execution of
these decrees" (Article 6);

(iii), SCA is also responsible for the management of Port Said harbour
and for access to the Canal, for imposing and collecting "charges
for the navigation and passing through the Canal Utility also for
the guidance, towage, anchoring" (Articles 7 and 8);

(iv) SCA enjoys "all the required powers for the performance of all its
duties and competencies, especially it has the right to possess the
land and the real estate by any way’ (Article 9).

(SoC, pp. 97-98)

150. Therefore, there can be no question that the SCA was acting in its governmental

151.

152.

153.

capacities in the context of its relations with the Claimants. The works were a
typical instance of "maintenance” and "improvement" of the Suez Canal for which
the SCA is responsible by law. They were intended to improve the conditions of the
Suez Canal by making it accessible to larger vessels, thereby increasing the
opportunities for revenues of the Egyptian State (SoC, p. 98).

The works were awarded by a tender process governed by the laws on public
procurement, and the SCA's actions throughout the entire duration of its relations
with the Claimants were subject to administrative law and to the typical constraints
of a public authority. This is demonstrated inter alia by the fact that the SCA's
refusal to grant an extension of the tender period was justified by constraints linked
to the State budget and the risk of loss of financing from Arab funds (SoC, p. 99).

In addition, the Claimants submit that the SCA is an entity that exercises
governmental authority within the meaning of Article 5 of the ILC Articles. In the
alternative, the Claimants contend that the SCA also acts under the control and
direction of the State within the meaning of Article 8 of the ILC Articles (Mem.,
231).

3.1.2 | The Respondent’s position

For the Respondent, while it is clear that the Ismailia Court is an organ of the State,
the SCA is not. More particularly, the SCA is not an organ of the State in the terms
of Article 4 of the ILC Articles because it has independent legal personality:

Aucun texte de droit interne égyptien n’assimile la SCA a un organe de
Etat de jure au méme titre que le Gouvernement, le Parlement, les

49

154.

155.

propre.

Tout au contraire, la loi n° 30 de 1975 qui a créé la SCA prévoit
expressément a son article 2 que ‘Suez Canal Authority’ is a Public
authority [which] enjoys an independent Juristic Personality.

Cette personnalité juridique propre exclut que la SCA soit considérée
comme faisant partie intégrante de I’Etat égyptien. (CMem., {J 282-284.
Emphasis in the CMem.).

Referring to Noble Venture v. Romania ({ 69), the Respondent argues that the
existence of an independent personality is the relevant test, this determination
being made pursuant to Egyptian law as long as it is not contrary to international
law (Rej., 4 299).

Regarding the application of Article 5 of the ILC Articles, the Respondent does not
deny that the SCA is entitled to exercise governmental authority, but it contends
that the SCA did not act in this capacity in the particular instance. The tender stage
did not imply the exercise of any governmental authority and the fact that the
Contract is an administrative contract is irrelevant (Rej., § 303). The SCA acted as
a private contracting party (Rej., {| 303-304), as allegedly acknowledged by the
Claimants in the Request for Arbitration, where they consider that the dispute
submitted to the Administrative Court of Ismailia, which is at the root of this arbitral
procedure, was a “private law dispute” between foreign investors and the “SCA
acting in its capacity as a private contracting party” (Request, § 27-3). Accordingly,
while the Respondent acknowledges that the SCA is an entity that exercises
governmental authority pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Articles in certain instances,
it denies that it has acted in this capacity vis-a-vis the Claimants (CMem., 291). It
therefore concludes that the SCA’s acts cannot be attributed to Egypt.

3.1.3. The Tribunal’s determination

The discussion between the Parties primarily hinges upon whether the SCA is a
State organ pursuant to Article 4 of ILC Articles or an entity that exercises
governmental authority pursuant to Article 5 of the ILC Articles. The distinction is of
importance. Indeed, should the SCA be a State organ, any of its acts would be
attributable to the Respondent. Should it be an entity pursuant to Article 5, Egypt's
liability will depend on whether the SCA did exercise elements of governmental
authority vis a vis the Claimants at the relevant time.

50

156.

159.

160.

The ILC Articles have been embodied in Resolution A/56/83 adopted by the
General Assembly of the United Nations on 28 January 2002. This resolution is
considered as a statement of customary international law on the question of
attribution for purposes of asserting the responsibility of a Sate towards another
State, which is applicable by analogy to the responsibility of States towards private
parties.

In order for an act to be attributed to a State, it must have a close link to the State.
Such a link can result from the fact that the person performing the act is part of the
State’s organic structure (Article 4 of the ILC Articles), or exercises governmental
powers specific to the State in relation with this act, even if it is a separate entity
(Article 5 of the ILC Articles), or if it acts under the direct control (on the instructions
of, or under the direction or control) of the State, even if being a private party
(Article 8 of the ILC Articles).

a) Are the acts of SCA attributable to Egypt because the SCA is an organ
of the State (Article 4 ILC Articles)?

The Tribunal will assess whether the SCA is an organ of the State, as contended
by the Claimants, pursuant to Article 4 of the ILC Articles, which reads:

ARTICLE 4
Conduct of organs of a State

I. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that
State under international law, whether the organ exercises
legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever
position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its
character as an organ of the central government or of a territorial
unit of the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in
accordance with the internal law of the State.

In the 2001 Commentary to Article 4 of the ILC Articles it was specified:

(1) | Paragraph 1 of article 4 states the first principle of attribution for
the purpose of State responsibility in international law — that the conduct
of an organ of the State is attributable to that State. The reference to a
“State organ” covers all the individual or collective entities which make
up the organization of the State and act on its behalf. It includes an
organ of any territorial governmental entity within the State on the same
basis as the central governmental organs of that State: this is made
clear by the final phrase. (p. 40)

An organ is part of the central or decentralized structure of the State, which means
that it is a person or entity which is part of the legislative, executive, or judicial

51

161.

162.

163.

13

powers. To determine whether an entity is a State organ, one must first look to
domestic law."® The SCA was created by Law No. 30/1975. It appears that the
SCA is not classified as a State organ under Egyptian law. Article 2 of Law No.
30/1975, embodying the Suez Canal Authority Statutes (Exh. C-9), states that
“Suez Canal Authority is a Public Authority” and that SCA “enjoys an independent
juristic personality.”

Indeed, the SCA was created to take over the management and utilization of a
nationalized activity. There is no doubt that from a functional point of view, the SCA
can be said to generally carry out public activities, as acknowledged by the
Respondent itself. However, structurally, it is clear that the SCA is not part of the
Egyptian State, as results from Articles 4, 5 and 10 of the Law No. 30/1975.
Indeed, these provisions insist on the commercial nature of the SCA activities and
its autonomous budget. They read respectively as follows :

Article 4

The SCA shall follow the appropriate methods of management and
exploitation in accordance with what is being followed in the business
enterprises without any commitment by the governmental systems and
conditions.

Article 5

The SCA shall have an independent budget that shall be in accordance
with the rules adopted in the business enterprises without prejudice to
the supervisory of the Central auditing Department on the final account
of the SCA.

Article 10

The SCA's funds are considered private funds.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the SCA is not an organ of the
State, and that, as a consequence, its acts cannot be attributed to Egypt.

b) Are the acts of SCA attributable to Egypt because the SCA is a public
entity having exercised governmental authority functions (Article 5 ILC
Articles)?

Article 5 of the ILC Articles reads as follows:

ARTICLE 5

166.

Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of
governmental authority

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State, under
article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise
elements of the governmental authority [“a exercer des prérogatives de
puissance publique”, in the French version] shall be considered an act of
the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in
that capacity in the particular instance.

In other words, for an act to be attributed to a State under Article 5, two cumulative
conditions have to be fulfilled:

- first, the act must be performed by an entity empowered to exercise
elements of governmental authority (i);

- second, the act itself must be performed in the exercise of governmental
authority (ii).

The issues before the Tribunal are therefore whether the SCA (i) is empowered to
exercise elements of governmental authority under Egyptian law and, if so, (ii) if it
has exercised such authority vis a vis the Claimants at the time of the tender, i.e.,
at the time of the alleged fraud (dol), as well as during the performance of the
Contract. The Tribunal will examine these two questions in turn.

(i) Is the SCA empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority?

The test to determine if an entity falls within the scope of application of this
provision is limited to the exercise of governmental authority. Indeed,

[t]he fact that an entity can be classified as public or private according to
the criteria of a given legal system, the existence of a greater or lesser
State participation in its capital, or, more generally, in the ownership of
its assets, the fact that it is not subject to executive control — these are
not decisive criteria for the purpose of attribution of the entity's conduct
to the State. Instead, article 5 refers to the true common feature,
namely that these entities are empowered, if only to a limited extent
or in a specific context, to exercise specified elements of
governmental authority.

There is no doubt that the SCA was and still is empowered to exercise elements of
governmental authority. This is clearly acknowledged by the Respondent (CMem.,
{| 286). The SCA is in particular empowered “to issue the decrees related to the
navigation in the canal’ (Article 6 of the Law No. 30/1975) or to “impose and collect

168.

169.

170.

charges for the navigation and passing through the canal (Article 8). The Tribunal
therefore concludes that the SCA is an entity under Article 5 of the ILC Articles.

(ii) Did the SCA exercise governmental authority in its dealings with the SCA?

It is common ground that for an act of an independent entity exercising elements of
governmental authority to be attributed to the State it must be shown that the act in
question was an exercise of such governmental authority. '®

Relying on the functional test adopted by the Maffezini tribunal, this Tribunal “must
establish whether specific acts or omissions are essentially commercial rather than
governmental in nature or, conversely, whether their nature is essentially
governmental rather than commercial. Commercial acts cannot be attributed to the
State, while governmental acts should be so attributed”."®

Consequently, the fact that the subject matter of the Contract related to the core
functions of the SCA, i.e., the maintenance and improvement of the Suez Canal, is
irrelevant. The Tribunal must look to the actual acts complained of. In its dealing
with the Claimants during the tender process, the SCA acted like any contractor
trying to achieve the best price for the services it was seeking. It did not act as a
State entity. The same applies to the SCA's conduct in the course of the
performance of the Contract.

It is true though that the Contract was awarded through a bidding process
governed by the laws on public procurement. This is not a sufficient element,
however, to establish that governmental authority was exercised in the SCA's
relation to the Claimants and more particularly in relation to the acts and omissions
complained of. What matters is not the "service public" element, but the use of
“prérogatives de puissance publique” or governmental authority. In this sense, the
refusal to grant an extension of time at the time of the tender does not show either

See for example the case of Rolimpex, in which although Rolimpex was under the strict control of the
State in a centralised economy, Lord Denning did not consider that its acts could be attributed to the
State: “I do not think that Rolimpex can be considered to be a department of the Government of
Poland ... Rolimpex is a State trading agency” (Court of appeals, 26 May 1977, /LR, 1983, vol. 64, p.
195, see also House of Lords, 6 July 1978, id., p. 204). Another case to the same effect is the one of
the Bank of Nigeria, where a distinction was made between the activities performed by the Bank as a
central monetary authority, and the act of buying cement for the construction of offices, which could
not be attributed to the State (England Court of Appeals, 13 January 1977, /LR, vol. 64, p. 122).

173.

that governmental authority was used, irrespective of the reasons for such refusal.
Any private contract partner could have acted in a similar manner.

On such basis, the Tribunal concludes that, although the SCA is a public entity
empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, the acts of the SCA vis
a vis the Claimants are not attributable to the Respondent in this arbitration on the
basis of Article 5 of the ILC Articles, as they were not performed pursuant to the
exercise of governmental authority.

c) Are the acts of SCA attributable to Egypt because the SCA has acted
upon the instruction of the State (Article 8 of the ILC Articles)?

Article 8 of the ILC Articles reads as follows:

ARTICLE 8
Conduct directed or controlled by a State

The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act
of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in
fact acting on the instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that
State in carrying out the conduct.

International jurisprudence is very demanding in order to attribute the act of a
person or entity to a State, as it requires both a general control of the State over
the person or entity and a specific control of the State over the act the attribution of
which is at stake; this is known as the “effective control” test.'7 There is no
evidence on record of any instructions that the State would have given to the SCA
in regard to the very specific acts and omissions of the SCA that are complained of
in this arbitration. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that there can be no
attribution of the acts of SCA to the Respondent under Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

Case concerning military and paramilitary activities in and against Nicaragua, (Nicaragua v. United
States of America), Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, /CJ Reports 1984, §§ 113 and 115.

“113. The question of the degree of control of the contras by the United States Government is
relevant to the claim of Nicaragua attributing responsibility to the United States for activities of the
contras whereby the United States has, it is alleged, violated an obligation of international law ... “.
115. The Court has taken the view ... that United States participation, even if preponderant or
decisive, in the financing, organizing, training, supplying and equipping of the contras, the selection of
its military or paramilitary targets, and the planning of the whole of its operation, is still insufficient in
itself, on the basis of the evidence in the possession of the Court, for the purpose of attributing to the
United States the acts committed by the contras in the course of their military or paramilitary
operations in Nicaragua. All the forms of United States participation mentioned above, and even the
general control by the respondent State over a force with a high degree of dependency on it, would
not in themselves mean, without further evidence, that the United States directed or enforced the
perpetration of the acts contrary to human rights and humanitarian law alleged by the applicant State.
Such acts could well be committed by members of the contras without the control of the United
States. For this conduct to give rise to legal responsibility of the United States, it would in principle
have to be proved that that State had effective control of the military or paramilitary operations in the
course of which the alleged violations were committed.” (Emphasis added).

d) Conclusions on attribution of the acts of the SCA

For the reasons just stated, the Tribunal concludes that the acts of the SCA vis a
vis the Claimants are not attributable to the Respondent. Therefore, the Tribunal
cannot review the conduct of the SCA in the conclusion and performance of the
Contract as such, since Egypt cannot be held liable for the SCA's actions and
omissions. This will not however prevent the Tribunal from reviewing elements of
the conclusion and performance of the Contract in the context of its analysis of the
decision of the Ismailia Court. Such review will, however, be exclusively performed
through the prism of the Ismailia Judgment.

Acts and omissions of the other actors

It is clear that the acts and omissions of the Prime Minister are attributable to
Egypt, the latter being an organ of the State pursuant to Article 4 of the ILC
Articles. There is no doubt either that the Administrative Court of Ismailia qualifies
as an organ of the State within the meaning of Article 4 of the ILC Articles, as
acknowledged by the Respondent's expert (Exh., R-6 6). Furthermore, one may
debate whether the Second Panel of Experts appointed by the Ministry of Justice to
issue a report within the judicial proceedings is a State organ or an entity
empowered to exercise governmental functions. A final conclusion would require
an in-depth inquiry into Egyptian law. Such an inquiry does not appear necessary
here. Indeed, the acts of the Second Panel of Experts are in any event attributable
to the State, whether they are considered as acts of an organ or as acts of a public
entity performing judicial functions vis a vis the Claimants. Lastly, it is not disputed
amongst the Parties that the conduct of the Committee for Settling the Complaints
of Foreign Investors is attributable to the Respondent.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT STANDARD
The Parties’ positions

4.1.1. The Claimants’ position

The Claimants argue that their legitimate expectations were violated “not only by a
breach of explicit promises made by the State, but also by its lack of transparency
and predictability in the conduct of negotiations leading to the conclusion of the
investment contract’ (1*' PHB, § 135) in order “to obtain an unacceptably low price

56

177.

178.

179.

at the expenses of the Claimants” (Tr. H., p. 77, English version). For them, Egypt's
behavior was “shocking and disgraceful’ (Tr. H, p. 80, English version).

The Claimants’ legitimate expectations were further violated by Egypt's failure to
redress the consequences of the initial breach (Tr. H., p. 83, English version).
Relying on CME v. The Czech Republic'®, the Claimants insist on the need for
remediation of previous undue interference (Tr. H., p. 84, English version).

The fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard was further violated by the
illegalities committed by the judiciary. In that respect, the behavior of Egypt is not to
be assessed under the standards of ordinary denial of justice, but rather “as part of
a broader violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment” and protection
of foreign investments (Reply, §] 256). The “failings of the Egyptian court could also
amount to a denial of justice per se, but this is not the object of the claim” (1*' PHB,
{ 124). The focus is not on the flaws of the judicial system. It is only an
“aggravating circumstance” of the previous illegality (Tr. H., p. 87, English version).
Indeed, the decision of the Ismailia Court is not to be evaluated in isolation but “as
the terminal point of a long series of illegalities’ (Reply, 254), since it “failed to set
right the wrongs committed by other organs of the State” (Reply, 256, also in 1*
PHB, 124).

Even if the standards of denial of justice were to apply, there would be a breach of
the BITs. Contrary to the Respondent's assertion, the Claimants had no obligation
to exhaust local remedies or else, “illegalities committed by lower courts could
[n]ever constitute a violation of international law’ (Reply, 4 259). Investors are
exempted from this requirement whenever the ICSID Convention applies, except if
so required by the State in conformity with Article 26 of the Convention (Reply,
74). This is so “because the rationale for requiring previous exhaustion as a
precondition to resort to and to exercise diplomatic protection has no basis when
the BIT does not subject recourse to international arbitration directly by the
aggrieved investor to such exhaustion” (Prof. Sacerdoti, Exh. C-176, § 79). In any
event, ‘[iJf the local remedies is [sic] inapplicable in the case of denial of justice, it is
all the more so where the behavior of the domestic courts is called into question
qua violation of the FET standard’ (1*' PHB, § 133).

1564.
57

180.

181.

182.

On that basis, “denial of justice can be realized by the unfair conduct and/or
manifest unjust judgment of a lower court. Such denial of justice is per se a form of
unfair treatment irrespective of the ability of the domestic system to redress it
through the quashing or reversal of the judgment of the lower court’ (Prof.
Sacerdoti, Exh., C-176 § 73). As a result, denial of justice can take the form of
“unjust decisions”, “clear and malicious misapplication of the law’ and “lack of
judicial propriety of the outcome” and occur “at the level of an individual case”
(Exh., C-116 76).

Quoting PSEG v. Turkey, the Claimants argue that the FET standard “does allow
for justice to be done in the absence of more traditional breaches of international
law standards”'® (1 *' PHB, 4 125). On that basis, “the FET sort of complements
the other rules, and sort of fills in gaps where the rigidity of the traditional rules may
not be sufficient to provide the level of protection implied” by the BIT (Tr. H, p. 89,
English version). Relying by analogy on the finding of Sempra v. Argentina on
expropriation, the Claimants submit that the FET standard “ensure[s] where there is
no clear justification for making a finding ... there is still a standard which serves
the purpose of justice and redress damage that is unlawful and that would
otherwise pass unattended’”° (1° PHB, 9126).

4.1.2 The Respondent’s position

As a main argument, the Respondent submits that the standards of denial of justice
ought to apply in the present case, and that the Tribunal is in any event entitled to
characterize “the object of the dispute” of its own motion (Rej., 251).

The Respondent denies any treaty violation since the decision of the Ismailia Court
cannot constitute a denial of justice - whether substantive or procedural?’ — on
essentially two grounds. First, the claim cannot be entertained, because the
decision is not final. Second, even if the Tribunal could entertain the claim, nothing
in the Judgment would warrant a finding of denial of justice. More specifically,

- The decision is not binding. It has been appealed and there is a 20% chance of
reversal on appeal (Rej., § 262).

PSEG v. Turkey, § 239 ff.
Sempra v. Argentina, J 300 ff.

“Le Jugement ne constitue pas et ne consacre pas un déni de justice, que ce soit en raison de sa
teneur (1) ou du délai dans lequel il a été rendu (2).” (CMem., § 250).

58

183.

- The Claimants have thus failed to exhaust local remedies as required under
international law (CMem., | 226). Such requirement was affirmed in Loewen v.
United States and reaffirmed in Saipem v. Bangladesh. The mere fact that the
appeal is pending is “fatal’ to the claim for denial of justice (CMem., § 253,
quoting Prof. Crawford’s Opinion 1, Exh., R-6). The fact that the State itself or
one of its organs is party to the domestic proceedings provides no exception to
the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies (Rej., 255).

- Indeed, ‘fiJt is fundamental to the definition of denial of justice that the system
of justice has failed, not only the individual court or judge” (CMem., { 228,
quoting Prof. Crawford’s Opinion 1, Exh. R-6).

- An incorrect or erroneous judgment is insufficient to constitute a denial of
justice. There needs to be “a manifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due
process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety”
(Prof. Crawford’s Opinion 1, Exh. R-6, {§ 4 and 27, quoting Loewen). The
burden is on the Claimants to establish that there was a clear and malicious
misapplication of the law.

- The content of the decision of the Ismailia Court is not “shocking” (CMem.,
257); and international tribunals are not meant to be courts of appeal for
domestic tribunals (2"? PHB, § 32).

More particularly, as far as procedural aspectsa are concerned, it is the
Respondent's view that the decision of the Ismailia Court does not involve a denial
of justice for the following reasons:

- There has been no bad faith nor intent to discriminate against the Claimants on
the part of the experts or the Egyptian judges;

- The Claimants were able to raise objections throughout the proceedings;

- There was no systematic bias against the Claimants, as arguments of the SCA
were also dismissed (CMem., { 260);

- The joinder of the two cases made common sense and was not dilatory
(CMem., § 261);

- The Ismailia Court made its own independent analysis and did not simply
follow the recommendations of the Second Panel (CMem., § 263);

59

4.2

184.

185.

186.

- Lastly, the duration of the proceedings was due to the complexity of the matter
and the need for two expert reports (CMem., § 268), as well as to the
Claimants’ “dissimulation frauduleuse” of their 1992 bathymetric studies and
their refusal to have the First Panel review the damages (CMem., { 269).

The Tribunal’s determination

The Tribunal will first examine the standards of fair and equitable treatment (4.2.1)
prior to reviewing each of the acts and conduct which have allegedly violated such
treatment (4.2.2 to 4.2.3).

4.2.1 Standards

Fair and equitable treatment is a flexible and somewhat vague concept”, which
must be appreciated in concreto taking into account the specific circumstances of
each case.” It is accepted today that a breach of fair and equitable treatment does
not presuppose bad faith on the part of the State.”*

Tribunals have considered that fair and equitable treatment was denied when the
protection of the investor's expectations had not been warranted, provided that
these were reasonable and legitimate. In the words of the tribunal in Tecmed, the
purpose of the fair and equitable treatment guarantee is “to provide to international
investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken
into account by the foreign investor to make the investment’®®. And in the terms of
the tribunal in Saluka:

By virtue of the ‘fair and equitable treatment’ standard, the host State
must [...] be regarded as having assumed an obligation to treat foreign

investors so as to avoid the frustration of investors' legitimate and
reasonable expectations. [...].”°

It is also common ground that the fair and equitable treatment may be violated
when procedural propriety and due process are denied. For example, the Waste
Management tribunal considered that fair and equitable treatment could be denied
“if the conduct is grossly unfair or idiosyncratic, discriminatory and exposes the
claimant to sectional or racial prejudice or involves lack of due process leading to
an outcome which offends judicial propriety - as might be the case with a manifest
failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency

and candour in an administrative process.”*”

The Tribunal recognizes that the 2002 and 1977 BITs do not comprise a specific
provision regarding the miscarriage or denial of justice. It considers, however, that
the fair and equitable treatment standard encompasses the notion of denial of
justice. The Parties and their experts are in agreement on that point.

This said, the Parties disagree on the applicable test. The Claimants favour a
flexible test which takes into account the factual situation in its entirety and focuses
on the outcome thereby giving greater weight to the FET standard and bypassing
the requirement for exhaustion of local remedies. By contrast, in reliance on the
limited jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the 2002 BIT, the Respondent considers
that the only conduct which can arguably form the basis for the claim is the
judgment of the Ismailia Court. It therefore only discusses the matter of denial of
justice.

Since the conduct of the SCA is not attributable to Egypt, the Tribunal is now faced
with two sets of acts: first, the acts and omissions in relation to the judicial
proceedings and, second, the acts and omissions involving the Prime Minister and
the Committee for Settling the Complaints of the Investors.

The first set of acts relates to the judicial proceedings which culminated in the
Ismailia Judgment. Even though the Claimants deny that the Judgment is "the

object" of their claim (1° PHB, 124), the delay in the proceedings, the conduct of
the Court and of the Second Panel all materialized with the issuance of the
Judgment. The Judgment lies at the core of this set of acts. Therefore, the Tribunal
is of the opinion that the relevant standards to trigger State responsibility for the
first set of acts are the standards of denial of justice, including the requirement of
exhaustion of local remedies as will be discussed below. Holding otherwise would
allow to circumvent the standards of denial of justice. The second set of acts will be
reviewed under the standards of the fair and equitable treatment described above.

The definition adopted by the Loewen tribunal pursuant to which denial of justice

implies “[mjanifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an

129

outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety’~ constitutes good guidance.

This is thus the standard that the Tribunal will apply to the acts in relation to the
judiciary.

Denial of justice may occur irrespective of any trace of discrimination or
maliciousness, if the judgment at stake shocks a sense of judicial propriety. A
reference to the test formulated by the Mondev tribunal is useful in this context:

In the ELSI case, a Chamber of the Court described as arbitrary conduct
that which displays “a wilful disregard of due process of law ... which
shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety”. It is true that
the question there was whether certain administrative conduct was
“arbitrary”, contrary to the provisions of an FCN treaty. Nonetheless (and
without otherwise commenting on the soundness of the decision itself)
the Tribunal regards the Chamber's criterion as useful also in the
context of denial of justice, and it has been applied in that context, as
the Claimant pointed out. The Tribunal would stress that the word
“surprises” does not occur in isolation. The test is not whether a
particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or surprise
occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified
concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome, bearing in mind on
the one hand that international tribunals are not courts of appeal, and on
the other hand that Chapter 11 of NAFTA (like other treaties for the
protection of investments) is intended to provide a real measure of
protection. In the end the question is whether, at an international level
and having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration
of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available
facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and
discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to
unfair and inequitable treatment. This is admittedly a somewhat open-
ended standard, but it may be that in practice no more precise formula
can be offered to cover the range of possibilities.”

Albeit rendered in the context of Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA and the minimum
standard of customary international law, the Tribunal finds this test appropriate.

4.2.2 Fair and equitable treatment and the proceedings leading to the
Decision of the Ismailia Court

The Claimants’ allegations with respect to the Ismailia proceedings can be viewed
as a procedural (a) or a substantive denial of justice (b). After examining these, the
Tribunal will deal with the issue of exhaustion of remedies (c). This latter
requirement applies to both substantive and procedural denial of justice, with the
exception of the claim of procedural denial of justice arising from delays in the
proceedings.

a) Procedural denial of justice

The Claimants’ allegations are threefold: they relate to due process before the
Ismailia Court (i), to the duration of the proceedings (ii), and to the conduct of the
Second Panel (iii).

(i) Due process

According to the Claimants, the “main illegalities’ concerning the domestic judicial
proceedings were as follows: “(i) the systematic disregard of all evidence and
findings favourable to the Claimants; (ii) the joining of the First and the Second
Case merely for dilatory purposes; (iii) the appointment of a new and non-
independent body of experts by the Ministry of Justice, as a pretext to overrule the
findings unfavorable to the State; and (iv) the passive espousal of the unreasoned
and ultra vires conclusions of a panel of technical experts with no legal
qualifications who overruled the fully reasoned findings of the two competent
bodies, the First Panel and the Commissaires” (Mem., { 317).

The first and fourth points raised by the Claimants relate to the decision of the
Ismailia Court and therefore to the notion of fraud discussed below. As it will be
explained, since no fraud was established, one cannot maintain that a judgment
denying a fraud constitutes a denial of justice.

Concerning the form of the Ismailia Judgment (Exh. C-158), the Tribunal notes that
the Judgment is fairly short (15 pages in the English translation) and hardly

qualifies as an “ideal” decision to close nearly ten years of proceedings. This said,
63

200.

201.

202.

it is not a mere espousal of the report of the Second Panel and cannot be said to
amount to a denial of justice on this ground.

In connection with the joinder of the First and Second Cases by the Ismailia Court,
there is no evidence on record that such joinder pursued dilatory purposes. The
Tribunal notes that even the Commissaire d’Etat on whom the Claimants rely
heavily suggested joining the two cases (Exh. C-118), notwithstanding the SCA’s
objections (Exh. C-119). Even though the cases were filed more than two years
apart, they related to the same Contract. Had the Contract been declared void for
mistake or fraud as requested by the Claimants in the First Case, this would have
had consequences on the Second Case. The Tribunal further notes that the joinder
was decided on 24 December 1998 and that the Claimants did not move to “re-
separate” the two cases until a year and a half later on 5 June 2000 (Exh. C-142).
By any standard, the joinder does not “offend a sense of judicial propriety’.

The Claimants also contest the appointment of the Second Panel on 29 May 2000
(Exh. C-141). The Court of Ismailia appointed the Second Panel upon the request
of one of the parties to the proceedings, namely the SCA. Although the
appointment was left to the Ministry of Justice, it does not appear to have been an
arbitrary decision, nor does it show a breach of due process. The Tribunal further
notes that the Claimants had opportunities to put forward their positions in writing
and orally. It also appears that as an alternative position the JV filed a submission
concluding that the First Panel had not completed its fifth mission in that it did not
assess the damages incurred by the JV. At the same time, the JV also requested
the split of the two cases. On that basis, the Court decided on 12 September 2000
to widen the Panel's mission to complete the fifth mission of the First Panel (i.e.,
assessing damages) (Exh. C-144). Considering these facts, the appointment of the
Second Panel cannot qualify as a lack of due process or denial of justice.

(ii) Duration of the proceedings

The Claimants complain of the excessive duration of the proceedings, which lasted
nearly ten years. The longer time period was spent at the stage of the First Panel.
Indeed, the First Panel was appointed on 6 September 1993, the Parties filed their
last submissions mid-1995, but the report was not issued before 6 February 1997,
upon the insistence of the Commissaire d’Etat.

64

203.

204.

205.

206.

207.

For the rest of the duration, the parties to the local proceedings exchanged
extensive submissions until the appointment of the Second Panel. That panel
issued its report in March 2002, and the hearing before the Court took place on 26
December 2002. The Court kept the case for deliberation in late December 2002
and rendered its decision on 22 May 2003. In the Tribunal's view, this string of
events cannot be deemed to constitute a denial of justice.

This said, there is no doubt that ten years to obtain a first instance judgment is a
long period of time. However, the Tribunal is mindful that the issues were complex
and highly technical, that two cases were involved, that the parties were especially
productive in terms of submissions and filed extensive expert reports. For these
reasons, it concludes that, while the duration of the proceedings leading to the
Ismailia Judgment is certainly unsatisfactory in terms of efficient administration of
justice, it does not rise to the level of a denial of justice.

(iii) The conduct of the Second Panel

For the Claimants, the Second Panel “exceeded its authority by investigating on the
fundamental and complicated legal issue of the liability of SCA” (SoC, p. 131). It
acted ultra vires.

As arule, in the context of a claim for denial of justice, the Tribunal does not review
the scope of the jurisdiction of the national authorities or the application of the law.
This may be different if the result were to show discrimination or severe
impropriety, a situation that does not arise here. Hence, the Tribunal can see no
element of denial of justice in this allegation.

b) Substantive denial of justice

(i) Applicable test

As explained above, the Claimants contend that the SCA committed a fraud which
the Ismailia Court failed to remedy. In order to determine whether the Ismailia
Judgment is “improper and discreditable” because it did not remedy the fraud, the
Tribunal needs to first establish whether there was a fraud. If the Tribunal finds a
fraud, it will then have to examine if the Ismailia Judgment was "improper" because
it did not redress it. To analyze whether there was a fraud, the Tribunal will look to

65

209.

the facts prior to the date on which the Judgment was rendered.*' As already
mentioned, these facts will only be analyzed through the prism of the claim for
denial of justice.

(ii) Assessment of allegations

. The Parties did not discuss the standards on which the alleged fraud must be

measured. They have argued their case on the basis of the facts. The Tribunal
understands, however, from the Egyptian rules on fraud® that intent is a necessary
element and that there is no fraud when the alleged victim could have known about
the relevant facts by another means®. For this reason, the Tribunal will proceed to
an assessment of the facts and review whether the SCA has intentionally withheld
material information leading the JV to enter into the Contract on wrong premises
and whether the JV had no other means of knowing the relevant facts.

The Tribunal is mindful that this is a high threshold for the Claimants to meet, but it
reflects the demanding nature of the concept of fraud and of a claim for denial of
justice. In this case, the Claimants have alleged in passing in their Reply, that there
“was a clear and malicious [mis]application of the law’ which was “discriminatory,
being obviously determined by the desire to prevent the success of a claim by a
foreign investor against the home State” (Reply, { 264). The Tribunal cannot follow

Or in the words of the Mondev tribunal: “Thus events or conduct prior to the entry into force of an
obligation for the respondent State may be relevant in determining whether the State has
subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to conduct of
the State after that date which is itself a breach. [...]" , op. cit., 4 70.

Article 125 of the Civil Code provides (Exh. C-84):

(1) A contract may be annulled for fraudulence, if the deceits to which one of the two contracting
parties, or which his deputy resorts are so tremendous that the second party would not have
concluded the contract if such tricks had not been there.

(2) Shall be considered as fraudulence a premeditated silence as to a fact or surrounding
circumstances, if it is evidenced the one who fell prey to such fraudulence would not have
concluded the contract if he has been aware of the said fact or the surrounding circumstances.

See Expert Opinion of Professor Hossam El-Ehwany who states: “16. [...] Le dol est une faute

volontaire et intentionnelle. L'intention de tromper est un élément nécessaire du dol. La simple

négligence ne constitue pas un dol méme lorsqu'elle provoque une erreur. L'imprévisibilité des
difficultés exclut la réticence et en méme temps intention dolosive.

17. Il faut de méme souligner le fait que les Demanderesses sont des professionnelles ayant de

l'expérience dans les travaux de dragage concernés par le contrat.

D'aprés AL-SANHOURY, rédacteur principal du code civil, la réticence au sujet d'un fait ou d'une

modalité ne constitue pas un dol quand la partie, prétendant 6tre victime du dol, aurait pu étre en

mesure de s'informer par un autre moyen que son cocontractant (Traité T. I, N. 181, p. 429, 3éme éd.,

1981, cour d'appel d'Assiout, 12 février 1940 Al-Mouhamma 22 N. 244 p. 698, Al-Sadda : Les sources

de I'obligatoire N. 169, p. 200, Le Caire, 1958, Morcos AL-WAFI dans Le Droit des Obligations T. 2,

Vol |, N. 207, p. 383, 4 eme éd. 1987). AL- SANHOURY précise, de méme, que celui qui est en

mesure de s'informer commet une faute en négligeant de s'informer.“ (Exh. R-12).

the Claimants in this line of arguments. There is no evidence on record of any
discrimination, bias or malicious application of the law based on a sectional
prejudice. In this instance, it is not the role of the Tribunal to review whether the
Ismailia Court conducted a correct contractual analysis or correctly applied
Egyptian law. Whether under Egyptian law the Court could (as argued by the
Respondent's expert, Prof. Hossam El-Ehwany, Exh. R-12) or on the contrary
could not (as alleged by the Claimants’ expert, Mr. Hosni Abdelwahed, Exh. C-178)
invoke the provisions of the Contract in its Judgment is not for this Tribunal to
decide. It is not the role of a tribunal constituted on the basis of a BIT to act as a
court of appeal for national courts.** The task of the Tribunal is rather to determine
whether the Judgment is "clearly improper and discreditable" in the words of the
Mondev tribunal.

(iii) Analysis

According to the Claimants, the fraud is constituted by the fact that the SCA
committed a "willful withholding of vital information" (Reply, § 106). More precisely,
the SCA allegedly (i) failed to disclose that it had engaged into pre-dredging
activities on the lot, (ii) failed to provide correct information to the bidders on
geology and volumes that the SCA obtained on the basis of the pre-dredging works
(including the Nedeco Report), providing instead obsolete information, and (iii)
failed to disclose that it had encountered rocks in pre-dredged areas.

The Tribunal has reviewed these allegations. Having thoroughly examined the
facts, the statements and reports on record and having heard the main protagonists
involved in the negotiation and performance of the Contract, the Tribunal is of the
opinion that the Claimants have not satisfactorily established the alleged fraud.
There are indeed elements to be held against both Parties to the Contract, as it will
now be explained.

* The volumes to be dredged
The Claimants’ position
Based on Plan 10432 (Exh. C-15(c)), the Claimants expected to dredge approx.

19.5 million m®. They also expected, based on the drawing attached to the bid form

Mondev, op. cit., § 127.
67

213.

which indicated “existing slope”, that the slope profiles would be regular and close
to 3/1, uniform and parallel. The indication “existing slope 3:1” on the Eastern slope
of the Canal which appears on the cross section signed by Mr. Salman dated
3 June 1992 “strengthened the Claimants’ understanding that the volume actually
to be dredged was 100% of the one indicated by SCA as set out in the bid forms”
(SoC, p. 20). The Claimants further dispute the relevance of the documents sent by
the SCA on 20 April 1992. They contend that the five cross sections sent on 20
April 1992 “were completely false and misleading’ because they pre-dated SCA’s
pre-dredging works (SoC, p. 16). Jacques Albert, former area manager for Jan de
Nul, contends that, in a meeting on 1 June 1992, the SCA instructed the bidders to
destroy and disregard these cross sections (Reply, § 180; WS J. Albert, Exh. C-
179, Tr. W., pp. 85, 123-124, 129, 172). In the Claimants’ words, “Mr. Salman
instructed the Claimants to provide for their fixed costs (i.e. mobilisation and
demobilisation) to be covered by a so-called "guaranteed" volume of 80%, and to
spread all the time-related costs over 100% of the volume. Such an instruction
implied that the cross sections attached to the April 21 fax (as well as any
information obtainable from the limited and unreliable surveys of April 1992) should
be disregarded and that the bidders were to consider valid only the original tender
information plus the information which would be provided by SCA on June 3 (see
Witness Statement by Mr. Jacques Albert, Exh. C-18)”. (Mem., § 35). For the
Claimants, the SCA gave this instruction because it knew that it had already
removed 5 million m® and that the “Claimants would never have been able to
recoup their time-related costs which, according to those instructions, were to be
covered by the lower unit rate spread over 100% of the volume” (SoC, p. 38).

The Claimants argue that none of the investigations they made prior to submitting
their offer showed the actual situation. The SIB boring campaign (Exh. C-20)
appeared to corroborate the 1975 Raymond campaign. In addition, due to adverse
weather conditions and time constraints, the resulting data from the GeoCom
Report were inaccurate and unreliable (WS Gidéon Hein, Exh. C-168 and C-171).
Most importantly, the Claimants argue that the SCA failed to provide a sufficient
number of reference Easting and Northing co-ordinates to properly carry out the
surveys (Mem., § 24). At the most, the GeoCom survey was an unsuccessful
attempt at a bathymetric survey and only resulted in a seismic survey (WS G. Hein,
Exh. C-168, 4 11-13). In any event, the volumes to be dredged could not be
calculated on the basis of the GeoCom survey because that survey lacked the
theoretical profiles of the slopes (WS G. Hein, Exh. C-171), out of which the

68

214.

215.

216.

217.

218.

Tribunal understands cross sections are derived. In addition, the irregularity of the
slopes could not be detected using the bathymetric chart of the GeoCom’s survey,
and were not expected from the profiles delivered by the SCA.

Ultimately, the results of the 1993 joint bathymetric survey (Exh. C-37) showed that
the slope profile was irregular and that the volume to be dredged in the widening
was substantially less - by 5 million m® - than expected. Accordingly, the widening
was less than 45 meters and the deepening less than 4.5 meters in some parts of
the Canal, resulting in a lower production rate and therefore higher cost per m®
dredged. For the Claimants, only 18% of the contracted area corresponded to the
SCA’s representations (Mem., { 57).

Had the SCA disclosed that the company Penta Ocean had over-dredged certain
areas from km 157,5 to km 161,5 in 1977-1980, i.e., during the first phase of the
works on the Canal, and that the SCA itself had pre-dredged the lot awarded to the
Claimants between 1989 and 1991, the Claimants would have quoted higher unit
prices per cubic meter. The drawing showing pre-dredging works (Exh. C-45) was
only delivered to Pierre Tison, works manager for the JV, during a meeting in
January 1993.

The Respondent's position

The Respondent contends that there was no guarantee of 100% volume. Lot (1’)
covered 17,600,000 m® with 80% of volume guaranteed. The Claimants actually
dredged 14,564,706 m%, i.e., 82.75% of the total estimated quantities (CMem., 4
26).

Mr. Salman, the head of SCA’s Engineering Department, denied having given any
instruction to disregard the cross sections sent on 20 April 1992 (WS, Exh. R-4,
4/20). He also denied giving oral assurances that there was a 100% guaranteed
volume (CMem., § 43; WS Salman, Exh. R-4). The Respondent also points out that
the Claimants never referred to Mr. Salman’s alleged oral instructions before it first
appeared in the 1994 Patzold Report filed in the course of the local proceedings
(Exh. C-95).

Mr. Salman further testified that the SCA did not provide Exhibit C-45 (pre-dredging

drawings) to the bidders at the time of the tender as it was not the SCA’s practice

(Tr. W., pp. 92-94) to share internal documents that were not up to date (Exh. R-4,
69

219.

220.

221.

{ 3). In addition, the profiles and side slopes continually changed due to the erosion
and sedimentation in the coral (Exh. R-4, § 18).

According to the Respondent, the Claimants should have been aware of the lesser
volume on the basis of the documents available to them although the SCA did not
expressly mention pre-dredging works. Specifically, Egypt refers to the following
documents:

- Three of the cross sections sent on 20 April 1992 for kms 150, 153 and 157
showed that non-systematic pre-dredging operations had been carried out
and completed on 3 March 1991 (CMem., § 30 and { 77; Rej., 4 27).

- The 1988 borehole documents submitted on 31 March 1992 (Exh. C15(d))
showed that the water level was deeper than what appeared in drawing
10431, i.e., that widening works had been performed (Rej., § 34; ER Taillé,
Exh. R-5, p. 55).

- The first tender form which the Claimants used in their offer of 2 May 1992
(Exh. C-21) specified “Lot (1-1) between Km 151,500 [instead of 150,000]
and Km 162,500", meaning that the Canal had already been widened by at
least 20 meters which implied a missing volume of 450,000 m* (CMem.,
37-39).

- The GeoCom survey contained an accurate bathymetric survey, on the basis
of which the SCA had drawn up 46 drawings of profiles (Exh. R-3) that
showed an irregularity in the slopes and the volume of material to be
dredged (WS Salman, Exh. R-4, 12).

According to the Respondent, the Claimants were actually aware of the lower
volume and took it into account in the price quoted in their second offer for which
they quoted for 80% of the volume of Lot 1.

The Tribunal’s determination on the volumes to be dredged

It is obvious on the basis of the record that the SCA did not disclose the existence

of pre-dredging works before the tender. It only provided Exhibit C-45 dated 13

March 1991 (which indicated that pre-dredging works had been done between km

150,200 and 157,000 in 1989 and 1991) after the Contract had been awarded in

1993. The reasons put forward by Mr. Salman for not releasing this plan, namely

the changing nature of the slopes, are unconvincing. It has been established during
70

222.

223.

224.

the hearing that sedimentation and erosion were not at issue in the Southern part
of the Canal (P. Tison, Tr. W., p. 221, lines 1-2). The Nedeco Report stated that no
siltation occurs south of km 127 (J. Albert, Tr. W., p. 75, line 13). The First Panel
also stated that there is “neither erosion nor sedimentation” in that part of the canal
(Report of the First Panel, p. 29, 4 5.3, Exh. C-116). In other words, the reason of
the changing nature of the slopes due to erosion and sedimentation does not pass
muster. The SCA did not provide all the information it had. Was it obliged to do so?
The Tribunal would be inclined to think so. This said, the Tribunal must also
examine whether the Claimants were nevertheless in a position to know of the pre-
dredging works.

As a preliminary consideration, the Tribunal asked itself why the Claimants would
have entered into the Contract had they known about the volume shortage, as the
Respondent argues. As a result of poor business judgment, did the Claimants
understand, as the Respondent claims, that only 80% was guaranteed but did
intend to spread 100% of the mobilization and demobilization costs over the
guaranteed volumes (R. 1° PHB, {| 89 and § 91)? These questions remain open.

The Tribunal also notes that the volumes to be dredged raised concerns for all the
bidders as of the first tender. As explained by Mr. Salman (Exh. R-4), the bidders
expected to find less than 100% of the estimated volumes and hence presented
higher prices leading the SCA to announce a second tender. The JV explained in
its second offer (Exh. C-28) that the first offer assumed considerably lower volumes
based on the information supplied by the SCA, including the Canal profiles (Exh. C-
28). Since the SCA guaranteed that the volumes would not be less than 80% of the
stated quantity, the JV explained that it had lessened its prices (Exh. C-28).

This said, the Tribunal finds the Parties’ respective positions as to the expected
volume to be dredged unpersuasive. The SCA had planned 14.6 million m? with a
tolerance of more or less 20%, thus amounting to 17.6 million m® at the upper limit.
According to the Respondent, this long established internal practice allowed the
SCA to pay over-dredging in a proportion of 20% without waiting for the necessary
budgetary authorizations (R. 1° PHB, {| 72). Be this as it may, the Tribunal is ready
to concur with the Claimants that the offer was so drafted because the SCA knew
that the actual volume would be less than 80% of the theoretical quantities because
of prior dredging. By contrast, the Claimants put forward an initial theoretical
volume of 19.5 million m® (i.e., a net volume of 18,125,690 m® plus a tolerance

71

225.

226.

227.

228.

volume of 1,430,758 m® in case of over-dredging). This does not appear to
correspond to the terms of the Contract.

The Tribunal must now assess whether the JV had the means of knowing that the
final volume would be less than it expected prior to making its offer.

The Tribunal is aware that the Claimants are recognized professionals in their field
and that the success of a project such as the one at stake is contingent upon
various elements, amongst which preparation is crucial. The Claimants do not
dispute that fact but submit that the “extent of the bidder's duty of investigation
depends on the duration of tender period as well as on the nature and
exhaustiveness of the information provided by the employer’ (SoC., p. 16). The
facts of this case lead the Tribunal to question whether the JV sufficiently
investigated the project. It is true that the time period between the first tender and
the first submission was short, and that the SCA refused a time extension.
However, the Claimants had actually from March 1992 to June 1992 to prepare
themselves. In addition, the characteristics of lot (1') show that it was only a
variation of lot (1) which was the first lot to be tendered. The main difference
resided in shorter widening (only 45 meters instead of 70) with the same deepening
(- 4, 5 meters). In addition, although it is a remeasurement contract and not a lump
sum contract, Article 5 of the GCC especially provided that “each tenderer must
under his full responsibility, take all necessary steps and make all required
investigations to be able to estimate exactly the nature and extent of his
obligations”. Thus, the Claimants were aware of the importance of the preparation
period.

To conduct its analysis, the Tribunal must now look at the documents that the JV
had in its possession. The Parties have discussed at length the relevance of the
GeoCom Report. Two issues arise in connection with such Report: (/) whether it
included a bathymetric survey and (ii) what its results showed or could have
showed.

The first question arises because when asked by the First Panel whether they had
performed a bathymetric survey, the Claimants answered in the negative and
explained that there was no need for such survey in this type of contract. They also
stated that they only conducted a limited soil investigation campaign (Exh. C-109,
Question No. 3). They added that a bathymetric survey was not necessary as the

72

229.

230.

tender documents and the additional information provided by the SCA further to the
meeting of 14 April 1992 “could be relied upon” (Exh. C-109, Question No. 3).
Further, if such a survey had been performed by Boskalis, it was “on their own
initiative and independently from the JV” (Exh. C-116, Report of the First Panel, p.
26; Exh. C-109, Answer of the JV, Question No. 4). The JV reiterated its statement
before the Commissaire d’Etat (Exh. C-117), who concluded that no bathymetric
survey had been made, and again before the Second Panel (Exh. C-146). Mr.
Albert testified that the decision not to disclose the GeoCom Report to the First
Panel was made by the Claimants at the time (Tr. W., p. 121, lines 1-2). This lead
the First Panel to conclude that it was not in a position to confirm whether or not the
JV had made a bathymetric survey (Exh. C-116, p. 66).

It is clear that the JV intended to perform a seismic and bathymetric survey as
evidenced by the wording of the GeoCom Report (Exh. C-168, p. 1). It has also
been established in this arbitration that investigations were carried out to that
effect. However, the JV and the SIB decided to disregard the results in a meeting of
27 April 1992 (Tr. W., J. Albert, p. 81, lines 7-11 and p. 194, line 10). The reason
put forward by the Claimants is that they lacked coordinates (not provided by the
SCA) and that time was short. Nonetheless, cross lines were drawn up but
disregarded. Having heard the experts of both Parties, the Tribunal believes that a
bathymetric survey was carried out, albeit possibly in an incomplete manner. It
cannot help finding it disturbing that the JV decided not to disclose to the First
Panel, as well as to the Commissaire d’Etat and the Second Panel, that it had
conducted a bathymetric survey but had later disregarded it.

Turning now to the inferences that the JV could have drawn from the GeoCom
Report had it been used, the situation is at best unclear. Mr. Bray, expert for the
Claimants, acknowledged that a comparison of the cross lines with the theoretical
profiles would have likely “alerted [the JV] to the facts that in some locations there
was a major discrepancy’ (Exh. C-182, § 8.5). Bearing this in mind, it appears
difficult to find that the GeoCom Report was useless, as alleged by the Claimants.
For the Tribunal, there is no doubt that the JV acted lightly in disregarding the
results of the GeoCom Report and that the Claimants have not established that
based on its own investigations the JV did not or could not have any knowledge of
the prior dredging.

73

231.

232.

233.

234.

The next question the Tribunal needs to address is whether the information in the
tender documents provided by the SCA was deficient. Did these documents, and
more particularly the cross sections provided by the SCA on 20 April 1992, as well
as the drawings attached to the second and third tender show any prior pre-
dredging? First, the Tribunal notes that it has not been established that Mr. Salman
instructed the bidders, and more particularly the JV, to disregard the cross sections
sent on 20 April 1992.

In their last post-hearing brief, the Claimants argued that the other bidders did not
infer any results from the GeoCom Report either and that they all disregarded the
April 1992 cross sections. That argument remains unsupported. The prices quoted
by the bidders may all have decreased but it has not been established that it was
because the bidders all had the same understanding of the tender. Indeed, such
decrease in price could have been related to commercial issues such as the joint
award of two lots. Any other conclusion would be mere speculation on the part of
the Tribunal.

During the hearing, the discussion focused on the indication “existing slope” made
on the very basic sketches attached to the second and third tenders (Exh. C-27
and C-32), and on whether this indication referred to the actual existing slope as
contended by the JV or to the theoretical existing slopes as put forward by
Mr. Salman (Tr. W., p. 140). Mr. Albert, witness for the Claimants, testified that the
JV only had to start dredging an additional 45 meters from the existing slope (Tr.
W., p. 134, line 23).

The Tribunal is not convinced that, at the stage of the second tender, Mr. Salman
instructed the JV to take only into account the existing line, nor that the mention
“existing line 3:1” in the third tender on Exhibit C-32 was an instruction to disregard
the theoretical line. Indeed, the text of the third tender refers expressly to a
widening of 45 meters “measured between theoretical slopes” (Exh. C-32). This
said, the Tribunal understands that the concept of theoretical slopes of the Canal is
somehow virtual since the SCA did not possess the actual cross sections of the
t8>

Canal, as admitted by the Respondent*. Nevertheless, Mr. Bray, expert for the

Claimants, found a volume of 17.713 million m® on the basis of the drawing of

« La SCA ne disposant pas de coupes du Canal tous les 25 métres, ni méme tous les 250 metres, ne
pouvait en effet faire autrement que de présenter un schéma théorique global pour toute la
longueur du Lot 1’, le profil réel du Canal étant quant a lui trés variable comme le montraient les
coupes du 20 avril 1992 » (R. 1S‘ PHB, 59, emphasis in the original).

74

237.

22 June 1992 (Exh. C-32; Exh. C-182, 9 6.4-6.5), meaning that the drawing could
be used. Be this as it may, the Tribunal believes that while the SCA was not
sufficiently transparent, the JV could have obtained further clarification prior to
entering into the Contract.

. Coming now to certain drawings and other documents provided to the JV, the

Tribunal is ready to concur with the Respondent that Exh. C-14(d) and 15 (c)
(drilling holes made in 1986-1987 and plan 10431) could have shown that prior
dredging had occurred since it showed a discrepancy between the theoretical and
the actual depths (R. 1‘ PHB, § 69-70). This said, the Tribunal understands that
some other drawings (Plans 10431 and 10402 — Exh. 15 (a) and (b)) even if dated
February 1992 were made on the basis of the 1975 Raymond campaign (Tr. W.,
p. 74). In these circumstances, they could not reflect the actual underwater
conditions at the time of the tender.

. The Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent's assertion that the JV should

have known the actual volume because lot 1-1 started at km 151,500, instead of
km 150,000. The contractual documents (e.g., Art. 2 of the Specifications, Art. 13 of
the Contract (provisional reception), Annex 1 attached to the Contract (list of
quantities and prices)) all refer to km 150. There are thus no elements on record
showing that the JV should have known the actual volume from this limited
indication.

Overall and notwithstanding the silence of the SCA during the tender process
regarding pre-dredging works, the Tribunal concludes that it has not been
satisfactorily established that the SCA led “the bidders to believe that it existed an
additional 5 million m*’ as argued by the Claimants (1% PHB, 10), nor that the JV
had no means to actually know that the volume would be less than expected by
them.

* Proportion of rock

The Claimants’ position

. The Claimants contend that it appeared from Exh. C-14(b) (Plan No 10433) and

from the SIB’s results of April 1992, that the quantity of hard material was 3% of the
entire volume to be dredged (Mem., § 19). Dredging NV had a positive previous
experience on lot K carried out in 1977-1980 and considered the information given

75

239.

240.

241.

242.

by the SCA to be true (Reply, § 14). Mr. Hein also mentioned that the GeoCom
seismic survey could not reveal a significant presence of rocks because the survey
was not reliable failing to have lateral positioning. Dr. Patzold, expert for the
Claimants, confirmed that the survey was useless for any production and unit price
estimates (Exh. C-182, p. 21).

When the Claimants began dredging, they encountered patches of very hard
sandstone in unforeseen areas. From October 1992 to December 1992, the
Claimants wrote to the SCA (Exh. C-39, C-40), which answered that first it had
submitted all the available information (Exh. C-40), that such information were only
indications, and second that the contractor had to carry out all the necessary
borings under Article 5 of the Specifications in order to evaluate the situation. (Exh.
C-43/C-44).

According to the Claimants, they encountered hard soils resulting in a reduction of
productivity (the dredging process being slower) and damage to equipment. The
Claimants then deemed it necessary to carry out a borehole drilling campaign and
obtained the oral consent of the SCA on 19 January 1993 (SoC, p. 41).

In February/March 1993, the Claimants instructed MISR Raymond Foundation to
carry out their own borehole drilling campaign. Raymond submitted a report in
March 1993 (Exh. C-61 and C-62) allegedly confirming the presence of large
volume of rocks instead of the expected soft material. An additional campaign was
carried out in June/July 1993 to locate and identify the quantities of rock. The
Claimants contracted Foundation Engineering of Dubai (Costain) which submitted a
report in September 1993 (Exh. C-75). The University of Ghent was also instructed
to carry out tests on soil samples found in the above mentioned surveys to
ascertain the characteristics of the soil (Exh. C-76). It allegedly emerged from the
campaigns that hard material (rock and hard strata) amounted to 43% of the entire
volume to be dredged. Results of the surveys were sent to the SCA on 4 April 1993
(Exh. C-63).

The Claimants argue that the SCA was aware that at least 40% of the soil was
composed of hard materials, but provided the bidders with misleading information
indicating only 3% of sandstone and a minor portion of cemented sand (Patzold, C-
182, p. 19). For the Claimants, the SCA knew the soil condition because of the
Nedeco Report (disclosed by the SCA during the local court proceedings in

76

January 1994 upon the First Panel’s request, Exh. C-97), which showed that there
was at least 29.5% of hard to dredge materials, namely cemented sand (16.5%)
and rock (12.5%) (1*' PHB, | 74; Exh. C-196 — Dr. Patzold’s documentation at the
hearing). However, Nedeco itself was misinformed by the SCA as to the exact
degree of cementation of the sand (Reply, § 157). Indeed, Dr. Patzold’s calculation
gave a proportion of 53,4% of rock based on the actual 1993 boreholes. The SCA
was also aware of the rock since it had encountered hard strata in its pre-dredging
work but moved on each time to seek soft soil (SoC, p. 3).

The Respondent's position

243. On the expected nature of the soil, Egypt puts forward the following contentions:

e No tender documents, including Plan 10433, ever referred to 3% of hard
rock. There was no guarantee in this respect on the part of the SCA, nor was
it mentioned in the Claimants’ offers. The figure of 3% came up for the first
time on 11 May 1993 when the JV submitted documents in support of its
request for additional costs (Exh. C-72) (CMem., {{ 97-103).

e The information provided in the tender documents (Exh. C-14) was not
incorrect, even though the SCA could not guarantee that it was fully
accurate. As usual in dredging contracts (Exh. R-10), the Respondent's
liability in this respect was waived in Article 5 of the CCG (Exh. C-6)
(CMem., 104-110).

«It was not reasonable to forecast a 3% rate:

- The GeoCom seismic studies showed soil strata (“sandstone”) that
were hard to be dredged (Exh. R-1, §[ 2).

- Article 9 of the Specifications required cutter section dredgers of not
less than 200 HP on the cutter, demonstrating that powerful cutters
were needed because of the nature of the soil (ER Taillé, Exh. R-5, p.
8).

- Article 12 of the GCC specifically provided that the existence of rocky
strata does not entitle the contractor to an increase in the price or an
extension of time. It is common ground in the industry that unforeseen
conditions are borne by the contractor.

77

- In addition, Dredging NV knew the nature of the soil since it had
dredged part of the Canal in 1977-1980 (Exh. C-190, dredging report of
lot K). At that time, it already encountered 25% of cemented sand
(CMem., § 146).

The Respondent further challenges the Claimants’ alleged percentage on
the following grounds:

- The SCA made some calculation during the First Panel’s expertise and
found 41.35% of hard rock and hard material. However, it only found
8.78% of hard rock per se (class 4 C/4D) and for the rest cemented clay
and sand (class 4A/4B) (Exh. C-99).

- Before the First Panel, Dr. Patzold only found 2% of soil class 4C/D
(Exh. C-108, annex 4).

- The Claimants have submitted inconsistent figures: 45.67% of hard
rock before the First Panel and now 43%, both figures being
unverifiable (CMem., {J 149-153).

244. On SCA’s disclosure of documents, the Respondent makes the following

assertions:

The SCA had no obligation to provide the Nedeco Report or the dredging
pre-plan (Exh. C-45) since the bidders had the possibility — and the
obligation — of conducting the required bathymetric surveys out themselves
(CMem., { 39).

The Nedeco Report was a feasibility study. The SCA chose not to give this
data to the bidders so as not to “restrict their freedom to carry out their own
studies in line with their technical capabilities” (Answers to the First Panel,
Exh. C-110).

The Nedeco Report included cost information that was lower than the
Contract prices. Even if the Claimants would have had the Nedeco Report,
they would have in any event quoted a similar price. The Claimants’ expert,
Dr. Patzold, confirmed on 10 November 1994 that the Claimants reached
results that were similar to that of the Nedeco Report (CMem., {J 16-18).

78

245.

246.

247.

¢ More importantly, the Claimants had been provided with the same underlying
information as contained in the Nedeco Report (CMem., 9 112-119), a fact
that the Claimants deny (Reply, 154; Mem, § 79).

« The SCA did not know about the nature of the soil. It did not reach that area
when it carried out pre-dredging works. Even when it did occasionally, the
pre-dredging encountered silty clay, not hard rock, and not in large areas
(CMem., 9 121-128).

The Tribunal’s determination on the proportion of rock

It is true that the JV requested a month extension to carry out “a supplementary soil
investigation” (Exh. C-16) that was refused by the SCA. It is also clear that prior
dredging led to an increase in the percentage of rock as acknowledged by the First
Panel (Exh. C-116, § 3.2) and by Messrs. Brossard and Taillé, experts for the
Respondent (Exh R-5, p. 45). This said, the question here is whether the SCA
knew about the rock proportion and whether the JV could have known.

The Tribunal is aware that the Nedeco Report had not been submitted to the
bidders and that, even in the words of the Respondent's expert, Mr. Taillé, “it was
of such a nature that it should have been communicated to the various tenderers”
(Tr. W., p. 207, lines 14-17). This said, it has not been established that Nedeco
received more or other information than the JV when it examined the dredging
costs. Annex G, § 2.4.1 (borelogs) of the Nedeco Report listed the information
received by Nedeco (1975 Raymond borelogs and the 1986/1987 SCA borelogs)
which appear to be materially the same as the one received by the JV.

The Claimants’ arguments based on the retention of the Nedeco Report by the
SCA have not persuaded the Tribunal. First, the Claimants’ expert Dr. Patzold
himself considered that the JV reached similar results as the Nedeco Report.
Indeed, according to Dr. Patzold, Nedeco and the JV reached similar results in
terms of rock proportion on the basis of the 1975 Raymond campaign by “a
remarkable coincidence” (Tr. W., pp. 23, 19-20, 30, 40, 55) (such results related to
an alleged 2% of core volume for Nedeco and 3% for the JV). They thus also
reached similar weekly costs and unit rates for large cutters. The coincidence was
termed remarkable because the JV reached such results without having the
Nedeco Report (Tr. W., p. 60, line 23). If the JV had reached similar results as
those set in the Nedeco Report, how could it have suffered from not having the

79

248.

249.

250.

251.

report? The argument according to which even Nedeco was not given the correct
figures appears farfetched to say the least.

The Tribunal needs not enter into technical discussions as to what constitutes rock
and what was the actual proportion finally present. Suffice it to note that the experts
could not agree, and that no consistent figures have been adduced since 1993 (not
even as to the percentage stated in the Nedeco Report). Irrespective of the final
rock proportion, it is clear, however, that such a high proportion of rock was
unforeseen. It is clear from the documents on record that the Southern part of the
Canal was rockier than the rest. The Claimants themselves offered to use the
biggest of the very large cutters in the world, the Marco Polo and the Amazone. Dr.
Patzold on the basis of the 1992 in-survey, made by the JV and the SCA before the
1993 thorough boreholes, found at first 3.7% of rock (Exh. C-181). That shows that
the final proportion of rock was unforeseen. Equally, it has not been proven that the
SCA knew that a high proportion of rock would be found. Indeed, it has not been
established that the SCA reached the rock layer when it performed previous
dredging works from km 157.300 to 159,000 (R. 2" PHB, q 34; Exh. C-116, p. 38),
nor that it stopped dredging in that section because it knew that rock existed. It has
not been argued nor established that the SCA had in its possession records of
other boreholes or other documents that would have shown the actual proportion of
rock (except for the Nedeco Report, which was discussed above).

Conversely, it has not been established that the JV’s expected low rate was
reasonable, nor that on the basis of the SIB results the Claimants were not in a
position to ascertain a higher proportion of rock (as argued by Messrs. Brossard
and Taillé, Exh. R-10, p. 12; Exh R-5, p. 29).

The Tribunal realizes that 75% of the Claimants’ monetary claim relates to
unexpected soil conditions (C. 1 PHB, 112). However, it being satisfied that the
SCA had no prior knowledge of the proportion of rock and that the contractual
documents did not contain any warranty as to the rock proportion, the Tribunal
concludes that the alleged fraud has not been established.

* Imbalance between deepening and widening operations

When convoys were to pass in the Canal, the Claimants were supposed to be able

to stop deepening (which allegedly represented 36% of the works) and engage in

widening operations (allegedly representing 64% of the works - 50% of which was
80

252.

253.

254.

255.

allegedly missing). Because of the shortfall in the volumes from the widening and
SCA’s poor management of the traffic in the Canal, the Claimants allege that they
were unable to proceed as planned and thus incurred idle time and negative
productivity.

For the Respondent, the ratio 36/64 relied upon by the Claimants was not
mentioned during the tender, and the SCA never gave a guarantee of width of
widening of 36%, nor of a width of 45 meters (CMem., § 87). Further, the
Respondent alleges that the impact of the ratio on the costs incurred has not been
established.

According to the Tribunal, the issue of the deepening-widening ratio is directly
linked to the regularity of the slopes and even more to the question of time needed
to perform the dredging, which also arose in the preceding discussion. In addition,
the Tribunal notes that the SCA made no representation in that respect and would
regard the discussion about the ratio to be part of the commercial assessments
made by the JV.

* Conclusion

It follows that the evidence before the Tribunal does not establish that the SCA
committed a fraud. Hence, there can be no issue of substantive denial of justice
based on the ground that the Ismailia Court failed to remedy a fraud that did not
exist.

c) Exhaustion of local remedies

The analysis of the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies supports the
foregoing conclusions that the local judicial proceedings did not give rise to a denial
of justice. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes before pursuing that the
requirement at issue here relates to the merits of the denial of justice claim®. It
must be distinguished from the requirement addressed in Article 26 of the ICSID
Convention which deals with the admissibility of the claims brought before an
ICSID Tribunal.

See e.g. Saipem v. Bangladesh (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07), Decision on Jurisdiction and
Recommendation on Provisional Measures, 21 Mars 2007, { 151. See also Christopher Greenwood,
“State Responsibility for the Decisions of National Courts” in Issues of State Responsibility before
International Judicial Institutions, edited by M. Fitzmaurice and D. Sarooshi, The Clifford Chance
Lectures, Vol. 7, (2004) Hart Publishing, pp. 55-73.

81

256.

257.

258.

259.

260.

The Tribunal also notes at this juncture that the requirements of exhaustion of local
remedies would not have been a bar to a claim of denial of justice on the basis of
excessive delays in the judicial proceedings had such delays been deemed a treaty
breach. Indeed, it would make no sense to insist on the exhaustion of remedies
that are unavailable precisely because the issuance of an appealable decision is
delayed. Such insistence might constitute a denial of justice in and of itself.

The Parties have conflicting views with respect to the issue of exhaustion of
remedies. In substance, for the Claimants it is not a necessary requirement, while
the Respondent assesses the contrary.

The Tribunal considers that the respondent State must be put in a position to

redress the wrongdoings of its judiciary.*” In other words, it cannot be held liable

unless “the system as a whole has been tested and the initial delict remained

uncorrected’.** An exception to this rule may be made when there is no effective
«39

remedy or “no reasonable prospect of success*,~’ which was not argued by the
Claimants.

The Tribunal cannot concur with the Claimants’ expert that an unjust judgment of a
lower court may per se constitute unfair and inequitable treatment and, therefore,
denial of justice without any prior conditions being met. Equally, the fact that an
appeal is pending is not irrelevant.

In this case, the Claimants have lodged an appeal against the Judgment of the
Ismailia Court on 20 July 2003 (Exh. C-8). According to the Claimants’ legal expert,
Prof. Hosni Abdelwahed, the SCA has also lodged an appeal (Exh. C-178, 4 40).
Be this as it may, the Judgment is in any event under appeal. Thus, the Claimants
do not complain of the failure of the Egyptian legal system as such, but merely of
the conduct of the Ismailia Court and its appointed experts. This is not sufficient to

Or in the words of the Loewen tribunal: “The purpose of the requirement that a decision of a lower
court be challenged through the judicial process before the State is responsible for a breach of
international law constituted by judicial decision is to afford the State the opportunity of redressing
through its legal system the inchoate breach of international law occasioned by the lower court
decision. The requirement has application to breaches of [NAFTA] Articles 1102 and 1110 as well as
Article 1105." (§ 156).

Jan Paulsson, Denial of Justice in International Law, (2005) Cambridge, p. 125.

Loc. cit., p. 130. Or in the words of Prof. Greenwood, “Secondly, the decision of a national court,
however badly flawed, will not amount to a denial of justice engaging the international responsibility of
the State unless the system of appeals and other challenges which exists in that State either does not
correct the deficiencies of the lower court's decision or is such that it does not afford a prospect of
correcting those deficiencies which is reasonably available to the alien who has suffered from that
decision. ”, op. cit., p. 68.

justify a claim for denial of justice, let it be through the fair and equitable claim, at
least when there is no claim that the appellate proceedings are in any manner
dysfunctional.

Faced with this situation, the Tribunal has asked itself whether, in the exercise of its
residual procedural powers under Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, there would
be ground to stay the arbitration until the appeal is finally determined and then rule
on the claim taking into account the outcome of the appeal. It has concluded in the
negative, because the Parties have not requested a stay and because a stay would
run counter the interests of justice and the interests of the Parties. Indeed, the
Request for Arbitration was filed late 2003, the Parties have now fully argued their
case before this Tribunal and the dispute is ready to be decided. Moreover, the
Tribunal has no information about the status and the timing of the appeal. Under
these circumstances, it appears in the best interest of the Parties and in conformity
with good administration of justice that clarity be created at this stage.

4.2.3, Fair and equitable treatment in relation to the Prime Minister and the
Committee for Settling the Complaints of the Investors

a) The Prime Minister’s conduct

The Claimants question the conduct of the Prime Minister in his role of authority
responsible for the acts of the SCA. According to the Claimants, the Prime Minister
was informed of the situation and failed to find a solution or to address the
Claimants’ claims (SoC, p. 126). For the Claimants,

As recognized by the arbitral tribunal in CME, [t]his non-response and
inaction by the [organ of the host State] aggravated the deterioration of
the [investor's] legal basis for its investment in the [host State] by
reiterating and further supporting [the interference with the investment].
(SoC, p. 128)

The facts and the evidence on record provide no ground to conclude that there was
a violation of the duty to provide fair and equitable treatment. In particular, it was
not established that the Claimants had any expectations with regard to the actions
of the Prime Minister, nor that any representations were made to that effect.

83

264.

265.

266.

267.

b) The conduct of the Committee for Settling the Complaints of the
Investors

According to the Claimants, the Committee failed to render a decision (SoC, p.
137), while it has an obligation to do so under its constituting (1996) decree (Exh.
C-127). As a result, the Claimants’ legitimate expectations were allegedly
frustrated.

The Tribunal has found nothing in the record that seems to imply that the
Committee had an obligation to issue a decision. Neither did it find that the
investors were diligent in pursuing this remedy. They left the proceedings inactive
without moving to activate them, for instance by complaining about the inaction and
requesting that a decision be issued. In addition, the legitimate expectations that
are protected are the ones at the time of the making of the investment and the
Committee was only set up in 1996. For this reason, the Tribunal finds no breach of
the fair and equitable standard in relation with the Committee for Settling the
Complaints of the Investors.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE CONTINUOUS PROTECTION AND SECURITY STANDARDS

According to the Claimants, the failure of a State to prevent damages and restore a
previous situation or to punish the author of the injury is a breach of the full
protection and security standard in the terms of the Parkerings v. Lithuania award
(Tr. H, p. 85, English version). The Prime Minister “was bound” by this obligation to
“induce SCA to change its attitude and to provide the compensation justifiably
requested by the Claimants” (SoC, p. 126).

Article |.2 of the 1977 BIT provides:

Such investments, goods, rights and interests shall also enjoy
continuous protection and security, excluding all unjustified or
discriminatory measures which would "de jure" or de facto" hinder their
management, maintenance, utilization, enjoyment or liquidation.

. Article 3.2 of the 2002 BIT also provides for continuous protection and security in

the following terms:
Such investment shall also enjoy continuous protection and security,

excluding any unjustified or discriminatory measure which could hinder
their management, maintenance, utilization, enjoyment or liquidation.

84

269.

270.

271.

272.

273.

274.

The notion of continuous protection and security is to be distinguished here from
the fair and equitable standard since they are placed in two different provisions of
the BIT, even if the two guarantees can overlap. As put forward by the Claimants,
this concept relates to the exercise of due diligence by the State*°.

As seen above and contrary to the Claimants’ allegation, the latter have not
established that there was an actual breach to be remedied. Indeed, the findings of
the Tribunal could lead to question the merits of the Claimants’ contractual case.
They have not established either that there has been any discriminatory measure,
or that the management and enjoyment of the investment was consequently
hindered.

On that basis and irrespective of the precise scope of the standard, the Tribunal
finds no breach of the Treaty.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE DUTY TO PROMOTE INVESTMENTS

The Claimants invoked a breach of the duty to promote investments with regards to
the Prime Minister (SoC, p. 126), and because no constructive attempt was made
by any organ of the State to find a solution and to address the Claimants’
predicament (Mem., 4 309).

The duty to promote investment is embodied in Article II.1 of the 1977 BIT in the
following terms:

Each Contracting Party shall admit to its territory investments by national
or legal persons of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its
legislation and shall encourage such investments.

And the BIT 2002 provides as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall promote investment on its territory by
investors of the other Contracting Party and shall accept and encourage
all investment in accordance with its legislation.

The Tribunal has pondered whether the intention of the Contracting Parties was to
create a positive duty as alleged by the Claimants (Mem., 4 312). This issue can be
left open. Indeed, even if such a concept entailed a positive duty on the part of the

See Campbell McLachlan, Laurence Shore, Matthew Weiniger, International Investment Arbitration,
(2007) OUP, 7.142.

85

275.

276.

277.

278.

279.

280.

State, it has not been established by the Claimants that the Respondent breached
this article in any manner, not even by an omission to act.

The Tribunal cannot concur with the Claimants that the fact that the JV had to
initiate local proceedings against the SCA before local courts and bring its claim
before the Committee for Settling the Complaints of the Investors constitutes a
failure of the Respondent to promote investment within its territory (Mem., | 309). A
BIT is not an insurance that an investor's claim will be satisfied, irrespective of the

merits of the claim.

For all the above reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Claimants’ case.

CcosTSsS

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

Each party asks that its opponent be ordered to bear the costs and expenses of the
arbitration and to pay legal costs (supra, 115 and 119). The Parties presented
their statements of costs on 11 March 2008, in the total amounts of € 2 342 305.40
and USD 352 000.00 for the Claimants and of EGP 253 089.05, £8 500.00,
€ 874 803.65 and USD 373 182.50 for the Respondent.

The Respondent also requested the Tribunal to order the Claimants to pay USD 5
million on the ground of “procédure abusive’.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DETERMINATION

The Claimants succeeded at the stage of jurisdiction and the Respondent prevailed
on the merits. The dispute raised serious and difficult issues, both factual and legal.
Both Parties cooperated in a very professional manner in the proceedings.

Taking these specific aspects into consideration and weighting all the
circumstances, the Tribunal in the exercise of its discretion in matters of allocation
of costs, finds it fair that the Parties bear the costs of the arbitration equally and
that each party bears its own legal and other costs.

86

281. The Tribunal further dismisses the Respondent's claim for compensation for
abusive proceedings as no abuse has been established and that no arguments
were satisfactorily put forward to justify such a claim, not to speak of its amount.

Vi. DECISION

282. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal makes the following decision:
. The claims are dismissed on the merits;
. The Parties shall bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares;
. Each party shall bear its own costs and legal fees;

. All other claims are dismissed.
